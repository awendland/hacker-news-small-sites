<div>
<p>There is an obvious reason to choose Julia:</p>
<blockquote><p>it's faster than other scripting languages, allowing you to have the rapid development of Python/MATLAB/R while producing code that is as fast as C/Fortran</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Newcomers to Julia might be a little wary of that statement.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why not just make other scripting languages faster? If Julia can do it, why can't others? </li>
<li>How do you interpert Julia benchmarks to confirm this? (This is surprisingly difficult for many!)</li>
<li>That sounds like it violates the No-Free-Lunch heuristic. Is there really nothing lost?</li>
</ol>
<p>Many people believe Julia is fast <strong>because it is Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled</strong> (i.e. every statement is run using compiled functions which are either compiled right before they are used, or cached compilations from before). This leads to questions about what Julia gives over JIT'd implementations of Python/R (and MATLAB by default uses a JIT). These JIT compilers have been optimized for far longer than Julia, so why should we be crazy and believe that somehow Julia quickly out-optimized all of them? However, that is a complete misunderstanding of Julia. What I want show, in a very visual way, is that Julia is fast because of its design decisions. The core design decision, <strong>type-stability through specialization via multiple-dispatch</strong> is what allows Julia to be very easy for a compiler to make into efficient code, but also allow the code to be very concise and "look like a scripting language". This will lead to some very clear performance gains.</p>
<p>But what we will see in this example is that Julia does not always act like other scripting languages. There are some "lunches lost" that we will have to understand. Understanding how this design decision effects the way you must code is crucial to producing efficient Julia code.</p>
<p>To see the difference, we only need to go as far as basic math.</p>

<h2 id="Arithmetic-in-Julia">Arithmetic in Julia<a href="#Arithmetic-in-Julia">¶</a></h2><p>In general, math in Julia looks the same as in other scripting languages. One detail to note is that the numbers are "true numbers", as in a <code>Float64</code> is truly the same thing as a 64-bit floating point number or a "double" in C. A <code>Vector{Float64}</code> is the same memory layout as an array of doubles in C, both making interop with C easy (indeed, in some sense "Julia is a layer on top of C") and it leads to high performance (the same is true for NumPy arrays).</p>
<p>Some math in Julia:</p>

<p>Note here that I showed off Julia's unicode tab completion. Julia allows for unicode characters, and these can be used by tab completing Latex-like statements. Also, multiplication by a number is allowed without the * if followed by a variable. For example, the following is allowed Julia code:</p>

<h2 id="Type-stability-and-Code-Introspection">Type-stability and Code Introspection<a href="#Type-stability-and-Code-Introspection">¶</a></h2><p>Type stability is the idea that there is only 1 possible type which can be outputtted from a method. For example, the reasonable type to output from <code>*(::Float64,::Float64)</code> is a <code>Float64</code>. No matter what you give it, it will spit out a <code>Float64</code>. This right here is multiple-dispatch: the <code>*</code> operator calls a different method depending on the types that it sees. When it sees floats, it will spit out floats. Julia provides code introspection macros so that way you can see what your code actually compiles to. Thus Julia is not just a scripting language, it's a scripting language which lets you deal with assembly! Julia, like many languages, compiles to LLVM (LLVM is a type of portable assembly language).</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>


<div>
<div>


<div>




<div>
<pre>; Function *
; Location: int.jl:54
define i64 @"julia_*_33751"(i64, i64) {
top:
  %2 = mul i64 %1, %0
  ret i64 %2
}
</pre>
</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>This output is saying that a floating point multiplication operation is performed and the answer is returned. We can even look at the assembly</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>


<div>
<div>


<div>




<div>
<pre>	.text
; Function * {
; Location: int.jl:54
	imulq	%rsi, %rdi
	movq	%rdi, %rax
	retq
	nopl	(%rax,%rax)
;}
</pre>
</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>This shows us that the <code>*</code> function has compiled down to exactly the same operation as what happens in C/Fortran, meaning it achieves the same performance (even though it's defined in Julia). Thus it is possible to not just get "close" to C, but actually get the same C code out. In what cases does this happen?</p>
<p>The interesting thing about Julia is that, asking which cases this happens is not the right question. the right question is, in what cases does the code not compile to something as efficient as C/Fortran? The key here is type-stability. If a function is type-stable, then the compiler can know what the type will be at all points in the function and smartly optimize it to the same assembly as C/Fortran. If it is not type-stable, Julia has to add expensive "boxing" to ensure types are found/known before operations.</p>
<h4 id="This-is-the-key-difference-between-Julia-and-other-scripting-languages">This is the key difference between Julia and other scripting languages<a href="#This-is-the-key-difference-between-Julia-and-other-scripting-languages">¶</a></h4><p>The upside is that Julia's functions, when type stable, are essentially C/Fortran functions. Thus <code>^</code> (exponentiation) is fast. However, <code>^(::Int64,::Int64)</code> is type-stable, so what type should it output?</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>


<div>
<div>
<p>Here we get an error. In order to guarantee to the compiler that <code>^</code> will give an Int64 back, it has to throw an error. If you do this in MATLAB, Python, or R, it will not throw an error. That is because those languages do not have their entire language built around type stability.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>What happens when we don't have type stability? Let's inspect this code:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>


<div>

<div>




<div>

	callq	*%rax
	popq	%rcx
	retq
	nop
;}
</pre>
</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Now let's define our own exponentiation on integers. Let's make it "safe" like the form seen in other scripting languages:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>In&nbsp;[8]:</p>

<div>
<pre>expo (generic function with 1 method)</pre>
</div>

</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Let's make sure it works:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>

</pre></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>



</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>What happens if we inspect this code?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<p>That's a very visual demonstration on why Julia achieves such higher performance than other scripting languages by how it uses type inference.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Type stability is one crucial feature which separates Julia apart from other scripting languages.  In fact, the core idea of Julia is the following statement:</p>
<h4 id="Multiple-dispatch-allows-for-a-language-to-dispatch-function-calls-onto-type-stable-functions.">Multiple dispatch allows for a language to dispatch function calls onto type-stable functions.<a href="#Multiple-dispatch-allows-for-a-language-to-dispatch-function-calls-onto-type-stable-functions.">¶</a></h4><p>This is what Julia is all about, so let's take some time to dig into it.If you have type stability inside of a function (meaning, any function call within the function is also type-stable), then the compiler can know the types of the variables at every step. Therefore it can compile the function with the full amount of optimizations since at this point the code is essentially the same as C/Fortran code.  Multiple-dispatch works into this story because it means that <code>*</code> can be a type-stable function: it just means different things for different inputs. But if the compiler can know the types of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> before calling <code>*</code>, then it knows which <code>*</code> method to use, and therefore it knows the output type of <code>c=a*b</code>. Thus it can propogate the type information all the way down, knowing all of the types along the way, allowing for full optimiziations. Multiple dispatch allows <code>*</code> to mean the "right thing" every time you use it, almost magically allowing this optimization.</p>
<p>There are a few things we learn from this. For one, in order to achieve this level of optimization, you must have type-stability. This is not featured in the standard libraries of most languages, and was choice that was made to make the experience a little easier for users. Secondly, multiple dispatch was required to be able to specialize the functions for types which allows for the scripting language syntax to be "more explicit than meets the eye". Lastly, a robust type system is required. In order to build the type-unstable exponentiation (which may be needed) we needed functionalities like convert. Thus the language must be designed to be type-stable with multiple dispatch and centered around a robust type system in order to achieve this raw performance while maintaining the syntax/ease-of-use of a scripting language. You can put a JIT on Python, but to really make it Julia, you would have to design it to be Julia.</p>

<h2 id="The-Julia-Benchmarks">The Julia Benchmarks<a href="#The-Julia-Benchmarks">¶</a></h2><p>The Julia benchmarks, featured on <a href="http://julialang.org/">the Julia website</a>, test components of the programming language for speed. <strong>This doesn't mean it's testing the fastest implemention</strong>. That is where a major misconception occurs. You'll have an R programmer look at the R code for the Fibonacci calculator and say "wow, that's terrible R code. You're not supposed to use recursion in R. Of course it's slow". However, the Fibonacci problem is designed to test recursion, not the fastest implementation to the the ith Fibonacci number. The other problems are the same way: testing basic components of the langauge to see how fast they are.</p>

    <p>
      I didn't want to be the guy write this post, but I am because Chris told
      me to so blame that fuckin guy. I'm a victim here.
    </p>

    <p>
      But you're all using <code>const</code> in JavaScript too much and it
      does bug me just ever so little.
    </p>

    <h3>1. <code>const</code> doesn't do shit and we all know it</h3>

    <p>
      For starters, let's agree that <code>const</code> is fucking useless and
      we're inventing meaning...
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>const</em> THIS_SHOULDNT_CHANGE = { right: "?" };
THIS_SHOULDNT_CHANGE.right = <em>"wrong"</em>;
THIS_SHOULDNT_CHANGE.<em>fucking</em> = <em>"deal with it"</em>;</code></pre>

    <p>
      <code>const</code> does not imply any kind of immutability of the value
      itself, it only implies immutability of the <em>binding</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Which... Cool.
    </p>

    <h3>2. The linters can't save you now</h3>

    <p>
      Let's also eliminate the idea that we could somehow statically enforce
      that <em>const</em> values are immutable with a linter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like, sure, you could for the simple case:
    </p>

    <pre><code>const FOO = { prop: true };
FOO.prop = false; <em>// LINT ERR &gt;XD</em></code></pre>

    <p>
      But then like... side effects exist and shit will hurt you
    </p>

    <pre><code>export function mutatesProp(obj) {
  obj.prop = false;
}</code></pre>

    <pre><code>import { mutatesProp } from './mutatesProp';
const FOO = { prop: true };
mutatesProp(FOO); <em>// no lint err :(</em></code></pre>

    <p>
      And yeah, type systems like Flow and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=have%20you%20tried%20typescript&amp;src=typd">HiHaveYouTriedTypeScriptYouShouldReallyTryTypeScriptIWriteTypeScriptAndImFuckingObnoxiousImGonnaStickMyHeadInAMicrowaveAndScreamTypeScript™</a> could do
      <em>something</em> with this, but like... they don't... sooooo
    </p>

    <h3>3. No it's not useful for compilers</h3>

    <p>
      You might be thinking, "Oh but it can still be used to optimize code or
      whatever"
    </p>

    <p>
      You would be right in thinking that compiler optimizations would make it
      interesting enough to use. But...
    </p>

    <p>
      You would be wrong in thinking that <code>const</code> is at all useful
      to optimizing compilers.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's already really really easy to identify a binding and figure out if
      it's never reassigned. All of the relevant optimizations are already
      possible without <code>const</code> ever being a thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, V8 and friends have been doing these optimizations without
      <code>const</code> for a really long time. Benedikt or Franziska or
      whoever can correct me if I'm wrong, but Babel definitely can already do
      this shit.
    </p>

    <h3>4. So what are we going to do?</h3>

    <p>
      First off, like... we don't <em>have</em> to <em>do</em> anything. There is no
      reason you would ever <em>have</em> to use <code>const</code>, and
      whereever we are using it, we could just as easily use <code>let</code>
      and our code wouldn't be impacted in any way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Honestly, if you just want to stop here and never use <code>const</code>
      again and never question it further, you will save literally whole...
      minutes of your life.
    </p>

    <p>
      But like... we <em>have</em> <code>const</code> so why don't we use it for
      <em>something</em> ...right? We could like use it to <strong><em>communicate</em></strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sure.
    </p>

    <h3>5. But what we've chosen to communicate is annoying as fuck</h3>

    <p>
      So, lots of people (okay maybe not you, you special little shit) are
      doing this... <em>thing</em> where they change every <code>let</code>
      variable which is never re-assigned to <code>const</code>.
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>let</em> answer = 42;
neverChangeTheAnswer(answer);
justKeepDoingOtherStuffWithTheValue(answer);</code></pre>

    <p>
      They would see the above code and say "that <code>let</code> should be a
      <code>const</code> so that the reader knows at the declaration of
      <code>answer</code> that it never changes."
    </p>

    <p>
      And many of them will include linter tools for enforcing that rule on
      every variable declaration, even sometimes applying the "fix"
      automatically.
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>const</em> answer = 42;
neverChangeTheAnswer(answer);
justKeepDoingOtherStuffWithTheValue(answer);</code></pre>

    <p>
      "That's better."
    </p>

    <p>
      But... is it better?
    </p>

    <p>
      Did you <em>really</em> mean to <strong><em>communicate</em></strong> that
      we should never change the <code>answer</code> or do we just
      <em>happen</em> to never change it?
    </p>

    <p>
      What if we came along later and decided we are okay changing the answer?
      But now it's a <code>const</code> and we aren't really sure if we're
      going to break someone's expectation for <code>answer</code> if we do
      change it.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are lots of bindings that we <em>happen</em> to never change that
      we're totally fine if they do change. In fact, that's probably true for
      <em>most</em> bindings. It's not something your code will generally care
      about.
    </p>

    <p>
      But by automatically applying this rule to every binding no matter what
      the author's actual intent was, we actually throw out our opportunity to
      <strong><em>communicate</em></strong> something.
    </p>

    <h3>6. So what should we actually use <code>const</code> for?</h3>

    <p>
      It's probably still a good idea to communicate that you really
      <em>don't</em> intend for something to be changed.
    </p>

    <p>
      But in order to communicate that, we need to only use it when
      appropriate.
    </p>

    <pre><code>const I_ACTUALLY_GIVE_A_SHIT_IF_THIS_CHANGES = 42;</code></pre>

    <p>
      If you want some good rules to follow, here's my best attempt:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>1. Only use <code>const</code> at the top level scope</strong>
    </p>

    <pre><code>const <em>HERE</em> = "is okay";

function nested() {
  const <em>NOT_HERE</em> = "never seen a reason to";
}</code></pre>

    <p>
      I'm pretty sure I've never seen a binding created in a function that will
      actually be upset if it changes. I never use <code>const</code> inside
      nested scopes, and I don't intend to. Why? Because my mom raised me
      right (see my usage of semicolons), that's why.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>2. Avoid using <code>let</code> at the top level scope</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, if you need to use <code>let</code> at the top-level
      scope, that's a sign you have some sort of global singleton state which
      could cause you problems.
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>let globalState</em> = "hmmm...";

function fn() {
  <em>globalState =</em> "this seems fragile to test...";
}</code></pre>

    <p>
      And like... that's basically it...
    </p>

    <p>
      And for the love of all that is not shit, please don't try enforcing this
      with a linter. Let people communicate what they want to communicate.
      Ya'll drive me crazy with that shit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now get the fuck out of my house.
    </p>

        <div id="post-body"><p>Earlier this week, I was doing some work on AWS and wanted to know what IP addresses were being used. Luckily for me, AWS publishes this all here <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json" rel="nofollow noopener">https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json</a>. When you go through this list, you’ll quickly see that AWS has a massive asset of IPv4 allocations. Just counting quickly I noticed a lot of big prefixes.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ever wondered what all of the AWS network ranges are?

</figure><p>However, the IPv4 ranges on that list are just the ranges that are in use and allocated today by AWS. Time to dig a bit deeper.</p><h3 id="ipv4-address-acquisitions-by-aws">IPv4 address acquisitions by AWS</h3><p>Over the years, AWS has acquired a lot of IPv4 address space. Most of this happens without gaining too much attention, but there were a few notable acquisitions that I’ll quickly summarize below.</p><h4 id="2017-mit-selling-8-million-ipv4-addresses-to-aws">2017: MIT selling 8 million IPv4 addresses to AWS</h4><p>In 2017 <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2017/05/mit-goes-on-ipv4-selling-spree/" rel="noopener">MIT sold half of its 18.0.0.0/8</a> allocation to AWS.

With this, AWS became the proud owner of its first /8! That’s sixteen million new IPv4 addresses to feed us hungry AWS customers. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18407173" rel="nofollow noopener">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18407173</a></p><h4 id="2019-aws-buys-amprnet-44-192-0-0-10">2019: AWS buys AMPRnet 44.192.0.0/10</h4><p>In 2019 AWS bought a /10 from AMPR.org, the Amateur Radio Digital Communications (ARDC). The IPv4 range 44.0.0.0/8 was an allocation made to the Amateur Radio organization in 1981 and known as the AMPRNet. This sell caused a fair bit of discussion, check out the <a href="https://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2019-July/thread.html#102103" rel="noopener">nanog discussion here.</a></p><p>Just this month, it <a href="http://www.southgatearc.org/news/2020/october/sale-of-amateur-radio-amprnet-tcp-ip-addresses.htm" rel="noopener">became public knowledge</a> AWS paid $108 million for this /10. That’s $25.74 per IP address.</p><p>These are just a few examples. Obviously, AWS has way more IP addresses than the three examples I listed here. The IPv4 transfer market is very active. Check out this website to get a sense of all transfers: <a href="https://account.arin.net/public/transfer-log#NRPM-8.3IPv4" rel="noopener">https://account.arin.net/public/transfer-log</a></p><h3 id="all-aws-ipv4-addresses">All AWS IPv4 addresses</h3><p>Armed with the information above it was clear that not all of the AWS owned ranges were in the <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json">JSON</a> that AWS published. For example, parts of the 3.0.0.0/8 range are missing. Likely because some of it is reserved for future use.</p><p>Combining all those IPv4 prefixes, removing duplicates and overlaps by aggregating them results in the following list of unique IPv4 address owned by AWS: <a href="https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#all-prefixes" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#all-prefixes</a></p><p>The total number of IPv4 addresses in that list is just over 100 Million (100,750,168).

That’s pretty healthy! And on top of that, I’m sure they’ll continue to source more IPv4 addresses. The IPv4 market is still hot!</p></div>

<![CDATA[What ORMs Have Taught Me: Just Learn SQL (2014)]]>

<![CDATA[

October 20, 2020 | https://wozniak.ca/blog/2014/08/03/1/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wozniak.ca/blog/2014/08/03/1/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p>
I’ve come to the conclusion that, for me, ORMs are more detriment than
benefit. In short, they can be used to nicely augment working with SQL
in a program, but they should not replace it.
</p>

<p>
Some background: For the past 30 months I’ve been working with code
that has to interface with Postgres and to some extent, SQLite. Most
of that has been with <a href="http://sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> (which I quite like) and <a href="http://hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a>
(which I don’t). I’ve worked with existing code and data models, as
well as designing my own. Most of the data is event-based storage
(“timelines”) with a heavy emphasis on creating reports.
</p>

<p>
Much has been written about the Object/Relational Impedance
Mismatch. It’s hard to appreciate it until you live it. Neward, in his
<a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/post/the-vietnam-of-computer-science/">well known essay</a>, lays out many cogent reasons why ORMs turn into
quagmires. In my experience, I’ve had to deal directly with a fair
number of them: <i>entity identity issues</i>, <i>dual-schema problem</i>, <i>data
retrieval mechanism concern</i>, and the <i>partial-object problem</i>. I want to
talk briefly about my experiences with these issues and add one of my
own.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orge4f50a6">
<h2 id="orge4f50a6">Partial objects, attribute creep, and foreign keys</h2>
<div id="text-orge4f50a6">
<p>
Perhaps the most subversive issue I’ve had with ORMs is “attribute
creep” or “wide tables”, that is, tables that just keep accruing
attributes. As much as I’d like to avoid it, sometimes it becomes
necessary (although things like <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/interactive/hstore.html">Postgres’ hstore</a> can help). For
example, a client may be providing you with lots of data that they
want attached to reports based on various business logic. Furthermore,
you don’t have much insight into this data; you’re just schlepping it
around.
</p>

<p>
This in and of itself isn’t a terrible thing in a database. It becomes
a real pain point with an ORM. Specifically, the problem starts to
show up in any query that uses the entity directly to create the
query. You may have a Hibernate query like so early on in the project.
</p>

<pre>query(Foo.class).add(Restriction.eq("x", value))
</pre>

<p>
This may be fine when Foo has five attributes, but becomes a data fire
hose when it has a hundred. This is the equivalent of using <code>SELECT
*</code>, which is usually saying more than what is intended. ORMs, however,
encourage this use and often make writing precise projections as
tedious as they are in SQL. (I have optimized such queries by adding
the appropriate projection and reduced the run time from minutes to
seconds; all the time was spent translating the database row into a
Java object.)
</p>

<p>
Which leads to another bad experience: the pernicious use of foreign
keys. In the ORMs I’ve used, links between classes are represented in
the data model as foreign keys which, if not configured carefully,
result in a large number of joins when retrieving the object. (A
recent count of one such table in my work resulted in over 600
attributes and 14 joins to access a single object, using the preferred
query methodology.)
</p>

<p>
Attribute creep and excessive use of foreign keys shows me is that in
order to use ORMs effectively, you still need to know SQL. My
contention with ORMs is that, if you need to know SQL, just use SQL
since it prevents the need to know how non-SQL gets translated to SQL.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2d7e33d">
<h2 id="org2d7e33d">Data retrieval</h2>
<div id="text-org2d7e33d">
<p>
Knowing how to write SQL becomes even more important when you attempt
to actually write queries using an ORM. This is especially important
when efficiency is a concern.
</p>

<p>
From what I’ve seen, unless you have a really simple data model (that
is, you never do joins), you will be bending over backwards to figure
out how to get an ORM to generate SQL that runs efficiently. Most of
the time, it’s more obfuscated than actual SQL.
</p>

<p>
And if you elect to keep the query simple, you end up doing a lot of
work in the code that could be done in the database faster. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function_%28SQL%29#Window_function">Window
functions</a> are relatively advanced SQL that is painful to write with
ORMs. Not writing them into the query likely means you will be
transferring a lot of extra data from the database to your
application.
</p>

<p>
In these cases, I’ve elected to write queries using a templating
system and describe the tables using the ORM. I get the convenience of
an application level description of the table with direct use of
SQL. It’s a lot less trouble than anything else I’ve used so far.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org05d550b">
<h2 id="org05d550b">Dual schema dangers</h2>
<div id="text-org05d550b">
<p>
This one seems to be one of those unavoidable redundancies.  If you
try to get rid of it, you only make more problems or add excessive
complexity.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that you end up having a data definition in two places:
the database and your application.  If you keep the definition
entirely in the application, you end up having to write the SQL Data
Definition Language (DDL) with the ORM code, which is the same
complication as writing advanced queries in the ORM.  If you keep it
in the database, you will probably want a representation in the
application for convenience and to prevent too much “string typing”.
</p>

<p>
I much prefer to keep the data definition in the database and read it
into the application.  It doesn’t solve the problem, but it makes it
more manageable.  I’ve found that reflection techniques to get the
data definition are not worth it and I succumb to managing the
redundancy of data definitons in two places.
</p>

<p>
But the damn migration issue is a real kick in the teeth: changing the
model is no big deal in the application, but a real pain in the
database.  After all, databases are persistent whereas application
data is not.  ORMs simply get in the way here because they don’t help
manage data migration at all.  I work on the principle that the
database’s data definitions aren’t things you should manipulate in the
application.  Instead, manipulate the results of queries.  That is,
the queries are your API to the database.  So instead of thinking
about objects, I think about functions with return types.
</p>

<p>
Thus, one is forced to ask, should you use an ORM for anything but
convenience in making queries?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7033826">
<h2 id="org7033826">Identities</h2>
<div id="text-org7033826">
<p>
Dealing with entity identities is one of those things that you have to
keep in mind at all times when working with ORMs, forcing you to write
for two systems while only have the expressivity of one.
</p>

<p>
When you have foreign keys, you refer to related identities with an
identifier. In your application, “identifier” takes on various
meanings, but usually it’s the memory location (a pointer). In the
database, it’s the state of the object itself. These two things don’t
really get along because you can really only use database identifiers
in the database (the ultimate destination of the data you’re working
with).
</p>

<p>
What this results in is having to manipulate the ORM to get a database
identifier by manually flushing the cache or doing a partial commit to
get the actual database identifier.
</p>

<p>
I can’t even call this a leaky abstraction because the work “leak”
implies small amounts of the contents escaping relative to the source.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgddbdda4">
<h2 id="orgddbdda4">Transactions</h2>
<div id="text-orgddbdda4">
<p>
Something that Neward alludes to is the need for developers to handle
transactions. Transactions are dynamically scoped, which is a powerful
but mostly neglected concept in programming languages due to the
confusion they cause if overused.  This leads to a lot of boilerplate
code with exception handlers and a careful consideration of where
transaction boundaries should occur.  It also makes you pass session
objects around to any function/method that might have to communicate
with the database.
</p>

<p>
The concept of a transaction translates poorly to applications due to
their reliance on context based on time. As mentioned, dynamic scoping
is one way to use this in a program, but it is at odds with lexical
scoping, the dominant paradigm. Thus, you must take great care to know
about the “when” of a transaction when writing code that works with
databases and can make modularity tricky (“Here’s a useful function
that will only work in certain contexts”).
</p>

<p>
Where do I see myself going?
</p>

<p>
At this point, I’m starting to question the wisdom behind the outright
rejection of <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?StoredProcedures">stored procedures</a>.  It sounds <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?StoredProceduresAreEvil">heretical</a>, but it may work
for my use cases.  (And hey, with the advent of “devops”, the divide
between the developer and the database administrator is basically
non-existent.)
</p>

<p>
I’ve found myself thinking about the database as just another data
type that has an API: the queries.  The queries return values of some
type, which are represented as some object in the program. By moving
away from thinking of the objects in my application as something to be
stored in a database (the raison d’être for ORMs) and instead thinking
of the database as a (large and complex) data type, I’ve found working
with a database from an application to be much simpler. And wondering
why I didn’t see it earlier.
</p>

<p>
(It should be made clear that I am not claiming this is how all
applications should deal with a database.  All I am saying is that
this fits my use case based on the data I am working with.)
</p>

<p>
Regardless of whether I find that stored procedures aren’t actually
that evil or whether I keep using templated SQL, I do know one thing:
I won’t fall into the “ORMs make it easy” trap. They are an acceptable
way to represent a data definition, but a poor way to write queries
and a bad way to store object state. If you’re using an RDBMS, bite
the bullet and learn SQL.

                <p>There are many factors that influence the delivery of software faster at reduced cost. According to
                    the WQR, slower time to market, increased QA costs and an over dependence on manual testing are a
                    major bottleneck in ensuring the release
                    of better products, faster.</p>
                <p>Its time every company shifted from Manual testing to Test Automation to address these challenges.
                </p>
                <p>The objective of software test automation is to simplify the software testing process as easy as
                    possible with minimum effort. Test Automation has a positive impact on the cost, quality and time to

                <p>Enhancements or changes made to an application must be tested and retested to check that it does not
                    break the existing code. Test Automation is most effective in performing such regression tests on
                    multiple device/OS/browser combinations
                    with the help of Automated testing tools.</p>
                <p>This would be a tedious task, if done manually. Functional Testers need to go through every feature
                    of the application, look for possible input combinations, compare and document each outcome with the
                    expected one.</p>
                <p>In such short cycles it is difficult to test every feature of the application, manually. Manual
                    Testing would require a lot of resources, time and cost for this.</p>
                <p>Without Test Automation one has to compromise on the test coverage, which is not recommended.</p>
                <p>However, Manual Testing cannot be overlooked as it involves creative and logical analysis of the
                    application under test.</p>
                <p>There is a need of an integrated manual testing and test automation environment to improve the
                    collaboration between the teams and increase productivity. </p><br>

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>

                            Test Automation speeds up the testing process</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Once created, automated tests can be run over and again at no additional cost and can increase
                        the pace of executing tests in different versions of device, browser and OS combinations. This
                        reduces the testing time in each cycle.</p>
                </li>

                            Test Automation increases Test Coverage</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>As the tests are automated you can choose to execute some or all of the tests to cover the
                        affected areas. You don't need to compromise on the coverage due to a lack of time towards the
                        end of the cycle.</p>
                    <p>Execute multiple complex tests across different OS/Device/Browser combinations and with different
                        Test Data sets that help increase the test coverage.</p>

                        <strong>Test Automation improves Accuracy</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Test Automation tools execute a set of scripted steps systematically and record the results every
                        time they are executed. The accuracy of results are more in less time compared to Manual
                        testing.</p>

                            Test Automation allows for faster delivery of products</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Once the test script is developed, the tests can be re-executed any number of times, anytime.
                        This allows the Functional testers to do exploratory testing and to check for the usability of
                        the product. Test Automation allows for a speedy delivery of better quality products into the
                        market.

                <h3>Getting started with Test Automation</h3>
                <p>Test Automation is not just about programming the test actions. It is an ecosystem of various
                    components and resources like the test automation team, test automation tools, test environments,
                    proper management of test data, integrations
                    that help deliver quality software faster.</p>

                        <p> Expertise in multiple tools and technologies for different application types</p>
                    </li>

                        <p> Need for training on the tools being used </p>
                    </li>

                        <p> Availability of realistic Test Environments to try and execute tests </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><i></i>
                        <p> Integrations with multiple tools like Test Management tool, Test Data Management tool, CI/CD
                            tools, Defect tracking and reporting tools, Collaboration tools etc. </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>It takes significant time and effort to set the Test Automation ecosystem. Each application type
                    would require different sets of tools and one tool that suffices every application type hardly
                    exist. Though Test Automation is the right
                    choice in identifying and fixing bugs at an early stage, there are several tailbacks associated with
                    it.</p>
                <p>This initial demand of cost, resources, time and effort, makes it difficult for smaller teams to get
                    started with Test Automation.

        <p>About 6 years ago, when I was in my first few months at Pebble as a firmware engineer, I decided to take an entire workday to read through the majority of the GDB manual. It was by far one of my best decisions as an early professional engineer. After that day, I felt like I was 10x faster at debugging the Pebble firmware and our suite of unit tests. I even had a new <code>.gdbinit</code> script with a few macros and configuration flags to boot, which I continue to amend to this day.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve learned from many firmware developers and am here writing this post to share what I’ve learned along the way. If you have any comments or suggestions about this post, I would love to hear from you in <a href="https://interrupt-slack.herokuapp.com/">Interrupt’s Slack channel</a>.</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->

<p>In this reference-style post, we discuss some of the more advanced and powerful commands of the GNU debugger, GDB, as well as cover some of the best practices and hacks I’ve found over the years that help make GDB more pleasant to use.</p>

<!-- excerpt end -->

<p>Although there might be debuggers and interfaces out there that provide better experiences than using GDB directly, many of them are built on top of GDB and provide raw access to the GDB shell, where you can build and use automation through the <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/automate-debugging-with-gdb-python-api">Python scripting API</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the end of most of the sections, there are links to either subpages with the <a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/">GDB manual</a> or to the original content to learn more about the topic discussed.</p>

<h2 id="essentials">Essentials</h2>

<p>First, we need to cover the items which I feel are most important for any developer or team to work efficiently within GDB.</p>



<p>There’s no better place to start learning GDB than to first learn how to search the help menus. Surprisingly, or maybe unsurprisingly, GDB has over 1500+ commands!</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Count number of GDB commands in the master help list
$ gdb --batch -ex 'help all' | grep '\-\-' | wc
    1512   16248  117306
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this in mind, the most useful command within GDB is <code>apropos</code>, which searches all the “help” menus of each command. To use it, simply type <code>apropos &lt;regex&gt;</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) apropos symbol
add-symbol-file -- Load symbols from FILE, assuming FILE has been dynamically loaded.
add-symbol-file-from-memory -- Load the symbols out of memory from a dynamically loaded object file.
attach -- Attach to a process or file outside of GDB.
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To get the individual help menu of any command in GDB, just type <code>help &lt;command&gt;</code>, and GDB will output everything it knows about the command or subcommand.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) help apropos
Search for commands matching a REGEXP
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If help is used on a collection of commands:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) help info
Generic command for showing things about the program being debugged.

List of info subcommands:

info address -- Describe where symbol SYM is stored.
info all-registers -- List of all registers and their contents, for selected stack frame.
info args -- All argument variables of current stack frame or those matching REGEXPs.
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb.html#index-apropos">Reference</a></p>

<h3 id="gdb-history">GDB History</h3>

<p>Next, we need to ensure that command history is enabled.</p>

<p>By default GDB does not save any history of the commands that were run during each session. This is especially annoying because GDB supports <code>CTRL+R</code> for history search just like your shell!</p>

<p>To fix this, we can place the following in our <code>.gdbinit</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>set history save on
set history size 10000
set history filename ~/.gdb_history
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this in place, GDB will now keep the last 10,000 commands in a file ~/.gdb_history.</p>

<p><a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Command-History.html">Reference</a></p>

<h3 id="sharing-gdbinit-files">Sharing <code>.gdbinit</code> Files</h3>

<p>I’m a huge believer in developer productivity, and I try my best to share my best-practices with co-workers and the greater community. In the past, I’ve made it a point to have per-project GDB configuration files that are automatically loaded for everyone by default.</p>

<p>This could be in a bash script <code>debug.sh</code> which developers use instead of typing <code>gdb</code> and all the arguments by hand:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>

gdb build/symbols.elf <span>\</span>
    <span>-ix</span><span>=</span>./gdb/project.gdbinit <span>\</span>
    <span>--ex</span><span>=</span><span>'source ./gdb/extra_gdb.py'</span> <span>\</span>
	<span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Better yet, you can build a <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/building-a-cli-for-firmware-projects">Project CLI using Invoke</a> which wraps the GDB invocation into an <code>invoke debug</code> command.</p>

<p>This ensures that everyone working on the project has the latest set of configuration flags and <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/automate-debugging-with-gdb-python-api">GDB Python scripts</a> to accelerate their debugging.</p>

<h2 id="source-files">Source Files</h2>

<p>With the essentials out of the way, let’s dive into learning GDB! The first thing to talk about is how best to view and navigate the source code while debugging.</p>

<h3 id="directory-search-paths">Directory Search Paths</h3>

<p>Many times, the CI system builds with absolute paths instead of paths relative to the project root, which causes GDB not to be able to find the source files.</p>

<p>It will produce an error like below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) f 1
#2  cli_state_collect (p_cli=0x3ad00 &lt;m_cli&gt;) at
    ../nrf5_sdk/components/libraries/cli/nrf_cli.c:1952
1952	../nrf5_sdk/components/libraries/cli/nrf_cli.c:
    No such file or directory.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you are proactive and want to fix this permanently in the build step, you can follow the steps in Interrupt’s post about <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/reproducible-firmware-builds">Reproducible Firmware Builds</a> to make the paths relative.</p>

<p>If you want to patch it up now in GDB, you can use a combination of the <code>set substitute-path</code> and <code>directory</code> commands in GDB, depending on how the paths are built.</p>

<p>To fix the above issue, all I needed to do was to add a local directory. After adding it, GDB can find the source code of the line in the frame.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) directory sdk/embedded/platforms/nrf5/nrf5_sdk/
Source directories searched: /[...]/sdk/embedded/platforms/nrf5/nrf5_sdk:$cdir:$cwd
(gdb) f 1
#1  0x000292a2 in cli_execute (p_cli=0x3ad00 &lt;m_cli&gt;) at
    ../nrf5_sdk/components/libraries/cli/nrf_cli.c:2554
2554	        p_cli-&gt;p_ctx-&gt;p_current_stcmd-&gt;handler(p_cli,
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Source-Path.html">Reference</a></p>

<h3 id="source-context-with-list">Source Context with <code>list</code></h3>

<p>Sometimes, you just want to quickly add a few lines above and below the current line. To quickly view ten lines of source-code context within GDB, you can use the <code>list</code> command.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) list
2549	                &amp;p_static_entry,
2550	                &amp;static_entry);
2551
2552	        p_cli-&gt;p_ctx-&gt;p_current_stcmd = p_static_entry;
2553
2554	        p_cli-&gt;p_ctx-&gt;p_current_stcmd-&gt;handler(p_cli,
2555	                                               argc - cmd_handler_lvl,
2556	                                               &amp;argv[cmd_handler_lvl]);
2557	    }
2558	    else if (handler_cmd_lvl_0 != NULL)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you want to set a larger or smaller default number of lines shown with this command, you can change the setting:</p>

<h3 id="viewing-assembly-with-disassemble">Viewing Assembly With <code>disassemble</code></h3>

<p>It’s often useful to dive into the assembly of a specific function. GDB has this capability built-in and can even interleave the source code with the assembly (by using the <code>/s</code> option).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) disassemble /s nrf_cli_cmd_echo_on
Dump of assembler code for function nrf_cli_cmd_echo_on:
nrf_cli.c:
3511	{
3512	    if (nrf_cli_build_in_cmd_common_executed(p_cli, (argc != 1), NULL, 0))
   0x0002969c &lt;+0&gt;:	ldr	r3, [r0, #8]
   0x0002969e &lt;+2&gt;:	ldr.w	r2, [r3, #316]	; 0x13c

nrf_cli.h:
604	    return p_cli-&gt;p_ctx-&gt;internal.flag.show_help;
   0x000296a2 &lt;+6&gt;:	lsls	r2, r2, #30
   0x000296a4 &lt;+8&gt;:	bmi.n	0x296b8 &lt;nrf_cli_cmd_echo_on+28&gt;

nrf_cli.c:
3391	    if (arg_cnt_nok)
   0x000296a6 &lt;+10&gt;:	cmp	r1, #1
   0x000296a8 &lt;+12&gt;:	bne.n	0x296bc &lt;nrf_cli_cmd_echo_on+32&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you want something more powerful than <code>disassemble</code>, you can use <code>objdump</code> itself. Interrupt’s <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/gnu-binutils#objdump">post on GNU Binutils</a> is a great reference for this.</p>

<p><a href="http://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Machine-Code.html">Reference</a></p>

<h2 id="gdb-visual-interfaces">GDB Visual Interfaces</h2>

<p>There are many visual interfaces that are built into or on top of GDB. Let’s go through a few of the most popular ones.</p>

<h3 id="gdb-tui">GDB TUI</h3>

<p>GDB has a built-in graphical interface for viewing source code, registers, assembly, and other various items, and it’s quite simple to use!</p>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/advanced-gdb/gdb-tui.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can start the TUI interface by running:</p>



<p>This should give you the source code viewer. You are now able to type <code>next</code>, <code>step</code>, <code>continue</code>, etc. and the TUI interface will update and follow along.</p>

<p>If you want to view the assembly as well, you can run:</p>



<p>To show the registers at the top of the window, you can type:</p>



<h3 id="alternate-gdb-interfaces">Alternate GDB Interfaces</h3>

<p>Although TUI is nice, I don’t know many people who use it and see it more as a gimmick. It’s great for quick observations and exploration, but I would suggest spending the 15-30 minutes to get something set up that is more powerful and permanent.</p>

<p>I would suggest looking into using <a href="https://github.com/cyrus-and/gdb-dashboard">gdb-dashboard</a> or <a href="https://github.com/vim-scripts/Conque-GDB">Conque-GDB</a> if you’d like to stick with using GDB itself.</p>

<p>For a full list of GUI enhancements to GDB, you can check out the list of plugins from my <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/gdbundle-plugin-manager#neat-gdb-script-repositories">previous post on GDBundle</a>.</p>

<h3 id="gdbgui">gdbgui</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gdbgui.com/">gdbgui</a> is a browser-based frontend to GDB, built by Chad Smith, who also happens to be the author of another one of my favorite tools, <a href="https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx">pipx</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cs01/gdbgui/master/screenshots/gdbgui.png" alt=""></p>

<p>gdbgui is great tool if you don’t want to use a vendor-provided debugger but still want to have a visual way to interface with GDB.</p>

<h3 id="vscode">VSCode</h3>

<p>VSCode has pretty good support for GDB baked in. If you are just using GDB to debug C/C++ code locally on your machine, you should be able to follow the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/cpp-debug">official instructions</a>.</p>

<p>If you are looking to do remote debugging on devices connected with OpenOCD, PyOCD, or JLink, you’ll want to look into the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide">Platform.io</a> or <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marus25.cortex-debug">Cortex-Debug</a> extensions.</p>

<h2 id="registers">Registers</h2>

<p>The next topic to cover is interacting with registers through GDB.</p>

<h3 id="printing-registers">Printing Registers</h3>

<p>You can print the register values within GDB using <code>info registers</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) info registers
r0             0x2                 2

<p>The term technical debt is so common that you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone in the software world that hasn’t heard of it. But what <em>is </em>technical debt? There are a few frameworks out there, so I’ll list them quickly, but I’d like to present one I’ve found especially useful with the teams I work on or advise.</p>



<h4>Existing Frameworks</h4>



<p>First, it’s helpful to define what technical debt is <em>not</em>. Bob Martin has a great article on this called <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/a-mess-is-not-a-technical-debt">A Mess is not a Technical Debt</a>. “A mess is just a mess”. You can make short-term decisions that may not be best for the long-term, if you’re under constraints, but you should still do it in a prudent way.</p>



<p>Martin Fowler expands on this by creating a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html">Technical Debt Quadrant</a>, with two dimensions: deliberate vs. inadvertent, and reckless vs. prudent.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/37Nx_D515LmtBbvoQEq0CjgtoEzjdBur2GBmJ2bklYsXQLlwlB0vSI6awa7KqUmG5Kdx7ADsI9ukzSoJZLnMg_sXF2ph6pJbr1LGR7YS9ubiKZr9TWtMpsLb_Srm89vfSEtbkiUO" alt=""></figure>



<p>Ideally, you’re in the right half of this two-by-two: always prudent, because there’s no excuse for being reckless. But, if you’re low on experience for the type of system you’re designing, you might be prudent and inadvertent. Martin Fowler argues that prudent / inadvertent is really common with great designers, because they are always learning.</p>



<p>One of my favorite frameworks is from the Mythical Man-Month’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">No Silver Bullet</a> essay. Fred Brooks breaks down complexity (which is a little different than technical debt) into to dimensions: accidental complexity and essential complexity. Essential complexity is caused by the complexity of the underlying problem that software solves—accidental complexity is introduced by the implementation developers take. In this world, technical debt is, essentially all accidental complexity.</p>



<p>A final framework defines technical debt as the gap between how software is structured and how you would structure it if you were writing it from scratch today (I don’t remember where I read this definition, please tell me if you do!). In this world, technical debt is a little more fluid, because it can increase simply by your team thinking up a better architecture or design.</p>



<h4>A different framework—manifestations</h4>



<p>These frameworks are all great, and in fact, you can go even deeper to define what technical debt <em>looks like</em>. Books like Refactoring and Clean Code have done this well. But usually, what you need, is something a little more concrete that you can make decisions about.</p>



<p>So the framework I like to use is to look at <em>manifestations</em> of technical debt; what impact does it have?</p>



<p>At a high-level, technical debt can manifest itself in two ways:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Interrupts:</strong> Interrupts are when existing systems are taxing your time through reactive work like maintenance, bugs, fire-fighting, etc, so you spend less time being able to change a system. In other words, writing code now that creates interrupts in the future means you (or someone else) will be able to spend less time on forward work in the future. Both the quantity and severity of interrupts matter. Interrupts are particularly hazardous because they usually result in forced context switching.</li><li><strong>Inertia: </strong>Inertia means that a system is hard to make forward changes to (because it is hard to understand or reason about, because it’s not modular and hence hard to change, etc). This makes forward work difficult for you (ie even when you can spend time doing forward work, it’s really slow) or for others (e.g. because the system is hard to understand, it is a tax on the time of people who need to learn more about it, as well as on people who need to explain to others how it works).</li></ul>



<p>Why look at the manifestations? Two reasons.</p>



<p>First, it helps identify the tangible symptoms and effect of technical debt, and helps avoid theoreticals. For instance, most teams have at least one part of their code base that they feel pretty bad about, and would love to spend time fixing. Is it worth fixing now? Sometimes, that code is well-isolated and pretty functional. It isn’t creating any interrupts. No one is changing it or will need to change it in the near future. So yes, it is technical debt, and it might have inertia, but inertia only matters if that code needs to be changed.</p>



<p>Secondly, by identifying the effects of technical debt, you can decide how best to fix it. For instance, if a piece of code is really hard to change because it suffers from <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Software_Design/Change_amplification#:~:text=As%20a%20code%20quality%2C%20change,atomic%20change%20to%20the%20software.">change amplification</a>, and you expect to be making a lot of changes to it, it’s probably worth refactoring. If a piece of code is creating a lot of interrupts and not creating value for users, you might want to just get rid of it entirely.</p>



<p>So sometimes, it’s useful to start with the symptoms before the diagnoses, and look at how technical debt manifests itself before deciding what to do about it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few weeks ago I added <a href="https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-clarifies-jamstack-remarks#comment-344626">this comment in WPTavern</a>, on an article where WordPress founder's Matt Mullenweg clarifies his earlier remarks that the Jamstack is "a regression for the vast majority of the people adopting it".</p><p>Since I like owing my own content, I reproduce it here in my own blog.</p><hr><p>I think Matt’s brutal honesty is welcome, because most information out there about the Jamstack praises it. However, it also comes from developers using these modern new tools, evaluating their own convenience and satisfaction. As Matt points out, that doesn’t mean it makes it easier for the end user to use the software, which is what WordPress is good at.</p><p>I actually like the Jamstack, but because of how complex it is, it’s rather limiting, even to support some otherwise basic functionality.</p><p>The definitive example is comments, which should be at the core websites building communities. WordPress is extremely good at supporting comments in the site. The Jamstack is sooooo bad at it. In all these many years, nobody has been able to solve comments for the Jamstack, which for me evidences that it is inherently unsuitable to support this feature.</p><p>All attempts so far have been workarounds, not solutions. Eg:</p><ul><li>Netlify forms: no hierarchy, so can post a comment but not a response (unless adding some meta to the comment body? how ugly is that?)</li><li>Storing comments in a GitHub repo: it takes a long time to merge the PR with the comment</li></ul><p>Also, all these solutions are overtly complicated. Do I need to set-up a webhook to trigger a new build just to add a comment? And then, maybe cache the new comment in the client’s LocalStorage for if the user refreshes the page immediately, before the new build is finished? Seriously?</p><p>And then, they don’t provide the killer feature: to send notifications of the new comment to all parties involved in the discussion. That’s how communities get built, and websites become successful. Speed is a factor. But more important than speed, it is dynamic functionality to support communities. The website may look fancy, but it may well become a ghost town.</p><p>(Btw, as an exercise, you can research which websites started as WordPress and then migrated to the Jamstack, and check how many comments they had then vs now… the numbers will, most likely, be waaaaaaay down)</p><p>Another way is to not pre-render the comments, but render them dynamically after fetching it with an API. Yes, this solution works, but then you still have WordPress (or some other CMS) in the back-end to store the comments :P</p><p>The final option is to use 3rd parties such as Disqus to handle this functionality for you. Then, I will be sharing my users’ data with the 3rd party, and they may use it who knows how, and for the benefit of who (most likely, not my users’). Since I care about privacy, that’s a big no for me.</p><p>As a result, my own blog, which is a Jamstack site, doesn’t support comments! What do I do if I want feedback on a blog post? I add a link to a corresponding tweet, asking to add a comment there. I myself feel ashamed at this compromise, but given my site’s stack, I don’t see how I can solve it.</p><p>I still like my blog as a Jamstack, though, because it’s fast, it’s free, and I create all the blog posts in Markdown using VSCode. But I can’t create a community! So, as Matt says, there are things the Jamstack can handle. But certainly not everything. And possibly, not the one(s) that enable your your website to become successful.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Network programming is something that can be tricky in every programming language. Fortunately all network programming makes use of BSD sockets, a paradigm that almost universal in all modern operating systems and programming languages.</p><p>In this article, I'll show you how you can program sockets in Lisp using the SBCL implementation. You see, the Common Lisp specification has no specification for socket programming. So every Lisp compiler is free to specify it's own implementation.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: This is a first version of this article and only focusses on writing a Lisp server. I'll update this article later to include a Lisp client.</p><div id="general-flow-for-sockets">
<h2>General flow for sockets</h2>
<p>All systems making use of network sockets follow a similar flow. The flow does differ between client and server implementations.</p>
<p>The first step is to <strong>create a socket</strong> and set the desired <strong>socket options</strong>. Next you have to <strong>bind</strong> the socket to a specific address. An <em>address</em> in socket programming is a combination of an IP address and a port number. After the socket is bound to an address, the server can listen to incoming connections of clients.</p>
</div><div id="writing-a-lisp-server">
<h2>Writing a Lisp server</h2>
<p>Let's start by writing a simple server in Lisp. Note that this code won't work just yet, follow along.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>defparameter</span> <span>*address*</span> <span>#(</span><span>0</span> <span>0</span> <span>0</span> <span>0</span><span>))</span>
<span>(</span><span>defparameter</span> <span>*port*</span> <span>8080</span><span>)</span>

<span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>start-server</span> <span>()</span>
    <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>((</span><span>server</span> <span>(</span><span>make-instance</span> <span>'sb-bsd-sockets:inet-socket</span> <span>:type</span> <span>:stream</span> <span>:protocol</span> <span>:tcp</span><span>)))</span>
        <span>; Set socket options</span>
        <span>(</span><span>setf</span> <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:sockopt-reuse-address</span> <span>server</span><span>)</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span>
        <span>(</span><span>setf</span> <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:non-blocking-mode</span> <span>server</span><span>)</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span>

        <span>; Bind to an address</span>
        <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:socket-bind</span> <span>server</span> <span>*address*</span> <span>*port*</span><span>)</span>
        <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:socket-listen</span> <span>server</span> <span>1</span><span>)))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>First we define two parameters, <strong>address</strong> and <strong>port</strong>. The <strong>address</strong> parameter is a vector respresenting the <em>IP address 0.0.0.0</em>. The <strong>port</strong> parameter is the integer 8080. Binding our socket to this address will let it listen on all IP addresses of the computer we run this program on.</p>
<p>In the <em>start-server</em> function we first create a socket by creating an instance of <em>inet-socket</em>. Next we set the options and then bind it to the address. Finally we start listening on the socket.</p>
<p>Next we have to accept any client connections and handle those connections. For our example we will create a server that will echo everything a client sends and then close the connection.</p>
<p>Let's update our <em>start-server</em> function to accept connections and pass the connection to a handler function. To make reading from the socket a bit easier, I've added a helper function <em>read-from-connection</em>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>start-server</span> <span>()</span>
    <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>((</span><span>server</span> <span>(</span><span>make-instance</span> <span>'sb-bsd-sockets:inet-socket</span> <span>:type</span> <span>:stream</span> <span>:protocol</span> <span>:tcp</span><span>)))</span>
        <span>; Set socket options</span>
        <span>(</span><span>setf</span> <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:sockopt-reuse-address</span> <span>server</span><span>)</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span>
        <span>(</span><span>setf</span> <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:non-blocking-mode</span> <span>server</span><span>)</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span>

        <span>; Bind to an address</span>
        <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:socket-bind</span> <span>server</span> <span>*address*</span> <span>*port*</span><span>)</span>

        <span>(</span><span>loop</span>

 <span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>read-from-connection</span> <span>(</span><span>connection</span><span>)</span>
     <span>"Read data from a connection."</span>
     <span>(</span><span>multiple-value-bind</span> <span>(</span><span>buffer</span> <span>length</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:socket-receive</span> <span>connection</span> <span>nil</span> <span>1024</span><span>)</span>

                 <span>(</span><span>subseq</span> <span>buffer</span> <span>0</span> <span>length</span><span>)</span>
                 <span>data</span><span>))))</span>

 <span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>handle-connection</span> <span>(</span><span>connection</span><span>)</span>
     <span>"Handle an incoming connection."</span>
     <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>((</span><span>data</span> <span>(</span><span>read-from-connection</span> <span>connection</span><span>)))</span>
         <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:socket-send</span> <span>connection</span> <span>data</span> <span>nil</span><span>)</span>
         <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:socket-close</span> <span>connection</span><span>)))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>As you can see we had to do some processing of the data received from the socket. Our function <em>read-from-connection</em> reads up to 1024 bytes from the connection. Lisp has to <em>allocate</em> an entire buffer of that length, but only a certain number of bytes are received. So we simple return the part of the buffer equal to the length of the data written.</p>
<p>In the <em>handle-connection</em> function, we read data from the connection using our helper function. Then we simply send that data back to the connection by using the <strong>socket-send</strong> function, and finally close our socket by making use of the <strong>socket-close</strong> function.</p>
<p>To connect to our server you can use the telnet command on your computer:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>michael@winston:~<span>|</span>⇒  telnet <span>127</span>.0.0.1 <span>9000</span>
Trying <span>127</span>.0.0.1...
Connected to <span>127</span>.0.0.1.
Escape character is <span>'^]'</span>.
Lisp is amazing!
Lisp is amazing!
Connection closed by foreign host.
</pre></div>
<p>As you can see the telnet commands establishes a connection. We then enter something ("Lisp is amazing!" in my example) and press enter. The server immediately echos back what we sent it and closes the connection.</p>
<p>The complete example up untill now can be found in the <a href="https://sinax.be/code/echo-server-threaded.lisp">simple echo server</a> file.</p>
<div id="handling-multiple-client-connections">
<h3>Handling multiple client connections</h3>
<p>Our design has one important flaw. Because of the way our server handles connections, only one connection can be handled by our server at a time.</p>
<p>You can test this out by connecting two telnet sessions to our server, just connect but don't send anything just yet. If you send a string to our server on the second telnet session, you won't get an immediate reply. The connection will stay open, without a response, untill the first session is finished. Send something through the first telnet session and you'll notice the second session will get a response and close after the first session does.</p>
<p>If you take a look at the flow of our server, you'll see that our loop that accepts connections is 'kept busy' by our <em>handle-connection</em> function. We can't accept new connections while our <em>handle-connection</em> function hasn't finished. In this particular case, the impact is negligible: since we simple read, send and then close the connection we will quickly return to the loop accepting connections. But image if our connection handler would keep the connection alive and read multiple times from a connection? Bad design!</p>
<p>Luckily, we can easily fix this by starting a new thread for each connection and handle the connection in the new thread.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>handle-connection</span> <span>(</span><span>connection</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span><span>sb-thread:make-thread</span>
        <span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>()</span>
            <span>; Handle our connection in this lambda, which is run in a new thread</span>
            <span>(</span><span>loop</span>
                <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>((</span><span>data</span> <span>(</span><span>read-from-connection</span> <span>connection</span><span>)))</span>
                    <span>; Do something with the data received</span>
                    <span>))</span>
            <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:socket-close</span> <span>connection</span><span>))))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>We changed our <em>handle-connection</em> function to make a new thread. That thread will spin off from the main server thread and continue on its own. While the thread is running it's own loop in this case, the server is free to accept new connections that will be handled by threads of their own.</p>
<p>If you test our server with two telnet session like we did before, you'll notice our server now responds as expected. The fact that one client was connected first, but hasn't finished yet, makes no difference when handling a second client.</p>
<p>The full example can be found in the <a href="https://sinax.be/code/echo-server-threaded.lisp">threaded echo server</a> file.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL has become a widely adopted standard over the past few years. However, not everyone is taking advantage of the full capabilities of the standard. In this article, I’ll demonstrate methods for creating more expressive schemas that better fit your data needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s start by defining an example scenario. We’re building a forum application, which will have several types of users:</p><ul role="list"><li>Standard users that post and read content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Moderators that oversee forum postings and police activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Administrators that manage the operations of the forum. For example, dealing with technical issues, assigning moderators, and more.</li></ul><p>What might a schema for such a site look like? Let’s start off with a barebones schema. This example will be using a Node Express and GraphQL project. I’ll assume you already know how to do that, but I will include the entire project code at the bottom of the article later. Create a typeDefs.ts file like this. Notice that we’re using TypeScript, since the type annotations help make the code more clear.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>
import { gql } from "apollo-server-express"; 
 
const typeDefs = gql` 
  type StandardUser { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
    stars: Int! 
  } 
 
  type Moderator { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
    stars: Int! 
    categories: [Category!] 
  } 
 
  type Administrator { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
  } 
 
  type Category { 
    id: ID! 
    name: String! 
  } 
`; 
 
export default typeDefs; 
</code>
</pre></div><p>‍</p><p>You’ll notice that we have the three user types, and an additional type called Category, which represents the group that our posts will go into. However it’s clear there is repetition across our fields (e.g. id, username). It’s in fact possible to pull out a “base type” from each of the three user related types. Let’s attempt to do this by updating this schema using Interfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Interfaces&nbsp;</h3><p>An interface is just a skeleton of sorts. It’s a contract that declares rules, in this case specific fields, however it has no implementation and therefore cannot return data. Only types can. However since it does provide structure, we are using Interfaces to define base fields and then have our types implement those Interfaces. For example, if we update our typeDefs with Interfaces it could look like this.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>
const typeDefs = gql` 
  interface Identifiable { 
    id: ID! 
  } 
 
  interface User implements Identifiable { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
  } 
 
  interface Rating { 
    stars: Int! 
  } 
 
  type StandardUser implements Identifiable &amp; User &amp; Rating { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
    stars: Int! 
  } 
 
  type Moderator implements Identifiable &amp; User &amp; Rating { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
    stars: Int! 
    categories: [Category!] 
  } 
 
  type Administrator implements Identifiable &amp; User { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
  } 
 
  type Category implements Identifiable { 
    id: ID! 
    name: String! 
  } 
`; 
</code>
</pre></div><p>‍</p><p>If we start at the top, you’ll see our first interface is called Identifiable. Since all of the entities in our data model have a unique ID, this interface will be the base for all of our entities. Next, we see that the User interface implements the Identifiable interface. Notice how User has both the id field and its own field called userName. When a type or interface implements an interface, they must implement all of its fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Next up we have another interface called Rating. Since two of our types StandardUser and Moderator use the stars field, but Administrator does not, we have this interface so that only the types that use the stars field can implement it – otherwise, the User models can skip it.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, we finally have our actual types StandardUser, Moderator, and Administrator, where each one implements only the interfaces it needs by using an &amp; symbol to denote more than one interface being implemented. Then lastly the Category type.&nbsp;</p><p>So, as you can see this set of types and hierarchies is quite reminiscent of most modern programming languages, for example TypeScript.</p><p>We now have a reasonable schema model. Let’s try querying it. Update the typeDefs variable by adding this Query.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>
type Query { 
    getAllUsers: [User!] 
} 
</code>
</pre></div><p>As you can see, we’ve added a function that retrieves all of our site’s users, but returns them as an array of Users. Let’s now write our resolver and see if this will work. First create your resolver file like the following:</p><div><pre><code>
import { IResolvers } from "apollo-server-express"; 
import { getAllUsers, User } from "../dataService"; 
import { GqlContext } from "./GqlContext"; 
 
const resolvers: IResolvers = { 
  Query: { 
    getAllUsers: async ( 
      parent, 
      args: null, 
      ctx: GqlContext, 
      info: any 
	): Promise<array<user>&gt; =&gt; { 
      return getAllUsers(); 
	}, 
  }, 
}; 
 
export default resolvers; 
</array<user></code>
</pre></div><p>Our resolver’s only action is to call our getAllUsers function in order to retrieve the actual data. You’ll notice that our getAllUsers resolver is returning an array of User Interfaces. This should be a bit suspicious, but for now let’s just see what happens.&nbsp;</p><p>Now we must implement the getAllUsers function in code. But to make this article simpler and focus on GraphQL we’ll create a function that returns hard coded values. Create a file called dataService.ts and add this code.</p><div><pre><code>
import { v4 } from "uuid"; 
 
export interface Identifiable { 
  id: string; 
} 
 
export interface User extends Identifiable { 
  userName: string; 
} 
 
export interface Rating { 
  stars: number; 
} 
 
export class StandardUser implements User { 
  constructor( 
    public id: string, 
    public userName: string, 
    public stars: number 
  ) {} 
} 
 
export class Moderator implements User { 
  constructor( 
    public id: string, 
    public userName: string, 
    public stars: number, 
    public categories: [Category] 
  ) {} 
} 
 
export class Administrator implements User { 
  constructor(public id: string, public userName: string) {} 
} 
 
export class Category implements Identifiable { 
  constructor(public id: string, public name: string) {} 
} 
 
export function getAllUsers() { 
  const users: Array<user> = []; 
  users.push(new StandardUser(v4(), "dave", 4)); 
  users.push(new Moderator(v4(), "ruth", 5, [new Category(v4(), "Cooking")])); 
  users.push(new StandardUser(v4(), "jane", 5)); 
  users.push(new StandardUser(v4(), "tom", 1)); 
  users.push(new Administrator(v4(), "linda")); 
  users.push( 
    new Moderator(v4(), "tom", 2, [new Category(v4(), "Programming")]) 
  ); 
  users.push(new Administrator(v4(), "betty")); 
 
  return users; 
} 
</user></code>
</pre></div><p>‍</p><p>Our dataService contains all of our TypeScript types that mirror our GraphQL schemas, as well as the getAllUsers function that returns a list of objects that inherit from our User Interface. As you can see, getAllUsers all types of Users, including StandardUsers and Administrators, but since they all implement the User interface (i.e. User is the parent type for all of them), the function’s return type is set as an array of User types. Now let’s try querying it!</p><h3>Querying and Fragments</h3><p>Open your GraphQL playground by opening your browser to the GraphQL server URL, which would be something like http://localhost:&lt;port number&gt;/graphql. Then add this Query as shown.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>
query { 
    getAllUsers { 
  	... on User { 
        id 
        userName 
  	} 
	} 
} 
</code>
</pre></div><p>‍</p><p>This is our Query for getAllUsers, but instead of fields we see three periods. What we’re seeing with the “…” is called an inline Fragment. This tells the GraphQL service which type of data we are looking for. In this case we indicate that we want the Interface User and its fields of id and userName.&nbsp;</p><p>So let’s try and run this Query, but when we do we get this error shown.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-b158e79301e4-f078b551"><p><img alt="Graphical user interface, text, applicationDescription automatically generated" src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5f8f2def7201d623778ea438_PIIAWDJ_AhMP0A-vvcjwUNoHCg_WvzU_ih_MejA2hzeijfi7RI3lHvNq5pXadUM2JbGzIVoT0Ny2XqAveRkYRh7ow7xWHMnBfFIIkg6g0iXm9uHKclOT1FdRUyMomCxlR0xJr80.png"></p><figcaption>Figure 1.6 First query error&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>What does this error mean? If we look back at our definition of GraphQL Interfaces we said they only have declarations, but no implementations. Therefore, we need to replace the interface with an implementation of the interface, the type, that does return data. Let’s see how to do that.&nbsp;</p><p>Update the resolvers variable by adding this code.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>
User: { 
    __resolveType(obj: any, ctx: GqlContext, info: any) { 
      if (obj.categories) { 
        return "Moderator"; 
  	} else if (obj.stars) { 
        return "StandardUser"; 
  	} 
 
      return "Administrator"; 
	}, 
  }, 
</code>
</pre></div><p>By defining the User Interface in our resolvers we are telling GraphQL that when it encounters the User in a Query it should instead return one of the specific types listed. Note, the logic of how to go about determining this is entirely up to you. However an obvious potential way of doing this would be to use member fields unique to each type, as we have done here.&nbsp;</p><p>So now when we run the same Query again we get this.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-2d373c8cffc7-f078b551"><p><img alt="Graphical user interface, text, applicationDescription automatically generated" src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5f8f2defabcf9fda1c9bfe3c_ftxvQYJCQ3OAPpkHSZnuVL7jXMEfunX-V0p_R8ZSuXgZ2rx7WK4QzdCqH_eZJ34YFMjBO9kNz9SXa7ndzlfLx5ryJ9CAzIz7P4q-660SjiLv9BQ8pImbQkcNQtw5-0nk45evL9M.png"></p><figcaption>Figure 1.8 Second query updated attempt&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Clearly this works, but we’re not getting all the related fields and it’s hard to tell which type each returned item is. Let’s update our query a bit to show these details.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-f491df54febb-f078b551"><p><img alt="Graphical user interface, text, applicationDescription automatically generated" src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5f8f2def420f9a0f6c80d8c8_2SHnrjaNjXyK0u6aUR7Hz8ljFO-tgQzGVFWgEpOiM6fdGPwDDLHO06pfgwfzBt53FVEvjGY-cIqhfwt8oO3AqgfyNT2gShd68HhW-XkaXgbZ_pA-ZqG1-S4XklcIbrqENkCmbH4.png"></p><figcaption>Figure 1.9 Updated Query</figcaption></figure><p>If we go over this Query, we can see that by using the __typename field we get back the type name of every item in our result set. So that definitely helps clarify things somewhat. However only the StandardUser type is returning actual fields. The other types are indicated, but their type-specific data is blank! It’s clear what we need to do so let’s take a stab at it.</p><figure id="w-node-56558d760f7a-f078b551"><p><img alt="TextDescription automatically generated" src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5f8f2def278d58389665c636_mXZsK_WO2ymnwnCq5GMq2xctdvRhmQ3JdCo_QBrHR_K2ldFKc5T4cKUkP_eqioXJWYxdqIMN3Dlv5eECYPpgN_rxwzOJRIZLS3Pe18d353X1DuYVtKamXiEoJp1q9DbJmbY37gE.png"></p><figcaption>Figure 1.10 Updated Query with all types&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>As you probably guessed, we needed to add our other types and their specific fields. For example, in the case of Moderator we have a unique field called categories, Since the category is its own type as well, we also specified the “name” member from the type.</p><p>Now we’ve got everything working! Alas, there’s one small issue. Even after implementing such robust types, we’re still repeating the id and userName fields multiple times. In this case, it doesn’t matter much. But for larger data models, it’s quite easy to have dozens of shared fields – imagine specific all those fields repeatedly!</p><p>We’ve already seen how we can use inline …</p></div></div>

Not only do APIs give developers instant access to powerful functionality, but their programmability also makes it easy for developers to integrate disparate pieces of functionality.</p><p>But today, this only applies to <em>documented</em> APIs. This means the company responsible for the API has made a conscious choice to expose the API—and they’ve allocated the resources to creating and maintaining documentation. This also means there are a <em>lot</em> of SaaS APIs out there that could make users’ lives easier, but that haven’t been documented.</p><p>This blog post is about a new feature that my team and I built after I spent a painful couple of days figuring out how to script against Notion. After my experience trying to learn the undocumented Notion API, we decided to automate the process of learning web APIs so that nobody would have to suffer like this again.</p><p>In this blog post, I talk about:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>How I tried to automate against the Notion the hard way.</p></li><li><p>How this led my team at Akita to build a new feature to automatically learn undocumented APIs.</p></li><li><p>How to use Akita to <em>automatically</em> learn APIs, including the Notion API. (See what we learned on SwaggerHub <a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Akita-Software/notion-api-experiment/0.0.1?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">here</a>!)</p></li></ul><p>To anyone who wants to learn an undocumented API–or document your own API so people don’t have to do this—you may be interested in checking out <a href="https://www.akitasoftware.com/get-invite?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">our private beta</a>!<br></p><h2>🐕 First, some background</h2><p>I’m Chris, the product manager at Akita. I joined Akita after eight years at Twilio, where I helped define products like Twilio Marketplace and Twilio Channels. While I was making APIs easier to use at Twilio, I also saw how APIs made software development harder. For instance, the rise of internal and external APIs make it much more difficult to prevent breaking changes. These observations led me to join Akita about a year ago.</p><p>At Akita, we’ve been working to give structure to the interaction graph of APIs, for instance to <a href="https://www.akitasoftware.com/blog/2020/9/22/faster-better-earlier-catch-breaking-changes-by-diffing-api-behavior?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">detect breaking changes in web apps</a>. Akita watches API traffic to automatically generate API specs and infer implicit API contracts. Core to Akita’s approach is diffing API specs and contracts learned across different environments. We’ve been working hard to make this technology easily accessible to developers, no code changes required, in just minutes.</p><h2>💡 An observation about Notion&nbsp;</h2><p>Now for how I came to autogenerate an API spec for Notion.</p><p>As the product manager at a small startup, I spend a lot of time making sure that the right information gets to the right place. Customer feedback, blog posts like this one, product usage, and engineering metrics are just a few of the things I need to track. I also require some sleep, food, and the occasional trip outside. How do I manage to keep up? That’s easy: AUTOMATE ALL THE THINGS!!!</p><p>When I joined Akita, I realized that Notion was what we needed to organize information across the team. But the problems started when we needed to add <em>new</em> information to Notion. For instance, we keep team meeting information in Notion. Most of our team meetings began with “Did someone create a Notion page?” or “Where is the page from last week’s meeting?” The same thing would happen during customer meetings.</p><p>Given how many meetings we have a week, I figured we could get several hours back <em>a week</em> if we could get computers to automate creating the Notion page for us. All we needed was to figure out how to automate Notion.<br></p><h2>😰 Thwarted by the Private API</h2><p>The catch? Notion doesn’t have a publicly documented API.</p><p>The good news is that it’s still possible to use an undocumented API. It’s easy. You could set up a headless browser to automate clicks or turn to that ol’ standby Grease Monkey script for watching your browser traffic. I recently read a blog post where the author ran a proxy and executed a man-in-the-middle attack in order to build a calendar widget for one of his favorite websites.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603217507152_27960"><div><p>Okay, it’s not easy. It took me a couple days of hacking to get a <a href="https://gist.github.com/chriscorcoran/51b2f37a807e6f09cbbf320b63b8931a?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">reasonable solution working</a> the first time. And the undocumented API problem is prevalent among newer SaaS tools, and it makes sense: APIs are hard to build, document, and maintain. If more of these tools had APIs, I would automate more and integrate them more deeply into our workflows.<br></p><h2>⚡️ Using Akita to learn the Notion API</h2><p>I wondered if there was a better way.</p><p>Then I realized: oh wait, I’m working on building a tool that <em>lets you generate API specifications by monitoring network traffic</em>. Surely we could use Akita to build API specs from watching my interactions with Notion?</p><p>But it wasn’t completely straightforward. Up to this point, we had set up Akita with the assumption that the user wants to document their <em>own</em> API, so Akita worked by listening to network traffic through an agent.</p><p>But when I posed this problem to my engineering team, they came up with a solution that let me generate this beautiful rendition of the Notion API spec.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603217507152_67186"><p>This feature was a game-changer! Now that Akita could learn this spec, I had an OpenAPI specification that detailed every endpoint, parameter, and property that the Notion frontend used. And what made this <em>really</em> useful was Akita’s analysis layered on top.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603217507152_72403"><div><p><a href="https://www.akitasoftware.com/blog/2020/9/29/taking-types-to-the-next-level-stop-api-bugs-by-inferring-data-formats?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">Akita Data Formats</a>, detecting precise data formats like unique IDs and specific datetime RFCs,&nbsp; and API Relationships, surfacing which endpoints accept values of the same data type, made it easier to understand how the endpoints worked together.</p><div><p>You can check out the API spec we were able to generate on SwaggerHub <a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Akita-Software/notion-api-experiment/0.0.1?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">here</a>.</p></div><h2>🛠 How it works</h2><p>The secret to this new feature? HAR Files.</p><p>Previously, to run Akita you ran an agent alongside where you hosted a service. The agent would listen to network traffic and allow you to autogenerate API specs without having to make code changes or use a proxy. While this was super easy to use if you were learning your <em>own</em> API, it was less helpful for learning other people’s web APIs. Our new HAR file ingest allows you to learn <em>any web API</em> that relies on AJAX-style requests, <em>using any major web browser,</em> in a matter of minutes.</p><p>HAR Files are a little known feature of the Webkit Developer Console (available in major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge) that allows you to record requests, performance metrics, and other interesting data from a debugging session. It turns out that it’s not so hard to extend Akita to accept HAR files instead of network traffic. HAR files are key to making it easy to autogenerate API specs, without needing headless servers or proxies.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603217507152_160214"><p>Below I show a screen capture of me trying to break this new feature by returning to my old nemesis, Notion.

  <p>I heard a lot lately about using types in Haskell to describe function arguments in more details
(e.g. function takes a list that is non-empty) and thus achieve higher compile-time safety.
It sounded cool so I decided to research more about it and I created this blog post as a memo of
what I learned.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>pretty extensive, but not so intuitive. Still the most complete intro (and pretty much
the only one) to the topic. Most of my examples below are taken from it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-type-level-programming">Why type-level programming?</h2>

<p>As I wrote above, my current understanding is that with it we can add more info into the type
signature of a function, making it “safer” in the compile time.
E.g. instead of just saying <em>“this function takes a list”</em>
we can say <em>“this function takes a non-empty list”</em>, or
<em>“this function takes Int which is &gt; 10 and &lt; 127”</em> (although this last one might be solved just by
creating an appropriate type, e.g. using TH?).</p>

<p>TODO: I would love to learn about more examples where this is used.</p>

<h2 id="example-a-function-that-accepts-only-a-non-empty-list">Example: A function that accepts only a non-empty list</h2>

<p>We want to be able to tell from its type whether a list is empty or not. To do that we will
create a new type which will have that information stored in it.</p>

<p>First, let’s see how we would create a “normal” list type on our own:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span> <span>|</span> <span>Cons</span> <span>a</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>This is a usual recursive definition of list (<code>Cons</code> stands for <em>Constructor</em>). Once there is
an instance of this type we can tell which type of elements the list contains (e.g. <code>List Int</code>
or <code>List (Maybe String)</code>), but nothing more than that. We cannot deduce from its type (which means
in compile time) whether it is empty or not.</p>

<p>We could of course check it in runtime and throw an exception if the list is empty, but we want to
be stricter than that. We want to ensure that program cannot even be compiled if an empty list is
provided where it shouldn’t be.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-we-missing">What are we missing?</h3>

<p>The problem with the “normal” list we defined above is that we are missing information in its type.
We have only one piece of
information and that is type of the elements within the list - we use type parameter <code>a</code> to declare
that. We can also use it to define functions that work only for a specific <code>a</code>. E.g. here is a
function that works only on a list of integers:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>sumListElements</span> <span>::</span> <span>List</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>This is guaranteed in compile-time. If we call this function with a list of e.g. <code>Bool</code>s, the
compiler will throw an error at us.</p>



<p>So here’s an idea - why don’t we just use the same mechanism again (having a type parameter) to
know whether a list is empty or not. If we added another type parameter to keep track of that,
our type (disregarding data constructors for now) would look like this:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>Just as type param <code>a</code> means <em>any type</em> (e.g. <code>Int</code> or <code>MyType</code>), the same applies for <code>empty</code>.
E.g. we could have <code>List Int Double</code> or <code>List String Bool</code> or <code>List Int SomeCustomType</code>.
Just as we restricted function <code>sumListElements</code> above to work only when <code>a</code> is <code>Int</code>, we can use
<code>empty</code> in the same way.</p>

<p>Let’s say we want to implement a safe version of <code>head</code> function - that means it accepts only a
non-empty list as an argument, otherwise it won’t compile. We will call it <code>safeHead</code>.</p>

<p>Ok, we introduced <code>empty</code> as another type parameter, but the question we are facing now is what
do we do with it? Which concrete types will take its place and how?</p>

<p>Lets introduce two new types:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>Empty</span>
<span>data</span> <span>NonEmpty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>The interesting thing here is that we have only type constructors for these types and no data
constructors. That means we cannot create instances (values) of these types, but that is ok!
We need these types only at the type level, in function signatures. Such types are also called
<a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Empty_type"><em>uninhabited</em> or <em>empty</em></a>.</p>

<p>Now let’s imagine we have a way to correctly assign <code>Empty</code> and <code>NonEmpty</code> to empty and non-empty
lists’ types. Then we could define <code>safeHead</code> as follows:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>safeHead</span> <span>::</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>safeHead</span> <span>(</span><span>Cons</span> <span>elem</span> <span>_</span> <span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>elem</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>We wouldn’t even have to define a case for <code>End</code> since the type guarantees it can’t ever happen.</p>

<h3 id="assigning-correct-type-to-empty">Assigning correct type to <code>empty</code></h3>

<p>The main question that is left is how do we produce such lists with an extra type parameter, and
how do we make sure which type <code>empty</code> takes when? This is what we will look at now.</p>

<p>This is how our type <code>List</code> looks once we have added <code>empty</code> as a second type parameter:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span> <span>|</span> <span>Cons</span> <span>a</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>Except adding that extra type parameter, nothing else changed. When I first saw this,
I was confused by
the fact there is a type parameter on the left side that doesn’t appear anywhere on the right side
as a data.
How is that possible, why would that make sense? (Ok, <em>there is</em> <code>empty</code> on the right side here, but
only as a part of a type designation and not as a part of data constructor. Which means there will
never be anything of type <code>empty</code> in some value of this type).</p>

<p>But turns out it does make sense, since we use it as a designation at the type level only, to show
that an
underlying value has a certain property (empty or non-empty in this case). Such types, which have a
type parameter(s) on the left side that don’t appear on the right are
also called <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Phantom_type"><em>phantom types</em></a>.</p>

<p>Let’s see now what happens if we create an instance of our new <code>List</code> and test its type in GHCi:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>&gt;</span> <span>emptyList</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span>
<span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>emptyList</span>
<span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span>

<span>&gt;</span> <span>nonEmptyList</span> <span>=</span> <span>Cons</span> <span>"haskell"</span> <span>End</span>
<span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>nonEmptyList</span>
<span>nonEmptyList</span> <span>::</span> <span>List</span> <span>[</span><span>Char</span><span>]</span> <span>empty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>As we can see, GHCi concluded that <code>a</code> is a string in <code>nonEmptyList</code>, but could not deduce anything
for <code>empty</code> in either case, since it is not used anywhere. So how can we solve that
and make sure that <code>empty</code> becomes <code>Empty</code> for <code>emptyList</code> and <code>NonEmpty</code> for <code>nonEmptyList</code>?</p>

<h3 id="gadts">GADTs</h3>

<p>Before we continue, let’s check types of our data constructors, <code>End</code> and <code>Cons</code> (since they are
functions as well, we can do that):</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>End</span>
<span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span>

<span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>Cons</span>
<span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>We can see they have no power to change or specify <code>empty</code> type param in any way. <code>End</code> will leave
it unspecified, while <code>Cons</code> will preserve it from the input list. Also, we have no way to change
these type signatures as they are automatically derived from <code>List</code> type definition.</p>

<p>This is exactly where GADTs come in. GADTs (<a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/GADT">Generalized Algebraic Data Types</a>) is a Haskell extension that lets us explicitly
define the type signatures of data constructors.</p>

<p>Before seeing GADTs in action, let’s first remind ourselves of the standard,
non-GADT definition of <code>List</code> we used above:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span> <span>|</span> <span>Cons</span> <span>a</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>Now let’s rearrange it a bit and add types of data constructors in comments so we can more easily
reason about them:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>End</span> <span>|</span>                   <span>-- End :: List a empty</span>
    <span>Cons</span> <span>a</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span><span>)</span>   <span>-- Cons :: a -&gt; List a empty -&gt; List a empty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>As we mentioned, the types in the comments are automatically derived and we cannot control them. But
that is exactly what we want to do, and GADTs let us achieve that using the following syntax:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>{-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-}</span>

<span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>End</span> <span>::</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>Empty</span>
    <span>Cons</span> <span>::</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>NonEmpty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>We can see it is very similar to our “rearranged” <code>List</code> definition above! What GADTs let us do
is write by ourselves types of data constructors (which were in the previous definition in the
comments), giving us control to specify them as we wish!</p>

<p>The difference in the syntax is that we have to add <code>where</code> after the type name and then
for each data constructor we specify its type signature.</p>

<p>Now we finally have the power to control <code>empty</code> type parameter (in <code>List a empty</code>)! We specified
that <code>End</code> will mark list as <code>Empty</code>, while <code>Cons</code> will mark it as <code>NonEmpty</code>. And this is exactly
what we wanted to do, because if we used <code>End</code> we know the list is empty, while if we used <code>Cons</code>
we know there is at least one element in it, which makes it non-empty.</p>

<p>Let’s see it in action! Using it stays the same as without GADTs, just that this time there will
be <code>empty</code> type param which assumes an appropriate type:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>End</span>
<span>End</span> <span>::</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>Empty</span>

<span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>(</span><span>Cons</span> <span>5</span> <span>End</span><span>)</span>
<span>Cons</span> <span>5</span> <span>End</span> <span>::</span> <span>Num</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>NonEmpty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>Wohoo, this works now! We see we can construct values of this type and we will always know whether
it is empty or not. <code>safeHead</code> function we defined above will work on these without any problems.</p>

<h3 id="can-we-just-use-smart-constructors-instead-of-gadts">Can we just use smart constructors instead of GADTs?</h3>

<p>One possible “downside” of GADTs is that it is a language extension we have to enable, thus making
our codebase a bit heavier (longer compilation time?) and less “standard”.</p>

<p>Sometimes we can avoid using GADTs with smart constructors. Let’s see what that is and how it would
work in this case.</p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Smart_constructors">Smart constructor</a> is simply a function that is used
to create a certain value instead of using its
data constructor directly. We typically do that (hide data constructors and expose smart
constructor functions) when we want to have extra control over the value creation. E.g. we want to
make some extra checks, or make sure an invalid value isn’t provided etc.</p>

<p>For example, we could provide a following smart constructor to create an empty list:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>Empty</span>
<span>data</span> <span>NonEmpty</span>

<span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span> <span>|</span> <span>Cons</span> <span>a</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span><span>)</span>

<span>createEmptyList</span> <span>::</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>Empty</span>
<span>createEmptyList</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>And this works! By defining the type signature of <code>createEmptyList</code> we made sure that <code>empty</code> will
always assume the type of <code>Empty</code> when this function is called. Since <code>End</code> has a type signature
<code>End :: List a empty</code>, we just “casted” type param <code>empty</code> here into a specific type.</p>

<p>Let’s try to do the same for the other data constructor, adding an element to the list:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>Empty</span>
<span>data</span> <span>NonEmpty</span>

<span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span> <span>|</span> <span>Cons</span> <span>a</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span><span>)</span>

<span>addElemToList</span> <span>::</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>NonEmpty</span>
<span>add…</span></code></pre></figure></article></div></div>

On the one hand, they've been denying it. On the others, on the other hand, they said it would be a bonus.</p>  <p>They said that come fall, and the second wave, we will be much better protected than our Scandinavian neighbours who had 10 times less deaths than we did in relation to population. But it became very clear once broad testing of antibodies was being done that there was nothing close to herd immunity.</p>  <p>And so, of course, they realize that they can't go for herd immunity. It's going to kill too many people. I mean, it's already killed almost 6,000 people in a population of 10 million. So they are no longer going for herd immunity, which doesn't mean that they're prepared to say, "we were wrong and we're going to change our recommendations."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768040.1603128896!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/health-coronavirus-sweden.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768040.1603128896!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/health-coronavirus-sweden.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768040.1603128896!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/health-coronavirus-sweden.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768040.1603128896!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/health-coronavirus-sweden.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768040.1603128896!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/health-coronavirus-sweden.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768040.1603128896!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/health-coronavirus-sweden.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>Anders Tegnell of the Public Health Agency of Sweden attends a news conference updating the country about COVID-19 on Oct. 9.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Claudio Bresciani/TT News Agency/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><strong>At the centre of all of this, as we have followed what's going on in Sweden, is a man named </strong><strong>Anders&nbsp;Tegnel, Sweden's chief epidemiologist, and he seems to be a bit of a rock star in your country for the decisions he made. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-tegnell-tattoo-idUSKCN2292G7">People have tattoos of him on their bodies.</a> So why is he so popular?</strong></p>  <p>This is a combination of factors, and this deserves a long discussion. Part of it, I'm sure, is that when there's a national crisis, people want to believe in authority.</p>  <p>The other aspect is that he has a very calming demeanour. Even when the numbers were going through the roof, he kept saying that we're flattening out, we're hitting the peak. He had a way of sounding extremely calming.</p>  <p>And also, you know, 90 per cent of the deaths were in the elderly, so …&nbsp;most people didn't see it.</p>  <p><strong>And what do you think of&nbsp;Anders&nbsp;Tegnel?</strong></p>  <p>I have no opinions about him personally, but I think he has not handled this well and he keeps on not handling this well.</p>  <p>Just as an example, Sweden is [one of the only countries],&nbsp;together with Somalia, Yemen, Eritrea, Syria, Greenland and some Pacific islands, who have still no recommendations for face masks whatsoever. So, you know, he hates face masks. He says they don't help. He keeps saying there's no support for them.</p>  <p>In the spring, that could have been a fair assumption. But by now, there's the studies are overwhelmingly showing the benefit of face masks, especially when it's used in the whole population, because it protects against someone who is sick.</p>  <p>So if everybody wears it, face masks are extremely efficient. But if only 50 per cent wear it, it's not at all sufficient. But he will not even say that they're good. I mean, you have to understand, in the Swedish hospitals, the doctors and nurses do not wear face masks.</p>    <p><strong>Well, it seems that [U.S. President] Donald Trump and the people around him would agree with Anders&nbsp;Tegnel.&nbsp;But the rest of the world, at least in countries where they have policies, they are not doing that. So somebody is right and somebody is wrong.</strong></p>  <p>The interesting thing is that in Sweden, we have a social democratic government dominated by the Social Democrats, so …&nbsp;it's more of a left-wing policy. Whereas in the rest of the world, it's very much a right-wing <em>laissez faire</em> policy to have herd immunity, or to try to have herd immunity, or to not wear face masks. Freedom, you know?</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768036.1603128765!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/health-coronavirus-sweden-cases.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768036.1603128765!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/health-coronavirus-sweden-cases.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768036.1603128765!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/health-coronavirus-sweden-cases.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768036.1603128765!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/health-coronavirus-sweden-cases.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768036.1603128765!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/health-coronavirus-sweden-cases.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768036.1603128765!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/health-coronavirus-sweden-cases.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>A sign promoting physical distancing is pictured in the Gallerian in Stockholm, Sweden, May 12.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Henrik Montgomery/TT News Agency/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><strong>There was <a href="https://time.com/5899432/sweden-coronovirus-disaster/">a freedom of information [request</a>, and] a bunch of emails that have been published by journalists in your country that show that Mr. Tegnel said that at one point that when it was suggested that 10 per cent of those who would get the disease would be the elderly and maybe they would die, 10 per cent might be "worth it," he apparently said. How much of the decisions are being driven by this idea that, well, maybe we have to keep Sweden moving, keeping the businesses open, and that's part of the motivation?</strong></p>  <p>They will never admit that the economy is an aspect. By the way, Sweden's economy has not fared any better than its Nordic neighbours. Rather, it's more at the bottom than at the top among our neighbours. So it hasn't benefited from it, and it has certainly not benefited from the herd immunity.</p>  <p><strong>Today we saw the announcement that citizens in Sweden should avoid places like shopping malls, museums, gyms, concerts, and avoid public transportation or visiting the elderly. So is there a shift perhaps in perception?</strong></p>  <p>There are policies. You know, it's not a completely<em> laissez faire</em>. I mean, people are advised to stay to work from home if they can. People are advised to not fill up the public transportation, the busses and the subways. There is still a maximum amount of people gathering of 50.</p>  <p>It's not a complete "let's live as normal" — but it's all recommendations and advice.</p>  <p>I would say that incrementally, Sweden has has gotten closer to other countries. I mean, we do a lot of testing now. We do, you know, about as much as Canada per capita. So it's not like in the spring, where nobody was tested outside of the hospital.</p>  <p>But it still is always too little.</p>  <hr>  <p><em>Written by Sheena Goodyear.

<![CDATA[Retool Funding Lesson: You Can Compete with Free When It's B2B]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	<p>Retool has announced that it raised $50M from Sequoia only 2 years after launch for what is essentially a front-end builder. While explaining to a non-developer friend how you can build a business selling something that countless web developers can cobble together out of free open source components, I accidentally busted this rhyme:</p>

<p>You can compete with free,
when it comes to B2B,
because for businesses
no-charge isn’t free</p>

<p>Look at it from a business’s point of view. Let’s say they pay a web developer $100 / hour. If it takes that dev 10 hours to piece together a front end from React, Bootstrap, and several tends of thousands of Javascript packages, that app cost them $1000. The fact that they don’t pay for the open source components is irrelevant.</p>

<p>Now imagine they could get the same app with 2 hours of effort using a tool that costs $100 / month. That $100 tool ends up costing them $-700. Paying up starts to sound like a pretty good deal</p>

<p>There are lots of examples of this economic story playing out if you look for them. Any development team can replicate the essential elements of Algolia with Apache Solr or Elasticsearch, but Algolia is going strong. Open source CMS options abound, but Contentful raised an $80M series E recently.</p>

<p>The big caveat here is that this <em>does not</em> apply in the B2C world. Consumers are famously blind to total cost of ownership, both monetary and intangible (like giving up any semblance of privacy for a ‘free’ navigation app). Free really is nigh on impossible to beat when you are targeting consumers. And the false economy of cheap-but-fragile junk is so compelling that finding <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife">things that won’t break in a couple of years is an armchair sport</a>.</p>

<p>Next time your trying to think of a business idea, ask yourself this question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are businesses dependent on that they aren’t paying for directly but they are paying dearly for in employee hours?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whatever answer you come up with, it’s a million dollar idea.</p>

October 20, 2020 | https://jet-start.sh/blog/2020/10/06/enabling-full-text-search | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jet-start.sh/blog/2020/10/06/enabling-full-text-search">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>In this post, we will take a legacy application and improve its search
functionality. We will do this with only a few changes to the
application itself. Using a technique called change data capture (CDC)
we will listen for changes in a database and react to these
changes&nbsp;- write to a search index case. Before writing to the
search index, we will also enrich the data with a natural language
processing (NLP) step that extracts keywords from a text description.</p>
<p>We might want to use an external search index for various reasons,
especially:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>to provide more feature-rich functionality than full-text search in a
relational database;</p></li>
<li><p>to scale the search independently of the database;</p></li>
<li><p>to add more functionality (keyword extraction) to the application
without
modifying it - making changes to a legacy application is sometimes
risky, or time-consuming, so taking this approach might be faster,
therefore cheaper.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this tutorial we will do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use Hazelcast Jet - an open-source stream processing system - and its CDC
module to read changes made to the application database for further
processing in a Jet pipeline.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Jet pipeline, we will enrich the data with an NLP mapping step.</p></li>
<li><p>Write the results to an Elasticsearch index, using an Elasticsearch
connector, <a href="https://jet-start.sh/blog/2020/07/14/jet-42-is-released">released in Jet 4.2</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://jet-start.sh/blog/assets/2020-10-06-architecture.png" alt="Architecture"></p>
<h2>The Application</h2>
<p>We chose the <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic">Spring
PetClinic</a>
application. It is relatively well-known to many Java developers and is
rather similar to a typical enterprise application.</p>
<p>The application provides a management tool for managing pets, their
owners, and visits to vets. It allows searching for owners, but only
using the owner’s last name. We will make the search more feature-rich,
allowing us to search on first name, last name, pet names and keywords
extracted from descriptions of the visits.</p>
<p>First, let’s start a vanilla version of the application. Run the
following command to start MySQL database inside a Docker container, we
use the official MySQL image, which allows us to create a database for
the pet clinic application easily:</p>
<pre><code>docker run --name petclinic-mysql -it \
  -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic \
  -e MYSQL_USER=petclinic \
  -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=petclinic \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysql \
  -p 3306:3306 mysql
</code></pre>
<p>Clone the pet clinic application source code from
<a href="https://github.com/hazelcast-demos/spring-petclinic">Github</a> (this is a
fork of the official <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic">Spring PetClinic
repository</a> with a
branch containing the changes we will make later for your convenience).</p>
<pre><code>git <span>clone</span> https://github.com/hazelcast-demos/spring-petclinic.git
</code></pre>
<p>Start the pet clinic application from the command line by running the
following command:</p>
<pre><code><span>cd</span> spring-petclinic
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=mysql
</code></pre>
<p>And wait for the following log message:</p>
<pre><code>2020-09-30 16:17:04.113  INFO 24847 --- [  restartedMain] o.s.s.petclinic.PetClinicApplication     : Started PetClinicApplication in 3.177 seconds (JVM running for 3.5)
</code></pre>
<p>Navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a></p>
<p>-&gt; Click Find Owners in top-level menu</p>
<p>-&gt; Click Find Owner button to list all data</p>
<p>and you should see a screen similar to the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://jet-start.sh/blog/assets/2020-10-06-spring-petclinic-list.png" alt="Spring PetClinic Sample Application"></p>
<h2>Prepare for Change Data Capture</h2>
<p>In order to stream the changes from the MySQL database we need to modify
certain settings and grant more permissions to the <code>petclinic</code> user.</p>
<p>Run the following command to start MySQL client, enter the <code>mysql</code>
password for the root user:</p>
<pre><code>docker run -it --rm --link petclinic-mysql:petclinic-mysql mysql mysql -hpetclinic-mysql -uroot -p
</code></pre>
<p>Run the following to grant privileges to the <code>petclinic</code> user to allow
listening to the database changes:</p>
<pre><code><span>ALTER</span> <span>USER</span> petclinic <span>IDENTIFIED</span> <span>WITH</span> mysql_native_password <span>BY</span> <span>'petclinic'</span>;
<span>GRANT</span> RELOAD <span>ON</span> *.* <span>TO</span> <span>'petclinic'</span>;
<span>GRANT</span> <span>REPLICATION</span> <span>CLIENT</span> <span>ON</span> *.* <span>TO</span> <span>'petclinic'</span>;
<span>GRANT</span> <span>REPLICATION</span> <span>SLAVE</span> <span>ON</span> *.* <span>TO</span> <span>'petclinic'</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>ALTER USER</code> command changes the default authentication method to
one supported by the Jet CDC connector. The <code>GRANT</code> commands allow the
petclinic user to stream changes from the database in the same way as
during master-slave replication.</p>
<h2>Start Elasticsearch</h2>
<p>We want to enable full-text search across multiple fields, but not all
fields. With Elasticseach we need to create an index mapping that
copies fields into a single field, the field is then used for searching.</p>
<p>Run the following command to start Elasticsearch inside a docker
container:</p>
<pre><code>docker run --name petclinic-elastic \
  -e discovery.type=single-node \
  -e cluster.routing.allocation.disk.threshold_enabled=<span>false</span> \
  -p9200:9200 elasticsearch:7.9.2
</code></pre>
<p>Create an Elasticsearch index mapping by running the following command:</p>
<pre><code>curl -XPUT -H <span>"Content-type: application/json"</span> -d <span>'
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "first_name": {
        "type": "text",
        "copy_to": "search"
      },
      "last_name": {
        "type": "text",
        "copy_to": "search"
      },
      "pets.name": {
        "type": "text",
        "copy_to": "search"
      },
      "pets.visits.keywords": {
        "type": "text",
        "copy_to": "search"
      },
      "search": {
        "type": "text"
      }
    }
  }
}'</span> http://localhost:9200/petclinic-index
</code></pre>
<p>The default setting of Elasticsearch analyzer is suitable for us. For
more elaborate configuration of the text analysis, you should look into
the Elasticsearch documentation or some other source.</p>
<h2>Hazelcast Jet Job</h2>
<p>Now that we have the Petclinic and Elastic set-up and working, we can
start the data pump - a Jet job reading change events from MySQL
database and writing into the Elastic index.</p>
<p>A Jet job is a pipeline of steps that read, modify, aggregate or store
data items. The job definition is written in Java and packaged as a jar
file. The jar file is deployed to a Jet cluster, which takes care of the
execution, scaling, fail-over and other operational aspects.</p>
<p>The job consists of 4 main parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>CDC Source connecting to MySQL database</p></li>
<li><p>A mapping step running the keyword extraction</p></li>
<li><p>A joining step reconstructing the document from change records from</p></li>
<li><p>different tables</p></li>
<li><p>Elasticsearch sink</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>CDC Source</h3>
<p>The configuration of the source is straightforward, just set the required
parameters:</p>
<pre><code><span>StreamSource</span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>ChangeRecord</span><span>&gt;</span></span> source <span>=</span> <span>MySqlCdcSources</span>
    <span>.</span><span>mysql</span><span>(</span><span>"mysql"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setDatabaseAddress</span><span>(</span>databaseAddress<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setDatabasePort</span><span>(</span>databasePort<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setDatabaseUser</span><span>(</span>databaseUser<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setDatabasePassword</span><span>(</span>databasePassword<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setClusterName</span><span>(</span>clusterName<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setDatabaseWhitelist</span><span>(</span><span>"petclinic"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setTableWhitelist</span><span>(</span><span>"petclinic.owners"</span><span>,</span> <span>"petclinic.pets"</span><span>,</span> <span>"petclinic.visits"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Use the source to read change events from MySQL into the pipeline:</p>
<pre><code><span>Pipeline</span> p <span>=</span> <span>Pipeline</span><span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>StreamStage</span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>ChangeRecord</span><span>&gt;</span></span> allRecords <span>=</span> p<span>.</span><span>readFrom</span><span>(</span>mysqlSource<span>)</span>
                                        <span>.</span><span>withoutTimestamps</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
<h3>Keyword extraction</h3>
<p>The next step in the pipeline is to extract the keywords from the visit
description. We will use Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE)
algorithm, the implementation we use was originally published on
<a href="https://github.com/Linguistic/rake">Github</a>. The implementation is not
important for the demonstration, you could use any other Java library,
call a 3rd party service, e.g. via <a href="https://jet-start.sh/docs/how-tos/grpc">grpc</a> or use our
<a href="https://jet-start.sh/docs/tutorials/python">python integration</a>.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>ServiceFactory</span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>?</span><span>,</span> <span>Rake</span><span>&gt;</span></span> keywordService <span>=</span> <span>ServiceFactories</span><span>.</span><span>sharedService</span><span>(</span><span>(</span>context<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>new</span> <span>Rake</span><span>(</span><span>"en"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

p<span>.</span><span>readFrom</span><span>(</span>mysqlSource<span>)</span>
 <span>.</span><span>withoutTimestamps</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
 <span>.</span><span>mapUsingService</span><span>(</span>keywordService<span>,</span> <span>PetClinicIndexJob</span><span>::</span><span>enrichWithKeywords</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The method <code>enrichWithKeywords</code> simply passes the description field from
the change record to the keyword extraction service and sets the results
into the keywords field of the Visit instance.</p>
<p>It is a common pattern to enrich an item in a pipeline with more
information.  Hazelcast Jet works with POJOs in the pipeline, so you
need to somehow compose the original item and the enriching information.
One option is to use tuples.  This works for a small number of fields.
Another option would be to use a domain-specific object holding all the
information - e.g. the <code>keywords</code> field.  If you are on Java 14 or
newer, you might want to give the <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/359">Records preview
feature</a> a try.</p>
<h3>Joining</h3>
<p>Change data capture sends changes to the database as individual records
(represented by
<a href="https://jet-start.sh/javadoc/4.2/com/hazelcast/jet/cdc/ChangeRecord.html">ChangeRecord</a>).
Each record represents a changed row in a database table. If a single
row is all that you need, you are good to go. You can see such example
in our <a href="https://jet-start.sh/blog/2020/07/16/designing-evergreen-cache-cdc">Evergreen Cache blog
post</a>.  But having a
single row to work with is not always the case - often you need to
aggregate either multiple records from the same table or join records
from different tables into a single aggregate record.</p>
<p>In our case, we need to join 3 tables into a single document, which we
then index into Elasticsearch. To perform the joining we will use
<code>mapStateful</code> step. This can be performed either globally or partitioned
on a grouping key. If all your records share a common key it is always a
good idea to do the grouping by the key, because the mapping state is
then evenly distributed across all nodes and the mapping operation
parallelized.</p>
<p>Our visit record contains the pet ID but not the owner ID, in such case,
so we don’t have a single grouping key for all records. There are two
options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>perform the stateful mapping globally, which has the advantage of
having a single state - the joining logic is simpler and the pipeline
more straightforward. The obvious disadvantage is that such a solution
is not scalable because the state may not fit onto a single member and
must be performed by a single thread;</p></li>
<li><p>create two separate mapping steps - one grouped on the owner ID and
the other on the pet ID. This is a trade-off between simplicity and
scalability.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are several observations which hold for both implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the mapping state must cover all data from the beginning, unless there
is a domain-specific rule that would allow eviction of old items;</p></li>
<li><p>the records might arrive in any order, even if there is a foreign key
between the records in the database, the order is not guaranteed, this
is a property of CDC.</p></li>
<li><p>once the object is emitted from the join step, it must not be
modified, otherwise the later stages might see it in inconsistent
state, causing issues which are hard …</p></li></ul></span></p></div></div></div>

What is your background? what is your current position?</h2><p id="b291">Iâ€™ve always been interested in systems programming, and after obtaining my CS degree I got the opportunity to start a PhD at Ghent University, Belgium, right when Julia was first released around 2012. The language seemed intriguing, and since I wanted to gain some experience with LLVM, I decided to port some image processing research code from MATLAB and C++ to Julia. The goal was to match performance of the C++ version, but some of its kernels were implemented in CUDA Câ€¦ So obviously Julia needed a GPU back-end!</p><p id="7f14">That was easier said than done, of course, and much of my PhD was about implementing that back-end and (re)structuring the existing Julia compiler to facilitate these additional back-ends. Nowadays Iâ€™m at Julia Computing, where I still work on everything GPU-related.</p><h2 id="8f7f">What is JuliaGPU? What is the goal of the project?</h2><p id="43d9">JuliaGPU is the name we use to group GPU-related resources in Julia: Thereâ€™s a <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU" rel="noopener">GitHub organization</a> where most packages are hosted, a <a href="https://juliagpu.org/" rel="noopener">website</a> to point the way for new users, we have <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU/gitlab-ci" rel="noopener">CI infrastructure</a> for JuliaGPU projects, thereâ€™s a Slack channel and Discourse category, etc.</p><p id="ceaa">The goal of all this is to make it easier to use GPUs for all kinds of users. Current technologies often impose significant barriers to entry: CUDA is fairly tricky to install, C and C++ are not familiar to many users, etc. With the software we develop as part of the JuliaGPU organization, we aim to make it easy to use GPUs, without hindering the ability to optimize or use low-level features that the hardware has to offer.</p><h2 id="5da7">What is GPU computing? How important is it nowadays?</h2><p id="4de0">GPU computing means using the GPU, a device originally designed for graphics processing, to perform general-purpose computations. It has grown more important now that CPU performance is not improving as steadily as it used to. Instead, specialized devices like GPUs or FPGAs are increasingly used to improve the performance of certain computations. In the case of GPUs, the architecture is a great fit to perform highly-parallel applications. Machine learning networks are a good example of such parallel applications, and their popularity is one of the reasons GPUs have become so important.</p><h2 id="f596">Do you think Julia is an appropriate language to efficiently use GPU capabilities? Why?</h2><p id="775f">Juliaâ€™s main advantage is that the language was designed to be compiled. Even though the syntax is high-level, the generated machine code is<br>compact and has great performance characteristics (for more details, see <a href="http://janvitek.org/pubs/oopsla18b.pdf" rel="noopener">this paper</a>). This is crucial for GPU execution, where we are required to run native binaries and cannot easily (or efficiently) interpret code as is often required by other languageâ€™s semantics.</p><p id="b90b">Because weâ€™re able to directly compile Julia for GPUs, we can use almost all of the languageâ€™s features to build powerful abstractions. For example, you can define your own types, use those in GPU arrays, compose that with existing abstractions like lazy "Transpose" wrappers, access those on the GPU while benefiting from automatic bounds-checking (if needed), etc.</p><h2 id="824e">From a Python programmer perspective, how does CUDA.jl compare to PyCUDA? Are their functionalities equivalent?</h2><p id="cf3f">PyCUDA gives the programmer access to the CUDA APIs, with high-level Python functions that are much easier to use. CUDA.jl provides the same, but in Julia. The `hello world` from PyCUDAâ€™s home page looks almost identical in Julia:</p><pre><span id="a986">using CUDA</span><span id="03e4">function multiply_them(dest, a, b)<br> i = threadIdx().x<br> dest[i] = a[i] * b[i]<br> return<br>end</span><span id="9e7d">a = CuArray(randn(Float32, 400))<br>b = CuArray(randn(Float32, 400))</span><span id="5833">dest = similar(a)<br>@cuda threads=400 multiply_them(dest, a, b)</span><span id="1372">println(dest-a.*b)</span></pre><p id="396f">Thereâ€™s one very big difference: "multiply_them" here is a function written in Julia, whereas PyCUDA uses a kernel written in CUDA C. The reason is straightforward: Python is not simple to compile. Of course, projects like Numba prove that it is very much possible to do so, but in the end those are separate compilers that try to match the reference Python compilers as closely as possible. With CUDA.jl, we integrate with that reference compiler, so itâ€™s much easier to guarantee consistent semantics and follow suit when the language changes (for more details,<br>refer to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03112" rel="noopener">this paper</a>).</p><h2 id="5cf6">Are the packages in the JuliaGPU organization targeted to experienced programmers only?</h2><p id="6590">Not at all. CUDA.jl targets different kinds of (GPU) programmers. If you are confident writing your own kernels, you can do so, while using all of the low-level features CUDA GPUs have to offer. But if you are new to the world of GPU programming, you can use high-level array operations that use existing kernels in CUDA.jl. For example, the above element-wise multiplication could just as well be written as:</p><pre><span id="9c1f">using CUDA</span><span id="476a">a = CuArray(randn(Float32, 400))<br>b = CuArray(randn(Float32, 400))</span><span id="efdf">dest = a .* b</span></pre><h2 id="4c26">Is it necessary to know how to code in CUDA.jl to take full advantage of GPU computing in Julia?</h2><p id="208b">Not for most users. Julia has a powerful language of generic array operations ("map", "reduce", "broadcast", "accumulate", etc) which can be applied to all kinds of arrays, including GPU arrays. That means you can often re-use your codebase developed for the CPU with CUDA.jl (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965997818310123" rel="noopener">this paper</a> shows some powerful examples). Doing so often requires minimal changes: changing the array type, making sure you use array operations instead of for loops, etc.</p><p id="672d">Itâ€™s possible you need to go beyond this style of programming, e.g., because your application doesnâ€™t map cleanly onto array operations, to use specific GPU features, etc. In that case, some basic knowledge about CUDA and the GPU programming model is sufficient to write kernels in CUDA.jl.</p><h2 id="1a33">How is the experience of coding a kernel in CUDA.jl in comparison to CUDA C and how transferable is the knowledge to one another?</h2><p id="6a08">Itâ€™s very similar, and thatâ€™s by design: We try to keep the kernel abstractions in CUDA.jl close to their CUDA C counterparts such that the programming environment is familiar to existing GPU programmers. Of course, by using a high-level source language thereâ€™s many quality-of-life improvements. You can allocated shared memory, for example, statically and dynamically as in CUDA C, but instead of a raw pointers we use an N-dimensional array object you can easily index. An example from the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/using-shared-memory-cuda-cc/" rel="noopener">NVIDIA developer blog</a>:</p><pre><span id="ef8a">__global__ void staticReverse(int *d, int n)<br>{<br> __shared__ int s[64];<br> int t = threadIdx.x;<br> int tr = n-t-1;<br> s[t] = d[t];<br> __syncthreads();<br> d[t] = s[tr];<br>}</span></pre><p id="9cb0">The CUDA.jl equivalent of this kernel looks very familiar, but uses array objects instead of raw pointers:</p><pre><span id="996c">function staticReverse(d)<br> s = @cuStaticSharedMem(Int, 64)<br> t = threadIdx().x<br> tr = length(d)-t+1<br> s[t] = d[t]<br> sync_threads()<br> d[t] = s[tr]<br> return<br>end</span></pre><p id="9a14">Using array objects has many advantages, e.g. multi-dimensional is greatly simplified and we can just do "d[i,j]". But itâ€™s also safer, because these accesses are bounds checked:</p><pre><span id="3d65">julia&gt; a = CuArray(1:64)<br>64-element CuArray{Int64,1}:<br> 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> â‹®<br> 62<br> 63<br> 64</span><span id="0d9c">julia&gt; @cuda threads=65 staticReverse(a)<br>ERROR: a exception was thrown during kernel execution.<br>Stacktrace:<br> [1] throw_boundserror at abstractarray.jl:541</span></pre><p id="c17a">Bounds checking isnâ€™t free, of course, and once weâ€™re certain our code is correct we can add an "@inbounds" annotation to our kernel and get the high-performance code we expect:</p><pre><span id="6846">julia&gt; @device_code_ptx @cuda threads=64 staticReverse(a)<br>.visible .entry staticReverse(.param .align 8 .b8 d[16]) {<br> .reg .b32 %r&lt;2&gt;;<br> .reg .b64 %rd&lt;15&gt;;<br> .shared .align 32 .b8 s[512];</span><span id="09c9">mov.b64 %rd1, d;<br> ld.param.u64 %rd2, [%rd1];<br> ld.param.u64 %rd3, [%rd1+8];<br> mov.u32 %r1, %tid.x;<br> cvt.u64.u32 %rd4, %r1;<br> mul.wide.u32 %rd5, %r1, 8;<br> add.s64 %rd6, %rd5, -8;<br> add.s64 %rd7, %rd3, %rd6;<br> ld.global.u64 %rd8, [%rd7+8];<br> mov.u64 %rd9, s;<br> add.s64 %rd10, %rd9, %rd6;<br> st.shared.u64 [%rd10+8], %rd8;<br> bar.sync 0;<br> sub.s64 %rd11, %rd2, %rd4;<br> shl.b64 %rd12, %rd11, 3;<br> add.s64 %rd13, %rd9, %rd12;<br> ld.shared.u64 %rd14, [%rd13+-8];<br> st.global.u64 [%rd7+8], %rd14;<br> ret;<br>}</span><span id="4489">julia&gt; a<br>64-element CuArray{Int64,1}:<br> 64<br> 63<br> 62<br> â‹®<br> 3<br> 2<br> 1</span></pre><p id="3cee">Tools like "@device_code_ptx" make it easy for an experienced developer to inspect generated code and ensure the compiler does what he wants.</p><h2 id="164a">Why does having a compiler have such an impact in libraries like CUDA.jl? (How was the process of integrating it to the Julia compiler?)</h2><p id="e360">Because we have a compiler at our disposal, we can rely on higher-order functions and other generic abstractions that specialize based on the arguments that users provide. That greatly simplifies our library, but also gives the user very powerful tools. As an example, we have carefully implemented a `mapreduce` function that uses shared memory, warp intrinsics, etc to perform a high-performance reduction. The implementation is generic though, and will automatically re-specialize (even at run time) based on the arguments to the function:</p><pre><span id="9da7">julia&gt; mapreduce(identity, +, CuArray([1,2,3]))<br>6</span><span id="c680">julia&gt; mapreduce(sin, *, CuArray([1.1,2.2,3.3]))<br>-0.11366175839582586</span></pre><p id="52e8">With this powerful `mapreduce` …</p></div></div></section></div>

<h2><strong>A waterfall of old-schoolness&nbsp;</strong></h2>







<p>I worked as a developer using Waterfall for exactly 9 months. I was 22 years old and it was my first programmer job and first corporate environment. This place was old school. Like suit-wearing, personal cubicle type old school. Our CEO would hold all-hands meetings where everyone was required to stand the whole time and he would call people up to give speeches at random because he believed everyone should be good at public speaking.&nbsp;</p>

<figcaption>22 year old Dan was NOT good at public speaking 🙂&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>







<p>At one offsite event, the CEO designated me as the company Complaint Manager. During the 4-day event employees were directed to give me their complaints. Of course my friends dropped anonymous and hilarious complaints because they knew that, at the end of each day, I was going to be called up to the stage to repeat back all of the complaints. What?!? Super old school.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One time, I was sent to work at a client’s office for a week, just so they could visibility see my team working on their project. And I mean that in the most literal sense. We didn’t have any meetings or recent project updates, they just wanted to make sure we were actually working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I never saw a single line of my code in production during my 9 months I spent working there. I actually remember learning that my project was finally being sent to QA for testing the week I left. After 9 months. Old. School.</p>



<p>But I didn’t know any better at the time. I hadn’t heard of Agile yet, and no one told me we were doing Waterfall. Luckily I got out of there and found a job at Cloudlock where I learned about Agile and eventually worked my way up to VP of Engineering. But I’ll never forget my first year as a Waterfall programmer.</p>



<p>So does methodology matter? Absolutely. But…&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>We do agile… But</strong></h2>







<p>If you ask a software developer&nbsp; what methodology they follow, 95% of us will say we do agile…but, usually followed by some version of Scrum or Kanban. While this sounds like a worldwide consensus, the reality is that every dev team I’ve worked on or managed has had a different development process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During my time as VP of Engineering at Cloudlock, I looked after 75 developers across 5 teams. Each team had their own unique process. There were team leads who had been working in software development for 25+ years and others that had <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/promoted-from-dev-to-team-lead-8-things-they-didnt-tell-me/">just gotten promoted</a>. The younger leads liked having a more strict process to follow, whereas the more senior managers had a process they had customized over the years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of those teams built amazing software even though their methods differed per team. Why? Because software development is not a zero sum game. Just because one team is successful using Agile Scrum doesn’t mean another team will be less successful using Agile Kanban. Or Scrumban. Or SAFe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a lot of options out there so, instead of focusing on methodology, I find it makes sense to start with what you’re trying to do and work backwards.&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>A bespoke development process – The GigSmart dev team&nbsp;</strong></h2>







<p><em>“You got rid of teams?!?”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>I recently caught up with my friend Chris Downard, VP of Engineering at GigSmart, to chat about dev methodology changes in light of current events. I was completely taken aback when the first thing he said to me was that he just got rid of teams in his engineering department.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><picture>

<img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-Blog-Methodology-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-Blog-Methodology-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-Blog-Methodology-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-Blog-Methodology-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-Blog-Methodology.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px">
</picture>
</figure>







<p>I’m not personally strict about following this or that development method, but getting rid of teams felt a little extreme.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chris: “It naturally evolved that way. Because of this remote culture that we adopted very rapidly, we just found that the back end people tended to support each other on their backend tickets; whether or not it was on their direct team or a direct feature they were working on. They were helping each other, committing to each other’s code, etc. So we kept the team thing going up until last month, and we were measuring that way, so we just eliminated it because it didn’t make sense anymore.”</p>



<p>Getting rid of teams works for Chris for two reasons. He runs a small-ish team of 14 developers and the team uses a Kanban style framework. If there are 3 or 4 features in flight, each team member is assigned to one as their dominant project, but they’re all on one team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of the classic Scrum ceremonies are still followed, but he’s working on making them more effective as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We do one large standup and it takes us 15 minutes to get through. People give their standup updates in order based on their dominant feature. So the first set of people who go, are the ones who are working on Feature A, and the second group that goes are all working on Feature B.”</p>



<p>On top of no teams and restructuring their daily, Chris says they work in sprints but use a Kanban board to increase speed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The product team loves that because if they decide that something is suddenly really hot because sales has run into this or that, we can address it immediately.”</p>

<h3><strong>Why does GigSmart work this way?&nbsp;</strong></h3>







<ul><li>Chris believes in continuous improvement based on team feedback.</li></ul>







<p>When he runs sprint retros, anything that engineering brings up that isn’t working, they have a conversation about. He brings in product and they chat about ways to make it better, and then they test it. And if it doesn’t work, he readjusts, and tries to fix it. Since he started at GigSmart, there hasn’t been a 4 week period where their process has stayed the same.&nbsp;</p>







<ul start="2"><li>GigSmart’s most valuable outcome is speed.</li></ul>







<p>The methodology, process, or ethos that drives your team needs to be purpose built to achieve the outcome you want. At GigSmart they’re defined outcome was high quality and speed. As an on-demand staffing platform, they choose to prioritize hotfixes and bugs. Other companies might need to be more predictable, quality-driven, stable, consistent, etc. based on their business type and needed outcome.</p>







<ul start="3"><li>GigSmart is culture-driven&nbsp;</li></ul>







<p>“Build better, more engaged engineering teams… That’s probably what my actual official job description is. So culture really matters.” <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/our-dev-culture-is-based-on-bushido-samurai-code-my-interview-with-the-vp-of-engineering-at-gigsmart/">Chris and GigSmart CTO,&nbsp; Jason Waldrip, modeled their team cultural values</a> on the ancient samurai code of Bushido. 8 values that they’ve written down and strive to live and work by every day.&nbsp;</p>







<ul start="4"><li>GigSmart is data-driven</li></ul>







<p>Measuring is not enough, you have to measure with a purpose. You get what you measure. Everyone is familiar with this saying. Chris takes it a step further and actually encourages the team to look data about how they work in all of their day-to-day practices and ceremonies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By defining his company’s most valuable outcome and listening to his developers, Chris has created a development process that is bespoke to his team today. Just like a custom tailored suit, his development method cannot be easily used by another company. It had to be made up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>Make up your own dev methodology: 4 guiding ideas</strong></h2>

<p>Sometimes I just like building my own thing from the ground up. It’s why I started <a href="https://linearb.io/">LinearB.</a> Do you NEED to create your own development method? Definitely not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s much easier to start with Scrum or Kanban and adapt from there. But times, they are a changin’, and maybe this is a good year to go through the exercise of redefining how you work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After we started full-time remote back in March, my co-founder, Ori Keren, and I did just that. We created <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/asynchronous-development/">Asynchronous Development</a>, a development methodology designed around async communication and purpose-built for hybrid remote teams. It’s our favorite parts of Agile. A little bit of Scrum. A lot of what Ori and I learned over the years that really works for us. And a big dose of where we think the future of software development teamwork is headed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hundreds of teams are now following the Async Dev methodology. If we can make up our own dev methodology, you can too!&nbsp;</p>







<p><strong>Here’s 4 guiding ideas that will help you make up your own dev methodology</strong></p>







<ol><li><strong>Know your “why”&nbsp;</strong></li></ol>







<p>What matters to you? If it’s aligning to your company’s most important business goals, do you&nbsp; know what they are? Start-ups tend to want lots of new features as quickly as possible. More mature companies like predictability and quality. Find out and work backwards from there.&nbsp;</p>







<ol start="2"><li><strong>Don’t be dogmatic</strong></li></ol>







<p>Forget about the rules and just ask yourself… “How do we really want to work?” Ask your people. Especially your out-of-the-box thinkers. The more crazy ideas you throw in the mix, the more discussion you’ll create and the more you’ll end up with something that is really bespoke.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, the Agile manifesto says face-to-face communication is the most efficient way to transfer information. Is that still true for your team?</p>







<ol start="3"><li><strong>Retro your current process</strong></li></ol>



<p><strong><br></strong>Ask… “Why are we doing all of these things we do every day?” Do you really need a daily stand-up? Do you really need two week sprints? Are you realy getting value from them? The answer may be yes. But I bet if your team will have a lot of ideas of how they could be more dev-friendly and more efficient.&nbsp;</p>







<ol start="4"><li><strong>Bring data to the conversation&nbsp;</strong></li></ol>

			<p><em>Abstract: A few weeks ago, Orca Security published a comparison between the Orca Cloud Security Platform and a few other cloud security tools—including a&nbsp;<a href="https://orca.security/prisma-cloud-security/">comparison with Palo Alto Networks Prisma</a>. In response, Palo Alto Networks sent a <a href="https://orca.security/wp-content/uploads/PANW-Legal-Letter-Cease-Desist.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cease and desist letter</a>, demanding the comparison be removed immediately. Here is my response. I urge you to see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDnqJTEi6ynvsGkSJHYeEmhz6_NfzKgbf">the videos in question</a>&nbsp;and if you, like me, believe the cybersecurity community deserves transparency and vendors shouldn’t be allowed to prevent publishing reviews or benchmarks via legal threats, then please share this post. You can also leave your own comments down below.</em></p>
<p><strong>To: Palo Alto Networks</strong></p>
<p><strong>CC: The cybersecurity community</strong></p>
<p><strong>Subject: The Cybersecurity community demands transparency, not legal threats&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Security has always been about transparency. The concept of security by obscurity was frowned upon as early as 1851—even before the invention of electricity—when&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Charles_Hobbs">Alfred Hobbs</a>, a Massachusetts-based locksmith, demonstrated how then state-of-the-art locks could be picked. He explained that exposing the information would make the public more secure, as rogues already knew the deficiencies. The public needed to be educated, and he’d pursue better locks. Today’s locks are more advanced, but the principle is the same.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity community preaches about many products. All come with their own advantages and disadvantages, capabilities, and limitations. I believe that the only way practitioners can choose the tools that fit their environments best is by viewing factual evidence—not by relying solely on marketing materials. This is why we launched our&nbsp;<a href="https://orca.security/cloud-security-solutions/">Cloud Security Punch-Out! Series</a>, where we deploy a few tools—including Orca Security—on the exact same environment and share the results with viewers who deserve to see them. I urge you to take&nbsp;<a href="https://orca.security/prisma-cloud-security/">a look at the one we did with Palo Alto Networks;</a>&nbsp;as you’ll see we don’t hide those areas where Palo Alto Networks shines.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Palo Alto Networks is now trying to use legal threats to prevent us from publishing&nbsp;these video&nbsp;reviews. In <a href="https://orca.security/wp-content/uploads/PANW-Legal-Letter-Cease-Desist.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its letter</a>, Palo Alto Networks does not point to any factual inaccuracies in the reviews of its products’ performance. Instead, it premises its threats on flimsy, boilerplate contract terms that prohibit reviews and comparisons of its products and hollow trademark allegations purporting that Palo Alto Networks is sponsoring the videos.</p>
<p>It’s outrageous that the world’s largest cybersecurity vendor (its products being used by over 65,000 organizations according to its website), believes that its users aren’t entitled to share any benchmark or performance comparison of its products. According to its boilerplate contract terms that prohibit “disclosing, publishing, or otherwise making publicly available any benchmark, performance, or comparison tests” of its products, you’re in violation even if you publish the results of an internal comparison of Palo Alto Networks against other products as part of your procurement process. The same goes for the hundreds of Palo Alto Networks reviews on various sites that include G2 Crowd, Capterra, and Gartner Peer Insights. It means that only benchmarks approved by Palo Alto Networks can be published.</p>
<p>Palo Alto Networks appears oblivious to the fact that the New York Attorney General’s office&nbsp;<a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/2003579195misc2d3841519">sued and won an injunction</a>&nbsp;against McAfee from enforcing its contractual restrictions against publishing reviews or comparisons of its products without its consent more than 17 years ago. In enacting the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/45b">Consumer Review Fairness Act</a>, Congress has also prohibited businesses from including contract terms that prohibit consumers from reviewing products or services they purchase.</p>
<blockquote><p>Palo Alto Networks, do you think your products are flawless or that the bad guys will follow along, not openly talking about products’ deficiencies? If the answer is no to both, then why resort to legal threats to remove such benchmarks and comparisons? I refuse to accept a world where any vendor believes it has the right to prevent the free flow of information, and control which product reviews are made publicly available.</p></blockquote>
<p>I urge you to make your products better and focus your marketing efforts on demonstrating that, rather than throwing away money on ill-conceived gag efforts. Such action doesn’t benefit anyone. If you believe we missed something in our test, then tell us so we can make adjustments—we’ll happily integrate your comments and suggestions.</p>
<p>We could contract an objective third party to conduct additional tests. You could conduct your own tests with Palo Alto Networks and Orca Security’s products, then let the audience see and decide for themselves. All such actions would be far more beneficial to the industry, permitting both companies to learn and improve our products for the sake of customers.</p>
<p>As we all recently learned too well,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.contagionlive.com/news/sunlight-inactivates-the-airborne-virus-that-causes-covid19">sunlight is the best disinfectant</a>. The cybersecurity community deserves better than a vendor’s lack of transparency while wielding dubious legal methods. Palo Alto Networks is the worlds’ largest cybersecurity vendor; with great power comes great responsibility. Your products are great—but nothing is perfect, and the public should have free access to all of the facts.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,<br>
Avi Shua, CEO and Co-Founder<br>
Orca Security</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>I’ve been in and around eng hiring for the past 13 years, as an engineer, a recruiter, and a founder of a technical recruiting marketplace (interviewing.io). Over the course of those 13 years, I’ve become increasingly disgruntled at the state of hiring, and now I’m mad enough to write this blog post.</p>



<p>If you’ve ever been on either end of the table, you’re probably mad at the state of hiring, too. Whether you have given it a lot of thought or whether you just feel it deep down, something about the whole process feels off.</p>



<p>But we’ve been doing it this way for so long that we probably take much of how hiring works as gospel, and it’s really hard to tease apart all the different components of the process and examine why they are the way they are. In this post, I’d like to challenge many of the things we assume about hiring, and, perhaps most importantly, I’d like to lay out my platonic ideal for how eng hiring should work. It’s a simple axiom, really:</p>



<p><em>It should be easy for smart people to talk to other smart people.</em></p>



<p>Or, another way to put it … if I’m a good engineer, it should be easy for me to talk to a hiring manager at a company I might be interested in, at a time of my choosing. But that’s simply not possible today. Despite the refrain that we’re in a candidate’s market and that there’s a shortage of good candidates, which should mean that candidates should have the power to call the shots, today’s hiring process couldn’t be further removed from this ideal. And it’s not just broken for a specific type of candidate. It’s broken for <em>everyone.</em></p>



<p>If you’re reading this, you might be an engineering manager, a senior engineer with stellar credentials, a recent bootcamp grad, an engineer from a background traditionally underrepresented in tech, or some combination of these. <strong>What’s truly messed up about the status quo is that, regardless of which of these groups you fall into, your journey will be unnecessarily unpleasant. Though the degree of unpleasantness will not always be the same, it’s not about race, seniority, pedigree, or gender … or even which side of the table you’re on. Hiring, in its current incarnation, is broken for everybody.</strong></p>



<p>Why? Let us go then, you and I, into the bowels of the status quo.</p>



<h2>A candidate and a hiring manager, never the twain shall meet</h2>



<p>Let’s say that I’m a competent generalist engineer who looks good on paper, and I’m thinking that it’s time to look for a new job. What happens next? The idea of having to mount a full-on job search is so daunting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I could try some job boards to see which companies are out there. But what would I filter on? I know a lot of programming languages but am not set on having to work in a specific one. How can I tell if I’ll hit it off with the team? I’m applying via a job board to a position I know next to nothing about — will anyone even respond?</p>



<p>Suppose I find some companies where I might want to work. If I’m lucky enough to know someone there, I’ll have to get them to refer me, even though that may not actually do much to speed things along. And if I don’t know anyone there, applying will be an exhausting long shot. Odds are no one will look at my application, and having to redo my resume — or worse, write cover letters — seems like the most tedious kind of busywork.</p>



<p>I guess I can always dig through the recruiter spam I’ve gotten. But do those recruiters still work at the company? If they do, how long will it actually take to get into the process?</p>



<p>Breaking character for a moment, a friend of mine recently got this recruiting email from Google, who has elevated gaslighting to an art form: somehow the fact that it takes two months to get through their process has become a <em>selling point.</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="750" height="319" src="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fwd__Hello_From_Google__-_aline_interviewing_io_-_Interviewing_io_Mail-750x319.png" alt="" srcset="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fwd__Hello_From_Google__-_aline_interviewing_io_-_Interviewing_io_Mail-750x319.png 750w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fwd__Hello_From_Google__-_aline_interviewing_io_-_Interviewing_io_Mail-450x191.png 450w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fwd__Hello_From_Google__-_aline_interviewing_io_-_Interviewing_io_Mail-768x327.png 768w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fwd__Hello_From_Google__-_aline_interviewing_io_-_Interviewing_io_Mail.png 1004w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></figure>



<p>Once I do get into the process, why do I have to endure the same intro call ten times with different recruiters who can’t tell me anything about what I’d be working on at any level of depth?</p>



<p>Do I join some platform, create a profile that I copy-paste everywhere (with writing that was just as painful as the aforementioned resume/cover letter) and sort of hope that decent companies contact me … only to have to begin the same recruiter calls over and over again, as above?</p>



<p>Will I have to take some quizzes that drill me on obscure syntax or make me solve toy problems that have no bearing on my engineering ability before I even get to have the aforementioned inane conversation with a recruiter?</p>



<p><strong>If I’m actually good at my job, why can’t I just set up some conversations with companies I think are cool and see if it’s a fit? Why do I have to subject myself and others to an endless parade of vapid conversations and the inevitable busywork that precedes them?</strong></p>



<p>Here’s the truth. Even if I look good on paper and am well-connected, hiring still sucks because of all the noise, uncertainty, and time wasted … but at least I have options. They might not be exactly the right options for me, but at least they exist. On the other hand, if I’m an engineer without a pedigree or a network, my choices are extremely limited, no matter how good I am. Recruiters aren’t reaching out to me, I’m not well-networked enough to have friends refer me, and I <em>definitely </em>don’t hear back when I apply.</p>



<hr>



<p>Let’s take a look at the other side of the table. Let’s say I’m an eng manager who needs to hire more competent generalists for my team. Having worked as both an eng manager and a recruiter, I can tell you that what happens next isn’t particularly inspiring.</p>



<p>As an eng manager, I sit down with a recruiter and try to explain what I’m looking for. Nine times out of ten, I want a <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/06/05/smart-and-gets-things-done/">smart person who can get shit done</a>. But, after a farcical game of telephone, somehow those criteria get warped into years of experience with a specific technology or requirements about where the candidate went to school. I also end up with an uninspired, sterile job description that fails to capture the imagination of any candidates who might unwittingly stumble upon it.</p>



<p><strong>My recruiter then goes to any number of sourcing tools of which LinkedIn Recruiter is the ubiquitous, lackluster market leader. They type in keywords I didn’t ask for and filter on credentials I don’t care about to come up with the same homogenous list of candidates every other recruiter at every other tech company is chasing.</strong></p>



<p>They then contact these candidates en masse with generic copy about my team and the hard problems we’re solving. They celebrate single-digit response rates and spend the minimal time left over to give a cursory glance at candidates applying directly.</p>



<h2>Why is hiring broken?</h2>



<p>So therein lies the ineffectual dance. This is the process we’ve come to accept. As far as I can tease out, the axioms that underlie today’s recruiting best practices go something like this (some of these were told to me verbatim when I was starting out as a recruiter, even):</p>



<ol><li><strong>Thou shalt not engage with active candidates. After all, in this market, strong candidates aren’t looking. Good recruiters build relationships so that when a good candidate does decide to enter the market, the recruiter is there, behind the next doorway, ready to spring!</strong></li><li><strong>Engineering time is expensive, so it’s critical to do as much top-of-funnel filtering as possible to make sure that it’s spent on the right candidates.</strong></li></ol>



<p>Are these axioms wrong? The sad truth is … not really. I’ve written in a <a href="http://blog.alinelerner.com/the-unvarnished-unbundled-guide-to-hiring-tools/">previous post about how market forces rule everything around me</a>, and recruiting best practices are no exception. In an economy with a surplus of jobs and a shortage of talent, it follows that the best talent is going to be harder to find, engineering time will be expensive, and recruiters in their current incarnation are, dare I say it, a necessary evil. <sup><a href="#footnote_0_2455" id="identifier_0_2455" title="From what you’ve read up until this point, you might think that I hate recruiters and find them useless. Not so, dear reader! I hate bad recruiters. And, unfortunately, most of them are bad. What’s sad is that the good ones, instead of spending time on tasks for which they’re uniquely qualified and well-suited, are instead stuck at the top of the funnel sourcing engineers whose qualifications they don’t have the domain expertise to evaluate and selling them on roles they don’t have the domain expertise to describe. The best recruiters I’ve worked with are singularly amazing at shepherding candidates through the process, tirelessly stewarding a company’s employer brand, advising hiring managers on the best ways to close, keeping an analytical eye on the funnel to identify issues before they even arise, and much more.">1</a></sup></p>



<p>The data supports our current world view. According to Lever (one of the two application tracking systems widely used by startups, Greenhouse is the other), here’s a breakdown of how many candidates from each source it takes to make a hire. Note that here, larger numbers are bad — for many companies, internal referrals are the best source and inbound applications are the worst.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="750" height="375" src="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/graphLever2-750x375.png" alt="" srcset="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/graphLever2-750x375.png 750w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/graphLever2-450x225.png 450w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/graphLever2-768x384.png 768w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/graphLever2.png 1008w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.lever.co/recruiting-resources/articles/recruitment-process/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.lever.co/recruiting-resources/articles/recruitment-process/</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Looking at this data, you can see why recruiters simply ignore online applications. The same dynamics also apply to platforms such as AngelList — like any jobs board, it’s noisy and probably full of candidates who don’t have much leverage (e.g., juniors/bootcamp grads and people requiring visa sponsorship).</p>



<p>As for the value of eng time, guarding it carefully isn’t exactly wrong either. In fact, if you look at what a typical hiring process looks like today, you’ll see that most of the time spent is by engineers conducting interviews.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Hiring process stage</strong></th><th>Who does it?</th><th>How long does it take?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Resume review</td><td>Recruiter</td><td>10-30 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>Recruiter screen</td><td>Recruiter</td><td>45 min</td></tr><tr><td>Technical phone screen</td><td>Engineer</td><td>1 hour</td></tr><tr><td>Onsite – Eng portion</td><td>Engineer</td><td>6 hours</td></tr><tr><td>Onsite – Recruiter portion</td><td>Recruiter</td><td>1 hour</td></tr><tr><td>Offer</td><td>Recruiter OR Eng mgr</td><td>1 hour</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Engineering salaries are high, so given that most of the time spent on a single candidate is with engineers, it’s <em>rational</em> to put some recruiter gates at the top of the funnel to protect eng time. The idea is that recruiters will effectively screen out most candidates and only pass on the most promising ones to the eng team.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, when you look at an actual typical <em>funnel</em>, you’ll see that despite attempts to gate the top with recruiters filtering resumes and making intro calls, it’s not really working. Below is what a typical funnel looks like.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="750" height="89" src="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-03-23-17.34.42-750x89.png" alt="" srcset="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-03-23-17.34.42-750x89.png 750w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-03-23-17.34.42-450x53.png 450w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-03-23-17.34.42-768x91.png 768w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-03-23-17.34.42.png 1092w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></figure>



<p>If you <a href="https://blog.interviewing.io/you-probably-dont-factor-in-engineering-time-when-calculating-cost-per-hire-heres-why-you-really-should/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">do the math</a> and look at how many hours are spent — not per candidate but per hire (more useful because hires are ultimately what we want) — you’ll see that despite attempts to save eng time, recruiters spend roughly 15 hours a hire <sup><a href="#footnote_1_2455" id="identifier_1_2455" title="If we add in time to review resumes, it’s an extra five hours (at most).">2</a></sup> and engineers spend about 40.

        <div id="post-body"><p>Earlier this week, I was doing some work on AWS and wanted to know what IP addresses were being used. Luckily for me, AWS publishes this all here <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json" rel="nofollow noopener">https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json</a>. When you go through this list, you’ll quickly see that AWS has a massive asset of IPv4 allocations. Just counting quickly I noticed a lot of big prefixes.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ever wondered what all of the AWS network ranges are? You can find them all here:<a href="https://t.co/NBaBF6w0la">https://t.co/NBaBF6w0la</a><br>That's *a lot* of big prefixes!<br>4x /11, 14x /12, 30x /13, 78x /14, 184x /15, 278x /16</p>— Andree Toonk, Adelante! (@atoonk) <a href="https://twitter.com/atoonk/status/1316098702260359168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>However, the IPv4 ranges on that list are just the ranges that are in use and allocated today by AWS. Time to dig a bit deeper.</p><h3 id="ipv4-address-acquisitions-by-aws">IPv4 address acquisitions by AWS</h3><p>Over the years, AWS has acquired a lot of IPv4 address space. Most of this happens without gaining too much attention, but there were a few notable acquisitions that I’ll quickly summarize below.</p><h4 id="2017-mit-selling-8-million-ipv4-addresses-to-aws">2017: MIT selling 8 million IPv4 addresses to AWS</h4><p>In 2017 <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2017/05/mit-goes-on-ipv4-selling-spree/" rel="noopener">MIT sold half of its 18.0.0.0/8</a> allocation to AWS. This 18.128.0.0/9 range holds about 8 million IPv4 addresses.</p><h4 id="2018-ge-sells-3-0-0-0-8-to-aws">2018: GE sells 3.0.0.0/8 to AWS</h4><p>In 2018 the IPv4 prefix 3.0.0.0/8 was transferred from GE to AWS. With this, AWS became the proud owner of its first /8! That’s sixteen million new IPv4 addresses to feed us hungry AWS customers. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18407173" rel="nofollow noopener">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18407173</a></p><h4 id="2019-aws-buys-amprnet-44-192-0-0-10">2019: AWS buys AMPRnet 44.192.0.0/10</h4><p>In 2019 AWS bought a /10 from AMPR.org, the Amateur Radio Digital Communications (ARDC). The IPv4 range 44.0.0.0/8 was an allocation made to the Amateur Radio organization in 1981 and known as the AMPRNet. This sell caused a fair bit of discussion, check out the <a href="https://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2019-July/thread.html#102103" rel="noopener">nanog discussion here.</a></p><p>Just this month, it <a href="http://www.southgatearc.org/news/2020/october/sale-of-amateur-radio-amprnet-tcp-ip-addresses.htm" rel="noopener">became public knowledge</a> AWS paid $108 million for this /10. That’s $25.74 per IP address.</p><p>These are just a few examples. Obviously, AWS has way more IP addresses than the three examples I listed here. The IPv4 transfer market is very active. Check out this website to get a sense of all transfers: <a href="https://account.arin.net/public/transfer-log#NRPM-8.3IPv4" rel="noopener">https://account.arin.net/public/transfer-log</a></p><h3 id="all-aws-ipv4-addresses">All AWS IPv4 addresses</h3><p>Armed with the information above it was clear that not all of the AWS owned ranges were in the <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json">JSON</a> that AWS published. For example, parts of the 3.0.0.0/8 range are missing. Likely because some of it is reserved for future use.</p><p>Combining all those IPv4 prefixes, removing duplicates and overlaps by aggregating them results in the following list of unique IPv4 address owned by AWS: <a href="https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#all-prefixes" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#all-prefixes</a></p><p>The total number of IPv4 addresses in that list is just over 100 Million (100,750,168). That’s <strong>the equivalent of just over six /8’s,</strong> not bad!</p><p>If we break this down by allocation size, we see the following:</p><pre><code>1x /8     =&gt; 16,777,216 IPv4 addresses
1x /9     =&gt; 8,388,608 IPv4 addresses
4x /10    =&gt; 16,777,216 IPv4 addresses
5x /11    =&gt; 10,485,760 IPv4 addresses
11x /12   =&gt; 11,534,336 IPv4 addresses
13x /13   =&gt; 6,815,744 IPv4 addresses
34x /14   =&gt; 8,912,896 IPv4 addresses
53x /15   =&gt; 6,946,816 IPv4 addresses
182x /16  =&gt; 11,927,552 IPv4 addresses
&lt;and more&gt;</code></pre><p>A complete breakdown can be found here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#breakdown-by-ipv4-prefix-size" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#breakdown-by-ipv4-prefix-size</a></p><h3 id="putting-a-valuation-on-aws-ipv4-assets">Putting a valuation on AWS’ IPv4 assets</h3><blockquote>Alright.. this is just for fun…</blockquote><p>Since AWS is (one of) the largest buyers of IPv4 addresses, they have spent a significant amount on stacking up their IPv4 resources. It’s impossible, as an outsider, to know how much AWS paid for each deal. However, we can for fun, try to put a dollar number on AWS’ current IPv4 assets.</p><p>The average price for IPv4 addresses has gone up over the years. From ~$10 per IP a few years back to ~$25 per IP <a href="https://auctions.ipv4.global/" rel="noopener">nowadays</a>. <br>Note that these are market prices, so if AWS would suddenly decide to sell its IPv4 addresses and overwhelm the market with supply, prices would drop. But that won’t happen since we’re all still addicted to IPv4 ;)</p><p>Anyway, let’s stick with $25 and do the math just for fun.</p><pre><code>100,750,168 ipv4 addresses x $25 per IP = $2,518,754,200</code></pre><p>Just<strong> over $2.5 billion worth of IPv4 addresses,</strong> not bad! </p><h3 id="peeking-into-the-future">Peeking into the future</h3><p>It’s clear AWS is working hard behind the scenes to make sure we can all continue to build more on AWS. One final question we could look at is: <em>how much buffer does AWS have?</em> ie. how healthy is their IPv4 reserve?</p><p>According to their <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json" rel="noopener">published data</a>, they have allocated roughly 53 Million IPv4 addresses to existing AWS services. We found that all their IPv4 addresses combined equates to approximately 100 Million IPv4 addresses. That means they still have ~47 Million IPv4 addresses, or 47% available for future allocations. That’s pretty healthy! And on top of that, I’m sure they’ll continue to source more IPv4 addresses. The IPv4 market is still hot!</p></div>

          <p>If you’re like me, when you start coding something new, you’re probably finding yourself working with JSON.  Maybe you’re using Node.js or Python or any other dynamic language that uses JSON-like data natively or maybe you’re working with data that you’re pulling or serving from REST APIs. Either way, increasingly it seems like everything is ending up in JSON at some point.  Most of the time, this isn’t a problem, it’s just the way that we build software these days.  There’s just one problem, and that’s that Cassandra isn’t particularly good at JSON…</p>

<p>To double-click on that, the problem isn’t the JSON data format itself, although Cassandra doesn’t make JSON easy, it’s the way most devs use JSON when we’re building our apps.  Iterative development means that plans change.  The user registration form now needs a couple of more fields and the front-end dev went ahead and added them.  That API I’m calling returns some extra data.   Welcome to the loosely coupled world, it’s all fun and games until my app needs to send it to the database.</p>

<p>In the early days, Cassandra actually made this pretty simple to do, but as the project matured and added features like enterprise-friendly SQL-like query languages and better indexing, that meant that we needed the database to enforce a schema.  Over time, it became harder and harder to use Cassandra for things like JSON and other document-oriented use cases.</p>

<p>Enter Stargate - if there’s one thing you should know about the Stargate team it’s that our personal mission is to make Cassandra easy for every developer.  Figuring out how to give Javascript devs native JSON support without having to give up any of the reliability and scalability goodness of Cassandra was a challenge we couldn’t pass up.</p>

<p>This idea gave rise to the Stargate <strong>Documents API</strong>, which lets most Cassandra distros (Cassandra 3.11, Cassandra 4.0, and DataStax Enterprise 6.8), work with JSON through a REST API.</p>

<h2 id="api-features-and-design">API features and design</h2>

<p>As <a href="https://github.com/tjake">Jake Luciani</a> and I started to create the bones of this API, we realized that Cassandra is nothing like a document store. Expressing data as rows is straightforward, but expressing trees of JSON data is really not. In addition, mapping that JSON data onto a table managed by Stargate and keeping both writes and reads reasonably fast adds an additional layer of complexity.</p>

<p>From here, we mapped out three main design components in order for this work:
Modeling Documents in Cassandra
Handling Reads and Writes
Figuring out Deletes</p>

<p>The rest of this blog walks through how we approached each design and resolved some hiccups along the way.
Modeling Documents in Cassandra with Document Shredding</p>

<p>The first thing that we had to decide  was the schema of the managed table that backs a document collection. Due to some great discussions with some Cassandra specialists, it was decided that when a user creates a document, a table will be created with a statement of the form:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>create</span> <span>table</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>name</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>key</span> <span>text</span><span>,</span>
  <span>p0</span> <span>text</span><span>,</span>
  <span>…</span> <span>p</span><span>[</span><span>N</span><span>]</span> <span>text</span><span>,</span>
  <span>bool_value</span> <span>boolean</span><span>,</span>
  <span>txt_value</span> <span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>d</span>
  <span>bl_value</span> <span>double</span><span>,</span> <span>leaf</span> <span>text</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>At this point is where we had to solve an unbounded data modeling problem. Because any JSON document that has a depth of [N] or less can be added to this table, each value in the JSON will get stored as a row in the table. So if I wanted to represent a document called “x” that has the JSON:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>"a"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>"b"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>},</span><span> </span><span>"c"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The document would be “shredded” into rows looking like this:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>key</th>
      <th>p0</th>
      <th>p1</th>
      <th>dbl_value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>x</td>
      <td>a</td>
      <td>b</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>x</td>
      <td>c</td>
      <td>null</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For data with an array, such as:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>"a"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>"b"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>},</span><span> </span><span>"c"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[{</span><span>"d"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>}]}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>there would be two rows, like so:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>key</th>
      <th>p0</th>
      <th>p1</th>
      <th>p2</th>
      <th>dbl_value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>x</td>
      <td>a</td>
      <td>b</td>
      <td>null</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>x</td>
      <td>c</td>
      <td>[0]</td>
      <td>d</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Array elements are stored with square braces in the column.</p>

<h3 id="handling-reads-and-writes">Handling Reads and Writes</h3>

<p>The next problem that arose was that naïvely, updates to a document could require reading the document from the database, seeing what modification would have to be made, and then writing the updated data.  This “read-before-write” process is a notorious source of performance and consistency issues in most data stores.</p>

<p>Therefore, we resolved to avoid doing any read-before-write operations at all costs.</p>

<p>An interesting implementation detail that came up is that when you write some data to a document, the resulting write operation is just a simple batch with some inserts and deletes. In some cases, this can cause the document rows in the database to show two different states for the same JSON field.</p>

<p><em>And, upon reading the rows out, the Documents API reconciles conflicting information by accepting the data that has a later Cassandra write time (much like Cassandra itself!).</em></p>

<p>This allows us to write data really quickly while not compromising too much in reads either, as the reconciliation does not happen often and is also quite fast. It also gives us a very important core principle to our basic write and read operations:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Every write to a single document is a single batch of statements, and</li>
  <li>Every read from a single document is a single SELECT statement.</li>
</ol>

<p>So writes and reads are squared away - but what about deletes?</p>

<h3 id="figuring-out-deletes">Figuring out Deletes</h3>

<p>Because of the distributed nature of the database, a deletion in Cassandra actually is very similar to an insert, but instead a “tombstone” is written at a particular write time to signify the death of a row.</p>

<p>Rest in peace… almost</p>

<p>One very real danger here is that Cassandra may eventually crash with a “Tombstone Overwhelming” error as tombstones accrue. Cassandra periodically (the frequency here depends on your compaction strategy and/or cluster load) does a compaction operation to remove tombstones and alleviate this pressure, so the only way to avoid overwhelming Cassandra is to make sure that the frequency of deletions is low enough.</p>

<p>This poses a problem for the Document API specifically because of arrays. Let’s walk through this one.</p>

<p>Imagine that you have an array at some key that is of length 100000. If you then issue a replace operation (via a PUT) and decide to replace that array with some other value, then all of those 100000 rows would be deleted, causing 100000 tombstones to be written.  This is an enormous number of tombstones to be written in one operation, and if you do that just a few more times, Cassandra will likely crash or get super slow. So the structure of the data in each table needed one last major modification.</p>

<p>We said before that array paths are stored in the database with square brackets; for example the element at index 0 would be stored as [0]. That would mean a deletion of 100000 elements would look like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>name</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>where</span> <span>p0</span> <span>in</span> <span>(</span><span>'[0]'</span><span>,</span> <span>'[1]'</span><span>,</span> <span>'[2]'</span><span>,</span> <span>…</span><span>,</span> <span>'[99999]'</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Causing 100000 tombstones to be written. Instead of doing that, we decided to pad all array elements with leading zeros, so the element at index 0 would instead be represented as [000000], and the element at index 99999 would be [099999]. Doing this allowed us to change the deletion statement to:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>name</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>where</span> <span>p0</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>'[000000]'</span> <span>and</span> <span>p0</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>'[999999]'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Which causes only a single so-called “range” tombstone to be written, instead of 100000 cell tombstones (note that greater and less than works on strings in Cassandra and will compare lexically). It also relaxes the array length limit to one million elements, which is pretty neat! The time series below shows how the old vs. new implementation might behave, if you performed compactions every week:</p>

<p><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/tombstone_counts.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/tombstone_counts.png"></p>

<p>So the new strategy is just safer for deletions; it would require an incredibly large amount of deletion with the new strategy to even come close to the theoretical tombstone limits!</p>

<h2 id="preliminary-look-at-api-performance">Preliminary Look at API performance</h2>

<p>⚠️ Before starting on this section, we want to mention that benchmarking is a great tool, but does not necessarily represent how a system will behave under real load, out in the wild. We also haven’t done comparisons on the same hardware with other document stores…yet. Alright, let’s get to it!</p>

<p>In order to test that the Document API is reasonably fast, we ran a benchmark test using a single Cassandra storage node and a single Stargate node (Stargate is the API that contains the Documents API). We then ran two different benchmarks, one that uses HTTP GET to repeatedly get random paths in a document, and another that performs HTTP POSTs repeatedly to create brand new documents.  Each of these actions got run 100000 times, and here are two graphs of the results.</p>

<p>To keep things simple, as there is no baseline to compare things against just yet, the benchmark was performed using only one requester at a time, with light concurrency (10 users at once), and with more concurrency (100 users at once). Note that it’s expected with only one backend node that higher concurrency would cause degradation in performance; you should have multiple nodes to service that degree of concurrent requests!</p>

<p>Here are the results for reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here’s to the accidental security engineers. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently.</p>

  <p>To every engineer who’s ever spent a day scratching their head, wondering how to comply with a new security policy.</p>

  <p>To all those lost sprints building annoying primitives that “<em>have</em> to exist somewhere already”.</p>

  <p>To all the stressful weeks of getting pulled off new features to help prepare for an audit.</p>

  <p>To every web app, Slack bot, CLI, and microservice that was hacked together to help roll out a new control, only to become a pain-in-the-ass to maintain.</p>

  <p>It was us. We’ve been the ones tasked with building this mess. Constantly trading off velocity and security. But no more. We’re going to solve this problem, together, once and for all.</p>

  <p>Enter: Sym.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="hello-sym">Hello, Sym</h2>

<p>Sym is the security workflow platform made for engineers, by engineers. We solve the intent-to-execution gap between policies and workflows by providing fast-moving engineering teams with the just-right primitives to roll out best-practice controls.</p>

<p>Our hand-crafted Terraform templates let you easily provision instances of common security controls, while our Python SDK unlocks ridiculously simple customization to meet your team’s needs and integrate with existing tools. We’ve got our sights set on fixing the “Build vs Buy” problem with security workflows… the problem being that both options currently suck.</p>

<p>I’m overjoyed and humbled to share that we’re not embarking on this quest alone. We’re off to the races with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/sym-raises-9m-series-a-for-its-security-workflow-platform/">$9M Series A led by Sunil Dhaliwal at Amplify Partners</a>, following hot on the heels of a $3M Seed led by Robin Vasan at Mango Capital and Andy McLoughlin at Uncork Capital.</p>

<p>They say “never meet your heroes”, but with participation from security &amp; technology executives at GitHub, Datadog, Atlassian, Google, Bugsnag, and Segment, alongside early design partners like LaunchDarkly, we’re sure glad we met ours!</p>

<p>We’re excited to unveil our vision to the world, and announce that we’ve partnered with some of the best investors, engineers, and leaders in the industry to tackle this mountainous problem space. Every single person behind Sym has experienced our struggle first-hand (phew, we’re not crazy!), and won’t rest until we solve it. Let’s do this!</p>

<h2 id="howd-we-get-here">How’d we get here?</h2>

<p>Story time! I met Adam and Jon when I was a freshman at MIT. I distinctly remember walking into the Startup Career Fair wondering how I could circumvent the “no freshmen” rule most companies seemed to have when hiring interns. A friendly senior had let me know to watch out for the scores that recruiters would scrawl on resumes before haphazardly throwing them on the pile. A week prior, I watched a Facebook recruiter scratch a “1” onto mine, circling the sad number repeatedly before smiling and telling me to have a nice day. My world fell apart. This week was going to be different.</p>

<p>After having a great chat with this guy named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Tenev">Vlad</a> (Robinhood wasn’t a Big Deal yet), I ran into Adam. He was the VP of Engineering at a Boston-based company called Localytics, and seemed as relieved as I was to be having a conversation. I hesitantly bought into his pitch, and scheduled a time to come onsite. Little did I know, that thoughtless commitment would totally change the trajectory of my life, and one day be responsible for the founding of Sym!</p>

<p>The first meeting was uneventful, or so I thought. I showed up 30 minutes late to a rather exasperated Adam lecturing me on the demerits of interview tardiness. Throughout the years, I’ve grown very accustomed to that frustrated expression 😅. Though I’m still notoriously late for most things in life, I’ve never again failed to be punctual for a job interview!</p>

<p>Against his better judgement, Adam brought me on as an early intern at Localytics. It was my first job, and he was my first boss. I learned the ropes (read: how to ignore everyone’s advice while minimally pissing them off), and got to collaborate on some <a href="https://eng.localytics.com/your-code-coverage-is-bad-and-you-should-feel-bad/">really fun projects</a>. Jon (our third cofounder) spent a lot of time reprimanding me.</p>

<p>We spent the rest of the summer <del>fighting</del> working together, and ended with a particularly controversial project where, against the better judgement of basically everyone, I pumped out a heap of flaky Javascript code for saving reports, and then peaced out from the company ✌️.</p>

<p>I’m extremely grateful that over the span of a decade, I stayed in touch with these two. Our relationship evolved, from manager-intern, to mentor-mentee, to peers, to cofounders. When I stepped away from my last company to start Sym, those two were my first call. And boy, am I glad they were.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e009c90866e63034acc943efabdfa4a6457078d7/c6517/assets/hello-sym/map.png" alt="Map"></p>

<h2 id="evolution-of-sym">Evolution of Sym</h2>

<p>When Jon, Adam, and I sat down to build Sym, we wanted to solve a very simple problem: every engineering org we know in a heavily-regulated space was building the same damn tooling. Coming from healthcare and enterprise SaaS, we’d seen permutations of the same few workflows time and time again throughout our careers. A way to grant engineers temporary access to infrastructure? Check. A way to approve one-off queries? Check. Something to make quarterly risk assessments suck less? Check. Chat-Ops for approving outgoing deploys? Check.</p>

<p>The crazy thing was, these seemed to be ubiquitous across companies, compliance standards, even industries. Chatting with fellow founders about stuff I’d built to help keep my team productive would always result in one of two reactions: “<em>oh yea, we built the same thing! let’s trade notes…“</em>, or <em>“oh shit, we should have built this years ago”</em>. So we came up with a crazy idea: what if we just build all this stuff once, and put it out in the world for everyone to use. We were going to start with HIPAA-induced workflows. Sym: HIPAA in a box, for engineers. Of course, things rarely work out that simply.</p>

<p>We rapidly discovered something while talking to potential users: our hypothesis that everyone is building tools for the same workflows was a bit off. It wasn’t the case that everyone’s workflows were identical, but instead that they had the same <em>shared core</em>. It turns out, what most teams do is they start by building the same <strong>primitives</strong>, and then they layer on <strong>customizations</strong> that reflect existing processes and tools. So, we adjusted our approach to match this revelation.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/dc4f6494be10e2dfb90dc745bd96e83fffad695e/7aa7d/assets/hello-sym/graph.gif" alt="Graph"></p>

<p>Today, Sym is a set of workflow templates (<strong>primitives</strong>) for engineering teams working on improving security posture, and a suite of integrations (<strong>customizations</strong>) that connect those templates to existing systems and policies. Our mission is to enable any team to effortlessly build unobtrusive security and governance workflows, so we make sure to meet developers where they are: our primitives are exposed as Infrastructure-as-Code, and our SDK captures last-mile variance in workflows. The tools we use to distribute Sym Workflows are Terraform and Python, but your organization doesn’t have to be familiar with either to use us.</p>

<p>With Sym, you can roll out many common security and governance workflows with ~30 lines of declarative config and a couple function body definitions. Our goal is for you to blow your InfoSec team away; bring speed, sophistication, and thoroughness to your controls, without losing a whole month each time. Beautiful dashboards with just-right reports will materialize, without a single tedious line of logging code.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8b56882478ed2e08f51d3f70075e993d385a2eef/193db/assets/hello-sym/code.png" alt="Code"></p>

<p>We’re currently live (in production!) at a handful of public and private companies in the Healthcare and B2B SaaS spaces. Our initial workflows focus on governance and just-in-time access of cloud and app-level resources.</p>

<p>Our latest customer is locking down SSH access by rolling out <a href="https://compliance.dev/2020/03/23/aws-session-manager-ssh-tunnels-with-less-user-management/">AWS Session Manager tunnels</a> as the preferred way to connect to instances, with the IAM Role required to use SSM protected by Sym. This is one of many examples where we’re able to help infra teams adopt cutting-edge cloud offerings while increasing security posture. If this sounds like something that you’d like for your team, please <a href="https://symops.com/">reach out</a>!</p>

<h2 id="but-what-about-x">But what about X?</h2>

<p>We’re in a crowded space! Luckily, we see the world with a unique lens. Sym brings an emphasis on developer experience, opinionated workflows that codify best practices, and an aspiration to be the bridge between Security and Compliance. The jury’s still out on whether we’re totally brilliant or totally out to lunch.</p>

<p>Our vision at Sym is to become the de-facto standard for implementing and showcasing security posture. Importantly, we’re not setting out to be a middleman levying a tax on the system. We saw enough of those in our healthcare days. Instead, we’re striving to improve the status quo for every stakeholder in the security equation; our place as the obvious-choice bridge between security and compliance will be an emergent property of the system we’re fighting to improve.</p>

<p>We’ve got a long way to go to make that vision a reality. In the interim, we’re tackling several problems plaguing our friends and colleagues.</p>

<h3 id="security-intent-to-implementation-gap">Security intent-to-implementation gap</h3>

<p>A security intent-to-implementation gap is endemic in our industry today. Experts are laying out guidelines, policies, and best-practices, only to be foiled by the gargantuan effort required to implement workflows that reflect these intents. And to be honest, we can’t really blame engineering teams for this. As an industry, we’ve learned not to roll our own crypto, because it’s so easy to shoot yourself in the foot, but can you imagine how many ways there are to screw up a Slack bot that issues temporary database credentials? Or how easy it is to forget to put MFA around an admin God-mode dashboard? Twitter hack, anyone?</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2fa7f55e98cd8c615f0db83c6fd96236b49266a2/67dc7/assets/hello-sym/headlines.png" alt="Headlines"></p>

<p>Sensitive access workflows are the perfect example of a control that should be implemented once, and safely customized many times. This is where Sym is starting today.</p>

        <p>Football (or soccer to my American readers) is full of clichés: “It’s a game of two halves”, “taking it one game at a time” and “Liverpool have failed to win the Premier League”. You’re less likely to hear “Treating the number of goals scored by each team as independent Poisson processes, statistical modelling suggests that the home team have a 60% chance of winning today”. But this is actually a bit of cliché too (it has been discussed <a href="https://www.pinnacle.com/en/betting-articles/soccer/how-to-calculate-poisson-distribution">here</a>, <a href="https://help.smarkets.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115001457989-How-to-calculate-Poisson-distribution-for-football-betting">here</a>, <a href="http://pena.lt/y/2014/11/02/predicting-football-using-r/">here</a>, <a href="http://opisthokonta.net/?p=296">here</a> and <a href="https://dashee87.github.io/data%20science/football/r/predicting-football-results-with-statistical-modelling/">particularly well here</a>). As we’ll discover, a simple Poisson model is, well, overly simplistic. But it’s a good starting point and a nice intuitive way to learn about statistical modelling. So, if you came here looking to make money, <a href="http://www.make5000poundspermonth.co.uk/">I hear this guy makes £5000 per month without leaving the house</a>.</p>

<h2 id="poisson-distribution">Poisson Distribution</h2>

<p>The model is founded on the number of goals scored/conceded by each team. Teams that have been higher scorers in the past have a greater likelihood of scoring goals in the future. We’ll import all match results from the recently concluded Premier League (2016/17) season. There’s various sources for this data out there (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer">kaggle</a>, <a href="http://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php">football-data.co.uk</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jalapic/engsoccerdata">github</a>, <a href="http://api.football-data.org/index">API</a>). I built an <a href="https://github.com/dashee87/footballR">R wrapper for that API</a>, but I’ll go the csv route this time around.</p>

<p>We imported a csv as a pandas dataframe, which contains various information for each of the 380 EPL games in the 2016-17 English Premier League season. We restricted the dataframe to the columns in which we’re interested (specifically, team names and numer of goals scored by each team). I’ll omit most of the code that produces the graphs in this post. But don’t worry, you can find that code on <a href="https://github.com/dashee87/blogScripts/blob/master/Jupyter/2017-06-04-predicting-football-results-with-statistical-modelling.ipynb">my github page</a>. Our task is to model the final round of fixtures in the season, so we must remove the last 10 rows (each gameweek consists of 10 matches).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>epl_1617</span> <span>=</span> <span>epl_1617</span><span>[:</span><span>-</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
<span>epl_1617</span><span>.</span><span>mean</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>HomeGoals    1.591892
AwayGoals    1.183784
dtype: float64
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You’ll notice that, on average, the home team scores more goals than the away team. This is the so called ‘home (field) advantage’ (discussed <a href="https://jogall.github.io/2017-05-12-home-away-pref/">here</a>) and <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1803416-is-home-field-advantage-as-important-in-baseball-as-other-major-sports">isn’t specific to soccer</a>. This is a convenient time to introduce the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution">Poisson distribution</a>. It’s a discrete probability distribution that describes the probability of the number of events within a specific time period (e.g 90 mins) with a known average rate of occurrence. A key assumption is that the number of events is independent of time. In our context, this means that goals don’t become more/less likely by the number of goals already scored in the match. Instead, the number of goals is expressed purely as function an average rate of goals. If that was unclear, maybe this mathematical formulation will make clearer:</p>



<p> represents the average rate (e.g. average number of goals, average number of letters you receive, etc.). So, we can treat the number of goals scored by the home and away team as two independent Poisson distributions. The plot below shows the proportion of goals scored compared to the number of goals estimated by the corresponding Poisson distributions.</p>

<p><img src="https://dashee87.github.io/images/home_away_goals_python.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We can use this statistical model to estimate the probability of specfic events.</p>



<p>The probability of a draw is simply the sum of the events where the two teams score the same amount of goals.</p>



<p>Note that we consider the number of goals scored by each team to be independent events (i.e. P(A n B) = P(A) P(B)). The difference of two Poisson distribution is actually called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skellam_distribution">Skellam distribution</a>. So we can calculate the probability of a draw by inputting the mean goal values into this distribution.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># probability of draw between home and away team</span>
<span>skellam</span><span>.</span><span>pmf</span><span>(</span><span>0.0</span><span>,</span>  <span>epl_1617</span><span>.</span><span>mean</span><span>()[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span>  <span>epl_1617</span><span>.</span><span>mean</span><span>()[</span><span>1</span><span>])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<div><div><pre><code><span># probability of home team winning by one goal</span>
<span>skellam</span><span>.</span><span>pmf</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span>  <span>epl_1617</span><span>.</span><span>mean</span><span>()[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span>  <span>epl_1617</span><span>.</span><span>mean</span><span>()[</span><span>1</span><span>])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p><img src="https://dashee87.github.io/images/skellam_goals_python.png" alt=""></p>

<p>So, hopefully you can see how we can adapt this approach to model specific matches. We just need to know the average number of goals scored by each team and feed this data into a Poisson model. Let’s have a look at the distribution of goals scored by Chelsea and Sunderland (teams who finished 1st and last, respectively).</p>

<p><img src="https://dashee87.github.io/images/chelsea_sunderland_goals_python.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="building-a-model">Building A Model</h2>

<p>You should now be convinced that the number of goals scored by each team can be approximated by a Poisson distribution. Due to a relatively sample size (each team plays at most 19 home/away games), the accuracy of this approximation can vary significantly (especially earlier in the season when teams have played fewer games). Similar to before, we could now calculate the probability of various events in this Chelsea Sunderland match. But rather than treat each match separately, we’ll build a more general Poisson regression model (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_regression">what is that?</a>).</p>

<p>If you’re curious about the <code>smf.glm(...)</code> part, you can find more information <a href="http://www.statsmodels.org/stable/examples/notebooks/generated/glm_formula.html">here</a> (edit: earlier versions of this post had erroneously employed a Generalised Estimating Equation (GEE)- <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/16390/when-to-use-generalized-estimating-equations-vs-mixed-effects-models">what’s the difference?</a>). I’m more interested in the values presented in the <code>coef</code> column in the model summary table, which are analogous to the slopes in linear regression. Similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logistic regression</a>, we take the <a href="http://www.lisa.stat.vt.edu/sites/default/files/Poisson.and_.Logistic.Regression.pdf">exponent of the parameter values</a>. A positive value implies more goals (), while values closer to zero represent more neutral effects (). Towards the bottom of the table you might notice that <code>home</code> has a <code>coef</code> of 0.2969. This captures the fact that home teams generally score more goals than the away team (specifically, =1.35 times more likely). But not all teams are created equal. Chelsea has a <code>coef</code> of 0.0789, while the corresponding value for Sunderland is -0.9619 (sort of saying Chelsea (Sunderland) are better (much worse!) scorers than average). Finally, the <code>opponent*</code> values …</p></section></div></div>

It is doing so via a merger with Social Capital Hedosophia Corp II (NYSE: IPOB), which is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) led by investor <a href="http://www.socialcapitalhedosophiaholdings.com/index.html" rel="noopener">Chamath Palihapitiya</a>. Opendoor published an <a href="https://www.opendoor.com/w/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Opendoor-Overview_vPDF_02.pdf" rel="noopener">investor presentation</a> as part of its merger announcement in September, and last week the company <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801169/000110465920112009/tm2030455-1_s41.htm" rel="noopener">filed its S-4</a> (similar to an S-1, but used for companies engaged in a merger process). The transaction values Opendoor at $4.8B (pre-merger value) and the company will receive north of $1B in proceeds ($600M <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pipe-deal.asp" rel="noopener">PIPE</a> and $414M via merger with IPOB). While the SPAC merger process is quite interesting on its own (good posts on the topic <a href="https://medium.com/@andyravreby/attack-of-the-spac-baafd47f6ecc" rel="noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://luttig.substack.com/p/spac-attack-everything-a-founder" rel="noopener">here</a>), this post will focus in on the Opendoor business, its progress to date and its prospects for the future.</p><p id="ce64">Opendoor, founded in 2014, transforms the process of selling a home into a seamless digital experience, eliminating uncertainty for sellers. Sellers can go to Opendoor.com, receive an offer for their home, sign and close on the date of their choice — a dramatic improvement over the traditional selling process which can take 100+ days. In return, Opendoor receives a 6–12% discount on the market value of the home. This model is remarkably consistent with the vision described in Opendoor’s <a href="https://thomvest.box.com/v/opendoor_a" rel="noopener">Series A presentation</a> (worth a read). In addition to the spread captured when buying and selling homes, Opendoor earns revenue via ancillary services related to the real estate transaction, including title insurance, escrow services and home financing solutions.</p><p id="357e">In 2019, the company sold 18,799 homes across 21 markets, generating $4.7 billion in revenue (up more than 160% from the prior year). While the growth of the business has been impressive, Opendoor remains several years from profitability, having posted net losses of $339 million in 2019 and $117 million through the first half of 2020. Opendoor has ambitious plans to reach nearly 38,000 annual home sales and $10 billion in revenue by 2023. The company expects to become EBITDA-positive (on a non-GAAP basis) by the second half of 2023.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5208/1*ObnBGEhbx1BQTn-FZpNgjg.png" width="2604" height="920" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*ObnBGEhbx1BQTn-FZpNgjg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*ObnBGEhbx1BQTn-FZpNgjg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*ObnBGEhbx1BQTn-FZpNgjg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ObnBGEhbx1BQTn-FZpNgjg.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*ObnBGEhbx1BQTn-FZpNgjg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="eefd">While the core vision of the company is quite elegant (“building the digital one-stop shop to move” according to Opendoor founder Eric Wu), the path to realizing that vision is incredibly complex. It requires thousands of employees across dozens of markets, holding billions in home value at any given time. So what is Opendoor’s path to becoming a large <em>and</em> profitable company? Below I’ve outlined <strong>five key</strong> <strong>“things you need to believe”</strong> as the company marches down that path, as well as some thoughts around the Opendoor’s valuation relative to other public real estate companies.</p><h2 id="a8ea">1. Opendoor’s economies of scale drive down per-unit expenses &amp; box-out competitors</h2><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5220/1*TeL-vfUdrz4KJzeQg9BcWQ.png" width="2610" height="1154" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*TeL-vfUdrz4KJzeQg9BcWQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*TeL-vfUdrz4KJzeQg9BcWQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*TeL-vfUdrz4KJzeQg9BcWQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*TeL-vfUdrz4KJzeQg9BcWQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*TeL-vfUdrz4KJzeQg9BcWQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="ee83">Opendoor has built a massive home buying and selling operation that involves more than 1,000 employees across 21 markets. The company sold nearly 19,000 homes in 2019 (about 70 transactions per business day) and purchased thousands more. That scale is quite impressive given the fragmented, hyper-localized nature of real estate. This scale gives the company some important advantages:</p><ul><li id="0749">Opendoor has more borrowing capacity, a higher advance rate, and a lower cost of capital than many of its iBuyer peers; according to the company’s S-4, Opendoor has access to $2.8B in senior credit facilities with a total weighted average interest rate of 4%. It also has mezzanine facilities (loans that are subordinate to senior debt) in place to bring its effective advance rate to 100%. This allows the company to scale home purchase volume without tapping its own balance sheet.</li><li id="8800">Opendoor has developed a third-party network of more than 10,000 subcontractors, managed by a centralized operations team. This model has led to a 50% reduction in spend per home over the last 2 years. Additionally, the company has been able to negotiate bulk discounts on home materials (more than 40% lower than retail prices). According to <a href="https://www.mikedp.com/" rel="noopener">Mike DelPrete</a>, Opendoor’s average repair costs are about 2–2.5% of home value, compared to an estimated 4% at Offerpad and 5% at Zillow.</li></ul><p id="d50b"><strong><em>Potential Challenges</em></strong></p><p id="32f4">While economies of scale have definitely kicked in at Opendoor, there are also quite large fixed costs associated with operating the business that require <em>even greater</em> scale to overcome. For instance, in 2019 the company sold 18,799 homes and generated $301M in gross profit; however, its total operating expenses as a percentage of gross profit exceeded 180%.</p><p id="5020">Additionally, as the company continues to scale home purchase volume, incremental returns to scale may be diminished. For example, there are limitations to the bulk discounts suppliers can offer, limitations to cost of capital improvements, and some areas in which costs will always scale in proportion to volume (i.e. property taxes, utilities and insurance). And with time, its fellow iBuyers may achieve similar economies of scale. Given this dynamic, we expect the company to pursue incremental revenue streams as a means of improving its margin profile (more on this later).</p><h2 id="8003">2. Accumulating advantages makes the Opendoor business better &amp; more defensible over time</h2><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5884/1*GxiLv46smTkJlgphk1k20A.png" width="2942" height="1140" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*GxiLv46smTkJlgphk1k20A.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*GxiLv46smTkJlgphk1k20A.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*GxiLv46smTkJlgphk1k20A.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*GxiLv46smTkJlgphk1k20A.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*GxiLv46smTkJlgphk1k20A.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="eced">In addition to cost advantages that come with scale, Opendoor has developed a set of <em>accumulating data advantages</em> that are more proprietary and durable in nature. This informs the price it offers prospective home sellers, as well as the renovations made on purchased homes in order to maximize ROI. From the S-4:</p><blockquote><p id="b5aa">We have conducted over 150,000 home assessments during which we collect over 100 data points on each home and its surroundings. These proprietary data points have led us to make over one billion annotations and corrections to Multiple Listing Services (“MLS”) and tax assessor data, as well as build out new, non-traditional geospatial data assets, such as power line ​proximity and road noise level. The additional home level data we collect from local vendors provides structured feedback on each home and further strengthens our data moat.</p></blockquote><p id="9893">This data asset leads to better pricing models that can assign specific values to home features (i.e. granite vs. tile countertops) as well as identify the areas in which home renovations may drive the highest return. Better pricing accuracy creates an important flywheel for the business: pricing accuracy improvements allow Opendoor to lower the fee it charges, which increases purchase volume, which in turn further contributes to its data asset and pricing accuracy. There are also accumulating advantages around brand which may improve Opendoor’s customer acquisition costs over time. It’s no surprise that despite the proliferation of iBuyers over the last several years, Opendoor remains the largest with 64% market share (as of 2019).</p><p id="eefe"><strong><em>Potential Challenges</em></strong></p><p id="14b6">As the chart above indicates, iBuyers in total capture about 0.7% of U.S. home sale volume (pre-COVID). In Phoenix, Opendoor has bought and sold homes for the last six years, completing thousands of transactions and refining its pricing and operational models along the way. In Q1 2020, Opendoor reached 4.1% market share in Phoenix before pausing home buying due to COVID-19.</p><p id="c9c2">While that’s certainty impressive scale in a single market, it’s also indicative of the potential limits to capturing even more share — a large subset of sellers may simply prefer to market their homes as opposed to selling to an iBuyer at a discount. The next chapter of Opendoor’s growth story may not come solely from better pricing models, but instead by building new products and services that cater to multiple customer segments.</p><h2 id="4df8">3. Opendoor will be able to increase gross profit per transaction via ancillary products and services</h2><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5224/1*kon3TuiR4W6a9B454wG1aA.png" width="2612" height="1064" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*kon3TuiR4W6a9B454wG1aA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*kon3TuiR4W6a9B454wG1aA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*kon3TuiR4W6a9B454wG1aA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*kon3TuiR4W6a9B454wG1aA.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*kon3TuiR4W6a9B454wG1aA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="6e55">Critical to the Opendoor strategy is its ability to attach additional products and services to its transactions. The company expects its gross profit per home to increase by about $8,000 in 2023, driven primarily by these ancillary revenue streams. In its investor presentation, Opendoor highlighted several service areas, including:</p><ul><li id="3bbb">Integrated title insurance and escrow services (via its <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/opendoor-acquires-title-and-escrow-company-os-national-300912033.html" rel="noopener">acquisition of OS National</a> in 2019). 80% of Opendoor home transactions that closed during 2019 included the in-house title &amp; escrow service (in the markets in which the service was available). This represents $1,750 in incremental margin per home.</li><li id="f807">The company recently launched <a href="https://opendoorhomeloans.com/?abad=true" rel="noopener">Opendoor Home Loans</a>, a tech-enabled mortgage platform for customers looking to buy or refinance a home, which is licensed in eight states. This represents $5,000 in incremental margin per home.</li><li id="7404">Opendoor plans to add additional services over time, such as home insurance, home warranty, moving and storage, and home repair and maintenance. It believes these services represent up to $7,500 in incremental margin per home.</li></ul><p id="695c">The roll out of multiple services allows the company to create incentives for bundling. For example, Opendoor may be willing to lower its home purchase fee (currently 6%-12%) if a customer agrees to finance their next home with Opendoor Home Loans, or purchases an Opendoor home insurance policy. Bundling may then improve seller conversion rates — according to Opendoor’s investor presentation, sellers are about twice as likely to sell their home at a 6% fee vs. a 12% fee.</p><p id="47cf">This strategy has been executed successfully by home builders for many years. For example, <a href="https://lennar.com/" rel="noopener">Lennar</a> has an in-house financing arm called Eagle Point, which is used by buyers to finance about 70% of Lennar’s home sales.</p><p id="8c30"><strong><em>Potential Challenges</em></strong></p><p id="f697">As the Lennar expample indicates, this strategy around attaching multiple revenue streams to a real estate transaction is not new — it’s common amongst real estate brokerages, home builders, and technology-enabled real estate companies like Zillow. While Opendoor has demonstrated that it can generate a high attach rate with title &amp; escrow, the company did not provide data around its mortgage business or buy-side services. Title &amp; escrow are typically viewed as commodity offerings and consumers are more likely …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Creating a successful new business is hard in any industry, but in insurance itâ€™s an especially daunting challenge. You need a world-class team, a differentiated product, and deeply supportive and patient carrier partners. Even with all of that, you need a healthy serving of luck.</p><p>At Newfront, weâ€™ve been incredibly fortunate to have all of those ingredients. And while weâ€™re still a long way off from achieving our ambitions, today is an important milestone. We've spent the last three years focusing on building a strong business, and today we're announcing that <strong>weâ€™ve raised more than $100MM to date, most recently at a $500MM valuation</strong>. Founders Fund and Meritech Capital are our lead investors. A full list of investors is <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/abe-4">here</a>.</p><p>While our journey is far from over, this has certainly been a time for us to pause and reflect on how far weâ€™ve come. My own story with insurance began early in my career. I was lucky to help build two highly successful companies (Invitation Homes and Opendoor) and in both cases I was tasked with handling our property and casualty insurance. While happy to take care of something as critical as mitigating existential risk, I was stunned by the archaic and confusing process. I filled out mountains of paperwork, waited for weeks, and then received back wildly different options that were nearly impossible to compare. There was no clear dataset to help me understand which carriers to approach, which coverages to seek, or how peer businesses were buying. The process repeated each year, and was even worse when dealing with claims.</p><p>As a businessperson, it shocked me that the safety net so crucial to a functioning economy, innovation, and entrepreneurship could be so broken. I dug in and found that I wasnâ€™t alone in feeling the pain. My co-founder Gordon, an MIT grad who built a startup acquired by LinkedIn, had dealt with the pain of buying insurance for his company. For too many business owners, dealing with insurance has become an unpleasant, almost unbearable process. For insurance industry professionals, doing their jobs has become tedious, with the productivity gains made in other industries passing them by, forcing longer hours for lower pay. For industry leaders, attracting high-quality talent to the industry has become an existential challenge. I became obsessed with the idea of modernizing the industry by empowering the people at its core with purpose-built technology.Â&nbsp;</p><p>Gordon and I launched Newfront in 2017, a year in which several startups were attracting huge investments with a goal of eliminating insurance brokers. We were convinced that their approach was dead wrong. We had already spent countless hours with CFOs, GCs, risk managers, and business owners and concluded that skilled insurance brokers are a <strong><em>foundational requirement</em></strong> for high-quality risk mitigation. The problem wasnâ€™t the broker, it was the brokerage. The typical brokerage forced brokers to behave like data collection and paperwork processing machines, preventing them from deepening their skills or providing expert advice. The brokerages had abandoned their brokers. We resolved to do something about that.</p><p>But first we needed to learn what had gone wrong. Why had brokerages fallen so far behind the innovation curve? Why was the average net promoter score for brokerages sitting at a dismal 17 (with 100 being the best)? Why werenâ€™t brokers given the tools that they needed? It didnâ€™t take long to learn that many of these changes resulted from the rise of private equity within the industry. Over a dozen years, private equity funds had purchased thousands of brokerages around the United States with an exclusive focus on generating short-term gains for their investors, rather than long term value for clients. These funds, which operate on short investment windows, do not have the time or incentive to make material investments in technology, the client experience, or tools to support brokers.Â&nbsp;</p><p>Our model is different. We have the resources, commitment, and know-how to create the brokerage that is truly built for the 21st century. A brokerage where we build our own technology and software in-house, where innovation is our mantra, and where improving outcomes and experiences for our clients is an obsession. While weâ€™ve learned a great deal over the past three years (and made plenty of mistakes along the way!), our founding thesis hasnâ€™t changed -- <strong><em>that the future of our industry combines experts with technology to better serve clients</em></strong>.Â&nbsp;</p><p>Today we are a team of nearly 200, proudly serving over 5,000 clients across nearly every industry. While we are still only beginning our journey, our book already puts us in the top 100 brokerages in America. And weâ€™re just getting started.</p></div></div>]]>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  
  

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Find common Chinese characters using pinyin.</p>

<p>Click the image to try it now:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thomasvanderberg.nl/cn/hanzi/"><img src="https://www.thomasvanderberg.nl/images/hanzi_screenshot.png" alt="Hanzi searchtool showing common Chinese characters pronounced &quot;shi&quot;"></a></p>

<h2 id="what">What</h2>

<p>It’s a tool that allows you to enter pinyin and optionally a tone number and shows only the <em>commonly used</em> Chinese characters with this pronunciation.</p>

<p>It allows you to switch between the top 3500 character list (frequently used) or the top 6500 (relatively common),</p>

<p>Some other features include showing or hiding all pinyin pronunciations for the characters, and showing or searching by the index of the character from the source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_General_Standard_Chinese_Characters">Table of General Standard Chinese Characters</a>.</p>

<p>It currently only deals with simplified characters, because that’s what the source deals with and what I’m trying to learn.</p>

<p>Note that this is not a comprehensive Chinese learning tool. To learn Chinese you need to learn words, not just characters. Characters are just one layer in the Chinese language, and even full understanding of all Chinese characters would not mean you’ve learned the language.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-made-this">Why I made this</h2>

<p>While learning Chinese, I wanted to get an understanding of which Chinese characters are actually in common use. If you look in a dictionary for a list of Chinese characters, you will get a bewildering amount of characters. Dictionaries try to be comprehensive. Fortunately, most of these are only in historic use.</p>

<p>I wanted to remove the forest of irrelevant (for my purposes) characters and find get a list of ones actually worth investing time into.</p>

<p>I made this to get an overview and easily be able to answer questions like “how many common characters share this pronunciation?”.</p>

<p>I also wanted it to work without having to wait for a web page to load for each query. I made it work using a fully offline search (you download the data when loading the page itself).</p>

<h2 id="sources-and-data">Sources and data</h2>

<p>During my search I found this official list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_General_Standard_Chinese_Characters">Table of General Standard Chinese Characters</a> made by the Chinese government.</p>

<p>Sadly, this list is a rasterized PDF which does not even contain the pronunciation of these characters.</p>

<p>Still, it seemed like a good authoritative reference of commonly used characters. I started searching around and found a text version of it on <a href="http://xh.5156edu.com/page/z6211m4474j19255.html">this Chinese webpage</a>. While checking the data I found it had some mistakes around characters 3649 to 3668, which I had to fix manually.</p>

<p>To combine this with pronunciation data I found the <a href="ftp://ftp.cuhk.hk/pub/chinese/ifcss/software/data/Uni2Pinyin.gz">Unicode Pinyin Table</a>. I’ve added numerouos pronunciations manually, when I found them missing from that source. I’ve logged my manual edits in <a href="https://www.thomasvanderberg.nl/files/edits-to-hanzi-pinyin.txt">edits-to-hanzi-pinyin.txt</a>. Note that since I’m only a basic Chinese speaker myself, I can’t exclude that there’s likely more mistakes. I’m open to using a more reliable source for pronunciation data if one is available.</p>

<p>Using this data I created the <a href="https://www.thomasvanderberg.nl/files/hanzi-pinyin.6500.csv">hanzi-pinyin.6500.csv</a> and <a href="https://www.thomasvanderberg.nl/files/hanzi-pinyin.3500.csv">hanzi-pinyin.3500.csv</a> files which are the source of the Hanzi search tool.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-i-make-this">How did I make this</h2>

<p>Originally I just used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a> to search the hanzi-pinyin CSV files, but found it to become cumbersome due to the need to write regular expressions when I just wanted to think about pinyin.</p>

<p>I created the <a href="https://www.thomasvanderberg.nl/files/cnhz.py">cnhz</a> python script for myself, originally as a simple wrapper to build the grep regexes for me so I could just write pinyin. I then added more features around it.</p>

<p>As it got more useful I thought about how I could make it more accessible for other Chinese learners too. Most of them do not use Linux or have Python installed. I thought of rewriting it in Go to make it a single executable - but found the command line format would be awkward for most people. Also Windows cmd.exe does not support Chinese characters.</p>

<p>I eventually decided to turn it into a webpage. the CSV files were sufficiently small that the entire database could be loaded into the browser’s memory so you could do a completely client side search - making the experience much smoother than loading an online dictionary entry.</p>

<p>Also, because I can easily host it on my own web page, which I pay for anyway, I don’t have any need to add advertisements or anything to make the experience worse.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the page can easily be downloaded and used offline by any learner in case my site goes down or for when you don’t have internet.</p>

<p>I tried to support offline working more by making the site into a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps">progressive web app</a>. However, while adding a manifest was easy, I found that to add a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API">service worker</a> (which allows offline caching) - I would have to move all assets including a copy of my main CSS file to /cn/hanzi/. Not having time to figure this out at the moment, I decided to not add service workers for now.</p>

<p>By the way, the <a href="http://localhost:4000/js/hanzi_list.js">hanzi_list.js</a> file was generated from the CSV sources using an <code>awk</code> script:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&lt; ../files/hanzi-pinyin-full.csv \
    awk \
    'NR==1 { printf "const hanzi_3500 = \"" }
     NR==3501 { printf "\"; const hanzi_6500 = hanzi_3500 + \"" }
     { print NR","$0"\\n\\" }
     END { print "\";\nconst hanzi_6500_split = hanzi_6500.split(\"\\n\");" }' \
 &gt; ../js/hanzi_list.js
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I hope you find my <a href="https://www.thomasvanderberg.nl/cn/hanzi">Chinese hanzi tool</a> useful. If you have any questions or want to contact me, see my details below.</p>

October 20, 2020 | https://www.osohq.com/post/runtime-reflection-pt-2 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.osohq.com/post/runtime-reflection-pt-2">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is Part 2 in our blog series on our experience building a runtime reflection system in Rust for our policy engine, oso. </p>
<p>In Part 1, we built a simple class system, with a metaclass struct called <code>Class</code> to track type information. We also introduced the <code>Instance</code> struct to wrap any object and erase the type using <code>dyn Any</code>. You can find Part 1: dyn Class <a href="https://www.osohq.com/post/rust-reflection-pt-1">here</a>. </p>
<p>In this post, we'll go through how we support accessing arbitrary attributes on our instances at runtime. There are multiple approaches to solving this problem, including the use of traits from the standard library and commonly used crates like <code>serde</code>. We'll talk through the pros and cons of each, and the version we landed on: adding attribute getters.</p>
<h2>Accessing attributes on a struct</h2>
<p>Suppose we have a struct:</p>
<pre><code>struct Foo {
    x: u32,
}
</code></pre>

<p>We would like to write the following code in <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/polar-syntax.html">Polar</a>, the oso Policy language:</p>
<pre><code>x_is_one(foo: Foo) if
    foo.x = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>and have it check that <code>foo</code> has an attribute called <code>x</code> and that its value is 1.</p>
<h3>What makes this so hard?</h3>
<p>To start with, there is no <code>getattr(foo, "x")</code> equivalent in Rust. And what makes this hard to implement ourselves is that Rust (by default) provides no guarantees about things like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-layout.html#the-default-representation">the memory layout of a struct</a>. In fact, in some cases will simply <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nomicon/exotic-sizes.html#zero-sized-types-zsts">optimise away the field entirely</a>. Even in debug builds, a debugger might be unable to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/46698">lookup the value of variables</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, if you haven't <em>explicitly</em> told Rust that you want it to let you access an attribute, you're unlikely to get it.</p>
<h2>Our approach</h2>
<p>Let's start by thinking about the method signature for dynamic access. We would like to take in an <code>Instance</code> and an attribute name (<code>&amp;str</code>), and return a value to the policy engine.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<pre><code>Fn(&amp;Instance, &amp;str) -&gt; PolarValue;
</code></pre>

<p>There are actually two distinct places we could conceivably implement this method: on <code>Instance</code>, and in <code>Class</code>.</p>
<p>On one hand, if we implement it directly on <code>Instance</code>, then we don't need to do any more work to look up the class in order to get attributes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we need to store the attributes <em>somewhere</em> so that we can add them to the instance on creation. So we would probably need to store these these on the <code>Class</code> anyway, and then copy them onto the <code>Instance</code>.</p>
<p>It's a subtle distinction, but for us it made more sense to the keep the instance lightweight, and to use the <code>Class</code> to store the attribute lookups. Although in Python its perfectly valid to add attributes to a class on the fly, we have that requirement in neither the host language nor in Polar.</p>
<p>To make the above work, we simply add a method on an <code>Instance</code> to retrieve the class of it, and we can get attributes from there:</p>
<pre><code>impl Instance {
    fn get_class(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;&amp;Class&gt; { ... }

    pub fn get_attribute(&amp;self, name: &amp;str, host: &amp;mut Host) -&gt; crate::Result&lt;Term&gt; {
        let class = self.class(host)?
        class.get_attribute(self, name)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Implementing the getter</h3>
<p>To implement the <code>get_attribute</code> method, we can either implement (a) a method that can fetch <em>all</em> attributes, or (b) a method for each attribute.</p>
<p>We opted for (b), which gives us the most flexibility to decide on a per-attribute basis how the lookup works.  <code>Class</code> stores a map from attribute names to getters:</p>
<pre><code>/// Class definitions
struct Class {
   ...

    /// Map from attribute name to the attribute lookup
    attributes: HashMap&lt;&amp;'static str, AttributeGetter&gt;
}

struct AttributeGetter(Arc&lt;dyn Fn(&amp;Instance) -&gt; PolarValue);
</code></pre>

<p>We've now split the attribute lookup into two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look up the getter for the named attribute: <code>(instance, name) → (instance, attributes.get(name)) → (instance, f)</code></li>
<li>Apply the getter method: <code>(instance, f) → f(instance)</code></li>
</ol>
<p>A simple example of an attribute getter is the closure <code>|foo: &amp;Foo| foo.x</code> which has <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/closure.html">a unique anonymous type</a> – written <code>[closure@&lt;source code location&gt;]</code>   —  and implements the trait <code>Fn(&amp;Foo) -&gt; R</code>. </p>
<p>To store this on the class we need to do some dynamic type mapping again. First, we have in our hands an <code>Instance</code>, not a <code>Foo</code>. We saw in the last post that <code>downcast</code> would allow us to get back to a concrete type. Furthermore we cannot store a function that returns <whatever the="" type="" of="" <code="">foo.x is&gt;. Instead, we make sure to do the conversion back to a <code>PolarValue</code> as part of looking up the attribute.</whatever></p>
<p>To make it a bit easier to create such type-erased functions, and to make it easier for users of oso, the <code>AttributeGetter</code> provides a new method which handles this for them:</p>
<pre><code>impl AttributeGetter {
    pub fn new&lt;T, F, R&gt;(f: F) -&gt; Self
    where
        T: 'static,
        F: Fn(&amp;T) -&gt; R,
        R: crate::ToPolar,
    {
        Self(Arc::new(move |receiver: &amp;Instance, host: &amp;mut Host| {
            // get back the original type of the receiver
            let receiver = reveiver.downcast().expect("type error");
            // call the function; convert the result
            f(receiver).map(|res| res.to_polar(host))
        }))
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We use this in the builder method:</p>
<pre><code>impl&lt;T: 'static&gt; ClassBuilder&lt;T&gt; {
  pub fn add_attribute_getter&lt;F, R&gt;(mut self, name: &amp;'static str, f: F) -&gt; Self
    where
        F: Fn(&amp;T) -&gt; R,
        R: crate::ToPolar,
    {
        self.attributes.insert(name, AttributeGetter::new(f));
        self
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>One nice property of the above is that it's a compile-time error to define an attribute getter for the wrong class! So despite erasing the type when constructing an <code>Instance</code> and later recovering the type dynamically, it's impossible to provide the wrong getter:</p>
<pre><code>error[E0631]: type mismatch in closure arguments
  --&gt; languages/rust/oso/examples/blog.rs:53:14
   |
53 |             .add_attribute_getter("y", |foo: &amp;Bar| foo.y)
   |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      ----------------- found signature of `for&lt;'r&gt; fn(&amp;'r example_two::Bar) -&gt; _`
   |              |
   |              expected signature of `for&lt;'r&gt; fn(&amp;'r example_two::Foo) -&gt; _`
</code></pre>

<h3>Trying it out</h3>
<p>Okay, let's see it in action! We'll start with some test setup:</p>
<pre><code>struct Foo { x: u32, }

#[test]
fn test_get_attribute() {
    // Setup the host environment
    let polar = crate::Polar::new();
    let mut host = Host::new(Arc::new(polar));

   ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we're a runtime class system, we need something to manage these classes at runtime. This is our <code>Host</code> object. <code>Host</code> will be responsible for things like storing class definitions and caching instances. </p>
<p>Next, we define the <code>Foo</code> class:</p>
<pre><code>// builder for defining the Foo class
let foo_class: Class = Class::builder::&lt;Foo&gt;()
    .add_attribute_getter("x", |foo| foo.x)
    .build();
// register the Foo class on the host
host.cache_class(foo_class, "Foo".into()).unwrap();
</code></pre>

<p>We added a simple builder pattern to make it easier to register attributes in bulk, and the built <code>Class</code> is cached on the <code>host</code>.</p>
<p>With the setup done, we can try out accessing attributes dynamically:</p>
<pre><code>let foo_instance: Instance = Instance::new(Foo { x: 1 });
// get the value of "x" from the instance
let get_x = foo_instance.get_attribute("x", &amp;mut host).unwrap();

// check the result is the PolarValue for 1
assert_eq!(get_x, polar_core::term!(1));
</code></pre>

<p>The test looks up the value of "x" on the instance of foo, and compares it to the expected result. Dynamic attributes in action! The returned value is now a Polar term, since in normal operation the return value would be sent to the Polar VM.</p>
<p>The benefit of this approach is it gives the user a lot of optionality: for cases where the attribute doesn't implement <code>ToPolar</code>, we can handle conversions right in the closure defined. And the implementation itself is super simple.</p>
<p>The main downside of the approach is that it is <em>very</em> manual. For every attribute a user wants to use, they need to add the <code>add_attribute_getter</code> line.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in the <code>oso</code> crate, we also provide a derive macro which can handle this. We still make getting attributes an opt-in process, but the code from above becomes:</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(PolarClass)]
struct Foo { 
    #[polar(attribute)]
    x: u32,
}

#[test]
fn test_get_attribute() {
    ...

    // builder for defining the Foo class
    let foo_class: Class = Foo::get_polar_class();

    ...
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Alternate Approaches</h2>
<p>The approach we outline above suits our needs, but is leveraging virtually nothing from the Rust standard library nor the Rust ecosystem. Is there really nothing out there to address this problem?</p>
<p>We'll take you through a few of the alternatives we tried. Some of them are complementary to the approach we've taken and would be reasonable future additions, others just didn't quite seem to be what we needed.</p>
<p>In no particular order:</p>
<h3>Implement <code>Index&lt;String&gt;</code></h3>
<p>In some ways, the most direct route we could take would be to use the <code>Index&lt;String&gt;</code> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Index.html">trait</a>. This is normally used for data structures like <code>Vec,</code> which allow you to index into it with <code>vec[i]</code>, or with <code>HashMap</code>, which allows you to get a key with <code>map[&amp;key]</code>.</p>
<p>The benefit of using a trait from the standard library is that users may get implementations of the trait for "free", e.g., if they are already using a <code>HashMap</code>, then they don't need to do any additional work to define attribute getters that leverage the trait.</p>
<pre><code>impl ClassBuilder&lt;T&gt; {
    fn supports_indexing(mut self) -&gt; Self
    where T: Index&lt;&amp;str&gt;
    {
        self.set_attribute_lookup(|receiver, attr| {
            receiver.index(&amp;attr)
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is: what is the output type for <code>Index</code>? We need it to be any type that can be converted back into the Polar core –&nbsp;perhaps <code>Box&lt;dyn ToPolar&gt;</code> or similar. To make that happen, we would be requiring the user to implement a version of <code>Index</code> for their classes, which is unlikely to be something they will want in the rest of their code. Given this, it doesn't seem like there is much benefit to using <code>Index</code>.</p>
<h3><code>serde::Serialize</code></h3>
<p>Whenever we encounter a problem that requires some form of translation, <code>serde</code> comes to mind. </p>
<p>We could require types to implement <code>serde::Serialize</code>. By writing our own custom serializer, this would give us a way to leverage the existing machinery for walking over all the fields of a struct. And the ubiquity of …</p></div></div></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Most of the time, to get root on an Android device you will use a tool like <a href="https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk">Magisk</a>. However, there may be cases where Magisk doesn't work or isn't ideal. For example, on IoT or embedded devices that don't have a traditional Android interface.</p><p>In these instances, it might be easiest to interact with the device through adb. Though more often than not adb runs as the lower privileged shell user, and the <code>adb root</code> command doesn't let you elevate permissions. It simply returns a <code>adbd cannot run as root in production builds</code> error.</p><p>If you search around the web you will find various advice telling you to add the <code>ro.debuggable=1</code> setting to the <code>default.prop</code> file, which is supposed to tell adbd it's allowed to run as root. This may work, but if it doesn't it's probably because the version of Android you're using wasn't compiled with the <code>ALLOW_ADBD_ROOT</code> flag, and the adbd code isn't configured to check the <code>ro.debuggable</code> setting.</p><p>Fortunately not all hope is lost. If all else fails, and you have the ability to upload a new boot partition to the device, you should be able to patch the adbd binary to run as root. Regardless of how the rest of the system has been configured.</p><p>Christian Weiske has a great <a href="https://cweiske.de/tagebuch/android-root-adb.htm">post</a> that introduced me to this concept. In my case, I just had to make a few modifications since the version of adbd I had was "newer" (Nougat), and I used a different method for modifying the boot image.</p><p>I'll assume you have already found a way to get a hold of the boot image. This process is highly dependent on the chipset, so you may need to Google around a bit.</p><p>The adbd binary is located in the <code>sbin</code> directory of the boot image. The easiest method I've found for extracting and modifying the boot image is with the <a href="https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/tools.html#magiskboot">magiskboot</a> tool. You can find it in the <a href="https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases/">latest Magisk release</a> zip archive. <strong>Note:</strong> you may need to scroll down to find a recent Magisk release, it's not in the manager releases.</p><figure><pre><code>magiskboot unpack boot.img
magiskboot cpio ramdisk.cpio extract</code></pre><figcaption>Extracting the boot image and ramdisk</figcaption></figure><p>Download a copy of <a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/">Ghidra</a> 🐉, create a new project, and import the adbd binary you just extracted. Give it a minute or two to analyze all the code. (if you need Java, try <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html">Amazon's Corretto</a> or <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk11&amp;jvmVariant=hotspot">AdoptOpenJDK</a>)</p><p>I found it much easier to figure out what I was looking at by simultaneously reading the Android <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/refs/tags/android-7.1.2_r39/adb/daemon/main.cpp">source code</a>. As Christian points out in his post, it's easiest to search for the <code>Local port disabled</code> string, or <code>0x7d0</code>, which is the shell user's id in hex. This should bring you to the part of the code where adbd switches from root to the shell user. The goal here is to "comment out" that code, so the program never stops running as root.</p><p>Below is the source code we are trying to target in Ghidra.</p><figure><pre><code>// Don't run as root if running in secure mode.
if (should_drop_privileges()) {
    drop_capabilities_bounding_set_if_needed();
    minijail_change_gid(jail.get(), AID_SHELL);
    minijail_change_uid(jail.get(), AID_SHELL);
    // minijail_enter() will abort if any priv-dropping step fails.
    minijail_enter(jail.get());
    D("Local port disabled");
}</code></pre><figcaption>Android source code</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2020/10/screenshot2-2.PNG" alt="" srcset="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/screenshot2-2.PNG 600w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2020/10/screenshot2-2.PNG 940w"><figcaption>Disassembled / decompiled code (function names renamed to improve readability)</figcaption></figure><p>Basically, we want to remove the calls to <code>minijail_change_gid</code> and <code>minijail_change_uid</code>. This can be done by replacing the bytes with a series of NOP / no operation commands (<code>00 BF</code>).</p><p>Hydra doesn't do a great job at directly modifying ARM binaries, but a generic hex editor should do the trick. I used <a href="https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/">HxD</a>.</p><p>To remove the call to <code>minijail_change_gid</code>, find and replace the following series of bytes:</p><pre><code>4f f4 fa 61 2d f0 3e f9 &lt;- target
00 BF 00 BF 00 BF 00 BF &lt;- replaced with NOPs</code></pre><p>Do the same for <code>minijail_change_uid</code>, and save the patched binary.</p><p>You can use magiskboot to patch your ramdisk, and package up a new boot image. The repack command should create a <code>new-boot.img</code> file, that you can upload back to your Android device.</p><pre><code>magiskboot cpio ramdisk.cpio "add 750 sbin/adbd patched_adbd"
magiskboot repack boot.img</code></pre><p>Assuming all went well, adbd should be running as root!</p><p>Happy hacking 😊</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
    
<p>In this post I want to discuss an issue that I, being for a longer time in IT meanwhile, observe over and over again. It is the observation that as an industry we continuously forget what we have learned.</p>
<p>What do I mean with that claim?</p>
<h2 id="the-very-first-discussion----again-and-again-and-">The very first discussion – again and again and …</h2>
<p>Probably I best illustrate this by sharing an experience I had. About two years ago I attended an unconference. It was not the first time I attended it. I liked it a lot. It always had a very energetic atmosphere. The participants were very active, loved to share and discuss. But unlike the previous times, I decided to do something different that year.</p>
<p>As an experiment, I decided not to share myself, not to offer sessions myself where I drive the topic of discussion, but to listen only. I know that this is not the idea of an unconference, but I was curious. As I wrote: It was a little experiment, I wanted to conduct.</p>
<p>I knew that always a very active group of people gathered at this unconference and I wanted to use that as an unbiased opportunity to learn about the state of IT, how people think about topics, what moves them, and so on. So, I looked forward to what I would learn.</p>
<p>To be frank, it was a devastating experience for me.</p>
<p>The session that really killed it was a session about <a href="https://ufried.com/blog/reusability_fallacy_1/">reusability</a>. A group of people came together to discuss reusability. I was really curious as I dealt with the topic for many years already. A great community. A topic I am particularly interested in. I was looking forward to learning something new. I did not expect a lot of new ideas, but maybe one or two.</p>
<p>So, I listened … and could not believe what I heard.</p>
<p>The discussion moved at a level as if nobody ever had said or written a single word about reusability in the past 50 years. I felt set back to a pre-1968 discussion, set back to a time before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_Software_Engineering_Conferences">NATO Software Engineering Conferences</a> were held. Where had all the ideas about reusability from the 1970s, the 1980s, the 1990s and all the years after gone?</p>
<p>Obviously, nobody in the room ever had heard anything about what we as an industry already had figured out about reusability. They discussed the topic completely from scratch, and due to that in a totally naive way, not touching any of the important learning of the last 50 years. I sat there listening and did not understand what happened. I felt the urge to jump up and scream: “Shut up, all of you! You do not know sh*t about reusability!”</p>
<p>Of course, I did not. Besides the fact that it would have been very rude, it also would have been unfair.</p>
<p>As I wrote before: It was a very active community that gathered there, all of them adding with their best intentions to a vibrant discussion. So, I eventually decided to leave. Not all sessions felt as devastating as this one but I had similar experiences in most of the sessions I attended.</p>
<p>I was quite confused and had a lot to ponder. I went to the conference to learn something new and … well, I learned something new. But it was definitely not what I expected to learn. I learned that the people in the sessions I attended did not seem to have any knowledge about the discussions that we had before in our industry about the very topics.</p>
<h2 id="continuous-collective-amnesia">Continuous collective amnesia</h2>
<p>What happened? It kept me a while thinking. Eventually, I realized that I had observed a disease of our whole industry in its purest form: We continuously forget what we have learned. We always reinvent everything from scratch. My personal observation is that discussions in the IT community start over about every 5 years <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. That is how long we remember as a community. After that we need to rediscover your insights from scratch.</p>
<p>Or how I like to phrase it in a bit provocative way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In IT, we suffer from continuous collective amnesia and we are even proud of it! <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, this is not about the people who discussed in that room. All of them did their best, they eagerly discussed hoping to gather new insights. They were simply victims of a widespread disease in IT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do not value the wisdom of the past.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We suffer from extreme youth obsession, not only regarding the age of people but also regarding how we value knowledge. Old knowledge is considered “worthless”, while new knowledge is considered “great”.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://twitter.com/BitmenStudios/status/1263070511812227072">tweet</a> that Mark, founder of Bitmen Studios sent me in a little conversion we had via Twitter IMO really nicely describes the effect:</p>
<p><img src="https://ufried.com/blog/continuous_amnesia_issue/continuous_amnesia.png" alt="Tweet from Mark, founder of Bitmen Studios: My point here is rather not searching for a unique “best” solution but everywhere software devs across the globe are solving the “same” problem again and again (and fall into the same pitfalls). The increase in tech needed and the associated complexity amplifies that problem." title="We solve the same problems again and again"></p>
<p>We reinvent the wheel over and over again, making the same mistakes again and again, not learning as a community. And as Mark correctly pointed out, the growing technology complexity amplifies the problem – and, as I would like to add, vice versa: Our continuous collective amnesia amplifies our <a href="https://ufried.com/blog/simplify_1/">growing complexity problem</a>.</p>
<p>Why is it this way? Why do we loose our collective memory every 5 years?</p>
<p>I am not sure about the causes. My current attempt of an explanation consists of 5 factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>We consider ourselves a dynamic, fast moving industry. New concepts, tools and technologies emerge every day. How can knowledge of yesterday still be applicable to problems of today? That is what we keep telling ourselves. We wallow in our perceived vigor and speed of innovation, neglecting that we keep solving the same problems over and over again, just with different tools and technologies. Yes, some things change, but usually 80%+ of the problems stay the same. But we refuse to see that. We prefer considering ourselves the “masters of new”.</li>
<li>We are technology believers. We are convinced that we can solve any problem by simply applying the right tool or technology. E.g., if people have a collaboration problem, the typical reflex is to look for a tool that solves the problem, neglecting that it almost certainly is not a tool problem. The same is true for all other kinds of problems. Whenever we face a non-trivial problem, we try to solve it by applying a tool or technology to it instead of solving the actual problem. This has become such a natural pattern that we do not realize it anymore. And as past tools and technologies did not solve the problem, we look for new ones.</li>
<li>Insights grow slower than knowledge. Our knowledge continuously grows, the longer we work in IT. Of course, not everything we learn is valuable. Quite often we learn that some of our knowledge is plain crap. If I, e.g., think back to SOA: Wow, what a crap! Would never do it again this way! But not everything was bad. I also took some great insights from the SOA times. It takes times to separate the wheat from the chaff. In the beginning of our careers we basically learn new stuff all the time. It takes some years until we start to see the recurring patterns, to separate real insights from plain knowledge.</li>
<li>We face a continuous stream of new developers. I feel as if I face a new generation of developers every 5 years <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Maybe that is a very subjective experience. But for me, people just coming from their IT education, being 5 years in business, 10 years or 15 years and more feel very different, like different generations. All those new people in IT have to build their own insights from scratch. They have nothing to build on as in IT we created a cult(ure) of new, celebrating the new and despising the old.</li>
<li>If you combine the “cult of new” with what I call “the arrogance of the youth”, you get an explosive mixture. Before you think that I want to talk bad about younger people: I just talk from personal experience. I was a graduate myself years ago and believe me: I was arrogant! I knew better! I had to learn humbleness the hard way, and I am still not sure if I arrived (it is a lot easier to judge an old self than to judge the current self). So, I do not want to reproach any young person for being somewhat arrogant. I guess that is natural and also healthy to a certain degree because it helps against persisting in outdated ideas as an industry. But in a culture of new, this habit works as an unhealthy accelerant.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we put these factors together, we end up with an environment where we only value new things and despise old things. If we face a problem, we never look if someone solved the same problem before <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. We only look for a shiny new solution, ideally a new tool or technology. If we learn a good solution for a problem, we forget it after a few years and start again from scratch.</p>
<p>It is not that individuals do not learn and do not grow insights. They do.</p>
<p>But as a community, we do not.</p>
<p>Unlike other engineering disciplines, we do not create our body of knowledge, foster our timeless insights, work to extract the essence from the solutions we found yesterday and make it available to the community of today. We do not only not create a body of knowledge, we despise it. We always look to the horizon hoping to spot a silver bullet (which does not exist as we know) instead of looking back once in a while and trying to learn from the wisdom of our ancestors.</p>
<h2 id="moving-on">Moving on</h2>
<p>This is what I observe all the time. Again, this does not mean that I do not meet individuals who act differently. But in general, I see the same discussions recurring again and again about every 5 years.</p>
<p>To be honest, I do not have an actual idea how to change this. This cult of new is so deeply embedded in our culture and self-perception that it would take a long time and effort to change it.</p>
<p>Personally, I try to share some of the old wisdom, e.g., with my talk <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ufried/excavating-the-knowledge-of-our-ancestors">“Excavating the knowledge of the ancestors”</a>. There is also the <a href="https://paperswelove.org/">“Papers We Love”</a> movement that tries to share such knowledge.</p>
<p>But overall this is just a drop in the ocean. It would require a radical rethinking to stop our continuous collective amnesia. We would need to accept that most of our problems are not new, but that most of the times we solve the same problems again and again, just with different technology.</p>
<p>But until we learn this, I am afraid we are not yet an engineering discipline, but rather a bunch of people obsessed with “new”, not learning.</p>
<p>As so often, there would be a lot more to write. But I leave it here. I hope I gave you something to …</p></div></div>

<p>In this book we will work through the motivation and technical details behind <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/differential-dataflow">differential dataflow</a>, a computational framework build on top of <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/timely-dataflow">timely dataflow</a> intended for efficiently performing computations on large amounts of data and <em>maintaining</em> the computations as the data change.</p>
<p>Differential dataflow programs look like many standard "big data" computations, borrowing idioms from frameworks like MapReduce and SQL. However, once you write and run your program, you can <em>change</em> the data inputs to the computation, and differential dataflow will promptly show you the corresponding changes in its output. Promptly meaning in as little as milliseconds.</p>
<p>This relatively simple set-up, write programs and then change inputs, leads to a surprising breadth of exciting and new classes of scalable computation. We will explore it in this document!</p>
<hr>
<p>Differential dataflow arose from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/naiad_sosp2013.pdf">work at Microsoft Research</a>, where we aimed to build a high-level framework that could both compute and incrementally maintain non-trivial algorithms.</p>

<p>Any database schema is likely to have plenty of text fields. In this article, I divide text fields into three categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Small texts</strong>: names, slugs, usernames, emails, etc. These are text fields that usually have some low size limit, maybe even using <code>varchar(n)</code> and not <code>text</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Large texts</strong>: blog post content, articles, HTML content etc. These are large pieces of free, unrestricted text that is stored in the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Medium texts</strong>: descriptions, comments, product reviews, stack traces etc. These are any text field that is between the small and the large. These type of texts would normally be unrestricted, but naturally smaller than the large texts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>In this article I demonstrate the surprising impact of medium-size texts on query performance in PostgreSQL.</strong></p>

<h2 id="understanding-toast"><a href="#understanding-toast">Understanding TOAST</a></h2>
<p>When talking about large chunks of text, or any other field that may contain large amounts of data, we first need to understand how the database handles the data. Intuitively, you might think that the database is storing large pieces of data inline like it does smaller pieces of data, but in fact, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-toast.html" rel="noopener">it does not</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PostgreSQL uses a fixed page size (commonly 8 kB), and does not allow tuples to span multiple pages. Therefore, it is not possible to store very large field values directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the documentation explains, PostgreSQL can't store rows (tuples) in multiple pages. So how does the database store large chunks of data?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] large field values are compressed and/or broken up into multiple physical rows. [...] The technique is affectionately known as TOAST (or “the best thing since sliced bread”).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, so how is this TOAST working exactly?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If any of the columns of a table are TOAST-able, the table will have an associated TOAST table</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So TOAST is a separate table associated with our table. It is used to store large pieces of data of TOAST-able columns (the <code>text</code> datatype for example, is TOAST-able).</p>
<p>What constitutes a large value?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The TOAST management code is triggered only when a row value to be stored in a table is wider than TOAST_TUPLE_THRESHOLD bytes (normally 2 kB). The TOAST code will compress and/or move field values out-of-line until the row value is shorter than TOAST_TUPLE_TARGET bytes (also normally 2 kB, adjustable) or no more gains can be had</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PostgreSQL will try to compress a the large values in the row, and if the row can't fit within the limit, the values will be stored out-of-line in the TOAST table.</p>
<h3 id="finding-the-toast"><a href="#finding-the-toast">Finding the TOAST</a></h3>
<p>Now that we have <em>some</em> understanding of what TOAST is, let's see it in action. First, create a table with a text field:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>toast_test</span> <span>(</span><span>id</span> <span>SERIAL</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span> <span>TEXT</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE TABLE</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The table contains an id column, and a value field of type <code>TEXT</code>. Notice that we did not change any of the default storage parameters.</p>
<p>The text field we added supports TOAST, or is TOAST-able, so PostgreSQL should create a TOAST table. Let's try to locate the TOAST table associated with the table <code>toast_test</code> in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalog-pg-class.html" rel="noopener"><code>pg_class</code></a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>relname</span><span>,</span> <span>reltoastrelid</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>pg_class</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>relname</span> <span>=</span> <span>'toast_test'</span><span>;</span>
<span>  relname   │ reltoastrelid</span>
<span>────────────┼───────────────</span>
<span> toast_test │        340488</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>relname</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>pg_class</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>oid</span> <span>=</span> <span>340488</span><span>;</span>
<span>     relname</span>
<span>─────────────────</span>
<span> pg_toast_340484</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As promised, PostgreSQL created a TOAST table called <code>pg_toast_340484</code>.</p>
<h3 id="toast-in-action"><a href="#toast-in-action">TOAST in Action</a></h3>
<p>Let's see what the TOAST table looks like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>\d</span> <span>pg_toast.pg_toast_340484</span>
<span>TOAST table "pg_toast.pg_toast_340484"</span>
<span>   Column   │  Type</span>
<span>────────────┼─────────</span>
<span> chunk_id   │ oid</span>
<span> chunk_seq  │ integer</span>
<span> chunk_data │ bytea</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The TOAST table contains three columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>chunk_id</code>: A reference to a toasted value.</li>
<li><code>chunk_seq</code>: A sequence within the chunk.</li>
<li><code>chunk_data</code>: The actual chunk data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to "regular" tables, the TOAST table also has the same restrictions on inline values. To overcome this restriction, large values are split into chunks that can fit within the limit.</p>
<p>At this point the table is empty:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>pg_toast</span><span>.</span><span>pg_toast_340484</span><span>;</span>
<span> chunk_id │ chunk_seq │ chunk_data</span>
<span>──────────┼───────────┼────────────</span>
<span>(0 rows)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This makes sense because we did not insert any data yet. So next, insert a small value into the table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>toast_test</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'small value'</span><span>);</span>
<span>INSERT 0 1</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>pg_toast</span><span>.</span><span>pg_toast_340484</span><span>;</span>
<span> chunk_id │ chunk_seq │ chunk_data</span>
<span>──────────┼───────────┼────────────</span>
<span>(0 rows)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>After inserting the small value into the table, the TOAST table remained empty. This means the small value was small enough to be stored inline, and there was no need to move it out-of-line to the TOAST table.</p>

<figcaption>Small text stored inline</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Let's insert a large value and see what happens:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>toast_test</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'n0cfPGZOCwzbHSMRaX8 ... WVIlRkylYishNyXf'</span><span>);</span>
<span>INSERT 0 1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I shortened the value for brevity, but that's a random string with 4096 characters. Let's see what the TOAST table stores now:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>pg_toast</span><span>.</span><span>pg_toast_340484</span><span>;</span>

<p>The large value is stored out-of-line in the TOAST table. Because the value was too large to fit inline in a single row, PostgreSQL split it into three chunks. The <code>\x3063...</code> notation is how psql displays binary data.</p>

<p>Finally, execute the following query to summarize the data in the TOAST table:</p>

<p>As we've already seen, the text is stored in three chunks.</p>
<div>
<p>size of database objects</p>
<p>There are several ways to get the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-DBSIZE" rel="noopener">size of database objects in PostgreSQL</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pg_table_size</code>: Get the size of the table including TOAST, but excluding indexes</li>
<li><code>pg_relation_size</code>: Get the size of just the table</li>
<li><code>pg_total_relation_size</code>: Get the size of the table, including indexes and TOAST</li>
</ul>
<p>Another useful function is <code>pg_size_pretty</code>: used to display sizes in a friendly format.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toast-compression"><a href="#toast-compression">TOAST Compression</a></h3>
<p>So far I refrained from categorizing texts by their size. The reason for that is that the size of the text itself does not matter, what matters is its size after compression.</p>
<p>To create long strings for testing, we'll implement a function to generate random strings at a given length:</p>

<p>We can also provide a set of characters to generate the random string from. For example, generate a string made of 10 random digits:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>generate_random_string</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>'1234567890'</span><span>);</span>

</pre></div>


<p>PostgreSQL TOAST uses the <a href="https://doxygen.postgresql.org/pg__lzcompress_8c_source.html" rel="noopener">LZ family of compression</a> techniques. Compression algorithms usually work by identifying and eliminating repetition in the value. A long string containing fewer characters should compress very well compared to a string made of many different characters when encoded into bytes.</p>
<p>To illustrate how TOAST uses compression, we'll clean out the <code>toast_test</code> table, and insert a random string made of many possible characters:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>TRUNCATE</span> <span>toast_test</span><span>;</span>
<span>TRUNCATE TABLE</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>toast_test</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>generate_random_string</span><span>(</span><span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>10</span><span>));</span>
<span>INSERT 0 1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We inserted a 10kb value made of random characters. Let's check the TOAST table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>chunk_id</span><span>,</span> <span>COUNT</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>chunks</span><span>,</span> <span>pg_size_pretty</span><span>(</span><span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>octet_length</span><span>(</span><span>chunk_data</span><span>)</span><span>::</span><span>bigint</span><span>))</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>pg_toast</span><span>.</span><span>pg_toast_340484</span> <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>1</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>

<span> chunk_id │ chunks │ pg_size_pretty</span>
<span>──────────┼────────┼────────────────</span>
<span>  1495960 │      6 │ 10 kB</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The value is stored out-of-line in the TOAST table, and we can see it is not compressed.</p>
<p>Next, insert a value with a similar length, but made out of fewer possible characters:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>toast_test</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>generate_random_string</span><span>(</span><span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>'123'</span><span>));</span>
<span>INSERT 0 1</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>chunk_id</span><span>,</span> <span>COUNT</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>chunks</span><span>,</span> <span>pg_size_pretty</span><span>(</span><span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>octet_length</span><span>(</span><span>chunk_data</span><span>)</span><span>::</span><span>bigint</span><span>))</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>pg_toast</span><span>.</span><span>pg_toast_340484</span> <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>1</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>

<span> chunk_id │ chunks │ pg_size_pretty</span>
<span>──────────┼────────┼────────────────</span>
<span>  1495960 │      6 │ 10 kB</span>
<span>  1495961 │      2 │ 3067 bytes</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We inserted a 10K value, but this time it only contained 3 possible digits: <code>1</code>, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>. This text is more likely to contain repeating binary patterns, and should compress better than the previous value. Looking at the TOAST, we can see PostgreSQL compressed the value to ~3kB, which is a third of the size of the uncompressed value. Not a bad compression rate!</p>
<p>Finally, insert a 10K long string made of a single digit:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>insert</span> <span>into</span> <span>toast_test</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>values</span> <span>(</span><span>generate_random_string</span><span>(</span><span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>'0'</span><span>));</span>
<span>INSERT 0 1</span>

<span>FROM</span> <span>pg_toast</span><span>.</span><span>pg_toast_340484</span> <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>1</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>

<span> chunk_id │ chunks │ pg_size_pretty</span>

<span>  1495961 │      2 │ 3067 bytes</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The string was compressed so well, that the database was able to store it in-line.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><b>Binary lambda calculus</b> (<b>BLC</b>) is a minimal, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional" title="Purely functional">pure</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming_language" title="Functional programming language">functional programming language</a> invented by John Tromp in 2004,<sup id="cite_ref-RAC_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-RAC-1">[1]</a></sup> based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_encoding" title="Binary encoding">binary encoding</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untyped_lambda_calculus" title="Untyped lambda calculus">untyped lambda calculus</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_index" title="De Bruijn index">De Bruijn index</a> notation.</p>



<h2><span id="Background">Background</span></h2>
<p>BLC is designed to provide a very simple and elegant concrete definition of descriptional complexity (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity" title="Kolmogorov complexity">Kolmogorov complexity</a>).</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, the complexity of an object is the length of its shortest description.</p>
<p>To make this precise, we take descriptions to be bitstrings, and identify a description method with some computational device, or machine, that transforms descriptions into objects. Objects are usually also just bitstrings, but can have additional structure as well, e.g., pairs of strings.</p>
<p>Originally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine" title="Turing machine">Turing machines</a>, the most well known formalism for computation, were used for this purpose. But they are somewhat lacking in ease of construction and composability. Another classical computational formalism, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus" title="Lambda calculus">Lambda calculus</a>, offers distinct advantages in ease of use. The lambda calculus doesn't incorporate any notion of I/O though, so one needs to be designed.</p>
<h2><span id="Binary_I.2FO">Binary I/O</span></h2>
<p>Adding a readbit primitive function to lambda calculus, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaitin" title="Chaitin">Chaitin</a> did for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LISP" title="LISP">LISP</a>, would destroy its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency_(computer_science)" title="Referential transparency (computer science)">referential transparency</a>, unless one distinguishes between an I/O action and its result, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)" title="Haskell (programming language)">Haskell</a> does with its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)" title="Monad (functional programming)">monadic</a> I/O. But that requires a type system, an unnecessary complication.</p>
<p>Instead, BLC requires translating bitstrings into lambda terms, to which the machine (itself a lambda term) can be readily applied.</p>
<p>Bits 0 and 1 are translated into the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Logic_and_predicates" title="Lambda calculus">lambda booleans</a> <i>B</i><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;= True and <i>B</i><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;= False:</p>

<p>which can be seen to directly implement the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If-then-else" title="If-then-else">if-then-else</a> operator.</p>
<p>Now consider the pairing function</p>

<p>Applying this to a boolean yields the desired component of choice.</p>

</dl>
<p>The <i>z</i> works as a list continuation, that could be a nil list (to end the string) or another string (that would be appended to the original string).</p>
<h2><span id="Delimited_versus_undelimited">Delimited versus undelimited</span></h2>
<p>Descriptional complexity actually comes in two distinct flavors, depending on whether the input is considered to be delimited.</p>
<p>Knowing the end of your input makes it easier to describe objects. For instance, you can just copy the whole input to output. This flavor is called <i>plain</i> or <i>simple</i> complexity.</p>
<p>But in a sense it is additional information. A file system for instance needs to separately store the length of files. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" title="C (programming language)">C language</a> uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_character" title="Null character">null character</a> to denote the end of a string, but this comes at the cost of not having that character available within strings.</p>
<p>The other flavor is called <i>prefix</i> complexity, named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_code" title="Prefix code">prefix codes</a>, where the machine needs to figure out, from the input read so far, whether it needs to read more bits. We say that the input is self-delimiting. This works better for communication channels, since one can send multiple descriptions, one after the other, and still tell them apart.</p>
<p>In the I/O model of BLC, the flavor is dictated by the choice of <i>z</i>. If we keep it as a free variable, and demand that it appears as part of the output, then the machine must be working in a self-delimiting manner. If on the other hand we use a lambda term specifically designed to be easy to distinguish from any pairing, then the input becomes delimited. BLC chooses <i>False</i> for this purpose but gives it the more descriptive alternative name of <i>Nil</i>. Dealing with lists that may be Nil is straightforward: since</p>

<p>We can find a description method <i>U</i> such that for any other description method <i>D</i>, there is a constant <i>c</i> (depending only on <i>D</i>) such that no object takes more than <i>c</i> extra bits to describe with method <i>U</i> than with method <i>D</i>. And BLC is designed to make these constants relatively small. In fact the constant will be the length of a binary encoding of a <i>D</i>-interpreter written in BLC, and <i>U</i> will be a lambda term that parses this encoding and runs this decoded interpreter on the rest of the input. <i>U</i> won't even have to know whether the description is delimited or not; it works the same either way.</p>
<p>Having already solved the problem of translating bitstrings into lambda calculus, we now face the opposite problem: how to encode lambda terms into bitstrings?</p>
<h2><span id="Lambda_encoding">Lambda encoding</span></h2>
<p>First we need to write our lambda terms in a particular notation using what is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_indices" title="De Bruijn indices">De Bruijn indices</a>. Our encoding is then defined recursively as follows</p>

<p>A <b>closed</b> lambda term is one in which all variables are bound, i.e. without any free variables. In De Bruijn format, this means that an index <i>i</i> can only appear within at least <i>i</i> nested lambdas.

<p>In March, as Covid-19 began sending office workers home across the globe, Facebook realized it had a serious problem. The company relies on a vast army of <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/facebook-international-content-moderators/">content moderators</a><strong> </strong>— often low-paid contractors — who are responsible for removing everything from nudity to hate speech and terrorism content. Their work is often sensitive and, therefore, can’t be done outside a formal office. As the world went into lockdown, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s CEO, <a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/March-18-2020-Press-Call-Transcript.pdf">said</a> during a press call that the social network would lean more on full-time staffers and artificial intelligence to police its platforms.</p>



<p>But, he noted, some of this work would “still be done by teams in person.” One of those teams is located thousands of miles away from the company’s California headquarters in Hyderabad, India, where, as of last year, <a href="https://www.medianama.com/2019/08/223-facebook-contractor-genpact-doubles-minimum-salaries-for-content-moderators-in-india-report/">1,600 Facebook moderators</a> were employed by a third-party contractor called Genpact. This summer, even as Covid-19 cases were surging in India, Genpact moderators said they felt pressured by their employer to come back to the office. While most of Facebook’s full-time employees remain safe at home, these workers have been forced to choose between their health and their livelihoods: stemming the tide of the most unsavory and disturbing posts on the internet.</p>



<p><em>Rest of World </em>spoke with four current and former Genpact employees, all of whom asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal from the company. They said moderators were asked — in some cases as early as July — to return to the office to tackle sensitive content, including posts involving child exploitation, suicide, and other matter that could lead to real-world harm. Two moderators said that Genpact pressured workers to show up at Facebook’s office in HITEC City, a corporate district home to some of India’s biggest tech companies. Two moderators also reported that Genpact is continuing to shift more employees to work on Facebook content.</p>



<p>In a statement, Genpact said it couldn’t comment on specific relationships with clients, but it asserted that moderators are being asked to come into the office on only a volunteer basis. “To make this manageable, safe, and clear, employees need to sign a weekly form that asks them to voluntarily agree to this,” a spokesperson for the company said in an email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Facebook also asserted that moderators are working in person only if they choose the option and that most are still doing their jobs from home. “Our focus for reopening any office is on how it can be done in a way that keeps our reviewers safe,” a spokesperson for Facebook said in a statement. “To do this we are putting strict health and safety measures in place, making sure they’re followed, and addressing and disclosing any confirmed cases of illness.”</p>



<p>With few opportunities for other work, the moderators who spoke to <em>Rest of World</em> said they still felt like they had no choice but to show up in person. A senior moderator said that Genpact employees were also informed they could lose their jobs if they didn’t come to the office. “The operations team told them these are important orders,” said the moderator. “There’s a threatening factor behind [it].”</p>



<p>“People are forced to go to work, even if they are not happy to,” they added. Genpact denied that it incentivizes anyone to work in person. The company emphasized that coming into the office “is voluntary, and we remind each employee that their decision has no impact on benefits, pay, or status.” </p>



<p>In the middle of a pandemic and subsequent recession, it’s not clear where the Genpact moderators would go if they lost their jobs. “During Covid times, many companies are holding off on new recruitments,” said R. Chandra Sekharam, a commissioner with the Labour Department of Telangana, the Indian state where Hyderabad is located.</p>



<p>In March, an IT company that shares an office building with Facebook made a grim announcement: one of its employees had tested positive for the coronavirus. Fears of contracting Covid-19 soon swept the city. Hostel owners and other landlords in Hyderabad, afraid that tenants working in large offices would bring the virus home with them, began evicting people who work in business process outsourcing (BPO) and telecommunications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to two Genpact moderators, that included some of their colleagues working for Facebook. When they reached out to Genpact asking for help finding a new place to live, one employee said the plea fell on deaf ears. “There’s no help being given by the company,” they told <em>Rest of World</em>. Genpact denied the claim and said it worked with authorities to stop evictions and offered some people alternative housing.</p>





<p>Just two days after that first case of Covid-19 was announced, Genpact employees were asked to return to work in Facebook’s office, according to one moderator who was called back. In May, the<em> </em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/05/18/facebook-google-work-from-home/"><em>Washington Post</em></a><em> </em>reported that Facebook had offered extra pay to moderators in the U.S. who voluntarily agreed to return to work. The Genpact workers told <em>Rest of World</em> that no such bonus was extended to them in India.</p>



<p>Before the pandemic, the moderators said that their salaries, which amount to less than $2 an hour, were supplemented by food benefits, received either in the form of in-office meals or through a prepaid meal card. One moderator described the perk as coming directly from Facebook. But when Genpact employees were sent home during India’s Covid-19 lockdown, the benefit disappeared. During an internal Facebook meeting leaked to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444203/facebook-leaked-audio-zuckerberg-trump-pandemic-blm"><em>The Verge</em></a><em> </em>in September, Zuckerberg fielded a question from a staffer at the company’s California headquarters, who complained about the lack of free snacks available while they worked from home. But for reviewers in India, meal benefits were more than just a cushy perk: They were a crucial supplement to their low incomes. (Genpact says that it is continuing to provide packed meals and snacks for on-site workers.)</p>

<p>Moderators who have returned to Facebook’s office in Hyderabad say they are unhappy but also afraid of losing their jobs. “Calling people in [to work] in such situations is completely unprofessional,” one former moderator told <em>Rest of World</em>. That person left Genpact after being sent home in March but remains in contact with former coworkers. “Genpact is doing it because there aren’t any jobs, and people are getting laid off. So people are too scared to actually say anything. And I think that’s what Genpact is taking advantage of.”</p>



<p>Contractors, unlike Facebook’s full-time employees, have almost no leverage to demand changes to their working conditions, says Paul Barrett, deputy director of New York University’s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. Despite accounting for a core part of Facebook’s business, contract moderators “are viewed as replaceable cogs in a machine,” he says.</p>



<p>Facebook has also been criticized for its treatment of domestic content moderators. In May, the company agreed to pay <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/12/854998616/in-settlement-facebook-to-pay-52-million-to-content-moderators-with-ptsd">$52 million</a> to settle a class action lawsuit filed by reviewers in the U.S., who alleged the traumatic nature of their work led to mental health issues, like post-traumatic stress disorder. Facebook admitted no wrongdoing, but as part of the settlement, the company vowed to improve labor conditions. Yet contractors have continued to report problems, particularly during the pandemic. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497789/facebook-content-moderators-accenture-return-office-coronavirus"><em>The Verge</em></a> reported that Facebook moderators at the third-party firm Accenture said they were ordered to report to their offices in Austin, Texas, without any explanation or extra pay. (Facebook said the work done by the Austin team can’t be done from home.)</p>



<p>Mithun Roy, a managing consultant at the outsourcing firm Avaya, says that companies like Genpact can charge more for employees who work directly from a client’s office than from an outsourcing site. When clients like Facebook request a firm’s services, Roy says they have to be as detailed as possible, including disclosing where the work will be performed. According to Roy, a yearlong contract from a client like Facebook can be worth millions of dollars.</p>



<p>“Management doesn’t want to miss this opportunity,” the senior Genpact moderator told<em> Rest of World</em>. That person said the company has been pushing moderators to work on-site at Facebook’s Hyderabad office even as Covid-19 cases have skyrocketed in the city, in order to gain an advantage over competitors less comfortable sending workers in person. “Even after the pandemic ends, this could [mean] new workstreams for us,” the senior moderator said.</p>



<p>Genpact and Facebook aren’t the only entities pushing contractors in Hyderabad to return to normal. The city’s economy is increasingly reliant on business from multinational tech companies. It’s been home to Microsoft’s regional headquarters since 1998, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/business/amazon-hyderabad-india.html">the largest Amazon office</a> in the world opened there last year. As the pandemic progressed, and many workers left the city for their hometowns, officials began fearing that <a href="https://www.livemint.com/industry/infotech/lay-offs-loom-over-it-sector-in-hyderabad-telangana-govt-urges-centre-to-act-11588317514170.html">Hyderabad’s tech industry would soon experience massive layoffs</a>.</p>

<p>Hyderabad went into lockdown on March 22. Officials began allowing <a href="https://qz.com/india/1834746/some-tcs-infosys-wipro-staff-go-to-work-amid-coronavirus/">IT workers to return to the office less than two months later on May 1</a>, and some even sooner. During India’s lockdown and subsequent reopening, IT companies were considered “essential” by the government, allowing them to skirt certain coronavirus regulations placed on other businesses. According to a state minister in Hyderabad, this designation predates the pandemic: It’s meant as a guarantee to multinational companies that their outsourced workforces won’t be disrupted.</p>



<p>Activists and health care workers <a href="https://www.newsclick.in/COVID-19-Telangana-Govt-Grossly-Under-Reporting-Cases-Activists">have warned</a> that the state of Telangana “vastly” underreported cases of Covid-19 and deaths related to the virus.

Or you have no deadline at all.</p><p>How do you do great work every day instead of the usual last-minute push before a deadline?<br>A vitally important question in the era of knowledge work.</p><h3>The mythical land of Q2, the important but not urgent</h3><p>This post is all about the Q2 of the Eisenhower matrix - the part that many procrastinators never get around to.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/eisenhower_Q2.png" alt="Eisenhower Matrix"></p><p>It's a shame because Q2 is where all the future-focused, strategic work lies: learning new skills, investing into new endeavors, working on new branches of a business,...</p><p><strong>Q2 is the quadrant of potential.</strong></p><p>Without spending time in Q2 frequently, we tread water in life, doing only the things that we've always done, or that we're forced into at the last minute. Just enough to get by, but not to go to bed with a sense of pride.</p><p>Let's change this.</p><p>We'll start with the first obstacle to working on non-urgent important tasks—the reactive habit of&nbsp;<em>checking</em>.</p><h2>Why checking things became a default habit</h2><p>If you have Internet access, you probably developed this simple habit:</p><p><em>When I get bored, I check ___________.</em></p><p>This is a problem.</p><p>Work often isn't engaging at the beginning of a session. It can seem onerous, never-ending, and boring (before you get into the problem-solving mode).</p><p>If you always have an easy way to get distracted, you'll take it. Often.</p><p>When you&nbsp;<em>check</em>&nbsp;a site or app, you get a bit of dopamine - a feel-good neurochemical.</p><p>This dopamine hit makes it addictive to check stuff. Just the possibility of something new, random, or unexpected is exciting, even if that new thing ends up being a work email.</p><p>Checking things is the cornerstone of&nbsp;<strong>a reactive work style:</strong></p><ul><li>You never do something unless it's in reply to someone else.</li><li>You wait for others to remind you multiple times to do something.</li><li>You refresh inboxes constantly and keep them open at all times.</li><li>When you find yourself bored, you immediately check something.</li></ul><p><strong>This way of working is devoid of initiative. It's an addiction to new information disguised as being "responsive."</strong></p><p>Nothing non-urgent ever gets done.</p><p>How can we get ourselves to do it?</p><h2>2 ways to do non-urgent work</h2><p>The first way is to make Q2 feel like Q1 - to make it urgent. There's a variety of ways to do it.</p><p>The second way is to choose to work on Q2 because you can.</p><h2>1. Make Q2 feel like Q1</h2><p>When we're on a deadline, we spring into action.</p><p>The consequences of not acting become clear: we'll get fired, fail a class, or ruin a relationship...</p><p>The fear of these scenarios is visceral. It drives us to finally get things done.</p><p>While reliance on this fear is not ideal, we can use it.</p><h3>Create consequences for your actions (or lack thereof)</h3><p>If you know that without a deadline, you don't work, create deadlines.</p><p>There are many ways of doing this:</p><ul><li><strong>Tell your coworker you'll do something.</strong><br>If you tell a coworker that you'll have done something by Tuesday, they will expect you to deliver. If you don't, you'll cause them to be disappointed or angry. That's a clear consequence.</li><li><strong>Promise publicly you'll do something.</strong><br>If you promise on social media or any other public forum that you'll do something by a certain time, you're putting your reputation at risk.</li><li><strong>Schedule an event you don't want to miss.</strong><br>If it's 3PM and you schedule a fancy dinner with your partner at 6PM, it becomes clear that you have only the next 3 hours to get things done (unless you want to miss the dinner). Having more events in your schedule highlights the space available for work. If there's little time for delays, you'll probably adapt and not delay.</li><li><strong>Sign up for&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.stickk.com/">Stickk</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.beeminder.com/">Beeminder.</a></strong><br>Both of these services allow you to make a financial bet against yourself. They also help you put your goals into a concrete format. Losing your own money if you don’t do something can be a powerful motivating force.</li></ul><p>Besides these ways of creating a deadline for yourself, you can also heighten your awareness of not working when you're meant to.</p><h3>Create a crystal clear sense of "Now I focus"</h3><p>When a deadline is looming over us, we feel this visceral feeling of "now I really need to work."</p><p>Suddenly, every available hour is an hour we can use to work. Having so much to do and so little time to do it makes us use every minute.</p><p>In other words, it becomes crystal clear to us that&nbsp;<strong>now is the time to focus.</strong></p><p>We can use other tools to get to that feeling.</p><h4>Work alongside others</h4><p>Our environment shapes our behavior in a profound way. Imagine you're working next to a coworker who's focusing intensely. They can also see your screen when they occasionally glance away from their work.</p><p>Would that inspire you to focus a bit more?</p><p>The research says yes.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/497818?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">One study</a>&nbsp;found that the presence of another person improves performance by 16-32%. Interestingly, the study notes: "low productivity workers are the most sensitive to the behavior of peers."</p><p>Now, if you can't use this in your physical environment and work with your coworker, or partner, you can use a service like&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.focusmate.com/">Focusmate.</a></p><p>It allows you to work with 50 minute sessions with others who want to focus on their work.</p><p>You can try the service for free and see if it helps you.</p><h4>Make a grand gesture</h4><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/tips/hotel.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="5 Star hotel"></p><p>A slightly more esoteric way of boosting your awareness of "now I work" is to make a grand gesture.</p><p>Cal Newport describes this strategy in Deep Work and uses the example of J K Rowling.</p><p>When Rowling was stuck writing The Goblet of Fire, she decided to check into a 5 star hotel.</p><p>A stay in a hotel like that is expensive. You can spend hundreds of dollars every day.</p><p>For Rowling, the whole purpose of staying in that hotel was to write.

 <p>In the past (and occasionally in the present in some companies), we used to do lots of manual grunt work setting up our infrastructure. A typical approach to launching an infrastructure involved raising tickets to your data center provider and waiting for them to execute your request. A system administrator grabs the ticket and generally uses a management portal of some sort, and starts clicking away at different configuration menus until your infrastructure is deployed and provisioned.</p>

<p>This approach has worked fine for many data centers that didn’t frequently change for a long time. These companies would have virtual machines that stayed up for months or even years that didn’t scale as often.</p>

<p>Since then, infrastructure has transitioned into the cloud with companies like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, and many others, giving us a complete infrastructure as a service platform. Instead of having someone else provision the infrastructure for us, we have all the necessary tools required to deploy our infrastructure in the cloud. Despite having the tools provided by these companies, we still have to rely on manual infrastructure provisioning, which creates room for mistakes and more things to forget.</p>

It allows you to define your data center’s desired state and overall topology in a definition file, then uses your definition files to feed into software to provision and deploy your infrastructure, giving you very consistent and predictable environments. The benefits of infrastructure as code are many, and there is very little reason not to use it. Here are just a few of the ways Iac can help you.</span></p>

<p>Since everything is in a definition file for each infrastructure piece, Iac gives you a repeatable process with reusable components. Repeatable in the sense that you can now deploy that exact infrastructure on different platforms and environments. Reusability gives you the ability to deploy and reuse the same definition files across multiple project infrastructures. For example, if you have a web server with a specific configuration, you can use that configuration combined with other infrastructure pieces to make your task much more straightforward.</p>

<p>Finally, Since your infrastructure is code, you can commit the changes to source control software like Git, giving you the ability to track and version the change history and the evolution of your infrastructure over time. Source control also allows multiple team members to work together on the same infrastructure in a distributed way, and it keeps track of who changed what to the infrastructure.</p>

<p>Now that we understand what Iac is and why it’s important let’s talk about the two types of Iac configurations. As we’ve mentioned before, Iac uses configuration languages like YAML, JSON, HCL, and others. There are two main types of Iac configuration styles. Declarative and Imperative.</p>

<p>Imperative style is a way of writing configurations for an Iac software using a detailed and procedural set of instructions to provision your infrastructure. It needs to know the steps and the order in which it should create the infrastructure. That’s probably a bit hard to understand, so let me explain it with a pizza example.</p>

<p>Software that uses declarative configuration comes preconfigured to perform routine tasks. All you have to do is declare your desired state, and the software will take care of the rest. You don’t have to give it step by step instructions on what it should do since the software already understands how to perform your task and in which order.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Terraform is an open-source declarative style infrastructure as code software created by HashiCorp. It uses a declarative style syntax known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). Terraform uses a push-based model to make changes to your infrastructure, which means that Terraform does not require you to install an agent software running on the infrastructure to use it. All you need is the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terraform CLI tool installed</a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;on your machine, with the credentials or token of your cloud provider, and you’re good to go. Terraform is not limited to cloud providers only and can also provision on-premises infrastructures like OpenStack and VMware. It can work with Platform as a Service (PaaS) like Heroku, Kubernetes, and AWS Lambda functions. Finally, Terraform works equally well with Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms like DataDog, CDNs such as Fastly, and even Github.</span></p>

<p>Terraform is idempotent, meaning when you run a command using Terraform to deploy a piece of infrastructure, it remembers the state. If you try to run the same configuration, it will not make any changes keeping everything in-tact and preventing accidental modifications of your infrastructure. If we reuse our pizza example, suppose you asked for Terraform to make you a pizza, and it does, then you ask it again, it will tell you, “I already gave you a pizza” unless you specify you want a new pizza Terraform won’t make it.</p>

You can install these providers in the form of plugins that Terraform can use to interact with your infrastructure provider. Plugins make Terraform highly extensible, allowing it to work with any provider.</span></p>

<p>Finally, once Terraform has provisioned your resources, it creates a state file that contains your current infrastructure’s state. Terraform can then keep track of the changes that happen over time. For example, if you have updates to your infrastructure Terraform will compare those changes and apply only the essential differences between your new changes and your current infrastructure state.</p>

<p>Terraform has two fundamental pieces that make it work, the core and providers. The core is the part of Terraform that understands your configuration and manages your infrastructure’s state definition files. It handles all lifecycle related management, such as planning creating, updating, as well as destroying your infrastructure. The second part is the providers. Providers are how Terraform connects to the outside world, such as AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean, and Azure.</p>

<p>One of the most underappreciated features introduced since Go version 1.8 is the Go plugin package. Plugins are one of the many software architectural designs that allow you to build loosely coupled and modular programs. In Go, plugins are written and compiled separately as shared objects (.so) or libraries and can be loaded dynamically during runtime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Incorporating extensibility into your programs is always considered a good practice, and there are many approaches to this. However, the current plugin package in Go does come with its fair share of headaches. Below is a side-by-side table listing the Go plugins’ pros and cons in its current state.</p>

<p>The basic shipping calculator will give you rates based on which shipping method and parcel weight you provide. You can support different shipping methods by adding new plugins, and the calculator will produce the rates and currency based on your preferred shipping method. The interface for a shipping method contains three functions, GetCurrency,&nbsp; CalculateRate, and Name.</p>

        <p>Last updated Feb. 3, 2014 — read <span id="post-views">25572</span> times</p>

        <p><strong>This post is adapted from <a href="https://mikeknoop.com/iowaconf-road-to-zapier">a talk I gave</a> at <a href="http://iowaconf.com/">iowaconf</a> October 2013</strong></p>

<p>I was one of three co-founders of <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>. If you're unfamiliar with the origin story, we got started out of a <a href="http://columbia.startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend</a> in Columbia, Mo. in 2011.</p>

<p>The prompt for this talk was to describe “what you learned building Zapier”. The most obvious thing I could share is tactical advice or early anecdotes. Things like how we got our first dozen customers to pay us before we really had a product or how we almost missed our acceptance call into <a href="https://ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a>.</p>

<p>And to be clear, I'm still leaning <em>a ton</em> through today. Startups are very much “trial-by-fire” as a first-time founder.</p>

<p>But the more I thought about that talk prompt, I realized the biggest thing I learned actually began way, way earlier. It's a lesson that applies equally to launching Zapier as to endeavors which lie beyond.</p>



<p>Growing up I've was always into tech and I loved building things (I originally wanted to be an architect when I thought that's what they did).</p>

<p>I learned how to build websites after borrowing a friend's “Learn HTML in 24 Hours” book. My goal was to build an AOL Instant Messenger profile for myself, which conveniently, could render actual HTML.</p>

<p>Later I learned how to code “hardcore” by picking up assembly language. I did this so I could write TI-83+ calculator games and play them during class (much to the dismay to my teachers growing up).</p>

<p>Towards the end of high school though, it was time to pick a major. Computer Science was the obvious shoe-in. But I didn't want to do it! I feared that I would burn out and not have time/energy for side projects.</p>

<p>So I decided instead to do Mechanical Engineering instead – also maybe not the best choice considering my goal outlined above but at least I wouldn't be coding 24/7 for school.</p>



<p>Facebook was just taking off during my freshman year of college. They launched their original developer platform that fall and I was instantly hooked.</p>

<p>I spent a good chunk of free time building apps. Like this one that you could use to request phone numbers from your fiends.</p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/e5f24a618be311e3ae7628cfe91e44cb.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Or this one which was a developer toolkit, making it easy to embed Facebook-style form elements.</p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/e45bf5828be311e3b0bb28cfe91e44cb.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Or even my last solo Facebook endeavor, a monitoring tool for the Facebook Platform, which peaked at a grand total of 1 paying user.</p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/e35826a88be311e3982b28cfe91e44cb.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can probably guess: my ROI wasn't too great. But I was very active in the Facebook developer community and made a name for myself. Facebook reached out and asked if I'd like to become a community moderator. I have to imagine this was because of my community participation and not because they looked at any of my app analytics. </p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/e5897b478be311e3a69228cfe91e44cb.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This moderator gig led me to write developer columns for Inside Facebook and in combination, these two things generally kept my around the platform much longer than I otherwise should have.</p>

<p>It did turn out to be useful though.</p>



<p>I was applying for summer engineering internships after my Junior year of college. I applied about two dozen engineering firms in Missouri as well as a few web development gigs.</p>

<p>Of all resume's I sent out I only heard back from one place, <a href="http://veteransunited.com/">Veterans United</a>, a VA loan lender based in Columbia Mo. I learned they wanted to build an app for military personnel to reconnect inside of Facebook.</p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/e4ebb0e88be311e3864128cfe91e44cb.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I worked on Military Basebook for about a year. It peaked around 20,000 monthly active users but ultimately wasn't sticky enough. Around this time I learned a few things:</p>

<p><em>1. Facebook apps that aren't games just don't work well</em></p>

<p>Even today the most successful apps on Facebook are games. Users on Facebook just aren't in mindset to seek out utilities.</p>

<p><em>2. I didn't want to do the traditional engineering career</em></p>

<p>Although the sentiment had been brewing for a while, that summer was a turning point where I actively decided I would focus on side projects post college instead of seeking a full time job. I was going to keep throwing stuff at the wall and see if something stuck.</p>

<p>I began my mechanical engineering masters program (which I ended up dropping out of) as part of this strategy. I was able to secure a 2-year grant which paid for school living expenses. This left me with a lot of free time for my side projects.</p>



<p>Around the middle of my junior year I discovered <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. If you're unfamiliar, it is a lot like Reddit (HN actually came first) where stories and articles are upvoted to the frontpage. Usually people post about programming and startups.</p>

<p>One convention on Hacker News is called “Show HN” which is a way for people to show off their side projects and solicit feedback.</p>

<p>One “Show HN” caught my eye by a user called <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/?user=phpnode">phpnode</a> (thank you phpnode!). He launched a side project called <a href="http://zpr.io/6dM7.png">Hackernewsers</a> which was a map of users who used Hacker News.</p>

<p>The idea was simple. You submit your username, real name, and location and you get access to a map where you can see others who've done the same. I checked out Columbia Mo. and I saw something interesting – there was someone else in the area! It turns out that other person was this guy:</p>

<p>[Bryan Helmig]</p>

<p>I remember clicking through all the information I could find online about him. I found his <a href="http://bryanhelmig.com/">personal blog</a>, some of his <a href="http://rankiac.com/">side projects</a>, and even <a href="http://youtube.com/">his YouTube channel</a>. But the most important thing I learned was that he worked at same company I did, <a href="http://veteransunited.com/">Veterans United</a>.</p>

<p>That was enough of a connection for me so I got in touch over Facebook. We met up several times that year for beers and wanted to work on something together.</p>



<p>Mizzou, the university I attended in Columbia, sent out a weekly email with things happening on campus and in the area. I usually auto-archived these. I must have been pretty bored the day I <a href="http://google.com/">opened this one</a>, but I'm glad I did. I found an enticing headline “Startup Weekend is Coming to Columbia”.</p>

<p>I had never heard of Startup Weekend but I knew I liked building things, I knew I liked startups, so maybe this is something I wanted to be a part of. I then discovered tickets cost $50 and was a bit turned off.</p>

<p>Maybe if I could find someone else going, it would be worth the money. So I messaged Bryan and he said he was going! I bought tickets later that night, and that's how I wound up at Columbia Missouri's first ever Startup Weekend.</p>

<p>At Startup Weekend I formally met <a href="http://wadefoster.net/">Wade Foster</a> who also happened to work at Veterans United. We got together and worked on the project that Bryan originally pitched as “API Mixer”. The idea was simple: make a tool that enables anyone (marketers, sales, HR, developers) to connect together two web services they use.</p>

<p>In true startup fashion we took to the back garage and got to work. The <a href="https://zapier.com/blog">story of Zapier</a> is still being written today.</p>



<p>When I look back on the decisions that lead me to Startup Weekend I am amazed how many times the proverbial train of life could have been derailed.</p>

<p>What if I hadn't opened that email? What if I never got into Facebook development? What if I hadn't worked at Veterans United?</p>

<p>In reminds me a lot of the game Plinko on The Price is Right. The one where the contestant drops the puck down a pegged board and it randomly makes it's way down to one of the buckets at the bottom with the winning bucket in the middle.</p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/9ed525578be311e39e8a28cfe91e44cb.png" alt="Plinko"></p>

<p>The funny thing about plinko is, if you run sufficiently many trials, the middle bucket is actually the easiest to hit! The outcome follows a normal distribution.</p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/9dfcebde8be311e3ae7b28cfe91e44cb.png" alt="Plink Distrobution"></p>

<p>The take away here is if you go through life making random decisions, statistically, you'll wind up in the middle. While in Plinko the middle is the best, in reality, the really exciting stuff happens at the edges of the board. That's where Zapier happened. And to get there you've got to purposely push yourself towards the outsides.</p>

<p>Although I didn't realize it at the time, there was a guiding principle for all my decisions. I was always putting myself out there, in uncomfortable, new situations that challenged my own status quo.</p>

<p>That's the road to the outside of the Plinko board. And that's the biggest thing I learned by creating Zapier.</p>

					<p>Deze week hebben we een stap gezet waarvan we dachten dat we hem nooit zouden moeten zetten: we hebben de NOS-logo`s laten verwijderen van de auto`s waarmee we elke dag op pad zijn om verslaggevers een werkplek te bieden en om radio- en televisieverbindingen met Hilversum te leggen. Voortaan zijn deze auto`s, kleine vrachtwagens eigenlijk, niet meer herkenbaar als auto`s van de NOS.</p>										<p>Helaas, het is nodig voor de veiligheid van de mensen die elke dag voor de NOS op pad zijn. We hebben er maanden over getwijfeld, we wilden het per se niet, want we willen als publieke journalistieke organisatie juist zichtbaar en aanspreekbaar zijn, maar het kan zo niet verder.</p>
<p>Vrijwel dagelijks worden collega`s die onderweg zijn, geconfronteerd met opgestoken middelvingers, er wordt afval naar ze gegooid, ze worden afgesneden op de snelweg en een enkeling remt zelfs hard vlak voor onze auto`s. Als zo`n NOS-auto stil staat om in te werken, wordt dat onmogelijk gemaakt door erop te bonzen. Als we worden uitgescholden en of in meer of mindere mate bedreigd, valt dat al bijna niet meer op.</p>
<p>En het gaat niet alleen om wat er feitelijk gebeurt, maar zeker ook om de angst dat je wat overkomt of wordt aangedaan.</p>
<p>Eerder namen we het besluit standaard bewaking meesturen als we verslag doen van publieksmanifestaties en nu dan de logo`s eraf. Zo diep zijn we gezonken en het verbijsterende is: het is allemaal in korte tijd snel anders geworden. Deze discussie kwam in het voorjaar op, maar toen nog zeiden de technici dat ze logo`s zeker niet kwijt wilden. Herkenbaarheid en trots op het bedrijf waar ze voor werken, gaven toen nog de doorslag.</p>
<p>De journalistiek ligt onder vuur van mensen en groeperingen, die alleen hun eigen wereld willen terugzien, elk ander perspectief onmogelijk proberen te maken en daarmee de persvrijheid aantasten. Dit besluit is een nederlaag voor de NOS, maar vooral voor de journalistiek. Bij <a href="https://www.persveilig.nl/">Persveilig</a> zijn binnen een jaar meer dan 100 meldingen van agressie tegen journalisten binnengekomen. De journalistiek is een fundament voor onze democratie, moet onbelemmerd kunnen functioneren en daarin gesteund worden. Juist nu en veel meer dan gebeurt.</p>

<p><span>[Updated on 2018-09-30: thanks to Yoonju, we have this post translated in <a href="https://github.com/yjucho1/articles/blob/master/fromGANtoWGAN/readme.md">Korean</a>!]</span>
<br>
<span>[Updated on 2019-04-18: this post is also available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08994">arXiv</a>.]</span></p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf">Generative adversarial network</a> (GAN) has shown great results in many generative tasks to replicate the real-world rich content such as images, human language, and music. It is inspired by game theory: two models, a generator and a critic, are competing with each other while making each other stronger at the same time. However, it is rather challenging to train a GAN model, as people are facing issues like training instability or failure to converge.</p>

<p>Here I would like to explain the maths behind the generative adversarial network framework,  why it is hard to be trained, and finally introduce a modified version of GAN intended to solve the training difficulties.</p>



<h2 id="kullbackleibler-and-jensenshannon-divergence">Kullback–Leibler and Jensen–Shannon Divergence</h2>

<p>Before we start examining GANs closely, let us first review two metrics for quantifying the similarity between two probability distributions.</p>

<p>(1) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence">KL (Kullback–Leibler) divergence</a> measures how one probability distribution \(p\) diverges from a second expected probability distribution \(q\).</p><p>

\[D_{KL}(p \| q) = \int_x p(x) \log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} dx\]

</p><p>\(D_{KL}\) achieves the minimum zero when \(p(x)\) == \(q(x)\) everywhere.</p>

<p>It is noticeable according to the formula that KL divergence is asymmetric. In cases where \(p(x)\) is close to zero, but \(q(x)\) is significantly non-zero, the \(q\)’s effect is disregarded. It could cause buggy results when we just want to measure the similarity between two equally important distributions.</p>

<p>(2) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%E2%80%93Shannon_divergence">Jensen–Shannon Divergence</a> is another measure of similarity between two probability distributions, bounded by \([0, 1]\). JS divergence is symmetric (yay!) and more smooth. Check this <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-isnt-the-Jensen-Shannon-divergence-used-more-often-than-the-Kullback-Leibler-since-JS-is-symmetric-thus-possibly-a-better-indicator-of-distance">Quora post</a> if you are interested in reading more about the comparison between KL divergence and JS divergence.</p><p>

\[D_{JS}(p \| q) = \frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(p \| \frac{p + q}{2}) + \frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(q \| \frac{p + q}{2})\]

</p><p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/KL_JS_divergence.png" alt="KL and JS divergence"></p>
<p><em>Fig. 1. Given two Gaussian distribution, \(p\) with mean=0 and std=1 and \(q\) with mean=1 and std=1. The average of two distributions is labelled as \(m=(p+q)/2\). KL divergence \(D_{KL}\) is asymmetric but JS divergence \(D_{JS}\) is symmetric.</em></p>

<p>Some believe (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.05101.pdf">Huszar, 2015</a>) that one reason behind GANs’ big success is switching the loss function from asymmetric KL divergence in traditional maximum-likelihood approach to symmetric JS divergence. We will discuss more on this point in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="generative-adversarial-network-gan">Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)</h2>

<p>GAN consists of two models:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A discriminator \(D\) estimates the probability of a given sample coming from the real dataset. It works as a critic and is optimized to tell the fake samples from the real ones.</li>
  <li>A generator \(G\) outputs synthetic samples given a noise variable input \(z\) (\(z\) brings in potential output diversity). It is trained to capture the real data distribution so that its generative samples can be as real as possible, or in other words, can trick the discriminator to offer a high probability.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/GAN.png" alt="Generative adversarial network"></p>
<p><em>Fig. 2. Architecture of a generative adversarial network. (Image source: <a href="http://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/01/generative-adversarial-networks-hot-topic-machine-learning.html">www.kdnuggets.com/2017/01/generative-…-learning.html</a>)</em></p>

<p>These two models compete against each other during the training process: the generator \(G\) is trying hard to trick the discriminator, while the critic model \(D\) is trying hard not to be cheated. This interesting zero-sum game between two models motivates both to improve their functionalities.</p>

<p>Given,</p>

      <td>Data distribution over real sample \(x\)</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>On one hand, we want to make sure the discriminator \(D\)’s decisions over real data are accurate by maximizing \(\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{r}(x)} [\log D(x)]\). Meanwhile, given a fake sample \(G(z), z \sim p_z(z)\), the discriminator is expected to output a probability, \(D(G(z))\), close to zero by maximizing \(\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_{z}(z)} [\log (1 - D(G(z)))]\).</p>

<p>On the other hand, the generator is trained to increase the chances of \(D\) producing a high probability for a fake example, thus to minimize \(\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_{z}(z)} [\log (1 - D(G(z)))]\).</p>

<p>When combining both aspects together, \(D\) and \(G\) are playing a <strong>minimax game</strong> in which we should optimize the following loss function:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\min_G \max_D L(D, G) 
&amp; = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{r}(x)} [\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)} [\log(1 - D(G(z)))] \\
&amp; = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{r}(x)} [\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_g(x)} [\log(1 - D(x)]
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>(\(\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{r}(x)} [\log D(x)]\) has no impact on \(G\) during gradient descent updates.)</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-optimal-value-for-d">What is the optimal value for D?</h3>

<p>Now we have a well-defined loss function. Let’s first examine what is the best value for \(D\).</p><p>

\[L(G, D) = \int_x \bigg( p_{r}(x) \log(D(x)) + p_g (x) \log(1 - D(x)) \bigg) dx\]

</p><p>Since we are interested in what is the best value of \(D(x)\) to maximize \(L(G, D)\), let us label</p><p>

\[\tilde{x} = D(x), 
A=p_{r}(x), 
B=p_g(x)\]

</p><p>And then what is inside the integral (we can safely ignore the integral because \(x\) is sampled over all the possible values) is:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
f(\tilde{x}) 
&amp; = A log\tilde{x} + B log(1-\tilde{x}) \\

\frac{d f(\tilde{x})}{d \tilde{x}}
&amp; = A \frac{1}{ln10} \frac{1}{\tilde{x}} - B \frac{1}{ln10} \frac{1}{1 - \tilde{x}} \\
&amp; = \frac{1}{ln10} (\frac{A}{\tilde{x}} - \frac{B}{1-\tilde{x}}) \\
&amp; = \frac{1}{ln10} \frac{A - (A + B)\tilde{x}}{\tilde{x} (1 - \tilde{x})} \\
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>Thus, set \(\frac{d f(\tilde{x})}{d \tilde{x}} = 0\), we get the best value of the discriminator: \(D^*(x) = \tilde{x}^* = \frac{A}{A + B} = \frac{p_{r}(x)}{p_{r}(x) + p_g(x)} \in [0, 1]\).</p>

<p>Once the generator is trained to its optimal, \(p_g\) gets very close to \(p_{r}\). When \(p_g = p_{r}\), \(D^*(x)\) becomes \(1/2\).</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-global-optimal">What is the global optimal?</h3>

<p>When both \(G\) and \(D\) are at their optimal values, we have \(p_g = p_{r}\) and \(D^*(x) = 1/2\) and the loss function becomes:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
L(G, D^*) 
&amp;= \int_x \bigg( p_{r}(x) \log(D^*(x)) + p_g (x) \log(1 - D^*(x)) \bigg) dx \\
&amp;= \log \frac{1}{2} \int_x p_{r}(x) dx + \log \frac{1}{2} \int_x p_g(x) dx \\
&amp;= -2\log2
\end{aligned}\]

</p><h3 id="what-does-the-loss-function-represent">What does the loss function represent?</h3>

<p>According to the formula listed in the <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2017/08/20/from-GAN-to-WGAN.html#kullbackleibler-and-jensenshannon-divergence">previous section</a>, JS divergence between \(p_{r}\) and \(p_g\) can be computed as:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
D_{JS}(p_{r} \| p_g) 
=&amp; \frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(p_{r} || \frac{p_{r} + p_g}{2}) + \frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(p_{g} || \frac{p_{r} + p_g}{2}) \\
=&amp; \frac{1}{2} \bigg( \log2 + \int_x p_{r}(x) \log \frac{p_{r}(x)}{p_{r} + p_g(x)} dx \bigg) + \\&amp; \frac{1}{2} \bigg( \log2 + \int_x p_g(x) \log \frac{p_g(x)}{p_{r} + p_g(x)} dx \bigg) \\
=&amp; \frac{1}{2} \bigg( \log4 + L(G, D^*) \bigg)
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>Thus,</p><p>

\[L(G, D^*) = 2D_{JS}(p_{r} \| p_g) - 2\log2\]

</p><p>Essentially the loss function of GAN quantifies the similarity between the generative data distribution \(p_g\) and the real sample distribution \(p_{r}\) by JS divergence when the discriminator is optimal. The best \(G^*\) that replicates the real data distribution leads to the minimum \(L(G^*, D^*) = -2\log2\) which is aligned with equations above.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Other Variations of GAN</strong>: There are many variations of GANs in different contexts or designed for different tasks. For example, for semi-supervised learning, one idea is to update the discriminator to output real class labels, \(1, \dots, K-1\), as well as one fake class label \(K\). The generator model aims to trick the discriminator to output a classification label smaller than \(K\).</p>

<h2 id="problems-in-gans">Problems in GANs</h2>

<p>Although GAN has shown great success in the realistic image generation, the training is not easy; The process is known to be slow and unstable.</p>

<h3 id="hard-to-achieve-nash-equilibrium">Hard to achieve Nash equilibrium</h3>

<p><a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6125-improved-techniques-for-training-gans.pdf">Salimans et al. (2016)</a> discussed the problem with GAN’s gradient-descent-based training procedure. Two models are trained simultaneously to find a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium">Nash equilibrium</a> to a two-player non-cooperative game. However, each model updates its cost independently with no respect to another player in the game. Updating the gradient of both models concurrently cannot guarantee a convergence.</p>

<p>Let’s check out a simple example to better understand why it is difficult to find a Nash equilibrium in an non-cooperative game. Suppose one player takes control of \(x\) to minimize \(f_1(x) = xy\), while at the same time the other player constantly updates \(y\) to minimize \(f_2(y) = -xy\).</p>

<p>Because \(\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x} = y\) and \(\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial y} = -x\), we update \(x\) with \(x-\eta \cdot y\) and \(y\) with \(y+ \eta \cdot x\) simulitanously in one iteration, where \(\eta\) is the learning rate. Once \(x\) and \(y\) have different signs, every following gradient update causes huge oscillation and the instability gets worse in time, as shown in Fig. 3.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Previously I’ve decided to implement a rather basic <a href="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/posts/2020-06-04-simple-ray-casting-with-clojurescript/">raycasting engine in ClojureScript</a>.
It was a lot of fun, an interesting experience, and ClojureScript was awesome.
I’ve implemented small <a href="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/posts/2020-06-04-simple-ray-casting-with-clojurescript/#labyrinth-game">labyrinth game</a>, and thought about adding more features to the engine, such as camera shake, and wall height change.
But when I’ve started working on these, I quickly understood, that I’d like to move on to something more interesting, like real 3D rendering engine, that also uses rays.</p>
<p>Obviously, my first though was about writing a ray-tracer<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.
This technique is wide known, and gained a lot of traction recently.
With native hardware support for ray tracing, a lot of games are using it, and there are a lot of tutorials teaching how to implement one<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.
In short, we cast a bunch of rays in 3D space, and calculate their trajectories, looking for what ray will hit and bounce off.
Different materials have different bounce properties, and by tracing rays from camera to the source of light, we can imitate illumination.
There are also a lot of different approaches how to calculate bouncing, e.g. for global illumination, and ambient light, but I’ve felt that it is a rather complicated task, for a weekend post.
And unlike raycasting, most ray-tracers require polygonal information in order to work, where raycasting only need to know wall start and end points.</p>
<p>I’ve wanted a similar approach for 3D rendering, where we specify an object in terms of it’s mathematical representation.
Like for sphere, we’ll just specify coordinate of a center, and a radius, and our rays will find intersection points with it, providing us a sufficient data to draw this sphere on screen.
And recently, I’ve read about a similar technique, that uses rays for drawing on screen, but instead of casting infinite rays as in raycasting, it marches a ray in terms of steps.
And it also uses a special trick, to make this process very optimized, therefore we can use it for rendering real 3D objects.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to structure this post similarly to the one about raycasting, so this will be another long-read, often more about Fennel rather than raymarching, but at the end I promise that we’ll get something that looks like this:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/end-result.png"> 
</figure>

<p>So, just as in raycasting, first we need to do is to understand how raymarching engine works <em>on paper</em>.</p>
<h2 id="raymarching-basics">Raymarching basics</h2>
<p>Raymarching can be illustrated similarly to raycaster, except it requires more steps until we could render our image.
First, we need a camera, and an object to look at:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/camera-and-circle.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>Our first step would to cast a ray, however, unlike with raycasting, we’ll cast a portion of a ray:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/camera-and-circle-short-ray.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>We then check, if the ray intersects with the sphere.
It’s not, so we do one more step:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/camera-and-circle-two-steps.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>It’s not intersecting yet, so we repeat again:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/camera-and-circle-ray-overshoot.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>Oops, ray overshoot, and is now inside the sphere.
This is not really good option for us, as we want for our rays to end directly at the object’s surface, without calculating intersection point with the object itself.
We can fix this by casting shorter ray:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/camera-and-circle-small-rays.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>However, this is very inefficient!
And besides, if we’ll change the angle a bit or move the camera, we will overshoot again.
Which means that we’ll either have incorrect result, or require a very small step size, which will blow up computation process.
How we can fix this?</p>
<h3 id="distance-estimation">Distance estimation</h3>
<p>The solution to this is a signed distance function, or a so called Distance Estimator.
Imagine if we knew how far we are from the object at any point of time?
This would mean that we can shoot a ray of this length in any direction and still don’t hit anything.
Let’s add another object to the scene:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/scene-with-two-objects.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>Now, let’s draw two circles, which will represent distances from the objects, to the point from where we’ll cast rays:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/distances.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>We can see, that there are two circles, and one is bigger than another.
This means, that if we choose the shortest safe distance, we can safely cast ray in any direction and not overshoot anything.
For example, let’s cast a ray towards the square:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/ray-in-safe-zone.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>We can see, that we haven’t reached the square, but more importantly we did not overshoot it.
Now we need to march the ray again, but what distance should it cover?
To answer this question, we need to take another distance estimation from ray end to the objects in the scene:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/second-safe-march.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>Once again we choose shorter distance, and march towards the square, then get the distance again, and repeat the whole process:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/another-safe-match.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>You can see that with each step the distance to the object becomes smaller, and thus we will never overshoot the object.
However this also means, that we will take a lot of really small steps, until we finally fully hit the object, if we ever do.
This is not a good idea, because it is even more inefficient than using fixed distance, and produces too accurate results, which we don’t really need.
So instead of marching up until we exactly hit the object, we will march <em>enough</em> times.
E.g. until the distance to the object is small enough, then there’s no real point to continue marching, as it is clear that we will hit the object soon.
But this also means, that if the ray goes near the edge of an object, we do a lot of expensive steps of computing distance estimations.</p>
<p>Here’s a ray that is parallel to the side of the square, and marches towards the circle:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/expensive-marching.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>We do a lot of seemingly pointless measurements, and if a ray was closer to the square’s side, we would do even more steps.
However this also means, that we can use this data (since we’re already computed it) to render such things as glow, or ambient occlusion.
But more on this later.</p>
<p>Once ray hit an object we have all the data we need.
Ray represents a point on the screen, and the more rays we cast the higher resolution of our image will be.
And since we’re not using triangles to represent objects, our spheres will always be smooth, no matter how close we are to it, because there’s no polygons involved.</p>
<p>This is basically it.
Ray marching is quite simple concept, just like raycaster, although it’s a bit more complicated, as we do have to compute things in 3D space now.
So let’s begin implementing it by installing required tools, and setting up the project.</p>
<h2 id="project-structure">Project structure</h2>
<p>As you know from the title we will use two main tools to create ray-marcher, which are <a href="https://love2d.org/">LÖVE</a>, a free game engine, and <a href="https://fennel-lang.org/">Fennel</a> the programming language.
I’ve chosen Fennel, because it is a Lisp like language, that compiles to Lua, and I’m quite a fan of Lisps.
But we also needed to draw somewhere, and I know no GUI toolkit for Lua.
But there is LÖVE - a game engine that runs Lua code, which is capable on running on all systems, thus a perfect candidate for our task.</p>
<p>Installation steps may differ per operating system, so please refer to manuals<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.
At the time of writing this post I’m using Fedora GNU/Linux, so for me it means:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">$ sudo dnf install love luarocks readline-devel
$ luarocks install --local fennel
$ luarocks install --local readline <span># requires readline-devel</span>
$ <span>export</span> <span>PATH</span>=<span>"</span><span>$PATH</span><span>:</span><span>$HOME</span><span>/.luarocks/bin"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>It’s better to permanently add <code>$HOME/luarocks/bin</code> (or another path, if your installation differs) to the <code>PATH</code> variable in your shell, in order to be able to use installed utilities without specifying full path every time.
You can test if everything is installed correctly, by running <code>fennel</code> in you command line.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">$ fennel
Welcome to Fennel 0.5.0 on Lua 5.3!
Use (doc something) to view documentation.
&gt;&gt; (+ 1 2 3)
6
&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>For other distributions installation steps may vary, and for Windows, I think it’s safe to skip the <code>readline</code> part, which is fully optional, but makes editing in a REPL a bit more comfortable.</p>
<p>Once everything is installed, let’s create the project directory, and the <code>main.fnl</code> file, where we will write our code.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">$ mkdir love_raymarching
$ <span>cd</span> love_raymarching
$ touch main.fnl
</code></pre></div><p>And that’s it!
We can test if everything works by adding this code to <code>main.fnl</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>fn </span><span>love.draw</span> []
  (<span>love.graphics.print</span> <span>"It works!"</span>))
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can compile it with <code>fennel --compile main.fnl &gt; main.lua</code>, thus producing the <code>main.lua</code> file, and run <code>love .</code> (dot is intentional, it indicates current directory).</p>
<p>A window should appear, with white text <code>It works!</code> in upper left corner:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/love-works.png"> 
</figure>

<p>Now we can begin implementing our raymarcher.</p>
<h2 id="scene-setup">Scene setup</h2>
<p>Just as in raycaster, we need a camera that will shoot rays, and some objects to look at.
Let’s begin by creating a camera object, that will store coordinates and rotation information.
We can do so, by using <code>var</code> to declare a variable that is local to our file, and that we can later change with <code>set</code><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>var </span><span>camera</span> {<span>:pos</span> [0.0 0.0 0.0]
             <span>:x-rotate</span> 0.0
             <span>:z-rotate</span> 0.0})
</code></pre></div><blockquote>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Lisps, and especially Clojure, let me quickly explain what this syntax is.
If you know this stuff, feel free to <a href="#org6f2d291">skip this part</a>.</p>
<p>We start by using a <code>var</code> special form, that binds a value to a name like this: <code>(var name value)</code>.
So if we start the REPL, using <code>fennel</code> command in the shell, and write <code>(var a 40)</code>, a new variable <code>a</code> will be created.
We then can check, that it has the desired value by typing <code>a</code>, and pressing return:</p>
<p>We can then alter the contents of this variable by using <code>set</code> special form, which works like this <code>(set name new-value)</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>&gt;&gt;</span> (<span>set </span><span>a</span> (<span>+ </span><span>a</span> 2))
<span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
42
</code></pre></div><p>Now to curly and square brackets.
Everything enclosed in curly braces is a hashmap.
We can use any Lua value as our key, and the most common choice is a string, but Fennel has additional syntax for defining keys - a colon followed by a word: <code>:a</code>.
This is called a keyword, and in Fennel it is essentially the same as <code>"a"</code>, but we don’t need to write a pair of quotes.
However keywords can’t contain spaces, and some other symbols.</p>
<p>So writing this <code>{:a 0 :b 2 :c :hello}</code> in the REPL will make a new table, that holds three key value pairs, which we can later get with another syntax - the dot <code>.</code>.
Combining it with <code>var</code>, we can see that it works:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>&gt;&gt;</span> (<span>var </span><span>m</span> {<span>:a</span> 1 <span>:b</span> 2 <span>:c</span> <span>:hello</span>})
<span>&gt;&gt;</span> (<span>. </span><span>m</span> <span>:b</span>)
2
</code></pre></div><p>There’s also a shorthand for this …</p></blockquote></article></div>

<p><em>This article is based on a book chapter from my upcoming book <strong>“From One to Zero: A Minimalistic Approach to Programming”</strong>. </em></p>



<p>My <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/subscribe/" title="Subscribe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">programming students</a> often write in with their struggles and failures. Many students ultimately overcome their struggles—but a large percentage of them <strong><em>give up their programming ambitions</em></strong> after realizing how hard creating software can be. These students started with the goal of becoming professional coders, but, ultimately, they missed that target. </p>



<p>After thousands of personal conversations with these students, it became apparent that many new coders don’t fail because they don’t know one or the other Python feature or because they lack technical skills, intelligence, or even talent. </p>



<p>These are not the underlying reasons <strong><em>why </em></strong>they fail. </p>



<p>Instead, they fail because they are<strong> overwhelmed by the complexity lurking everywhere in programming</strong>. The complexity causes them to throw in the towel. This is unfortunate because there are many ways to mitigate the harmful effects of complexity in programming. In the previous chapter, you’ve already learned some strategies about the <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/the-80-20-principle-in-programming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="The 80/20 Principle in Programming"><strong>80/20 principle</strong></a> (Focus on the vital few and sacrifice the trivial many!).</p>



<p>In this chapter, we’re going to have a comprehensive look at this important and highly underexplored topic. <strong>What exactly is complexity?</strong> Where does it occur? How does it look like?</p>



<p>Let’s start with a quick overview—there’s significant complexity in selecting the right</p>



<ul><li>programming language among dozens of popular languages,</li><li>coding project to work on—from thousands of open-source projects and myriads of problems,</li><li>libraries within a language (<a href="https://blog.finxter.com/why-does-the-scikit-learn-library-use-a-trailing-underscore-convention-for-attribute-names/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="Why Does the Scikit-learn Library use a Trailing Underscore Convention for Attribute Names?">scikit-learn</a> vs <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/numpy-tutorial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="NumPy Tutorial – Everything You Need to Know to Get Started">NumPy </a>vs <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/2-min-computer-science-papers-tensorflow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="[2-min CS Papers] A Short Introduction to the TensorFlow System">TensorFlow</a>),</li><li>emerging technologies to “bet on”—Alexa apps, smartphone apps, browser-based web apps, integrated Facebook or WeChat apps, virtual reality apps—and</li><li><a href="https://blog.finxter.com/best-python-ide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="Best Python IDE and Code Editors [Ultimate Guide]">coding editor</a> such as PyCharm, IDLE, and Atom.</li></ul>



<p>Given the great confusion caused by these sources of complexity, it’s no surprise that<strong><em> “How to start?”</em></strong> is one of the most common questions from programming beginners. </p>



<p>To answer the question right away, the best way to start is <strong><em>not </em></strong>by choosing a programming book and reading over all <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/python-crash-course/" title="Python Programming Tutorial [+Cheat Sheets]" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">syntactical features</a> of the programming language. Surprisingly, these coding books sell well—even I am a<a href="https://coffeebreakpython.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://coffeebreakpython.com/"> seller of such books</a>. However, interacting with thousands of programming students personally I realized that many ambitious students buy programming books as a commitment device to put the learning task on their ToDo lists—if they’ve spent money on the book, they better read it or the investment will be lost. But as so many other tasks on their ToDo lists, reading a programming book is seldomly one to be completed. </p>



<p><strong>Many students buy these programming tutorial books but very few actually read them.</strong></p>



<p>So, what is the <strong><em>best way to start to learn to program</em></strong>? In my opinion, the best way to start is to choose a practical code project—a simple one if you’re a beginner—and push it to completion. </p>



<ul><li>Don’t read coding books before you do this. </li><li>Don’t read random tutorials on the web. </li><li>Don’t scroll through endless feeds on StackOverflow. </li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Just set up the project and start coding with the limited skills you have</em></strong> and your common sense. </p>



<p>It’s okay if you don’t understand what you’re doing, you will gradually increase your understanding. You read books and articles only to make progress on the project in front of you. By diving into the process of finishing your first project, you need to solve a number of highly relevant problems: </p>



<ul><li><a href="https://blog.finxter.com/best-python-ide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="Best Python IDE and Code Editors [Ultimate Guide]">Which code editor should you use? </a></li><li><a href="https://blog.finxter.com/install-python-win/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="How to Install Python on Windows? [7 Easy Steps]">How to install Python? </a></li><li><a href="https://blog.finxter.com/how-to-read-all-lines-of-a-file-in-a-python-one-liner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="How to Read All Lines of a File in a Python One-Liner?">How to read input from a file? </a></li><li>How to store the input in your program for later use? </li><li>How to manipulate the input to obtain the desired output?</li></ul>



<p>By answering these questions, you gradually build a well-rounded skill set of a practitioner. Over time, you’ll answer these questions better and better. Your speed and skill to solve these problems will grow. You’ll be able to solve similar problems much bigger and you’ll create your internal database of programming patterns and conceptual insights. Even advanced coders learn and improve with the exact same process—only the coding projects have become much larger and more complicated.</p>



<p>Let’s assume you adopt this <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/how-to-start-your-freelancing-business-on-the-side/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="[7 Steps] How to Start Your Freelancing Business on the Side?">project-based learning approach</a>. You focus on a single project and work on it for a considerable amount of time. What is your biggest enemy now? You guessed it: <strong><em>complexity</em></strong>.</p>



<p>You’ll struggle with complexity in:</p>



<ul><li>finding bugs in ever-growing codebases,</li><li>understanding code components and how they interact,</li><li>choosing the right feature to be implemented next,</li><li>understanding the mathematical and conceptual basics of the code.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Complexity is everywhere</strong>, at every stage of a project that comes to life. And the hidden costs of this complexity are very tangible: coders who are just starting out throw in the towel and the projects never see the light of day. The beginner argues: <em>“coding is too difficult for me”</em> and he truly believes it—even though nothing can be further from the truth.</p>



<p>The root of the problem is overwhelming complexity and a lack of focus. So, the question arises: </p>



<p><strong><em>How to solve complexity and a lack of focus?</em></strong></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/509922/pexels-photo-509922.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" data-src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/509922/pexels-photo-509922.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" alt="Minimalism" width="844" height="563" data-old-src="//blog.finxter.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif"></figure></div>



<p>The answer is straightforward, and I’ve already stressed it a few times in this book: <strong>minimalism</strong>. Seek simplicity and focus – in every stage of the coding cycle. I want you to take this one concept out of the book: Take a radically minimalistic position in every area you’ll encounter in the programming space. If this book can convince you to take more extreme measures to increase your focus, it has accomplished its mission!</p>



<p>Let’s dive deeper into the concept of complexity to develop an understanding of one of the great enemies of your coding productivity.</p>




<h2><span id="What_is_Complexity"></span>What is Complexity?<span></span></h2>



<p>In different fields, the term complexity comes with different meanings. Sometimes, it’s strictly defined, such as in computational complexity of a computer program that provides a means to analyze a given code function for varying inputs. Other times, it’s loosely defined as the amount or structure of interactions between system components. But in this book, we’re going to use it in a more generic way.</p>



<p>The Merriam Webster dictionary defines complexity as <em>“something complex”</em>. The term complex is defined as <em>“a whole made up of complicated […] parts”</em>. If you resolve the term complicated—<em>“difficult to analyze, understand, or explain”</em>—you end up with the following rough definition:</p>



<p><strong>Complexity</strong>: <em>“a whole, made up of parts, that is difficult to analyze, understand, or explain”</em>.</p>



<p>This is how we use the term complexity in this book. Complexity describes a whole system or entity. It is difficult to explain or describe. Because of its difficulty, complexity causes struggle and confusion. When confronted with complexity, people find themselves cognitively unable to comprehend the deeper meaning, implications, or effects of “the whole”.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4183195/pexels-photo-4183195.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" data-src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4183195/pexels-photo-4183195.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" alt="Complexity" width="450" height="563" data-old-src="//blog.finxter.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif"></figure></div>



<p>They cannot see the big picture—complexity is the enemy of clarity, closure, and predictability, because a complex system behaves in highly unpredictable ways. Where do you find complexity? You’ll find it everywhere, because real-world systems are messy: A highly interrelated web of causes and effects that obfuscates the behavior of a real system, and that is impossible to decode for individuals who are themselves caught in this complex web. Like a differential equation, the output of one system feeds into another system’s input which, in turn, feeds back into the first system as an input. Examples of highly complex systems are the stock market, social trends, emerging political viewpoints, and big computer programs with hundreds of thousands of lines of code—such as the Windows operating system.</p>



<p>If you are a coder, you are especially prone to overwhelming complexity. Let’s dive into different sources of complexity in the field of programming:</p>



<ul><li>Complexity in a Project Lifecycle</li><li>Complexity in Software and Algorithmic Theory</li><li>Complexity in Learning</li><li>Complexity in Processes</li><li>Complexity in Social Networks</li><li>Complexity in Your Daily Life</li><li>Complexity in a Project Lifecycle</li></ul>



<p>The best way to learn and create lasting value is through your participation or initiation of a real-world project. But how does it look like when a real-world project comes to life? Let’s dive into the different stages of the project lifecycle: Planning, Defining, Designing, Building, Testing, and Deployment (see Figure 1).</p>



<p><em><strong>Figure 1</strong>: A software project comes to life – the project lifecycle consists of six conceptual phases: Planning, Defining, Designing, Building, Testing, Deployment.</em></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="604" height="340" src="https://blog.finxter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-182.png" data-src="https://blog.finxter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-182.png" alt="" data-srcset="https://blog.finxter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-182.png 604w, https://blog.finxter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-182-300x169.png 300w, https://blog.finxter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-182-150x84.png 150w" data-sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" data-old-src="//blog.finxter.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" srcset="https://blog.finxter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-182.png 604w, https://blog.finxter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-182-300x169.png 300w, https://blog.finxter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-182-150x84.png 150w"></figure></div>



<p>Figure 1 shows the software development life cycle consisting of six phases. Even if you’re working on a very small software project, you’re likely going through all six phases of the software development lifecycle. Next, you’ll quickly dive into all six phases—and how complexity has a significant impact on every one of them.</p>



<h3><span id="Planning"></span>Planning<span></span></h3>



<p>The first stage of the software development life cycle is the planning phase. From software engineering literature, you may know this as <strong><em>requirement analysis</em></strong>. The purpose of this phase is to determine how the end product will look like. A successful planning phase leads to a strictly defined set of required features to deliver to the customer or the end user.</p>



<p>The planning phase solves a multi-dimensional problem where different departments and functions must collaborate to determine the optimal set of features of the software. A number of factors must be taken into consideration: the costs of building a feature, the risk of not being able to successfully implement the feature, the expected value for the end user, marketing and sales implications, maintainability, scalability, legal restrictions and many more.</p>



<p>This phase is crucial because it can save you from massive wastages of downstream energy in the following phases. Business owners know that <strong><em>capital allocation</em></strong> (or …</p></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h3>Pursuing a non-conventional path</h3><p>Between 2015 and 2020 I have participated in <a href="https://quantopian.com/">Quantopian</a> and <a href="https://numer.ai/">Numerai</a> tournaments. Being involved in these tournaments has led me to a <strong>very profitable journey</strong>: I made around $350k during these years.</p><p>Many people have reached out to me and asked how I did it. I decided to write this post to inspire others with this <strong>non-conventional path</strong>.</p><h4>Selling a Trading Algorithm</h4><p>In 2015 <strong>algorithmic trading</strong> was one of my interests. This is how I came across <a href="https://quantopian.com/">Quantopian</a>, a platform that provides data and tools so anyone can develop and test trading algorithms. After learning the basics and playing around with the platform I decided to submit an algorithm to their recently created tournament.</p><p>The algorithm was pretty basic but surprisingly it remained in the <strong>top 10 for a few weeks</strong>. I received many messages: companies suggesting to join them as a Financial Quant, people interested in my approach, and a few offers from people interested in buying the algorithm.</p><p>One of those potential buyers was particularly interested, shockingly enough, even after I explained him how simple my algorithm was. I eventually shared the code with him for free. Still, he expressed his desire to send me the amount he offered in the first instance. And that's how I made <strong>the first $2k out of participating in ML/financial tournaments.</strong></p><h4>Getting The Dream Job</h4><p>During these weeks I exchanged many emails with Apple employees, financial quants, people from Europe, Asia, or America. But the best interaction came from a guy from my town. He was building his own trading algorithm and was interested in my approach. I meet him a couple of times. Obviously, his knowledge was years ahead of where I was at that time.</p><p>Those meetings were very productive, especially for me. After discussing with him about our personal and professional interests, and how difficult it was to find good jobs in our city, he introduced me to my next employer. Of course, I was not aware of it at that time. He introduced me to the CEO of an ad-tech company, and at first glance I saw many things in common between this sector and <strong>high-frequency trading</strong>. The offered position (not publicly opened at that time) would also allow me to face and try to solve many machine learning, big data and architectural challenges.</p><p>After a few weeks and a couple of meetings, I decided that the company was a really good fit, a place where I would continue professionally growing and developing as a <strong>data scientist and engineer</strong>.</p><p>During years we worked on building a solid <strong>platform that led us to be acquired in 2018</strong>. The experience was great and the outcome even better. Including the exit bonus I made a big sum during this period.</p><h4>The Altcoins Trading Madness</h4><figure><img src="https://i.ibb.co/5c9snCN/Cf-DCZLm-WEAACt-ZS.jpg" alt="Numerai Tournament Leaderboard"></figure><p>In 2016, I discovered the <a href="https://numer.ai/tournament">Numerai Tournament</a>, "the hardest data science tournament on the planet" as they claim. Numerai is a weekly global <strong>data science tournament</strong> to solve the stock market. Data scientists work with clean, regularized, and obfuscated datasets provided by Numerai to create machine-learning models to predict the stock market. <a href="https://numer.ai/">Numerai</a> builds a meta model of the most unique and contributive predictions, and uses this to command the capital in its global equity hedge fund.</p><p>In early 2016 I had finished a <strong>few rounds in good spots</strong>, as you can see in the image. After a few months of actively participating, I ended 2016 with around 0.5 BTC. It was cool but it required too much of my time. I had other priorities, so I withdrew the earnings and left the tournament.</p><p>Almost a year later a post about a Numerai airdrop came across my timeline. After login back to my account I discovered I received 1800 NMR.</p><p>At that time, the amount was valued around $30k, so I initially decided to withdraw almost everything, but something changed my mind and I started <strong>buying and selling altcoins</strong>. After some back and forth, and some lucky movements, I ended accumulating a wallet valued around $100k.</p><p>2017 was arriving at his end and I took <strong>the last lucky movement</strong>, I withdrew half of that sum a few weeks before the bitcoin crash. I still hold the other half but it wasn't easy to stick to that decision during 2018, while cryptos prices continued decreasing.</p><h4>The Compound Effect</h4><p>In July 2018, I came back to Numerai Tournament. I made some submissions but I didn't take it seriously again until mid-2019.</p><p>Since then I have a <strong>cumulative return of +141%</strong>. I have built an algorithm with an average weekly return of +2%, which taking into account the compounding effect it translates to <strong>+180% annualized total return</strong>.</p><h4>What's next?</h4><p>I'm going to continue participating in the Numerai Tournament, if everything continues as it is now, it would provide a good income without requiring much effort. I will also continue taking <strong>small bets</strong>, experimenting with other projects, continue doing things I like, and <strong>learning in the process</strong>.</p><p>I share similar histories in Twitter, you can <a href="https://twitter.com/jrdi">follow me there</a> as I continue to document my journey.</p></div></div></div>]]>

October 20, 2020 | https://blog.ueber.io/post/monetizing-open-source/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.ueber.io/post/monetizing-open-source/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>We double down on our open source projects without knowing how we make money with it. Open source software is accessible for free, so how can we make it sustainable? Let’s look at what could work.</p>
<p>Too many open source projects die because developers burn out to deliver fantastic software in their free time. That’s not how it should be, so what’s the alternative? We researched the topic and concluded there is not that one answer to the question.</p>
<p>What works for you depends on your project’s type, what you want to do, who you develop the software for, and many more things. Here is a list of ideas you can try or even combine to make money with your open source projects. Hopefully, that helps you to free more time for the things you love to work on.</p>
<h2 id="donations">Donations</h2>
<p>People are kind, so why not adding a donate button to your README? That’s an easy way to get a little money for your work. Unfortunately, that didn’t work for us. We asked for donations for our work on tiptap, a popular package that took us a few hundred hours to develop.</p>
<p>Hundreds of developers, companies, and even a few big corporations use it, but we earned less than $300 through PayPal donations over the last three years. Don’t get me wrong, we are very thankful for every dollar, but this makes an hourly rate of less than $1. That’s not sustainable, and not enough to work less on client projects and more on the bespoken project.</p>
<h2 id="licenses">Licenses</h2>
<p>Your source code can stay open source, but add a license that requires people to pay for permission to use it in their projects. And to keep it fair, you can exclude non-commercial projects, non-profit organizations, students, and other open source projects.</p>
<p>Note, it might be hard to enforce the license for publicly accessible source code.</p>
<h2 id="goodwill-licenses">Goodwill licenses</h2>
<p>If you don’t want to waste time enforcing a license, you could sell a goodwill license. It’s in between donations and regular licenses, where you kindly ask the users of your project to pay. But inside companies, it’s easier to argue for paying for a license than for a donation.</p>
<h2 id="support">Support</h2>
<p>Some developers or companies need support to use your software. You can offer them support contracts, e. g. to promise a short response time for bug reports or availability for calls. Some companies require this level of support, some will use it extensively, and some won’t ever use it.</p>
<p>Offering support can work well for teams but can be a distraction from the work they are good at for single developers.</p>
<h2 id="contracting">Contracting</h2>
<p>If you open sourced something like a complex library, companies might want to hire you to implement your solution in their system. They know that you are the expert for the software you’ve written and happily pay you, even if it’s more than an average freelancer rate.</p>
<p>If you enjoy open source because you didn’t want to work with clients, that’s probably not for you. On the other hand, you’ll always use your code, which will help better understand the needs to implement your software.</p>
<h2 id="dual-licensing">Dual licensing</h2>
<p>Your software can have multiple licenses. For example, a basic version can be free for everyone, while another version, probably more tailored to what companies need, can be licensed differently.</p>
<p>Your publicly accessible software still allows collaboration. You would probably want to keep the advanced version closed to enforce the license. Keep in mind that maintaining different versions of software in parallel is more complicated.</p>
<h2 id="freemium">Freemium</h2>
<p>Also, consider offering a free version for everyone and add a few benefits for professional use that are only available for paying users.</p>
<p>Those extra benefits can be access to more features/plugins or other things like a community with restricted access.</p>
<h2 id="managed-hosting">Managed hosting</h2>
<p>If your software needs hosting and can be self-hosted, consider offering a managed hosting solution. Many people don’t want to operate their instance and happily pay you to do that for them.</p>
<p>You need to develop something to sell it, provision new instances, and maintain them. It’s a very fair approach and can work well, as you’ll always have people paying for convenience.</p>

<p>There are so many platforms tailored to easily offer sponsorship subscriptions to your users that you should think about adding this. But be aware that it’s the same as with donations. You won’t get many sponsors, but it’s recurring revenue that can help you feel safe.</p>
<h2 id="day-job">Day job</h2>
<p>Some companies make open source part of your day job. If you don’t need to work on an own project, but love a regular job’s safety, consider looking for such an employer.</p>
<p>By the way, we’re looking for a <a href="https://ueberdosis.io/frontend-engineer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">frontend engineer</a> and a <a href="https://ueberdosis.io/php-developer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">PHP developer</a>, both roles include working on existing and new open source projects.</p>

<p>People always request features. Try turning feature requests into sponsored work, and offer to add those features in exchange for money. If multiple users or companies ask for the same functionality, you can even offer to share the development costs. Don’t forget to mention your sponsors in the release notes!</p>
<h2 id="bounties">Bounties</h2>
<p>Bounties enable users to attach money to a bug report. In most cases, that’s only a few dollars, but it doesn’t have to be you working on it. It can also motivate contributors to help you with the maintenance, which is cool too.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/sponsorware/docs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sponsorware</a> is a way to offer sponsors early-access to private repositories. When you reach a certain number of sponsors, you can open source the project and make it available to everyone.</p>
<p>It will help if you start new projects regularly and have an audience that can’t wait to test them.</p>
<h2 id="audience">Audience</h2>
<p>You can use your open source work as marketing for yourself and build up an audience. It takes time and doesn’t make you money from that alone, but it’s a chance to sell something additional. You probably know what your followers want, so it can be great to build something for them and make money with that.</p>
<p>It’s a lot of extra work on top of your open source projects. You should consider this if you are very active on social media anyway.</p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>You are the expert for your software, so I’d want to learn more about your software. I prefer to get that educational content from you. Consider publishing an ebook or a video course that explains your software in all details and helps people use it.</p>
<h2 id="crowdfunding">Crowdfunding</h2>
<p>With an existing audience interested in your software, there is a good chance people are willing to pay you upfront to work on your project. It’s an excellent approach for something tangible, like a significant rewrite, a big shift in the development, or any other effort the community is willing to support.</p>
<h2 id="ads">Ads</h2>
<p>If you’ve got widespread documentation with thousands of page views every month, you’ll be able to put ads on it and earn money with that.</p>
<p>It’s not what we like to do because it’s little money to sell people’s privacy using your software. That said, some companies try to take an ethical approach to ads.</p>
<h2 id="shop">Shop</h2>
<p>If your software has a brand and people identify with it, a shop might work well for you. You can sell stickers, shirts, caps, posters, and whatnot.</p>
<p>Those products still cost you money, so you’ll only earn a part of what the customer pays for the product.</p>
<h2 id="products">Products</h2>
<p>Maybe you have a software that can be the foundation for a whole ecosystem. Then you have the chance to add commercial products to the universe of your software.</p>
<p>People will buy your products because you’ll tailor them precisely for the software you built in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="paid-certifications">Paid certifications</h2>
<p>If companies are looking for developers with knowledge of your software, you can certify developers’ abilities. But if you already reached that level of popularity, you probably don’t need that post here anyway.</p>
<p>That said, we’ll hope that your open source project gains popularity and the list of things you can do somehow helps you make the maintenance and development sustainable.</p>
<p>Let’s face it—nobody profits from abandoned open source projects.</p>
<p>That should give you a rough idea of what directions you could take.

October 20, 2020 | https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/assorted-thoughts-on-zig-and-rust/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/assorted-thoughts-on-zig-and-rust/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>I've been using <a href="https://ziglang.org/">zig</a> for ~4 months worth of side projects, including a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/focus/tree">toy text editor</a> and an <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/imp">interpreter for a relational language</a>. I've written ~10kloc.</p>
<p>That's not nearly enough time to form a coherent informed opinion. So instead here is an incoherent assortment of thoughts and experiences, in no particular order :)</p>
<p>This is not meant to be an introduction to zig - check out the excellent <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/">language docs</a> or the new <a href="https://ziglearn.org/">ziglearn.org</a> instead. I'll try to focus instead on things that are not immediately obvious from reading intro material.</p>
<p>The obvious point of comparison is to rust. For context, I've been using rust <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/three-months-of-rust/">since 2015</a>. Mostly in research positions writing throwaway code, but also ~14 months working on <a href="https://materialize.io/">a commercial database</a> which is ~100kloc.</p>
<hr>
<p>Zig is dramatically simpler than rust. It took a few days before I felt proficient vs a month or more for rust.</p>
<p>Most of this difference is <strong>not</strong> related to lifetimes. Rust has patterns, traits, dyn, modules, declarative macros, procedural macros, derive, associated types, annotations, cfg, cargo features, turbofish, autoderefencing, deref coercion etc. I encountered most of these in the first week. Just understanding how they all work is a significant time investment, let alone learning when to use each and how they affect the available design space.</p>
<p>I still haven't internalized the full rule-set of rust enough to be able predict whether a design in my head will successfully compile. I don't remember the order in which methods are resolved during autoderefencing, or how module visibility works, or how the type system determines if one impl might <a href="https://github.com/Ixrec/rust-orphan-rules#what-are-the-orphan-rules">overlap another or be an orphan</a>. There are frequent moments where I know what I want the machine to do but struggle to encode it into traits and lifetimes.</p>
<p>Zig manages to provide many of the same features with a single mechanism - compile-time execution of regular zig code. This comes will all kinds of pros and cons, but one large and important pro is that I already know how to write regular code so it's easy for me to just write down the thing that I want to happen.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the key differences between zig and rust is that when writing a generic function, rust will prove that the function is type-safe for every possible value of the generic parameters. Zig will prove that the function is type-safe only for each parameter that you actually call the function with.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this allows zig to make use of arbitrary compile-time logic where rust has to restrict itself to structured systems (traits etc) about which it can form general proofs. This in turn allows zig a great deal of expressive power and also massively simplifies the language.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can't type-check zig libraries which contain generics. We can only type-check specific uses of those libraries.</p>
<pre><span>// This function is typesafe if there exist no odd perfect numbers
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number#Odd_perfect_numbers
fn foo(comptime n: comptime_int, i: usize) usize {
  const j = if (comptime is_odd_perfect_number(n)) "surprise!" else 1;
  return i + j;
}
</span></pre>
<p>This means zig also doesn't get the automatic, machine-checked documentation of type constraints that rust benefits from and may face more challenges providing IDE support.</p>
<p>This might harm the zig ecosystem by making it harder to compose various libraries. But <a href="https://julialang.org/">julia</a> has a similar model and in practice it has worked very well (<a href="https://youtu.be/dmWQtI3DFFo?t=1710">eg</a>, <a href="https://www.oxinabox.net/2020/02/09/whycompositionaljulia.html">eg</a>).</p>
<hr>
<p>Zig's comptime allows expressing <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/open-multiple-dispatch-in-zig/">open multiple dispatch</a> as a library.</p>
<p>It should be relatively trivial to implement specialization the same way, which has been a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31844">work in progress</a> in rust for years and is critical to many optimizations in julia's math libraries.</p>
<p>Julia chose dynamic typing because it's very difficult to encode the types of various mathematical operations into a general schema (eg fortress <a href="https://youtu.be/EZD3Scuv02g?t=3011">struggled with this</a>). Zig's approach of not requiring general schemas but still type-checking individual cases may be an interesting sweet spot.</p>
<hr>
<p>I used the <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1350.html">2020 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses</a> to get a sense of the relative frequency of different causes of memory unsafety.</p>
<p>(I'm assuming that the zig programmer is using release-safe mode instead of the unfortunately named release-fast mode which disables all runtime safety checks.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Out-of-bounds Write (787/1350)</li>
<li>Out-of-bounds Read (125/1350)</li>
<li>Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (119/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both languages primarily use bounds-checked slices and relegate pointer arithmetic to a separate type (<code>*T</code> in rust, <code>[*]T</code> in zig).</p>
<ul>
<li>NULL Pointer Dereference (476/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both languages require explicit annotations for nulls (<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> in rust, <code>?T</code> in zig) and require code to either handle the null case or safely crash on null (<code>x.unwrap()</code> in rust, <code>x.?</code> in zig).</p>
<p>Dereferencing/casting a null c pointer is undefined behavior in both languages, but is checked at runtime in zig.</p>
<ul>
<li>Integer Overflow or Wraparound (190/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Rust catches overflow in debug and wraps in release. Zig catches overflow in debug/release-safe and leaves behavior undefined in release-fast.</p>
<p>Both languages allow explicitly asking for wraparound (<code>x.wrapping_add(1)</code> in rust, <code>x +% 1</code> in zig).</p>
<ul>
<li>Use After Free (416/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as all unsafe code obeys the aliasing and lifetime rules, rust protects completely against UAF.</p>
<p>Zig has little protection. The recently merged
<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/575fbd5e3592cff70cbfc5153884d919e6bed89f/lib/std/heap/general_purpose_allocator.zig">GeneralPurposeAllocator</a> avoids reusing memory regions (which prevents freed data from being overwritten) and reusing pages (which means that UAF will eventually result in a page fault). But this comes at the cost of fragmentation and lower performance and it also won't provide protection for child allocators using the GPA as a backing allocator.</p>
<hr>
<p>Both languages will insert implicit casts between primitive types and pointers whenever it is safe to do so, and require explicit casts otherwise. (With the odd exception that rust will not implicitly upcast numbers).</p>
<p>Both languages support generics which almost entirely avoids the need to cast void pointers.</p>
<hr>
<p>In rust the Send/Sync traits flag types which are safe to move/share across threads. In the absence of unsafe code it should be impossible to cause data races.</p>
<p>Zig has no comparable protection. It's possible to implement the same logic as Send/Sync in comptime zig, but without the ability to track ownership the rules would have to be much more restrictive.</p>
<hr>
<p>Rust prevents having multiple mutable references to the same memory region at the same time.</p>
<p>This means that eg iterator invalidation is prevented at compile time, because the borrow checker won't allow mutating a data-structure while an iterator is holding a reference to the data-structure. Similarly for resizing a data-structure while holding a reference to the old allocation. Both examples are easy sources of UAF in zig.</p>
<hr>
<p>Neither language is able to produce stack traces for stack overflows at the moment (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/51405">rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1616">zig</a>)</p>
<p>In the future zig is <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1006">intended</a> to statically check the maximum stack usage of your program and force recursive code to explicitly allocate space on the heap, so that stack overflows produce a recoverable OutOfMemory error rather than a crash.</p>
<p>This is not an academic problem - I've seen real-world crashes from recursive tree transformations in compilers (<a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/pull/3996">eg</a>) and it's often painful to write the same logic without recursion.</p>
<hr>
<p>Undefined behavior in rust is defined <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/what-unsafe-does.html">here</a>. It's worth noting that breaking the aliasing rules in unsafe rust can cause undefined behavior but these rules are not yet well-defined. So far this hasn't caused me any problems but it is a little unnerving.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">Miri</a> is an interpreter for rusts Mid-level Intermediate Representation which will detect many (but not all) cases of undefined behavior in unsafe rust. It's far too slow to use for the whole materialize test suite but was useful for unit-testing an unsafe module.</p>
<p>Undefined behavior in zig is defined <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Undefined-Behavior">here</a>. This list is <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1966">probably incomplete</a> given that the core language is still under development.</p>
<p>Zig <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2301">aspires</a> to insert runtime checks for almost all undefined behavior when compiling in debug mode. So far all the easy cases are handled, which is already a dramatic improvement over c.</p>
<p>Zigs compile-time partial evaluation is done by an IR interpreter - it seems plausible that this could also be used as a miri-like tool in the future.</p>
<hr>
<p><code>@import</code> takes a path to a file and turns the whole file into a struct. So modules are just structs. And vice-versa - if you have a large struct declaration you can move it into a file to reduce the indentation.</p>
<p>Zig doesn't care at all where you put files on the filesystem.</p>
<p><code>@import</code> is part of the compile-time execution system so things like platform-specific modules and configurable features can be specified in regular code rather than rust's limited set of <code>#[cfg(...)]</code> macros.</p>
<hr>
<p>Array, struct, enum and union literals can be anonymous - <code>.{.Constant = 1.0}</code> is an anonymous union with it's own type, but can be implicitly cast to any union with a <code>Constant: f64</code> field because they share the same structure.</p>
<p>In rust my code is littered with <code>use Expr::*</code> and I'm careful to avoid name collisions between different enums that I might want to import in the same functions. In zig I just use anonymous literals everywhere and don't worry about it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Anonymous literals are also nice when using structs to simulate keyword arguments. No need to find and import the correct type:</p>
<pre><span>fn do_things(config: struct {
  max_things: usize = 1000, // default value
  flavor: Flavor,
}) void {
  ...
}

do_things(.{.flavor = .Strawberry});
</span></pre>
<hr>
<p>There is a pattern that shows up a lot in the materialize codebase:</p>
<pre><span>let</span><span> constant </span><span>= </span><span>if let </span><span>Expr</span><span>::</span><span>Constant(constant) </span><span>=</span><span> expr { constant } </span><span>else </span><span>{ </span><span>panic!</span><span>() }</span><span>;
</span></pre>
<p>It's common enough that many types have methods like <code>expr.unwrap_constant()</code>.</p>
<p>In zig:</p>
<pre><span>const constant = expr.Constant;
</span></pre>
<p>A similar pattern is:</p>
<pre><span>if</span><span> some_condition {
    </span><span>if let </span><span>Expr</span><span>::</span><span>Constant(</span><span>_</span><span>) </span><span>=</span><span> expr {
        </span><span>...
    </span><span>}
}
</span></pre>
<p>Again, many types get methods like <code>expr.is_constant()</code>.</p>
<pre><span>if</span><span> some_condition </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span> expr</span><span>.</span><span>is_constant</span><span>(…</span></pre></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>If programmers were just more disciplined, more <em>professional</em>, they’d write better software. All they need is a <a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Martin-Clean-Coder-The-A-Code-of-Conduct-for-Professional-Programmers/PGM8366.html">code of conduct</a> telling them how to work like those of us who’ve worked it out.</p>
<p>The above statement is true, which is a good thing for those of us interested in improving the state of software and in helping our fellow professionals to improve their craft. However, it’s also very difficult and inefficient to apply, in addition to being entirely unnecessary. In the common parlance of our industry, “discipline doesn’t scale”.</p>
<p>Consider the trajectory of object lifecycle management in the Objective-C programming language, particularly the NeXT dialect. Between 1989 and 1995, the dominant way to deal with the lifecycle of objects was to use the <tt>+new</tt> and <tt>-free</tt> methods, which work much like <tt>malloc/free</tt> in C or <tt>new/delete</tt> in C++. Of course it’s <em>possible</em> to design a complex object graph using this ownership model, it just needs discipline, that’s all. Learn the heuristics that the experts use, and the techniques to ensure correctness, and get it correct.</p>
<p>But you know what’s better? Not having to get that right. So around 1994 people introduced new tools to do it an easier way: reference counting. With NeXTSTEP Mach Kit’s <tt>NXReference</tt> protocol and OpenStep’s <tt>NSObject</tt>, developers no longer need to know when <em>everybody</em> in an app is done with an object to destroy it. They can indicate when a reference is taken and when it’s relinquished, and the object itself will see when it’s no longer used and free itself. Learn the heuristics and techniques around auto releasing and unretained references, and get it correct.</p>
<p>But you know what’s better? Not having to get that right. So a couple of other tools were introduced, so close together that they were probably developed in parallel[*]: Objective-C 2.0 garbage collection (2006) and Automatic Reference Counting (2008). ARC “won” in popular adoption so let’s focus there: developers no longer need to know exactly when to retain, release, or autorelease objects. Instead of describing the edges of the relationships, they describe the <em>meanings</em> of the relationships and the compiler will automatically take care of ownership tracking. Learn the heuristics and techniques around weak references and the “weak self” dance, and get it correct.</p>
<p>[*] I’m ignoring here the significantly earlier integration of the Boehm conservative GC with Objective-C, because so did everybody else. That in itself is an important part of the technology adoption story.</p>
<p>But you know what’s better? You get the idea. You see similar things happen in other contexts: for example C++’s move from <tt>new/delete</tt> to smart pointers follows a similar trajectory over a similar time. The reliance on an entire programming community getting some difficult rules right, when faced with the alternative of using different technology <em>on the same computer</em> that follows the rules for you, is a tough sell.</p>
<p>It seems so simple: computers exist to automate repetitive information-processing tasks. Requiring programmers who have access to computers to recall and follow repetitive information processes is wasteful, when the computer can do that. So give those tasks to the computers.</p>
<p>And yet, for some people the problem with software isn’t a lack of automation but a lack of discipline. Software would be better if only people knew the rules, honoured them, and slowed themselves down so that instead of cutting corners they just chose to ignore important business milestones instead. Back in my day, everybody knew “no Markdown around town” and “don’t code in an IDE after Labour Day”, but now the kids do whatever they want. The motivations seem different, and I’d like to sort them out.</p>
<p>Let’s start with hazing. A lot of the software industry suffers from “I had to go through this, you should too”. Look at software engineering interviews, for example. I’m not sure whether anybody actually believes “I had to deal with carefully ensuring NUL-termination to avoid buffer overrun errors so you should too”, but I do occasionally still hear people telling less-experienced developers that they should learn C to learn more about how their computer works. <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3212479">Your computer is not a fast PDP-11</a>, all you will learn is how the C virtual machine works.</p>
<p>Just as Real Men Don’t Eat Quiche, so <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/articles/927/real-programmers-don-t-use-pascal">real programmers don’t use Pascal</a>. Real Programmers use FORTRAN. This motivation for sorting discipline from rabble is based on the idea that if it isn’t at least as hard as it was when <em>I</em> did this, it isn’t hard enough. And that means that the goalposts are movable, based on the orator’s experience.</p>
<p>This is often related to the <em>term</em> of their experience: you don’t need TypeScript to write good React Native code, just Javascript and some discipline. You don’t need React Native to write good front-end code, just JQuery and some discipline. You don’t need JQuery…</p>
<p>But along with the term of experience goes the breadth. You see, the person who learned reference counting in 1995 and thinks that you can only <em>really</em> understand programming if you manually type out your own reference-changing events, presumably didn’t go on to use garbage collection in Java in 1996. The person who thinks you can only <em>really</em> write correct software if every case is accompanied by a unit test presumably didn’t learn Eiffel. The person who thinks that you can only <em>really</em> design systems if you use the Haskell type system may not have tried OCaml. And so on.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that for this variety of disciplinarian, the appropriate character and quantity of discipline is whatever they had to deal with at some specific point in their career. Probably a high point: after they’d got over the tricky bits and got productive, and after you kids came along and ruined everything.</p>
<p>Sometimes the reason for suggesting the disciplined approach is entomological in nature, as in the case of the eusocial insect the “performant” which, while not a real word, exists in greater quantities in older software than in newer software, apparently. The performant is capable of making software faster, or use less memory, or more concurrent, or less dependent on I/O: the specific characteristics of the performant depend heavily on context.</p>
<p>The performant is often not talked about in the same sentences as its usual companion species, the irrelevant. Yes, there may be opportunities to shave a few percent off the runtime of that algorithm by switching from the automatic tool to the manual, disciplined approach, but does that matter (yet, or at all)? There are software-construction domains where specific performance characteristics are desirable, indeed that’s true across a lot of software. But it’s typical to focus performance-enhancing techniques on the bits where they enhance performance that needs enhancing, not to adopt them across the whole system on the basis that it was better when everyone worked this way. You might save a few hundred cycles writing native software instead of using a VM for that UI method, but if it’s going to run after a network request completes over EDGE then trigger a 1/3s animation, nobody will notice the improvement.</p>
<p>Anyway, whatever the source, the problem with calls for discipline is that there’s no strong motivation to <em>become</em> more disciplined. I can use these tools, and my customer is this much satisfied, and my employer pays me this much. Or I can learn from you how I’m <em>supposed</em> to be doing it, which will slow me down, for…your satisfaction? So you know I’m doing it the way it’s supposed to be done? Or so that I can tell everyone else that they’re doing it wrong, too? Sounds like a great deal.</p>
<p>Therefore discipline doesn’t scale. Whenever you ask some people to slow down and think harder about what they’re doing, some fraction of them will. Some will wonder whether there’s some other way to get what you’re peddling, and may find it. Some more will not pay any attention. The dangerous ones are the ones who thought they <em>were</em> paying attention and yet still end up not doing the disciplined thing you asked for: they either torpedo your whole idea or turn it into not doing the thing (see OOP, Agile, Functional Programming). And still more people, by far the vast majority, just weren’t listening at all, and you’ll never reach them.</p>
<p>Let’s flip this around. Let’s look at where we <em>need</em> to be disciplined, and ask if there are gaps in the tool support for software engineers. Some people want us to always write a failing test and make it pass before adding any code (or want us to write a passing test and revert our changes if it accidentally fails): does that mean our tools should not let us write code for which there’s no test? Does the same apply for acceptance tests? Some want us to refactor mercilessly; does that mean our design tools should always propose more parsimonious alternatives for passing the same tests? Some say we should get into the discipline of writing code that always reveals its intent: should the tools make a crack at interpreting the intention of the code-as-prose?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_privacy">Privacy on the Internet</a> is important because privacy risks range from the gathering of statistics on users to more malicious acts such as the spreading of spyware and the exploitation of various forms of bugs (software faults). Many companies, such as Google, track which websites people visit and then use the information, for instance by sending advertising based on one's web browsing history. Sometimes prices on products are changed on the same website, depending on tracking information, and two people may view the exact same product on the exact same website yet be presented with very different prices.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This article isn't specifically about privacy issues only, it's about promises that are being broken, which might be about privacy. It is also about the lack of user freedom, as in the choice to enable or disable features, such as automatic updates, or forced usage of third party services, or software that the user generally is unaware of or don't have a say about.</p>

<p>Privacy as a subject regarding the usage of services on the Internet is a very difficult subject to deal with. Not only can it be difficult to actually define privacy, but it also requires a balance between freedom of choice by the users, security and usability. Naturally you need to be able to use the browser on the Internet and as such you will always leave some kind of trail behind, and this article is not about how you can hide your tracks. What I am addressing in this article are browsers that are either promoted as "privacy respecting" by the developers or in general are considered to be so, mostly due to misunderstanding or misinformation, while it is very clear they are not.</p>

<p>Some browsers either directly violate users by collecting telemetric data without consent, or you have to opt-out rather than opt-in, or they bounce around the Internet visiting places in the background without you knowing, using third party services that operates with a privacy policy you either cannot trust or that are directly violating your privacy, or they have integrated third party software that do some of these things.</p>

<p>I will try to keep this article updated with relevant information as much as possible. I know several other browsers exist, but if they are not mentioned on this list I have either not had a change to investigate them, they are closed source and completely irrelevant (such as Microsoft Edge or Opera), or they are not actively maintained, or they are irrelevant "one mans show" which cannot be trusted for some reason or another.</p>

<p>I will also <strong>not</strong> be looking at browsers that only work on Microsoft Windows or macOS, even if they are Open Source. Both Microsoft Windows and macOS are highly controversial and completely untrustworthy operating systems.</p>

<p>Also please note that just because the developers of a browser are promising that their browser is privacy respecting doesn't mean that you can trust the information. As you will see with the examples of some of the browsers below even developers some times compromise user privacy perhaps without even thinking about it.</p>

<p>I also want to make a strong advice to people recommending browsers to other people without investigation or knowledge. The <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/">privacy related channel on Reddit</a> is filled with wrong recommendations regarding privacy respecting browsers and many people are merely guessing or blindly trusting the information the browser producers are publishing. Neither Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome or Chromium, Brave, Waterfox, or several of the other recommended browsers truly respect privacy. They all do some form of telemetry and/or privacy compromising actions without the user consenting to it or even knowing about it.</p>

<p>Also, privacy doesn't mean that you simply pull out telemetry from Firefox, rebrand it, and then ship it. Privacy is more than that. Unless the browser is automatically checking for an updated version, and the website isn't logging that request, it cannot be considered truly private if the browser starts bouncing around on the Internet visiting all kinds of places without the user has done anything more than open the browser up! Every time the browser makes a DNS request, that DNS request is in most cases logged unless the user actively does something to mitigate that - such as using a trusted VPN or non-logging DNS service. Furthermore, the Mozilla add-on CDN is logging user activity, as is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_CloudFront">Amazon Cloudfront</a>, so if the browser visits these places without the user explicitly pushes a "check for updates" option, the browser is compromising user privacy. The point is that the user needs to have the choice to disable automatic updates of both browser and extensions and that nothing happens until the user actively has accepted that.</p>

<p>I intent to add more browsers to this list as time permits so keep coming back for more updated information. Also, if you discover any mistakes on my part, feel free to email me about it so that I can correct the information.</p>

<h2 id="third-party-clones">Third party clones</h2>
<p>Several third party clones of Firefox and Chromium exist that are branded and promoted as secure and privacy respecting alternatives that cannot fully be trusted for some reason or another. The code base for both Firefox and Chromium are huge and many skillful people work on the code every day. Having a "one mans show" or a small team of developers diverted clone running on your computer that are months behind security updates does not improve neither your privacy nor your security in any way.</p>
<p>Even when these small teams work fast they are still often many days behind security updates, which is a big problem. Just as an example, on January 23, 2018, Mozilla released Firefox 58 and Firefox ESR 52.6 with a bunch of security updates. Three days later, the Waterfox clone project was working on integrating these patches. On February 1, 2018, Waterfox 56.0.4 was released with these patches. Waterfox users had to wait nine days for security patches from a minor release!</p>

<h2 id="privacy-compromising">Privacy compromising browsers</h2>

<h3 id="firefox">Mozilla Firefox</h3>
<p>In the past I have always supported Mozilla and promoted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox">Firefox</a>, but Mozilla has made some pretty controversial decisions as of late and I no longer feel that Mozilla is an organization that deserves any support.</p>
<p>Firefox is promoted by Mozilla as a privacy respecting browser, but this is highly misleading. Firefox "phones home" every time you start it up even when you have disabled telemetry and automatic updates of extensions. Domains such as mozilla.org, cloudfront.net, firefox.settings.services.mozilla.com (see: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1598562#c12">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1598562#c12</a>), autopush.prod.mozaws.net, detectportal.firefox.com and location.services.mozilla.com are visited each time you start Firefox.</p>
<p>In 2017 Mozilla made a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliqz#Integration_with_Firefox">deal with Cliqz</a> where approximately 1% of users downloading Firefox in Germany would receive a version with Cliqz software included. And in 2018 Mozilla revealed that they had no data on the number of Firefox installations with disabled Telemetry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, we need better insight into our opt-out rates for telemetry. We use telemetry to ensure new features improve your user experience and to guide Mozilla's business decisions. However, an unknown portion of our users do not report telemetry for a variety of reasons. This means we may not have data that is representative of our entire population.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mozilla then developed the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1487578">Telemetry Coverage</a> system and distributed it to 1% of the Firefox installations. The system is automatically installed and designed to inform Mozilla whether telemetry is enabled in the browser.</p>
<p>Mozilla also <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/telemetry-collection-windows-default-browser-trend">developed a Windows-only scheduled task</a> which runs in the background once a day for each installation of Firefox installed on a computer running Microsoft Windows. The task collects information related to the system's current and previous default browser setting and the operating system locale and version.</p>
<p>This is a list of some of the things that Mozilla collects: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/#suggest-relevant-content">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/#suggest-relevant-content</a>.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/">Mozilla website</a> we can read (when I originally started writing this article) that <q>We put people over profit</q>, and <q>a product to support user privacy</q>. We can also read in the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla manifesto</a>, in the fourth principle, that <q>Individuals' security and privacy on the internet are fundamental and must not be treated as optional.</q> However, with their decision to make Cloudflare the default DNS provider for DNS over HTTPS, they are definitely not supporting user privacy or putting people over profit!</p>
<p>DNS over HTTPS is by itself <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxTdEEuyxHU">bad enough</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS#Criticism">highly criticized</a> with good reason, but combining it with a US based company like Cloudflare makes it even worse.</p>
<p>Cloudflare has made an <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/commitment-to-privacy/privacy-policy/firefox/">agreement</a> with Mozilla that when it acts as a DNS resolver for Firefox, that:</p>
<ul>
<li>DNS requests will be stored as part of Cloudflare's "temporary" logs which are permanently deleted within 24 hours.</li>
<li>Cloudflare will also collect and store the following information as part of its permanent logs:
<ul>
<li>Total number of requests processed by each Cloudflare co-location facility.</li>
<li>Aggregate list of all domain names requested.</li>
<li>Samples of domain names queried along with the times of such queries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Information stored in Cloudflare's permanent logs will be anonymized and may be held indefinitely by Cloudflare for its own internal research and development purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone who has worked with DNS servers knows what goes into such logs and in order for Cloudflare to keep their promise …</p></article></div>

    <p>The compact disc—the CD—was co-developed by Philips and Sony back in the 1980s.<sup id="fnref:updates-cd"><a href="#fn:updates-cd" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> This format was initially developed to store and play music but was then adapted to what we know as the CD-ROM to store data as well, and other formats followed that allowed us to read and write different kinds of data.</p>
<p>In 1995, Microsoft shipped Windows 95 as a CD-ROM and also as a pack of 13 or 26 floppy disks for compatibility with older computers that didn't have a compact disc reader. The entire Windows 95 operating system was only around 22 to 24 megabytes. (More than four times smaller than Instagram for iPhone!)</p>
<p>Priced at dozens or hundreds of dollars, software used to come packed in a huge box. The lucky software, the one that could afford the development costs, would update every couple of years. Windows 95, for instance, released a few updates and patches in 1996 and 1997, while Windows 98 was cooking.</p>
<p>The transaction happened at a physical store where we were buying something tangible: a program packed in a box.</p>
<p>The Office Suite—Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint—was bought in a box and installed in your machine with a CD. Every time you formatted your computer or bought a new one, you would come back to those CDs and re-install the software. Office 2003. 2009. 2013. These updates demarcated the appearance of file formats and new functionality that wouldn't work in older versions.</p>
<p>Today you buy a phone with a set of preinstalled apps and, right at your fingertips, you have an app store. With a payment method, you can make a transaction with a finger tap, your fingerprint, or a scan of your face. The app starts installing right away. Maybe free, maybe a couple of dollars. This world is cheaper but gets more and more expensive as we transition into a subscription model. And stores are not only on your phone but on your tablet, laptop, browser, and even on your photo camera or game console.</p>
<p>We get notified of new versions of the apps we use daily. And there's a culture of constant improvement in which applications like Dropbox, Spotify, or Uber release a new version weekly or bi-weekly to keep up-to-date.</p>
<p>At any stage, software bugs can be introduced, existing ones fixed, and new functionality added. We used to have a program that would continue to work the same way for years. But we now have what's called <em>liquid software</em>. Ever-changing code and hundreds of version numbers. (Dropbox is up to version 107.4.443 as I write these lines!)</p>
<p>We're in an era of constant updates, and there's no way back. If there's a bug today, we expect a fix tomorrow. A patch, an update. The problem comes when we can't say no and need to keep programs up-to-date to run on the latest operating systems that would otherwise stop functioning.</p>
<p>Software rots.</p>
<p>In the mobile world, there's a chance that you never upgrade and use a fixed set of functionality. But the web is different. When you load a website, it might have been re-deployed. A new version, updated seconds ago, runs in your browser. The red button you used yesterday to send an email might have changed its place, color, or shape overnight. A piece of functionality you liked (or the annoying bug you had yesterday) might suddenly go away.</p>
<p>An alternative might be to use custom systems or systems with slower update cycles in which backward compatibility is a priority.</p>
<p>Yet it's unlikely we'll ever go back to the once-a-year update, the diskette, or the CD.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wrapper"><div id="container"><div><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>While HTTP/3 specification is still in the draft stage, the latest version of the Chrome browser already <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/10/chrome-is-deploying-http3-and-ietf-quic.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">supports it by default</a>
. With Chrome holding around 70% of browser market share, you could say HTTP/3 has gone mainstream.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/the-long-road-to-http3/quic-logo.png" alt="QUIC logo"></p><p>The new revision of this foundational protocol aims to make the web more efficient, secure, and shorten the content-delivery latencies. In some ways, it’s a braver take of HTTP2: similar goals addressed by replacing the underlying TCP protocol with a new, purpose-built protocol QUIC. The best way to explain the benefits of QUIC is to illustrate where TCP falls short as a transport for HTTP requests. And to do that, we’ll start at the very beginning.</p><h3 id="http-the-original">HTTP. The Original.</h3><p>When Sir Tim Berners-Lee formalized the design of a simple <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">one-line hyper-text-exchange protocol</a>
in 1991, TCP was already an old, reliable protocol. The original definition document of what later became known as HTTP 0.9 specifically mentions TCP as a preferred, albeit not exclusive, transport protocol:</p><blockquote><p>Note: HTTP currently runs over TCP, but could run over any connection-oriented service.</p></blockquote><p>Of course, this proof-of-concept version of HTTP had very few similarities to HTTP we now know and love today. There were no headers and no status codes. The typical request was as simple as <code>GET /path</code>. The response contained only HTML and ended with the closing of the TCP connection.
Since browsers were not yet a thing, user was supposed to read HTML directly. It was possible to link to other resources, but none of the tags present in this early version of HTML requested additional resources asynchronously. A single HTTP request delivered a complete, self-sufficient page.</p><h3 id="emergence-of-http10">Emergence of HTTP/1.0</h3><p>In subsequent years the internet has exploded, and HTTP evolved to be an extendable and flexible general-purpose protocol, although transporting HTML remained its chief specialty. There are three critical updates to HTTP that enabled this evolution:</p><ul><li>introduction of methods allowed the client to identify the type of action it wants to perform. For example, POST was created to allow client sending data to the server to process and store</li><li>status codes provided a way for client to confirm that the server has processed the request successfully, and if not - to understand what kind of error has occured</li><li>headers added an ability to attach structured textual metadata to requests and responses that could modify the behavior of the client or server. Encoding and content-type headers, for example, allowed HTTP to transfer not just HTML, but any type of payload. “Compression” header allowed the client and server to negotiate supported compression formats, thus reducing the amount of data to transfer over the connection</li></ul><p>At the same time, HTML advanced to support images, styles, and other linked resources. Browsers were now forced to perfrom multiple requests to display a single web page, which the original connection-per-request architecture was not designed to handle. Establishing and ending a TCP connection involves a lot of back-and-forth packet exchange, so it is relatively expensive in terms of latency overhead. It didn’t matter much when a web-page consisted of a single text file, but as the number of requests per page increased, so did the latency.</p><p>The picture below illustrates how much overhead was involved in establishing a new TCP connection per request.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/the-long-road-to-http3/http1-tcp-overhead.png" alt="TCP connection requires three requests to establish connection and four to close it cleanly"></p><p>A “connection” header was created to address this problem. Client sends a request with “connection: keep-alive” header to signal intent to keep the TCP connection open for subsequent requests. If server understands this header and agrees to respect it, its response will also contain the “connection: keep-alive” header. This way, both parties maintain TCP channel open and use it for subsequent communication until either party decides to close it. This became even more important with the spread of SSL/TLS encryption, because negotianting an encryption algorithm and exchanging cryptographic keys requires an additional request/response cycle on each connection.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/the-long-road-to-http3/http1-keepalive.png" alt="A single TCP connection can be reused for multiple requests with “connection: keep-alive” header"></p><p>At the time, many of the HTTP improvements appeared spontaneously. When a popular browser or a server app saw a need for a new HTTP feature, they would simply implement it themselves and hoped that other parties would follow the suit. Ironically, a decentralized web needed a centralized governing body to avoid fragmentation into incompatible pieces. Tim Berners-Lee, the original creator of the protocol, recognized the danger and founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1994, which together with the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) worked on formalizing stack of internet technologies. As the initial step to bring more structure to the existing environment, they documented the most common features used in HTTP at the time and named the resulting protocol HTTP/1.0. However, because this “specification” described varied, often inconsistent techniques as seen “in the wild”, it never received a status of a standard. Instead, the work on the new version of the HTTP protocol has begun.</p><h3 id="standardization-of-http11">Standardization of HTTP/1.1</h3><p>HTTP/1.1 fixed inconsistencies of HTTP/1.0 and adjusted the protocol to be more performant in the new web ecosystem. Two of the most critical changes introduced were the use of persistent TCP connections (keep-alive’s) by default and HTTP pipelining.</p><p>HTTP pipelining simply means that client does not need to wait for the server to respond to a request before sending subsequent HTTP requests. This feature resulted in even more efficient use of bandwidth and reduced latencies, but it could be improved even more. HTTP pipelining still requires from server to respond in the order of requests received, so if a single request in a pipeline is slow to fulfill, all subsequent responses to a client will be delayed accordingly. This problem is known as head-of-the-line blocking.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/the-long-road-to-http3/http11-blocking.png" alt="Since large-picture.jpg was requested first, it’s blocking the delivery of the style.css"></p><p>At this point in time, the web is gaining more and more interactive capabilities. Web 2.0 is just around the corner, some webpages include dozens or even hundreds of external resources. To work around the head-of-the-line blocking, and to decrease page loading speeds, clients establish multiple TCP connections per host. Of course, the connection overhead never went anywhere. In reality, it got worse, since more and more applications encrypt HTTP traffic with SSL/TLS. So most browsers set the limit of maximal possible simultaneous connections in an attempt to strike a delicate balance.</p><p>Many of the larger web-services have recognized that existing limitations are too restricting for their exceptionally heavy interactive web-applications, so they “gamed the system” by distributing their app through multiple domain names. It all worked, somehow, but the solution has been far from elegant.</p><p>Despite a few shortcomings, the simplicity of HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 has made them widely successful, and for over a decade no one has made a serious attempt to change them.</p><h3 id="spdy-and-http2">SPDY and HTTP/2</h3><p>In 2008 Google released the Chrome browser, which rapidly gained popularity for being quick and innovative. It has given Google a strong vote on matters of internet technologies. In the early 2010s, Google adds support for its web protocol SPDY to Chrome.</p><p>HTTP/2 standard was based on SPDY with some improvements. HTTP/2 solved the head-of-the-line blocking problem by multiplexing the HTTP requests over a single open TCP connection. This allowed server to answer requests in any order, client could then re-assemble the responses as it received them, making the whole exchange faster within a single connection.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/the-long-road-to-http3/http2-multiplexing.png" alt="style.css was returned before the large-picture.jpg, becuase of HTTP/2 multiplexing"></p><p>In fact, with HTTP/2 server can serve the resources to a client before it even asked for it! To give an example, if the server knows that client will most likely need a stylesheet to display an HTML page, it can “push” the CSS to the client without waiting for a corresponding request. While beneficial in theory, this feature rarely seen in practice, since it requires a server to understand the structure of the HTML it serves, which is rarely the case.</p><p>HTTP/2 also allows compressing request headers in addition to the request body, which further reduces the amount of data transferred over the wire.</p><p>HTTP/2 solved a lot of problems for the web, but not all of them. A similar type of head-of-the-line problem is still present on the level of TCP protocol, which remains a foundational building block of the web. When a TCP packet gets lost in transit, the receiver can’t acknowledge incoming packages until the lost package is re-sent by a server. Since TCP is by design oblivious to higher-level protocols like HTTP, a single lost packet will block the stream for all in-flight HTTP requests until the missing data is re-sent. This problem is especially prominent on an unreliable connection, which is not rare in the age of ubiquitous mobile devices.</p><h3 id="http3-revolution">HTTP/3 revolution</h3><p>Since issues with HTTP/2 can not be resolved purely on the application layer a new iteration of the protocol must update the transport layer. However, creating a new transport-layer protocol is not an easy task. Transport protocols need to be supported by hardware vendors and deployed by the majority of network operators, which are reluctant to update because of the costs and efforts involved. Take IPv6 as an example: it was introduced 24 years ago and is still far from being universally supported.</p><p>Fortunately, there is another option. UDP protocol is as widely supported as TCP but is simple enough to serve as a building block for custom protocols running on top of it. UDP packets are fire-and-forget: there are no handshakes, persistent connections, or error-correction. The primary idea behind HTTP3 is to abandon TCP in favor of a UDP-based QUIC protocol. QUIC adds the necessary features (those that were previously provided by TCP, and more) in a way that makes sense for the web environment.</p><p>Unlike HTTP2, which technically allowed an unencrypted communication, QUIC strictly requires encryption to establish a connection. Additionally, encryption is applied to all data …</p></div></article></div></div></div></div>

<h2><span>Adolphe Sax, a Dinantais of genius</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Along with Joachim Patenier (1485-1524), the creator of landscape painting; with Antoine Wiertz (1806-1865), the lyrical painter; with a plethora of sculptors, painters, musicians, brassworkers and others, Dinant can legitimately pride itself on having been the birthplace on 6 November 1814 of Antoine-Joseph, or Adolphe, Sax, a prolific and inspired inventor in the manufacture of musical instruments.</p>
<p>In 1860, the diarist, Oscar Comettant, wrote, "In the services that he has rendered to musical art, in the battles he has had to go through to bring his discoveries to the light of day and defend them from despoilment and in the rewards he has been the object of from all the industrial nations, [Sax's life] rises to the heights of a social event. Novelists will draw from this strange life mysterious and moving episodes (we would add: the legal world will find in the account of the "Sax trial" a vast domain for a case law study) and the moralists will find in it the features of self-denial, physical courage and perseverance, of which only a lifted soul and a great heart are capable.</p>
</blockquote>
<a name="Enfance"></a>
<h2><span>An Agitated Childhood</span></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Antoine-Joseph Sax was born in the street that has borne his name since 1896, in a modest house, which was destroyed in 1914, and which was built on the present site of an important commercial building.</p>
<p>In its façade, there is a stained-glass window and an inscription chiselled into the stonework: "Adolphe Sax, 1814-1894, was born here". This window was solemnly inaugurated on 27 June 1954, on the initiative of the Tourist Information Centre, under the mayorship of Mr Léon Sasserath. It is the work of Mr Jean Jadin, who designed the cartoon, and Miss Maggy Arzée. Both were taught by Miss Yvonne Gérard and Mr Perot, teachers of graphic art and decoration at the Fine Arts Academy in Namur, which was then directed by Mr Lambeau. It was created under the direction of Mr Van de Capelle.</p>
<p>Son of Charles-Joseph Sax (1791-1865) and Marie-Joseph Masson (1813-1861), Antoine-Joseph was the eldest of eleven children (six boys and five girls, only four of whom survived, the others dying between the ages of 20 and 25).</p>
<p>His childhood was tragic. Hardly able to stand, Antoine-Joseph fell from a height of three floors, seriously bumping his head against a stone: he was believed dead. At the age of three, he swallowed a bowl of vitriolized water, and then a pin. Later, he was seriously burned in a gunpowder explosion; he fell onto a cast iron frying pan and burned himself on one side. Three times he escaped poisoning and asphyxiation in his bedroom, where varnished items were lying about during the night. Another time, he was hit on the head by a cobblestone; he fell into a river and was saved by the skin of his teeth.</p>
<p>"<em>He's a child condemned to misfortune; he won't live," his mother said. In the district, they called him "little Sax, the ghost</em>".</p>
<p>These initial serious incidents were, alas, but the prelude to an eventful existence such as only a few have known. In 1858, Adolphe Sax was miraculously saved from a cancer of the lip by a black doctor who knew the properties of certain Indian plants. What would the future have been but for this intervention?</p>
</blockquote>
<a name="Charles-Joseph"></a>
<h2><span>Charles-Joseph Sax</span></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>A joiner-cabinetmaker, Charles-Joseph Sax quickly launched himself, with success, into the manufacture of musical instruments. In the "New Street" he ran a large workshop. In this trade, he acquired such a reputation that, in 1815 (his eldest son was only one year old), he also set up a workshop in Brussels (where Antoine-Joseph's brothers and sisters were to be born), where he was summoned by William I of Orange (we were then under Dutch occupation). The latter appointed him as maker to the Court and entrusted him with the task of supplying suitable instruments to Belgium regimental music corps.</p>
<p>A self-taught man, therefore, Charles-Joseph Sax made woodwind and brass instruments, even violins and pianos. He registered a dozen patents and brought his instruments to perfection. He successfully participated in numerous exhibitions, where he was awarded flattering distinctions.</p>
<p>At the time when he could have spend the day playing, laughing and having fun, Antoine-Joseph observed the work in his father's workshop, besides being given instruction by one of his uncles, a teacher in Dinant. He was intelligent and his inventive mind was already showing itself, thanks to his love for music (whilst very young, he took singing and flute lessons). Thereafter, he was given lessons by his father, who quickly appreciated his abilities and did all he could to develop them.</p>
<p>Far from disregarding his son's aspirations, Charles-Joseph Sax made him his apprentice and, from a young age, he was conscious of the importance of his work, as though he were anticipating his destiny.</p>
<p>In 1853, after the death of seven of his eleven children, and following financial worries at his Brussels business, Charles-Joseph joined his son in Paris. The master was to become the servant, and was from then on in charge of making saxophones until his death in 1865.</p>

<h2><span>A productive childhood</span></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Supported and assisted by his father, the youth worked. He created, he perfected instruments and he played them. He was 16 when he went to the Industrial Exposition in Brussels to present flutes and ivory clarinets. At the age of 20, he made an entirely new clarinet, with 24 keys, a work of imagination and a masterpiece of manual work. Then, a new bass clarinet, which incited enthusiasm in Habeneck, the leader of the orchestra at the Paris Opera House, who was passing through Brussels, and who called the other clarinets "barbarian instruments".</p>
<p>Even at that early stage, this creation provoked jealousy in the soloist at the "Great Royal Harmony" in Brussels, who refused to use it because, he said, it had come from "that weedy little pupil, Sax". "Play your clarinet, then" Sax answered, " and I shall play mine." The challenge accepted, Sax triumphed in front of four thousand people. He became a soloist. Works were written for him that, after his departure, were no longer played because they were so difficult!</p>
<p>The young genius pursued his work. He invented a sound reflector, a new double-bass clarinet, a piano-tuning process that remained the inventor's secret and who probably was unable to exploit it for want of money, a steam organ "capable of being heard throughout the province": now that just shows Sax's tendency to think big!</p>
<p>Sax's beginnings throw a very curious light on his character (we shall call him Adolphe from now on): energy, courage, dynamism, total self-confidence. He refused to go and set up a business in St Petersburg, rejected an offer to set up in London. That means that his reputation exceeded frontiers. Sax was conscious of all his possibilities and his talent; he conceived the work that he felt the call to achieve; he was full of hope and he believed he had every chance of success; he had great visions, he believed in what he saw. He suffocated in his little country.</p>
<p>In 1840, he presented nine inventions at the Belgian Exhibition. He was denied the first medal on the plea of his young age; there would be nothing left to offer him the year after. He was thwarted in his true-love, if not in his pride. He refused the vermeil medal he was awarded, replying with pride, "<em>If they think me too young to deserve the gold medal, I myself think me too old to accept this vermeil one</em>."</p>
</blockquote>
<a name="Paris"></a>
<h2><span>The Call to Paris</span></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Europe's centre of attraction, Paris haunted him, Paris called him.</p>
<p>The composer Halévy wrote to him of the hope that composers had in his inventions: "<em>Hurry and finish your new family of instruments (saxophones) and come and succour to the poor composers that are looking for something new and to the public that is demanding it, if not to the world itself.</em>"</p>
<p>Let us add to this call and the snub in Brussels the fact of his family trials, and the decision was made: Adolphe Sax left for Paris "rich in ideas and light in cash": he had thirty francs in his pocket!</p>
<p>The year 1842 formed the turning point in Sax's life, possessing as he did his new invention: the saxophone and its family.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.dinant.be/uploads/pages/286/sax_atel.jpg" alt="">Moreover, in 1841, had he not presented it anonymously in Brussels, behind a curtain, so as not to disclose it and avoid the risk of plagiarism?</p>
<p>Adolphe Sax was almost thirty, "the age at which man's creative character affirms itself, at which the human personality is drawn." At the age of 27, Napoleon won his first battle in Italy; Newton was 24 and Einstein 26 when they devised their theories. Mozart died aged 35 and Schubert at 31. Examples of precocious geniuses are manifold.</p>
<p>As one former inhabitant of Dinant once rightfully said (1) "<em>a distinction has to be drawn here between a man who draws from his own abstract thoughts the stuff that his genius will knead, him for whom symbols and signs are sufficient to bring forth a thought laden with restrained life and latent splendours; and the other man for whom a technique, slow and tenacious apprenticeship on a complicated apparatus is necessary for him to be able to physically achieve the formal idea. Count, for example, how many early-developing mathematicians there are compared with child physicists. The former exist, the latter are nowhere to be found. Sax is of the category of intellectuals that concentrated on matter and not pure form"</em>.</p>
<p>In 1842, there was Adolphe Sax living in a simple shed in Rue Saint-Georges, Paris. To set up business, he had to borrow money from a musician acquaintance.</p>

<h2><span>Thanks to Berlioz</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p><span><strong>About the saxophone, he said "<em>Its principal merit in my view is the varied beauty of its accent, sometimes serious, sometimes calm, sometimes impassioned, dreamy or melancholic, or vague, like the weakened echo of an echo, like the indistinct plaintiff moans of the breeze in the woods and, even better, like the mysterious vibrations of a bell, long after it has been struck; there does not exist another musical instrument …</em></strong></span></p></div></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></div></div>

<p>This starts the server on port 1234. then players can connect to it with any tool that does tcp sockets. For example netcat:</p>

<p>For an improved experience you can use <code>rlwrap nc</code> instead to don't have incoming messages mess up your input</p>
<h3 id="joining-the-game"><a href="#joining-the-game" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>Joining the game</h3>
<p>Players can only join while the game is in the pre-game lobby state. People are asked for a name and then end up in the lobby chat. One player is the admin, usually the first person to connect. That person can execute the /start command to start round. Other chat commands are described in /help</p>
<p>After starting the round one of the players is assigned the imposter role, all other players are assigned the crewmate role. After that the game moves to the playing state</p>
<h3 id="the-playing-stage"><a href="#the-playing-stage" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>The playing stage</h3>
<p>In the playing state the players get a <code>#</code> prompt. At this point people can't chat to eachother anymore and can only run commands (without / prefix)</p>
<p>Everyone starts in the cafeteria, everyone gets 7 tasks randomly assigned. You can check your tasks with the <code>check tasks</code> command. You complete your tasks by moving to the room the task is in and typing the full task name, this is case sensitive.</p>
<p>You can see the room you're in by running the <code>examine room</code> or <code>e</code> command. This will also show you where you can move to from the current room and which crewmates are in the room with you. You can move to other rooms by using the <code>go [roomname]</code> command.</p>
<p>The <code>map</code> command shows an ascii art diagram of the map as reference.</p>
<p>If you are the imposter your main mission is not to complete the tasks but to murder all the crew without anyone figuring out you're the imposter. You can use the <code>murder crewmate</code> command to kill a crewmate that's in the same room as you. If there are multiple one will be chosen at random and the other crewmates will be notified someone died in the room with them.</p>
<p>If somebody notices a dead body in the room they can use the <code>report</code> command to halt the playing and move everyone to the discussion stage. It is also possible to trigger the discussion stage by going to the cafeteria and using the <code>press emergency button</code> command.</p>
<h3 id="the-discussion-stage"><a href="#the-discussion-stage" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>The discussion stage</h3>
<p>If a body has been found or a meeting has been called everyone gets thrown in the discussion state. At this point everyone can see who is still alive. Then there's a chatroom which is limited to 50 messages in total, so use the chat wisely. While/after chatting it is possible to either vote to throw someone off the ship or to skip using <code>/vote [number]</code> or <code>/skip</code>. You can also use <code>/list</code> to see who has not voted yet.</p>
<p>After everyone has voted either the game moves directly back to the playing stage or someone gets thrown off. After the player has been ejected it will be visible if it was the imposter (and then the game has been won by the crew) or if someone innocent was ejected. Then the game moves back to the playing stage.</p>
<p>The crew can win by having everyone complete all the tasks or by voting out the imposter. The imposter can win by killing all the crew or by making the crew vote out all their crewmates.</p>

October 19, 2020 | https://azumbrunnen.me/blog/my-chatbot-is-dead-%C2%B7-why-yours-should-probably-be-too/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://azumbrunnen.me/blog/my-chatbot-is-dead-%C2%B7-why-yours-should-probably-be-too/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                
<audio controls="controls"><source src="https://azumbrunnen.me/audio/chatbot-is-dead" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>



<p>Personal websites are usually like old books in a shelf. They languish, accumulate dust, and their wrinkles and cracks become more apparent over time. About 3 years ago I embarked on a simple experiment that would end up prolonging the shelf-life of my website by an unusually large margin.</p>



<p>Back in 2017, it seemed like Conversational UI was poised to take over the world. We saw Quartz turning news into a conversation, WeChat being featured as the poster-child of a post application world, iMessage turning into an unnecessarily complex mess, and chatbots popping up like mushrooms in moist forests.</p>



<p>Of course, any trend gaining so much traction and interest needs to be taken seriously. As such, I decided to familiarize myself with the topic, and turned my website into a chatbot.</p>



<p>Instead of being greeted by the internationally standardized greeting every designer used at some point in their career, there was no bold, dramatically oversized, and deep black sans-serif reading: <em>Hi, I’m a designer.</em> (To be fair, I didn’t use Proxima Nova either)</p>



<p>Instead, a couple of chat bubbles exuberantly ushered onto the canvas to greet users as if we had all been long time friends.</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" src="https://azumbrunnen.me/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-animated.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Conversational intro</figcaption></figure>



<p>It was witty, new, and slightly awkward. People would send messages that ranged from simple chit chat, to deep philosophical topics, to downright disturbing and ridiculous insults.</p>



<p>The experiment got featured on Hackernews, Medium, was used in psychological studies conducted by Dan Ariely’s team, and the source code was ripped and edited by various startups to fit their needs. One business in the Bay Area had an idea to use it to sell flowers in a conversational way. It looks like they went out of business.</p>



<p>The reaction and feedback was surprising to say the least. It was an idea so simple, so silly, that the outcome was in many ways unexpected. After all, the only one who really cares about your website, is usually yourself.</p>



<p>That didn’t stop me from revamping my website and kill the very thing that had turned it into a micro-celebrity before. With the death of my old chatbot, some angry emails by schools who are using it as a reference for “creative” web design, and a good amount of time that has passed ever since, I wanted to take a step back and set the record straight.</p>



<hr>



<h2>When chatbots matter</h2>



<p>So let’s be honest with ourselves for a moment: <em>when did you actually ever enjoy talking to a chat bot?</em> And I’m not talking about the type of bots you talk to when you’re bored, but about those that provide a deeper purpose.</p>



<p>It turns out that the answer is, at least for most of us, almost never.</p>



<p>I love you Intercom, except when I don’t. 99% of time I don’t want to talk to a silly and obtrusive avatar popping up from some corner of the screen before I even had a chance to check out what’s going on. Somehow, I can’t help but think others feel the same.</p>



<p>In fact, we do know that others feel the same. Chat heads jumping at us unasked, are the quintessential equivalent of the infamous sales clerk who eagerly talks to us upon entering a store.</p>



<p>To further add to the challenges: as soon as users go off-script, chat bot’s don’t just become awkward and unpredictable—they turn into little sociopaths that might rub users the wrong way.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="346" src="https://azumbrunnen.me/wp-content/uploads/grandma.png" alt="" srcset="https://azumbrunnen.me/wp-content/uploads/grandma.png 400w, https://azumbrunnen.me/wp-content/uploads/grandma-300x260.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"><figcaption>UX Chat.me —&nbsp;Conversational UX News</figcaption></figure>



<p>The moment you create a chat bot is the moment you allow customers to have a conversation with <em>your brand</em>. Not with yourself, not with your friend, but with an uber entity—a symbol—that represents everything you and your team stand for. That’s not a step to be taken lightly.</p>



<p>This simple conversational entity can be a fun tool to engage with people but depending on how the conversation goes, it can quickly turn into a misrepresentation of the values of your team and your company. So building a chat bot should never be the default choice, but an intentional one.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s worth asking yourself the following three questions before venturing into this space:</p>



<h3>1. Is your use case simple enough to be solved through chat?</h3>



<p>Conversation is incredibly complex and it’s challenging enough to keep it on track in the real world. If the use case isn’t simple, chances are, chat bots are not the right tool for the job.</p>



<h3>2. Is your NLP capable and sophisticated enough?</h3>



<p>There are two types of bots: pre-scripted bots with a range of default answers users can choose from, and Natural Language Processing based ones.</p>



<p>Choosing the right one is hard. While pre-scripted can feel too limiting, NLP can break at every corner. Often times, teams quickly fall into the trap of spending a huge amount of time focusing on personality and silly jokes, instead of solving the problem users hired you for in the first place.</p>



<p>Therefore, building on top of the first point above, within the conversational landscape, simple always wins.</p>



<h3>3. Are your users actually in chat based environments?</h3>



<p>Chat bots work best where users already are. If your users are primarily spending time in messaging platforms where bots and micro-apps can be seamlessly embedded, great. That can serve as an effective and natural way to engage with your audience because it matches the “be where users already are” principle.</p>



<p>If on the other hand, people come to your website, a medium that has made great strides to provide content in a non-linear and quick way, it often unnecessarily slows users down. </p>



<hr>



<h2>Farewell chatbot</h2>



<p>I don’t want to discredit chat bots as a paradigm. They have their use in certain industries, medium, and work well for a specific set of use cases. The important part is being deliberate, rather than jumping ship blindfolded.</p>



<p>So whereas turning my website into a chat was a fun experiment, I ultimately feel like it has slowly turned into a fad. I got fooled by the trend, and as a by-product became part of the trend itself.  Fads come and go, and as they get refined and re-interpreted, they ultimately find their true purpose. What we’re left with is the age old insight that it’s only through experimentation, that we can unlock concepts and ideas that last.</p>



<p>Rest in peace chat bot, long live chat bots.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>A survey conducted by u/PM_ME__UR_CANCER</p>
        <p><img src="https://747anon.github.io/blm-survey/img/github.png" width="200px" alt="Github"></p>
        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div><p>
                Hello!

                These are the results of a survey I posted recently, which aimed to ask the Github userbase what their
                thoughts on the controversial change of the default branch on Github (and by extension, Git) from 'master'
                to an alternative phrase like 'main' or 'trunk'.

                The name change was proposed as a response to the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, demanding equal rights
                and restructure of the American police system in response to the violent, tragic and reckless murders of
                innocent black men, women and children at the hands of police.
                
                </p><p>
                This proposed change has divided opinions within Github's user base. Github has claimed that the use of the word
                'master' has connotations to slavery in many countries, and it is being changed to make black developers feel
                more comfortable on the platform. However, many others have argued that the change is meaningless to the cause,
                distracts the public from the actual issues faced by real black people, and that the change breaks CI solutions
                and other habits. However, many others also support the change, believing that it is expanding inclusivity, and
                it is also a chance to change the name of the branch to something more meaningful or a name which expresses the
                branch's purpose more clearly.

                </p><p>
                In the wake of this, I decided to create this survey to ask the users of Github directly what they thought about
                the change. I also decided to collect information about the responder's ethnicity, country of residence and gender,
                in order to gauge the demographics which were mainly for and against the change.
            </p></div>
            <br>
        </section>
        <section id="demographics">
            <h2>Demographics</h2>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span>210</span> total responses

                <li>

                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                The survey spanned many different countries, reaching people who identified with around 16 different
                ethnic groups. The survey was also taken by several people who did not identify as either male or female.
                However, the majority of people who responded were white, and the most prevalent gender identity to respond
                was male, followed up by females. This was expected based on how the majority of people involved in computer
                science (and therefore, users of Github) are white males. Despite this however, many users chose not to
                disclose their gender identity, so the true distribution is not known.

                Perhaps unsurprisingly, the United States came in with the most responses by 29.5%, followed closely by many
                European countries. I did not list all countries in Europe, but many responses from other countries in Europe
                responded, taking up about 29% of all responses. Based on the ethnic data, I'm guessing most of these are from
                countries like Russia, the Netherlands, Spain, and so on. In hindsight, I probably should have included more
                countries in the list.

                The general opinion for most users is that they are <b>against</b> this change. 70% of all participants said
                that they are against the change, with only 15.7% being in support of the change. The other 14.3% fall under
                'Maybe' and 'Don't care', though their actual opinions are usually mixed and lean towards one of the two main
                options. Based on the written responses from users who were asked to explain their responses, most reasoning
                for their responses is as follows:
                </p><p>
                <b>For</b></p></div><ul>
                    <li>It is outdated terminology, and changing it from 'master' to some other alternative in order to create
                        a more inclusive space is worth the effort.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is an opportunity to pick a more meaningful name which better expresses what the branch actually does.
                        It is difficult to understand exactly what 'master' means on first encounter, whereas something like 'main'
                        would make much more sense.
                    </li>
                    <li>The name 'master' simply doesn't make sense to some users. It is now legacy terminology, and holding onto
                        it would simply be impractical.
                    </li>
                    <li>Some are not bothered either way, but feel that if individuals are offended by it they are supportive of
                        changing it to something else.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <b>Against</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>This action is being taken as a form of 'virtue signalling', Github and Microsoft merely did this in order
                        to jump onto a bandwagon while the Black Lives Matter movement was gaining momentum on social media.
                    </li>
                    <li>Several African Americans who responded stated that it was <i>more</i> offensive to change it, since it
                        comes across as white people "thinking we are "vulnerable" and need protecting" from a word which they
                        understand has multiple meanings in different contexts.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is an impractical change which will break workflows, continuous integration (CI) setups and several other
                        automated scripts which will require manual fixing later.
                    </li>
                    <li>Using the word 'master' depends on the context being used. In Git, it is widely understood that the word
                        'master' is used to mean master copy (the original copy which all derivatives are made from), and nobody
                        associates the word in this context with it's master/slave connotation.
                    </li>
                    <li>Several git tutorials and walkthroughs will become obselete.</li>
                    <li>It is introducing politics into a website which is not and has not ever been involved in politics, and it
                        is creating a social issue where there actually isn't one to begin with.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                It is clear that most users believe it is an unnecessary change, which breaks automated workflows, is insensitive
                given the current political landscape in the world, offensive to the group of people they are trying to be inclusive
                of, and suggests that Github and/or Microsoft are simply only interested in doing this to gain favor in public opinion.
            
                <p>
                However, some users also believe that it is time to rid the industry of questionable terminology, which could possibly
                offend certain people, is confusing and unclear in its meaning given the context it is used in, and should be
                swapped out with clearer and less ambiguous terminology.

                </p><p>
                Those who were in support of the change were asked to pick from a list of alternative names for the branch which they
                preferred, or suggest their own. The most popular one chosen by participants was 'main' with 47.6% of votes, followed
                by 'trunk' with 14.3%. Several other names were suggested which are listed below.

            <h2>Correlations</h2>
            <p>
                I originally ran this survey with the goal of discovering some kind of correlation between the different demographic
                groups which make up Github's user base, and how positive/negative their support is in relation to this issue. I also
                wanted to see which group was most supportive of the change, which group was least supportive, and how much the 
                response changed between ethnicities, genders and countries.

                Something I was not expecting when gathering the data for this survey is that every single African American who
                answered the survey responded 'No' in support of the change. Not only that, when asked to explain their reasoning,
                all of them sounded fairly spiteful towards Github and it's executives, since they felt that these decisions were
                made by white executives who didn't actually consider whether it offended them or not, and these responses suggest
                that they were more offended by Github feeling the need to change it in the first place.
                
                </p><p>
                You can also see that most of the users in support of this change are of either caucasian or asian descent, while
                more marginalised groups like africans, indians, hispanics and otherwise are almost universally against the changes,
                reflecting that the main ethnic group which feels the need to change it (and take offense to it) are white.

                The above holds true when compared to the correlation between countries, and it becomes clear that countries with a

<p><strong>In the first of the “Hitchhiker’s Guide to DRM” series, we define</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>what DRM (Digital Rights Management) is,</strong></li><li><strong>and why it plays an important role in ensuring fair use of digital resources through a combination of encryption, access control technology, and business rules.</strong></li></ul>








<h2><span id="The_Tale_of_Two_Boys"></span>The Tale of Two Boys<span></span></h2>



<p>Ram and Shyam were 7th graders who loved passing notes to each other during class. An inseparable duo, their notes contained the latest school gossip, computer game cheat codes, and cricket match scores.</p>



<p>Their notes used to pass through several of their classmates’ hands in their journey because they sat far away from each other in class. But, the boys weren’t worried about others learning their secrets because they trusted their classmates.</p>



<p>However, one sad day, one of their classmates opened one of their notes and broke their trust!! Delighted by the juicy gossip in the note, he used it to take Ram and Shyam’s lunch money.</p>

<p>Having lost all of his lunch money, Ram thought long and hard about sending his notes securely to Shyam and before long, Ram had an idea.</p>



<p>“How about using a code language to write my notes?”</p>



<p>Excellent idea, he thought to himself and set about creating a substitution code (1 for A, 2 for B, and so on). The following day in class, Ram used his new code language to write a secret message and send it to Shyam.</p>



<p>The note made its way to Shyam through the hands of several curious (&amp; nosy) classmates, and none of them could crack the code.</p>



<p>But, when Shyam got the message, he looked perplexed and thought to himself –</p>



<blockquote><p>What are these numbers, squiggly lines, and alphabets? Is Ram testing his new pen, or was he hit on the head with a cricket ball?</p></blockquote>



<p>Ram stared at Shyam’s puzzled face with equal bewilderment and suddenly realized his mistake. He had forgotten to send Shyam the key to the code!</p>



<p>So, Ram wrote down the code on a piece of paper and sent it to Shyam, who used it to decode the note.</p>



<p>Job well done, Ram thought to himself.</p>



<p>They didn’t know that one of their classmates had copied down the coded message and now had the codebook. For the second day in a row, Ram and Shyam lost their secrets and their lunch money.</p>



<p>They realized that they needed to transmit the code securely each time they used code or changed it.</p>



<p><strong>But how would they do that?</strong></p>



<h2 id="what-did-ram--shyam-do"><span id="What_Did_Ram_Shyam_Do"></span>What Did Ram &amp; Shyam Do?<span></span></h2>



<p><strong><em>Narrator:</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>The problem faced by the boys is a classic problem in data transmission. It is easy to use a codebook, create a secret message, and send it to the recipient but, how do you send the codebook to the recipient and prevent it from falling into the wrong hands?</em></p>



<p>Then one night, Shyam had a brainwave. He called Ram and said –</p>



<p><strong>Shyam:</strong>&nbsp;Hey – suppose we ask Hari to join us in note passing? We’ll ask him to keep the codebook safe in his schoolbag. Each time you or I need to write or read a message, we’ll ask Hari for the codebook. What do you think?</p>



<p><strong>Ram:</strong>&nbsp;Hey – that could work! But, will Hari agree to this?</p>



<p><strong>Shyam:</strong>&nbsp;Yea – I thought of that too. Every time we ask him for the codebook, let’s give him a chocolate.</p>



<p><strong>Ram:</strong>&nbsp;Ah – excellent idea!</p>

<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>&nbsp;So, the boys decided to bring in their friend Hari into their plans and asked him to be a “trusted” third-party. And, his duties were to –</p>



<ol><li>invent a new code every day to reduce chances of someone cracking it and</li><li>provide the code’s key to only Ram and Shyam in a way that nobody else can open and read it.</li></ol>



<p><strong>And the boys had to give him a bar of chocolate each time they asked for the codebook.</strong></p>



<p>Yummy price to pay for privacy, huh?</p>



<h2 id="digital-rights-management-drm"><span id="Digital_Rights_Management_(DRM)"></span>Digital Rights Management (DRM)<span></span></h2>



<p>In reality, what our creative 7th graders invented was a Digital Rights Management (DRM) system that not only provided security for their content (notes) but also allowed them to set some rules.</p>



<p>Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a method of protecting your content while having the flexibility to chose who gets to consume it via business rules and a secure, protected communication protocol.</p>



<p>For example, you could set rules to,</p>



<ul><li>block people from certain countries,</li><li>allow access to the content for a certain period,</li><li>prevent a user from casting the movie onto a screen,</li><li>block free users from accessing premium content,</li><li>block playback on specific devices,</li><li>etc.</li></ul>



<p>DRM plays a vital role in reducing piracy and ensuring that content creators can monetize their efforts.</p>



<p>But, remember this –&nbsp;<strong>DRM is not the same as encryption</strong>.</p>



<p>DRM is a system or solution that</p>



<ul><li>uses encryption to protect the content</li><li>uses specialized techniques to <strong>securely store and deliver</strong> the encryption/decryption keys&nbsp;<em>(codebooks in our 7th graders’ example)</em> and use the keys to decrypt the content in a way that it doesn’t get into the wrong hands. </li><li>allows the content publishers to set business rules and control who can consume their content (expiry times, etc.).</li></ul>



<p>We’ll learn more about this in future articles.</p>



<h2 id="back-to-our-7th-graders"><span id="Back_to_Our_7th_Graders"></span>Back to Our 7th Graders<span></span></h2>



<p>Now let’s go back and look at the simple solution that our 7th graders invented, which provided</p>



<ul><li>a high-security level through daily renewal and code rotation.</li><li>authentication and rights management (read, write permissions)</li><li>a well-defined pricing model.</li></ul>



<p>The truly remarkable part about this scheme is that as Ram and Shyam get more popular in school, they can allow a few other classmates to only “read” their messages and not “write” any messages.</p>



<p>All they’d need to do is go to Hari, give him the names and photos of their “newly trusted” friends, and ask Hari to allow them only to read the messages.</p>



<p>And&nbsp;<strong>if</strong>&nbsp;the boys’ messages get super-popular, they can ask Hari to</p>



<ul><li>block or allow access to classmates based on where they sit in class:&nbsp;<em>front-benchers not allowed</em>&nbsp;<strong>(geo-blocking)</strong></li><li>Create a set of special notes and charge their classmates two chocolates to read them. All they need to do is tell Hari their subscribers’ names.&nbsp;<strong>(paid usage / subscribers / freemium model)</strong></li><li>deny access to messages that are more than 2 hours old (stale news!)&nbsp;<strong>(expiry date &amp; time of day restriction)</strong></li></ul>



<p>And so on. Amazing, right?</p>



<p>A simple technique to prevent others from reading their messages has now turned into a full-blown business with</p>



<ul><li>heavy-duty encryption and</li><li>business rules that decide access and usage rights.</li></ul>



<h2 id="commercial-drm-solutions"><span id="Commercial_DRM_Solutions"></span>Commercial DRM Solutions<span></span></h2>



<p>Commercially, there are many trusted DRM technologies such as Microsoft’s PlayReady, Google’s Widevine, and Apple’s FairPlay. And there are DRM vendors who provide additional infrastructure around these DRM solutions by adding more business rules, analytics, and tools for publishers.</p>



<p>In future articles, we’ll examine the differences between them and see where they are applicable.</p>



<p>Until then, take care, and see you soon!</p>



<p><strong>Note: DRM is seen as a contentious topic with people on both sides of the fence. This series of articles is a technology-explainer and stays clear of the other debates on DRM.</strong></p>

            <section>
                <p>Today at <a href="https://cg.ivd.kit.edu/egsr18/">EGSR 2018</a>, Walt Disney Animation Studios announced the release of two large, production quality/scale data sets for rendering research purposes.
The data sets are available on a new <a href="https://disneyanimation.com/data-sets/">data sets page on the official Disney Animation website</a>.
The first data set is the Cloud Data Set, which contains a large and highly detailed volumetric cloud data set that we used for our “<a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/2017/07/spectral-and-decomposition-tracking.html">Spectral and Decomposition Tracking for Rendering Heterogeneous Volumes</a>” SIGGRAPH 2017 paper, and the second data set is the Moana Island Scene, which is a full production scene from <a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/2016/11/moana.html">Moana</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/shotCam_hyperion.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/shotCam_hyperion.jpg" alt="Figure 1: The Moana Island Data Set, rendered using Disney's Hyperion Renderer."></a></p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/wdas_cloud_hyperion_render.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/wdas_cloud_hyperion_render.jpg" alt="Figure 2: The Cloud Data Set, rendered using Disney's Hyperion Renderer."></a></p>

<p>In this post, I’ll share some personal thoughts, observations, and notes.
The release of these data sets was announced by my teammate, Ralf Habel, at EGSR today, but this release has been in the works for a very long time now, and is the product of the collective effort of an enormous number of people across the studio.
A number of people deserve to be highlighted: Rasmus Tamstorf spearheaded the entire effort and was instrumental in getting the resources and legal approval needed for the Moana Island Scene.
Heather Pritchett is the TD that did the actual difficult work of extracting the Moana Island Scene out of Disney Animation’s production pipeline and converting it from proprietary data formats into usable, industry-standard data formats.
Sean Palmer and Jonathan Garcia also helped in resurrecting the data from Moana.
Hyperion developers Ralf Habel and Peter Kutz led the effort to get the Cloud Data Set approved and released; the cloud itself was made by artists Henrik Falt and Alex Nijmeh.
On the management side of things, technology manager Rajesh Sharma and Disney Animation CTO, <a href="https://twitter.com/ncannon?lang=en">Nick Cannon</a>, provided crucial support and encouragement.
Matt Pharr has been crucial in collaborating with us to get these data sets released.
Matt was highly accommodating in helping us get the Moana Island Scene into a PBRT scene; I’ll talk a bit more about this later.
Intel’s Embree team also gave significant feedback.
My role was actually quite small; along with other members of the Hyperion development team, I just provided some consultation throughout the whole process.</p>

<p>Please note the licenses that the data sets come with.
The Cloud Data Set is licensed under a <a href="https://disney-animation.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/production/data_set_asset/6/asset/License_Cloud.pdf">Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License</a>; the actual cloud is based on a photograph by Kevin Udy on his <a href="https://coclouds.com/436/cumulus/%202012-07-26/">Colorado Clouds Blog</a>, which is also licensed under the same Creative Commons license.
The Moana Island Scene is licensed under a more restrictive, custom Disney Enterprises <a href="https://disney-animation.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/production/data_set_asset/4/asset/License_Moana.pdf">research license</a>.
This is because the Moana Island Scene is a true production scene; it was actually used to produce actual frames in the final film.
As such, the data set is being released only for pure research and development purposes; it’s not meant for use in artistic projects.
Please stick to and follow the licenses these data sets are released under; if people end up misusing these data sets, then it makes releasing more data sets into the community in the future much harder for us.</p>

<p>This entire effort was sparked two years ago at SIGGRAPH 2016, when Matt Pharr made an appeal to the industry to provide representative production-scale data sets to the research community.
I don’t know how many times I’ve had conversations about how well new techniques or papers or technologies will scale to production cases, only to have further discussion stymied by the lack of any true production data sets that the research community can test against.
We decided as a studio to answer Matt’s appeal, and last year at SIGGRAPH 2017, Brent Burley and Rasmus Tamstorf announced our intention to release both the Cloud and Moana Island data sets.
It’s taken nearly a year from announcement to release because the process has been complex, and it was very important to the studio to make sure the release was done properly.</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges was getting all of the data out of the production pipeline and our various proprietary data formats into something that the research community can actually parse and make use of.
Matt Pharr was extremely helpful here; over the past year, Matt has added support for <a href="http://ptex.us/">Ptex</a> textures and implemented the <a href="http://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2015-shading-course/burley/s2015_pbs_disney_bsdf_notes.pdf">Disney Bsdf</a> in <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3">PBRT v3</a>.
Having Ptex and the Disney Bsdf available in PBRT v3 made PBRT v3 the natural target for an initial port to a renderer other than Hyperion, since internally all of Hyperion’s shading uses the Disney Bsdf, and all of our texturing is done through Ptex.
Our texturing also relies heavily on procedural <a href="https://www.disneyanimation.com/technology/seexpr.html">SeExpr</a> expressions; all of the expression-drive texturing had to be baked down into Ptex for the final release.</p>

<p>Both the Cloud and Moana Island data sets are, quite frankly, enormous.
The Cloud data set contains a single OpenVDB cloud that weighs in at 2.93 GB; the data set also provides versions of the VDB file scaled down to half, quarter, eighth, and sixteenth scale resolutions.
The Moana Island data set comes in three parts: a base package containing raw geometry and texture data, an animation package containing animated stuff, and a PBRT package containing a PBRT scene generated from the base package.
These three packages combined, uncompressed, weigh in at well over 200 GB of disk space; the uncompressed PBRT package along weighs in at around 38 GB.</p>

<p>For the Moana Island Scene, the provided PBRT scene requires a minimum of around 90 GB if RAM to render.
This many seem enormous for consumer machines, because it is.
However, this is also what we mean by “production scale”; for Disney Animation, 90 GB is actually a fairly mid-range memory footprint for a production render.
On a 24-core, dual-socket Intel Xeon Gold 6136 system, the PBRT scene took me a little over an hour and 15 minutes to render from the ‘shotCam’ camera.
Hyperion renders the scene faster, but I would caution against using this data set to do performance shootouts between different renders.
I’m certain that within a short period of time, enthusiastic members of the rendering community will end up porting this scene to Renderman and Arnold and Vray and Cycles and every other production renderer out there, which will be very cool!
But keep in mind, this data set was authored very specifically around Hyperion’s various capabilities and constraints, which naturally will be very different from how one might author a complex data set for other renderers.
Every renderer works a bit differently, so the most optimal way to author a data set for every renderer will be a bit different; this data set is no exception.
So if you want to compare renderers using this data set, make sure you understand the various ways how the way this data set is structured impacts the performance of whatever renderers you are comparing.</p>

<p>For example, Hyperion subdivides/tessellates/displaces everything to as close to sub-poly-per-pixel as it can get while still fitting within computational resources.
This means our scenes are usually very heavily subdivided and tessellated.
However, the PBRT version of the scene doesn’t come with any subdivision; as a result, silhouettes in the following comparison images don’t fully match in some areas.
Similarly, PBRT’s lights and lighting model differ from Hyperion’s, and Hyperion has various artistic controls that are unique to Hyperion, meaning the renders produced by PBRT versus Hyperion differ in many ways:</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/grassCam_hyperion.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/grassCam_hyperion.jpg" alt="Figure 7a: 'grassCam' camera angle, rendered using Disney's Hyperion Renderer."></a></p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/grassCam_pbrt.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/grassCam_pbrt.jpg" alt="Figure 7b: 'grassCam' camera angle, rendered using PBRT v3. The sand dune in the background looks particularly different from the Hyperion render due to subdivision and displacement."></a></p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/palmsCam_hyperion.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/palmsCam_hyperion.jpg" alt="Figure 8a: 'palmsCam' camera angle, rendered using Disney's Hyperion Renderer."></a></p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/palmsCam_pbrt.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/palmsCam_pbrt.jpg" alt="Figure 8b: 'palmsCam' camera angle, rendered using PBRT v3. The palm leaves look especially different due to differences in artistic lighting shaping and curve shading differences. Most notably, the look in Hyperion depends heavily on attributes that vary along the length of the curve, which is something PBRT doesn't support yet. Some more work is needed here to get the palm leaves to look more similar between the two renders."></a></p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/rootsCam_hyperion.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/rootsCam_hyperion.jpg" alt="Figure 9a: 'rootsCam' camera angle, rendered using Disney's Hyperion Renderer."></a></p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/rootsCam_pbrt.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/rootsCam_pbrt.jpg" alt="Figure 9b: 'rootsCam' camera angle, rendered using PBRT v3. Again, the significant difference in appearance in the rocks is probably just due to subdivision/tesselation/displacement."></a></p>

<p>Another example of a major difference between the Hyperion renders and the PBRT renders is in the water, which Hyperion renders using photon mapping to get the caustics.
The provided PBRT scenes use unidirectional pathtracing for everything including the water, hence the very different caustics.
Similarly, the palm trees in the ‘palmsCam’ camera angle look very different between PBRT and Hyperion because Hyperion’s lighting controls are very different from PBRT; Hyperion’s lights include various artistic controls for custom shaping and whatnot, which aren’t necessarily fully physical.
Also, the palm leaves are modeled using curves, and the shading depends on varying colors and attributes along the length and width of the curve, which PBRT doesn’t support yet (getting the palm leaves is actually the top priority for if more resources are freed up to improve the data set release).
These difference between renderers don’t necessarily mean that one renderer is better than the other; they simply mean that the renderers are different.
This will be true for any pair of renderers that one wants to compare.</p>

<p>The Cloud Data Set includes an example render from Hyperion, which implements our Spectral and Decomposition Tracking paper in its volumetric rendering system to efficiently render the cloud with thousands of bounces.
This render contains no post-processing; what you see in the provided image is exactly what Hyperion outputs.
The VDB file expresses the cloud as a field of heterogeneous densities.
Also provided is an example <a href="https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/">Mitsuba</a> scene, renderable using the <a href="https://github.com/zhoub/mitsuba-vdb">Mitsuba-VDB plugin that can be found on Github</a>.
Please consult the README file for some modifications in Mitsuba that are necessary to render the cloud.
Also, please note that the Mitsuba example will take an extremely long time to render, since Mitsuba isn’t really meant to render high-albedo heterogeneous volumes.
With proper acceleration structures and algorithms, rendering the cloud only takes us a few minutes using Hyperion, and should be similarly fast in any modern production renderer.</p>

<p>One might wonder just why production data sets in general are so large.
This is an interesting question; the short answer across the industry basically boils down to “artist time is more expensive and valuable than computer hardware”.
We could get these scenes to fit into much smaller …</p></section></article></div></div>

<img src="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thumbnails-ffmpeg-featured-image.png?resize=678%2C381&amp;ssl=1" alt="thumbnails ffmpeg" title="thumbnails-ffmpeg-featured-image" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thumbnails-ffmpeg-featured-image.png?resize=678%2C381&amp;ssl=1" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==">
</figure>


<p>There are several easy ways to take screenshots/thumbnails of movies using FFmpeg. But why do this in the first place?</p>



<ol><li>You might want to generate thumbnails for your videos and show those thumbnails to the user when he scrolls through the video. </li><li>Or, you might want to compare two videos by doing a side-by-side comparison – this is quite common in video compression research. </li></ol>



<p>FFmpeg offers very simple techniques to extract screenshots or thumbnails at any position of the video (or rather, a way to dump frames at any point you choose). </p>



<p>Let’s see how! </p>




<h2><span id="Single_Screenshot/Thumbnail_Using_frames_v"></span>Single Screenshot/Thumbnail Using <code>-frames:v</code><span></span></h2>



<p>First, let’s understand how to take a single screenshot or thumbnail using FFmpeg. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputvideo.mp4 -ss 00:00:03 -frames:v 1 foobar.jpeg</code></pre>



<p>Understanding this is very simple! Here goes – </p>



<ol><li><code>-ss</code> is the seek command and it can be used to seek to the right position. For accurate seeking, you need to use output seeking and not input seeking (i.e., putting <code>-ss</code> before the input sequence). The syntax for specifying the time is <code>HH:MM:SS.MILLISECONDS</code>. For example, you can tell FFmpeg to seek to&nbsp;<code>01:02:03</code>&nbsp;– i.e., the 3rd second of the 2nd minute of the 1 hour of the movie!</li><li><code>-frames:v 1</code> tells FFmpeg to take only 1 screenshot. Note that, <code>-vframes</code> is deprecated. </li><li>then, you mention the name of the output file (<code>screenshot_10.jpg</code>). </li></ol>



<p>Simple, wasn’t it? Now that you know how to produce a single thumbnail or screenshot, let’s move to the next section where we understand how to create regular or periodic thumbnails.</p>



<h2><span id="Periodic_Screenshot/Thumbnail_with_Resizing"></span>Periodic Screenshot/Thumbnail with Resizing<span></span></h2>



<p>Here is another common use case that FFmpeg can solve easily – <strong>how do you take screenshots/thumbnails at regular intervals, and store them to JPG files after resizing them?</strong></p>



<p>Here is a simple one-liner that can take care of creating a thumbnail and resizing it for you. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input1080p.mp4 -r 1 -s 1280x720 -f image2 screenshot-%03d.jpg</code></pre>



<p>The <code>-r</code> command sets the output frame rate (=1) and <code>image2</code> is an image file muxer that is used to write video frames to image files. Using the <code>-s 1280x720</code> command, we can resize the video frames before writing them as images. Note, that the input video is a 1920x1080p video.</p>



<p>The above command will take a screenshot every 1 second. The screenshots would be named <code>001</code>, <code>002</code>, etc. because we have specified the formatting as <code>%3d</code>.</p>



<p>However, in my experience, I have found this technique<strong> to be not frame-accurate</strong>.</p>



<p>In the next section, let’s look at a more accurate way of extracting thumbnails. </p>



<h2><span id="Screenshot/Thumbnail_every_10_seconds"></span>Screenshot/Thumbnail every 10 seconds<span></span></h2>



<p>As an extension of the previous section, let’s do a quick exercise and learn how to create a thumbnail every 10 seconds using FFmpeg. </p>



<pre><code><code>ffmpeg -i inputvideo.mp4 -vf "select='not(mod(n,300))',setpts='N/(30*TB)'" -f image2 thumbnail%03d.jpg</code></code></pre>



<p>Here, </p>



<ol><li>we use the <code>select</code> filter to extract a frame if the expression in single-quotes evaluates to non-zero. If the expression is zero, then <code>select</code> filter discards that frame.</li><li><code>mod(A,B)</code>&nbsp;returns the modulus (remainder after division) result after dividing A by B. So, if we divide 0 by 300, we get 0. Then, 1/300 is 1, and so on. </li><li><code>not</code> inverts this result. So, if the modulus is zero, then the final result is <code>1</code>. If the modulus is non-zero, then the result is evaluated to <code>zero</code>. </li><li>Based on this <code>not</code> operation, the <code>select</code> filter picks up a frame. </li></ol>



<p>The sequence I am using has a frame-rate of <code>30 fps</code>. And, I want a frame every 10 seconds. So, I have to choose a frame out of every 300 frames, right? That is why I used <code>select='not(mod(n,300))'</code></p>







<p>Depending on your sequence’s frame-rate, you can modify the command line shown. If you don’t know your video’s frame-rate, you can use <code>ffprobe</code> to find out. </p>



<pre><code>ffprobe -show_entries format=duration globe-with-timestamp.mp4</code></pre>



<h2><span id="Conclusion"></span>Conclusion<span></span></h2>



<p>There you have it – multiple easy ways to generate thumbnails and screenshots using FFmpeg. You can choose to take single screenshots or periodic ones with a highly frame-accurate technique! </p>

<p><i>After every crisis, some of the uncertainty becomes a part of our new reality. How, then, do you adapt and thrive when change is not a choice but inevitability? Let’s see.</i></p><p>Can you believe that Netflix is over two decades old?</p><p>The company has responded to changes (dot-com crash, global financial crisis, COVID-19) in a manner that in every period it seemed it belonged to those times, and sometimes even ahead of them. This once exclusively DVD-by-mail company started to build a streaming service in the early 2000s when most homes didn’t even have internet with enough bandwidth. Anticipating a shift in technology it sensed well in-advance how the consumption of media would change. The results? It has grown from 10m subscribers in 2010 to more than 160m in 2020.</p><p>We are good at finding solutions for today, but when it comes to the future, it’s human nature to see things in a state of positive permanence. Instinctively we tend to underestimate the likelihood of negative events. And this makes us not so good at preparing for uncertainty, much less manage it.</p><p>Successful businesses prepare for the unknown and use uncertain times as a chance to rethink their working norms. The throes of COVID-19 have sent a reminder for business leaders that continual re-examination of ongoing practices and assumptions is paramount.</p><p><b>Here’s a guide to help business strategists act amid uncertainty – and leverage the times to up their adaptability quotient and position themselves for success. </b></p><h4>Resilience: An Antidote for Business Uncertainty</h4><p>Uncertainty brings outcomes we never predicted or saw coming – whether it be a fire breakout and pipe burst or global pandemic. The problem deepens when you are left in limbo and can’t tell for how long the adversity will last, such as the coronavirus pandemic where businesses are still wondering about the shape and extent of economic recovery, and long-term impact on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thestrategyinstitute.org/insights">business models</a> and consumer behavior. After all, what do you hold onto when you make plans in uncertainty? </p><p>In such times, resilience can become a valued characteristic for businesses.</p><p>It is not possible for anyone to be fully prepared for the unknown. But resilient organizations learn to expect the unexpected. It helps them rebound more quickly than others and take first-mover advantage of many opportunities that emerge. </p><p>Resilience is not the resistance to change, but one’s ability to embrace change. And be ready for it. It is reflected in how you react to the uncertainty; how fast you bounce back; and in what health do you remain in afterward. Instead of attempting to preserve what worked in the past, resilient leaders push past their fears, brainstorm new ideas, and embrace large-scale disruption. </p><p>In nutshell, resilience is a sign of an organization’s capacity to come back stronger than ever after having been knocked down by uncertainty. </p><p>But, how do you do that? How do you ensure you that adverse situations bend you, and not break you?</p><p>Resilience starts where new perspective meets experience. It is cumulated in how you look at change. </p><p>Finding a way to rise from the ashes requires rewiring your thinking for resilience and reorganize. We suggest three steps to achieve that.</p><p><img src="https://www.thestrategyinstitute.org/images/survive-adapt.jpg"></p><p> First, make peace with uncertainty. Understand what has changed, what led to it, and the need to get your business back on its foot, instead of staying down and defeated. Then, change your perspective. Swap your question of why this is happening to what it is trying to teach me. Finally, make changes to your present and prepare yourself to better handle the adversity in the future. Focus on growing with new strategies in place.</p><p> Leaders must understand the value of each step for developing resilience in the organization. Those who just rebound and survive may fall into the same trap again when faced with adversity the next time.</p><h4>Ten Sage Advices to Respond to COVID-19 Uncertainty</h4><p> When facts on the ground are incomplete and in flux, what you need to put in place an operational business is experimentation. Develop a culture of responding to uncertainty by rapidly hypothesizing, testing, learning from new trials, and adapting to the models that work. Here are a few actions <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thestrategyinstitute.org/insights/at-crossroads-taking-a-platform-approach-to-business">global business leaders</a> can take in this pandemic to beat the uncertainty blues and become resilient and agile.</p><ul><li><p><b>Operate with a sense of personal safety.</b> Great leadership is always about emotional connection. In this pandemic, as a primary responsibility, ensure that everyone in your organization is safe, secure, and healthy.</p></li><li><p><b> Achieve a level of business continuity.</b> Being functional, staying afloat, and carrying on is crucial in any uncertainty. Find a way to keep going on. Use virtual medium and collaborative tools. Focus on optimizing continuity thereafter.</p></li><li><p><b> Show signs of life.</b> Make your clients and customers know you are well and available.</p></li><li><p><b>Be less promotional &amp; more comforting in your messaging.</b> You can take either a direct marketing approach or you can be more sensitive by deploying a “hope all is well” campaign and the likes. Instead of a sales pitch, most global leaders are opting to touch base by asking about customers’/clients’ wellbeing and informing them of their availability lest they need their product or services.</p></li><li><p><b>Go multichannel and focus on customer-centricity.</b> Make a zero-tolerance declaration in your organization on any internal silos against customer-centricity. Ensure that your employees imbibe that in customers are the top priority in these times. Furthermore, don’t limit yourself to one channel for communication and operations. Experiment to find one or multiple best channels that best suit your needs.</p></li><li><p><b> Stay away from the herd mentality.</b> What is working for one company may not work for you. Find your new normal as you adapt every day. Mercilessly examine your weaknesses and vulnerabilities to become stronger for the long run. Destruct archaic practices to rebuild.</p></li><li><p><b>Keep a cool head.</b> It’s not uncommon for the dropping numbers to get your nerves. Don’t panic in these situations. It’s needless. Take a step back and see what you are left with. Gratitude for what you have can open a new world of possibilities. Look toward the long-term for more motivation.</p></li><li><p><b> Organize for rapid decision-making.</b> Uncertainty catches one off-guard. If you aren’t prepared, a crisis will overwhelm you. Distribute leadership responsibilities across your organization such that your employees are self-motivated and empowered to make decisions and operate with speed. A large part of this change is to give yourself (as an organization) the permission to be wrong in case things go south.</p></li><li><p><b>Make your offerings relevant to the times.</b> Use the uncertainty to gauge where customers’ propensities lie or would change in the future. Leverage new mediums and products/services of their choice to redesign your offerings and innovate.</p></li><li><p><b>Collaboration is the key to build resilience.</b> Startups are seen as a threat by incumbents, and vice-versa. However, a variety of collaborations between startups and incumbents can help each party survive, adapt, and thrive. Right collaboration would make it easy for both to raise capital, reduce cost, and position for growth. Forge joint ventures, or project-based relationship to come up with disruptive value propositions.</p></li></ul><h4> To Sum</h4><p> What type of leadership does uncertainty demand? The answer lies in resilience and agility. Enduring hard times are about leveraging, and not reacting to the turbulence around you. Lead by preparing your teams and organization to recreate the future with you. Adopt a new perspective to carve new normal, set a new vision, and imbibe new practices.</p><p><b> Business strategists who successfully lead their organizations through uncertainty not only survive, but also shields them from future disruptions by growing their adaptability quotient.</b></p>

  <p><span>03 Oct 2020</span></p><p>Disney Animation’s Moana island dataset is a production-scale scene with memory requirements that make it challenging to render. This post summarizes some of those challenges, and describes how the <a href="https://github.com/chellmuth/gpu-motunui">GPU-Motunui</a> project is able to efficiently render the scene on a consumer-grade GPU with less than 8GB of memory. <a href="#renders">Click here</a> to skip ahead to the results.</p>

<h2 id="the-moana-island">The Moana island</h2>

<p>In 2018, Disney Animation released the Moana island dataset to the rendering research community. Compared to traditional research scenes, the scale of the Moana island scene is massive: the scene contains 90 million quad primitives, 5 million curves, and more than 28 million instances. All told, the island consists of over 15 billion primitives, weighing in at just under 30GB of geometry files.</p>

<p>The shots included with the dataset are beautiful, and showcase the amazing imagery that can be created by combining the best artists in the world with path tracing techniques and modern hardware. Here are two reference images, rendered with Disney’s proprietary Hyperion renderer:</p>

</div>

<h2 id="gpu-motunui-project">GPU-Motunui Project</h2>

<p>The goal of the GPU-Motunui project is to render all the Moana shots efficiently and accurately on a consumer-grade graphics card. There are two main challenges to accomplishing this with the Moana dataset. First, with a typical graphics card having only 8GB of memory, an out-of-core rendering solution is required to handle the large amounts of geometry. Second, the scene’s textures are provided in the Ptex format, and Ptex doesn’t have a publicly available CUDA implementation. This project currently only solves the first problem, and Ptex texture lookup is done on the CPU (although conveniently its cost is fully hidden by being computed concurrently with GPU shadow ray tracing).</p>

<p>The Hyperion reference images are impossible to match exactly; for example the varying brown and green colors along the palm tree fronds in the palmsCam shot are not provided in the dataset. Other features of the scene are possible to render but out of my initial scope, notably subdivision surfaces and their displacement maps, and a full Disney BSDF implementation.</p>

<div>

</div>

<p>All ray tracing operations are run through Nvidia’s OptiX 7 API. This means GPU-Motunui gets the full benefits of available RT cores and a world-class BVH implementation. The following sections describe how GPU-Motunui maps dataset assets to OptiX data structures, and how GPU-Motunui’s out-of-core rendering solution works.</p>

<h3 id="scene-representation">Scene representation</h3>

<p>The Moana scene makes widespread use of multi-level instancing. In OptiX, this requires a three-level hierarchy of acceleration structures to manage: two levels of IASs, and a base level of GASs (Instance Acceleration Structures and Geometry Acceleration Structures, respectively). GPU-Motunui makes use of OptiX’s AS compaction and relocation APIs to further reduce memory usage.</p>

<p>The isHibiscus element makes a good example of how a typical element in the scene is organized and built. The tree is assembled from a base model in one Wavefront .obj file (containing the trunk and branches), and four primitives: one flower and three leaf models (each with their own .obj file).</p>

<div>

<p>Left: The four simple primitives that will be instanced to fill out the hibiscus tree <br>Right: The base trunk and branches model </p>
</div>

<p>In OptiX, each of these models has an associated GAS, and each GAS can be subdivided into multiple build inputs. Build inputs are used to map sections of the model to information needed at shading time by indexing into OptiX’s shader binding table. These GASs form the bottom level of the hierarchy.</p>

<p>Next, an IAS is used to build the full isHibiscus element. This IAS is in the middle level of the hierarchy. The figure below shows each primitive’s instances in isolation, and combined to make the full element:</p>

<div>

<p>Left: Isolated instances for each primitive<br>Right: Full isHibiscus element</p>
</div>

<p>Finally, a second IAS is built to track all of the element’s instances present in the scene. This second IAS is the top level of the instance hierarchy.</p>

<div>
  <p><img src="https://www.render-blog.com/assets/isHibiscus-instanced-elements.png" alt="The shotCam view rendered with only isHibiscus instances"></p><p>The shotCam view rendered with only isHibiscus instances</p>
</div>

<p>Although the isHibiscus element has a typical structure, there are some more complicated elements included in the dataset. The isCoral element, for example, has different base geometry and instanced primitives for each of its element instances, but the underlying primitive geometries are shared across all the element instances.</p>

<p>The Moana GAS and IASs alone require 18.5 GB, well past the memory budget of my 8GB RTX 2070. Because OptiX has no native support for out-of-core rendering, the traditional OptiX pipeline had to be put aside for a custom-made solution.</p>

<h3 id="out-of-core-rendering">Out-of-core rendering</h3>

<p>To solve the out-of-core rendering problem, GPU-Motunui divides the scene’s geometry into different sections, and ray traces each separately, while tracking the closest hit. Replacing a traditional device trace call with a host loop comes with many design consequences to the renderer, from asset loading to the core path tracing loop that sends rays through the scene.</p>

<p>Before rendering, the asset loading process allocates a large chunk of GPU memory (currently 6.7GB). A custom allocator is implemented that manages this block of memory. It is responsible for allocating two types of memory: output and temporary. Output memory is allocated from the left of the block, and is used for OptiX structures. Temporary memory is managed on a stack from the right end of the memory block. Managing the temporary memory this way ensures that the output structures are always tightly packed.</p>

<p>After elements are processed into their accelerator structures on the GPU, their used memory is snapshotted onto the host, and the allocator is cleared. The process is repeated until all of the scene’s geometry is processed, resulting in the host managing a list of GPU memory snapshots. The figure below shows an example layout of GPU memory that could be snapshotted:</p>

<div>
  <p>GPU memory layout after loading the isHibiscus element.<br>(Dotted arrows show that an IAS holds instances of the pointed-at AS)</p>

</div>

<p>As mentioned above, when it comes time to ray trace, each snapshot is processed in a loop. This means a call to <code>cudaMemcpy</code> and <code>optixLaunch</code> for each snapshot. A global buffer is maintained that indicates the depth of the current closest intersection. This value is used as the <code>tmax</code> parameter for the CUDA kernel’s call to <code>optixTrace</code>, and a successful intersection will update the depth buffer for the next launch.</p>

<p>In a traditional OptiX path tracer, the entire render loop can run in device code inside a single call to <code>optixLaunch</code>; i.e., a successful intersection will lead to more BSDF and shadow rays being traced in the same kernel launch. Because GPU-Motunui’s design mandates multiple launches for tracing each path segment, the render loop is pulled out into host code. While this potentially diminishes OptiX’s ability to efficiently schedule program execution, it also opens up opportunties for optimization, such as running Ptex texture lookups on the CPU concurrently with GPU kernels and I/O.</p>

<h3 id="shading">Shading</h3>
<p>As with any OptiX application, GPU-Motunui makes use of the shader binding table (SBT). SBT records contain pointers to normal buffers and material attributes. The underlying data for the normal buffers is stored alongside OptiX acceleration structures and included in geometry snapshots. This ensures that GPU memory is never wasted on unreachable normal buffer data.</p>

<h2 id="renders">Renders</h2>
<p>Included below are GPU-Motunui renders of the six scenes included in the dataset. shotCam is the slowest to render at 18.2 seconds per sample at 1024x429 resolution, and took just over five hours total for the final image. All shots are 1024spp, capped at a maximum of five bounces, and were run on an Nvidia RTX 2070.</p>

<h2 id="optimization">Optimization</h2>
<p>The initial implementation of the renderer required 42.6 seconds per 1spp on the shotCam scene. A few optimizations combined to make significant reductions in rendering time, cutting each pass down to 18.2 seconds (a 57.3% reduction).</p>

<h4 id="cpugpu-concurrency">CPU/GPU concurrency</h4>
<p>Tracing shadow rays on the GPU in parallel with Ptex lookups on the CPU cut rendering time by 23.4%. It was disappointing to be forced to do texture lookups on the CPU, but the time savings make up for it.</p>

<h4 id="multiple-ptex-caches">Multiple Ptex caches</h4>
<p>Parallelizing the Ptex lookups and using multiple Ptex caches eliminated texture lookups as a bottleneck to the system; shadow ray casting time fully dominates the texture lookup. Empirically, spawning two threads per core (totaling 12 on an Intel i7-8700K) and sharing three Ptex caches comfortably reduced the texture lookup time beneath the shadow ray budget. This improved the time savings to a 33.9% reduction over the baseline.</p>

<h4 id="pinned-memory">Pinned memory</h4>
<p>The acceleration structure snapshots are all saved to pinned host memory. Switching from normal to pinned host memory increased the transfer throughput from 7.73 GB/s to 11.84 GB/s, cutting the baseline render time by 19.5%.</p>

<h2 id="future-steps">Future Steps</h2>
<p>Getting this scene running on my RTX 2070 card was a very fun and rewarding project, but there are still many improvements to be made:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implementing the Disney BSDF</li>
  <li>Rendering subdivision surfaces along with displacement mapping</li>
  <li>More efficiently packing the acceleration structures, and optimizing ray tracing throughput</li>
  <li>Experimenting with how various research results hold up on production scenes (e.g., testing select path guiding techniques)</li>
</ul>

Although <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/">Ghost(Pro)</a> is a strong choice if you have paying subscribers, it is impossible to beat static hosting for a simple blog. Static sites are fast, secure, and free.</p><p>Here's a quick rundown of my reasoning and approach - from editing in Ghost's world-class UI to deploying for free on a static hosting provider like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.</p><h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2><p>I was looking for a blogging solution that met these requirements:</p><ul><li><strong>Slick UI:</strong> Even though I use vim and markdown daily, I prefer a Medium-like freeform writing experience.</li><li><strong>Self-hosted: </strong>Full control of my content with no vendor lock-in, paywalls, or subscription pop-ups.</li><li><strong>High availability:</strong> I should never receive a monitoring alert for my personal blog.</li><li><strong>Exceptional performance:</strong> I want the page to load fast!</li><li><strong>Secure and low-maintenance:</strong> After supporting dozens of WordPress sites over more than a decade, I have grown weary of hacked plugins and frequent patching cycles.</li></ul><h2 id="static-ghost-io-">Static Ghost.io 👻</h2><p>Even though I use markdown every day in my work, I prefer the WYSIWYG writing experience of a web UI. Ghost's UI is fantastic!</p><figure><img src="https://www.nedmcclain.com/content/images/2020/10/nm_ghost.png"></figure><p>The main drawback of Ghost is the same as WordPress: every request depends on a database. Each time a user visits a page on the site, the following steps take place:</p><ol><li>The web server passes the end user's request to a running application server (Node.js for Ghost, PHP for WordPress).</li><li>The application server analyzes the incoming request and dispatches requests to the database for necessary content (MySQL for Ghost).</li><li>The application server renders the content from the database into a web page.</li><li>The web server passes the resulting page back to the end user.</li></ol><p>This architecture requires significant compute and memory resources on both the application server and database server. &nbsp;It is susceptible to performance issues due to spikes in demand. And achieving high availability requires a database cluster and web load balancer. Lots of distinct parts to deploy, secure, and operate.</p><p>The advent of the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMstack</a> architecture has brought static sites into the limelight. By moving steps 2 and 3 <strong>to the beginning</strong>, Ghost can generate each page on the site <strong>in advance</strong>. Then, it's easy to upload the static site to a free or almost-free hosting provider (see below for suggestions).</p><blockquote>Fast and secure sites and apps delivered by pre-rendering files and serving them directly from a CDN, removing the requirement to manage or run web servers. - JAMstack</blockquote><p>Static sites have a significantly smaller attack surface than sites driven by databases and application code. Bugs, vulnerabilities, and build issues can be identified by the build phase, rather than when the site is live. </p><p>You get the rich editing of Ghost while enjoying all of the operational and cost advantages of a static JAM site:</p><ul><li>Never worry about scaling when traffic spikes.</li><li>Never apply a critical security patch at midnight.</li><li>Who cares if your Ghost database is temporarily down?</li></ul><h2 id="making-ghost-static">Making Ghost Static</h2><p>First, setup a <a href="https://ghost.org/docs/setup/">private Ghost instance</a> to use for editing, formatting, and peer review. This can be a very small VM, since it doesn't have to serve any production traffic. Defying traditional best-practices, it's even safe to co-locate MySQL on the same system! <a href="https://valet.ghost.org/">Ghost(Valet)</a> is very reasonably priced if you need a hand with this step.</p><p>You can secure access to this system with a firewall or VPN. A better approach is to use an authentication proxy like <a href="https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy">oauth2-proxy</a> or <a href="https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium">pomerium</a> for a user-friendly, "zero trust" solution.</p><p>Then, use Ghost Static Site Generator (<code>gssg</code>) &nbsp;to create a static mirror of the site that is hosted by Netlify:</p><figure><a href="https://github.com/Fried-Chicken/ghost-static-site-generator"><div><p>Fried-Chicken/ghost-static-site-generator</p><p>Generate a static site from ghost and deploy using a CI - Fried-Chicken/ghost-static-site-generator</p><p><img src="https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg"><span>GitHub</span></p></div><p><img src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/19606031?s=400&amp;v=4"></p></a></figure><p><code>gssg</code> will spider your local Ghost site, creating a fully static copy.

      <section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>So first off a personal update – last year, I got laid off the day I returned from maternity leave! Within a half hour of returning to my desk! Whew boy! It was a blessing in disguise in some ways, because 1) I’d been thinking for some time I could be more effective in a consulting role and 2) as part of my severance package, I got to attend a General Assembly coding bootcamp.</p>

<p>I ended up auditing the bootcamp because wow, it demands a ton of sacrifice with the end goal of getting a developer job. In contrast, I am happy to do a bit of scripting on the side, work with developers, and improve their experiences. Nonetheless, I worked through all the lectures, did a few homework assignments, and got a lot out of it. Not the least of which is that I validated my existing coding skills, gained deeper insight into the “junior developer” persona, and reaffirmed my conviction that tailoring your developer experience and docs to junior developers is a <strong>Good Thing</strong>.</p>

<p>There are a couple of big takeaways I’d like to share:</p>

<h3 id="everyone-is-a-junior-developer">Everyone is a junior developer</h3>

<p>Well, no, not actually … but every developer has to learn new concepts.  And yes, of course, as you gain experience as a developer, “totally new” concepts get rarer and rarer. Still, there’s a lot of learning:</p>

<p>Some developers must learn a breakneck pace (think of all the Javascript frameworks coming out all the time! Those front-end folks have to sprint just to stay in place). Others face big disruptions to their coding world only occasionally (your Enterprise Java programmer with a 20 year career in monolithic app development who now lives in a brave new world of microservices, CI/CD, devops, oh my!)</p>

<p>I felt I experienced this disruption myself as part of the coding bootcamp. Up till then, my background was in writing Python scripts, and in documenting big Java applications in a analytics microservices context. I knew about RedHat, Docker, Kubernetes, Spark, Lucene, Cassandra, etc.</p>

<p>Now, I was learning about a whole new world: the ecosystems, the mindset, the business of ….  JavaScript.  Like probably many people outside the JavaScript world, I was fooled by the “script” part of the name – especially since I’d only used JavaScript myself to write macros in an XML docs tool.  Now I realize it’s <a href="https://www.javaworld.com/article/2886368/java-vs-nodejs-an-epic-battle-for-developer-mindshare.html">epic battle</a> between Java and JavaScript. And while I haven’t fallen in love (Python, you still have my heart), I had lots of “oh, that’s neat!” moments. I also recognized that my learning curve was not dissimilar to that of experienced – but JavaScript-naïve – developers.</p>

<p>Which brings me to my main point:</p>

<h3 id="we-should-all-design-for-the-junior-developer">We should all design for the junior developer</h3>

<p>Creating experiences with a junior developer in mind forces you to discard your comfy assumption that everyone’s drunk your product Kool-aid. If you assume you’re writing for someone who’s technically savvy and can learn quickly, but who knows nothing about your world, you’re positioning yourself to vastly decrease your developer onboarding friction. And if you assume that your “junior developer” is super impatient because they have, like, 10 other things on the docket to learn about, then you’ll learn to answer up front the question: “why should I care? Why should I do this work?”</p>

<p>It’s a fine line to tread, assuming not too much about technical knowledge, but also not coming across as condescending or silly (like, at the level of “open a terminal by taking the following steps…”). Still, I think it’s actually quite achievable. For example, it’s quite low effort to provide high-level context for coding instructions. Even something as simple as “Clone this repository and open a terminal at the local directory location” is a direction that often gets left out in GitHub readmes…but it really shouldn’t be left out.  And it never hurts to link to frameworks’ getting started guides, even if you don’t want to provide the details yourself. At the very least, no one is likely to roll their eyes at it, and it helps your reader understand what level of granularity your instructions will provide.</p>

<p>When I look for inspiration, I think the <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">React newbie tutorials</a> do an outstanding job of introducing junior developers to React, helping them understand why they should care, and explicitly stating their audience. I also really love (who doesn’t) the <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/register">Stripe developer onboarding</a> experience.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think I came away from the coding bootcamp more confident that I <em>am</em> a junior developer. And while I’d never make the classic UX mistake of thinking I am the user, still – my confusions, my pain points in learning about a product– these are things that other developers likely share.</p>

<h3 id="postscript-fun-with-javascript">Postscript: Fun with Javascript!</h3>

<p>I’ll end on another personal note. The coding bootcamp turned out to be quite serendipitous, because I took on contracting work that immediately benefited from my new knowledge. I’d just learned about Express, and now here I was, entering a pull request to change the authentication method for an Express server. I’d just learned about React, and now here I was, wading into a web UI to change some text. It’s always nice when you can put what you’ve learned to immediate use.</p>

<p>
Somewhere in the concrete canyons of New York City a
recently formed rock group is using the name Jim Jones and
the Suicides. Irreverent and disarming, the name reflects
the new trend in punk rock, to take social issues head on.
Cynicism about the Jonestown deaths and its social
parallels abound in the lyrics of today's music. The
messages are clear because we all know the story.

</p><div><p>
In fact, people today recognize the name "Jonestown"
more than any other event, a full 98% of the population.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn1">1</a>]</span>
The television and printed media were filled with the news
for more than a year, even though the tale read like
something from the <i>National Enquirer</i> tabloid. But
despite all the coverage, the reality of Jonestown and the
reasons behind the bizarre events remain a mystery. The
details have faded from memory for most of us since
November 18, 1978, but not the outlines. Think back a
moment and you'll remember.

<br>
<a name="p1">
</a></p><p>

<b>
<span face="arial,helvetica">
You Know the Official Version
</span>
</b></p></div><p>
A fanatic religious leader in California led a
multiracial community into the jungles of remote Guyana to
establish a socialist utopia. The People's Temple, his
church, was in the heart of San Francisco and drew poor
people, social activists, Blacks and Hispanics, young and
old. The message was racial harmony and justice, and
criticism of the hypocrisy of the world around his
followers.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn2">2</a>]</span>

</p><p>
The Temple rose in a vacuum of leadership at the end of
an era.  The political confrontations of the 60s were
almost over, and religious cults and "personal
transformation" were on the rise. Those who had preached a
similar message on the political soap box were gone, burnt
out, discredited, or dead. The counter-culture had
apparently degenerated into drugs and violence. Charlie
Manson was the only visible image of the period. Suddenly,
religion seemed to offer a last hope.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn3">3</a>]</span>

</p><p>
Even before they left for the Jonestown site, the
People's Temple members were subjects of local scandal in
the news.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn4">4</a>]</span> Jim Jones claimed these exposés were
attacks on their newly-found religion, and used them as an
excuse to move most of the members to Guyana.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn5">5</a>]</span> But
disturbing reports continued to surround Jones, and soon
came to the attention of congressional members like Leo
Ryan. Stories of beatings, kidnapping, sexual abuse and
mysterious deaths leaked out in the press.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn6">6</a>]</span> Ryan decided
to go to Guyana and investigate the situation for himself.
The nightmare began.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn7">7</a>]</span>

</p><p>
Isolated on the tiny airstrip at Port Kaituma, Ryan and
several reporters in his group were murdered. Then came the
almost unbelievable "White Night," a mass suicide pact of
the Jonestown camp. A community made up mostly of Blacks
and women drank cyanide from paper cups of <i>Kool-Aid</i>,
adults and children alike died and fell around the main
pavilion. Jones himself was shot in the head, an apparent
suicide. For days, the body count mounted, from 400 to
nearly 1,000. The bodies were flown to the United States
and later cremated or buried in mass graves.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn8">8</a>]</span>

</p><p>
Temple member Larry Layton is still facing charges of
conspiracy in Ryan's murder. Ryan was recently awarded a
posthumous Medal of Honor, and was the first Congress
member to die in the line of duty.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn9">9</a>]</span>

</p><div><p>
Pete Hammill called the corpses "all the loose change
of the sixties."<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn10">10</a>]</span> The effect was electric. Any
alternative to the current system was seen as futile, if
not deadly. Protest only led to police riots and political
assassination. Alternative life styles and drugs led to
"creepy-crawly" communes and violent murders.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn11">11</a>]</span> And
religious experiments led to cults and suicide. Social
utopias were dreams that turned into nightmares. The
television urged us to go back to "The Happy Days" of the
apolitical 50s. The message was, get a job, and go back to
church.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn12">12</a>]</span> The unyielding nuclear threat generated only
nihilism and hopelessness. There was no answer but death,
no exit from the grisly future. The new ethic was personal
success, aerobics, material consumption, a return to
"American values," and the "moral majority" white Christian
world.  The official message was clear.

<span face="arial,helvetica">
But Just Suppose 
<br>
It Didn't Happen That Way...
</span>
</b></p></div><p>
The headlines the day of the massacre read: "Cult Dies
in South American Jungle: 400 Die in Mass Suicide, 700 Flee
into Jungle."<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn13">13</a>]</span> By all accounts in the press, as well as
People's Temple statements there were at least 1,100 people
at Jonestown.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn14">14</a>]</span> There were 809 adult passports found
there, and reports of 300 children (276 found among the
dead, and 210 never identified). The headline figures from
the first day add to the same number: 1,100.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn15">15</a>]</span>
The original body count done by the Guyanese was 408, and this figure
was initially agreed to by U.S. Army authorities on
site.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn16">16</a>]</span>
However, over the next few days, the total of reported dead began to
rise quickly. The Army made a series of misleading and openly false
statements about the discrepancy. The new total, which was the official
final count, was given almost a week later by American authorities as
913.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn17">17</a>]</span>
A total of 16 survivors were reported to have returned to the
U.S.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn18">18</a>]</span> Where were the others?

</p><p>
At their first press conference, the Americans claimed
that the Guyanese "could not count." These local people had
carried out the gruesome job of counting the bodies, and
later assisted American troops in the process of poking
holes in the flesh lest they explode from the gasses of
decay.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn19">19</a>]</span> Then the Americans proposed another theory --
they had missed seeing a pile of bodies at the back of the
pavilion. The structure was the size of a small house, and
they had been at the scene for days.  Finally, we were
given the official reason for the discrepancy -- bodies had
fallen on top of other bodies, adults covering
children.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn20">20</a>]</span>

</p><p>
It was a simple, if morbid, arithmetic that led to the
first suspicions. The 408 bodies discovered at first count
would have to be able to cover 505 bodies for a total of
913. In addition, those who first worked on the bodies
would have been unlikely to miss bodies lying beneath each
other since each body had to be punctured. Eighty-two of
the bodies first found were those of children, reducing the
number that could have been hidden below others.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn21">21</a>]</span> A
search of nearly 150 photographs, aerial and close-up,
fails to show even one body lying under another, much less
500.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn22">22</a>]</span>

</p><p>
It seemed the first reports were true, 400 had died,
and 700 had fled to the jungle. The American authorities
claimed to have searched for people who had escaped, but
found no evidence of any in the surrounding area.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn23">23</a>]</span> At
least a hundred Guyanese troops were among the first to
arrive, and they were ordered to search the jungle for
survivors.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn24">24</a>]</span> In the area, at the same time, British Black
Watch troops were on "training exercises," with nearly 600
of their best-trained commandos. Soon, American Green
Berets were on site as well.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn25">25</a>]</span> The presence of these
soldiers, specially trained in covert killing operations,
may explain the increasing numbers of bodies that
appeared.

</p><p>
Most of the photographs show the bodies in neat rows,
face down. There are few exceptions. Close shots indicate
drag marks, as though the bodies were positioned by someone
after death.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn26">26</a>]</span> Is it possible that the 700 who fled were
rounded up by these troops, brought back to Jonestown and
added to the body count?<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn27">27</a>]</span>

</p><p>
If so, the bodies would indicate the cause of death. A
new word was coined by the media, "suicide-murder." But
which was it?<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn28">28</a>]</span> Autopsies and forensic science are a
developing art. The detectives of death use a variety of
scientific methods and clues to determine how people die,
when they expire, and the specific cause of death. Dr.
Mootoo, the top Guyanese pathologist, was at Jonestown
within hours after the massacre. Refusing the assistance of
U.S. pathologists, he accompanied the teams that counted
the dead, examined the bodies, and worked to identify the
deceased. While the American press screamed about the
"Kool-Aid Suicides," Dr. Mootoo was reaching a much
different opinion.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn29">29</a>]</span>

</p><p>
There are certain signs that show the types of poisons
that lead to the end of life. Cyanide blocks the messages
from the brain to the muscles by changing body chemistry in
the central nervous system. Even the "involuntary"
functions like breathing and heartbeat get mixed neural
signals. It is a painful death, breath coming in spurts.
The other muscles spasm, limbs twist and contort. The
facial muscles draw back into a deadly grin, called
"cyanide rictus."<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn30">30</a>]</span> All these telling signs were absent
in the Jonestown dead. Limbs were limp and relaxed, and the
few visible faces showed no sign of distortion.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn31">31</a>]</span>

</p><p>
Instead, Dr. Mootoo found fresh needle marks at the
back of the left shoulder blades of 80-90% of the
victims.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn32">32</a>]</span> Others had been shot or strangled. One
survivor reported that those who resisted were forced by
armed guards.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn33">33</a>]</span> The gun that reportedly shot Jim Jones
was lying nearly 200 feet from his body, not a likely
suicide weapon.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn34">34</a>]</span> As Chief Medical Examiner, Mootoo's
testimony to the Guyanese grand jury investigating
Jonestown led to their conclusion that all but three of the
people were murdered by "persons unknown." Only two had
committed suicide they said.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn35">35</a>]</span> Several pictures show the
gun-shot wounds on the bodies as well.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn36">36</a>]</span> The U.S. Army
spokesman, Lt. Col. Schuler, said, "No autopsies are
needed. The cause of death is not an issue here." The
forensic doctors who later did autopsies at Dover,
Delaware, were never made aware of Dr. Mootoo's
findings.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn37">37</a>]</span>

</p><p>
There are other indications that the Guyanese
government participated with American authorities in a
cover-up of the real story, despite their own findings. One
good example was Guyanese Police Chief Lloyd Barker, who
interfered with investigations, helped "recover" 2.5
million for the Guyanese government, and was often the
first to officially announce the cover stories relating to
suicide, body counts and survivors.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn38">38</a>]</span> Among the first to
the scene were the wife of Guyanese Prime …</p></td></tr></tbody></div></div>

<p><a href="https://multicorewareinc.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="MulticoreWare (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">MulticoreWare</a> is a multi-faceted company with expertise in different verticals such as high-performance Video Compression, AI &amp; Video Analytics, ADAS (Automated Driver Assistance), etc. A common thread through these verticals is their ability to design and write high-performance code for various computing platforms. MulticoreWare’s background and experience are cool, in my opinion, and how they’ve nurtured and built a strong team in a very complex niche is admirable.</p>



<p>With teams in the US, India, China, and Germany, MulticoreWare is well-placed to don the role of a thought-leader in the open-source video codec world.</p>



<p>Let’s see why and what their plans are!</p>



<h2><span id="The_Road_To_x266_%E2%80%93_An_Open_Source_VVC_Encoder"></span><strong>The Road To x266 – An Open Source VVC Encoder</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>MPEG announced three new video codecs – VVC (Versatile Video Coding), EVC (Essential Video Coding), and LCEVC (Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding). Of these three, VVC or H.266 is touted as the successor to H.265 (HEVC) and promises 50% more compression efficiency over HEVC but comes at a much higher complexity. Here’s a <a href="https://ottverse.com/vvc-evc-lcevc-mpeg-video-codecs/">brief explanation of all three</a> on OTTVerse.</p>



<p>But, first, let’s take a look at HEVC and the x265 encoder.</p>



<h3><span id="x265_and_HEVC"></span><strong>x265 and HEVC</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>MulticoreWare announced the <a href="https://x265.com/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">x265 project</a> back in 2013, and it was a success. x265 allowed video compression teams worldwide to get their hands on an efficient, standards-compliant HEVC encoder. x265 was made available under the open-source <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">GNU GPL v2 license</a> and also offered by MulticoreWare under Commercial License Agreements.</p>



<p>But, having a good encoder clearly wasn’t enough. Because, fast-forward 7 years, and unfortunately, HEVC is still embroiled in patent-wars that seem destined to give it a “death by a thousand cuts.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>HEVC’s situation is rather unfortunate considering that HEVC had interesting features such as the use of quadtree-decomposition, large block sizes, the concept of TU, PU, and CUs, the Sample Adaptive Offset filter, new picture types, and several innovations which made it possible to compress 4K videos quite efficiently (in comparison to H.264/AVC).</p>



<h3><span id="The_x266_Project"></span><strong>The x266 Project</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>Riding on the back of their x265 success, MulticoreWare has decided to pioneer the x266 project along the x265 project lines they worked on earlier. x266 will be an open-source project with the MulticoreWare video compression team’s full attention and the backing of an industry-consortium.</p>



<p>As with any new codec, there are always early adopters (both programmers and companies) willing to give it a try, evaluate, file tickets, and contribute code. But, to get the ball rolling, you need a reliable encoder that is not only standards-compliant but also reasonably fast and with enough presets and knobs to make the early-adoption both valuable and exciting (in a geeky-sense!)</p>



<p>I spoke to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivakumarasu/" target="_blank" aria-label="Shivakumar Narayanan (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shivakumar Narayanan</a>, Senior Director – Marketing and Product Management at MulticoreWare, about the consortium, and this is what he had to say –</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Similar to when we did this for x265 consortium, to get key consortium members on board and invest in the development of this codec. These members will be founding partners with benefits when the codec (rather encoder is ready to release for the open-source world). Consortium members being strategic, will also play an important role in the shaping of this codec as well as prioritization of functionalities as it would pertain to their and their customers’ interests.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Industry involvement bodes well for the open-source community because <strong>video encoder implementation is both an art and a science.</strong></p>



<p>It helps to have a proficient team that understands and implements concepts such as wavefront parallelism, multi-threading, intrinsics, etc. to make codec implementations practical and useful. And, of course, people with “golden eyes” to spot issues with video quality as they occur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MulticoreWare has such a team, and I feel they’ll bring their experience from x265 to the x266 development.</p>



<h3><span id="Expertise_from_UHDKit"></span><strong>Expertise from UHDKit</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>Another product in MulticoreWare’s portfolio is <a href="https://x265.com/uhdkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UHDKit</a>. It is an extended encoding library built on top of the x264 (AVC) encoder and x265 (HEVC) encoder libraries. It has a better performance and feature-set than the vanilla x264, x265, and svt-av1 encoders. UHDKit comes in-built with powerful features such as a “control system for video compression” that dynamically adjusts settings to achieve better video quality based on the computing platform’s spec. </p>



<p>Additional features include fast ABR encoding (to get the bitrate ladder faster!) and high-performance live encoding, all this on software, without any requirement for additional hardware accelerators. It can be used as a standalone encoding library or can be invoked via the FFmpeg framework, which makes it seamlessly integrate into any software encoding/ transcoding pipeline.</p>



<p>I am sure some of this expertise from building UHDKit will rub off on the x266 encoder development.</p>



<h2><span id="How_Do_I_Get_my_hands_on_x266"></span><strong>How Do I Get my hands on x266?</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>Currently, MulticoreWare is working closely with x266 Consortium members and after a few months, it will be available to them.</p>



<p>Upon enquiring about the open-source implementation, here’s what MCW had to say –</p>



<blockquote><p><em>For the larger open source community, it will be made available when we have reached critical mass required for its first release. As we near readiness, we will update here on how you can get hold of it.</em></p></blockquote>

October 19, 2020 | https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/assorted-thoughts-on-zig-and-rust/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/assorted-thoughts-on-zig-and-rust/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>I've been using <a href="https://ziglang.org/">zig</a> for ~4 months worth of side projects, including a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/focus/tree">toy text editor</a> and an <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/imp">interpreter for a relational language</a>. I've written ~10kloc.</p>
<p>That's not nearly enough time to form a coherent informed opinion. So instead here is an incoherent assortment of thoughts and experiences, in no particular order :)</p>
<p>This is not meant to be an introduction to zig - check out the excellent <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/">language docs</a> or the new <a href="https://ziglearn.org/">ziglearn.org</a> instead. I'll try to focus instead on things that are not immediately obvious from reading intro material.</p>
<p>The obvious point of comparison is to rust. For context, I've been using rust <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/three-months-of-rust/">since 2015</a>. Mostly in research positions writing throwaway code, but also ~14 months working on <a href="https://materialize.io/">a commercial database</a> which is ~100kloc.</p>
<hr>
<p>Zig is dramatically simpler than rust. It took a few days before I felt proficient vs a month or more for rust.</p>
<p>Most of this difference is <strong>not</strong> related to lifetimes. Rust has patterns, traits, dyn, modules, declarative macros, procedural macros, derive, associated types, annotations, cfg, cargo features, turbofish, autoderefencing, deref coercion etc. I encountered most of these in the first week. Just understanding how they all work is a significant time investment, let alone learning when to use each and how they affect the available design space.</p>
<p>I still haven't internalized the full rule-set of rust enough to be able predict whether a design in my head will successfully compile. I don't remember the order in which methods are resolved during autoderefencing, or how module visibility works, or how the type system determines if one impl might <a href="https://github.com/Ixrec/rust-orphan-rules#what-are-the-orphan-rules">overlap another or be an orphan</a>. There are frequent moments where I know what I want the machine to do but struggle to encode it into traits and lifetimes.</p>
<p>Zig manages to provide many of the same features with a single mechanism - compile-time execution of regular zig code. This comes will all kinds of pros and cons, but one large and important pro is that I already know how to write regular code so it's easy for me to just write down the thing that I want to happen.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the key differences between zig and rust is that when writing a generic function, rust will prove that the function is type-safe for every possible value of the generic parameters. Zig will prove that the function is type-safe only for each parameter that you actually call the function with.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this allows zig to make use of arbitrary compile-time logic where rust has to restrict itself to structured systems (traits etc) about which it can form general proofs. This in turn allows zig a great deal of expressive power and also massively simplifies the language.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can't type-check zig libraries which contain generics. We can only type-check specific uses of those libraries.</p>
<pre><span>// This function is typesafe if there exist no odd perfect numbers
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number#Odd_perfect_numbers
fn foo(comptime n: comptime_int, i: usize) usize {
  const j = if (comptime is_odd_perfect_number(n)) "surprise!" else 1;
  return i + j;
}
</span></pre>
<p>This means zig also doesn't get the automatic, machine-checked documentation of type constraints that rust benefits from and may face more challenges providing IDE support.</p>
<p>This might harm the zig ecosystem by making it harder to compose various libraries. But <a href="https://julialang.org/">julia</a> has a similar model and in practice it has worked very well (<a href="https://youtu.be/dmWQtI3DFFo?t=1710">eg</a>, <a href="https://www.oxinabox.net/2020/02/09/whycompositionaljulia.html">eg</a>).</p>
<hr>
<p>Zig's comptime allows expressing <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/open-multiple-dispatch-in-zig/">open multiple dispatch</a> as a library.</p>
<p>It should be relatively trivial to implement specialization the same way, which has been a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31844">work in progress</a> in rust for years and is critical to many optimizations in julia's math libraries.</p>
<p>Julia chose dynamic typing because it's very difficult to encode the types of various mathematical operations into a general schema (eg fortress <a href="https://youtu.be/EZD3Scuv02g?t=3011">struggled with this</a>). Zig's approach of not requiring general schemas but still type-checking individual cases may be an interesting sweet spot.</p>
<hr>
<p>I used the <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1350.html">2020 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses</a> to get a sense of the relative frequency of different causes of memory unsafety.</p>
<p>(I'm assuming that the zig programmer is using release-safe mode instead of the unfortunately named release-fast mode which disables all runtime safety checks.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Out-of-bounds Write (787/1350)</li>
<li>Out-of-bounds Read (125/1350)</li>
<li>Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (119/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both languages primarily use bounds-checked slices and relegate pointer arithmetic to a separate type (<code>*T</code> in rust, <code>[*]T</code> in zig).</p>
<ul>
<li>NULL Pointer Dereference (476/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both languages require explicit annotations for nulls (<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> in rust, <code>?T</code> in zig) and require code to either handle the null case or safely crash on null (<code>x.unwrap()</code> in rust, <code>x.?</code> in zig).</p>
<p>Dereferencing/casting a null c pointer is undefined behavior in both languages, but is checked at runtime in zig.</p>
<ul>
<li>Integer Overflow or Wraparound (190/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Rust catches overflow in debug and wraps in release. Zig catches overflow in debug/release-safe and leaves behavior undefined in release-fast.</p>
<p>Both languages allow explicitly asking for wraparound (<code>x.wrapping_add(1)</code> in rust, <code>x +% 1</code> in zig).</p>
<ul>
<li>Use After Free (416/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as all unsafe code obeys the aliasing and lifetime rules, rust protects completely against UAF.</p>
<p>Zig has little protection. The recently merged
<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/575fbd5e3592cff70cbfc5153884d919e6bed89f/lib/std/heap/general_purpose_allocator.zig">GeneralPurposeAllocator</a> avoids reusing memory regions (which prevents freed data from being overwritten) and reusing pages (which means that UAF will eventually result in a page fault). But this comes at the cost of fragmentation and lower performance and it also won't provide protection for child allocators using the GPA as a backing allocator.</p>
<hr>
<p>Both languages will insert implicit casts between primitive types and pointers whenever it is safe to do so, and require explicit casts otherwise. (With the odd exception that rust will not implicitly upcast numbers).</p>
<p>Both languages support generics which almost entirely avoids the need to cast void pointers.</p>
<hr>
<p>In rust the Send/Sync traits flag types which are safe to move/share across threads. In the absence of unsafe code it should be impossible to cause data races.</p>
<p>Zig has no comparable protection. It's possible to implement the same logic as Send/Sync in comptime zig, but without the ability to track ownership the rules would have to be much more restrictive.</p>
<hr>
<p>Rust prevents having multiple mutable references to the same memory region at the same time.</p>
<p>This means that eg iterator invalidation is prevented at compile time, because the borrow checker won't allow mutating a data-structure while an iterator is holding a reference to the data-structure. Similarly for resizing a data-structure while holding a reference to the old allocation. Both examples are easy sources of UAF in zig.</p>
<hr>
<p>Neither language is able to produce stack traces for stack overflows at the moment (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/51405">rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1616">zig</a>)</p>
<p>In the future zig is <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1006">intended</a> to statically check the maximum stack usage of your program and force recursive code to explicitly allocate space on the heap, so that stack overflows produce a recoverable OutOfMemory error rather than a crash.</p>
<p>This is not an academic problem - I've seen real-world crashes from recursive tree transformations in compilers (<a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/pull/3996">eg</a>) and it's often painful to write the same logic without recursion.</p>
<hr>
<p>Undefined behavior in rust is defined <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/what-unsafe-does.html">here</a>. It's worth noting that breaking the aliasing rules in unsafe rust can cause undefined behavior but these rules are not yet well-defined. So far this hasn't caused me any problems but it is a little unnerving.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">Miri</a> is an interpreter for rusts Mid-level Intermediate Representation which will detect many (but not all) cases of undefined behavior in unsafe rust. It's far too slow to use for the whole materialize test suite but was useful for unit-testing an unsafe module.</p>
<p>Undefined behavior in zig is defined <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Undefined-Behavior">here</a>. This list is <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1966">probably incomplete</a> given that the core language is still under development.</p>
<p>Zig <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2301">aspires</a> to insert runtime checks for almost all undefined behavior when compiling in debug mode. So far all the easy cases are handled, which is already a dramatic improvement over c.</p>
<p>Zigs compile-time partial evaluation is done by an IR interpreter - it seems plausible that this could also be used as a miri-like tool in the future.</p>
<hr>
<p><code>@import</code> takes a path to a file and turns the whole file into a struct. So modules are just structs. And vice-versa - if you have a large struct declaration you can move it into a file to reduce the indentation.</p>
<p>Zig doesn't care at all where you put files on the filesystem.</p>
<p><code>@import</code> is part of the compile-time execution system so things like platform-specific modules and configurable features can be specified in regular code rather than rust's limited set of <code>#[cfg(...)]</code> macros.</p>
<hr>
<p>Array, struct, enum and union literals can be anonymous - <code>.{.Constant = 1.0}</code> is an anonymous union with it's own type, but can be implicitly cast to any union with a <code>Constant: f64</code> field because they share the same structure.</p>
<p>In rust my code is littered with <code>use Expr::*</code> and I'm careful to avoid name collisions between different enums that I might want to import in the same functions. In zig I just use anonymous literals everywhere and don't worry about it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Anonymous literals are also nice when using structs to simulate keyword arguments. No need to find and import the correct type:</p>
<pre><span>fn do_things(config: struct {
  max_things: usize = 1000, // default value
  flavor: Flavor,
}) void {
  ...
}

do_things(.{.flavor = .Strawberry});
</span></pre>
<hr>
<p>There is a pattern that shows up a lot in the materialize codebase:</p>
<pre><span>let</span><span> constant </span><span>= </span><span>if let </span><span>Expr</span><span>::</span><span>Constant(constant) </span><span>=</span><span> expr { constant } </span><span>else </span><span>{ </span><span>panic!</span><span>() }</span><span>;
</span></pre>
<p>It's common enough that many types have methods like <code>expr.unwrap_constant()</code>.</p>
<p>In zig:</p>
<pre><span>const constant = expr.Constant;
</span></pre>
<p>A similar pattern is:</p>
<pre><span>if</span><span> some_condition {
    </span><span>if let </span><span>Expr</span><span>::</span><span>Constant(</span><span>_</span><span>) </span><span>=</span><span> expr {
        </span><span>...
    </span><span>}
}
</span></pre>
<p>Again, many types get methods like <code>expr.is_constant()</code>.</p>
<pre><span>if</span><span> some_condition </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span> expr</span><span>.</span><span>is_constant</span><span>(…</span></pre></article></div>

Create shortcuts to show only the relevant information (screen by preferences).</h2><p>Spotify asks users to select their favorite artists instead of going to dashboard:</p><figure id="w-node-213b4e788a3d-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f8809c116cb645d12bb4594_spotify-onboarding.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>If you are a SaaS&nbsp;company that sells form building software, you could for example, ask what type of form the person is looking to create, then based on that selection provide an appropriate form template. This helps the user accomplish their task more quickly and they are more likely to stick with you after they've seen the value of your product.</p><h2>2. Take out unnecessary steps or save them for after the user has added value.</h2><p>SproutSocial does this well by instantly prompting to connect to social media accounts FIRST, and only then asking for additional information.</p><figure id="w-node-7da55c5c0f57-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f880ef541456e5a30b5034b_SproutSocial%20Additional%20Connections.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>First the user is asked to connect their social profiles (this instantly populates their dashboard with valuable insights)</figcaption></figure><figure id="w-node-ac84d3ff6921-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f880272ff20a95ceb04363c_sproutsocial.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Then the user is asked to answer some questions that will help SproutSocial segment their audience. Notice how there were no massive forms to fill out - this is key.</figcaption></figure><h2>3. Try checklists which encourage user to take small steps to engage with your product or add their own value.</h2><p>There are all sorts of ways to present this (header notice, widget, embedded, welcome email)</p><figure id="w-node-ef9c31814aa4-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f88028112b0af3c3a1e504b_checklist.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>4. Gamify with progression. Start them off with some steps already completed.</h2><p>If you are already using a checklist in your app's dashboard, you can start them off with some progress already made so that the user doesn't feel like they are starting from zero. </p><p>For example, you can cross off an item they've already completed (see above screenshot). </p><p>You could start them off at 20% instead of 0% when it comes to completing various steps to get to the "aha" moment of your product.</p><p>In multi-step onboarding you could visually indicate that the first step is already finished (presumably the 1st click to the form).</p><h2>5. Assist with templates - so user only has to modify contents.</h2><p><a href="http://pory.io/">Pory.io</a> is great at this. Instead of just dropping you off to let you figure out the tool on your own, they provide you with starting templates.</p><figure id="w-node-129cbdb09480-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f8802a8b78d93b942995c83_Pory.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>If templates do not apply, you could add placeholder content so people know how to edit and where to start. Templates are a great way to get people to skip all the busy work of starting from scratch and provide a semi-finished starting point. </p><p>Canva does an excellent job by allowing people to select an asset they wish to create, and present fully-designed examples that only require some tweaking.</p><h2>6. If integrating with other tools, show personalized how-to videos specific to the integration.</h2><p>Most SaaS&nbsp;companies add their integration instructions in support documents. If the user has to leave your dashboard and hunt down support docs, they could just as easily go do something else. </p><p>By providing relevant integration videos within the dashboard, you keep the user engaged and more likely to finish the setup.</p><p>Memberstack provides a handy Webflow integration tutorial for people who are building in Webflow.<br></p><figure id="w-node-b21132cc9f9c-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f8802dd24f28319c733480d_memberstack.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>7.

                <div><p>Ants are one of the most successful groups of animals on the planet, occupying anywhere from temperate soil to tropical rainforests, desert dunes and kitchen counters. They’re social insects and their team-working abilities have long since been identified as one of the key factors leading to their success. Ants are famously able to lift or drag objects many times their own weight and transport these objects back to their colony. But with previous research having focused on the social aspects of an ant colony, looking at an individual ant has been somewhat neglected. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, researchers at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) and Sorbonne University in Paris have investigated why individual worker ants are so strong by taking X-ray images and creating 3D models of their thorax – the central unit of their bodies – to analyze their muscles and internal skeleton. <a href="https://frontiersinzoology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12983-020-00375-9" target="_blank">Their study, published in<em> Frontiers in Zoology</em></a>, examines the hypothesis that loss of flight in worker ants is directly connected to the evolution of greater strength.</p>

<p>“Worker ants evolved from flying insects,” said Professor Evan Economo, who leads OIST’s <a href="https://groups.oist.jp/bbu" target="_blank">Biodiversity and Biocomplexity Unit</a>. “We’ve always assumed that losing flight helped to optimize their bodies for working on the ground, but we have much to learn about how this is achieved.”</p>

<p>Being able to fly might be a common dream amongst people but the reality of flight is that it puts strong constraints on the build of a body. In flying insects, the wing muscles occupy a major part of the thorax – sometimes more than 50%. This means that other muscles, which are used to support and move the head, legs, and abdomen are constrained and squeezed up against the exoskeleton.</p>

<p>But once the constraints of flight are removed, all that space in the thorax is open, which, the researchers surmised, would allow the remaining muscles to expand and reorganize.</p>

<p>Previous research in this area had focused on the external structure of ants but, with the technology available at OIST, the researchers were able to gain a highly detailed picture of what was going on inside the thorax. The aim was to analyze the general features common across all ants, rather than focus on the specialization of certain species. To do this, the researchers did a detailed analysis of two distantly related ant species, including both the wingless workers and the flying queens, and confirmed their findings across a broader sample of species.</p>

<p>They used advanced X-ray technology to scan the internal and external anatomy, like CT scans used in a hospital, but at much higher resolution. From these scans, the researchers mapped all the different muscles and modeled them in 3D. The result was a comprehensive image of the inside of the thorax. They then compared findings from these two species to a range of other ants and wingless insects.</p>

<p>As predicted, the researchers found that loss of flight had allowed for clear-cut reorganization of the thorax. “Within the worker ant’s thorax, everything is integrated beautifully in a tiny space,” said the late Dr. Christian Peeters, lead author of this paper, who was a research professor at Sorbonne University. “The three muscle groups have all expanded in volume, giving the worker ants more strength and power. There has also been a change in the geometry of the neck muscles, which support and move the head. And the internal attachment of muscles has been modified.”</p>

<p>Interestingly, when looking at wingless wasps, the researchers found that these insects had responded to the loss of flight in a completely different way. Wingless wasps are solitary and consume food as they find it. On the other hand, ants are part of a colony. They hunt or scavenge for food that then needs to be carried back to the nest for the queen and younger nestmates, so it makes sense that there was a selection pressure to promote carrying ability.</p>

<p>Ants have been studied for centuries in terms of their behavior, ecology, and genetics but, the researchers emphasized, this story of strength has, so far, been somewhat overlooked. The next step is to develop more detailed biomechanical models of how different muscle groups function, do similar research on the mandible and legs, and explore the diversity seen between ant species.</p>

<p>“We’re interested in what makes an ant an ant and understanding the key innovations behind their success” explained Professor Economo. “We know that one factor is the social structure, but this individual strength is another essential factor."</p>

<p>Alongside Professor Economo and Dr. Peeters, the research group included Dr. Roberto A. Keller from University of Lisbon and OIST, Mr. Adam Khalife from Sorbonne University and OIST, Dr. Georg Fischer and Mr. Julian Katzke from OIST, and Dr. Alexander Blanke from University of Cologne.</p>

<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/christianpeeters/home" target="_blank">Dr. Christian Peeters</a> passed away in early September 2020, just before this paper was published. In his scientific career, which spanned over thirty-five years and took him around the world, Dr. Peeters researched social insect societies with a focus on the evolution of ant reproductive behaviors, colony strategies, and morphological adaptations. In addition to publishing a long list of scientific papers, Dr. Peeters regularly created videos, gave talks, and contributed to online resources to make his research accessible to a non-scientific audience. OIST recognizes Dr. Peeters significant contributions to science, his passion for entomology, and the work he did in collaboration with the Biodiversity and Biocomplexity Unit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a id="intro" name="intro">INTRO</a></h2>

<p>The vast majority of people on earth argue in a <em>destructive </em>fashion. Debates, especially in online spaces, are viewed as a battle of the wits in which egos are put on display and there can be only one "winner".</p>

<p>Instead, we should be arguing in a <em>constructive </em>fashion: treating arguments as an opportunity to expand knowledge, finding points of disagreement, and collaborating towards a common truth.</p>

<p>I have a confession to make: I used to be a destructive arguer. When I was younger, my goal in any argument was not to learn something new, but rather to assure my superiority over what I felt to be the clear stupidity of the other side. I even used to save screenshots of debates I had on various forums and social media platforms, returning periodically to reminisce about past skirmishes in which I "<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/trigger-the-libs">owned the conservatives</a>".</p>

<p>Luckily, several years spent abroad gave me a different perspective. I realized that in the small-sided debates I used to engage in back home, my positions lacked the nuance and context of the greater world. For the first time, I began to do deep research on how to think — and argue — &nbsp;more clearly, drawing from concepts from philosophy, psychology, and behavioral economics.</p>

<p>This widened outlook led me to see arguments as a chance to build value, rather than destroy it. Instead of going through the mental anguish of battle, I now follow a collaborative approach to debate that I'd like to share in this guide in hopes that it will inspire others to argue more constructively.</p>

<p>Note that the content in this guide will focus on arguments about public issues, like politics and religion, as opposed to personal issues, like "you need to communicate more" or "you haven't done the dishes in weeks". Though there is overlap between the two, interpersonal arguments are much more complex and require more nuance than this guide can provide, plus there are already a ton of great resources out there that explore these topics more thoroughly.</p>

<h2><a id="mindset" name="mindset">MINDSET</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span><em>&nbsp;"An argument should be a collaboration between two people to find the truth."</em></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I had to distill this guide down to one sentence, it would be the above. Even if you forget the individual tenets and strategies this guide has to offer, as long as you are treating any given argument as a collaboration in search of truth, you can't go wrong.</p>

<p>Arguing more effectively requires detaching yourself from the idea of "winning" in the traditional sense. Instead, you should declare victory when you have argued in good faith and kept an open mind.</p>

<p>True collaboration requires that both parties open an investigation into why they may be wrong and consider changing their beliefs. Which brings us to the three core tenets of a constructive debate mindset:</p>

<h3>Acknowledge You May Be Wrong, and Be Willing to Change Your Mind <a href="#Acknowledge You May Be Wrong, and Be Willing to Change Your Mind" id="Acknowledge You May Be Wrong, and Be Willing to Change Your Mind" name="Acknowledge You May Be Wrong, and Be Willing to Change Your Mind"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></h3>

<p>Was there ever a time in which you had a deeply-held belief about something, but slowly came to realize that you were wrong? Maybe you thought a past partner was "the one", or you were devoted to a religious faith. Or perhaps something as simple as believing in Santa Claus.</p>

<p>What's to say that couldn't happen with the other deeply-held beliefs, given enough evidence?</p>

<p>Go into every debate with the mindset that you may not know everything about the topic at hand, and in fact <em>may be wrong</em>.</p>

<p>If you successfully acknowledge that you may be wrong, it follows that you must then be willing to change your mind. Having the humility to admit that your mind has been changed is one of the most honorable positions in a good faith debate.</p>

<h3>Arguments Are Not Soldiers <a href="#Arguments Are Not Soldiers" id="Arguments Are Not Soldiers" name="Arguments Are Not Soldiers"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></h3>

<p>In a war, all soldiers take an oath to fight for their own side, no matter what amount they agree with its principles. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f/politics-is-the-mind-killer">Eliezer Yudkowsky once observed</a> that in political debates, arguments were treated like soldiers: "<em>Once you know which side you're on, you must support all arguments of that side, and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side; otherwise it's like stabbing your soldiers in the back.</em>"</p>

<p>Because most people go into debate with a war-like mentality, they feel they must fly the flag for all points that <em>their</em><em> side</em> supports, regardless of how much they actually agree with them.</p>

<p>The red state gun-owner must be pro-religion, anti-abortion, anti-drugs, anti-tax, and skeptical of gender issues.</p>

<p>The blue state Subaru-owner must be anti-religion, pro-abortion, pro-drugs, pro-tax(ing-the-rich), and concerned about gender issues.</p>

<p>Most annoying is that given the societal expectations for this divide, being for or against one issue immediately assigns you to a "side" in the views of everyone involved. Breaking out of this Arguments as Soldiers mindset involves two steps:</p>

<p>1. Do not be afraid to agree with the arguments of the other side when they strike you as reasonable, and critique the arguments of your own side when they strike you as unreasonable (better yet, try not to have a side).</p>

<p>2. On the flip side, avoid stereotyping your debate partner based on one opinion. If you are engaging with someone in debate for the first time, assume that they agree with you on every other position than the one they are defending, until proven otherwise.</p>

<h3>There's Always Someone Who Thinks the Jedi Are Evil <a href="#There's Always Someone Who Thinks the Jedi Are Evil" id="There's Always Someone Who Thinks the Jedi Are Evil" name="There's Always Someone Who Thinks the Jedi Are Evil"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></h3>

<p><em>Brace yourself, Star Wars references incoming:</em></p>

<p>In a given debate, almost everyone thinks they are a member of the Jedi order, fighting for all that is virtuous and good in the universe. Yet for every Jedi, there's a Sith out there <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llLKar19XhA">who thinks that the Jedi are evil</a> and wrong and that <em>they</em> are actually the ones fighting for virtue and good. Remember that this person might even be <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, you are not a full agent of good, and your debate partner is not an agent of evil, or vice versa. You are simply citizens of the galaxy who happen to be operating with different sets of information. Look at the situation from a different perspective: if you were raised with Sith beliefs from childhood, don't you think you might believe the exact same things a Sith would?</p>

<p>In debate, your goal should not be to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMNKwZTv1d0">strike down the side of evil with all your hatred</a>, but rather work together with them to uncover the true facts about the universe, and in doing so perhaps change both your perspectives.</p>

<h2><a id="mindset" name="prework">PRE-WORK</a></h2>

<p>It would be great if choosing to pursue the path of arguing constructively was just a matter of changing your mindset overnight, but as Carl Sagan once said: <a href="https://youtu.be/BkHCO8f2TWs?t=9">"If you wish to bake an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe."</a></p>

<p>In the same vein, if you wish to improve the constructiveness of the debates you engage in, you must first spend time re-inventing your entire mind.</p>

<p>This is because our mind is constantly working against us, plagued by ancient errors from the times in which we lived in caves and hunted woolly mammoths. These errors work against us in the form of cognitive biases and logical fallacies, which hinder our ability to clearly see reality and engage in sound debate.</p>

<h3>Recognize and Avoid Cognitive Biases <a href="#Recognize and Avoid Cognitive Biases" id="Recognize and Avoid Cognitive Biases" name="Recognize and Avoid Cognitive Biases"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></h3>

<p>Cognitive biases are limits and mistakes in human judgement that prevent someone from acting rationally. They are present in every aspect of human life, and in tense situations like arguments, they tend to appear more often as emotions are heightened and the brain gets overloaded.</p>

<p>Common examples that relate to debates are <em>confirmation bias</em>, or the tendency of humans to seek out information that confirms existing beliefs, and <em>ingroup bias</em>, or the tendency to agree more strongly with people that appear to be part of our "tribe", but there are over 100 identified biases, and it's worth reading through the Wikipedia article on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">most common cognitive biases</a> so you can recognize when they might be clouding your thinking.</p>

<h3>Recognize and Avoid Logical Fallacies <a href="#Recognize and Avoid Logical Fallacies" id="Recognize and Avoid Logical Fallacies" name="Recognize and Avoid Logical Fallacies"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></h3>

<p>In part caused by cognitive biases, logical fallacies are errors in argument that give off an air of decisiveness, despite making points that don't hold up to logical scrutiny. While these are often used unintentionally, due to bias, carelessness, or ignorance, unfortunately, they can also be wielded intentionally by a shrewd debate partner.</p>

<p>Common examples in debate include the <em>false dilemma fallacy</em>: "you're either with us or against us", and the <em>slippery slope fallacy</em>: "if we allow the gays to marry, what's next: plants?" Just like cognitive biases, there are a large number of identified logical fallacies, and it's worth it to review the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies">entire list</a>, so you can spot them in your own arguments and in those of others.</p>

<h2><a id="debatebreakdown" name="debatebreakdown">BREAKING DOWN A DEBATE</a></h2>

<p>To the untrained eye, a debate might look like two or more parties trading argumentative points back and forth. But interestingly, these points can almost perfectly be classified into a few categories. Understanding these categories, and why some types of arguments are better than others, is crucial for learning how we and those whom we engage with in debate might shape their points. In a brilliant post called <em><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/08/varieties-of-argumentative-experience/">Varieties of Argumentative Experience</a></em>, Scott Alexander does just this, illuminating and labeling practically every part of a debate. The post itself is basically required reading, but is long-ish<em>,</em> so I will summarize here.</p>

<p>Think of a debate as a pyramid: <a href="#debatepyramid" id="debatepyramid" name="debatepyramid"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></p>

<p><img alt="" height="548" src="http://liamrosen.com/Pyramid%20of%20Argumentative%20Experience.svg" width="978"></p>

<p>In general, the lower on the pyramid you are, the worse debate you're having. The goal should be to start as high as possible and continue to work your way towards the top.</p>

<p>Debates on twitter and other forms of social media are almost guaranteed to never rise above the lower dotted line, as these platform don't allow for more nuanced debate. Everything above the higher dotted line is our gold standard: two intelligent, charitable, and versed debaters can successfully maintain a debate at this level until some form of resolution.</p>

And having people rushing through busy streets because they are late for a bus is also unsafe.&nbsp; Furthermore, for many people, missing buses can jeopardize their jobs or important health care appointments.&nbsp;</p><p>The authors said that said the bus apps could be more helpful by taking advantage of the data used in this study to make better recommendations.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><strong>Study:</strong> “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965856420307229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Does real-time transit information reduce waiting time?

    <li>You're all calculating churn rates wrong</li>
</ol>

        

        
        <p>
            Many smart people will tell you to obsess over your churn rate.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="https://catchjs.com/Blog//images/blog/churn/churn_rate_formula2.png" alt="churn rate=(customers lost in month)/(customers at start of month)">
        </p>
        <p>
            According to Andreessen Horowitz, this number is <a href="https://a16z.com/2015/08/21/16-metrics/">one of the top 16 metrics</a>
            to measure a SaaS startup by. Well, sorry Andreessen, and sorry Horowitz, but this just isn't right.
        </p><p>
            It's counterintuitive, but it's a statistical fact: This number actually <b>tells you nothing useful about churn</b>,
            but really relates to the age of the subscriptions you have.
            It will in most cases go down on it's own, and, absurdly, the only way to keep it from going down is to have very
            high growth. So the number will literally <b>only look <i>bad</i> if your business is doing extremely <i>well</i></b>,
            and optimizing for it will be directly counter-productive.
            The error here is a simple statistical mistake that is easy to make, and luckily also easy to understand and avoid.
        </p><p>
            If you run a subscription based SaaS business, you're likely very concerned with how long you can keep your
            customers. We're a JavaScript exception tracking service, and the health of this business is fully determined by how many
            customers we bring in, and how long we can keep them. On the surface, <i>churn rate</i> may seem like a natural proxy for changes
            in <i>customer lifetimes</i>. Let's dig into why that is not true.
        </p>
        <h2>
            The false assumption
        </h2>
        <p>
            Computing a churn rate <b>assumes that a customer is equally likely to leave at any time</b>, no matter how long they've
            been subscribed to you. This is almost certainly not true. In fact, as we will see, having a constant churn probability over time
            essentially implies that you'll <i>never have long term customers</i>.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="https://catchjs.com/Blog//images/blog/churn/expon.png" alt="Hazard function (churn) and the implied survival function (from an Exponential distribution)">
            <figcaption>If a user has a constant churn probability over time, this implies that customer lifetimes come from an Exponential distribution.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            If you have a constant churn of <code>c</code> per month, the probability that a customer stays subscribed for <code>n</code> months is <code>(1-c)^n</code>. This implies that customer lifetimes come from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution">Geometric distribution</a>. If customers can quit the subscription at any time, we have continuous time and should use the continuous time analogue, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution">Exponential distribution</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>
            What your churn is actually like, with help from K. S. Lomax
        </h2>
        <p>
            The problem is, your customer is not equally likely to cancel their subscription at any time. Most likely, you have a situation where the drop-off in customers is higher in the first few days than it is later. This is even more so if you have a free trial period for your product.
        </p><p>
            If the churn probability gets lower the longer the customer has been subscribed, you could model that as <code>c/(t+1)</code>, where
            <code>t</code> is the timestep (e.g. number of days the customer has been subscribed), and <code>c</code> is some constant.
            In this case, this implies that customer lifetimes comes from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lomax_distribution">Lomax distribution</a>.
            This is equivalent to a Pareto distribution shifted to start at 0.
        </p>

            <figcaption>The Lomax distribution can express churn probabilities that get lower with time.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h2>
            What your churn is actually like, with help from Waloddi Weibull
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you suspect that churn probability per day may <i>increase</i> the longer a user has been subscribed, the Lomax distribution won't
            work for you. Instead you could enlist the help of Swedish statistician Waloddi Weibull.
            The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weibull_distribution">Weibull distribution</a> can express both decreasing,
            flat, and increasing probabilities of a customer quitting. This makes it a popular choice for modeling customer lifetimes.
        </p>

            <figcaption>The Weibull distribution can express both growing and shrinking churn probabilities.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>
            Optimizing for a falsehood will lead you astray
        </h2>
        <p>
            Now let's see why properly modeling this is important.
        </p><p>
            Let's measure churn the wrong way, and see where it takes us.
            Let's say customer lifetimes come from a Lomax distribution. Let's also say you have a business that is in terrible shape, where
            the number of new sign ups per day is falling by one per day. How will this look on the churn rate? We can simulate it and find out.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keep in mind, in each of the examples below we simulate lifetimes from the same customer lifetime distribution,
            and this distribution <b>does not change</b> over time.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://catchjs.com/Blog//images/blog/churn/shrinking_business.png" alt="Shrinking business, churn appears to fall">
            <figcaption>With a shrinking business, churn appears to improve because subscriptions are getting fewer and older.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            This is clearly a dying business, yet the churn rate graph is looking great! <b>
                The churn rate per day is falling steadily,
                even if we know that there is no change in customer lifetimes in our model.
            </b>
        </p><p>
            So what's going on? This sharp fall in churn rate is a consequence of the fact that we're not getting new customers.
            Because we're not growing, a bigger share of our customers have been around for a long time, which
            means they're less likely to churn, which means our daily churn graph goes down more than it would otherwise.
            This change on the population level happens despite there being no change in underlying individual customer lifetimes.
        </p><p>
            Let's change this into a scenario where your business is experiencing insane growth. We'll keep the customer lifetimes exactly the same,
            but change it so that the number of new sign ups per day is growing superlinearly.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://catchjs.com/Blog//images/blog/churn/growing_business.png" alt="Growing business, churn appears to be flat">
            <figcaption>With a growing business, churn rate appears to not change, only because most subscriptions are new.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Even if the customer lifetimes are unchanged from before, the churn rate graph here is flat. An investor would frown and say
            we're doing nothing to improve how well we retain our customers. In reality, the only reason the graph looks "bad" has nothing to
            do with churn, it is because we're doing insanely well at getting new sign ups.
        </p><p>
            <b>
                If you are steering yourself and your team on the basis of this metric, you're rewarding yourself for stifling growth
                and punishing yourself for growing.
            </b> Obviously, this is 100% counterproductive.
        </p>
        <h2>
            How the h*** do we measure churn then?
        </h2>
        <p>
            As you might have guessed from the previous paragraphs, we should model the <i>distribution of customer lifetimes</i>,
            and we should do it in a <i>statistically sound way</i>. Lomax and Weibull distributions are good choices of model.
        </p><p>
            The part where this gets tricky is that we'll have two types of data: The customers that have quit, and the customers
            that are still subscribed. It's only our ex-customers that give us a total lifetime to work with. For our still-subscribed
            customers, we only know that their subscription has lasted up until now, and we don't know how much longer it will last
            into the future. In statistical lingo, we have what is called <i>right-censored data</i>.
        </p><p>
            Luckily there's a way to use all our data, even from our still-subscribed customers.
        </p>


        <h2>
            Weibull or Lomax?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Choosing between Weibull or Lomax (or any other distribution) has no simple answer. Weibull is more flexible
            in that it can express growing, shrinking and flat churn probabilities. However, this expressive power will
            not help you if your data is fundamentally Lomax-like. First and foremost, base your choice
            on your knowledge of the business that you're in. If you have any prior knowledge about how churn probabilities
            will develop, base your choice of distribution on that. There are also various
            <a href="https://www.weibull.com/hotwire/issue71/relbasics71.htm">goodness of fit</a> tests you could use to
            inform this decision. The truth is, any choice of distribution will be wrong to some degree, so you need to make
            a judgment call as to what fits your situation the best, based both on both your data and your prior knowledge.
            For the purposes of the rest of this post, we'll just fit both distributions and disregard the question of
            which suits us the best.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Let's do some proper statistics
        </h2>
        <p>
            The probability distributions we'll model are defined by their parameters.
            We want to find the parameters that fit the data best. To start, we want to make a guess at these parameters,
            and have a way to tell how good our guess was. Luckily, we have a statistically sound way of knowing how good a guess
            is given the data we have. Extra luckily, this is also true when we have censored data.
            This function that tells us how likely our parameters are given the data we have is called the Likelihood function.
            We get it by looking up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function">probability density function</a>
            value for the uncensored data points and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_function">survival function</a> value
            for each of the censored data points, and multiplying all these values together.
        </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span><p>“Computers are all made out of logic gates”. We’ve heard that saying before. We also have a sense that logic gates are very simple machines, analogous to light switches even. This raises the question: <em>how exactly do kind-of-light-switches come together to form computers</em>? How does “storing a variable” or “calling a function” translate into logic gates going on or off? </p><p>On a journey to answer that question, I discovered J Clark Scott’s excellent book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/But-How-Know-Principles-Computers-ebook/dp/B00F25LEVC" target="_blank">“How do It Know?</a>”. He starts with NAND gates and takes you on a journey to build a computer using them.</p><p>I liked his book so much that I took his schematic for RAM, and simulated it in Clojure. In this essay, I’ll guide you through doing just that: we’ll simulate NAND gates, and use about <em>14 thousand</em> of them to build 256 bytes of RAM.</p><p>Going through this simulation ingrained an “aha” feeling in me: watching 14 thousand little machines chug away makes you feel that whoever uses a computer is a wizard. A wizard with an army of millions of machine servants doing billions of little jobs for them every second. I hope it gives you the same feeling. 🙂</p><p>To grok this essay, you need to understand this picture:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk1Nzc2NDk4LTdhY2RkMzgwLTBjOTItMTFlYi04NWQ2LTZmOWEzNGE2NmU5Zi5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>This describes a NAND gate. A NAND gate is a machine that has two input wires. If both input wires have a “high” charge (represented as 1), the output charge is “low” (represented as zero). With any other combination of input charges, the output charge is high.</p><p>Notice that the wires carry a charge, but we choose to interpret <em>meaning</em> in the charge. “high charge” means 1, and “low charge” means 0. Nothing changes in the machine, this is just something we decided as humans (1).</p><p>On the left you see a circuit diagram. You can read it as input wires <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> carrying charges into the <code>NAND</code> gate. The <code>NAND</code> gate has a wire <code>c</code>, carrying the output charge. For all the circuit diagrams we’ll draw, you can read them as electricity “flowing” from left to right, or top to bottom.</p><p>On the right is a “truth” table for a NAND gate. This is just a fancy name for summarizing every state a <code>NAND</code> gate can be, based on the input wires.</p><p>Now, we can start even lower than a <code>NAND gate</code>, but this machine is simple enough. It can’t be so hard to build something that turns off when two inputs are turned on. You don’t have to take my word for it though, you can search up “building a NAND gate with transistors”, and come back when you’re convinced. </p><p>Time to code! 🙂</p><p>First things first, we need some way to represent the state of our circuit. We know that our RAM will be built completely from <code>NAND</code> gates, so let’s take inspiration from one:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk1Nzc2NTI0LTg0NTczYjgwLTBjOTItMTFlYi05NWMyLWJlMWQ4MzFlNTg5MC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>If we look at this example we can see that:</p><ol><li>We have wires. </li><li>Wires have charges.</li><li>We hook wires together with NAND Gates</li></ol><p>Here’s one way we can map that to a data structure in Clojure: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> ex-state-v0 {</span><span>:charge-map</span><span> {</span><span>:a</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>:b</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>:c</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>}</span>

We can also keep a map that tells us the charges of our wires. Finally, we can keep a list of NAND gates, which tell us how these wires connect. </p><p>Fine enough way to represent our circuit for now! Let’s create a few functions that can help us manage this representation:</p><pre><code><span>; update state v0</span>

Let’s try them out in the REPL:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>charges</span><span> (</span><span>-&gt;</span><span> empty-state</span>

<span>; =&gt; {:charge-map {}, :nand-gates [{:ins [:a :b], :out :c}]}</span></code></pre><p>Nice! We can now “wire” up a circuit. Let’s run some electricity through it.</p><p>To figure out how to simulate electricity into our circuit, let’s remember our diagram again:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk1Nzc2NTU3LTk0NmYxYjAwLTBjOTItMTFlYi05NGZkLTNlM2JkMzI5OWYwNC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>One way we can model this is to imagine that electricity is like water: It “flows” from sources into wires, and “triggers” all the devices that are connected to those wires.</p><p>With a model like that, here’s what would happen if a charge was “triggered” on <code>a</code>:</p><ol><li>First, <code>a</code>‘s charge would update. </li><li>After that <code>a</code> ‘s charge would transfer to all the NAND gates that are connected to it. In this case, it would be our one NAND gate above.</li><li>Each NAND gate would then recompute its charge, and if it changed, trigger its output wire in turn. In our case that’s <code>c</code> </li><li>If <code>c</code> was connected to other <code>NAND</code> gates, those gates would trigger, and the process would continue.</li></ol><p>Now, this is a very naive view of how electricity works (2), but it’s good enough for us to model RAM!</p><p>Let’s translate this into code.</p><p>To do that, we need a way to model what a <code>NAND</code> gate does:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> nand-output [a b]</span>

<span>; =&gt; 0</span></code></pre><p>Our <code>nand-output</code> function takes two input charges, and produces the output charge that a <code>NAND</code> gate would produce.</p><p>Next, we need a function to find all the <code>NAND</code> gates that are connected to a specific wire:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> dependent-nand-gates [state wire]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>filter</span><span> </span>

<span>; =&gt; ({:ins [:a :b], :out :c})</span></code></pre><p>This searches all of our <code>NAND</code> gates in our circuit, and finds the ones which are connected to a specific wire.</p><p>With that, we have what we need to implement <code>trigger</code>:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>declare</span><span> trigger-nand-gate)</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>If programmers were just more disciplined, more <em>professional</em>, they’d write better software. All they need is a <a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Martin-Clean-Coder-The-A-Code-of-Conduct-for-Professional-Programmers/PGM8366.html">code of conduct</a> telling them how to work like those of us who’ve worked it out.</p>
<p>The above statement is true, which is a good thing for those of us interested in improving the state of software and in helping our fellow professionals to improve their craft. However, it’s also very difficult and inefficient to apply, in addition to being entirely unnecessary. In the common parlance of our industry, “discipline doesn’t scale”.</p>
<p>Consider the trajectory of object lifecycle management in the Objective-C programming language, particularly the NeXT dialect. Between 1989 and 1995, the dominant way to deal with the lifecycle of objects was to use the <tt>+new</tt> and <tt>-free</tt> methods, which work much like <tt>malloc/free</tt> in C or <tt>new/delete</tt> in C++. Of course it’s <em>possible</em> to design a complex object graph using this ownership model, it just needs discipline, that’s all. Learn the heuristics that the experts use, and the techniques to ensure correctness, and get it correct.</p>
<p>But you know what’s better? Not having to get that right. So around 1994 people introduced new tools to do it an easier way: reference counting. With NeXTSTEP Mach Kit’s <tt>NXReference</tt> protocol and OpenStep’s <tt>NSObject</tt>, developers no longer need to know when <em>everybody</em> in an app is done with an object to destroy it. They can indicate when a reference is taken and when it’s relinquished, and the object itself will see when it’s no longer used and free itself. Learn the heuristics and techniques around auto releasing and unretained references, and get it correct.</p>
<p>But you know what’s better? Not having to get that right. So a couple of other tools were introduced, so close together that they were probably developed in parallel[*]: Objective-C 2.0 garbage collection (2006) and Automatic Reference Counting (2008). ARC “won” in popular adoption so let’s focus there: developers no longer need to know exactly when to retain, release, or autorelease objects. Instead of describing the edges of the relationships, they describe the <em>meanings</em> of the relationships and the compiler will automatically take care of ownership tracking. Learn the heuristics and techniques around weak references and the “weak self” dance, and get it correct.</p>
<p>[*] I’m ignoring here the significantly earlier integration of the Boehm conservative GC with Objective-C, because so did everybody else. That in itself is an important part of the technology adoption story.</p>
<p>But you know what’s better? You get the idea. You see similar things happen in other contexts: for example C++’s move from <tt>new/delete</tt> to smart pointers follows a similar trajectory over a similar time. The reliance on an entire programming community getting some difficult rules right, when faced with the alternative of using different technology <em>on the same computer</em> that follows the rules for you, is a tough sell.</p>
<p>It seems so simple: computers exist to automate repetitive information-processing tasks. Requiring programmers who have access to computers to recall and follow repetitive information processes is wasteful, when the computer can do that. So give those tasks to the computers.</p>
<p>And yet, for some people the problem with software isn’t a lack of automation but a lack of discipline. Software would be better if only people knew the rules, honoured them, and slowed themselves down so that instead of cutting corners they just chose to ignore important business milestones instead. Back in my day, everybody knew “no Markdown around town” and “don’t code in an IDE after Labour Day”, but now the kids do whatever they want. The motivations seem different, and I’d like to sort them out.</p>
<p>Let’s start with hazing. A lot of the software industry suffers from “I had to go through this, you should too”. Look at software engineering interviews, for example. I’m not sure whether anybody actually believes “I had to deal with carefully ensuring NUL-termination to avoid buffer overrun errors so you should too”, but I do occasionally still hear people telling less-experienced developers that they should learn C to learn more about how their computer works. <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3212479">Your computer is not a fast PDP-11</a>, all you will learn is how the C virtual machine works.</p>
<p>Just as Real Men Don’t Eat Quiche, so <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/articles/927/real-programmers-don-t-use-pascal">real programmers don’t use Pascal</a>. Real Programmers use FORTRAN. This motivation for sorting discipline from rabble is based on the idea that if it isn’t at least as hard as it was when <em>I</em> did this, it isn’t hard enough. And that means that the goalposts are movable, based on the orator’s experience.</p>
<p>This is often related to the <em>term</em> of their experience: you don’t need TypeScript to write good React Native code, just Javascript and some discipline. You don’t need React Native to write good front-end code, just JQuery and some discipline. You don’t need JQuery…</p>
<p>But along with the term of experience goes the breadth. You see, the person who learned reference counting in 1995 and thinks that you can only <em>really</em> understand programming if you manually type out your own reference-changing events, presumably didn’t go on to use garbage collection in Java in 1996. The person who thinks you can only <em>really</em> write correct software if every case is accompanied by a unit test presumably didn’t learn Eiffel. The person who thinks that you can only <em>really</em> design systems if you use the Haskell type system may not have tried OCaml. And so on.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that for this variety of disciplinarian, the appropriate character and quantity of discipline is whatever they had to deal with at some specific point in their career. Probably a high point: after they’d got over the tricky bits and got productive, and after you kids came along and ruined everything.</p>
<p>Sometimes the reason for suggesting the disciplined approach is entomological in nature, as in the case of the eusocial insect the “performant” which, while not a real word, exists in greater quantities in older software than in newer software, apparently. The performant is capable of making software faster, or use less memory, or more concurrent, or less dependent on I/O: the specific characteristics of the performant depend heavily on context.</p>
<p>The performant is often not talked about in the same sentences as its usual companion species, the irrelevant. Yes, there may be opportunities to shave a few percent off the runtime of that algorithm by switching from the automatic tool to the manual, disciplined approach, but does that matter (yet, or at all)? There are software-construction domains where specific performance characteristics are desirable, indeed that’s true across a lot of software. But it’s typical to focus performance-enhancing techniques on the bits where they enhance performance that needs enhancing, not to adopt them across the whole system on the basis that it was better when everyone worked this way. You might save a few hundred cycles writing native software instead of using a VM for that UI method, but if it’s going to run after a network request completes over EDGE then trigger a 1/3s animation, nobody will notice the improvement.</p>
<p>Anyway, whatever the source, the problem with calls for discipline is that there’s no strong motivation to <em>become</em> more disciplined. I can use these tools, and my customer is this much satisfied, and my employer pays me this much. Or I can learn from you how I’m <em>supposed</em> to be doing it, which will slow me down, for…your satisfaction? So you know I’m doing it the way it’s supposed to be done? Or so that I can tell everyone else that they’re doing it wrong, too? Sounds like a great deal.</p>
<p>Therefore discipline doesn’t scale. Whenever you ask some people to slow down and think harder about what they’re doing, some fraction of them will. Some will wonder whether there’s some other way to get what you’re peddling, and may find it. Some more will not pay any attention. The dangerous ones are the ones who thought they <em>were</em> paying attention and yet still end up not doing the disciplined thing you asked for: they either torpedo your whole idea or turn it into not doing the thing (see OOP, Agile, Functional Programming). And still more people, by far the vast majority, just weren’t listening at all, and you’ll never reach them.</p>
<p>Let’s flip this around. Let’s look at where we <em>need</em> to be disciplined, and ask if there are gaps in the tool support for software engineers. Some people want us to always write a failing test and make it pass before adding any code (or want us to write a passing test and revert our changes if it accidentally fails): does that mean our tools should not let us write code for which there’s no test? Does the same apply for acceptance tests? Some want us to refactor mercilessly; does that mean our design tools should always propose more parsimonious alternatives for passing the same tests? Some say we should get into the discipline of writing code that always reveals its intent: should the tools make a crack at interpreting the intention of the code-as-prose?</p>

			    	<p>Have you ever experienced your laptop fan becoming loud simply by viewing a web page? The most likely culprit are the ads on the page.</p>

<p>Magic Lasso Adblock blocks ads, privacy trackers and unnecessary JavaScript on web pages. By removing these items, pages are smaller and battery life sees a big improvement.</p>

<p>Having efficient, light and simple pages reduces a web browser’s energy use, including its’ use of the CPU and graphics processor. When there’s less to load, render and interpret, a web browser is faster and also uses less battery. Let’s take a closer look at how much an impact this can make.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#what-impacts">What impacts battery life?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#how-many">How many unnecessary ads exist on common pages?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#how-can-improve">How can I improve my battery life?</a></li>
  <li><a name="what-impacts"></a><a href="#what-else">What else can I do to improve web browsing battery life?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#try-magic-lasso">Give Magic Lasso Adblock a try to improve your battery life</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-impacts-battery-life">What impacts battery life?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ads are the most frequent user of battery life.</strong> Ads use a lot of network resources to load and also significantly use the CPU to display complex animations or video. Many web pages include multiple ads which reduces battery life further.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although not as impactful as ads, <strong>tracking scripts also impact battery life.</strong> Many of these scripts are bloated; adding extra page weight and extra loading time. For no benefit to the user. Tracking scripts can also slow pages by recording usage as you interact.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many web apps now use <strong>complex JavaScript frameworks</strong> that may impact battery life. Although necessary for an app to function, due to their use of non-native code they are not always efficient users of the CPU. Both web pages and some apps such as Microsoft Teams and Slack use JavaScript heavily, which quickly drains your device’s battery.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent years, <strong>hidden crypto-mining scripts</strong> have been included on approximately 0.2% of all web pages. The majority of pages execute crypto-mining without user consent. <a name="how-many"></a>These scripts are especially heavy users of the CPU, slow down browsing and unnecessarily use battery life and energy.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="how-many-unnecessary-ads-exist-on-common-pages">How many unnecessary ads exist on common pages?</h3>
<p>Advertisements and tracking scripts, like any other website element, adds page weight and loading time to web pages. Even once a page has loaded, many scripts are running constantly, increasing the ongoing energy use while you read page content.</p>

<p>On a popular website such as The Verge, these unnecessary elements add 4.96 MB of page weight to each and every page load.<a name="how-can-improve"></a></p>

<p><strong>That’s 62% of the total page weight spent on features that don’t assist you as a reader.</strong></p>

<h3 id="how-can-i-improve-my-battery-life">How can I improve my battery life?</h3>
<p>The easiest way to remove all of these unnecessary elements is to use an ad blocker. By default, Magic Lasso Adblock removes all advertisements and tracking scripts. In addition, the Battery Boost feature blocks many heavy JavaScript frameworks and stops hidden background crypto-mining scripts.</p>

<p>To see how much of a difference this makes, we did some tests. You’ll see the results below.</p>

<p>Using a selection of random pages from the top News and Media websites in the US (as reported by SimilarWeb), we automated loading, viewing and scrolling of the page to replicate a normal user.</p>

<p>Then we recorded the time until 10% battery life remained, both with Magic Lasso enabled and disabled.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.magiclasso.co/insights/adblock-that-doubles-battery-life/browser-battery-life@2x.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Magic Lasso Adblock with Battery Boost reduced energy consumption by over 50%.</strong> <a name="what-else"></a>That gives you twice as much battery life to use your device on each charge when doing heavy web browsing.</p>

<h3 id="what-else-can-i-do-to-improve-web-browsing-battery-life">What else can I do to improve web browsing battery life?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>In Safari on the Mac, <strong>disable auto-playing videos</strong>. This reduces battery use while browsing on many sites that play videos automatically. Available in Preferences &gt; Websites &gt; Auto-Play. If you want to view the video you can just tap to play instead.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Reader mode by default</strong> to make many news sites a more pleasant and lightweight experience. Safari includes a useful Reader mode which shows an article’s content and removes any distracting surrounding navigation and ads. It doesn’t work for all sites but is helpful for websites with articles that your read often. Enable this on the Mac in Safari Preferences &gt; Websites &gt; Reader. In Safari on iOS, it can be set in the Address bar &gt; Aa &gt; Website Settings.</li>
  <li>When battery life is getting low on your iPhone or iPad, <strong>enable Low Battery mode.</strong> Available in the Control Centre and also in Settings &gt; Battery &gt; Low Power Mode, this temporarily reduces any background activity which extends your battery until you can charge it.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Wifi.</strong> When Safari accesses data on an iPhone or iPad, a Wi-Fi connection uses less power than a mobile network. So keep Wi-Fi on at all times. To turn on, go to Settings &gt; Wi-Fi.</li>
  <li>Finally, <strong>adjust your screen brightness.</strong> A bright screen uses a surprising amount of the overall battery of your device. <a name="try-magic-lasso"></a>Therefore you can dim the screen or turn on Auto-Brightness to extend battery life.</li>

          <p><em>A short tutorial on how to design a menu navigation toggle with only CSS</em></p>
        
        <p>When thinking through navigation designs for mobile devices sometimes the best option is to store away the content behind a toggle button. This button would then display the menu items upon interaction. Let me show you how to create such an element with only CSS - no need for JavaScript today!</p>

<h2 id="before-we-begin">Before we begin</h2>

<p>I would like to point out that the concept of “toggling” the main menu (even for mobile) is not always the best solution. If you’re interested, you can take a look at a previous article I wrote explaining why: <a href="https://uglyduck.ca/hamburger-menu-alternative/">Using Hamburger Menus? Try Sausage Links</a></p>

<p>Now that we have mentioned possible pitfalls of relying so heavily on toggle menus, let’s build one!</p>

<h2 id="our-final-product">Our Final Product</h2>

  on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>


<h2 id="the-html">The HTML</h2>

<p>To implement this design you really don’t need much in terms of HTML:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A single <code>checkbox</code> input</li>
  <li>A <code>label</code> that corresponds to the <code>checkbox</code></li>
  <li>A <code>nav</code> element to house our unordered list items</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;!-- The checkbox input &amp; label partner --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;input</span> <span>type=</span><span>"checkbox"</span> <span>id=</span><span>"menu-toggle"</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;label</span> <span>for=</span><span>"menu-toggle"</span><span>&gt;</span>Menu<span>&lt;/label&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;!-- The navigation we wish to toggle --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;nav&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;ul&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span>href=</span><span>""</span><span>&gt;</span>Home<span>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span>href=</span><span>""</span><span>&gt;</span>About<span>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span>href=</span><span>""</span><span>&gt;</span>Articles<span>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span>href=</span><span>""</span><span>&gt;</span>Colophon<span>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span>href=</span><span>""</span><span>&gt;</span>Contact<span>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/nav&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That’s it!</p>

<h2 id="the-css">The CSS</h2>

<p>The first thing we need to do is “hide” the <code>checkbox</code> input element. It’s important to avoid using <code>display: none</code> or <code>visibility: hidden</code> in order to achieve this. Those CSS properties can negatively impact accessibility (specifically screen readers). So we will be relying on the <code>position</code>, <code>z-index</code> and <code>opacity</code> properties to help us out.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>/* Set the input position to absolute, send it off screen with zero opacity */</span>
<span>input</span><span>[</span><span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"checkbox"</span><span>]</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>-9999px</span><span>;</span>
    <span>opacity</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>position</span><span>:</span> <span>absolute</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then we give our corresponding <code>label</code> a minor face-lift to make it appear more button-like:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>/* Minor visual styling to make the label more button-y */</span>
<span>label</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>border</span><span>:</span> <span>1px</span> <span>solid</span> <span>currentColor</span><span>;</span>
    <span>border-radius</span><span>:</span> <span>4px</span><span>;</span>
    <span>cursor</span><span>:</span> <span>pointer</span><span>;</span>
    <span>padding</span><span>:</span> <span>10px</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>For our main <code>nav</code> element, we want to set it’s position to <code>absolute</code> in order to avoid any janky page rendering issues that might occur when toggling the menu:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>/* Set nav to absolute (avoids odd page rendering space pop-in) */</span>
<span>nav</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>opacity</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>position</span><span>:</span> <span>absolute</span><span>;</span>
    <span>z-index</span><span>:</span> <span>-2</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The last step is to actually <em>show</em> the menu if the user toggles the <code>checkbox</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>/* Show nav when checkbox is checked */</span>
<span>input</span><span>[</span><span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"checkbox"</span><span>]</span><span>:checked</span> <span>~</span> <span>nav</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>opacity</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>z-index</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It might not look like much, but you now have a fully functional menu toggle - <strong>made with pure CSS</strong>!</p>

<h2 id="with-great-power">With Great Power…</h2>

<p>Although this design is very simple to implement, please remember to use these types of menus wisely. Just because you <em>can</em> do something, doesn’t always mean you <em>should</em>.</p>

From the jet fuel and gasoline burned to transport the packages, to the cardboard boxes cluttering your house, the whole process is filled with reminders that your actions have tangible, permanent consequences.
Download that book onto an e-reader, however, and this trail of evidence seems to vanish.
The reality is, just as a package purchased on Amazon must be transported through warehouses and shipping centers to get to your home, a downloaded book must be transported from data centers and networks across the world to arrive on your screen.</p><div><div><div><div><div><svg width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 278 44" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"

    E-Book <span idyll="[object Object]"><b> →</b></span></p><p>It is difficult to ignore the environmental consequences of ordering a physical book on Amazon. But what happens when you download an E-Book instead?</p></div></div></div></div></div><p>And that’s the thing: your digital actions are only possible because of the physical infrastructure built to support them.
Digital actions are physical ones. This means that Google has to be mindful of sharks.
This also means that we should be mindful of the carbon emissions produced by running the world’s data centers and internet networks.
According to one study, <span>the Information and Communications Technology sector is expected to account for 3–3.6% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2020</span> <a title="Assessing ICT global emissions footprint: Trends to 2040 &amp; recommendations, Lotfi Belkhir and Ahmed Elmelgi" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095965261733233X">[<!-- -->1<!-- -->]</a>.
That’s more than the fuel emissions for all air travel in 2019, which clocked in at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/19/climate/air-travel-emissions.html" target="_blank">2.5%.</a>
The answer to “why?” and  “how?” may not be immediately obvious, but that’s not the fault of consumers.
A well-designed, frictionless digital experience means that users don’t <i>need</i> to worry about what happens behind the scenes and, by extension, the consequences.
This is problematic: the idea of “hidden costs” runs contrary to principles of environmental awareness.
Understanding how these digital products and services work is a crucial first step towards addressing their environmental impact.</p><p><span><span><div><hr><div><p>Get updates from the Parametric Press</p></div><hr></div></span></span></p><p>

When you listen to audio on your device, you generally load a version of the original audio file that has been compressed into a smaller size.

This means that in the one minute timespan that both audio files were played, roughly twice as much data needed to be loaded for “Old Town Road” than for “Digging into ‘American Dirt’”, which leads to the song having about twice as large of a carbon footprint.

In the chart, the number in front of the “p” for quality refers to the height, in pixels, of the video.

From the chart, it is clear that the “Old Town Road” music video has a higher bitrate than the 3Blue1Brown animation at both qualities. 
This difference could be attributed to a variety of factors, such as the frame rate, compression algorithm, and the producers’ desired video fidelity.</p><p>In the examples provided, videos produced far more CO₂ than audio over the same time span.

Things are out of joint in the delta of the Mekong, Southeast Asia’s largest river. Rising sea levels and subsiding land are threatening to flood the area.</p><br><div><p>
Simultaneously, the annual Monsoon inundations are delayed more and more often, while still retreating early, and leaving local fields parched.</p><p>But why? Let’s unravel a complex tangle of reasons, with climate change at its core.</p></div><p>
Deltas have always been hubs of human development. Ancient civilizations flourished in the Nile and the Ganges deltas. Today, <a text="half a billion people" url="https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=138738&amp;org=NSF&amp;from=news" href="https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=138738&amp;org=NSF&amp;from=news">half a billion people</a> call deltas home—even though they cover only 1% of the earth’s land surface. With rich crops and abundant fish, deltas are crucial to food security and economic development.</p><p>However, deltas are also extremely vulnerable.</p><p>Located at the intersection of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, a delta’s entire existence depends on a delicate balance of factors: Temperature. Freshwater and saltwater. Precipitation and river flow.</p><p>In the Mekong delta, this balance has been disturbed. As a consequence, the delta of Southeast Asia’s largest river is both sinking and drying out at the same time. While ever-rising waves lap away at the coastline, and higher sea levels push salty water into the delta, severe droughts are leaving the landscape parched.</p><p>But what exactly causes this double threat? And what can be done about it?</p><p>The answers to these questions are as complex as the environmental and political problems casting their shadows over the region.</p><p>At the heart of the issue: Climate change.</p><h2 id="living-with-the-river">Living with the River</h2><p>Springing from the vast Tibetan plateau at the foot of the Himalayas, the Mekong river winds its way over 2,700 miles through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.</p></div><div><p>The Mekong River and its Delta</p><p>From the Tibetan plateau through six countries: China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam</p><p><img src="https://parametric.press/issue-02/sinking-delta/static/images/overview.png" idyll="[object Object]"></p><div><div><p>SOURCE</p><p>Christina Orieschnig</p></div><p>Parametric Press</p></div></div><div><p>The abundant fertility of the Mekong delta is based on the annual Monsoon cycle.</p><p>Fed by torrential rains, the Mekong begins to swell in June, overbrimming its banks and inundating the surrounding floodplains.

The other, wide expanses of open water.</p></div><div><p>Far from being a disaster, these inundations are welcomed by the local inhabitants.</p><p>During the wet season, the delta is replenished. Fish populations explode. Water infiltrates the soil, dusty from months of little to no precipitation, and is stored in canals and lowland areas.</p><p>The sediments left behind at the end of the wet season are full of nutrients.

In Vietnam, the annual average temperature rise has been <a text="0.1 °C per decade since 1900" url="https://www.ipcc.ch/apps/njlite/ar5wg2/njlite_download2.php?id=9112" href="https://www.ipcc.ch/apps/njlite/ar5wg2/njlite_download2.php?id=9112">0.1 °C per decade since 1900</a>, ramping up to 0.14 °C per decade towards the end of the century. Summer temperature increases are even higher, with average monthly temperatures climbing by 0.1–0.3 °C per decade.</p><p>But higher temperatures are not the only contributor to the droughts that have struck the region in recent years.</p></div><p>Meteorological experts trace the immediate cause for this back to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Approximately occurring every four years, El Niño is a global weather event with impacts on local weather. It is caused by a change in temperature distributions in the Pacific Ocean. Oceanic and atmospheric conditions interact to invert the usual east-west direction of ocean surface winds. Now blowing from west to east, they drive warm equatorial waters towards the eastern Pacific. This, in turn, has impacts on weather patterns such as the Monsoon rains over Southeast Asia.</p><div><p>Yearly rainfall in the Mekong basin since 1981</p><p>In El Niño years, there is generally less cumulative rainfall in the river basin.

In Southeast Asia, 2015/16 saw a drought similarly severe as that of 2019.

<p><span>As technological advances continue to build out the digital economy it is perhaps ironic that physical locations still seem to matter so much. Slack and Twitter and Zoom and a host of various collaboration software products have facilitated our ability to communicate with people from all around the world. And yet, up-and-coming founders will still pay 3x the national average in rent so that they can live in Silicon Valley or Manhattan. Despite our ever-improving virtual tools, the triumph of the city is not reversing anytime soon. And the countries with the most vibrant tech clusters will get to decide the pace and the direction of the future. We need both a better understanding of how tech clusters form and how we can maximize their benefits.</span></p>
<h3><b>Why and how do tech clusters form?&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><span>Economists and urbanists talk a lot about the significance of clustered networks of individuals and firms working and living together in a shared environment. All else equal, having more smart people interacting leads to more ideas which leads to more innovation which leads to more growth. The whole ecosystem of product designers, scientists, engineers, supply chain managers, investors, and academics ends up creating more than the sum of their parts. These </span><a href="https://www.agglomerations.tech/"><span>agglomeration effects</span></a><span> occur in cities across the world, but the US has had a unique geopolitical advantage in having the premier industrial clusters for essential technologies like software development and machine learning.</span></p>
<p><span>Defined </span><a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.34.3.50"><span>formally</span></a><span>, we could say that an industrial or tech cluster is a geographic region with a disproportionate share of economic activity, high-skilled technical employment, granted patents, and R&amp;D funding when compared to their share of the national population. Less formally, we could say that tech clusters are in the cities where the most interesting conversations and cutting-edge applications in a particular field are happening.</span></p>

<p><span>San Francisco is the archetypal example, but Boston, Seattle, Austin, and Denver all meet this threshold as well. Larger cities like New York and Los Angeles are more ambiguous, as their share compared to population size is not disproportionate, but narrowing the analysis to a subregion like Manhattan or Santa Monica would likely turn up a traditional tech cluster.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Historically, clusters have been pivotal in driving long-term US growth and for creating innovations that improve the lives of billions of people around the globe. As economists </span><a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.34.3.50"><span>William Kerr and Frederic Robert-Nicoud</span></a><span> summarize, there has been a continual movement of leading tech clusters over time in the US. In the 1800s, Lowell, Massachusetts was the center for textile mills relying on water power. By the early 1900s, Cleveland, Ohio was instrumental in pushing forward the frontier on electricity and steel. Detroit, Michigan, of course, developed into the powerhouse for automobile manufacturing in the mid-1900s.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Currently, US tech clusters are the envy of the world. There are only four </span><a href="https://howmuch.net/articles/companies-trillion-dollar-club"><span>trillion dollar companies</span></a><span> in the world. Two of them are based near San Francisco (Apple and Alphabet), and two near Seattle (Amazon and Microsoft). Of the </span><a href="https://www.bondcap.com/report/itr19/#view/12"><span>global top 30</span></a><span> Internet firms, 14 are based in SF alone.</span></p>
<p><span>The effects that these clusters have on innovation and productivity growth are quite impressive, even on the individual level. Enrico Moretti </span><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w26270"><span>models their impact</span></a><span>: “a computer scientist moving from the median cluster in computer science (Gainesville, FL) to the cluster at the 75th percentile of size (Richmond, VA) would experience a 12.0% increase in productivity, holding constant the inventor and the firm. In biology and chemistry, a move from the median cluster—Boise, ID—to the 75th percentile cluster—State College, PA—is associated with a productivity gain of 8.4%, holding constant the inventor and the firm.” And as the clusters get larger and more specialized, the productivity boosts also get larger.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While the benefits and significance of tech clusters are fairly well established, what is less well known is precisely how tech clusters originate and why they end up in the specific places they do. That software clustered near San Francisco was not inevitable, that auto manufacturing clustered in Detroit was not fate, that semiconductor fabrication today clusters in Taiwan is not preordained. So how do clusters arise?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the past, clusters would frequently populate around a specific natural resource that was necessary for the operation of the tech in question, i.e. natural harbors, coal and iron deposits, fast-flowing streams. But the ultimate resources for technology development today are the human minds that can come up with and then implement new ideas. So tech clusters today are mostly about attracting and organizing talented humans in cities they would actually want to live in.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>More formally, to become a tech cluster today, a location needs:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>An anchor organization as a first-mover in getting high-skilled talent in a particular field to come to a region (usually a firm or a university)&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>An urban environment in which firms and workers in adjacent sectors can benefit from large knowledge spillovers as new advances and technical approaches diffuse across the region quickly</span></li>
<li><span>The development of high-velocity labor markets where workers with deep technical expertise can quickly start, join, or leave various firms</span></li>
<li><span>A social scene that is animated by a particular industry or technology area such that the conversations happening in local bars are some of the best in the world for that subfield</span></li>
<li><span>A sufficient supply of industry-specific resources (venture capitalists, relevant scientific or manufacturing infrastructure, government contracts)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>A good bit of luck</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>It’s worth emphasizing that the development of a cluster is a process rather than a flip that is switched at a specific moment in time. A location may not have all of these elements right at the very beginning but will need to quickly develop them if it wants to have staying power beyond an initial flash in the pan. Also complicating things, some of these factors suffer from a chicken-or-the-egg problem as it is much easier to attract specialized capital and interested young people to a region once the cluster already exists.</span></p>
<p><span>The historical accidents of particular government policies can sometimes serve as a tiebreaker among competing destinations. One reason that Silicon Valley may have become the primary driver for software development rather than the Boston area is California’s decision to </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/new-money/2017/2/13/14580874/google-self-driving-noncompetes"><span>not enforce non-compete agreements</span></a><span>. While not necessarily the intention, this accelerated both the degree of knowledge spillovers and the velocity of labor markets in the region. Today, top developers at large tech companies frequently leave to start competitors and help cutting-edge practices and the more promising technical approaches diffuse quickly throughout the region. This may be frustrating for the particular firms losing out, but it makes the larger tech cluster more vibrant and dynamic. And by increasing the number of approaches attempted to solve an issue, it increases the odds of a breakthrough innovation happening.</span></p>
<p><span>But tech clusters don’t necessarily last forever. As an industry matures and becomes more established it tends to be less reliant on the kind of rapid experimentation and ideation that is facilitated so well by tech clusters. As that happens, an industry may disperse over a larger set of regions, or be subsumed into a more traditional urban agglomeration.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unsurprisingly, it seems to be the case that the development of a new </span><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w11093"><span>general-purpose technology</span></a><span> is usually a prime candidate for allowing new tech clusters to form. But interestingly, there may be a bias towards slightly smaller cities that can operate as more a blank slate for the fledgling industry than can a large, established city.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Looking at the emergence of auto manufacturing as an example, despite having fewer initial entrants and a smaller population, activity started to concentrate in smaller cities like St. Louis, Cleveland, Indianapolis, and in the ultimate winner, Detroit. According to </span><a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.34.3.50"><span>Kerr and Robert-Nicoud</span></a><span>, this smaller city advantage may have been due to the higher physical proximity of engineers, production line managers, and funders as it was easier to share prototypes, run experiments, and circulate ideas between the relevant stakeholders. These smaller regional hubs may have been able to provide more attention and financial resources to these new firms because there was simply less competition.</span></p>
<p><span>This should not be all too surprising when we consider the softer, cultural aspects that make up an attractive tech cluster. It seems likely that the culture of a city made up disproportionately of geneticists and CRISPR scientists might differ from that of petroleum engineers and fracking specialists. Having a separate city is useful for establishing a different culture and offers a type of specialization that can attract a separate set of weird, ambitious young people that will form the backbone of a cluster.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The conversations in the bars and social scenes of San Francisco feel </span><i><span>very different</span></i><span> from those in the financial district of NYC because the types of people attracted to those cities are very different. To truly become a cluster for a particular field, a city essentially has to reach some critical density of conversations in the social scene to be …</span></p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://parametric.press/issue-02/algae/static/images/algae-cover.jpg"></p><p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has published six assessment reports on future climate scenarios with recommended methods of reducing carbon in the atmosphere. The most common of these reports focus on methods by which we can reduce the rate of global warming by 1.5–2°C per year. Scientists use these levels as a benchmark: scientists estimate that 1.5–2°C of warming <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/were-almost-out-of-time-the-alarming-ipcc-climate-report-and-what-to-do-next/">over the next 10 years</a> will cause irreversible changes to Earth’s climate. In 2017, we breached the 1°C warming mark.</p><p>The IPCC has outlined four potential pathways for how the world can avoid these dramatic changes to our environment. According to their research, if we want a chance of staying below 1.5°C, it won’t be by simply reducing emissions—we also need to be actively removing CO₂ from the atmosphere. All of the IPCC’s pathways that would lead to a world below 1.5 degrees of warming <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-qa-ipccs-special-report-on-climate-change-at-one-point-five-c">require</a> <strong>both reducing and removing CO₂</strong>.</p><div><p>A dire scenario</p><p>The IPCC uses four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to to demonstrate the effects of action or inaction on CO₂ levels in the atmosphere. Climate scientists currently think that RCP 8.5 (sometimes called the 'business-as-usual' pathway) is the most likely scenario.</p><p><label>Entire projection</label><label>Where we are now</label></p><div><div><p>SOURCE</p><p>IPCC | The Atlantic</p></div><p>Parametric Press</p></div></div><p>The IPCC recommendations roughly fall under two categories: reduction and removal of CO₂. Methods of reduction you’ve likely heard of—solar panels, windmills, plant-based diets. At a global scale, these changes would reduce the amount of energy we use and limit our reliance on fossil fuels.</p><p><span><span><div><hr><div><p>Get updates from the Parametric Press</p></div><hr></div></span></span></p><p>On the other side are methods of removal—things that actively suck carbon dioxide out of our atmosphere. Carbon removal includes things like planting more trees and other plants that naturally absorb CO₂. A carbon removal plan might also include newer technologies that use something called bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (usually called BECCS, but more on that later).</p><p>This is a story about how we could get there; a story about trees and algae and giant human-sized bioreactors; and ultimately, a story about how maybe our solutions, no matter how innovative, should really be reflecting the natural world around us.</p><h2 id="the-hope-of-a-trillion-trees">The hope of a trillion trees</h2><p>At Davos earlier this year, the World Economic Forum announced a <a text="plan to plant one trillion trees" url="https://www.1t.org/" href="https://www.1t.org/">plan to plant one trillion trees</a> over the next decade. The campaign received widespread approval and enthusiasm from attendees, and even received backing from President Trump through a <a text="recent executive order" url="https://www.axios.com/trump-one-trillion-trees-climate-change-forestry-1f4c32b7-9514-410b-a4dc-b2c6ecee72e0.html" href="https://www.axios.com/trump-one-trillion-trees-climate-change-forestry-1f4c32b7-9514-410b-a4dc-b2c6ecee72e0.html">recent executive order</a> to promote tree planting. (This may seem surprising coming from the man who notoriously <a text="withdrew" url="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/climate/trump-paris-agreement-climate.html" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/climate/trump-paris-agreement-climate.html">withdrew</a> the US from the Paris Agreement on global climate action.)</p><p>But as we’ll see, the possibility of even planting a trillion trees may be more of a political pipedream than an achievable reality.</p><p>A plan for more trees in the world does give us some reason to celebrate. According to a <a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/what-we-do/our-insights/perspectives/natures-make-or-break-potential-for-climate-change/">study</a> comparing natural climate solutions, the top two methods for cost-effectiveness and carbon reduction are 1) planting more trees (reforestation) and 2) keeping the trees we have now from being destroyed (avoided forest conversion).</p><p>The “trillion” target for number of new trees planted is also supported by research: <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6448/76">The global tree restoration potential</a>, a study published last year in <em>Science</em>, claimed that planting 1.2 trillion tree saplings on 1.7 billion hectares could remove “two-thirds of all the emissions from human activities that remain in the atmosphere today.” For scale, this would be the equivalent of reforesting an area of land the size of the United States plus Canada combined.</p></div><div><p>Trees, and plants in general, are very good at the <em>removing CO₂ part</em> of our fight against irreversible climate change. Many people categorize this as a viable carbon sequestration method. But there’s a problem with planting a trillion trees: we first need the amount of land to do it. We also need to keep them alive long enough to help us.</p><h2 id="a-trillion-trees-fall-short">A trillion trees fall short</h2><p>Shortly after releasing the study claiming that 1.7 billion hectares of new forests could drastically reduce emissions, the authors of the study received <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6463/eaay8060/tab-pdf"> a series of sharp rebuttals</a> from the scientific community. Critics claim that the study drastically overestimated the amount of carbon sequestered by trees; alternative models suggest it’s closer to half of what was projected.</p><p>But model estimates aside, the trillion tree plan has a few other significant drawbacks, most important being time and scale. Let’s look at time first.</p><p><span><span>
  Bigger, older trees <a href="https://www.pacificforest.org/ee-old-trees-store-more-carbon-more-quickly-than-younger-trees/">have been shown</a> to be more effective than young trees at reducing CO₂ in the atmosphere. The key is in the leaves: the more time a tree has to generate leaves, the more photosynthesis can happen!</span></span></p><p>Travel booking app Hopper <a href="https://media.hopper.com/news/introducing-hopper-trees">announced</a> earlier this year that for every flight booked through their app, they will donate money to plant four trees. Their back-of-the-envelope math estimates that one tree will sequester around a metric ton of carbon dioxide, which would offset a return trip from a single passenger in the air on a cross country flight. But there’s a problem: Trees don’t spring into the earth fully grown, sucking their max amount of carbon out of the atmosphere.</p><p>Best case estimates show that it will take <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615102/tree-planting-is-a-great-idea-that-could-become-a-dangerous-climate-distraction/">around 25 years</a> before the amount of carbon sequestered matches the amount of carbon emissions for a single person’s share on a single flight (some trees can take up to 100 years to mature fully). So while the strategy may be effective, it won’t help us much in the ~10 years estimated by the IPCC that we have left to prevent irreversible changes to the climate. In fact, a team of scientists at NASA <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2927/examining-the-viability-of-planting-trees-to-help-mitigate-climate-change/">estimate</a> that reforesting 1.7 billion hectares of new trees could take between one and two thousand years.</p></div><div><p>The second obstacle for tree planting is scale. Researchers claim that the available land we have across the world to plant more trees equals about the size of the entire United States (the study from <em>Nature</em> would require land the size of the US <em>plus</em> Canada). But this planting goal also assumes the best case scenario in which humans 1) willingly convert existing land to forests and 2) protect forests with a renewed vigor.</p><p>To take a specific example, let’s look at a single country. The United Kingdom has pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050. A <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/ccc-one-fifth-of-uk-farmland-must-be-used-to-tackle-climate-change">report</a> this year found that in order to reach that goal, the UK would need to commit 20% of its current farmland to dedicated carbon capture and storage uses. And to have a chance at reaching their targets, they need to start doing that, more or less, right now.</p><p>Converting farmland is not an isolated effort either: Reducing traditional crops by around 20% means the government will also count on people to adopt low-carbon farming practices, reduce food waste, and make diet changes described as “a 20% shift away from beef, lamb and dairy to alternative protein sources.”</p><p>If you apply this concept across the world, the amount of farmland we need to convert is daunting. According to the IPCC report, over 70% of Earth’s ice-free land is being used or shaped by human activity. Around 25–30% of this usable land is going straight to producing food, raising cattle, growing cotton for clothes, and energy production.</p><p>On top of all this, if somehow we did find the 1.7bn hectares of suitable land to plant these trees, we would also need to protect them. When trees die, they release all the CO₂ they have eaten up back to the atmosphere. Deforestation in the Amazon rainforest <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-deforestation/brazil-amazon-deforestation-soars-to-11-year-high-in-2019-idUSKBN1XS1PK">rose by nearly 30% in 2019</a>. On the other side of the globe, bushfires in Australia emitted<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/13/australias-bushfires-have-emitted-250m-tonnes-of-co2-almost-half-of-countrys-annual-emissions"> nearly half</a> of the country’s annual emissions—and that’s on top of Australia’s usual CO₂ output.</p><h3 id="can-you-remove-all-the-co₂-with-trees?">Can you remove all the CO₂ with trees?</h3><p>To fully understand the complications around relying on trees to save the planet, it’s useful to look at how this actually plays out with a simulation. The interactive version is embedded below, but first a few pointers:</p><div><div><p><img src="https://parametric.press/issue-02/algae/static/images/sim-preview-2.png"></p></div></div><p>Each <span idyll="[object Object]">■</span> red dot represents a unit of CO₂. Some studies estimate that a single tree can remove up to 48 lbs CO₂ per year. When a tree sequesters CO₂, it stores this unit as a <span idyll="[object Object]">■</span> blue dot. But sadly, sometimes trees are felled, burned, or just die naturally...</p><div><div><p><img src="https://parametric.press/issue-02/algae/static/images/sim-preview-3.png"></p></div></div><p>When a tree does die, it releases all the CO₂ it removed back into the atmosphere. The simulation keeps track of these “deforestation” events, so when an old tree dies, it releases all the dots it once removed from the air. It also tracks how many years we have left to make meaningful changes (as noted earlier, it’s somewhere between 10–30 years depending on who you ask).</p><p>Plant a forest to see how many trees it would take to remove all the CO₂ bubbles. But be careful: When you lose a tree, you also lose the CO₂!</p></div><div><p>As the simulation illustrates, trees are a vital tool to fighting climate change. But when left unprotected, they can end up recycling the same CO₂ over and over again, never having the time to permanently store it away. Previously <span idyll="[object Object]">■</span> sequestered CO₂ returns to <span idyll="[object Object]">■</span> historic CO₂. Trees will capture, release, capture, release—and without deforestation prevention, the cycle goes on.</p><p>Planting trees is unquestionably a good idea, but it’s likely not the “silver bullet” solution to fighting climate change. It is simply not enough on its own. We also need to be pursuing new technologies and methods of capturing carbon from the atmosphere, like direct carbon capture from the air. And maybe, we might find inspiration for tackling one of humanity’s biggest technical challenges in one of Earth’s smallest life forms: algae.</p><h2 id="how-algae-removes-co₂-from-the-atmosphere">How algae removes CO₂ from the atmosphere</h2><p>You’ve probably seen algae before—it’s floating about on ponds and washing up on shores as kelp seaweed. It takes many different forms, though. Algae can be as small as 0.2mm in picoplankton and as large as 60m long in the form of giant sea kelp. And incredibly, when you take all the types of algae together, this family of flora produces about half of all oxygen on the planet.</p></div><div><p>In recent years, there has been a …</p></div></div>

  <p>To recognise a chair or a dog, our brain separates objects into their individual properties and then puts them back together. Until recently, it has remained unclear what these properties are.

          The human brain breaks down the environment into a total of 49 properties, which are sufficient to categorise all objects. Depending on how similar the observed object is to a known category, it is then recognised as a dog or, for instance, a piece of furniture.

<p>We live in a world full of things that we have to identify and classify into different categories. Only when you are able to identify the things around you, you can communicate with others about them and act in a meaningful way. If we see something in front of us that we recognise as a chair, we can sit on it. Once we have identified an object as a cup, we can lift it up and drink from it.</p>
<p>In order to carry out this mapping and make sense of our environment, we have to constantly compare the input to our senses with the information we have already learned. To do this, the brain breaks down an object into its individual properties, compares them with those that are already known, and puts these properties back together. Depending on how similar the observed object is to a known category, it is then recognised as a piece of furniture or a vessel. So far, however, it has remained unclear how we consider things to be similar or less similar. In other words, what are the characteristics that make us recognise objects?</p>
<p>Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, in collaboration with the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, USA, have now identified a set of 49 properties that allow us to determine almost all objects, i.e. the properties underlying their so-called mental representation. This representation reflects the format into which the brain translates a stimulus. In the case of an object, it is composed of, for example, colour, shape and size, but perhaps also of the fact that it "is natural", "can move", "is valuable" or "is animal-related". The researchers had been looking for the set of dimensions that were interpretable and minimally sufficient, i.e. that contained as few properties as possible and yet were enough to describe everything.</p>

<p>"Our results show that it actually takes surprisingly few dimensions to characterise all objects in our environment," says Martin Hebart, first author of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-00951-3" target="_blank">article describing these results</a>. The human brain breaks down the environment into a total of 49 properties, which are sufficient to categorise all objects. "From these dimensions we can also infer what is perceived as particularly similar or what is perceived as particularly typical for a category," the neuroscientist continues. Whether, for example, a mussel or a dog is perceived as a more typical animal. "Fundamentally, this explains the basic principles of our thinking about objects."</p>
<p>However, the results could also be used for medical purposes. Until now, it was believed that patients who cannot identify certain animals because of brain damage would not be able to recognise animals as a whole. But it is possible that the patient has a deficit in recognising the characteristic "fluffy" that is a property of many animals. This may then lead to other forms of therapy.</p>
<p>The scientists investigated these relationships with the help of almost 2,000 pictures of objects representative of most things encountered in our environment.&nbsp; They then showed study participants three of the pictures at a time, for example, koala, dog and fish, but also koala, doormat and pretzel. From each of these, the participants were asked to choose the “odd one out”, the one that they perceived to be most different from the other two. In the case of koala, doormat, and pretzel, for some this might have been the koala, because, unlike the other two, it is a living creature or is considered "not flat". For others, it might have been the pretzel, because doormats and koalas are fluffy or you can only eat the pretzel. Yet for others, it might be the doormat, because it is made of inorganic material. This means that the answers are not always clear, but they highlight the relevant properties to find out all the core dimensions of objects.</p>
<p>The researchers tested almost 1.5 million combinations of three objects with the help of nearly 5,500 participants. From this, they developed a computational model which they used to calculate which object was most likely to be chosen to be the odd one out. The more often two objects are left in, the more similar they are. It turned out that their model enabled the scientists to predict the similarity of two objects very precisely. But it also provided the 49 core dimensions that enable us to categorise our world according to simple criteria.</p>

<p>Today we are thrilled to announce the Turing Pi V2. We’ve been collecting a massive amount of information, synthesizing all of it in product variations, and thinking about what steps we should do next. Today we are going to announce only some of the fundamental details about the V2. We are still working on checking some of the hypotheses, but believe me, the other parts of the announcement will be exciting too. We will disclose more closer to opening orders. </p>



<p>After we released the original 7 nodes Turing Pi, we had many questions. What to do next, how to increase the product’s value, what compute modules to choose, how many nodes, etc. We decided to determine the minimal cluster block size with options to connect hard drives and extension boards. The cluster block should be a self-sustained base node and with ample scope of scale. Next, we wanted the minimum cluster blocks to have an option to connect and form cluster federations and, at the same time, be cost-efficient and easy to scale. The speed of scale should be higher than connecting regular computers on the network and cheaper than the typical server hardware. Another thing, the minimum cluster units should be compact enough, mobile, energy-efficient, cost-effective, and easy to maintain. This is one of the key differences between server racks and everything related to them.</p>



<h3>Number of nodes</h3>



<p>To determine the minimal cluster unit, we started by picking the optimal number of nodes. By simple logical judgments, we realized that a 4 nodes cluster is the best option. One node is not a cluster. Two nodes, not enough – 1 master and 1 worker doesn’t give too many options to scale within the block, especially for heterogeneous options. Three nodes look better but still limited to scale the block. We decided to choose 4 nodes option. More than 4 nodes would be either more expensive for PoC or challenging to fit into the mini ITX form factor.</p>



<p>We believe 4 nodes is a golden median because:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>The more affordable production cost of the cluster board and allows getting a more affordable fully equipped cluster as a result</li><li>A more solid architecture with 1 main node and 3 workers</li><li>More heterogeneous variations with general-compute + accelerated-compute</li></ul>

<p>While searching the compute modules, we opened a whole market—various modules with 128 MB RAM to 8 GB RAM. We are expecting to see 16 Gb RAM options soon too. For hosting cloud-native apps on the edge, 1 GB of RAM is already not enough, and the recent appearance of modules with 2, 4, and even 8 GB of RAM provides good space for growth. We also considered options with FPGA modules for machine learning but decided to hold on to this because the software ecosystem is still not mature enough. While studying the compute modules market, we came up with ​​creating a unified compute module interface that we are implementing in the Turing Pi 2. This will allow connecting compute modules from other manufacturers and also combine different purpose modules to solve specific tasks.</p>



<p>Today we are announcing V2 support for the Raspberry Pi 4 Compute Module (CM4), including Lite and 8 GB RAM versions.</p>

<h3>Peripherals</h3>



<p>After determining the compute modules vendor and the number of nodes, we started to study the PCI bus option. The PCI bus is a standard for peripheral devices, and it is found in almost all compute modules. We have several nodes and ideally so that each node can share PCI devices in concurrent request mode. For example, if a hard drive is connected to the bus, it is available to all nodes. We started looking for PCI switches with multi-host support and found that none of them fit our requirements. These solutions were mostly limited to 1 host or multi-hosts, but no concurrent endpoints request mode. The second problem is the high cost of $50 or more per chip. In the Turing Pi 2, we decided to postpone experiments with PCI switches and return to this later as we mature. So far, we decided to assign a role for each node along the path: the first two nodes are exposed to mini PCI express port, the third node is exposed to 2-ports 6 Gbps SATA controller. You can use the network file system within the cluster to access hard drives from other nodes. Why not?</p>



<h3>Sketches &amp; result</h3>



<p>We decided to share some sketches of how the minimal cluster unit evolved over time through discussions and observations.</p>

<p>As a result, we came to a cluster unit with 4x 260-pin nodes, 2x mini PCIe (Gen 2) ports, 2x SATA (Gen 3) ports. The cluster board has a Layer-2 Managed Switch with VLAN support. You can use the mini PCIe port connected to the first node to install a network card and get another Ethernet port or connect a 5G modem and make the first node perform as a router.</p>

<p>The cluster management bus has more functions now, including the ability to flash modules directly through all slots and of course, FAN connectors with speed control on each node.</p>



<h3>Use cases</h3>



<h4>Edge infrastructure for self-hosted applications &amp; services</h4>



<p>We designed the Turing Pi 2 as a minimal building block for consumer / commercial-grade edge infrastructure. With V2, it’s affordable to start a proof-of-concept and scale as you grow, gradually migrating applications that are more cost-effective and practical to host on the edge. Cluster blocks can be linked together and form larger clusters. This can be done sequentially without interrupting already established processes. There are already a huge number of business applications to<a href="https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> host apps locally</a>.</p>



<h4>ARM Workstation</h4>



<p>With up to 32 GB of RAM per cluster unit, the first node can be used to run the desktop version of the OS, for example Ubuntu Desktop 20.04 LTS. The remaining 3 nodes can be used for compilation, testing, debugging tasks, and development of cloud-native solutions for ARM clusters.</p>



<p>The Turing V2 cluster is architecturally similar to the AWS Graviton clusters. The CM4 processor uses the ARMv8 architecture. You can build images and applications for AWS instances of Graviton 1 and 2, which are known to be much cheaper than x86 instances. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Turing V2 can easily be included in the existing clusters (cloud or on-premises) and shared with other participants using Kubernetes RBAC.</p>



<h3>Wrapout</h3>



<p>The Turing Pi 2 is more functional than V1 and we also expect it to be cheaper to manufacture. </p>



<p>We are very grateful to everyone who supported us and baked the Turing Pi project by purchasing the Turing Pi V1. The Turing Pi 2 wouldn’t be possible without your support. As a way to thank our supporters, we will offer 25% off for the Turing Pi 2 for everyone who purchased the V1.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s it for now. We hope you are excited about the upcoming V2 which we plan to release next year. We will post more updates on the progress along the way. Stay tuned.</p>

What determines how successful you are is how quickly you're able to react to what happens in the world.”</em></p><p>Sean Harper is the CEO and co-founder of Kin Insurance, a Chicago-based home insurance start-up focused on using technology to offer homeowners the lowest rates as quickly as possible. He does so in an industry known for moving slowly. “We believe in creating meaningful change for homeowners who need our solution the most,” Harper says of Kin. Prior to founding Kin in 2016, Harper founded Fee Fighters, later sold to Groupon, and TSS-Radio, an e-commerce company. Prior to Kin, both Harper and co-founder Lucas Ward consulted for top financial companies, including several for PNC.&nbsp;</p><p>Kin offers home insurance in Florida and California, both states known for their catastrophe exposure. Kin recently closed a $35 million Series B funding round led by Commerce Ventures, which brings its total funding to date to $90 million.&nbsp;</p><p>In this interview:</p><ul><li>How Harper moved from consulting to start-ups to founding Kin</li><li>The 3 criteria Harper wanted in creating a start-up</li><li>How Kin innovates compared to legacy insurance companies</li><li>Kin’s entry into catastrophe insurance coverage</li><li>Why Kin is better at underwriting insurance than legacy companies</li><li>The future of insurance online and the value of real customer service</li><li>Kin’s culture, early experiments and what Kin is focusing on next&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>I would love to hear about your background and how you came about founding Kin.</strong></p><p>My co-founder Lucas and I have been doing online financial services for a long time. We just sort of fell into the start-up thing and realized we liked it a lot. The great thing about consulting gigs is you get to see a lot of stuff that big companies aren't doing very well. We really enjoy doing start-ups because you can start with a blank sheet of paper and do it the right way. If you're a software geek, which we both are, you look around for problems that are easy for you to solve. Financial services are easy to solve because it's all online. There's no physical product to worry about. And we're good at online stuff. And really I think if you look at the core of a bank or an insurance company or stock trading company, they're actually software companies, but they're not very good at software. We’re a few companies in now. We’re good at it now, building financial companies from scratch.</p><p><strong>Were you in or around the insurance area at all?</strong></p><p>Almost all the consulting I did was in financial services and the same for Lucas. We worked at, between the two of us, probably three of the five top P&amp;C financial companies. Basically, Lucas and I had come out of selling our companies and we were kicking around for two and a half years trying to come up with our big idea. In the meantime, we were doing interim gigs for private equity backed companies. We didn't want to sell technology to big financial institutions because their adoption cycles are so slow. We wanted to go direct to the consumer and beyond that, we were looking for three criteria.&nbsp;</p><p>First, I wanted to be in a large and homogenous market. Second, I wanted it to be a market where it was very inefficient. I didn't want to have to win on underwriting at the onset, because it's really hard to win on underwriting until you have data. Now we have a bunch of data. And we have a huge underwriting advantage over our competitors, but on day one, I didn't want to have to do that because it's a good way to get blown up. The third thing I wanted was for there to be new data sources available for pricing and underwriting.&nbsp;</p><p>We didn't just look at insurance. We looked at all financial services. We found catastrophe-exposed homeowners insurance. It fits all those criteria. It's a $40 billion market and growing fast to extraordinarily inefficient expense ratios. The amount of money that's wasted is about 40% of every dollar they collect. And there's just a ton of data out there – the weather that's around the home, geography, the neighborhood, the construction.&nbsp;</p><p>Most insurance companies are underwriting on the same 20 to 40 fields of data that's all self reported or agent reported. They're basically doing it the same way they've been doing it for 100 years. The business model has changed and the main way it's changed since we've climbed our way up the stack is we started as a digital broker, similar to a company like Zebra or Gabi, and then we became an MGA, which is sort of a virtual insurance company. And then last year, we actually formed our own insurance entity. We did that because it's really hard to raise enough money to start an insurance company on day one. We had to build our way to it. We learned a lot at each stage that made us know we were ready to go to the next stage.</p><p><strong>You operate on this specific segment of the home insurance market: catastrophe-prone homes.</strong></p><p>In the United States, there's about 100 billion dollars of premium spent every year on homeowners insurance. It's growing 3% to 4% a year, and of that 100 billion, 40 billion of it is catastrophe exposed. It's a huge niche and it is clear that the weather is getting worse. Let’s hope we can reverse that, but it's not going to happen overnight. We're going to need to deal with it by having good insurance that allows us to spread the risk out, ready to deal with it by investing and hardening our homes to make them more weather resilient. So, we find our work meaningful because we're working on insurance for people who need it. And I think it's only a matter of time. Here in Chicago, we're pretty sheltered from extreme weather, but it is affecting more and more places. And so even more of the market will end up being catastrophe exposed next year and year after year.</p><p><strong>Why are you guys better at underwriting your home insurance than someone else?</strong></p><p>We are much more efficient at administering and servicing. We talked about the cost structure before. About 60% goes to pay claims and about 40% goes to other stuff. For us, that 40% is more like 8%, so we're just very efficient. We don't pay brokers. Brokers occupy about 17% of that 40%. We're very efficient at marketing and we have a very good tech system. Your average insurance company spends about 5% of premiums for their IT on an ongoing basis. Yet, their biggest problem is their tech doesn't work. We’re also really good now at understanding the physical properties of the home and the micro environment around it. We know the difference in risk between being the second house off the water and the fourth house off the water in California. Are you right next to the brush land or is there a road between you and the brush land? Because it makes a huge difference. And we're able to ingest all this data and understand on a micro basis which homes are more or less risky. Then we're able to price it properly.</p><p><strong>What’s stopping a legacy insurer from utilizing the same types of data that you do?</strong></p><p>In theory, nothing. In fact, four years ago, the way we came up with this idea was by going around and talking to a lot of people from the industry and finding all the smart things that they wish they could do but couldn't. At the core, every insurance company actually is a software company. We have a really cutting edge policy administration system, our core processing system. It's leaps and bounds better than what any of our competitors have. It does exactly what we need it to do and it's really easy to change. So if we want to launch a new product or add a new data source, these are the kinds of things that might take us hours and take our competitors years. What determines how successful you are is how quickly you're able to react to what happens in the world. Our competitors are not able to react quickly.</p><p><strong>You said that you're able to issue new products at a faster rate. What are some examples?</strong></p><p>We saw an opportunity to do insurance for manufactured homes, a very underserved market, in Florida, which is also underserved because of its catastrophe exposure. We actually launched that product in less than a month, including regulatory approval, and that&nbsp;doesn't happen in insurance.</p><p><strong>A surprising amount of insurance is still being sold through physical agents, not online. How do you view that? Is the wind ultimately blowing in your direction for insurance being purchased online?</strong></p><p>I just turned 40 so I'm sort of borderline millennial and I was sure I was building this for people my age and younger. Amazingly – we realized this three months after we launched and it's still true – our average customer is in their mid 50s. It shouldn't be that surprising. The average age of a homeowner is late 40s, and in Florida, it's higher. But then you start talking to these people and the thing is, they all bank online. Their retirement accounts are all online; they all have the Capital One or Amex credit card. Even they think it's weird to buy insurance at a store.&nbsp;</p><p>We do a lot of customer support on the phone and via email with a real human. Being techie does not mean that you need to be inhuman. If you think about our name, it's Kin. That's family. I don't send automated messages to my children. I talk to them in person. That's how families act with each other. So it doesn't need to be impersonal just because it's tech-based. That's a really big part of who we are. We like having this human element. A home is somebody's biggest asset for the most part. It's nice to be able to ask a person a question like, “Hey, I saw this on the website. Can you explain that to me?” So that actually is a huge role in our customer experience.</p><p><strong>How’s business been in the past five or six months, given that most of the current climate has changed?</strong></p><p>There's been no impact on consumer demand. Probably the biggest impact for us has been operationally. We've been operating remotely. We're located in Tampa and Chicago and we like our office. We like hanging out with each other. We like going for drinks after work. We like playing ping pong. We like working on the …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>It has been a big year for realizing the limits of technology for interacting with people. Gamers have known this for a long time. Lag, disconnections, and coordination issues were problems in gaming since the start. There is a platform that has gone a long way in solving those problems: Discord.</p>



<p>Discord allows people to talk and chat online. Servers are created by anybody to talk about anything, usually, it is a friend group or a shared interest. They contain chat channels (kind of like Slack) and voice channels that are always on and allow people to join and leave whenever they want.</p>



<p>The competition between internet communication platforms is fierce. Discord wasn’t early to voice channels or group chats. They weren’t unique for targeting their offering to gamers. Other platforms have the same features as them. Yet they are a multi-billion dollar business. How? To borrow an idea from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://medium.com/@sarahtavel/how-to-build-an-enduring-multi-billion-dollar-business-hint-create-a-10x-product-recast-3527df2b8fcb" target="_blank">Sarah Tavel</a>, they built a 10x better product AND capture more value from it.</p>



<h2>10x Better</h2>



<p>Voice chat sucked for a long time. Skype, which was long the most popular option, was a mess. It forced you to call people. Servers went down often. The application crashed. Chats were all over the place. There is a good reason people do not use Skype and it is because it sucks.</p>



<p>There were other competitors like IRC, TeamSpeak, Mumble, Ventrilo. All had basically the same features, voice calls, and chat. Each suffered from a combination of problems like:</p>



<ul><li>Complicated setup process. Any new member must also go through a setup process.</li><li>Paid hosting. No one wanted to pay when there were free options. Especially true as servers grow.</li><li>Unclear benefits. Convincing one person was not enough, you needed to convince your whole group of the benefits of switching.</li><li>Weird ideological reasons. Your platform was your tribal affiliation, switching means abandoning your tribe. Everyone looked down on people who didn’t use the same platform as them (even if it was jokingly).</li></ul>



<p>Discord launched in May 2015, long after the competitors listed above. They are now more successful than those same competitors. They did so by making the experience 10x better:</p>



<ul><li>Discord requires nearly no setup. Starting a server on Discord takes two clicks. Creating channels is two clicks. It works instantly and all the time.</li><li>Discord is free.</li><li>It is easy to switch to Discord. Inviting people is two clicks and a paste. Joining a server (once you have an account) is two clicks. It is so simple you don’t even think about it.</li><li>Non-core features like emoji support, reactions, bots, integrations, video calls, and screen-sharing all work as well as you could ask.</li><li>Big community servers for games, fanbases, organizations, hobbies, and more.</li></ul>



<p>Improvements in each of these areas add up to a 10x better experience than other platforms. I complain about Discord way less than I complain about Skype. There are benefits for everyone on Discord, which makes it a 10x experience both for groups and individuals.</p>



<p>On top of being 10x better, the core features are free. This causes an obvious business problem, how do you make money? There isn’t an obvious place to put ads. Competitors often charge by the member, but that incentivizes against growth. Discord figured out a way to incentivize growth while capturing value from large and small groups. </p>



<h2>Sell Status to Capture Value</h2>



<p>It took Discord a long time to figure out monetization (and they still are figuring it out). Venture capital allowed them to experiment with ideas such as selling games and membership. Neither worked perfectly, but they pointed in the right direction. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2020/06/30/discord-was-once-the-alt-rights-favorite-chat-app-now-its-gone-mainstream-and-scored-a-new-35-billion-valuation/#article-0-topx-1:~:text=Discord%20is%20on%20track%20to%20top,Discord%20groups%20that%20they%20belong%20to." target="_blank">Forbes estimated</a> they are “on track to top $120 million in sales this year (2020)… up from around $70 million last year.”</p>



<p>To understand Discord’s monetization, look at their history. The founders previously started game companies and were <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord_(software)#cite_ref-vb_2015_funding_9-0:~:text=%5D%20Their%20first%20product%20was%20Fates,and%20based%20on%20more%20modern%20technology.%5B" target="_blank">inspired by free-to-play games like League of Legends.</a> Games like League of Legends sell status. It is free-to-play but you can buy “skins” to make your character look different. If you have a cool or expensive skin, it means you care more about the game. It raises your status. Discord does the same.</p>



<p>Discord allows users to raise their status through a subscription called Nitro. It provides quality improvements (file size and video quality), special profile upgrades (more emojis, animated profile photos, custom tags), and most importantly, the ability to “boost” a server.</p>



<p>Boosts raise a user’s status in both small and large servers. They allow you to either improve your friend’s online hangout and your communities’ experience by unlocking custom emotes, cosmetic features, and quality improvements. For users, it puts an icon next to their name saying they contribute and gives them a special booster role on the server. In short, it is a way for someone to pay to stand out.</p>

<p>You can buy boosts separately from Nitro at $5 per month or $50 per year. Perks come in uneven tiers: Level 1 is 2 boosts, Level 2 is 15 boosts, Level 3 is 30 boosts. It is unlikely “friend group sized” servers get past two boosts, but large servers often pass thirty. Some examples:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="left">Name</th><th data-align="left">Boosts</th><th data-align="left">MRR (@ $5 per boost)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="left">Minecraft</td><td data-align="left">165</td><td data-align="left">$825</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Kanye</td><td data-align="left">75</td><td data-align="left">$375</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Fortnite</td><td data-align="left">165</td><td data-align="left">$825</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">r/LeagueOfLegends</td><td data-align="left">201</td><td data-align="left">$1005</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</td><td data-align="left">412</td><td data-align="left">$2060</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">r/Overwatch</td><td data-align="left">85</td><td data-align="left">$425</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Rocket League</td><td data-align="left">116</td><td data-align="left">$580</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Fall Guys</td><td data-align="left">215</td><td data-align="left">$1075</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Anime Soul Discord</td><td data-align="left">323</td><td data-align="left">$1615</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Kenny Beats</td><td data-align="left">50</td><td data-align="left">$250</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Musicians (Turkish)</td><td data-align="left">730</td><td data-align="left">$3650</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">English</td><td data-align="left">94</td><td data-align="left">$470</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Python</td><td data-align="left">44</td><td data-align="left">$220</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">CallMeCarson Discord Cult</td><td data-align="left">1153</td><td data-align="left">$5765</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Here are 14 popular servers accounting for nearly $250,000 in revenue per year. There are tons more, all with varying amounts of boosts. People are willing to pay to stand out, even when there is no obvious benefit. This is universal.</p>



<p>Every community needs a place to communicate online. Discord has the best offering, and it is free. Other platforms either force you to pay by the member or have a flat rate paid by the community host. Discord doesn’t require either. Servers can grow as large as they want for free, moderators and admins don’t have to pay, and Discord still makes money.</p>



<p>As communities continue to grow on Discord, the money Discord makes from those communities goes up as well. Flat rates and tiers limit this. Communities want to grow, Discord provides them with an easy and effective way to do that. Users want status, Discord gives them a shortcut. This aligns incentives better than advertising or paid memberships do.</p>



<hr>



<p>Discord won by building 10x better spaces for communities. By selling status, they have also managed to capture more value from those communities than other platforms.</p>



<p>Discord won the competition for the gaming chat platform of choice, and now it wants to be the platform for all internet communities. This means they will be competing with the “big dogs” like Slack, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Microsoft, and Epic. Their free-to-play, pay-for-status monetization model is a competitive advantage.</p>



<p>Discord is a successful company. The question becomes how successful can they become? The key is the number of internet communities who choose Discord as their home. By creating a better product than competitors and being free for growth, Discord puts itself in an excellent position to continue to succeed moving forward.</p>

						<p>The question of how scientific advances flow through to practical applications is central to our understanding of progress, and guides research funding policy.</p>
<p>The tone on this issue for the second half of the 20th century was set in 1945 by Vannevar Bush’s landmark report “<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm">Science, the Endless Frontier</a>”. One theme, already widely accepted in American industrial culture and given official voice in Bush’s report, was that basic research, although not guided by practical uses, is nonetheless necessary for long-term progress:</p>
<blockquote><p>Basic research is performed without thought of practical ends. … The scientist doing basic research may not be at all interested in the practical applications of his work, yet the further progress of industrial development would eventually stagnate if basic scientific research were long neglected.</p></blockquote>
<p>By the early 1950s, the newly created National Science Foundation was justifying its mission based on an explicit model of technological development as a flow from basic research through to development. Quoting from the NSF’s <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/1952/annualreports/ar_1952_sec2.pdf">second annual report</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The technological sequence consists of basic research, applied research, and development… each of the successive stages depends upon the preceding. Unlimited expansion of effort toward applied research and development, without corresponding support for basic research, will defeat the entire effort by limiting technological progress to minor improvements and refinements of obsolete processes and equipment.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is an important truth in this “linear model” of innovation. But there is also much more interaction between science and invention than a naive interpretation of the model would imply.</p>
<p>The truth in the model is that science is, in an important sense, the foundation for invention. The <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/why-ac-won">electric power industry</a> would not have been possible before the science of electromagnetism: Michael Faraday’s 1831 discovery that a moving magnet creates a current in a nearby wire is the law that the electric generator, deployed widely decades later, depends on. Plastics were not created until chemistry was well-established: the first synthetic plastic, Bakelite, was created by a Belgian-American chemist, Leo Baekeland, after <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/bakelite.html#invention-of-bakelite">careful experimentation</a> inspired by the potential of phenol-formaldehyde compounds established by previous researchers.</p>
<p>Technological development is possible through ad-hoc tinkering, but without a scientific base, such development eventually plateaus. Sanitation reformers made only limited progress against disease before the germ theory, because they were guided only by perceptible qualities such as the look, smell, and taste of the water supply. The understanding that microbes were the cause of disease refined their understanding of the goal and gave them new ways to measure the success of their efforts. It was after this, for example, that <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/draining-the-swamp">chlorination was added to water treatment</a>, and pasteurization to food processing.</p>
<p>Practical applications often flow naturally from science: a deeper understanding of nature suggests possible uses. But science does not flow from applications, because it is not obvious <i>what </i>science might apply to a given problem. As <a href="https://gemenne.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/nelson-basic-economics-of-scientific-research.pdf">Richard Nelson pointed out</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is seriously to be doubted whether X-ray analysis would ever have been discovered by any group of scientists who, at the turn of the century, decided to find a means for examining the inner organs of the body … It seems most unlikely that a group of scientists in the mid-nineteenth century, attempting to develop a better method of long-range communication, would have developed Maxwell’s equations and radio.</p></blockquote>
<p>The impact of science on invention is long-term and often impossible to foresee. There are some times, certainly, when scientific pursuits have obvious applications: when Robert Koch identified the bacteria responsible for tuberculosis, he must have known that this would someday help us prevent or cure the disease. But when Bohr peered into the structure of the atom, or when Rutherford and Curie investigated the nature of radiation, it is doubtful that they expected their work to lead to nuclear power or MRI scans.</p>
<p>Investments in science, then, if motivated by long-term progress, cannot be prioritized by immediate practical impact. It requires, in Bush’s words, “the free play of free intellects, working on subjects of their own choice, in the manner dictated by their curiosity for exploration of the unknown.”</p>
<p>However, in the naive interpretation of this model, the stages are fully distinct, non-overlapping, and separated by a clean handoff. Science is pursued out of pure curiosity, with no thought of applications. It discovers elegant natural laws, which are crisply formulated, written down, and then thrown over the transom to engineering. Invention is then a straightforward process of deductively applying these laws to practical problems.</p>
<p>But the relationship between science and invention is not one-way. It is reciprocal.</p>
<p>Invention is rarely, if ever, a pure deduction from established physical laws. Inventors tinker, often right at the boundaries of scientific knowledge—where the best opportunities are. Edison famously tested thousands of materials as filaments for his light bulb to find one that would last long enough to make the bulb economical. Charles Goodyear <a href="https://lemelson.mit.edu/resources/charles-goodyear">experimented for many years</a> to create an improved form of rubber that would not become soft in the heat or brittle in the cold, finally hitting on pressure-treating with sulfur as the key process to create what he would call “vulcanized”&nbsp;rubber. Even today, drugs are discovered by screening thousands of compounds against a target.</p>
<p>Science, of course, often <i>guides</i> this experimentation. Edison was specifically <a href="http://edison.rutgers.edu/lamp.htm">looking for a high-resistance material</a>; he knew from his understanding of the physics of electric circuits that a high-resistance bulb would require less power. Drug compounds, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2790789/">including some early antibiotics</a>, are discovered by modifying “side chains” of a known molecule. Without scientific background knowledge, pure tinkering often has too many possibilities to explore; science narrows the search.</p>
<p>Sometimes when an invention is produced by tinkering, science cannot explain its operating characteristics, or even why it works at all. Aspirin was first marketed in 1899, but its mechanism of action <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20631416/">wasn’t explained until 1971</a>. These cases can inspire new theories or even entire new fields. The field of thermodynamics was created in the 1800s in part to explain the working of heat engines, such as the steam engines that had been invented in the previous century. A better scientific understanding of technology then helps us optimize or expand it. The first vaccine, for smallpox, was <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/smallpox-and-vaccines">invented in 1796</a>, but no one was able to replicate this success for any other disease until almost ninety years later, after the advent of the germ theory.</p>
<p>When the right researchers are brought together in the right environment, this iterative process combining both science and engineering can even be driven forward by the same people, in the same lab, on a single project. A dramatic example is <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/transistors-science-and-invention">the invention of the transistor at Bell Labs</a>. Researchers went back to the drawing board multiple times to improve the theory of semiconductor physics, in order to explain their experimental results. Each improvement to the theory let them make the next advance in engineering: from failed prototypes, to the first working “point-contact” transistor, to the improved “junction” transistor that became the standard design.</p>
<p>Some of the greatest researchers were those who were able to pivot rapidly from discovery to invention, or vice versa, as the opportunity arose. The master of this was <a href="https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/louis-pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a>, a pioneer of microbiology. Some of his greatest scientific discoveries came from projects with purely practical, commercial goals. His work to improve the processes of wine, beer, and vinegar makers led to the discovery of anaerobic metabolism and the role of microbes in fermentation; his assistance to the growers of silk worms gave him observations that ultimately led to the germ theory of disease. At other times, while engaged in scientific research, Pasteur was able to seize on an accidental discovery when he saw its practical applications. This is how a botched experiment with chicken cholera led to <a href="https://www.vbivaccines.com/wire/louis-pasteur-attenuated-vaccine/">the first laboratory-created vaccines</a>, including a vaccine for rabies.</p>
<p>So the “clean handoff” model is wrong. Instead, we should replace it with a “gap” model. Science gives inventors a conceptual framework: a toolbox of categories, principles, and equations that provide fertile ground for practical experimentation. But through experimentation, inventors can discover working solutions outside the bounds of what has been fully explained by science. They can’t get <i>too </i>far ahead of scientific understanding—Bell Labs would never even have created a semiconductor research group if physics hadn’t first identified semiconductors as a material.</p>
<p>But if the distance between known science and a desired invention is short enough, they can cross the gap. They can bridge the gap with their own experiments, extending scientific knowledge; or they can leap over it, ending up with an invention that works for reasons yet to be explained. Leaping the gap can actually pull science forward, giving it new phenomena to explore and new motivation to do so.</p>

October 19, 2020 | https://anarc.at/blog/2020-10-19-google-authenticator-libpam/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://anarc.at/blog/2020-10-19-google-authenticator-libpam/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">


          

            <p>About a lifetime ago (5 years), I wrote a <a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2015-12-14-yubikey-howto/">tutorial on how to
configure my Yubikey for OpenPGP signing, SSH authentication and SSH
2FA</a>. In there, I used the <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/oath-toolkit/">libpam-oath</a>
PAM plugin for authentication, but it turns out that had too many
problems: <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=807992">users couldn't edit their own 2FA tokens</a> and I had to
patch it to <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=807990">avoid forcing 2FA on all users</a>. The latter was merged
in the Debian package, but never upstream, and the former was never
fixed at all. So I started looking at alternatives and found the
<a href="https://github.com/google/google-authenticator-libpam/">Google Authenticator libpam plugin</a>. A priori, it's designed to
work with phones and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator">Google Authenticator app</a>, but there's no
reason why it shouldn't work with hardware tokens like the
Yubikey. Both use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC-based_One-time_Password_algorithm">standard HOTP protocol</a> so it should "just
work".</p>

<p>After some fiddling, it turns out I was right and you <em>can</em>
authenticate with a Yubikey over SSH. Here's that procedure so you
don't have to second-guess it yourself.</p>






<p>On Debian, the PAM module is shipped in the <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/google-authenticator">google-authenticator</a>
source package:</p>

<pre><code>apt install libpam-google-authenticator
</code></pre>

<p>Then you need to add the module in your PAM stack somewhere. Since I
only use it for SSH, I added this line on top of <code>/etc/pam.d/sshd</code>:</p>

<pre><code>auth required pam_google_authenticator.so nullok
</code></pre>

<p>I also used <code>no_increment_hotp debug</code> while debugging to avoid having
to renew the token all the time and have more information about
failures in the logs.</p>

<p>Then reload ssh (not sure that's actually necessary):</p>

<pre><code>service ssh reload
</code></pre>



<p>To create a new key, run this command on the server:</p>

<pre><code>google-authenticator -c
</code></pre>

<p>This will prompt you for a bunch of questions. To get them all right,
I prefer to just call the right ones on the commandline directly:</p>

<pre><code>google-authenticator --counter-based --qr-mode=NONE --rate-limit=1 --rate-time=30 --emergency-codes=1 --window-size=3
</code></pre>

<p>Those are actually the defaults, if my memory serves me right, except
for the <code>--qr-mode</code> and <code>--emergency-codes</code> (which can't be disabled
so I only print one). I disable the QR code display because I won't be
using the codes on my phone, but you would obviously keep it if you
want to use the app.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the encoding (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3548#section-5">base32</a>) produced by the
<code>google-authenticator</code> command is not compatible with the token
expected by the <code>ykpersonalize</code> command used to configure the Yubikey
(<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3548#page-8">base16</a> AKA "hexadecimal", with a fixed 20 bytes length). So you
need a way to convert between the two. I wrote a program called
<a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/scripts/blob/master/oath-convert">oath-convert</a> which basically does this:</p>

<pre><code>read base32
add padding
convert to hex
print
</code></pre>

<p>Or, in Python:</p>

<div><pre><span>def</span> <span>convert_b32_b16</span><span>(</span>data_b32<span>):</span>
    remainder <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span>data_b32<span>) %</span> <span>8</span>
    <span>if</span> remainder <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span>
        <span># XXX: assume 6 chars are missing, the actual padding may vary:</span>
        <span># https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3548#section-5</span>
        data_b32 <span>+=</span> <span>"======"</span>
    data_b16 <span>=</span> base64<span>.</span><span>b32decode</span><span>(</span>data_b32<span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span>data_b16<span>) &lt;</span> <span>20</span><span>:</span>
        <span># pad to 20 bytes</span>
        data_b16 <span>+=</span> b<span>"</span><span>\x00</span><span>"</span> <span>* (</span><span>20</span> <span>-</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span>data_b16<span>))</span>
    <span>return</span> binascii<span>.</span><span>hexlify</span><span>(</span>data_b16<span>).</span><span>decode</span><span>(</span><span>"ascii"</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Note that the code assumes a certain token length and will not work
correctly for other sizes. To use the program, simply call it with:</p>

<pre><code>head -1 .google_authenticator | oath-convert
</code></pre>

<p>Then you paste the output in the prompt:</p>

<pre><code>$ ykpersonalize -1 -o oath-hotp -o append-cr -a
Firmware version 3.4.3 Touch level 1541 Program sequence 2
 HMAC key, 20 bytes (40 characters hex) : [SECRET GOES HERE]

Configuration data to be written to key configuration 1:

fixed: m:
uid: n/a
key: h:[SECRET REDACTED]
acc_code: h:000000000000
OATH IMF: h:0
ticket_flags: APPEND_CR|OATH_HOTP
config_flags: 
extended_flags: 

Commit? (y/n) [n]: y
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you must NOT pass the <code>-o oath-hotp8</code> parameter to the
<code>ykpersonalize</code> commandline, which we used to do in the <a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2015-12-14-yubikey-howto/">Yubikey
howto</a>. That is because Google Authenticator
tokens are shorter: it's less secure, but it's an acceptable tradeoff
considering the plugin is actually maintained. There's actually a
<a href="https://github.com/google/google-authenticator-libpam/issues/20">feature request to support 8-digit codes</a> so that limitation might
eventually be fixed as well.</p>

<p>Thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/google/google-authenticator-libpam/issues/186">Google Authenticator people</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-personalization/issues/169">Yubikey people</a>
for their support in establishing this procedure.</p>

        <blockquote><p>Experienced programmers have tales to tell about the things they had to do to test and debug their applications. They agree on one thing: The bad ol’ days of development are best left in the past.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’d been typing my code into a Model 33 teletype keyboard for a while, and I was anxious to see if my application worked. The teletype was attached to a General Electric model 225 computer located at Dartmouth College. The language that I was using, late in the summer of 1964, was <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/basicfifty/commands.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dartmouth BASIC</a>.</p>
<p>I typed “RUN” and almost immediately the printer came to life. “WHAT?” it said. I printed out the program code and found what I thought might be a mistake. I typed in the code again (I hadn’t yet discovered the <code>OLD</code> command), typed <code>RUN</code>, and waited. Seconds later, I got the response. “WHAT?” the printer said. Somebody at GE apparently decided that I’d wasted enough of <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~learnest/nets/timesharing.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their time-share time</a>, because I never got another chance.</p>
<p>But what I <em>did</em> experience was the challenge of debugging software, especially in the old days when QA tools didn’t exist, there was little help because almost no one at the time had ever written a program in BASIC, and I didn’t really know what I was doing anyway.</p>
<p>Other languages were similarly limited. When I managed programmers in a COBOL shop years later, debugging consisted of creating vastly long print-outs, taping them to the walls, and documenting the program flow with colored pencils. It was during one such session in the mid-1980s when an unhappy voice from the back of the room began excoriating me for using COBOL.</p>
<p>Standing there, petite and trim, was an elderly Admiral who was clearly not impressed. “You should be using C,” <a href="https://computerhistory.org/profile/grace-murray-hopper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Admiral Grace Hopper</a> told me. Admiral Hopper, who designed FLOW-MATIC, the immediate precursor to COBOL, clearly didn’t think her work was the right answer to serving the military. She was right, of course, but I didn’t have the appropriation to pay for changes.</p>
<h3>Printfs and other joys</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/6-ways-to-improve-your-debugging-skills/">debugging and testing</a> software was like that even at the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Depending on the language and the application, developers usually had to create their own tools in order to determine what a program was doing as it executed. There were some exceptions, such as the <a href="https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Consumer/Archive-Byte-IDX/IDX/80s/88-90/Byte-1990-Vol-15-No-11-Fall-OCR-Page-0250.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hardware-assisted debuggers from Periscope</a> in the late 1980s and early 1990s. And debuggers like the one built into the <a href="http://www.aztecmuseum.ca/intro.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manx Aztec C compiler</a> could generate symbol tables that could be fed into SID, a debugger from Digital Research for CP/M-80. But each of the early testing tools required brute-force effort, such as setting breakpoints, running step-by-step at the source code level, and dumping the call stack.</p>
<p>Finding out when loops worked as intended and exited when they were supposed to sometimes meant embedding errors at specific points in the code; the crash and subsequent memory dump would show the state of execution at the time.</p>
<p>“This then allowed the programmer to examine all aspects of the program at a point in time,” says zOS programmer Mark Jacobs discussing software debugging in the old days.</p>
<p>Bruce Marold, now retired, once worked in software development. He had similar experiences working on a Fortran IV project. “My first major software project was on a timesharing Fortran IV on a teletype with no debugging resources at all. Even worse, Fortran seemed to be aggressively non-modular. Sometimes GOTO was unavoidable. I had to use brute force to locate glitches.” Marold had to calculate results in the biostatistical application by hand to verify that his program was getting the right answer.</p>
<p>There were other approaches. Some programmers embedded printf commands in their code to stop execution so they could examine the state of the machine – and many still do! Farther back, programmers would single-step through a program, watching indicator lights on the computer’s front panel to follow program execution.</p>
<p>George Dinwiddie, an independent software development consultant, tells of having to build his own circuit emulator. “Every time I had to edit code, I had to burn new <a href="https://ecomputernotes.com/fundamental/input-output-and-memory/eprom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EPROMs</a>,” Dinwiddie said. “I made an emulator to avoid that. The next week, instead of doing four iterations of finding a problem and editing code, I was able to do a couple dozen because I didn’t have to burn EPROMs.”</p>
<h3>An entire herd of yaks to shave</h3>
<p>QA testing is hard enough, but in earlier eras, developers and testers had little debugging support. Developers had to create their own testing methods and debugging tools, <a href="https://seths.blog/2005/03/dont_shave_that/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which consumed more time</a>. Plus, a lack of common test methods and procedures hurt accuracy.</p>
<p>Fortunately, things have changed. Perhaps the biggest change is the idea that <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-importance-of-planning-your-tests/">developers should plan for testing</a> in the first place. “Figuring out how you’re going to test before you build it is a huge advance,” says Dinwiddie. “With software you can build in tests.”</p>
<p>Preparing for testing leads to the ability to automate testing. “When I got the idea of ‘test first,’ in 2000, it really changed the way I thought about creating software,” Dinwiddie says. “Instead of seeing if it worked, I changed to the idea of asking the code to do what I wanted it to do.” Now he can worry about what he wants to accomplish, and then perform testing in little steps.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.”—Brian W. Kernighan</p></blockquote>
<p>“The most significant difference between software testing in the past and present is the <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/automated-functional-testing-101/">reliance on automated testing</a>,” says Yaniv Masjedi, CMO of <a href="https://www.nextiva.com/">Nextiva</a>, a voice-over-internet-protocol company. “The perception that manual testing is more accurate and gives fewer errors is an obsolete concept of the past. Modern testing software can provide the same output at a much faster pace without compromising test quality.”</p>
<p>Mostly, testing took longer – which meant it was slower to roll out new versions. “In the past, software testing was slower because it involved testing the software with little historical data and limited technology to automate tests,” says Denis Leclair, VP engineering at Trellis. Testing takes time today because historical data can predict possible outcomes. “It is now possible to automate software tests, which reduces the time spent overall in the software testing process,” he adds.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean that some older aspects of testing aren’t still useful. “In the past, there were <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/5-reasons-why-qa-needs-humans/">more interactions between members of the software testing process</a>, and these regular meetings develop many innovative strategies to test software,” says Leclair. “If applied today, software testing will see significant developments based on constant knowledge sharing.”</p>
<p>While there is some nostalgia for the challenges of the good ol’ days, developers acknowledge that software development and testing has improved – not the least of which is hiring dedicated QA staff rather than waiting for users to file bug reports.</p>
<p>Of course most testing today avoids the intellectual team-building that happened while developers tried to figure out why their applications failed. That’s not all gone. Instead, those challenges have moved to designing reliable, mostly automated, testing. There may be less drama that way, but the result is a better product.</p>
<blockquote><p>Naturally, at Functionize we think we offer a better path for anyone who wants to test software, automate test suites, and ensure application quality. Won’t you take a few minutes to <a href="https://www.functionize.com/test-creation/">explore its features</a> and learn more?</p></blockquote>

<p>When I realized that I cannot apply common image processing pipelines in medical images, I was completely discouraged. Why does such functionality not exist? So, I made up this post for discouraged individuals who, like me, are interested in solving medical imaging problems.</p>

<p>We have already discussed medical image segmentation and some initial background on <a href="https://theaisummer.com/medical-image-coordinates/" target="_blank">coordinate systems </a>and DICOM files. My experience in the field leads me to continue with data understanding, preprocessing, and some augmentations. As I always say, if you merely understand your data and their particularities, you are probably playing bingo. In the field of medical imaging, I find some data manipulations, which are heavily used in preprocessing and augmentation in state-of-the-art methods, to be critical in our understanding. To this end, I provide a notebook for everyone to play around. It performs transformations on medical images, which is simply a 3D structured grid.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The accompanying notebook on google colab can be found <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fyU_YaZUO3B5qVzBJwGoYZ6XVvVLog30?usp=sharing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Data</strong>: We will play with 2 MRI images that are provided from nibabel (python library) for illustration purposes. The images are stored as nifty files. But before that, let’s write up some code to visualize the 3D medical volumes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The images will be shown in 3 planes: sagittal, coronal, axial looking from left to right throughout this post.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole tutorial, we will extensively use a function that visualizes the three median slices in the <strong>sagittal, coronal, and axial</strong> planes respectively. Let’s write some minimal function to do so:</p>

<p>Nothing more than matplotlib’s “<code>imshow"</code> and numpy’s array manipulations. For the record, medical images are a single channel and we visualize them in grayscale colors.</p>

<p>The two images that we will use to play with a plethora of transformations can be illustrated below:</p>

<em>The initial brain MRI images that we will use.</em></p>

<p>Now we are good to go! Let’s commence with resize and rescale in medical images. Yeap, it’s not exactly the same.</p>

<h2 id="1-medical-image-resizing-downup-sampling">1. Medical image resizing (down/up-sampling)</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.scipy.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">scipy</a> library provides a lot of functionalities for multi-dimensional images. Since medical images are three dimensional, a lot of functionalities can be used. This time we will use <strong>scipy.ndimage.interpolation.zoom</strong> for resizing the image in the desired dimensions. This is similar to downsampling in a 2D image. The same function can be used for interpolation to increase the spatial dimensions. As an illustration, we will double and half the original image size.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Keep in mind that in this kind of transformation the ratios are usually important to be maintained.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You probably don’t want to lose the anatomy of the human body :)</p>

<p>This kind of scaling is usually called isometric. Honestly, I am not a big fan of the scipy’s terminology to use the word zoom for this functionality.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/medical-image-processing/resized-mri-images.png" alt="resized-mri-images">
<em>Downsampled and upsampled image by a factor of 2</em></p>

<p>It is very common to downsample the image in a lower dimension for heavy machine learning.</p>

<p>Note that there is another type of resizing. Instead of providing the desired output shape, you specify the desired voxel size(i.e. voxel_size=(1,1,1) mm). Nibabel provides a function called resample_to_output(). It works with nifti files and not with numpy arrays. Honestly, I wouldn’t recommend it alone since the resulting images might not have the same shape. This may be a problem for deep learning. For example to create batches with dataloaders the dimension should be consistent across instances. However, you may choose to include it in a previous step in your pipeline. It can be used to bring different images to have the same or similar voxel size.</p>

<h2 id="2-medical-image-rescaling-zoom--inout">2. Medical image rescaling (zoom- in/out)</h2>

<p>Rescaling can be regarded as an affine transformation. We will randomly zoom in and out of the image. <strong>This augmentation usually helps the model to learn scale-invariant features.</strong></p>

<p>The next one on the list is 3D rotation.</p>

<h2 id="3-3d-medical-image-rotation">3. 3D Medical image rotation</h2>

<p>Rotation is one of the most common methods to achieve data augmentation in computer vision. It has also been considered a self-supervised technique with remarkable results [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07728" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Spyros Gidaris et al.</a> ].</p>

<p>In medical imaging, it is an equal import functionality that has also been used from self-supervised pretraining [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02241" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xinrui Zhuang et al. 2019 </a>]. A simple random 3D rotation in a given range of degrees can be illustrated with the code below:</p>

<em>Random 3D rotation</em></p>

<p>We simply have to define the axis and the rotation angle. As scaling provided the model with more diversity in order to learn scale-invariant features, rotation aids in learning rotation-invariant features.</p>

<p>Next in our list is image flipping.</p>

<h2 id="4-3d-medical-image-flip">4. 3D medical image flip</h2>

<p>Similar to common RGB images, we can perform axis flipping in medical images. At this point, it is really important to clarify one thing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we perform augmentations and/or preprocessing in our data, we may have to apply similar operations on the ground truth data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For instance, if we tackle the task of <a href="https://theaisummer.com/medical-image-deep-learning/" target="_blank">medical image segmentation</a>, it is important to flip the target segmentation map. A simple implementation can be found below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>def</span> <span>random_flip</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>,</span> <span>label</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>):</span>

<em>The initial image as a reference and two flipped versions</em></p>

<p>Observe that by flipping one axis, two views change. The first image on top is the initial image as a reference.</p>

<h2 id="5-medical-image-shifting-displacement">5. Medical image shifting (displacement)</h2>

<p>Here I would like to tell something else.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rotation, shifting, and scaling are nothing more than affine transformations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes I implement them by just defining the affine transformations and apply it in the image with scipy, and sometimes I use the already-implemented functions for multi-dimensional image processing.</p>

<p>In order to use this operation in my data augmentation pipeline, you can see that I have included a wrapper function. The latter basically samples a random number, usually in the desired range, and calls the affine transformation function. Below is the implementation for random shifting/displacement.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><h2>Introducing</h2><h2>Incognito Email Addresses</h2><h2>2020-10-18</h2><p>We use email for everything – from our banking, healthcare, and government accounts, to online shopping, entertainment, and talking with friends and family.</p><h3>The Problem</h3><p>Email is an incredible tool – but widespread use of our personal email addresses has made them a profitable target for advertisers and criminals.</p><h4>Advertisers</h4><p>For advertisers, your personal data is a gold mine and your email address is the perfect tool to identify you.</p><p>Your personal email address is globally unique, and it's become second nature to share it freely with service providers, retailers, and other organizations. However, that means any two companies that both have your personal email address can easily trade information about you.</p><p>Recently, it has become common for companies to sell our personal information. Even governments are starting to sell your personal information – both the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/evjekz/the-california-dmv-is-making-dollar50m-a-year-selling-drivers-personal-information">California DMV</a> and the <a href="https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/local-news/i-team-investigates/i-team-florida-dmv-sells-your-personal-information-to-private-companies-marketing-firms">Florida DMV</a> have been found selling citizens' private data to make money.</p><h4>Criminals</h4><p>For criminals, your inbox is a doorway to identity and financial theft.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://www.phishingbox.com/assets/files/images/Verizon-Data-Breach-Investigations-Report-DBIR-2019.pdf">Verizon Data Breach Report</a>, 94% of malware is sent over email and 31% of all data breaches included a phishing element. Attackers know that if a well-disguised email (often masquerading as a trusted source, or using leaked information associated with your personal email address) arrives in your inbox, there's a good chance you'll click the link, or open the file — which is often all they need to hook you as their next victim.</p><h3>The Solution</h3><p>Anonymous, service specific, and replaceable email addresses – incognito addresses.</p><p>Many email providers have spam blockers, but they don't catch all unwanted mail, and spam is only one barrier to a quieter, safer inbox. Incognito addresses fill in the security and privacy gap where existing email providers fall short.</p><h4>Anonymous</h4><p>Using an anonymous email address for each online service (e.g. bigstore.com, socialbook.com, videobox.com) gives you more control over which companies have access to your online identity. Email address anonymity makes it difficult for advertisers to share and sell your data without your consent, and it makes it difficult for criminals to deploy personalized or targeted attacks.</p><h4>Service Specific</h4><p>By creating a unique, anonymous email address for each online service, you make it impossible for advertisers or criminals to create identifying associations with your email alone.</p><p>In addition, using a unique email address for each service enables Owl Mail to alert you if any inbound emails are from an unexpected sender – preventing spam from reaching your inbox, and illuminating when companies may have had a data breach or sold your incognito email address.</p><h4>Replaceable</h4><p>If your personal email address is sold by a company, or leaked in a data breach, there isn't much you can do in response. Your family, friends, and co-workers reach you at that address, so it's difficult to abandon. All you can do is hope your email service is winning the war on your always-increasing spam.</p><p>In contrast, incognito addresses are easily destroyed and replaced. If you discover an incognito address has been leaked, just delete and replace it – stop spam before it begins!</p><h3>The Future</h3><p>Incognito address are a major step toward better privacy and security online. But, that's just the start. At Owl Mail, we plan to build the world's best email tools – creating a spam, phishing, and malware free experience with easy-to-use end-to-end encryption to all of your messages.</p><p>We hope you are as excited about quieter, safer email as we are.</p><p><span><a href="https://owlmail.io/sign-in">Try Incognito Addresses</a></span></p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

    <p>The regular Git users amongst you will be familiar with the diff output that breaks down into “hunks” like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@@ -24,7 +24,7 @@</span> class TicketPdf
     ApplicationController.render(
       "tickets/index.html.haml",
       layout: "tickets",
<span>-      assigns: { tickets: tickets }
</span><span>+      assigns: { tickets: tickets, event_name: event_name }
</span>     )
   end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first line (starting <code>@@</code>) is known as the hunk header, and is there to help orientate the change. It gives us the line numbers for the change (the numbers between the <code>@@..@@</code>), but also a textual description for the enclosing context where the change happened, in this example <code>"class TicketPdf"</code>. Git tries to figure out this enclosing context, whether it’s a function, module or class definition. For C-like languages it’s pretty good at this. But for the Ruby example above it’s failed to show us the immediate context, which is actually a method called <code>tickets_as_html</code>. That’s because out of the box Git isn’t able to recognise the Ruby syntax for a method definition, which would be <code>def ticket_as_html</code>.</p>

<p>What we really want to see is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@@ -24,7 +24,7 @@</span> def tickets_as_html
     ApplicationController.render(
       "tickets/index.html.haml",
       layout: "tickets",
<span>-      assigns: { tickets: tickets }
</span><span>+      assigns: { tickets: tickets, event_name: event_name }
</span>     )
   end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And it’s not just Ruby where Git struggles to figure out the correct enclosing context. Many other programming languages and file formats also get short-changed when it comes to the hunk header context.</p>

<p>Thankfully, it’s not only possible to configure a custom regex specific to your language to help Git better orient itself, there’s even a pre-defined set of <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/userdiff.c">patterns for many languages and formats right there in Git</a>. All we have to do is tell Git which patterns to use for our file extensions.</p>

<p>We can do this by defining a <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes"><code>.gitattributes</code></a> file inside our repo that maps the Ruby file extensions to the diff pattern for Ruby:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>*</span>.rb <span>diff</span><span>=</span>ruby
<span>*</span>.rake <span>diff</span><span>=</span>ruby
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some open source projects define their own <code>.gitattributes</code> file. There’s <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/.gitattributes">one in Rails</a>. There’s even <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/.gitattributes">one in the Git source</a> that enables the diff patterns for Perl and Python.</p>

<h2 id="configure-a-global-gitattributes-file">Configure a global .gitattributes file</h2>

<p>Instead of adding a <code>.gitattributes</code> file to every repo we can configure a global <code>.gitattributes</code> file. Just create a <code>.gitattributes</code> file in your home directory, fill it with all the file formats you are interested in and point Git at it:</p>

<pre><code>  <strong>$ git config --global core.attributesfile ~/.gitattributes</strong>
</code></pre>

<p>I’ve put together an <a href="https://gist.github.com/tekin/12500956bd56784728e490d8cef9cb81">example .gitattributes file</a> with some common file formats to get you started.</p>

<p>I have no idea why Git doesn’t have these file format patterns configured by default. Thanks to Tom whose <a href="https://twitter.com/tomstuart/status/1304401459069452290">exasperated tweet</a> brought this non-obvious feature to my attention.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Postgres provides great search capability out of the box. For the majority of Django apps there is no need to run and maintain an ElasticSearch cluster unless you need the advanced features ElasticSearch offers. Django integrates nicely with the Postgres search through the built in <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/postgres/">Postgres module</a>.</p>
<p>For small data sets the default configuration performs well, however when your data grows in size the default search configuration becomes painfully slow and we need to enable certain optimizations to keep our queries fast.</p>
<p>This page will walk you through setting up Django and Postgres, indexing sample data and performing and optimizing full text search.</p>
<p>The examples go through a Django + Postgres setup, however the advice is generally applicable to any programming language or framework as long as it uses Postgres.</p>
<p><strong>If you're already a Django veteran you can skip the first steps and jump right into the optimization.</strong></p>

<li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="project-setup"><a id="project-setup"></a>Project setup</h2>
<p>Create the directories and setup the Django project.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>mkdir django_postgres
<span>cd</span> django_postgres
python -m venv venv
<span>source</span> venv/bin/activate
pip install django
django-admin startproject full_text_search
<span>cd</span> full_text_search
./manage.py startapp web
</pre></div>


<p>Now we'll need to install 3 dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>psycopg2: the Postgres client library for Python</li>
<li>wikipedia: a client library to retrieve Wikipedia articles</li>
<li>django-extensions: to simplify debugging of SQL queries</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><span></span>pip install psycopg2 wikipedia django-extensions
</pre></div>


<p>We also need to run Postgres locally. I'll use a dockerized version of Postgres here since it's easier to set up, but feel free to install a Postgres binary if you'd like.</p>
<p>Open <code>full_text_search/docker-compose.yml</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>---</span>
<span>version</span><span>:</span> <span>'2.4'</span>
<span>services</span><span>:</span>
  <span>postgres</span><span>:</span>
    <span>image</span><span>:</span> <span>postgres:11-alpine</span>
    <span>ports</span><span>:</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>'5432:5432'</span>
    <span>environment</span><span>:</span>
      <span># Set the Postgres environment variables for bootstrapping the default</span>
      <span># database and user.</span>
      <span>POSTGRES_DB</span><span>:</span> <span>"my_db"</span>
      <span>POSTGRES_USER</span><span>:</span> <span>"me"</span>
      <span>POSTGRES_PASSWORD</span><span>:</span> <span>"password"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The project structure should now look like the output below. We'll ignore the venv directory as that is packed with files and irrelevant for now.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ tree -I venv
.

        ├── tests.py
        └── views.py

<span>5</span> directories, <span>15</span> files
</pre></div>


<p>We will modify the default database settings to use Postgres instead of SQLite.  In settings.py change the <code>DATABASES</code> attribute:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>DATABASES</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"default"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"ENGINE"</span><span>:</span> <span>"django.db.backends.postgresql"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"NAME"</span><span>:</span> <span>"my_db"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"USER"</span><span>:</span> <span>"me"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"PASSWORD"</span><span>:</span> <span>"password"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"HOST"</span><span>:</span> <span>"localhost"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"PORT"</span><span>:</span> <span>"5432"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"OPTIONS"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>"connect_timeout"</span><span>:</span> <span>2</span><span>},</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We will also modify our <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> to include a few apps:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>django.contrib.postgres</code> the Postgres module for Django which is required for full text search</li>
<li><code>django_extensions</code> to print SQL logs when executing queries in Python</li>
<li>our <code>web</code> app</li>
</ul>
<p>Open <code>full_text_search/settings.py</code> and modify:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>INSTALLED_APPS</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>'django.contrib.admin'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>'django.contrib.auth'</span><span>,</span>

    <span>'django_extensions'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>'web'</span><span>,</span>
<span>]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Start Postgres and Django.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>cd</span> full_text_search
docker-compose up -d
./manage.py runserver
</pre></div>


<p>If we open our browser and enter http://localhost:8000 we should see a successful installation.</p>
<p>[image "django_installation_complete.png" not found]</p>
<h2 id="creating-models-and-indexing-sample-data"><a id="creating-models"></a>Creating models and indexing sample data</h2>
<p>Suppose we have a model which represents a Wikipedia page. For simplicity we'll use two fields: title and content.</p>
<p>Open <code>full_text_search/web/models.py</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>django.db</span> <span>import</span> <span>models</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Page</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>

    <span>content</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>TextField</span><span>()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now run the migrations to create the model.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>cd</span> full_text_search
./manage.py makemigrations <span>&amp;&amp;</span> ./manage.py migrate
No changes detected

</pre></div>


<p>We'll use a script to index random wikipedia articles and save the contents to Postgres.</p>
<p>Edit <code>web/index_wikipedia.py</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>logging</span>
<span>import</span> <span>wikipedia</span>

</pre></div>


<p>Now let's run our script to index Wikipedia. There will be errors when running the script, but don't worry about those as long as we manage to store a few hundred articles. The script will take a while to run so grab a cup of coffee and return in a few minutes.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>./</span><span>manage</span><span>.</span><span>py</span> <span>shell_plus</span>

<h2 id="optimizing-the-search"><a id="optimizing-search"></a>Optimizing the search</h2>
<p>Now suppose we want to allow users to perform a full text search on the content.  We'll interactively query our dataset to test the full text search. Open a Django shell session:</p>

<p>Django performs two preparatory queries and finally executes our search query.  Looking at the last query we can at first glance see that the execution was ~315ms for the query execution and serialization alone. That's it far too slow when we want to keep our page load speeds in the double digits in milliseconds.</p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at why this query is performing so slowly.  Open a second terminal where we'll use the excellent <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/reading-an-explain-analyze-query-plan">Postgres query analyzer</a>.  Copy the query from above and run <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code>:</p>

<p>We can note that the query performs a sequential scan over the entire table in order to find matching records. We can likely optimize the query by using an index.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>Filter</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>to_tsvector</span><span>(</span><span>COALESCE</span><span>(</span><span>content</span><span>,</span> <span>''</span><span>::</span><span>text</span><span>))</span> <span>@@</span> <span>plainto_tsquery</span><span>(</span><span>'football'</span><span>::</span><span>text</span><span>))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Additionally the query normalizes the <code>content</code> column from text to a tsvector using <code>to_tsvector</code> in order to perform the full text search.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>WHERE</span> <span>to_tsvector</span><span>(</span><span>COALESCE</span><span>(</span><span>"web_page"</span><span>.</span><span>"content"</span><span>,</span> <span>''</span><span>))</span> <span>@@</span> <span>(</span><span>plainto_tsquery</span><span>(</span><span>'football'</span><span>))</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>tsvector</code> type is a tokenized version of our text which normalizes the search column (more on tokenization <a href="https://www.compose.com/articles/indexing-for-full-text-search-in-postgresql/#tokenization">here</a>). Postgres needs to perform this normalization for every row and each row contains an entire Wikipedia page. This is both a CPU intensive and slow operation.</p>
<h3 id="specialized-search-column-and-gin-indexes"><a id="specialized-column"></a>Specialized search column and gin indexes</h3>
<p>In order avoid on-the-fly casting of text to tsvectors we'll create a specialized column which is used only for search. The column should be populated on inserts or updates. When querying is performed we'll avoid the performance penalty of casting types.</p>
<p>Since we can now have a tsvector type we are also able to add a gin index to speed up the query. The gin index ensures that the search will be performed with a indexed scan instead of a sequential scan over all records.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><img src="https://www.balgan.world/assets/img/tiago.jpg" alt="tiago"></p>

<p>This photo was me a year ago to the day, selling the company I founded five years before.</p>

<p>I thought I’d write some notes about the process and the story.</p>



<p>Until today, there has never been anything more challenging in my life that I have done than running BinaryEdge.</p>

<p>I moved to Switzerland 7 years ago and opened BinaryEdge a little over a year after getting here.</p>

<p>I still remember sitting down with my friend Pekka Jackli and telling him: “I want to open a company that does internet scanning, but I don’t know how to do it. Can you help me ?” (He jumped immediately at the challenge and ended up being a co-founder.)</p>

<p>I had previously founded a security research group (called PTCoreSec) that played around with the idea of internet scanning, so I thought it was time to pick that up again.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balgan.world/assets/img/ptcoresec.png" alt="ptcoresec"></p>

<p>To make sure everyone understands the situation I was in, I decided to open BinaryEdge:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In a country I had just arrived at (1 year is not enough to adapt)</li>
  <li>In a country where I do not speak any of the native languages.</li>
  <li>Never having gone to business school or read a single business book</li>
  <li>Not having any close friends or people I could go to in the country that could provide advice on running a startup</li>
  <li>Having my family to take care of as we moved here for a job</li>
</ul>

<p>Some might wonder why on earth, I would take on this challenge under these conditions instead of trying to make them more optimal first. But here I was just a few years after beating cancer and being stuck in a bed for one year. It had left me with this weird feeling that I had just wasted that one year of my life doing “nothing”, so even if the situation wasn’t perfect, my energy was at an all-time high, if cancer couldn’t stop me, well nothing could.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balgan.world/assets/img/me.jpg" alt="fuck cancer"></p>

<p><strong>PS: Fuck Cancer!</strong></p>

<p>After I spoke with Pekka, we immediately got started figuring out how we would register the company and how we would get some funding.</p>

<p>Pekka introduced me to Till Spillmann, a lawyer-entrepreneur that I had to convince to invest in something that didn’t even exist back then other than in the format of a prototype and PowerPoint!</p>

<p>Sitting down with Till, I showed him evidence that we were doing something different and the problems we wanted to solve (these have changed over the years, and we have slowly refined some of our approaches); I convinced Till to be the first official investor.</p>

<p>This was a great win for team BinaryEdge. Till brought what is typically called smart-money. He brought the needed capital that allowed us to get a small group of developers to start putting together the platform’s first version and all his knowledge and resources as a lawyer.</p>

<p>We started building a better internet scanning platform, improving the types of data we collect and onboard new enterprise customers. (I will go into more in-depth details of the ups and downs of this in a future post!)</p>

<p>At some point, I remember sitting down with <a href="https://www.twitter.com/halvarflake">Thomas Dullien</a>, and asking him for some advice, which ended up with him being the next and last investor ever into BinaryEdge. To this day, bringing Thomas onboard is one of my proudest achievements as there has been no one that has given me as good help or advice as he has. He had already gone through the experience of opening a startup and selling it, so he was the one person that just “got me” and all the headaches and complications I was going through. If you can get Thomas as a friend, investor, or advisor, do it. He is a wonderful human being!</p>

<p>During most of the time of BinaryEdge, I always had a second full-time job. The money BinaryEdge generated was to grow BinaryEdge. I took a salary at the beginning to keep things on track and going but then ended up feeling like the money could be better used to grow the team faster and that I could just deal with having two jobs.</p>



<p>From the moment I met Joshua Motta, I knew joining Coalition to go work with him in some capacity was in my future. When he initially floated the idea by me of Coalition acquiring BinaryEdge (Coalition had already been a customer for a while), we were in a situation where we had the option to raise a funding round or get acquired (by Coalition or 2 other parties that had shown interest), and I had to make a decision.</p>

<p>Our objective was to go down the cyber-insurance path and build a platform to sell cyber-insurance if we had fundraised. This was known to most people as we had already started blogging about it. Cyber insurance is a type of business I was a big believer in from the first day I heard about it, not how the market predominantly currently works but rather the revolutionary way we do it at Coalition and that we wanted to do ourselves.</p>

<p>We had a few other acquisition opportunities on the table from current customers; however, I did not believe we would have been a good fit. I felt strongly I needed to believe in the company that was acquiring us and their business model.</p>

<p>After about two months of the initial conversation, Joshua flew to Zürich and sat down with me Pekka and Till, while Thomas joined remotely. He explained who Coalition was, why they wanted to acquire us, and <a href="https://www.coalitioninc.com/blog/why-we-acquired-binaryedge">the secret master plan</a>.</p>

<p>The fit was perfect, the desire was there by both parties, and with that, we triggered the next phase, which brought the hard part of the process—due diligence. Looking at how much ahead of the market Coalition was business wise made it an easy decision on what I wanted for BinaryEdge.</p>

<p>For about two months, a team of people and lawyers from Coalition passed a comb over every document I signed, every decision I made and asked a LOT of questions. To say that this is a stressful situation is to put it lightly.</p>

<p>Having an M &amp; A Lawyer in the team helped a lot as he knew this process like the back of his hand, which enabled us to get through the diligence at a fantastic pace (compared to some of the stories I have read before).</p>

<p>As it is now public, we ended up being acquired, and we joined the Coalition team; and a few days after the first photo at the beginning of this post, we got on a flight to the USA for the first offsite.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balgan.world/assets/img/be-us.png" alt="offsite"></p>

<p><img src="https://www.balgan.world/assets/img/be-coalition.jpg" alt="offsite2"></p>

<p><strong>So what do we do these days?</strong></p>

<p>I became the General Manager for Customer Security at Coalition. I run the BinaryEdge Enterprise business and build tools to protect our policyholders and bridge the collection done by our team with the underwriting, data, and security team at Coalition.</p>

<p>Florentino flourished into a fantastic engineering manager and runs the engineering team associated with the scanning engine (the team has grown quite a bit since). It has been a privilege to see him evolve over the years.</p>

<p>Tom works with me on growing our enterprise business  (If I were to say Florentino is my right hand, Tom would be my left) while also doing a lot with me on the product management and planning.</p>

<p>Ana continues her career as a data scientist (she is one of the people in my life I admire the most, thinking about how before BinaryEdge she had never written a single line of code to being the amazing data scientist she is today just makes me proud).</p>

<p>Marco was a dad and moved to the data science team as a data engineer to help with faster integration of our data. He was the best CTO one could have asked for and just want BinaryEdge needed.</p>

<p>This team is what made all of this possible, and I will forever be thankful to them for everything they did. They made my dream theirs, and I will forever be indebted to them for that. When the going gets tough, the tough get going, and this group was the reflection of that. There was no quitting on us.</p>

<h2 id="learnings">Learnings</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Opening a startup forces you to learn specific skills, fast, that otherwise you probably wouldn’t care about. Invoicing, accounting, planning, dealing with banks, customers, partnerships, etc…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After you go through it, a lot of things become more comfortable in life. To get to the point of where you’re feeling pressure or panic takes a lot more than it did before because while you’re running your startup, it will happen that you will go through those feelings, and you will have to figure out how to solve them or get out of those situations (often on your own!).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Going from being someone’s employer to employing people is a HUGE shift in your life. Having people you’re responsible for and salaries to pay or having investors who gave you money and that you need to show hope that they will get a return is a level of responsibility that I am not sure anything else in life can prepare you for. (Speaking on a phone with a customer that is &gt;10 days late with a payment while having to be polite is one of the hardest things you might ever do).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Working on something you founded makes it that the highs are just acceptable but the lows are really deep. Use the wins as small as they are to come out from low moments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Running a remote team is hard. Back then there weren’t really any founder resources on how to do it properly and we had to figure out a lot on our own.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The entrepreneur life is not as glamorous as a lot of the blogs, youtubers and others make it seem. It is hard, the grind to close customers and get paid is long (sometimes months long if you’re into enterprise software business) and you need to convince a bunch of strangers to join you on this crusade that is your vision as part of your team.</p>
  </li>
</ul>



<p>I’ve had a few people ask me what “comes next”, if I’m looking for investment for my next startup or just the general “Are you ever opening a startup again?”.</p>

<p>My focus is on growing and executing a vision that I get to have the honor of building and planning for, so what is next is Coalition.</p>

<p>I love my job, if you’ve interviewed with me lately you will have heard me say “I have the best job in the world” and the reason for that is that I still get to build <a href="https://asm.binaryedge.io/">amazing products</a> while working with a team that has more than doubled in size and that makes it an absolute pleasure to wake up each morning and get to work.</p>

<p>My team is everthing for me, all the cool stuff I get to …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

		<h2 id="003">0:03</h2>

<div><p>Welcome to Signals and Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky. </p><p>Today I’m going to have a conversation with Brian Nigito, essentially, about the technological underpinnings of the financial markets, and some of the ways in which those underpinnings differ from what you might expect if you’re used to things like the open Internet and the way in which cloud infrastructures work. We’re going to talk about a lot of things, but there’s going to be a lot of focus on networking, and some of the technologies at that level, including things like IP multicast. </p><p>Brian Nigito is a great person to have this conversation with because he has a deep and long history with the financial markets. He’s worked in the markets for 20 years, some of the time he spent working at the exchange-level where he did a lot of the foundational work that led to the modern exchange architectures that we know today. He’s also worked on the side of various different trading firms. For the last eight years, Brian’s been working here at Jane Street and his work here has covered a lot of different areas, but today, he spends a lot of time thinking about high performance, low latency, and especially network level stuff. </p><p>So let’s dive in. I think one thing that I’m very sensitive to is a lot of the people who are listening, don’t know a ton about the financial markets and how they work. And so just to get started, Brian can give a fairly basic explanation of what an exchange is.</p></div>

<h2 id="122">1:22</h2>

<p>I think when you hear about an exchange, you can think of lots of different kinds of marketplaces. But when we talk about an exchange, we’re talking about a formal securities exchange. And these are the exchanges that the SEC regulates, and they meet all of the rules necessary to allow people to trade in securities. So when we use that loosely, yeah, it’s pretty different than your average flea market. Supposed to be anyway.</p>

<h2 id="146">1:46</h2>

<p>That’s obviously a function which, once upon a time was done with physical people in the same location, right? Those got moved into more formal, more organized exchanges with more electronic support. Then eventually there’s this kind of transformation that’s happened essentially over the last 20 years, where the human element has changed enormous amount. Now, humans are obviously deeply involved in what’s going on, but the humans are almost all outside of the exchange and the exchange itself has become essentially a kind of purely electronic medium.</p>

<h2 id="217">2:17</h2>

<p>Yeah, it’s a really interesting story because you have examples of communication technologies and electronic trading, going back to the late ’60s, but probably more mid-‘70s (I’m being a little loose with dates) but it was kind of always present. But the rule set was not designed to force people to operate at the kinds of timescales that electronic systems would cause you to operate at. It was rather forgiving. So you know, if somebody on the floor didn’t want to deal with then electronic exchange, the electronic exchange had to wait. Over the past 10 to 15 years, that’s kind of flipped and so generally, we favor, always accessible electronic quotations.</p>

<h2 id="305">3:05</h2>

<p>To step back a little bit. The exchanges are the places for people to meet and trade, as you said, to advertise their prices. And for people to transact with each other. Other than people who are buying and selling, what are the other people who interact at the exchange level, what are the other kind of entities that get hooked in there.</p>

<h2 id="319">3:19</h2>

<p>So you have, obviously the entities who either in their own capacity or on behalf of other people are transacting securities, but then you have financial institutions that are clearing and guaranteeing those trades, providing some of the capital or leverage to the participants who are trading, they obviously want to know what’s going on there. You have other exchanges, because the rule set requires the exchanges to respect each other’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_quote">quotations</a> – in this odd way, there’s a web where the the exchanges are customers of each other. And you may also have various kinds of market data providers. So those quotes that reflect the activity on the exchange are eventually making their way all the way down to what you might see scrolling on the bottom of the television or your brokerage screen or financial news website, etc. I guess they even make it all the way down to the printed page when the Wall Street Journal prints transaction prices.</p>

<h2 id="410">4:10</h2>

<p>So what does this look like at a more systems level? What are the messages the different participants are sending back and forth?</p>

<h2 id="416">4:16</h2>

<div><p>The most primitive sorts of things are you have orders or instructions, there are other platforms where we have quotes and we may use that loosely, but we’ll just say orders. An order would just say that I would like to buy or sell, let’s say, a specific stock, and I’d like to do so at no worse than this price, and for no more than this quantity, and that may mean I could get filled at a slightly better price than that. I could get filled for less [quantity] than that. I could get filled not at all. </p><p>That order could basically check the book immediately and then come right back to me if there’s nothing to be done. Or it can rest there for some nonzero amount of time where it could advertise and other people may see it and choose to interact with it. And then obviously, I can withdraw that interest or cancel it. So when we talked about orders or cancels, those go hand in hand. </p><p>Finally, there’s execution messages where if you and I intersect on our interest I want to buy you want to sell or vice versa, then the exchange is going to generate an execution to you. And to me, saying that that happened and the terms of that trade.</p></div>

<h2 id="522">5:22</h2>

<div><p>One of the key properties here is that you have a fairly simple core set of messages, this basic data structure at the heart of it called “the book,” which is the set of orders that have not been satisfied. And then people can send messages to add orders and remove orders. And then if two orders <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cross.asp">cross</a>, if there are two orders that are compatible, where a trade can go up, then an execution occurs and the information flows out. </p><p>There’s a fairly simple core machine at the heart of it but then lots of different players who want different subsets of information for different purposes. There are people who are themselves trading, who want to see of course, their own activity and all the detail about that. And they also want to see what we call “market data,” that kind of public anonymized version of the trading activity so you can see what are the prices there are out there that are advertised for you to go and transact against. </p><p>In the end, you need to build a machine that’s capable of running this core engine, doing it at sufficient speed, doing it reliably enough… Maybe a thing that’s not apparent if you haven’t thought about it is: there’s like a disturbing dizzying amount of money at stake. And oh my God, you do not want to lose track of the transactions, right? If you say like, “Oh, you guys did this trade,” and then you forget about it and don’t report it, or you report to one side and not the other, terrible things happen. So reliability is a key thing.</p></div>

<h2 id="635">6:35</h2>

<p>Yeah and I think to go back, there’s lots of different consumers, lots of different participants. And I think the key word there is there’s lots of <em>competing</em> participants. So one thing you didn’t mention in there is disseminating all that information fairly. So trying to get it to everybody at the same time is a real challenge and one that participants are studying very, very carefully and looking for any advantage they can technologically within the rule set, etc. So that extra layer of competition sort of makes the problem a little more complicated, and a little more challenging.</p>

<h2 id="710">7:10</h2>

<p>This fairness issue is one that you’ve seen from the inside working on early exchange infrastructure at Island and Instinet, which eventually became the technology that NASDAQ is built on. Early on, you guys built an infrastructure that I think didn’t have all the fairness guarantees that modern exchanges happen today. Can you say more about how that actually plays out in practice?</p>

<h2 id="729">7:29</h2>

<div><p>When working on the Island system, it was very close, originally, to sort of “fair” in that you had the same physical machines, you had an underlying delivery mechanism, which we’ll talk about, that was very fair at getting it to those individual machines. And then you were sending copies of orders or instructions after going through one application to everyone. So you were all passing through about the exact same amount of work and the about the exact same number of devices. But it was actually very inefficient, we were using thousands of machines that were mostly idle. </p><p>So once we started trying to handle multiple clients on a single machine, it exposed some obvious and silly problems. The naive implementation where people would connect, we would collect all of those connections. And then when we had a message, we would send them on the connections serially, often in the order in which people connected. Well, that immediately led to thousands of messages per second before the exchange open where somebody tried to be the very first connection in that line. </p><p>Then you start sort of round-robining, so you know, you start from one and then the next time around, you start from two etc, etc, to try to randomize this. And then you had people who were connecting to as many different ports as they could and taking the fastest of each one. And so these incentives are very, very strong, and we’d like to use machines to their fullest, but to literally provide each participant their own unique machine for each connection starts to get ridiculous as well.</p></div>

<h2 id="904">9:04</h2>

<p>Where did that lead you? How did you end up resolving that problem?</p>

It promotes articles which use stunning visualizations to give the reader a more intuitive understanding of the topics. Spatial reasoning and imagination tends to work very well to understand topics in machine learning &amp; data science. This is not surprising, considering so much of the fundamental math behind the fields is linear algebra and calculus.

Besides being one of the most known deep learning researchers on earth, he is a font of creativity, creating widely used tools like <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/arxiv-sanity-preserver">arxiv sanity preserver</a> as side projects.</p><p>Countless people have entered the field via his <a href="http://cs231n.stanford.edu/">Stanford cs231n course</a>, and you would benefit from committing his <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/">neural network training recipe</a> to heart.</p><p>I also recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx7BXih7zx8">his talk about the real-life problems Tesla needs to overcome</a> when trying to apply machine learning at massive scale in the real world. It's impressive, informative and sobering.</p><p>Besides writing about ML directly, he also writes some <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/advice.html">good life advice</a> for <a href="https://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/">aspiring researchers</a>.</p><h2 id="uber-engineering"><a href="https://eng.uber.com/">Uber Engineering</a></h2><p>Uber's engineering blog is truly impressive in scope and breadth, covering a ton of topics, <a href="https://eng.uber.com/category/articles/ai/">AI in particular</a>.</p><p>What I particularly like about Uber's engineering culture, is their tendency to spin off <a href="https://eng.uber.com/category/articles/open-source-articles/">super interesting and valuable open source projects</a> at a head-spinning pace. Some examples are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/uber/ludwig">https://github.com/uber/ludwig</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/uber/h3">https://github.com/uber/h3</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/uber/react-vis">https://github.com/uber/react-vis</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/uber/aresdb">https://github.com/uber/aresdb</a></li><li>And the list goes on and on and on... Hats off, Uber 🎩</li></ul><h2 id="openai-blog"><a href="https://openai.com/blog/">OpenAI Blog</a></h2><p>Putting aside any controversy, the OpenAI blog is undeniably beautiful. From time to time, it posts content about deep learning insights which only OpenAI's massive scale can reach, such as the hypothesized <a href="https://openai.com/blog/deep-double-descent/">Deep Double Descent</a> phenomenon. They tend to post infrequent, high-impact pieces, so it's a high noise-to-signal ratio.</p><figure><img src="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2020/10/ddd_epoch_test.png" alt="Deep Double Descent, from OpenAI" srcset="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/ddd_epoch_test.png 600w, https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/ddd_epoch_test.png 1000w, https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/ddd_epoch_test.png 1600w, https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2020/10/ddd_epoch_test.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Source: https://openai.com/blog/deep-double-descent/</figcaption></figure><h2 id="taboola-blog"><a href="https://engineering.taboola.com/category/data-science/">Taboola Blog</a></h2><p>Not as well known as some of the other suggestions in this post, I find the Taboola blog to be unique - it deals with very down-to-earth, real-life problems when trying to use ML in production for "normal" businesses - less self driving cars and RL agents beating world champions, more "how do I know if my model is now predicting things with fake confidence?"</p><p>These problems are relevant for almost everyone working in the field, and they get less press coverage than the more sexy AI topics, but solving them correctly still requires world class talent. Thankfully, Taboola has both that talent AND the willingness and ability to write about it, so that others can learn as well.</p><h2 id="reddit">Reddit</h2><p>Alongside Twitter, there's nothing quite like Reddit to get caught up on papers, tools, and the wisdom of the crowds.</p><ul><li><a href="http://reddit.com/r/machinelearning/">reddit.com/r/machinelearning/</a></li><li><a href="http://reddit.com/r/machinelearning/">reddit.com/r/datascience/</a></li></ul><h2 id="state-of-ai"><a href="https://www.stateof.ai/">State of AI</a></h2><p>Published only annually, but contains very dense information content.</p><p>Relative to the other sources in this list, it's more accessible to (non-technical) business people.</p><p>What I like about the report, is it tries to give a more holistic view of where the industry and research is going at 10,000 feet - tying together advances in hardware, research, business, and even geopolitics.</p><p>Be sure to start by skipping to the end to read about the conflicts of interests :)</p><h2 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h2><p>To be frank, in my opinion podcasts are problematic for learning about technical topics. Most of them have a hard time explaining the things that need explaining using audio only, as data science is a very visual field.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><span>The core of a product manager's job is to make change happen by influencing stakeholders without exerting power over them. It is not an easy task. But it is much more approachable with the right tools. </span></p> <p><span>Here I have curated some powerful principles and practical tips from the field of psychology as well as experts trained in persuasion so that you can rally support behind your ideas. </span></p> <p><span>Persuasion is the focus of this post. Other topics such as building the right product and making robust decisions are out of scope (to be covered in future posts). </span></p> <p><span>It should go without saying, but use these techniques wisely. Always do what's right for the product and for your customers.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Facts Are Overrated</span></h3></p> <p><span>We like to think we are perfectly logical and rational beings. But we are not. Humans tend to make decisions based on (often hidden) biases and emotions. </span></p> <p><span>By all means, bring facts and data to the table wherever possible. But don't expect facts alone to change people's minds. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Reciprocation</span></h3></p> <p><span>We are hardwired to reciprocate favours. If you want a partner's cooperation tomorrow, do that person a favour today. But offer real value, not just as a means to get what you want.</span></p> <p><span>Another way in which reciprocation can work to your advantage is starting with a bigger (exaggerated) ask that is likely to get rejected. Then concede to a smaller request. It is more likely to work than when presented on its own.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Persuasion Still Works Even if the Person Recognizes the Technique</span></h3></p> <p><span>In a way, this is similar to optical or audio illusions. Even if you know certain psychological effects are at play, it is hard to resist. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>What you Think More About Becomes More Important</span></h3></p> <p><span>When you devote mental energy to an idea, you remember it better. In your mind, it becomes more important. For this reason, intentional "errors" in your message (such as a typo in your email) can make the message rise in importance, even as the errors attract criticism (which is a form of attention). </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Repetition is Persuasion</span></h3></p> <p><span>Repetition is persuasion.</span></p> <p><span>Repetition is persuasion.</span></p> <p><span>Repetition is persuasion.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Commitment and Consistency</span></h3></p> <p><span>The moment we make a decision, there is a tendency to justify the wisdom of our choice and find reasons to dismiss the other options. From this point, cognitive dissonance and confirmation bias are at play. </span></p> <p><span>Trivial requests increase the likelihood of compliance to larger requests. In the book Influence, Robert Cialdini noted that once a small commitment has been made, people tend to add justification to further commitments. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Visual Persuasion</span></h3></p> <p><span>All else being equal, visual persuasion is more powerful than non-visual persuasion. Humans are generally visual creatures. Using visual language and visual imagery is persuasive. What's more, if you can make someone imagine the scene, you don't even need a physical picture.</span></p> <p><span>Try using the whiteboard in a meeting and drawing out ideas as you go, or attaching simple illustrations in your emails/messages to convey your ideas.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Thinking Past the Sale</span></h3></p> <p><span>Related to the above points about visualization and the importance we tend to assign to what we think about more, getting your stakeholder to "imagine" a future where your proposal will have manifested is powerful. </span></p> <p><span>As they think about your proposed future more, they are more likely to see opportunities to make that future a reality. In persuasion writer Scott Adams' observations, people tend to gravitate to the future they are imagining most vividly, even if they don’t want that future.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Social Proof</span></h3></p> <p><span>If you already have buy-in from some other stakeholders, you are more likely to gain support for your idea. </span></p> <p><span>You know that restaurant in town that is popular </span> <em>because</em> <span> it is popular? Or the TV show that everyone is talking about </span> <em>because</em> <span> everyone is talking about it? Your feature idea can be like that too.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Don't Feel Their Pain. Label It.</span></h3></p> <p><span>We all like to be heard. When we talk to people who ignore us, resentment and frustration build up. We talk past each other. Conversations break down.</span></p> <p><span>Pay close attention to the subtle changes in people when they respond to your words. One way to validate and acknowledge the other person's feelings is by labeling. Give their emotion a name. Then lead with words such as "it seems like...", "it sounds like...", or "it looks like...". </span></p> <p><span>And once you have used a label, be quiet and listen. Give the person a chance to share and reveal.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>"That's Right"</span></h3></p> <p><span>According to FBI hostage negotiator Chris Voss, the sweetest two words in any negotiation are "that’s right." If you are arguing with your stakeholder, you want to lead the conversation to a "that's right". </span></p> <p><span>It is at the point that they feel heard and become ready to listen to what you have to say. They are signaling that they believe you understand their perspective. You are now on the same page. You are now ready to move the discussion forward.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Further Readings</span></h3></p>

<![CDATA[Many of the root certificates on Windows are not needed]]>

October 19, 2020 | https://hexatomium.github.io/2020/10/17/001.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://hexatomium.github.io/2020/10/17/001.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>As of today, Windows trusts 322 root certificates issued by 122 different organizations from 47 countries. This number is quite high, and has been steadily growing over the last few years. And it turns out many of those certificates are not needed at all by the vast majority of Windows users, can be distrusted with no ill effects of any sort.</p>

<p>Each of these CAs is given tremendous power over your Internet traffic, so it makes great sense to minimize the number of CAs your computer trusts. 
One simple way to achieve this goal is to replace the default Windows list of root CAs with the much stricter Mozilla trust list, which includes 142 roots (52 organizations - 21 countries). An even stricter option is using the Google CTL, which currently includes just 127 root certificates (48 organizations - 21 countries). For the vast majority of users, applying either set is a great way to reduce your exposure to unnecessary CAs, with no negative impact whatsoever.</p>

<p>Replacing the default Windows list of root CAs with the Mozilla or Google trust lists can be done manually, but is extremely time-consuming and error prone. 
The free version of RootIQ(*) offers a much simpler way to perform this system change:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1. Use the Quick select dropdown to select the Mozilla trust set
2. Right-click the selection and click Invert selection
3. Right-click the selection and click Distrust
   Click Yes on the confirmation dialog
   This will distrust all roots that are not part of the Mozilla trust set, except for any Microsoft OS-critical roots.
4. Use the Quick select dropdown to select the Mozilla trust set (again)

<p>Hi, I know it’s been a while.  I recently had to nuke and re-pave my personal laptop and I thought it would be a nice thing to share with the community how I set up OpenBSD on it so that I have a useful, modern, secure environment for getting work done.  I’m not going to say I’m the expert on this or that this is the BEST way to set up OpenBSD, but I thought it would be worthwhile for folks doing Google searches to at least get my opinion on this.  So, given that, let’s go…</p>



<p>After downloading the install67.fs image from my favorite site (<a href="https://openbsd.cs.toronto.edu/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64">https://openbsd.cs.toronto.edu/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64</a>) I write it to a USB drive on Linux with:</p>



<p>$ sudo dd if=install67.fs of=/dev/sdc bs=1M</p>



<p>I then boot off of that USB drive and drop to a (s)hell at the install prompt.  From there, I create the full disk encryption container for my install:</p>



<p># cd /dev<br># chmod +x ./MAKEDEV<br># ./MAKEDEV sd1<br># fdisk -iy sd1<br># disklabel -E sd1</p>



<p>Create one big “a” partition for the whole drive but specify RAID as the partition type.</p>



<p># bioctl -c C -l /dev/sd1a softraid0</p>



<p>I then enter my decryption password and type ‘exit’ to restart the installation.  The only tweak I make to the installer is to set up my wifi (it won’t work in the installer or on reboot for me because I have an Intel ‘iwm’ device that needs the firmware installed – I do that later) and make sure that my /usr partition is at least 200g in size (I probably should but I don’t create the subdirectory mount points, just one big /usr).</p>



<p>After the first reboot, I go back to my Linux box with the same USB drive, turn it into a single partition FAT32 drive and download the firmware for my Intel ‘iwm’ device from <a href="https://firmware.openbsd.org/firmware/6.7">https://firmware.openbsd.org/firmware/6.7</a> as a single .tgz file that I place on that USB drive.  I then mount the drive on OpenBSD:</p>



<p># mount /dev/sd2i /mnt</p>



<p>Next, I copy the .tgz file to the /etc directory and expand it there.  It will automatically put the right files in the /etc/firmware directory.  I then reboot and should have WiFi.  I then update the other firmware:</p>



<p># fw_update</p>



<p>Next, I run syspatch to ensure that I’m fully patched on the kernel and userland I’m running:</p>



<p># syspatch</p>



<p>That takes a bit of time, just be patient.  At this point, it’s best to reboot because so much has changed on the disk from what is running in memory.  You should see in the dmesg output that all of your firmware installed successfully and that the kernel relinked to help fight off potential ROP attackers.</p>



<p>First things first, I create an /etc/doas.conf file so that I can run everything in my regular user account:</p>



<p># echo “permit persist keepenv MY_USERNAME as root” &gt; /etc/doas.conf</p>



<p>Next, I set up power management (because I’m running on a laptop):</p>



<p># rcctl enable apmd<br># rccl set apmd flags -A<br># rcctl start apmd</p>



<p>Since I run development tools and the owncloud desktop, I have to tweak some values in /etc/login.conf to make things work the way I want them to.  First, I add myself to the “staff” group:</p>



<p># usermod -G staff MY_USERNAME</p>



<p>I then edit /etc/login.conf in the “staff” section to make the following changes:</p>



<p># pkg_add vim<br># vim /etc/login.conf</p>



<p>…<br>staff:\<br>    :datasize-cur=4096M:\<br>    :datasize-max=infinity:\<br>    :maxproc-max=512:\<br>    :maxproc-cur=256:\<br>    :openfiles-max=102400:\<br>    :openfiles-cur=102400</p>



<p>I also modify /etc/sysctl.conf to include the line:</p>



<p>kern.maxfiles=102400</p>



<p>I then will typically reboot to pick up the changes.</p>



<p>Next, I want to install the Gnome desktop environment and the Gnome display manager.  It’s what I’m most comfortable in and I know it’s a pain in the you know what for the port maintainers to keep it working on OpenBSD because of the Linux-ism’s that keep creeping in so I want to put in a shout out to them for all of their hard work on this.</p>



<p># pkg_add gnome gnome-tweaks gnome-extras<br># rcctl disable xenodm<br># rcctl enable multicast messagebus avahi_daemon gdm</p>



<p>Install my favorite applications and utilities:</p>



<p># pkg_add firefox chromium libreoffice owncloudclient<br># pkg_add keepassxc aisleriot evolution evolution-ews<br># pkg_add tor-browser shotwell gimp</p>



<p>I will reboot at this point and go into Gnome with the default theme.  That needs fixing so I download the yaru-remix-complete theme from <a href="https://www.gnome-look.org/">https://www.gnome-look.org</a> and install it manually by doing the following:</p>



<p>$ cd ~<br>$ mkdir .themes<br>$ cd .themes<br>$ mv ~/Downloads/Yaru-remix-complete.tar.xz .<br>$ unxz Yaru-remix-complete.tar.xz<br>$ tar xf Yaru-remix-complete.tar<br>$ mv themes/* .<br>$ rmdir themes<br>$ doas mv icons/* /usr/local/share/icons<br>$ rmdir icons<br>$ doas mv wallpaper/* /usr/local/share/backgrounds/gnome<br>$ rmdir wallpaper<br>$ rm Yaru-remix-complete.tar</p>



<p>Fire up gnome-tweaks and from “Extensions” turn on “user-themes”.  Close and restart gnome-tweaks, go to the “Appearance” tab and select “Yaru-remix-dark” for “Applications”, “Icons” and “Shell”.  ON “Top Bar”, turn on “Battery Percentage” and “Weekday”.  In “Window Titlebars” enable “Maximize” and “Minimize”.</p>



<p>Enable the extension “Dash to Dock” by downloading it from <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/">https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/</a> and pick the right shell version and extension version to match your install of Gnome shell.  You will have to manually install it because the Gnome shell extension integration doesn’t appear to be enabled for OpenBSD:</p>



<p>$ cd ~/Downloads<br>$ unzip dash-to-docmicxgx.gmail.com.v67.shell-extension.zip<br>$ cat metadata.json</p>



<p>The value for “uuid” is what you want to use next:</p>



<p>$ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/dash-to-dock@micxgx.gmail.com<br>$ cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/dash-to-dock@micxgx.gmail.com<br>$ unzip ~/Downloads/dash-to-docmicxgx.gmail.com.v67.shell-extension.zip</p>



<p>Reboot to restart Gnome shell, log in, start gnome-tweaks, navigate to the “Extensions” tab and enable dash to dock.  From the settings gear icon, select “extend to edge…” and you should have a very serviceable dock that is quite similar to Ubuntu 20.04’s.</p>



<p>Finally, switch the terminal to “Green on Black” for a better look in the terminal.  Pin your favorite apps to the dock and you should be good to go.</p>

<![CDATA[A case for using punctuation in Slack]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <section>
          <p><strong>You should use punctuation in Slack.</strong> You should also use complete sentences and proper grammar. You should expand acronyms<sup>[1]</sup> and — when communicating emotion — even mix in some emoji for effect. You should do that not just in Slack, but in all of your professional communication.</p>

<hr>

<p>Written communication is hard, but in the digital world we work in it’s also vital. Sadly, the style of communication that services like Slack incentivize is awful.</p>

<p>To voice an opinion before the conversation moves on, you type fast and use abbreviations and hit send even with misspellings. You think one message at a time. You bounce between different threads and become easily distracted.</p>

<p>There are some obvious downsides to this fast and loose style. Most notably, it interrupts more productive work and deters deep thinking. But one large and often overlooked downside is the impact it has on others.</p>

<h2 id="externalities">Externalities</h2>

<p>When you use an obscure initialism or take shortcuts on grammar and spelling, it may save you a couple seconds. The problem is those small savings are often outweighed by the cost born by your audience.</p>

<p>Every person who reads your message spends some finite period of time interpreting what you’re saying. Setting aside the possibility that a sloppy message might lead the reader to an incorrect interpretation, it’s harder to parse messages written hastily — messages with poor grammar, misspellings, minimal punctuation, obscure acronyms, or delivered a few words at a time.</p>

<p>As an example, assume you send the following message to a Slack channel with 10 other people in it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>anyone know the latest on cai
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And further assume that “cai” refers to an internal project: <strong>C</strong>rusade <strong>A</strong>gainst <strong>I</strong>nitialisms. By writing in all lower case, using an initialism to refer to the project, and omitting the question mark, you’ve saved yourself two words and a handful of extra keystrokes. Under the most generous assumptions, say that translates to five seconds in savings. That’s a lot!</p>

<p>But let’s now examine the impact the shortcuts have on your 10-person audience.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two people thought “cai” was a typo and spent several moments trying to guess what you actually meant to type before realizing you were referring to the internal project. <em>Cost: 20 seconds</em></li>
  <li>Two people didn’t know what “cai” stood for. One spent three minutes tracking it down on the internal wiki, and the other sent a private message to another team member to ask. <em>Cost: 4 minutes</em></li>
  <li>One person ignored your ask because they didn’t realize it was a question when scanning the channel. <em>Cost: Priceless</em></li>
  <li>Five people understood what you meant but still had to mentally expand the initialism before internalizing your ask. <em>Cost: 5 seconds</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Your 5 seconds of savings amounted to roughly 4.5 <em>minutes</em> of cost spread across your audience. Sure, this is a contrived example and sure there are cases where the cost is lower, but the point stands: <strong>your communication shortcuts are costly</strong>.</p>

<p>In economics, this phenomena is referred to as a negative externality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A negative externality is the cost that affects a third party who did not choose to incur that cost.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every time you take a communication shortcut, you are inflicting a micro-externality on your audience. The more egregious the shortcut, the larger the externality; the larger your audience, the more times the externality is multiplied and the larger the overall cost.</p>

<h2 id="so-what">So what?</h2>

<p>If you’re communicating with a close friend and choose to use shorthand, you’re probably fine. Not only will your friend probably be accustomed to it (i.e. the externality will be small), but the audience is also small (i.e. the total cost will be small). In this case, it’s entirely possible your shorthand saves you more time than it costs your friend.</p>

<p>However, when you’re communicating in a one-to-many setting such as email or Slack, and particularly in a professional setting, sloppy writing<sup>[2]</sup> has real consequences. It prioritizes your time above the time of <em>every other person</em> that will be reading that message and might misinterpret your intent or tone. In aggregate, it is a net drain on productivity at your company.</p>

<p>So use proper spelling and grammar. Write out your entire thought before hitting send. Expand acronyms. Use punctuation.</p>

<p>A period, even at the end of “Do it,” communicates, “I’ve said everything I wanted to say.”</p>

<hr>

<p>[1] For the sticklers out there, this includes initialisms as well as acronyms.</p>
<p>[2] The term "sloppy" might sound harsh, but I chose it deliberately. Not everyone speaks the company language (e.g. English) natively, and for them using proper spelling or grammar might be challenging to say the least. The argument here is scoped to people who have some degree of mastery over the language but are being <em>sloppy</em> with their written communication, which is to say "careless and unsystematic; excessively casual".</p>

October 19, 2020 | https://stefan-marr.de/2020/10/irrationally-annoyed/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://stefan-marr.de/2020/10/irrationally-annoyed/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>I started writing this post when being very very annoyed by <a href="https://blog.sigplan.org/2020/10/12/from-heavy-metal-to-irrational-exuberance/">this blog post</a> on the SIGPLAN blog.
I could not understand how “THE SIGPLAN” blog
could simply write 30 years of
programming language research out of existence,
only barely acknowledging Self and JavaScript.
It felt like <a href="https://xkcd.com/386/">duty called</a>…</p>

<p>Though, after multiple rounds of edits,
I am now assuming that there’s simply an issue of awareness.
What follows is therefore an attempt to raise awareness on the various
academic but also industrial efforts around the performance of dynamic languages.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: this blog post isn’t attempting to be complete in any way,
but I hope it provides enough pointers for people interested in
<em>language implementation technology for dynamic languages</em>
to go deeper and possibly even contribute.</p>

<h2 id="languages-vs-language-implementations">Languages vs. Language Implementations</h2>

<p>Before going into technical details,
it is important to start distinguishing between
a language and its implementation.
Especially, when we talk about programming language research,
these two are rarely the same.</p>

<p>While the languages mentioned in the post (Python, R, PHP) all have
“standard” implementations, which are the by far most widely used ones,
they are far from the only implementations.
Let’s just pick three for each language:
There are PyPy, IronPython, and Jython for Python,
pqR, Renjin, and FastR for R,
as well as HippyVM, PeachPie, and Quercus for PHP.</p>

<p>They all have benefits and drawbacks. And perhaps are not even 100% compatible,
but various groups of people clearly spent a lot of time and energy on
more optimized language implementations. Some of these implementations have
state-of-the-art just-in-time compilers and can reach performance competitive
with JavaScript, which itself is certainly competitive with for instance Java,
and only slightly behind “metal” languages in some, and ahead in other benchmarks.</p>

<p>How do I know? I didn’t benchmark all of these language implementations,
but I worked on comparing compilers across languages with the <a href="https://github.com/smarr/are-we-fast-yet/">Are We Fast Yet project</a> [<a href="https://stefan-marr.de/downloads/dls16-marr-et-al-cross-language-compiler-benchmarking-are-we-fast-yet.pdf">5</a>].
One important insight here is that language design can definitely have
a performance impact. But, the ingenuity of compiler writers
and language implementers has eliminated all major performance hurdles
in the last 30 years.</p>

<p>This means, claims about the <em>languages</em> for instance them
being “all notoriously slow and bloated” and “not designed to be fast or space-efficient”
are rather misguided.</p>

<p>Just-in-time compilation technology as used for JavaScript, Java, Python
and others is very effective, and not particularly language-specific.
Some of the key techniques have been known
for 30 years, <a href="https://stefan-marr.de/2020/08/optimizing-the-unoptimizable-using-old-ideas/">as I discussed elsewhere</a>.
Others, such as <a href="https://tratt.net/laurie/research/pubs/html/bolz_diekmann_tratt__storage_strategies_for_collections_in_dynamically_typed_languages/">storage strategies</a>, <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43823/">mementos</a>,
and <a href="http://www.ssw.uni-linz.ac.at/Research/Papers/Stadler14/Stadler2014-CGO-PEA.pdf">partial escape analysis</a> are much more recent and help with many issues.
Perhaps interesting to note is that storage strategies were actually
first done in PyPy, and are now pretty much standard in just-in-time compiling
VMs for a whole range of languages, including JavaScript.</p>

<p>Though, one may argue that these techniques have not been successful enough,
because people don’t use the language implementations actually benefiting from
them.</p>

<p>Fine, but I believe this is only partially a technical problem.
Some of it is a social issue, too.</p>

<p>Others have spent time on identifying potential reasons
of why people do not pick up our research. For instance, Laurie wrote blog posts
on why not more users are happy with our VMs [<a href="https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/entries/why_arent_more_users_more_happy_with_our_vms_part_1.html">1</a>, <a href="https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/entries/why_arent_more_users_more_happy_with_our_vms_part_2.html">2</a>].</p>

<p>Given the claim that JavaScript is somehow exceptional,
I would argue that JavaScript was lucky in a way.
JavaScript was hilariously slow to start with.
For V8 this meant that they didn’t have to worry about making “startup performance”
worse. Their baseline native code compiler
produced code that was much better than the JavaScript interpreters
back then. Perhaps unfortunately, Python has a surprisingly fast interpreter,
which gives VMs such as PyPy quite a challenge.
Still, it is not impossible to beat such interpreters and have
just-in-time compiling VMs that have also good startup performance.
Examples are indeed modern JavaScript VMs, but also much smaller
and less well funded projects such as <a href="https://luajit.org/">LuaJIT</a>,
which has an incredibly fast interpreter and a very effective just-in-time compiler.
But indeed, it takes time and effort to build these systems,
which contrary to the claims in the blog post,
are indeed invested in these languages.</p>

<h2 id="is-python-doomed-of-course-not">Is Python doomed? Of course not!</h2>

<p>So, what about Python then?
The blog post picks up a claim that Python is incredibly slow when it comes
to matrix multiplication. And later, without much context claims that PyPy
is perhaps 2 times faster than Python, but sometimes slower.</p>

<p>One could have asked the PyPy community,
or looked at <a href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2018/06/repeating-matrix-multiplication.html">their blog</a>. PyPy doesn’t have auto-vectorization as far as I know,
so, indeed, it has a hard time reaching the performance of vectorized code,
but it is much faster than what’s implied.
Such broad claims are not just unjustified and bad style,
they are also painfully unscientific.
No, Python is not necessarily slow and bloated.
<a href="https://bibliography.selflanguage.org/_static/implementation.pdf">Maps</a>,
<a href="http://blogoscoped.com/google-chrome/14">Hidden Classes</a>,
and <a href="https://chrisseaton.com/rubytruffle/pppj14-om/pppj14-om.pdf">object shapes</a>
make it possible to store even integers rather efficiently.
With the previously mentioned
<a href="https://tratt.net/laurie/research/pubs/html/bolz_diekmann_tratt__storage_strategies_for_collections_in_dynamically_typed_languages/">storage strategies</a>,
this works extremely well for your hugh array with integers, too.</p>

<p>Now, perhaps more important is the questions whether auto-vectorization is something
dynamic languages simply can’t support.
Again, there’s no fundamental reason why VMs for dynamic languages can’t support it.
The <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/graalvm/">GraalVM</a> supports auto-vectorization
and can speedup JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and other dynamic languages with it.
Key techniques are speculative compilation, type feedback, object shapes, and
storage strategies.
With them, optimistic compilers can vectorize even
the code of dynamic languages.
For good measures, I should probably also mention <a href="https://jjfumero.github.io/publications/">Juan Fumero’s work</a> around using just-in-time compilation for dynamic languages to target GPUs.</p>

<h2 id="are-dynamic-languages-single-threaded">Are Dynamic-Languages Single Threaded?</h2>

<p>This one, I do indeed take personally.</p>

<p>First of all, being effectively single threaded can be a Good Thing™.
Why would you want to deal with shared memory race conditions?
This is a language design question. So in the end a matter of taste.
And, if one really wants to, <a href="http://stefan-marr.de/downloads/comlan-de-koster-et-al-domains-sharing-state-in-the-communicating-event-loop-actor-model.pdf">some forms of shared memory are possible,
even without introducing all its drawbacks</a>.</p>

<p>That aside, Python, R, and others have fairly nice ways of supporting parallelism, including multiprocess approaches.
And, to blow my own horn a little more, if you really want shared memory multithreading, you can have that efficiently, too with our work on thread-safe object models [<a href="https://stefan-marr.de/downloads/oopsla16-daloze-et-al-efficient-and-thread-safe-objects-for-dynamically-typed-languages.pdf">3</a>] and thread-safe storage strategies [<a href="https://stefan-marr.de/downloads/oopsla18-daloze-et-al-parallelization-of-dynamic-languages-synchronizing-built-in-collections.pdf">4</a>] .</p>

<h2 id="where-to-go-from-here">Where to go from here?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>To sum up: yes, metal languages will continue to be important, but so will the irrational exuberance languages. We as a community should lead the way in developing systems (at the hardware and software levels) that will make them run faster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, we should. And the PL community spent a lot of effort doing this for the last 30 years.
So, please join us. We are out there and could use help!</p>

<p><a href="https://mplr2020.cs.manchester.ac.uk/index.php/mplr/program">MPLR</a> has a keynote coming up titled “Hardware Support for Managed Languages: An Old Idea Whose Time Has Finally Come?”.

<p>And of course, SPLASH is around the corner, too.
With <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/dls-2020">DLS</a> and <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/home/vmil-2020">VMIL</a>, SPLASH has a strong history of providing venues for discussing
the implementation of dynamic languages.
OOPSLA, as in the past, has pretty cool papers on <a href="http://janvitek.org/pubs/oopsla20-j.pdf">dynamic</a> <a href="https://www.o1o.ch/about/assets/cd.pdf">language</a> <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/details/splash-2020-oopsla/50/Hidden-Inheritance-An-Inline-Caching-Design-for-TypeScript-Performance">implementation</a>.</p>

<p>Other relevant venues include for instance <a href="https://2019.ecoop.org/series/ICOOOLPS">ICOOOLPS</a> and <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/series/MoreVMs">MoreVMs</a>.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://stefan-marr.de/2020/06/efficient-and-safe-implementations-of-dynamic-languages/">Introduction to Efficient and Safe Implementations of Dynamic Languages</a> has many pointers
to research, some of which also made it into <a href="https://stefan-marr.de/tmp/bibtex.html">some early overview of the field</a>.</p>

<h2 id="post-scriptum">Post Scriptum</h2>

<p>Part of my annoyance with the blog post is its dismissive and condescending tone.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some of these so-called “scripting languages” are essentially moribund, like Perl (1987)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems a completely unnecessary point to be made.
It is also unclear how this is assessed. The Perl community is active,
but yes, a lot of effort went into
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2019/08/is-perl-6-being-renamed.html">Raku</a>.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, it describes “JavaScript is an outlier”, refers to the
“monoculture [of] (the browser)”, and says there’s “no need for compatibility with legacy code”.
JavaScript is certainly an interesting special case,
and indeed, as acknowledged, browsers just happen to have attracted a lot of funding.
But a monoculture? In which sense? At least in the past,
“the browser” itself was rather diverse. When it comes to backwards compatibility,
the number one design goal of Ecma TC39, the group designing JavaScript,
is “don’t break the web”.</p>

<p>And of course, browsers themselves are incredibly complex “legacy systems”.
To get a taste, I’d recommend to listen to <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/details/dls-2019/dls-2019/1/Untangling-the-web-Memory-management-in-Chrome-s-web-platform-implementation">Michael Lippautz</a>
talking about how C++ and JavaScript interact.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Python programmers need to distinguish between time and memory spent in pure Python (optimizable) from time and memory spent in C libraries (not so much). They need help tracking down expensive and insidious traffic across the language boundaries (copying and serialization).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3201898">We could also try to get rid of it instead.</a>
Or give more power to people like <a href="https://kar.kent.ac.uk/76576/">Stephen Kell</a>,
and avoid copying/serialization in a different way.</p>

Kubernetes that! Do you even deploy clusters?"</p><p>So what does Kubernetes actually mean and how should your engineering team be using it in your day-to-day software development job?*</p><p>*<em>Spoiler Alert: <strong><strong>You</strong></strong> might not directly interface with k8s, but your DevOps team probably is, or at least they should be thinking about it if you are not a fan of the 3pm War Room deployment every Monday.</em></p><p>First, Kubernetes is a very unique word. Where does it come from, you might be asking. Often mispronounced, the real backstory of what Kubernetes means starts with a translation. The name originates from Greek, meaning helmsman (you can see that referenced in the logo) or pilot. Google Translate gives the <a href="https://translate.google.com/#view=home&amp;op=translate&amp;sl=el&amp;tl=en&amp;text=%CE%BA%CF%85%CE%B2%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%AE%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82">modern Greek pronunciation</a>, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/j6dv9u/well_this_explains_everything/g7zufar/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">Reddit explains the common pronunciation</a> as more similar to ancient Greek. Either way, Flavor Flav puts his own spin on it <a href="https://youtu.be/QxvmO-QlxJQ?t=27">here</a>.</p><p>Okay, now on to the technical stuff. First, let's define Kubernetes.</p><blockquote><strong>Kubernetes</strong> is a DevOps software development tool built and supported by Google to enable teams to simplify the management of deploying updates and services in a distributed system.</blockquote><p>Phew, that is a lot of techie words, but to simplify that: Gone are the days for having to have one giant compute machine on Amazon to support all your running containers. (Or worse, multiple identical giant compute machines holding everything imaginable because you needed more services that help user John_63_xyz to see his dashboard and upload his profile photo... okay, you get the point.)</p><p>Next, containers. A container is a standardized unit of software. If you are hung-up on what containers are, I strongly encourage you to give <a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container">this article</a> by Docker a read and then come back. You can also peek the graphic below.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/10/container-what-is-container.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>The advantages of running containerized code are innumerable and it is well established as an industry best practice, but in short: <strong>Containerization</strong> allows developers to create and deploy applications faster and more securely than before.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/10/container_evolution.svg"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>With traditional methods, code is developed into a specific computing environment that when transferred to a new location often results in bugs and errors.</p><p>Containerization also reduces wasted resources because each container only holds the application and related binaries or libraries. Simply by allowing more containers in the environment without the need for more servers, containerization increases scalability up to 100 times that of traditional VM environments.</p><p>Getting back to Kubernetes and what it is, it is a tool used for container orchestration. Meaning that it is one point of reference that you can "talk to" to access ANY of the services that you have running on your Kubernetes cluster. Even if those services are across different machines. Pretty great, yeah?</p><h2 id="so-what-does-kubernetes-do-exactly"><strong>So What Does Kubernetes Do Exactly?</strong></h2><p>EVERYTHING... for deployment and maintenance needs. Historically (not speaking ftp), the deployment process looked something like this:</p><ol><li>Code review is approved and changes are merged into master</li><li>ssh into your Amazon EC2 instance holding the git repo for your application</li><li>cd into your project directory</li><li>^C to stop application</li><li>git pull origin master</li><li>&lt;application start command&gt;</li><li>Hope it works out 🤞</li></ol><p>Over the years, the process has improved with Docker and docker-compose to run images of the application in containers instead of the application on bare metal, but it still follows the same steps as above.</p><p>Alternatively, if using Kubernetes, you can run <code>kubectl apply -f {deployment yaml}</code> to directly target ALL services on ALL machines of the specified type in your deployment yaml file and apply the new image(s) from your local machine (depending on the privileges you setup for the connection to your cluster).</p><p>On top of it being one line, it applies the update in a rollout fashion, meaning that it shuts down the services one at a time as it applies the new changes.</p><h3 id="what-if-i-need-to-add-new-services-not-defined-in-the-cluster"><strong>W<strong><strong>hat </strong></strong>i<strong><strong>f I </strong></strong>N<strong><strong>eed to </strong></strong>A<strong><strong>dd </strong></strong>N<strong><strong>ew </strong></strong>S<strong><strong>ervices </strong></strong>N<strong><strong>ot </strong></strong>D<strong><strong>efined in </strong></strong>the<strong><strong> </strong></strong>C<strong><strong>luster?</strong></strong></strong></h3><p>Simple, create a new deployment yaml file for the new service and run the apply command.</p><h3 id="what-if-i-need-more-than-one-of-the-same-service">What if I Need More Than One of the Same Service?</h3><p>Even easier, each service (called a deployment) has a number of pods representing the number of "service instances" that are running that application. Just set that value to be greater than 1, or even better set the "autoscaling" limit to be the maximum number of service instances you want running at a time and let Kubernetes scale the number of instances up and down based on traffic.</p><h3 id="is-there-a-limit-on-the-number-of-services-that-i-can-run">Is There a Limit on the Number of Services That I Can Run?</h3><p>Yes and no. Your Kubernetes cluster manages which machines (called nodes) the new pods get deployed to (and yes you can pair up applications that need to be together), which isn't a problem until there isn't enough space on any of the nodes you have allocated to your cluster. You can correct this by adding more nodes, so the sky and your wallet are the limit.</p><h2 id="how-do-i-setup-a-kubernetes-cluster-for-my-application">How Do I Setup a Kubernetes Cluster for My Application?</h2><p>There are a number of ways for setting up a Kubernetes cluster for your application ranging from bare metal to managed cloud provider solutions. In this article I'm going to point you in the right direction for setting up a managed solution in each of the major cloud providers as well as how to use The Ops Platform to make your life simpler, observable, and streamlined like a <a href="https://cto.ai/blog/slack-control-plane-for-devops-workflows/">Control Plane</a>.</p><h3 id="amazon-web-services-aws-eks"><strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS) EKS</strong></h3><p>According to AWS's <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started.html">documentation</a>, there are 2 ways to create a new EKS managed Kubernetes cluster. The first being an officially supported CLI developed by Weaveworks called <code>eksctl</code>. With eksctl, you can spin up a new managed cluster with reasonable defaults just by running <code>eksctl create cluster</code>.</p><p>Pretty easy right? You can also customize the settings on the cluster via the command line or a configuration yaml if you know what you are doing, which adds some complexity. From their <a href="https://eksctl.io/">website</a> it looks like this tool does the heavy lifting from the setup side, but doesn't provide any abstractions over <code>kubectl</code> for pod or deployment maintenance.</p><!--kg-card-begin: code--><pre><code>$ eksctl create cluster

<p>Each of these creators was prolific. And each produced some incredibly high-quality work. In creative fields, quality and quantity are <em>not</em> mutually exclusive.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In <a href="https://www.animalz.co/blog/content-marketing-strategy/">B2B content strategy</a>, we've all come to accept that we need to "slow down" and focus on quality. Because quantity, the thinking goes, had its moment already. After all, it wasn't so long ago that platforms like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn rewarded content creators who churned out tons of content. Content teams cranked out as much as they could. But it became a race to the bottom and before long, social networks decided giving away free traffic was bad for business.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Content marketers, by and large, moved their focus to a more established and reliable distribution channel. Someplace where quality can thrive and traffic comes in slowly and predictably over time: <strong>organic search</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite Google's imperfections, most writers I know are far happier writing for search than social. Pieces are worked on for a week or a month instead of an afternoon. Clickbait headlines are passed over in favor of depth and comprehension.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But what if we all overcorrected? What if prolific writing actually does work? What if quality or quantity isn't a one-or-the other decision? Could content teams benefit from upping their output?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote {"className":"is-style-default"} -->
<blockquote><p>For about six months in 2015, I was the world's most productive content marketer.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wrote, edited, and published one article per day. These weren't light pieces either. They were heavily-researched deep dives, anywhere from 800 to 3,500 words. Four years later, many of them still rank on the first page of search results for competitive terms like "creative juices", "asynchronous communication," and "tools to start a business."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>An article in the New Yorker recently <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/was-e-mail-a-mistake" target="_blank">linked to one</a> of these pieces. My first week on the job I was interviewed on a national radio show about one of them. Our approach worked and before long, the <a href="https://idonethis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="iDoneThis (opens in a new tab)">iDoneThis</a> site grew to 400,000 monthly pageviews. This strategy isn't for everyone, but it can work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One piece per day. Here's how I did it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Structure Your Day to Enable Creative Work</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“In effect I had two workdays each day, one on the manager's schedule and one on the maker's.”—Paul Graham.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I must have read Paul Graham’s famous “<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s Schedule</a>” piece, where he suggests structuring a day into two blocks of time. One block is for focused creative work, the “maker” side, the other is for the “manager” part of your role like meetings and email.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I could never have made this work without the maker/manager approach. Writing just requires so much focus and momentum. It’s like pushing a flywheel. It’s hard to get it started, but once it’s spinning it’s hard to stop. You’re best off starting and stopping only once per day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here was what my daily schedule looked like:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>7:30-8am:</strong> This was a quick skim of email and Slack. I’m talking 15-20 minutes of sitting with a cup of coffee and making sure nothing set on fire overnight or needed my immediate attention. I’m not trying to clear out inboxes yet, just hoping to let the caffeine kick in and give myself some assurance that I can safely slide into maker mode for the next few hours.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>8am-12pm:</strong> The first half of the day was full-on writing mode. Saying you can start and finish anything in just half a day sounds ambitious. And it is when that time’s full of distractions and email. But think about four uninterrupted hours. That’s a lot of time. What’s the last thing you totally focused on for four hours?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I intentionally structured maker time so it would end at lunch. Lunch is a nice finish line and dividing point for the day. It helps to have a few minutes to reset yourself before switching to manager mode. I’d get away from my desk, stretch out, take a walk, have something to eat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other bonus of putting writing time before lunch was that I could always delay lunch and buy myself an extra 60 or 90 minutes of writing time if I needed it. I didn’t quit until I had a draft written, read, read, read again, edited, read again, and in a place where I was confident publishing. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>12-12:30pm:</strong> Like I said, lunch. Also, get outside, walk the dog, meet a friend for coffee. Reset my thoughts. This was a fully remote team, so getting some sunshine and seeing other humans was super important.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1-5:30pm: </strong>Manager time. Even though the top line in my job description would have been “write blog posts,” there was a lot of work that wasn’t writing which I needed to make time for. Like running our email program, promoting the content, tracking performance, 1:1s with my manager, answering email and Slack, uploading and scheduling content into WordPress. I was also the only person in a marketing role in this startup, so you naturally wind up wearing a lot of hats.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Manager time typically didn’t take 4.5 hours, thankfully. And there was one more, really key activity during this time that I’ll get to in the next section.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Set Strict Rules for Your “Maker” Time</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were two things I really didn’t want to happen during writing time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The <strong>first</strong> was that I would sit down in the morning without knowing what I’d be working on, and waste my maker time trying to figure that out.</li><li>The <strong>second</strong> was that I’d start working on a piece, spend half a day on it, realize I didn’t have a strong enough idea and have to scrap it entirely. A lot of pieces sound good as a pitch, but fall apart once you try actually writing it. I didn’t want this to happen.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To keep both these fears at bay, I developed a strict “validated topics only” rule. That extra time during manager block that I mentioned? Researching and validating. This was for finding research, brainstorming, combing thought ideas and topics, finding the ones with potential and doing enough initial legwork to know the piece would actually hold up. Any extra time after regular manager activities was used for this.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To keep my system working, I always made sure to <strong>over-communicate the process.</strong> This was a remote team, and a small team, so I had some built-in protection against interruptions. But I still found it helpful to over-communicate my process. I’d talk about the system multiple times with managers and colleagues. I’d set my Slack status to something like “focusing on writing until noon,” I’d block my calendar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re going to try this, you’ve got to commit, and you’ve got to over-communicate. It simply won't work without large chunks of time every single day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Create a Workflow to Support Your Strategy</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like I said, validating before writing was a huge part of making this work. Most content teams have some workflow that goes like this: Ideas, Writing, Editing, Published. I think there’s a missing step between ideas and writing, and that’s <em>validating</em>. Maybe it’s my newspaper background, because when I was a reporter I could never just grab an idea and start writing. I’d have to validate that idea with my editor. Often they would even need to validate it with the other editors in a morning planning meeting before giving me the green light.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m a big fan of Trello for managing content workflows. My Trello columns looked like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Ideas</li><li>Validating</li><li>Validated</li><li>Writing and editing</li><li>Ready for Wordpress</li><li>Scheduled in Wordpress</li><li>Published</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ll just talk about the first three steps, since they are the most important. Why’s that? In any production system, flaws become more costly the further they move down the line. So it’s always more important, and cheaper, to catch errors as early in the production process as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Ideas:</strong> The first column—"Ideas"—was wide open. I’m a proponent of big backlogs and a “no bad ideas” approach. Every idea, even ones you think are bad or half-baked, go on there. A year from now that bad idea might weave together with two new ideas and turn into something great. Large backlogs are a secret weapon for a content program. </li><li><strong>Validating:</strong> The next column—"Validating"—was way more selective. These are topics where I felt like there was potential, and in a less-efficient system I might have just started writing right from here. The idea in "Validating" is to take topics from gut feel to a place where I’ve got some evidence the topic is sound and I’m confident enough to spend a day writing. </li><li><strong>Validated:</strong> From here, topics either move on to "Validated" or back to "Ideas." "Validated" became the column I could pull from at the beginning of each maker block. I could start my day knowing I had a strong topic that wouldn’t fall apart, I had research to work from</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This process wasn't complicated, but it was vital to the success of our strategy. It ensured that I had a distraction-free environment with a team who knew what I was doing. Most of all, it gave me time to write prolifically. And the more I wrote, the better I understood what content drove traffic and leads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's not for everyone, but this strategy absolutely can work. If you try it, commit fully, validate every idea and write your heart out.</p>

<p>As software teams, we know how important it is to have the right tool for any given job. After all, we’re the people who actually <em>build</em> the tools used for all kinds of jobs.</p>



<p>And now, as more companies make digital transformations, there’s mounting pressure to build better apps, faster. Software teams are expected to get more and more agile, which requires teamwork from development and operations teams to increase their build velocity and deliver new, better solutions —&nbsp;faster than ever before.</p>



<p>You already know that’s where DevOps practices come in. Agile methodologies are the key to delivering the constantly increasing speed and quality that’s now expected. But what DevOps tool is right for the job? When software teams have so many choices, how do they know they’re using the best tool for the job?</p>



<p>Two of the biggest names in the game are Azure DevOps and GitHub, so let’s take a look at both, their similarities and differences, pros and cons, and see which one is actually the better tool for developers.</p>



<h2>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: What are the differences?</h2>



<p>When you get down to the bare basics of each of them, Azure DevOps and GitHub Projects are both project management tools for development teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Azure DevOps</strong> is a collection of services for teams to share their code, track their work, and deploy and ship software. Some of the products included in Azure DevOps are:</p>



<ul><li>Azure Boards</li><li>Azure Pipelines</li><li>Azure Repos</li><li>Azure Artifacts</li></ul>



<p>What sets Azure DevOps apart from the many tools available to developers and software teams is its extended features for supporting continuous delivery/integration (CI/CD). Azure DevOps comes with a pretty robust set of features, including:</p>



<ul><li>Agile tools, like kanban boards, backlogs, and scrum boards</li><li>Reporting via dashboards, widgets, and Power BI</li><li>Git, which is a free repository with unlimited private hosting and pull requests</li></ul>



<p>Azure DevOps has also long supported other Microsoft products, and offered cloud-specific development services like cloud build and cloud testing.</p>



<p>On the other hand, <strong>GitHub </strong>is a massive, open-source code repository that has long been a favorite for sharing and collaboration among teams. It features some of the best source control management the internet has to offer, along with cloud-based code sharing and social networking among an expansive community of developers all over the world.</p>



<p>While Microsoft has spent the last few years making moves to make Azure DevOps more open-source friendly, GitHub has always been designed that way. Think of it like “social coding” —&nbsp;users can work together on projects, share projects for experimentation and specialization, and use the platform to share ideas and find new collaborators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GitHub’s list of features is also pretty stacked, including:</p>



<ul><li>Cod management in both private and public repositories</li><li>Code workflow via GitHub Actions, GitHub Packages, code reviews, pull requests, and protected branches</li><li>Excellent security and compliance tools, from customizable security alerts and automated code scanning to audit logs and LDAP</li><li>A marketplace for finding integrations like build tools, issue trackers, and more</li></ul>



<p>Both Azure DevOps and GitHub are Microsoft products, and when Microsoft acquired GitHub in 2018, it went straight to work at adding integration features that would allow Azure DevOps users to use GitHub as well. Despite how seamlessly the two toolsets can integrate now, though, there are still users who prefer one or the other. To fully understand how to choose between Azure DevOps, GitHub, or both, you need to understand the pros and cons of each.</p>



<h2>Azure Devops vs GitHub: Pros and Cons</h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://stackshare.io/stackups/azure-devops-vs-github-enterprise">reviews</a> from users, there are plenty of pros and cons to consider with both Azure DevOps and GitHub tools.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Azure DevOps Pros and Cons</h3>



<p>Let’s start with Azure DevOps.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Azure DevOps Pros and Cons</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pros</strong></td><td><strong>Cons</strong></td></tr><tr><td>– Complete, flexible, and powerful set of tools<br>– Huge ecosystem of extensions<br>– One-stop-shop for all tools teams need for agile methodology and DevOps<br>– Constantly improving<br>– Free for five or fewer users<br>– Supports open source</td><td>– Some users describe it as a “Jack of all trades, master of none”<br>– Expensive for large teams</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3>GitHub Pros and Cons</h3>



<p>And now for GitHub’s pros and cons.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>GitHub Pros and Cons</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pros</strong></td><td><strong>Cons</strong></td></tr><tr><td>– Constant new features useful for developers<br>– Brings social aspects into programming<br>– Fast and easy version control<br>– Industry standard for open source projects<br>– Extremely affordable</td><td>– The UI is not as simple as some other tools, meaning there can be a learning curve to use</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As you can see, real users think both these tools have a lot of pros, and not too many cons. So which one is actually better? Let’s take a look at how they stack up in different areas.</p>



<h2>How Do Azure DevOps and GitHub Compare?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Choosing the right tool for your team means evaluating both Azure DevOps and GitHub in a number of important areas. Here’s how they stack up against one another.</p>



<h3>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: Included Features</h3>



<p><em>Azure DevOps</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p><em>GitHub</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p>When it comes to their features and capabilities, both Azure DevOps and GitHub are powerful, stacked toolsets. Both are comprehensive and feature-rich, allowing teams to share and track their projects and code, opening doors for collaboration across teams, and creating an environment for quickly building software with CI/CD in mind.</p>



<p>We’ve already discussed a lot of the features that make both Azure DevOps and GitHub stand out in a sea of tools developers can choose from, so we’ll just say this: These are both pretty comprehensive and formidable sets of tools for teams of all sizes that come with useful integrations, collaboration support, and other features that make them powerful and attractive to all software teams.</p>



<h3>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: Ease of Use</h3>



<p><em>Azure DevOps</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p><em>GitHub</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p>Both Azure DevOps and GitHub should be reasonably simple for the average software team to learn and use. They both have attractive, elegant interfaces as well as simple integrations with tools that should already be familiar to many developers.</p>



<p>It all depends on your team, though, and for some types of development, there may be a learning curve involved with either Azure DevOps or GitHub. While neither tool is <em>difficult</em> to use, they’re also not perfectly intuitive. However, to help combat this, both tools offer tutorials and courses, like GitHub’s fun <a href="https://lab.github.com/">Learning Lab</a>.</p>



<h3>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: Community Support</h3>



<p><em>Azure DevOps</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p><em>GitHub</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p>When it comes to community support, GitHub almost has to come out on top just because of the way it was designed: As a social, collaborative platform. Simply because of that, GitHub has some of the best community support there is in this industry.</p>



<p>But Azure DevOps users aren’t on their own by any means. While Azure DevOps products don’t quite have the same social support, Microsoft does have Azure DevOps virtual assistants who are available to help customers with questions. And if you need more support, you can purchase an Azure Support Plan.</p>



<h3>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: Release Rate</h3>



<p><em>Azure DevOps</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p><em>GitHub: 5/5</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p>Azure DevOps is a tool that’s been around (in many different iterations) for some time. Formerly known as Team Foundation Server (TFS) and Visual Studio Team System, Azure DevOps sees regular releases and feature additions as users’ needs shift.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, GitHub has evolved over its lifespan. It started as an online, social code repository, and has since grown into the suite of tools it contains today. Still, GitHub sees multiple new releases each month, including essentials like security updates, and new features as needed.</p>



<h3>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: Pricing</h3>



<p><em>Azure DevOps</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p><em>GitHub</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p>For many teams, the cost is a major consideration when it comes to choosing the tools you’ll use in the long-term. Both Azure DevOps and GitHub offer different pricing plans and models depending on what a team might need.</p>



<p>Azure DevOps has per-user licenses available for purchase, and also sells bundles of services or individual units of usage. The Basic Plan costs $6 per user per month, and gives your users access to Pipelines, Boards, Repos, and Artifacts. Adding Azure’s Test Plans service increases the price pretty significantly, up to $52 per user per month.</p>



<p>GitHub, on the other hand, is widely viewed to be a more affordable option. All public, open-source projects can be hosted for free, and private repository plans start at $7 per month for personal use, up to $21 per user per month for enterprise plans.</p>



<h3>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: API, Extensibility, and Third-Party Integrations</h3>



<p><em>Azure DevOps</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p><em>GitHub</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p>Both Azure DevOps and GitHub allow for interfacing with their platforms via API very seamlessly. They also both offer extensive marketplaces of third-party integrations, from your favorite chat tools like Slack and HipChat to CI/CD tools like Semaphore and Travis CI.</p>



<p>There is a wide range of outside tools that communicate well with Azure DevOps, including REST APIs, command-line tools, web-based tools, desktop client developers, and more.</p>



<p>And GitHub Apps and Actions is where users can find a similarly wide variety of tools and solutions that integrate seamlessly with GitHub.</p>



<h3>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: Security</h3>



<p><em>Azure DevOps</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p><em>GitHub: 4/5</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p>And finally, there’s the question of security — a pretty important consideration for most software teams. For this, we’ll turn to some security experts: UpGuard, which <a href="https://www.upguard.com/blog/what-are-security-ratings">creates objective, data-driven security ratings</a> for online companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>UpGuard rates Microsoft’s Azure website at <a href="https://www.upguard.com/instant-security-score/report?c=azure.microsoft.com">751 points out of 950</a>, which is a B rating.</p>



<p>GitHub is rated slightly higher at <a href="https://www.upguard.com/instant-security-score/report?c=github.com">789 points out of 950</a>, which is also a B rating.</p>



<h2>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: Which Tool Is Better?</h2>



<p>So which is better? They’re both powerful toolsets with different pros, cons, and value to add to your team. Because of that, we …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span><p>In 1935, a gentleman called Alonzo Church came up with a simple scheme that could compute…just about anything. His scheme was called Lambda Calculus. It was a phenomenal innovation, given that there weren’t even computers for him to test out his ideas. Even cooler is that those very ideas affect us today: anytime you use a function, you owe a hat tip to Mr. Church. </p><p>Lambda Calculus is so cool that many hackers use it as their secret handshake — a “discreet signal” if you will. The most famous, of course, is PG’s Y Combinator. In this essay, we’ll find out what it’s all about, and do things with functions that we’d never have imagined. In the end you’ll have built just about every programming concept: numbers, booleans, you name it…just with functions.</p><p>City dwellers who drive SUVs rarely consider their cars as ferocious machines that traverse rocky deserts and flooded rivers. It’s the same with programmers and functions. Here’s what we <em>think</em> functions do:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> square (</span><span>fn</span><span> [x] (</span><span>*</span><span> x x)))</span></code></pre><p>Safe, clean, and useful. We’re so accustomed that it would surprise us to find the myriad of ways we can bend functions to do just about anything. </p><p>Let’s step out into the wilderness a bit. Say you wanted to make a data structure for pairs: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> pair (</span><span>make-pair</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>))</span>
<span>(</span><span>first</span><span> pair) </span><span>; =&gt; 0</span>
<span>(</span><span>second</span><span> pair) </span><span>; =&gt; 1</span></code></pre><p>How would you do it? It’s sensible to use a map or a class or a record to represent a pair. But…you could use functions too.</p><p>Here’s one way we can make a pair:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-pair (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b]</span>
<span>                   (</span><span>fn</span><span> [selector]</span>
<span>                     (</span><span>selector</span><span> a b))))</span></code></pre><p>No maps or classes…it just returns a function! </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> ex-pair (</span><span>church-pair</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>))</span>
<span>ex-pair</span>
<span>; =&gt; #object[church_factorial$church_pair...</span></code></pre><p>Now  our <code>ex-pair</code> takes a <code>selector</code> argument. What if we ran ex-pair with this selector:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>ex-pair</span><span> (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] a))</span></code></pre><p>Well, <code>(ex-pair (fn [a b] a))</code> would expand too: </p><pre><code><span>((</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] a) a b)</span></code></pre><p>Which would return… <code>a</code>! </p><p>That just gave us the <code>first</code> value of our pair! We can use that to write a <code>church-first</code> function:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> take-first-arg (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] a))</span>
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-first (</span><span>fn</span><span> [pair]</span>
<span>                    (</span><span>pair</span><span> take-first-arg)))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-first</span><span> ex-pair)</span>
<span>; =&gt; 0</span></code></pre><p>And do something similar for second: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> take-second-arg (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] b))</span>
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-second (</span><span>fn</span><span> [pair]</span>
<span>                     (</span><span>pair</span><span> take-second-arg)))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-second</span><span> ex-pair)</span>
<span>; =&gt; 1</span></code></pre><p>We just used functions to represent pairs. Now, since the grammar for Lisp is just a bunch of pairs plopped together, that also means we can represent the grammar of Lisp…with just functions!</p><p>What we just did was analogous to a city dweller driving their SUV…on a snowy day. It gets a <em>lot</em> crazier. </p><p>We said we could represent <em>everything</em>. Let’s go ahead and try it! </p><p>Here’s what can do. Let’s take a function we know and love, and implement it from top-to-bottom in Lambda Calculus.</p><p>Here’s factorial: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> factorial-clj [n]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>zero?</span><span> n)</span>
<span>    </span><span>1</span><span> </span>
<span>    (</span><span>*</span><span> n (</span><span>factorial-clj</span><span> (</span><span>dec</span><span> n)))))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>factorial-clj</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>; =&gt; 120</span></code></pre><p>By the end of this essay, we’ll have built factorial, only with functions.</p><p>To do this, I want to come up front and say I am cheating a little bit. In Church’s Lambda Calculus, there is no <code>def</code>, and all functions take one argument. Here’s all he says: </p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk2Mzc4MjA4LTc0M2VkMDgwLTExNTgtMTFlYi05YTI2LTFlMGUyOWFmNDQ0MC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>In his rules, you define anonymous functions by popping a little <code>λ</code> in front. What follows is the argument, following by a  <code>.</code> .After the <code>.</code> is the application.</p><p>This is very much akin to a single-argument anonymous function in Clojure: <code>λ x. x</code> =&gt; <code>(fn [x] x)</code></p><p>We could follow those rules, but writing factorial like that is going to get hard to reason about very quickly. Let’s tweak the rules just a little bit. The changes won’t affect the essence of Lambda Calculus but will make it easier for us to think about our code. Here it goes:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk2Mzc4MjE3LTc5OWMxYjAwLTExNTgtMTFlYi05N2U5LWY0ZDIxZGE2YmJkOC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>1<!-- -->)<!-- --> for a single argument function, <code>(fn [x] x)</code> maps pretty well to Church’s encoding. We can go ahead and use it as is.</p><p>2<!-- -->)<!-- --> Since Church’s lambdas only take one argument, For him to express a function with two arguments, he has to write <em>two</em> anonymous functions: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>λ</span><span> f. λ x. f x)</span></code></pre><p>This would map to:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span> [f] (</span><span>fn</span><span> [x] (</span><span>f</span><span> x))</span></code></pre><p>But, nesting our functions like this can get annoying in Clojure <sup>1</sup>. To make life easier for us, we’ll allow for multi-argument functions:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span> [f x] (</span><span>f</span><span> x))</span></code></pre><p>3<!-- -->)<!-- --> Finally, Church has no concepts of variables outside of what’s provided by a function definition. </p><p>For him to express </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>make-pair</span><span> a b)</span></code></pre><p>He would have to “unwrap” <code>make-pair</code></p><pre><code><span>((</span><span>λ</span><span> a. λ b. λ selector . selector a b)</span>
<span> a b)</span></code></pre><p>To keep our code sane, we’ll allow for <code>def</code>, but with one rule: </p><p><strong>You can use</strong> <strong><code>def</code></strong> <strong>, as long as you can “replace” it with an anonymous function and nothing breaks.</strong> </p><p>For example, imagine if <code>make-pair</code> <em>referenced itself</em>:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> make-pair (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b]</span>
<span>                 (</span><span>make-pair</span><span> ...)))</span></code></pre><p>This would break because if we replaced <code>(def make-pair …)</code> with an anonymous function, there would be no variable called <code>make-pair</code> anymore! </p><p>That’s it, these are our rules. With that, we’re ready to make factorial! </p><p>The first thing we need is the concept of a number. How can we do that? </p><p>Church thought of a pretty cool idea. What if “numbers”, where higher-order functions with two arguments:  a function <code>f</code>, and a value <code>v</code>.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> zero (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v] v))</span>
<!-- -->
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> one (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>           (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>zero</span><span> f v))))</span>
<!-- -->
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> two (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>           (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>one</span><span> f v))))</span></code></pre><p><strong>We can figure out what number each function represents by “counting” the number of times</strong> <strong><code>f</code></strong> <strong>was composed.</strong> </p><p>For example, 0 would compose <code>f</code> zero times: it would just return <code>v</code>.  1, would compose f once: <code>(f v)</code>. 2 would compose twice: <code>(f (f v))</code>, and so on. </p><p>To help us see these numbers in our REPL, let’s create a quick converter function: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> church-numeral-&gt;int [church-numeral]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>church-numeral</span><span> inc </span><span>0</span><span>))</span></code></pre><p>Since a church numeral composes <code>f</code> the number of times it is called with <code>v</code> as the first argument, all we need to see what number it is in Clojure, is to provide <code>inc</code> as <code>f</code> and <code>0</code> as <code>v</code>! Now <code>2</code> would do <code>(inc (inc 0))</code> for example, and get us the corresponding Clojure number.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>map</span><span> church-numeral-&gt;int [zero one two])</span>
<span>; =&gt; (0 1 2)</span></code></pre><p>Cool! </p><p>Take a look at how we wrote two: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> two (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>           (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>one</span><span> f v))))</span></code></pre><p>What we did here,  is <em>delegate</em> f’s composition to the numeral before (in this case <code>one</code> ), and then just called <code>f</code> <em>one more time.</em> </p><p>What if we abstracted the <code>one</code> out?</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-inc</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [church-numeral]</span>
<span>    (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>      (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>church-numeral</span><span> f v))))) </span></code></pre><p>Voila. Give this function a numeral, and it will return a new numeral that calls <code>f</code> <em>one more time</em>. We’ve just discovered <code>inc</code>! </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span><span> (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> one)))</span>
<span>=&gt; </span><span>3</span></code></pre><p>Cool.</p><p>Now that we have this function, we can also write a quick helper to translate Clojure numbers to these numbers:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> int-&gt;church-numeral</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [clojure-int]</span>
<span>    (</span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>zero?</span><span> clojure-int)</span>
<span>      zero</span>
<span>      (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> (</span><span>dec</span><span> clojure-int))))))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span><span> (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>))</span>
<span>=&gt; </span><span>5</span></code></pre><p>That’ll come in handy for our REPL.</p><p>Next up, we need a way to “decrement” a number. Well, with <code>inc</code> we create a numeral that composes <code>f</code> <em>one more time</em>. If we can make some kind of function that composes <code>f</code> <em>one less time,</em> then we’d have <code>dec</code>! </p><p>To do that, we’ll need to go on a short diversion.</p><p>Remember our <code>pair</code> data structure? Let’s create a function for it (we’ll use this in just a moment below): <code>shift-and-inc</code>.  All it would do, is take pair of numbers, and “shift” the pair forward by one:</p><p>For example, applying <code>shift-and-inc</code> to <code>(0 1)</code>,  would produce <code>(1 2)</code>. One more time, it would produce <code>(2 3)</code>, and so on. </p><p>Sounds simple enough: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> shift-and-inc (</span><span>fn</span><span> [pair]</span>
<span>                     (</span><span>church-pair</span>
<span>                       (</span><span>church-second</span><span> pair)</span>
<span>                       (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> (</span><span>church-second</span><span> pair)))))</span></code></pre><p>Bam, we take a pair. The second item is shifted over to the first positions and is replaced with its <code>inc</code>ed friend. Let’s try it out:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> [p (</span><span>shift-and-inc</span><span> (</span><span>church-pair</span><span> one two))]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>map</span><span> church-numeral-&gt;int [(</span><span>church-first</span><span> p) (</span><span>church-second</span><span> p)]))</span>
<span>; =&gt; (2 3)</span></code></pre><p>Works like a charm!</p><p>Now that we have <code>shift-and-inc</code>, what if we did this: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-dec</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [church-numeral]</span>
<span>    (</span><span>church-first</span>
<span>      (</span><span>church-numeral</span><span> shift-and-inc</span>
<span>                      (</span><span>church-pair</span><span> zero zero)))))</span></code></pre><p>Remember that our <code>church-numeral</code> would call <code>shift-and-inc</code> N times, representing its numeral value. If we started with a pair <code>(0, 0)</code>, then what would the result b, if we composed <code>shift-and-inc</code> <code>N</code> times?</p><p>Our result would be the pair <code>(N-1, N)</code>. This means that if we take the first part of our pair, we have <code>dec</code>! </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span><span> (</span><span>church-dec</span><span> (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>)))</span>
<span>; =&gt; 9</span></code></pre><p>Nice.</p><p>Next up, multiplication. Say we multiply <code>a</code> by <code>b</code>. We’d need to produce a church numeral that composes <code>f</code>, <code>a * b</code> times. To do that, we can leverage the following idea:</p><p>Say we made a function <code>g</code>, which composes <code>f</code> <em>b</em> times. If we fed that function to <code>a</code>, it would call <code>g</code>, <em>a</em> times.  </p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk2Mzc4MjI2LTdmOTFmYzAwLTExNTgtMTFlYi05MmY2LTVlZDdhNzA0YWE1MC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>If <code>a</code> was “2” and “b” was 3, how many times would <code>f</code> get composed? Well, <code>g</code> would be composed twice. Each time <code>g</code> is composed, <code>f</code> is composed 3 times. That comes out to a total of 6 times!</p><p>Bam, if we did that, it would represent multiplication.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-*</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [num-a num-b]</span>
<span>    (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>      (</span><span>num-a</span><span> (</span><span>partial</span><span> num-b f) v))))</span></code></pre><p>Here, <code>(partial num-b f)</code> represents our <code>g</code> function. </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span>
<span>    (</span><span>church-*</span><span> (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>) (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>)))</span>
<span>=&gt; </span><span>25</span></code></pre><p>Works like a charm! </p><p>We’ve got numbers, we’ve got <code>*</code> and we’ve got <code>dec</code>. Next up…booleans! </p><p>To do this, we need to be creative about what <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> is. </p><p>Let’s say this. Booleans are two argument functions: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-true (</span><span>fn</span><span> [</span><span>when-true</span><span> </span><span>when-false</span><span>]</span>
<span>                   </span><span>when-true</span><span>))</span>
<!-- -->
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-false (</span><span>fn</span><span> [</span><span>when-true</span><span> </span><span>when-false</span><span>]</span>
<span>                    </span><span>when-false</span><span>))</span></code></pre><p>They take a “true” case and a “false” case. Our <code>church-true</code> function would return the true case, and <code>church-false</code> function would return the false case. </p><p>That’s it. Surprisingly this is enough to handle booleans. Here’s how we could convert them to Clojure bools.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> church-bool-&gt;bool [church-bool]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>church-bool</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>))</span></code></pre><p>Our <code>church-true</code> would return the first argument (true), and our <code>church-false</code> would return the second one! </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-bool-&gt;bool</span><span> church-true)</span>
<span>; =&gt; true</span>
<span>(</span><span>church-bool-&gt;bool</span><span> church-false)</span>
<span>; =&gt; false</span></code></pre><p>Do they look familiar? …</p></span></p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><section><p>This post was originally part of my series on <span>Python for Feature Film</span> on <a href="http://www.dgovil.com/">my personal site</a>, but is being ported here with minor changes. The dates have been adjusted to match release dates for the projects.</p></section><p>Python is a programming language that has become integral to the movie making process over the last few years. There’s rarely an animated feature or visual effects film, if any, that hasn’t had Python play a large part in getting it to the screen</p><p>When people think about movies, even programmers often think about the artistry involved in bringing those images to life. However, the technical side of the film industry is something that often goes unnoticed outside a small group of people.</p><p>To that end, I’ve written a few blog posts about how I’ve used Python on several major films that I’ve been lucky enough to work on. Hopefully this shows how much it contributes to the entire life of a movie.</p><p>I’ve also recently released a course on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-maya/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Udemy</a> to teach artists how to learn Python For Maya since it’s becoming an increasingly valuable skill in the industry. These blog posts serve as companion material to the course as well.</p><p>With that intro out of the way let’s continue…</p><section></section><hr><h2 id="what-is-python">What is Python?</h2><p>Some of you may not be familiar with Python.</p><p>Python is a programming language designed to be very easy to read and write. It’s incredibly popular in the feature film industry as well as other groups, like mathematics, science and machine learning.</p><p>You can learn more about Python on <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">the official website</a>.</p><p>It’s important to note that today, the film industry is largely still tied to Python 2.7. There is a concerted effort in 2020 to move over to Python 3, and
we should start seeing larger Python 3 adoption starting in 2021 and moving forward.</p><hr><h2 id="the-feature-film-pipeline">The Feature Film Pipeline</h2><p>The biggest use of Python is in our feature film pipeline.</p><p>This is an image that describes the pipeline at most major studios.
The Pipeline is the arrows that link each department together. It’s responsible for making sure that data flows between each department and that everyone can play well together.
It’s also responsible for the toolsets in each department so that the artists themselves can work efficiently, but for now lets focus on the inter-department flow.</p><div>

    </span></p><figcaption>An overview of the Film Production Pipeline</figcaption></div><p>Here you can see the various stages of a visual effects film or animated feature. Studios may differ slightly from this, but it’s the general workflow.</p><p>The storyboards/footage/previs represent the data we get, and Compositing/Lighting are the last stages of the film for us.
Visual Effects Films differ slightly from animated films because you have to deal with the extra added element of film footage in the form of plates.</p><div><figcaption>A more visual demonstration of this graph is in this video of the making of Ratatouille by Pixar</figcaption></div><p>The Pipeline is responsible for getting the data between departments. Here’s the gist of how it works (though it is more organic a process than the one described):</p><ul><li>We get data from the client or story artists in form of plates, previsualization (previs) or storyboards that tell us what is happening in the scene.</li><li>Modeling look at all of this and generate 3D models of all the assets that will be required.</li><li>Rigging take the modelled assets for characters and apply a virtual skeleton to make it animatable.</li><li>Matchmove are in charge of creating virtual cameras that match the ones used to shoot the film as well as any standin characters or geometry</li><li>Layout take the rigs, and either create their own cameras or take matchmoves cameras and set up the scene. They’re the equivalent of a virtual director of photography.</li><li>The scene is then handed off to Animation, who are the equivalent of the actors. They are in charge of the movement of the characters, and bring the inanimate skeletons to life.</li><li>CharacterFX are in charge of all the technical parts of animation. Muscle simulations, making cloth move realistically, the hair, grass etc… all comes from CharacterFX.</li><li>FX then handle the non animation related effects. Whether it be destruction, fire, voxelization, etc… there’s a lot that FX is in charge of.</li><li>While this is happening, Texturing are in charge of giving color to the 3D Assets so they aren’t just grey objects.</li><li>Shading then takes these textures and gives the assets a material that tells it how light should interact with it.</li><li>Matte Painting are the department we use when it is not logical or feasible to build an environment. We realistically can only build so much, and past that point it’s more efficient to have someone make a very high quality painting instead.</li><li>This all gets funnelled into Lighting who are in charge of adding lights to the shot and rendering the image out. They also do a little bit of compositing to sweeten the image. On an animated feature this may be the end of the show.</li><li>On a visual effects show, we have to prepare the plates by either removing unwanted elements, removing noise or removing the lens warp. This is handled by Plate Prep,also known as RotoPaint.</li><li>Finally everything goes to Compositing who take all the images and integrate our CG renders into the actual film plate. On a visual effects show, this will be the last stage.</li></ul><p>We use Python to tie all these bits together.
In the next section I’ll go over publishing before moving onto describing how Python is used for the individual departments.</p><h3 id="publishing-and-asset-management">Publishing and Asset Management</h3><p>This is pretty much the core of traditional pipeline, to make sure assets can be shared between departments and be tracked.</p><p>The first part of this is Asset Publishing.</p><p>When a department deems it’s work ready, it decides to publish it so the next department in the chain can consume it. For example modeling exports models, but does animation export animation? Well that depends on who is consuming it. This is dependent on whether it needs to be interactive past this point or not.</p><p>For geometry  we often just publish as a geometry cache using Alembic  which is a industry standard developed by Imageworks and ILM so that we can have a consistent cache format.
For point cloud data, we either use Alembic or OpenVDB, for images we tend to use tiff’s or OpenEXR.
Soon the industry will probably also standardize on a universal scene format from Pixar called OpenUSD.</p><p>Anyway  the idea is to generally keep the data in the most efficient format possible, while allowing for easy interchange. Cache data is often best because you really only take an IO hit, which is cheap, versus a deformation hit, which can be very expensive.</p><p>This all gets really complex though. Artists don’t need to know where their data is coming from or going to, or even how it gets there. They just need to be able to load it in and publish it out.</p><p>This is the pipeline. We develop the UI’s and the tools to do this in a very user friendly manner.</p><div>

    <figcaption><a href="https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish-qml">Pyblish</a> is a tool by Marcus Ottosson that is similar to many publishing tools in studios</figcaption></div><p>To publish data, the user just has to open a publish UI that will validate their assets against some tests, and then send it off to the machine farms where the conversion to one of the open formats happens.</p><p>To ingest the published data, we similarly just have an asset browser that lets the artist pick which asset they want. Often they just see a thumbnail and description. The details are irrelevant to most artists.</p><p>Because these publishing and asset management systems need to be common to multiple apps, we develop them in Python and Qt (PyQt or PySide) , which allows us to reuse our code without recompiling for each application and makes it easy to rapidly add functionality where needed.</p><p>This is common to pretty much every department, so I figure it warrants its own section here rather than repeating for each.</p><hr><h3 id="modeling">Modeling</h3><p>Modeling is the department in charge of creating the 3D source geometry used by every other department.
Often there are quite a few repetitive tasks involved in regards to placing or editing geometry, or even just managing the scene.</p><div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><span>As I dabbled in SEO and content marketing, I quickly ran into a problem: I had way more content ideas to write about than there was time for.</span></p> <p><span>An article about a not-too-complicated topic would take me 2 hours to write, plus research and editing. But some of these topics weren't all that interesting, and I didn't want to spend all my time writing. </span></p> <p><span>I needed a way to scale this.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Outsourcing </span></h3></p> <p><span>The first thought was to hire freelance writers. In this case, I could focus on finding topics and outlining them and have others flesh these out into complete articles. This is a common practice among content marketers. </span></p> <p><span>I hired three writers from different countries on Upwork to write about different topics. The cost came down to about $10 for a 700-word article. The turnaround was fast too. But the quality wasn't immediately publishable. I would still have to spend a lot of time editing the drafts myself, on top of the overhead of working with the writers.</span></p> <p><span>At this point, the hacker in me said, "that's it, I'm turning my attention to automation."</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Generating Content with </span> <strike>GPT-3</strike> <span> GPT-2</span></h3></p> <p><span>The first content automation approach was to use a generative language model given a prompt. </span> <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/" target="_blank"><span>OpenAI's GPT-3</span></a> <span> has been making waves with the huge model and cool demos, so it was a good place to start.</span></p> <p><span>At the time of writing, I didn't have access to GPT-3 (by the way, if anyone can hook me up that'd be great). Instead, I used </span> <a href="https://huggingface.co/gpt2" target="_blank"><span>Hugging Face</span></a> <span>'s implementation of GPT-2, which was similar but with fewer parameters. </span></p> <p><span>I would give it an article prompt, say the title or first sentence I had in mind, and GPT-2 would spit out a plausible-sounding paragraph. The output read like human writing, which was good. But it was too free-form and off-topic for my use case. Playing with the model parameters that I could tweak didn't help with this either.</span></p> <p><span>I needed more control over the output topics.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Trying Production Services</span></h3></p> <p><span>Then I thought, maybe there are more production-ready services I could use. Sure enough, I came across </span> <a href="https://contentyze.com/" target="_blank"><span>Contentyze</span></a> <span> on an </span> <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/175-przemek-chojecki-of-contentyze" target="_blank"><span>IndieHackers podcast</span></a> <span> episode and was excited to try it out. </span></p> <p><span>It promised a lot on the landing page. And it had an interface that was easy to use. But the outputs just weren't usable. It just seemed like a wrapper on top of the language models I already tried.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Paraphrasing a Paragraph </span></h3></p> <p><span>I thought of a different approach. What if I took existing content, automatically paraphrased it, and added my unique angle at the end?</span></p> <p><span>I could take the content that ranked on the first page of Google for my topic and repurpose it as a starting point for my draft. And to simplify the problem, I could start with paraphrasing one paragraph (or sentence) at a time. </span></p> <p><span>And if I could crack this, this would be immediately useful for content writers and college students alike.</span></p> <p><span>This direction seemed promising!</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Syntax-guided Controlled Generation of Paraphrases (SCGP)</span></h3></p> <p><span>I skimmed the latest natural language processing (NLP) research for the task of automatic paraphrasing. The first paper that caught my attention was the </span> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08417" target="_blank"><span>Syntax-guided Controlled Generation of Paraphrases (SCGP)</span></a> <span> paper (2020) by researchers at the Indian Institute of Science, Microsoft Research, and Google.</span></p> <p><span>It worked like this: given an input sentence (the sentence to be paraphrased) and an exemplar sentence, the model would "generate syntax conforming sentences [conforming to the exemplar] while not compromising on relevance". They even </span> <a href="https://github.com/malllabiisc/SGCP" target="_blank"><span>included the code</span></a> <span> and a pre-trained model. </span></p> <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rumin-gcs-bucket/newsletter/sgcp.png"></p>  <p><span>Big promise from a strong team. Let's give it a try!</span></p> <p><span>And...the output was disappointing. I took the pre-trained model and ran it on the test data they provided (that is, not even using my own content). The results were far from even correct sentences. Here's one example:</span></p> <p><em>Input Sentence: why do some people like cats more than dogs ? 
</em></p> <p><em>Exemplar Sentence: why do some people develop food allergies later in life ? </em></p> <p><em>Output Paraphrase: why do some people prefer dog puppies more than dogs in ?</em></p> <p><span>Fancy approach on paper, but this wouldn't fit my use case.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Word Embedding Attention Network (WEAN)</span></h3></p>  <p><span>The model would use word embeddings (vector representation) to capture the meanings of the words and generate words from decoding the embeddings. That sounded great in theory.</span></p> <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rumin-gcs-bucket/newsletter/wean.png"></p>  <p><span>In practice though, the outputs still weren't good enough. Using their pre-trained model, the outputs resembled correct sentences, but only for very simple phrases. For more meaningful sentences, often the model would not paraphrase at all. That is, the output would look exactly the same as the input. That was a deal-breaker for this use case since I couldn't just plagiarize other people's content.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Conclusion</span></h3></p> <p><span>This was my first foray into delegating my writing. Many approaches I took sounded great in theory, but the outputs just weren't good enough at the time of writing. Though directionally I still think this is promising, as the automated techniques get more sophisticated. </span></p> <p><span>To this end, there are a few more ideas I can try: </span></p> <p><li><span>Run the paraphrase model outputs through a grammar-checking API. At least then I would eliminate the grammatical errors.</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Train models some more with my custom data, or tweak the model architecture to apply more constraints to the text generation.</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Try GPT-3 when I get access to it.</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Generate content from underlying structured data.</span></li></p> <p><span>Thanks for reading this much.</span></p>

<p>My friend sent a picture to our group chat complaining about the subtitles on his video.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.sharparam.com/2020/10/19/2020-10-19_00-53-28-310.png" alt="weird subtitle"></p>
<p>He assumed this was due to the OCR program used to generate the subtitles. Naturally he was confused how it managed to interpret <code>'s</code> as two random chinese glyphs. I was interested and asked him to extract the subtitles so that we could search for more occurences.</p>
<p>It turns out, there were plenty of places where <code>'s</code> was properly written in the subtitles, but 20 places where there were two random chinese glyphs. They were not all the same two glyphs. The resulting glyphs were always consistent with what the original text was.</p>

<td>‘l</td>
<td>鈥檒</td>
<td><code>U+9225 U+6A92</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I have no idea what could have caused this replacement. There are plenty of words in the subtitle file that have apostrophes without a problem. I thought it might be an encoding problem, since the replacement for l was one codepoint before m.</p>
<p>The offset between the character for <code>m</code> and <code>U+6A93</code> was <code>0x6a26</code>, same for <code>l</code> and its replacement. The offset for <code>s</code> was <code>0x6a27</code> which just confused me even more.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to take a look at the rest of the subtitles to see what they can find, you can find them <a href="https://pastebin.com/raw/GQh3168K">here</a>. Email me or post in the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24826807">hacker news thread</a> if you find anything!</p>

    <p>TL;DR: These are the 3 major steps we took to reduce our memory footprint (0.2Gb instead of 4Gb) and the time to generate the reports (2m instead of 15m):</p>

<ul>
  <li>streamed the data directly to disk with <a href="https://github.com/felixbuenemann/xlsxtream">xlsxtream</a>;</li>
  <li>switched the memory allocator to <a href="http://jemalloc.net/">jemalloc</a>; and</li>
  <li>selected only what we needed, while avoiding ActiveRecord when pulling large amounts of data from the database</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="our-setup">Our setup</h2>

<p>Our main app used to be a rather big Rails monolith (235 Models, 220 Controllers, …) that was running on Heroku for the last few years.</p>

<p>Recently, we moved towards developing all new stuff as a smaller (micro) services alongside this monolith.
But hosting these smaller applications on Heroku quickly became too expensive, so we began to slowly migrate them to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/">AWS EKS (AWS Managed Kubernetes Service)</a>.</p>

<p>After a while only our monolith remained on Heroku, so we decided to move it too.</p>

<p>Since there are parts of our monolith that are not so majestic, we expected some problems. Our biggest concern was reporting and its memory usage.</p>

<h2 id="reporting-history">Reporting history</h2>

<p>Reporting was developed in the early days of BetterDoc. Everything started as a simple HTML table. When the need to export them to Excel arose, we added a simple button to download the CSV report. That turned out to be error prone, so we switched to generating <code>.xlsx</code> files instead using the <a href="https://github.com/randym/axlsx">axlsx gem</a>. We also started to generate the reports in the background and upload them to our secure storage. Everything was working great until one day reports stopped coming.</p>

<p>We quickly realised that our Sidekiq jobs were lost. We were using Standard 2x dynos with 1GB of memory and it was not enough anymore to generate reports. We quickly scaled to Performance M dyno with 2.5GB of memory and everything was working again. Performance M dynos are 4 times more expensive than Standard 2x so we needed to fix our reports. We had other priorities so we just wrote a script that will auto scale worker dynos while reports are generated. This turned out to be good enough for the time being (we only needed bigger dyno for a few hours during the week), so we never came around to implement a real fix. 🥴</p>

<h2 id="migration-to-aws">Migration to AWS</h2>

<p>When we started the migration from Heroku it took almost 15 minutes to generate the biggest report. In this time the worker consumed more than 4GB of memory. We were scaling to Performance L dynos to make it work.</p>

<p>Pseudo code for the report was looking like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Axlsx</span><span>::</span><span>Package</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>p</span><span>|</span>

    <span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span><span>.</span><span>connection</span><span>.</span><span>uncached</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>Inquiry</span><span>.</span><span>reporting</span><span>.</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>:appointments</span><span>,</span> <span>:iterations</span><span>).</span><span>find_each</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>inquiry</span><span>|</span>
        <span>sheet</span><span>.</span><span>add_row</span><span>(</span><span>values_for_report</span><span>(</span><span>inquiry</span><span>))</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>p</span><span>.</span><span>serialize</span><span>(</span><span>"report.xlsx"</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="step-1-stream-to-excel">Step 1: Stream to Excel</h2>

<p>We were using <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Batches.html#method-i-find_each">find_each</a> so that <code>ActiveRecord</code> objects got initialized in batches instead of all at once. But <a href="https://github.com/randym/axlsx">axlsx</a> still built up the whole report in memory before writing it disk. To avoid this we switched to the <a href="https://github.com/felixbuenemann/xlsxtream">xlsxtream</a> gem which streams the rows to disk instead of writting them all at once. Luckily for us, the authors of <a href="https://github.com/felixbuenemann/xlsxtream">xlsxtream</a> were smart to keep the API very similar to <a href="https://github.com/randym/axlsx">axlsx</a> so the required changes were minimal.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Xlsxtream</span><span>::</span><span>Workbook</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>"report.xlsx"</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>wb</span><span>|</span>
  <span>wb</span><span>.</span><span>add_worksheet</span><span>(</span><span>name: </span><span>"Some report"</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>sheet</span><span>|</span>
    <span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span><span>.</span><span>connection</span><span>.</span><span>uncached</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>Inquiry</span><span>.</span><span>reporting</span><span>.</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>:appointments</span><span>,</span> <span>:iterations</span><span>).</span><span>find_each</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>inquiry</span><span>|</span>
        <span>sheet</span><span>.</span><span>add_row</span><span>(</span><span>valuse_for_report</span><span>(</span><span>inquiry</span><span>))</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This change was enough to keep memory usage in a 2Gb - 2.5GB range and we were pretty confident that this should be enough to make it work on AWS. We migrated our monolith, tested everything on staging and everything worked fine. 👍</p>

<h2 id="step-2-reduce-memory-fragmentation">Step 2: Reduce memory fragmentation</h2>

<p>Soon after deploy to production we got a ticket reported that some reports were not being generated. Our Sidekiq workers were killed and restarted cause they were reaching memory limits. Generating the reports kept our workers busy for a longer period of time, so they were using a high number of threads. We were already aware of <a href="https://www.mikeperham.com/2018/04/25/taming-rails-memory-bloat/">ruby’s memory fragmentation issue</a> when using multiple theads, so we decided to try <a href="http://jemalloc.net/">jemalloc</a>. In a few hours we had jemalloc running in production and reports were succesfully generated with memory usage below 1.5GB. 💪</p>

<h2 id="step-3-optimize-the-data-retrival">Step 3: Optimize the data retrival</h2>

<p>While working on first 2 fixes we also spent some time thinking if we could replace ActiveRecord. ActiveRecord is a feature rich ORM but it is not a good fit for pulling large amount of “raw” data from the database. We decided to try <a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel">Sequel</a> instead.</p>

<p>Using <a href="https://sequel.jeremyevans.net/rdoc/classes/Sequel/Model.html">Sequel::Model</a> we were able to reuse existing decorators and make the switch as simple as possible.</p>

<p>In the previous ActiveRecord-based version we also were fetching a lot of columns - due to eager loading some associations (<code>Inquiry.reporting.includes(:appointments, :iterations)</code>)  - but only used a small subset of them for the actual report. As such we made sure to only load columns which were strictly needed for any given report.</p>

<p>With this the final (pseudo) code was now looking like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Reports::Inquiry</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>Sequel</span><span>::</span><span>Model</span>
  <span>one_to_many</span> <span>:appointments</span><span>,</span> <span>class: </span><span>"Reports::Appointment"</span>
  <span>one_to_many</span> <span>:iterations</span><span>,</span> <span>class: </span><span>"Reports::Iteration"</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>decorate</span>
    <span>Inquiry</span><span>::</span><span>ReportDecorator</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>dataset</span> <span>=</span> <span>Reports</span><span>::</span><span>Inquiry</span>
  <span>.</span><span>select</span><span>([</span><span>:only</span><span>,</span> <span>:needed</span><span>,</span> <span>:columns</span><span>])</span>
  <span>.</span><span>eager</span><span>(</span>
    <span>appointments: </span><span>proc</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>ds</span><span>|</span> <span>ds</span><span>.</span><span>select</span><span>(</span><span>:id</span><span>,</span> <span>:inquiry_id</span><span>,</span> <span>:scheduled_date</span><span>)</span> <span>},</span>
    <span>iterations: </span><span>proc</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>ds</span><span>|</span> <span>ds</span><span>.</span><span>select</span><span>(</span><span>:id</span><span>,</span> <span>:inquiry_id</span><span>,</span> <span>:data</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>Xlsxtream</span><span>::</span><span>Workbook</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>"report.xlsx"</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>wb</span><span>|</span>
  <span>wb</span><span>.</span><span>add_worksheet</span><span>(</span><span>name: </span><span>"Some report"</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>sheet</span><span>|</span>
    <span>dataset</span><span>.</span><span>paged_each</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>inquiry</span><span>|</span>
      <span>sheet</span><span>.</span><span>add_row</span><span>(</span><span>valuse_for_report</span><span>(</span><span>inquiry</span><span>))</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When these changes were deployed, the memory usage of our production workers dropped to below 1GB. As a nice bonus our biggest report got generated in less than 2 minutes (from over 15 minutes before), and only consumed around 250MB of memory.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>We should’ve done a lot of this when we first expirienced issues.</p>

<p>If you are generating big Excel files do it the right way from the beginning: stream the data and make sure to load only what you need.</p>

<p>Oh, and use jemalloc and Sequel, they are great!</p>

In this article, you will find out how attention works and what causes it to alter.</p><p>But before going into the details, let’s talk about what attention is.</p><h2 id="a-small-window-into-the-vast-world">A Small Window Into The Vast World</h2><p>Attention is the process that selects which sensory information is preferentially processed and ultimately reaches our awareness.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/attention-satellitte-dish-analogy.png" alt="Satellite dish"></p><p>Consider the satellite dish. The signal from every satellite TV channel propagates through the air at every moment. And the satellite dish receives every frequency, but it amplifies only the channel we set it to. Millions of hours of airtime beam through space each moment, but we only see and hear what the satellite dish is tuned to, what it is focused on.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p><p>So it is with our brains and attention. We are bombarded with sensory information at any given moment: lights, sounds, sights, smells, balance, and more, but we direct our attention only to certain stimuli: the screen we see in front of us or a song we are listening to. Our attention works like a filter - we focus on what we like and filter out what we don’t seek. Like a satellite dish, the brain receives a flood of signal, but it promotes to our awareness only what we are interested in.</p><h2 id="orienting-attention-from-within-and-without">Orienting Attention From Within And Without</h2><p>We can orient our attention toward what we want or need as we decide. We are in charge of our attention. We are masters of it… Until we are not.</p><p>Studies have shown, and, from your experience, you can easily recall numerous cases when you are focusing on something but get distracted by noises, sights, people, and other unrelated things. Therefore, even though we are in charge of our attention, there is a lot more happening in the background.</p><p>In 2002, Maurizio Corbetta and Gordon L. Shulman published a paper<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> in which they addressed the evidence of the two types of attention: the one that can be deployed under voluntary control and the other that can be captured by unexpected or salient events.</p><h2 id="goal-directed-attention-top-down">Goal-Directed Attention (Top-Down)</h2><p>Goal-Directed attention (GDA) is the cognitive effort we make when we are curious about something or when we focus on something that is aligned with our goals. And by “goals” here, I don’t mean some grandiose, life-defining objectives. If I ask you to look at the blue circle in the image below, focusing your attention on it is also a goal you are pursuing.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/colored-circles.png" alt="Image with three circles of different colors"></p><p>Another example is that you read these words now by deliberate focus and process the meaning of the text you see. Or whenever you speak with someone, you focus on the words they say and the meaning they try to communicate.</p><p>One essential characteristic of Goal-Directed attention is the fact that it is very narrow.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/gda.png" alt="Image with Goal-Directed attention that is narrow"></p><p>Since we purposefully direct the Goal-Directed attention on incoming sensory information or internal thoughts, we need to process that information to know how it aligns with our goal. But the conscious processing capabilities of our brains are scarce. Our Working Memory, which is believed to be where we operate and manipulate with data, has an estimated capacity of <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/working-memory/">four chunks of information.</a></p><p>Moreover, we cannot consciously focus on more than one thing at a time, which further thins down the already narrow focus we are able to exercise.</p><p>In 1959, Neville Moray published a paper<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> that described the phenomenon later coined as ** “The Cocktail Party Problem."** Experiment attendants were presented with two auditory information streams — one in each ear, and they were asked to attend to information presented in either one or the other ear.</p><p>The results showed that the verbal content in the unattended ear is blocked below the level of conscious perception, meaning that almost none of the verbal content of the rejected message is consciously processed.</p><p>Visual attention is also narrow. Even if the visual sense has the highest information throughput, we can process only about <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/pixelated-perception/">10,000 bits/sec out of the 10,000,000,000 bits/sec</a> that hit our eyes every second.</p><p>To demonstrate this, let’s play a game. Do you know Waldo?</p><figure><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/waldo.png" alt="Image of Waldo"><figcaption><p>Source:
<a href="https://www.subpng.com/png-actfys/">subpng.com</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>It is a character from a series of children puzzle books. The books consist of detailed illustrations depicting some scenes with many people at a given location. And the goal is to find Waldo. Here is an example of a picture. Take a look at it to get a grasp of what’s in there.</p><p>Now, can you find Waldo in it?</p><figure><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/find-waldo.jpg" alt="Image where Waldo is hidden"><figcaption><p>Source:
<a href="https://pixy.org/1456168/">pixy.org</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>I hope you enjoyed searching for Waldo, but I’d like to discuss the <em>process</em> you followed.</p><p>First of all, you can tell at a glance what the picture above is about. It is some sparsely arranged marketplace with lots of people walking around. It feels almost effortless and natural — you glance over the image, and you form an impression of what is there.</p><p>However, everything changes the moment you start looking for Waldo. Then you begin to analyze the image meticulously, inch-by-inch. Some people go character by character, examining and comparing the character they see with Waldo’s stored representation in their Working Memory. Others might look frantically across the image, trying to spot some resembling patterns in characters (e.g., red-and-white-striped shirt, bobble hat, etc.). Yet others might move horizontally or vertically, trying to find Waldo along their line of sight.</p><p>Regardless of the approach you choose, you will still have to look thoroughly through the whole image until you finally find Waldo (spoiler alert: he’s at one of the corners of the table located at the top-left of the image).</p><p>That’s our Goal-Directed attention in action. You had a <strong>goal</strong> — to find Waldo, and because you cannot process the entire image at once, you have to go piece-by-piece and analyze it in small chunks.</p><h2 id="stimulus-driven-attention-bottom-up">Stimulus-Driven Attention (Bottom-Up)</h2><p>Imagine that while you are reading this article, you hear the sound of a breaking plate in the kitchen, which distracts you from reading. Or you are working on a report, and suddenly, the light starts to flash, thus distracting you from the job.</p><p>As the name suggests, this attention is driven by stimuli. As mentioned in <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/human-senses/">How People Learn — Human Senses</a>, there are five sensory channels capable of receiving information (stimuli) of the following types:</p><ul><li>Vision</li><li>Hearing</li><li>Touch</li><li>Taste</li><li>Smell</li></ul><p>And there is an enormous difference between conscious and unconscious attention throughput:</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/attention-types-throughputs.png" alt="Image with conscious and unconscious attention throughput"></p><p>Although we can consciously process only a tiny bit of information we receive from the world around us, all that unconscious attention throughput is there for a reason. It participates in the unconscious monitoring of the world around us and promoting certain things to our attention, <strong>overriding our Goal-Directed attention,</strong> if necessary.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/sda.png" alt="Image with Stimulus-Driven attention that processes information from around us"></p><p>And it makes total sense from an evolutionary perspective. Imagine some of our very, very far ancestors, on a sunny day, found a bush with some delicious berries. They didn’t eat for a long time, and while savoring the juicy berries, totally immersed in this process, a branch cracks somewhere in the nearby bushes.</p><p>The first reaction is the <em>fight or flight (or freeze) response</em> that happens in the first milliseconds after hearing the cracking branch. And it happens automatically, without thinking like:</p><blockquote><p>“Hmm… what could have caused that sound in the nearest bush? Could it be a saber-toothed tiger? Or maybe a bird? I think it would be more reasonable to get away from it as most probable it is some predator since my brother reported seeing a group of lions recently.”</p></blockquote><p>Thus, some stimuli have the potential to override your Goad-Directed attention, even though you wouldn’t want that.</p><h3 id="the-drivers-of-stimulus-driven-attention">The Drivers Of Stimulus-Driven Attention</h3><p>But what exactly can override your attention? According to the father of American psychology, William James:</p><blockquote><p>In passive immediate sensorial attention, the stimulus is a sense-impression, either very intense, voluminous, or sudden — in which case it makes no difference what its nature may be, whether sight, sound, smell, blow, or inner pain — or else it is an instinctive stimulus, a perception which, by reason of its nature rather than its mere force, appeals to some one of our normal congenital impulses … these stimuli differ from one animal to another, and what most of them are in man: strange things, moving things, wild animals, bright things, pretty things, metallic things, blows, blood, etc.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>Therefore, the Stimulus-Driven attention is captured by either high-contrast changes in our environment (stillness to movement, loud to soft, silence to sound, dark to bright, etc.) or intensity stimulation (extreme sounds, sights, etc.) or by some certain impulses we find vital or appealing (dangerous things, beautiful things, shiny things, etc.), or somewhat “important” (e.g., one’s own name).</p><p>Similar conclusions were found in the Moray’s experiments:<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p><blockquote><p>[…] Described the sort of reports that subjects could give about the rejected message. They could distinguish between speech, noise, and tones, recognize clicks and gross changes in pitch, such as the change from a man’s to a woman’s voice. But the verbal content of the message was blocked entirely, even to the extent of the subject being unable to say in what language the message was being spoken.</p></blockquote><p>Therefore, more salient stimuli, like gross changes in pitch or different tones, are promoted to our conscious attention, but more weak or homogeneous ones, like different words spoken in the same voice, are not.</p><h2 id="the-yin-and-yang-of-attention">The Yin And Yang Of Attention</h2><p>Although the two types of attention have different and sometimes opposite characteristics, it is the interaction between them that allows us to exhibit coherent behavior and navigate the social and physical worlds we live in.</p><p>Goal-Directed attention allows us to perform cognitive-related tasks when we need to concentrate and process information (e.g., communicating, writing reports, coding, operating machines, etc.).</p><p>Stimulus-Driven attention allows us to stay safe and navigate the …</p></div></div>

At RavSam, we also use Flutter for <a href="https://www.ravsam.in/services/mobile-app-development/">mobile app development</a> services. One of the biggest advantages of Flutter is its plugin ecosystem. There are tons of plugins available on <a href="https://pub.dev/">pub.dev</a> build by the community that can be integrated right on the go with our Flutter apps. In this article, we will take a look at some of those plugins which can be used almost in any Flutter app and enhance the User Experience to a great extent.</p><figure><img width="100%" src="https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/20/share-widget.png" sizes="auto" alt="Share Widget in Flutter App" data-srcset="            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/20/share-widget.png 20w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/32/share-widget.png 32w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/64/share-widget.png 64w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/128/share-widget.png 128w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/300/share-widget.png 300w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/360/share-widget.png 360w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/484/share-widget.png 484w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/576/share-widget.png 576w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/720/share-widget.png 720w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/960/share-widget.png 960w,    " srcset="            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/20/share-widget.png 20w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/32/share-widget.png 32w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/64/share-widget.png 64w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/128/share-widget.png 128w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/300/share-widget.png 300w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/360/share-widget.png 360w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/484/share-widget.png 484w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/576/share-widget.png 576w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/720/share-widget.png 720w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/960/share-widget.png 960w,    "></figure><p>Share is a plugin that we can use to share the app content via other apps using the platform’s share dialog.

• 6 min read</p></div></div></header><p><img src="https://blog.allybot.io/images/why-i-stopped-saying-hey-guys-hero.png"></p></div></section><article id="articleContent"><p>I’ll be the first to admit that I’m not an expert in diversity, equity or inclusion. I’m a white, straight, cis-gendered male software engineer from Australia. I build products, fix bugs, and enjoy a good coffee.</p><p>And I say the word ‘guys’. A lot.</p><p>So when I was told that saying ‘hey guys’ might make some people (women, in this case) feel excluded, frankly, I didn’t understand. “I say ‘guys’ all the time. How could it be an issue?” I told myself. People telling me what I can and can’t say? That doesn’t feel right. For years, I held the view that inclusive language was a threat to free speech.</p><p>But all it took was one podcast episode to change my perspective on inclusive language.</p><h2 id="free-speech-vs-inclusive-language">Free speech vs inclusive language</h2><p>My late teens and early 20’s were influenced by the so-called Intellectual Dark Web - Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan, Sam Harris and the like. For the most part, I respect them a lot and still listen to their content to this day.</p><p>Universally, this group is not in favor of “language policing”, to put it lightly. Famously, Jordan Peterson was outspoken in his opposition to Canada’s C-16 bill, which he believed to be a threat to free speech. Peterson was specifically against the idea that he would have to address people by their preferred gender pronoun (e.g. he, her, zir, etc.). In other words, he didn’t want the government forcing him to use inclusive language. Whether or not this&nbsp;<a href="https://torontoist.com/2016/12/are-jordan-petersons-claims-about-bill-c-16-correct/">was an accurate characterization of C-16</a> is another question. But the premise that one’s choice of words could be criminalized in such a way is one that I am not in favor of.</p><p>In the years following the C-16 controversy, the world appeared to split into two camps: one that was supportive of inclusive language, and one that, passionately, was not. I mostly found myself in the second camp.</p><p>That was until a few months ago when I was listening to an&nbsp;<a href="https://frontendhappyhour.com/episodes/bartending-to-everyone-inclusive-language/">episode of the Front End Happy Hour podcast</a>&nbsp;about inclusive language. One of the hosts said something so simple, yet so incredibly insightful, that changed my mind in an instant:</p><p><em>“I question people who have asked me, “Why are we doing [inclusive language]? Like, aren’t there bigger issues to solve?”. Yes, there’s always a bigger issue to solve. But this one’s pretty easy. And it’s not that offensive.&nbsp;<strong>All you have to do is stop doing something.</strong>"</em></p><p>I am not easily offended. And so inclusive language as a concept was initially hard to comprehend. But the reality is this: it’s not up to me to tell someone what’s offensive and what’s not. All I can tell someone is what is offensive&nbsp;<em>to me.</em>&nbsp;Inclusive language is not language policing. It’s not telling someone what they can and can’t say. It’s not a violation of free speech. Inclusive language is about&nbsp;<strong><em>empathy</em>.</strong></p><h2 id="inclusive-language-in-the-remote-workplace">Inclusive language in the remote workplace</h2><p>What is often overlooked about Jordan Peterson’s views on the subject is that he is totally on board with using inclusive language in a private context. He just doesn’t want it to be legally enforced. This is an important distinction.</p><p>If you are talking to someone, and they are uncomfortable by the words you’re using, the resultant conversation is unsatisfactory. They walk away from the encounter at best annoyed, and at worst upset. If all it took to improve your relationship with this person was more inclusive language, wouldn’t it make sense to do that?</p><p>Whether you agree or not, you cannot escape the fact that <strong>inclusion is incredibly important in the workplace</strong>. Making your team feel included at work is better for everyone and everything, including your bottom line.</p><p>Inclusion becomes even harder to cultivate in a remote environment. When you’re working from home, you communicate with your team members primarily via text chat. Slack, email and Jira tickets. Text communication is notoriously hard, something that we all now appreciate in 2020. Your words can be interpreted in wildly different ways, to the point where a productive professional relationship can collapse in a matter of seconds.</p><p>Non-inclusive language generally seems to cause a more subtle, more gradual decay of workplace relationships. If I’m the only man in a team of women, and someone in our Slack channel addresses the group with ‘hey, ladies’, I’ll probably think, “Hmm, that’s odd. Doesn’t she realize I’m in this team?”. I’ll then go about my day as normal. But if this happens every day, maybe I would start to feel like I’m invisible. Like I’m not even a part of the team. Like My work is not impressive enough to be noticed. And so on.</p><p>And the worst part is, without the person reaching out to you directly, it’s impossible to know that you’ve upset someone until it’s too late. The value of their contributions declines. They stop proposing ideas in meetings. And then, they quit their job altogether.</p><p>Additionally, Slack channels are different from physical meeting rooms. You often don’t know who is actually in a given Slack channel. You might think the channel is only comprised of males and so saying ‘hey guys’ isn’t an issue. But what if you’re mistaken? Yet another challenge for inclusion in the remote workplace.</p><p><strong>The bottom line is this: inclusive language matters</strong>. When everyone on the team truly feels a part of the team, everybody wins. Conversations improve, productivity increases, and most importantly, people enjoy coming to work. And as more and more of our office communication moves to chat platforms like Slack, the importance of inclusive language has never been greater.</p><h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2><p>And so, I’ve stopped saying ‘hey guys’ for these reasons. And a bunch of other words and phrases. Blacklist, whitelist, psycho, crazy, disabled, the list goes on. If there’s a chance someone will feel excluded by the words I’m about to type, then I’ll choose different words.</p><p>The question then becomes, “Well, how do I know what’s inclusive or not?”. You might argue that there are so many ways someone could be offended, that it’s not a practical problem to solve. I built a <a href="https://allybot.io/">Slack app</a> to help. AllyBot will suggest inclusive alternatives to over 400 non-inclusive phrases to team members. The suggestions are private to you, giving you the opportunity to edit your message at your discretion. AllyBot is <a href="https://allybot.io/#community">free for public Slack communities and educators</a> (reach out to me at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:tom@allybot.io">tom@allybot.io</a>).</p><p>If you’re still not convinced about inclusive language, that’s okay. Thanks for reading my ramblings regardless. But next time you’re chatting on Slack, I’d ask you to stop and think, “Is someone being excluded by my choice of language?”.</p></article><section id="articleNext"></section></section></div></div>]]>

<p><span>With all that is going on currently, from the pandemic, to civil unrest, to an incredibly contentious political climate, even those who were alive at the time find it hard to remember how much optimism there was at the end of the Cold War, particularly around the subject of China. It’s easy to grasp now why there was optimism about the Soviet Union and the accompanying collapse of communism, but people forget that there was almost as much optimism about the Chinese communists. The </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Tiananmen_Square_protests"><span>Tiananmen Square Protest</span></a><span> of 1989, which actually happened before the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall"><span>Berlin Wall</span></a><span> came down and the Soviet Union officially dissolved, seemed like the first shudder of the massive earthquake of democracy and liberalization that would eventually come for China in the same way that it came for all the countries of the former Soviet Bloc.</span></p>
<p><span>It was this optimism that spawned things like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man"><span>The End of History and the Last Man</span></a><span> by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Fukuyama"><span>Francis Fukuyama</span></a><span> a book which has occupied a prominent position in my last </span><a href="https://wearenotsaved.com/2020/09/30/have-we-run-out-of-history-and-legitimacy/"><span>two</span></a> <a href="https://wearenotsaved.com/2020/10/07/books-i-finished-in-september-with-one-i-didnt/"><span>posts</span></a><span>. And even though, as I mentioned, it holds up better than I would have expected, it’s equally obvious that Fukuyama was very wrong on China, but it’s starting to look more and more like everyone was wrong.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The example of this “wrongness” that’s gotten the most attention recently is what happened between China and the NBA. It all started when </span><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/breaking/ct-houston-rockets-gm-tweet-china-20191006-qv2y4m7xvvhopafbnlvkrxb7cu-story.html"><span>Daryl Morey, the owner of the Houston Rockets tweeted, “fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.”</span></a><span> The backlash from China and Chinese companies was swift, and presumably surprising. It’s not worth going into </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/2019/11/11/20959250/china-nba-houston-rockets-hong-kong"><span>everything that happened</span></a><span> but it was quickly apparent to the NBA that billions of dollars were on the line and everyone, including Morey backtracked, apologized, and, in keeping with the theme, basically kowtowed. From this example it might not immediately be clear what “everyone was wrong” about. But I think it can be best summed up by the idea that doing business in and with China was going to be the same as doing business in and with other countries. This is not to say that there aren’t difficulties in doing business in Russia or Saudia Arabia, but not only does the Chinese reaction seem more extreme than what you might expect out of those other two countries, there’s also so much more at stake. Whatever broadcast deal the NBA has with Russia or Saudia Arabia, I’m sure it’s a small fraction of the </span><a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2019-07-29/Tencent-NBA-extend-partnership-for-five-more-years-in-1-5-bln-deal-IJ0UB34uxq/index.html"><span>$1.5 billion</span></a><span> they’re getting out of China. In other words China is different, more different than I think the NBA expected.</span></p>
<p><span>This post is all about exploring how they’re different, because I don’t think that’s quite clear yet. Also, since a discussion of differences could fill several books, I’m going to restrict my discussion to examining very high level differences between nations and cultures. Even with this restriction there are still numerous competing explanations of how China is different, or what the “wrongness” might be, so we’ll spend a little bit of time with each of them.</span></p>
<p><strong>II.</strong></p>
<p><span>To begin our examination I’d like to turn back to the book, </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Whats-Wrong-China-Paul-Midler/dp/1119213711"><span>What’s Wrong With China?</span></a><span> by </span><a href="http://paulmidler.com/"><span>Paul Midler</span></a><span>, which I reviewed </span><a href="https://wearenotsaved.com/2018/11/03/china-and-the-strangeness-of-civilizations/"><span>here</span></a><span>, since, based on the title, it should provide an almost direct answer to our question, and Midler doesn’t just provide one answer to this question he provides lots of them, but most of his explanations and the stories which illustrate them operate at a level lower than the one we’re interested in. That said he does have two very important insights. First, that in China the rules and expectations surrounding business and agreements in general are very different from Western rules and expectations, and second, and perhaps more importantly from our perspective, he has some very interesting things to say about the motivation of the Chinese leadership.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to Midler, it’s very important to understand that the Chinese think dynastically. They don’t imagine a smooth upward curve where they’ll be in power forever, but rather they imagine that they have a limited window when times are good and that they need to take advantage of that window. (Sometimes this is referred to as the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_of_Heaven"><span>Mandate of Heaven</span></a><span>.) Accordingly, Midler asserts that one of the keys to understanding their actions is to recognize that they’re in a rush to accomplish as much as possible before the current dynastic cycle ends. Some quotes from the book:</span></p>
<p><em><span>Beijing appears to be in a hurry, but for what?</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>…When the United States voiced it’s concern over reclamation activity in the South China Sea, Beijing did not respond by cooling down related activity. Quite the opposite, project crews began working around the clock…</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>In moving fast, Beijing was guaranteeing that the international community would apply greater pressure. But by its own calculations, the window of opportunity was going to close one way or another anyway, so why not put as many points on the board before it did so?</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>…No, this foolish rush is about something else, something simpler. It’s about ringing the bell. It’s about seeing just how far China can take things before that great window of opportunity shuts.</span></em></p>
<p><span>Of course, more than helping us </span><em><span>understand China</span></em><span>, what we really want out of an explanation is a guide for </span><em><span>what to do about China</span></em><span>, what actions we should take.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>How does this explanation do on that front?&nbsp; Well it does supply the somewhat counterintuitive guidance that the more pressure we bring to bear upon China the more aggressive they’ll be. But more interestingly it seems to suggest that we can just wait China out. That just like we expected in the early 90s eventually the Communist Party will be removed from power or suffer some other calamity, and the problem will go away. Unfortunately, in the meantime, this does nothing for the Hong Kong Protestors, or the Tibetians or the Uighurs. Nor is it clear even if we can wait them out how long that might take. Certainly the Chinese Communists themselves are determined to hold on to the Mandate of Heaven for as long as possible.</span></p>
<p><span>The final question which we need to ask of this explanation and of all our explanations is how much weight we should give it, and here, I’m inclined to say quite a lot. Of all the people I mention Midler is the only one who has spent decades living in China, and so while it might be possible to argue that others understand the Chinese leadership better (possible to argue, not definitely true) I don’t think anyone I’ve come across has a better grasp of the people.</span></p>
<p><strong>III.</strong></p>
<p><span>In his book </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Accidental-Superpower-Generation-American-Preeminence/dp/1455583685"><span>The Accidental Superpower</span></a><span>. </span><a href="https://zeihan.com/"><span>Peter Zeihan</span></a><span> puts forth an even more pessimistic view about China’s prospects:</span></p>
<p><em><span>The reality of China is considerably different from the conventional wisdom. There are many reasons to doubt the strength of the Chinese system, but let’s focus on those relevant to things geographic and demographic. Individually, any of the raft of concerns I’m about to detail would be enough to derail the Chinese rise. Collectively they are more than enough to return China to the fractured, self-containing mess that it has been for most of its history.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p><span>I don’t intend to spend much time on Zeihan’s concerns, but it’s worth being aware of what they are:</span></p>
<p><span>First, Zeihan’s primary focus is geography and this might be the area he feels the strongest about. Specifically he thinks China is actually three nations (or perhaps four). This may be the least obvious of his concerns, so I’ll include his explanation:</span></p>
<p><em><span>This tripartite system—northern China as the stable-as-glass political core, central China as the nationally disinterested economic core, and southern China as the potentially secessionist territory (and the interior being largely ignored)—holds to the present day. Even contemporary China’s political system reflects it: All of the critical military branches of the government are headquartered in the north, the north and central regions trade of the premiership every decade in order to balance security and trade interests, while the south is not even represented on the Politburo.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>Such a geographic look at the country lays bare the greatest myth about China: that it is united. I’m not talking here about the concept of the mainland versus Taiwan, but rather the idea that the mainland itself can ever truly be a unified entity. Taking a closer look at history indicates that China’s past periods of “unity” are anything but.</span></em></p>
<p><span>Second, that as deep as their rivalry/conflict runs with the US that their rivalry/conflict with Japan is a hundred times deeper.</span></p>
<p><span>Third, that the only reason they’re unified right now is because of the US. We neutralized the rivalry with Japan, we cleared the oceans of predatory navies (Ziehan also makes the point that China is not a natural naval power), enforced </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_navigation"><span>freedom of navigation</span></a><span>, and created and invited them to participate in a global market.</span></p>
<p><span>Fourth, their financial system is a mess, and is more a system of subsidization, than a system of credit. Leading to lots of projects that are technically possible but economically ridiculous. (This is something Midler touches on as well).</span></p>
<p><span>Fifth, demography, China is getting old faster than it’s getting rich, which is bad for all kinds of reasons, but particularly because their economy is entirely driven by exports, which requires new cheap workers. And even if they wanted to switch to internal consumption, demography makes that hard as well.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, and I had to include this because it seems to be the opposite of what everyone else is saying. Zeihan claims that Taiwan, in concert with Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia and Singapore, “Form a line of islands off the Chinese coast that block any possible Chinese access to the ocean blue.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If anything this assessment of what’s wrong with China (everything) and what we should do about China (wait and/or exclude them from the international system) is even more optimistic than Midler’s. Though I should also point out the book was published in 2014, so it’s …</span></p></div></div>

In a nutshell, it is the theorem that states that</p><blockquote><p>$e^{ix} = \cos x + i \sin x$</p></blockquote><p>where:</p><ul><li>$x$ is a <strong>real number</strong>.</li><li>$e$ is the <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/#Key_Mathematical_Numbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>base of the natural logarithm</strong></a>.</li><li>$i$ is the <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/#Key_Mathematical_Numbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>imaginary unit</strong></a> (i.e., square root of $-1$).</li></ul><div><p>Note</p><p>In this formula, the right-hand side is sometimes abbreviated as $\operatorname{cis}{x}$, though the left-hand expression $e^{ix}$ is usually preferred over the $\operatorname{cis}$ notation.</p></div><p>Euler’s formula establishes the fundamental relationship between <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/geometry-trigonometry-symbols/#Trigonometric_Functions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>trigonometric functions</strong></a> and <strong>exponential functions</strong>. Geometrically, it can be thought of as a way of bridging two representations of the same unit complex number in the complex plane.</p><p>Let’s take a look at some of the <strong>key values</strong> of Euler’s formula, and see how they correspond to points in the trigonometric/unit circle:</p><ul><li>For $x=0$, we have $e^{0} = \cos 0+ i \sin 0$, which gives $1 = 1$. So far so good: we know that an angle of $0$ on the trigonometric circle is $1$ on the real axis, and this is what we get here.</li><li>For $x=1$, we have $e^{i}=\cos 1 + i \sin 1$. This result suggests that $e^i$ is precisely the point on the unit circle whose angle is <strong>1 radian</strong>.</li><li>For $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$, we have $e^{i\frac{\pi}{2}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{2} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{2} = i$. This result is useful in some calculations related to physics.</li><li>For $x = \pi$, we have $e^{i\pi} = \cos \pi + i \sin \pi $, which means that $e^{i\pi} = -1$. This result is equivalent to the famous <a href="#Euler%E2%80%99s_Identity"><strong>Euler’s identity</strong></a>.</li><li>For $x = 2\pi$, we have $e^{i (2\pi)} = \cos 2\pi + i \sin 2\pi$, which means that $e^{i (2\pi)} = 1$, same as with $x = 0$.</li></ul><p>A key to understanding Euler’s formula lies in rewriting the formula as follows: \[ (e^i)^x = \sin x + i \cos x \] where:</p><ul><li>The right-hand expression can be thought of as the <strong>unit complex number</strong> with angle $x$.</li><li>The left-hand expression can be thought of as the <strong>1-radian unit complex number</strong> raised to $x$.</li></ul><p>And since raising a unit complex number to a power can be thought of as <strong>repeated multiplications</strong> (i.e., adding up angles in this case), Euler’s formula can be construed as two different ways of running around the unit circle to arrive at the same point.</p><h2><span id="Derivations"></span>Derivations<span></span></h2><p>Euler’s formula can be established in at least three ways. The first derivation is based on <strong>power series</strong>, where the exponential, sine and cosine functions are expanded as power series to conclude that the formula indeed holds.</p><p>The second derivation of Euler’s formula is based on <strong>calculus</strong>, in which both sides of the equation are treated as functions and differentiated accordingly. This then leads to the identification of a common property — one which can be exploited to show that both functions are indeed equal.</p><p>Yet another derivation of Euler’s formula involves the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system#Complex_numbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>polar coordinates</strong></a> in the complex plane, through which the values of $r$ and $\theta$ are subsequently found. In fact, you might be able to guess what these values are — just by looking at the formula itself!</p><h3><span id="Derivation_1_Power_Series"></span>Derivation 1: Power Series<span></span></h3><p>One of the most intuitive derivations of Euler’s formula involves the use of <strong>power series</strong>. It consists in expanding the power series of exponential, sine and cosine — to finally conclude that the equality holds.</p><p>As a caveat, this approach assumes that the power series expansions of $\sin z$, $\cos z$, and $e^z$ are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_convergence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>absolutely convergent</strong></a> everywhere (e.g.,&nbsp; that they hold for all complex numbers $z$). However, it also has the advantage of showing that Euler’s formula holds for all complex numbers $z$ as well.</p><p>For a complex variable $z$, the <strong>power series expansion</strong> of $e^z$ is \[ e^z = 1 + \frac{z}{1!} + \frac{z^2}{2!} + \frac{z^3}{3!} + \frac{z^4}{4!} + \cdots \] Now, let us take $z$ to be $ix$ (where $x$ is an <a href="https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#arbitrary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arbitrary</a> complex number). As $z$ gets raised to increasing powers, $i$ also gets raised to increasing powers. The <strong>first eight powers</strong> of $i$ look like this: \begin{align*} i^0 &amp; = 1 &amp; i^4 &amp; = i^2 \cdot i^2 = 1 \\ i^1 &amp; = i &amp; i^5 &amp; = i \cdot i^4 = i \\ i^2 &amp; = -1 \quad \text{(by the definition of $i$)} &amp; i^6 &amp; = i \cdot i^5 = -1 \\ i^3 &amp; = i \cdot i^2 = -i &amp; i^7 &amp; = i \cdot i^6 = -i \end{align*} (notice the <strong>cyclicality</strong> of the powers of $i$: $1$, $i$, $-1$, $-i$. We’ll be using these powers shortly.)</p><p>With $z = ix$, the expansion of $e^z$ becomes: \[ e^{ix} = 1 + ix + \frac{(ix)^2}{2!} + \frac{(ix)^3}{3!} + \frac{(ix)^4}{4!} + \cdots \] Extracting the powers of $i$, we get: \[ e^{ix} = 1 + ix-\frac{x^2}{2!}-\frac{i x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + \frac{i x^5}{5!}-\frac{x^6}{6!}-\frac{i x^7}{7!} + \frac{x^8}{8!} + \cdots \] And since the power series expansion of $e^z$ is absolutely convergent, we can rearrange its terms without altering its value. Grouping the <strong>real</strong> and <strong>imaginary terms</strong> together then yields: \[ e^{ix} = \left( 1-\frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!}-\frac{x^6}{6!} + \frac{x^8}{8!}-\cdots \right) + i \left( x-\frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!}-\frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots \right) \] Now, let’s take a detour and look at the power series of <strong>sine</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>cosine</strong>. The power series of $\cos{x}$ is \[ \cos x = 1-\frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!}-\frac{x^6}{6!} + \frac{x^8}{8!}-\cdots \] And for $\sin{x}$, it is \[ \sin x = x-\frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!}-\frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots \] In other words, the last equation we had is precisely \[ e^{ix} = \cos x + i \sin x \] which is the statement of Euler’s formula that we were looking for.</p><h3><span id="Derivation_2_Calculus"></span>Derivation 2: Calculus<span></span></h3><p>Another neat way to establish Euler’s formula is to consider both $e^{ix}$ and $\cos x + i \sin x$ as <strong>functions</strong> of $x$, before differentiating them to find some common property about them.</p><p>For that to happen though, one must assume that the functions $e^z$, $\cos x$ and $\sin x$ are defined and <strong>differentiable</strong> for all real numbers $x$ and complex numbers $z$. By assuming that these functions are differentiable for all complex numbers, it is also possible to show that Euler’s formula holds for all complex numbers as well.</p><p>First, let $f_1(x)$ and $f_2(x)$ be $e^{ix}$ and $\cos x + i \sin x$, respectively. <strong>Differentiating</strong> $f_1$ via <a href="https://mathvault.ca/chain-rule-derivative/#Chain_Rule_%E2%80%94_A_Review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chain rule</a> then yields: \[ f_{1}'(x) = i e^{ix} = i f_1(x) \] Similarly, differentiating $f_2$ also yields: \[ f_{2}'(x) = -\sin x + i \cos x = i f_2(x) \] In other words, both functions satisfy the differential equation $f'(x) = i f(x)$. Now, consider the function $\frac{f_1}{f_2}$, which is <a href="https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#welldefined" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">well-defined</a> for all $x$ (since $f_2(x) = \cos x + i\sin x$ corresponds to points on the unit circle, which are never zero). With that settled, using the <strong>quotient rule</strong> on this function then yields: \begin{align*} \left(\frac{f_{1}}{f_2}\right)'(x) &amp; = \frac{f_1’(x) f_2(x)-f_1(x) f_2’(x)}{[f_2(x)]^2} \\ &amp; = \frac{i f_1(x) f_2(x)-f_1(x) i f_2(x)}{[f_2(x)]^2} \\ &amp; = 0 \end{align*} And since the derivative here is $0$, this implies that the function $\frac{f_1}{f_2}$ must have been a <strong>constant</strong> to begin with. What is the value of this constant? Let’s figure it out by plugging in $x=0$ into the function: \[ \left(\frac{f_1}{f_2}\right)(0) = \frac{e^{i0}}{\cos 0 + i \sin 0} = 1&nbsp; \] In other words, we must have that for all $x$: \[ \left(\frac{f_1}{f_2}\right)(x) = \frac{e^{ix}}{\cos x + i \sin x} = 1&nbsp; \] which, after moving $\cos x + i \sin x$ to the right, becomes the famous formula we’ve been looking for.</p><h3><span id="Derivation_3_Polar_Coordinates"></span>Derivation 3: Polar Coordinates<span></span></h3><p>Yet another ingenious proof of Euler’s formula involves treating exponentials as numbers, or more specifically, as complex numbers under <strong>polar coordinates</strong>.</p><p>Indeed, we already know that all non-zero complex numbers can be expressed in <strong>polar coordinates</strong> in a unique way. In particular, any number of the form $e^{ix}$ (with real $x$), which is non-zero, can be expressed as: \[ e^{ix} = r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) \] where $\theta$ is its <strong>principal angle</strong> from the positive real axis (with, say, $0 \le \theta &lt; 2 \pi$), and $r$ is its <strong>radius</strong> (with $r&gt;0$). We make no assumption about the values of $r$ and $\theta$, except the fact that they are functions of $x$ (which may or may not contain $x$ as variable). They will be determined in the course of the proof.</p><p>(However, what we do know is that when $x=0$, the left-hand side is $1$, which implies that $r$ and $\theta$ satisfy the <strong>initial conditions</strong> of $r(0)=1$ and $\theta(0)=0$, respectively.)</p><p>For what it’s worth, we’ll begin by <strong>differentiating</strong> both sides of the equation. By the definition of exponential, differentiating the left side of the equation with respect to $x$ yields $i e^{ix}$. After differentiating the right side of the equation, the equation then becomes: \[ i e^{ix} = \frac{dr}{dx}(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) + r(- \sin \theta + i \cos \theta) \frac{d \theta}{dx} \] We’re looking for an expression that is uniquely in terms of $r$ and $\theta$. To get rid of $e^{ix}$, we substitute back $r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)$ for $e^{ix}$ to get:<span> \[ i r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) = (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) \frac{dr}{dx} + r(- \sin \theta + i \cos \theta) \frac{d \theta}{dx} \] Once there, distributing the $i$ on the left-hand side then yields: \[ r(i \cos \theta-\sin \theta) = (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) \frac{dr}{dx} + r(- \sin \theta + i \cos \theta) \frac{d \theta}{dx} \] …</span></p></section></div>

<p>One of my favorite things is to misuse technology in creative ways. Breaking the rules without breaking the rules.</p>

<p>For example, a hobby project I built long ago was <a href="https://github.com/secretGeek/dod">DOS-on-dope</a>, a working Ruby-on-rails parody, billed as <em>the last batch-file based MVC framework you'll ever need</em>. And there was <a href="http://www.secretgeek.net/console_log">a console.log() adventure</a> in which you played an old school console-adventure-game from inside the chrome developer tools.</p>

<p>The world of esoteric programming is filled with examples of people stretching the rules to breaking point, and misusing technology in creative ways. In particular (for example) I love <a href="http://wiki.secretgeek.net/quine">quines</a>. Quines are programs which output their own source code. Life is a Quine.</p>

<p>A different but somehow related topic I like is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture">brutalism</a>, in particular, this often overlooked aspect:</p>

<blockquote>Another common theme in Brutalist designs is the exposure of the building's functions.</blockquote>

<p>...the tendency to <strong>make the internal external</strong>, and reveal the secrets of the building, in a somehow.... <em>brutaful</em> way. ;-).</p>

<p>A similarly intriguing idea which has fallen into disuse is the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_objects">naked objects</a>, wherein:</p>

<blockquote>The user interface should be a direct representation of the domain objects.</blockquote>

<p>Putting all this together I decided to make a truly naked, brutalist html page, that is itself a quine. And this page is it.</p>

<p>Viewing <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/secretGeek/html_wysiwyg/master/html.html">the source</a> of this page should reveal a page identical to the page you are now seeing. Nothing is hidden. It's a true "What you see is what you get."</p>

<h2>How it works.</h2>

<p>Did you know that the rules of html and css allow you to make <strong>every</strong> element visible, even elements like 'title' or 'style' or 'script', that are normally hidden from view? Those are just elements like any other. You can expose them <strong>all</strong> like so:</p>



<p>With that snippet of code (which is <strong>not</strong> a snippet of code, but an <strong>actual</strong> style block itself!) you can now see every element of this page, including that style block, the html and title tags, etc.</p>

<p>It does have one downside: every element on the page is now a "block" element, even some which should be "inline", such as "code" and "anchor" elements. We can correct this like so:</p>



<p>To give the code a more 'view source' feel, I've also applied <code>monospace</code> fonts, and a generally simple and consistent style to all elements, using a "*" selector, like so:</p>



<p>So far I've put style declarations all on one line, because ordinary html refuses to treat line breaks as "br" tags. But there is a way to make line-breaks display as line-breaks, and that is with this piece of styling:</p>



<h2>Make the internal external.</h2>

<p>The next trick is to make the internal external. We can start by ensuring that the tags themselves, such as paragraph tags, are exposed in their stark, brutal, beauty:</p>



<p>That works for "p" elements, but do we need to have custom styling for <strong>every</strong> element? If there was a way to output the "name" of a tag in html, then we could reduce all of the necessary style rules above to something like:</p>

<blockquote>
*::before {
 '&lt;' name() '&gt;'
}
</blockquote>

<p>And...

</p><blockquote>
*::after {
 '&lt;\/' name() '&gt;'
}
</blockquote>


<p>But alas there is no "name()" function (yet!). So we are forced to generate a chunk of style information like this (via <a href="https://nimbletext.com/Live/1105905186/">NimbleText</a> of course)</p>

<p>Please scroll happily past the next 28 offensively repetitive lines...</p>



<p>Some elements are a little trickier because they have attributes. Consider for example the "anchor" which often has a <code>href</code> attribute. We <em>need</em> that attribute to be visible, including its value. This is done like so:</p>



<p>The <code>attr()</code> function, see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/attr">mozilla docs</a> is a nifty trick, "supported" since CSS 2.</p>


<p>The only other style that is special is "style" itself, which has to include an escape character to avoid being taken literally.</p>







<p>Finally to reduce the visual weight of the before and after pseudo elements we can give them a soft purple color and a low weight font:</p>





<p>Finally, because I believe brutalist design, even when applied to truly naked brutal html quines, is about function, not about deliberate ugliness, I'd like to apply these humble styles that improve the readability of this brutiful missive.</p>



<p>...they're derived from <a href="https://jrl.ninja/etc/1/">"58 bytes of css to look great nearly everywhere"</a>.</p>

<p>One last thing. Although this idea has bounced around in my head for a decade, the thing that reminded me to pipe it into a file was seeing this piece of "Code as Art" from Geoff Huntley: <a href="https://noyaml.com/">no yaml</a>. Bring back the world weird web.</p>

<p>Kind regards</p>

<p>This starts the server on port 1234. then players can connect to it with any tool that does tcp sockets. For example netcat:</p>

<p>For an improved experience you can use <code>rlwrap nc</code> instead to don't have incoming messages mess up your input</p>
<h3 id="joining-the-game"><a href="#joining-the-game" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>Joining the game</h3>
<p>Players can only join while the game is in the pre-game lobby state. People are asked for a name and then end up in the lobby chat. One player is the admin, usually the first person to connect. That person can execute the /start command to start round. Other chat commands are described in /help</p>
<p>After starting the round one of the players is assigned the imposter role, all other players are assigned the crewmate role. After that the game moves to the playing state</p>
<h3 id="the-playing-stage"><a href="#the-playing-stage" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>The playing stage</h3>
<p>In the playing state the players get a <code>#</code> prompt. At this point people can't chat to eachother anymore and can only run commands (without / prefix)</p>
<p>Everyone starts in the cafeteria, everyone gets 7 tasks randomly assigned. You can check your tasks with the <code>check tasks</code> command. You complete your tasks by moving to the room the task is in and typing the full task name, this is case sensitive.</p>
<p>You can see the room you're in by running the <code>examine room</code> or <code>e</code> command. This will also show you where you can move to from the current room and which crewmates are in the room with you. You can move to other rooms by using the <code>go [roomname]</code> command.</p>
<p>The <code>map</code> command shows an ascii art diagram of the map as reference.</p>
<p>If you are the imposter your main mission is not to complete the tasks but to murder all the crew without anyone figuring out you're the imposter. You can use the <code>murder crewmate</code> command to kill a crewmate that's in the same room as you. If there are multiple one will be chosen at random and the other crewmates will be notified someone died in the room with them.</p>
<p>If somebody notices a dead body in the room they can use the <code>report</code> command to halt the playing and move everyone to the discussion stage. It is also possible to trigger the discussion stage by going to the cafeteria and using the <code>press emergency button</code> command.</p>
<h3 id="the-discussion-stage"><a href="#the-discussion-stage" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>The discussion stage</h3>
<p>If a body has been found or a meeting has been called everyone gets thrown in the discussion state. At this point everyone can see who is still alive. Then there's a chatroom which is limited to 50 messages in total, so use the chat wisely. While/after chatting it is possible to either vote to throw someone off the ship or to skip using <code>/vote [number]</code> or <code>/skip</code>. You can also use <code>/list</code> to see who has not voted yet.</p>
<p>After everyone has voted either the game moves directly back to the playing stage or someone gets thrown off. After the player has been ejected it will be visible if it was the imposter (and then the game has been won by the crew) or if someone innocent was ejected.

<p>The crew can win by having everyone complete all the tasks or by voting out the imposter. The imposter can win by killing all the crew or by making the crew vote out all their crewmates.</p>

<p><em>Currently, my job has taken a lot of my time. But who doesn't have time for side projects? At the end of the day - they keep us sane. So I’ve been currently hacking on a good way of managing my finances - and oh boy I’m having fun.</em> </p>
<p>You can ready the whole story, or just jump to my <a href="#so-how-do-i-manage-my-finances-now">current setup.</a> </p>
<center>
<img src="https://duarteocarmo.com/images/fava.png" alt="Fava example">
<figcaption><a href="https://beancount.github.io/fava/" target="_blank">Fava</a>, one of the tools I use for keeping my books</figcaption>
</center>
<h2 id="but-why-do-you-even-bother">But why do you even bother?</h2>
<p>I’ve been keeping track of my finances for about 10 years now. No it’s not something you should absolutely do, but being raised in a household where this was the norm, I’ve naturally found myself doing it from a “young age”. </p>
<p>Of course there are many reasons to track your finances, but for me, the question is pretty simple: I just want to have the power to understand where my money goes, and where my money comes from. And since “information is power”, I’ve been a bit obsessed with documenting. </p>
<h2 id="how-i-have-tracked-my-finances-in-the-past">How I have tracked my finances in the past</h2>
<p>Like every “tracking afficionato”, I started tracking all of my finances using mobile applications. I’ve used everything from <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dailycost-expense-tracker/id566587079">DailyCost</a> to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spending-tracker/id548615579">Spending Tracker</a>. But all of these had drawbacks. Not because of the apps themselves, but because they did not fit my mindset/workflow. I want to know how much I have on account X, and how much I owe to someone next month. And even though some modern alternatives already connect to your bank accounts, I wanted something more “hackable”. </p>
<p>And so I fell into “Excel hell”. I found that I could use a simple app to track my spendings (<a href="https://www.spendee.com/">Spendee</a>) and then, at regular intervals I would put that information into Excel. There, I would create my own overview of “how things are going”, and “where my money was spent”. </p>
<p>But keeping track of things in Excel had various drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had no connection to my banking accounts </li>
<li>Currency exchanges are a pain in the ass (I know there are plugins, but come on..)</li>
<li>I had to create a lot of custom formulas, that were a pain to maintain</li>
<li>Excel is proprietary software, and I don’t like depending on proprietary software</li>
<li>The system was not programmable to my needs - hard to extend</li>
</ul>
<p>So after 7 years tracking my finances in Excel - I decided to look for something better (for me at least)</p>
<h2 id="enter-plain-text-accounting">Enter plain text accounting</h2>
<p><a href="https://plaintextaccounting.org/">Plain text accounting</a> is a movement, or even better, a community. It’s a group of people passionate about keeping track of their finances using plain text formats, programmable interfaces, and hackable workflows. </p>
<p>Imagine having a txt file where you can manage all of your finances - and hack in workflows that fit your needs exactly. That sounded just like the solution I needed.</p>
<p>Upon further investigation of <a href="https://plaintextaccounting.org/#plain-text-accounting-apps">command line applications</a> (because who likes GUIs?) that are inline with plain text accounting, I found <a href="https://beancount.github.io/">beancount</a>. There are also other alternatives such as <a href="https://www.ledger-cli.org/">Ledger</a> (written in C++) or <a href="https://hledger.org/">hledger</a> (written in Haskell). </p>
<p>But hey, I’m a Python guy, and want to be able to hack on this to my needs, so I went with <a href="https://beancount.github.io/">beancount</a>.</p>
<h2 id="so-how-do-i-manage-my-finances-now">So how do I manage my finances now?</h2>
<p><em>Disclaimer: This is how I do it - your current situation and preferences will most likely be very different from mine - so this is by no means a tutorial - simply a showcase</em></p>
<h3 id="out-and-about">Out and about</h3>
<p>At the end of the month, I like to be able to look back and see how much I have spent in different categories such as “Entertainment”, “Groceries”, “Shopping” etc. So when I’m out in about, I usually use <a href="https://www.spendee.com/">Spendee</a> to keep track of those. Spendee has a whole world of other features - but I simply use it for tracking simple transactions.</p>
<h3 id="the-central-piece-beancount">The central piece: <a href="https://beancount.github.io/docs/">Beancount</a></h3>
<p>The whole overview of my finances, uses beancount. I’m not going to go deep on how awesome beancount is, or the whole feature set that it offers. (for that you can start with the incredible <a href="https://beancount.github.io/docs/">documentation</a>)
It basically takes a “beacount file” and allows you to generate several reports / consistency checks/ queries on that same file.<br>
Here’s an example of a beancount file:</p>
<pre><code>; creating an account and setting some balances
2015-01-01 * "Opening Balance for checking account"
  Assets:US:BofA:Checking                         3490.52 USD
  Equity:Opening-Balances                        -3490.52 USD

; an example expense
2017-04-18 * "Verizon Wireless" ""
  Assets:US:BofA:Checking                          -85.18 USD
  Expenses:Home:Phone                               85.18 USD

; another example expense
2017-04-23 * "Wine-Tarner Cable" ""
  Assets:US:BofA:Checking                          -80.20 USD
  Expenses:Home:Internet                            80.20 USD
</code></pre>
<p>So every month, I take my spendings, input them into my beancount file, make sure my accounts and assets all match, and basically do my “bookkeeping” on that file. For this, I use a system called “Double entry counting” (learn more <a href="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method.html">here</a>). </p>
<h3 id="analyzing-everything-fava">Analyzing everything: <a href="https://beancount.github.io/fava/">Fava</a></h3>
<p>Even though beancount can generate some <a href="https://beancount.github.io/docs/running_beancount_and_generating_reports.html#tools">reports</a>, I have found that the terminal is not the best place to analyze data. </p>
<p>Fortunately, <a href="https://beancount.github.io/fava/">Fava</a> exists. Fava is a web interface for your beancount file. It allows you to have a nice to use, easy to navigate website, where you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have an overview of your accounts</li>
<li>Run queries on your transactions (Using the <a href="https://aumayr.github.io/beancount-sql-queries/">beanquery language</a>)</li>
<li>Visualize your data in different times/accounts/categories</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="access-from-anywhere">Access from anywhere</h3>
<p>To make sure I can access my beancount files anywhere, I have kept all of them synced to a nice git repo that syncs with my server. </p>
<p>I have also installed Fava on that server, which basically allows me to access my visualizations in any machine that has a web browser. </p>
<p>And oh boy do I love this setup. </p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>I’m still improving on this setup - creating custom scripts that evaluate my position given my constraints, automatically connect to my assets, and even alarm me if something not expected happened. </p>
<p>And that’s the beauty of not using Excel. I’m now using something I can hack on and make my own - and even though that’s not a complete system - it’s a great system for me. </p>
<p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/blais">Martin Blais</a> for creating beancount and for actively maintaining and documenting such an awesome tool.</em></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> This post has been featured in the awesome <a href="https://plaintextaccounting.org/#articles-blog-posts" target="_blank">plain text accounting blog</a>.</p>

<p>Posted October 18th, 2020</p>
<p>I like bash, and I somehow find that surprising.
Bash is dangerous, bash is old, bash is <em>simple</em>.
Other people - people I respect - like bash too.</p>
<h2>Why not?</h2>
<p>Across all of the awful things that bash does wrong - that make bash a bad programming language - my biggest complaint
is the general idea that bash is unsafe.
It is unclear when - if at all - types are meaningful in bash.
Code is highly imperative.
Error-handling is almost non-existant.
Global state 😱.
This all normally spells doom.</p>
<h2>Aside: why so?</h2>
<p>I often think of programming languages on the imperative &lt;-&gt; functional axis.
I like the languages on the right, and dislike the ones on the left.</p>
<p>The obvious counter is that sometimes you need something quick and dirty, something that doesn't need to compile,
something that doesn't need expensive virtual machine spin-up.</p>
<p>We are sort of left then with bash, perl, php, python, and ruby for quick and dirty.
And, to be fair, I could imagine using <code>irb</code> as a shell environment.
The others: I could not.</p>
<p>Bash has something else going for it: it's <em>ubiquitous</em>.</p>
<p>Supposing for a moment that ubiquity is a sufficient argument to justify learning <em>some</em> bash, I imagine I haven't
convinced you: people seem to settle on a primary language, a scripting language, and some basic bash.</p>
<p>I'm here to tell you that you should just use bash as your scripting language, and any time you need "real" scripting
capabilities, you really just needed your primary language, and if your primary language seemed too clunky, that's a
problem in itself.</p>
<p>I will die on this hill: python is garbage.
Just use bash.</p>
<h2>Something something monads</h2>
<p>Bash has something more going for it.</p>
<p>When we write scripting languages like python, we normally utilise imperative state, and some nice higher level
constructs like list comprehensions, to transform some data.</p>
<p>I'll argue then that python's primary interface is the <em>collection</em>.
Python code is often all about manipulating collections.</p>
<p>Thinking about primary languages, I'll mention a couple.</p>
<p>Rust - my primary language - has a familiar ruby- or java-like syntax (a lot of methods) that many are familiar with.
But - in terms of thinking about writing code and decomposing problems, Rust's biggest win is its powerful enums and
traits.</p>
<p>So I'll argue that rust's primary interface is the <em>trait</em>, which when wielded, categorises the world and declaratively
describes the world's capabilities.</p>
<p>Java has baggage (DI, code-generation, gradle, annotation-hell), but its claim to fame is the Object.</p>
<p>Java's primary interface is in mapping the relationship between different kinds of data, and things that manipulate
data.</p>
<p>Bash has a primary interface too!</p>
<h2>I/O</h2>
<p>Bash's primary interface - and the thing that makes bash powerful, productive, and admired by all - is the fact that
everything is built around I/O.</p>
<p>In that sense, bash is hardly even a real language.
Bash just leverages subprocesses, and gives you fine control over where to wire up signals.</p>
<p>That's what makes bash elegant, but it's also what makes bash incredibly powerful, not only for composing systems, but
for decomposing software architecture into its critical signals.</p>
<p>One complaint about bash seems to be that everyone writes their own flavor of it.</p>
<p>My flavor is one big <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Pipelines.html">pipeline</a>, with some basic
safety sprinked in.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>I have a small bit of software on a cron-job which scrapes property listings online and writes a summary to a
matrix.org channel.</p>
<p>To write this software I decomposed the problem into pure I/O and only wrote the applications I needed to represent that
problem space as a pipeline (ref: <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/rightscrape">1</a>, <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/filterfrom">2</a>,
<a href="https://lib.rs/crates/rightscrapex">3</a>, <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/send_glitch">4</a>).</p>
<p>This pattern is a beaut, and one I'd like to repeat more of in the future.</p>
<p>I've heard folks refer to this as "using bash as glue code", but this seems to be taking things one step further.</p>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>My flavor of bash is better than yours, because it elevates my primary language, minimises bash's safety impact, helps
me decompose my software, and gives me a topic for a blog post.</p>

	<div>
		<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>The Ryuk threat actors went from a phishing email to domain wide ransomware in 5 hours. They escalated privileges using Zerologon (CVE-2020-1472), less than 2 hours after the initial phish. They used tools such as Cobalt Strike, AdFind, WMI, and PowerShell to accomplish their objective.</p>
<p>Ryuk has been one of the most proficient ransomware gangs in the past few years, with the FBI claiming <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-ransomware-victims-have-paid-out-140-million-one-version-has-cost-them-the-most/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$61 million USD</a> having been paid to the group as of February 2020. Earlier in the year, the group grew a little quiet, but that seems to have changed in the past few weeks, with incidents like what occurred at <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/uhs-hospitals-hit-by-reported-country-wide-ryuk-ransomware-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UHS hospitals</a>.</p>
<h3>Case Summary</h3>
<p>In our previous <a href="https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/08/ryuks-return/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryuk case,</a> we saw the threat actors leverage access to an environment via the Bazar Loader malware. This time around, we saw them accomplish their objective faster, but the general tactics and techniques stayed similar between incidents.</p>
<p>Bazar was introduced to the environment again with the delivery via phishing emails. For an in depth breakdown on this loader, see <a href="https://www.advanced-intel.com/post/front-door-into-bazarbackdoor-stealthy-cybercrime-weapon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this analysis</a> by&nbsp; Roman Marshanski &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/VK_Intel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vitali Kremez</a>. Bazar, once running, was seen again injecting into explorer.exe, svchost.exe, and spawning command shell processes.</p>
<p>From this loader we saw initial mapping of the domain, using built-in windows utilities such as Nltest. However, unlike the last case, the threat actors started at a lower privileged user and rather than proceed slowly or cautiously, they exploited the recently disclosed Zerologon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472) to reset the machine password of the primary domain controller.</p>
<p>Lateral movement was initiated via SMB file transfers and WMI executions of Cobalt Strike Beacons. The network indicators align similarly to the prior campaign and were noted by <a href="https://twitter.com/kyleehmke/status/1315499593359122432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kyle Ehmke</a> in response to our last post pivoting off the prior report’s intel. From memory analysis, we were also able to conclude the actors were using a trial version of Cobalt Strike with the EICAR string present in the network configuration for the beacon. Both portable executable and DLL beacons were used.</p>
<p>After moving laterally to the secondary domain controller, the threat actor started on more domain discovery via Net and the PowerShell Active Directory module. From there, the threat actors appeared to use the default named pipe privilege escalation module on the server. At this point, the threat actors used RDP to connect from the secondary domain controller, to the first domain controller, using the built in Administrator account.</p>
<p>Once on the main domain controller, another Cobalt Strike beacon was dropped and executed. Then more domain reconnaissance was performed using <a href="https://thedfirreport.com/2020/05/08/adfind-recon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AdFind</a>. Once this completed, at the four hour mark, the threat actors were ready for their final objective.</p>
<p>Four hours and 10 minutes in, the threat actors used the pivot from the primary domain controller to RDP into the Backup server. Backup servers were again targeted first for deployment of the ransomware executable, followed by servers and then workstations.The threat actors finished their objective by executing the ransomware on the primary domain controller, and at the 5 hour mark, the attack completed.</p>
<p>While last time we commented on the lead time between the first and second day to aid detection and response activity, this case goes to show that you can’t count on that kind of timescale. You need to be ready to act in less than an hour, to make sure you can effectively disrupt the threat actor.</p>

<h3>MITRE ATT&amp;CK</h3>
<h3><a>Initial Access</a></h3>
<p>Access was initiated by a phishing email leading to the Bazar Loader malware executable.</p>
<h3><a>Execution</a></h3>
<p>Bazar relies on user execution of an executable to run. This user was a Domain User and did not have any other permissions.</p>
<h3>Privilege Escalation</h3>
<p>CVE-2020-1472 was used to reset the credentials on one of the domain controllers in the environment. After resetting the password, the threat actors then targeted a different domain controller, potentially due to breaking services by use of their exploit.</p>

<p>On one of the domain controllers we saw use of the Cobalt Strike named pipe escalation.</p>
<pre>C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c echo 92d8cc45954 &gt;; \\.\pipe\446b3c</pre>
<h3><a>Defense Evasion</a></h3>
<p>On the first domain controller that the treat actors connected to after their initial connection, they dropped a DLL and executed it via rundll32.</p>
<pre>C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C rundll32 C:\Windows\system32\SQL.dll, StartW</pre>
<p>Dropped via RDP and executed via rundll32 on the second domain controller.</p>
<pre>rundll32 C:\PerfLogs\arti64.dll, rundll</pre>
<p>Shortly after, the DLL was called again via regsrv32.</p>
<pre>regsvr32 C:\PerfLogs\arti64.dll</pre>
<p>Then a 2nd DLL was dropped and executed in a similar manner on the 2nd DC.</p>
<pre>rundll32 C:\\PerfLogs\\socks64.dll, rundll</pre>
<h3><a>Discovery</a></h3>
<p>Ran on the beachhead.</p>
<pre>nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts
nltest /dclist:DOMAIN
net group "Domain admins" /DOMAIN</pre>
<p>Ran on a domain controller.</p>
<pre>net group "enterprise admins" /domain
nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts
nltest /dclist:"DOMAIN"
ping DOMAINCONTROLLER
cmd.exe /C time
net user administrator /domain</pre>
<p>Then they imported the PowerShell Active Directory module.</p>

<p>They then ran the following looking for host names, operating systems and last logon dates of all AD systems.</p>
<pre>C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C Get-ADComputer -Filter {enabled -eq $true} -properties *|select Name, DNSHostName, OperatingSystem, LastLogonDate | Export-CSV C:\Users\AllWindows.csv -NoTypeInformation -Encoding UTF8</pre>
<p>After already completing the above discovery work and having already pivoted to their 2nd domain controller, the threat actors moved on to AdFind for further domain reconnaissance.</p>
<pre>C:\Windows\Temp\adf\AdFind.exe
C:\Windows\Temp\adf\adf.bat</pre>
<p>Contents of the script ran the following with AdFind.</p>
<pre>adfind.exe -f "(objectcategory=person)"
adfind.exe -f "objectcategory=computer"
adfind.exe -f "(objectcategory=organizationalUnit)"
adfind.exe -sc trustdmp
adfind.exe -subnets -f (objectCategory=subnet)
adfind.exe -f "(objectcategory=group)"
adfind.exe -gcb -sc trustdmp</pre>
<p>The threat actor then ran this command a few times.</p>
<div>
<pre>nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts</pre>
</div>

<h3 aria-describedby="cdk-describedby-message-28">Lateral Movement</h3>
<p>The first lateral movement occurred to the domain controller not affected by the use of CVE-2020-1472. An executable was transferred to it via SMB using a domain administrator account.</p>

<p>After transferring the exe, the threat actors utilized WMI from the beachhead host to execute the file.</p>

<h3><a>Impact</a></h3>
<p>Starting around 4.5 hours after the initial Bazar malware was executed, the Ryuk threat actors acted on their final objectives and initiated RDP connections from the domain controller previously exploited, to the rest of the environment. This time they initiated the ransomware first on the secondary domain controller (their 1st pivot) and transferred the Ryuk executable over the RDP connection.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span><p>In 1935, a gentleman called Alonzo Church came up with a simple scheme that could compute…just about anything. His scheme was called Lambda Calculus. It was a phenomenal innovation, given that there weren’t even computers for him to test out his ideas. Even cooler is that those very ideas affect us today: anytime you use a function, you owe a hat tip to Mr. Church. </p><p>Lambda Calculus is so cool that many hackers use it as their secret handshake — a “discreet signal” if you will. The most famous, of course, is PG’s Y Combinator. In this essay, we’ll find out what it’s all about, and do things with functions that we’d never have imagined. In the end you’ll have built just about every programming concept: numbers, booleans, you name it…just with functions.</p><p>City dwellers who drive SUVs rarely consider their cars as ferocious machines that traverse rocky deserts and flooded rivers. It’s the same with programmers and functions. Here’s what we <em>think</em> functions do:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> square (</span><span>fn</span><span> [x] (</span><span>*</span><span> x x)))</span></code></pre><p>Safe, clean, and useful. We’re so accustomed that it would surprise us to find the myriad of ways we can bend functions to do just about anything. </p><p>Let’s step out into the wilderness a bit. Say you wanted to make a data structure for pairs: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> pair (</span><span>make-pair</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>))</span>
<span>(</span><span>first</span><span> pair) </span><span>; =&gt; 0</span>
<span>(</span><span>second</span><span> pair) </span><span>; =&gt; 1</span></code></pre><p>How would you do it? It’s sensible to use a map or a class or a record to represent a pair. But…you could use functions too.</p><p>Here’s one way we can make a pair:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-pair (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b]</span>
<span>                   (</span><span>fn</span><span> [selector]</span>
<span>                     (</span><span>selector</span><span> a b))))</span></code></pre><p>No maps or classes…it just returns a function! </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> ex-pair (</span><span>church-pair</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>))</span>
<span>ex-pair</span>
<span>; =&gt; #object[church_factorial$church_pair...</span></code></pre><p>Now  our <code>ex-pair</code> takes a <code>selector</code> argument. What if we ran ex-pair with this selector:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>ex-pair</span><span> (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] a))</span></code></pre><p>Well, <code>(ex-pair (fn [a b] a))</code> would expand too: </p><pre><code><span>((</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] a) a b)</span></code></pre><p>Which would return… <code>a</code>! </p><p>That just gave us the <code>first</code> value of our pair! We can use that to write a <code>church-first</code> function:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> take-first-arg (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] a))</span>
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-first (</span><span>fn</span><span> [pair]</span>
<span>                    (</span><span>pair</span><span> take-first-arg)))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-first</span><span> ex-pair)</span>
<span>; =&gt; 0</span></code></pre><p>And do something similar for second: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> take-second-arg (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] b))</span>
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-second (</span><span>fn</span><span> [pair]</span>
<span>                     (</span><span>pair</span><span> take-second-arg)))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-second</span><span> ex-pair)</span>
<span>; =&gt; 1</span></code></pre><p>We just used functions to represent pairs. Now, since the grammar for Lisp is just a bunch of pairs plopped together, that also means we can represent the grammar of Lisp…with just functions!</p><p>What we just did was analogous to a city dweller driving their SUV…on a snowy day. It gets a <em>lot</em> crazier. </p><p>We said we could represent <em>everything</em>. Let’s go ahead and try it! </p><p>Here’s what can do. Let’s take a function we know and love, and implement it from top-to-bottom in Lambda Calculus.</p><p>Here’s factorial: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> factorial-clj [n]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>zero?</span><span> n)</span>
<span>    </span><span>1</span><span> </span>
<span>    (</span><span>*</span><span> n (</span><span>factorial-clj</span><span> (</span><span>dec</span><span> n)))))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>factorial-clj</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>; =&gt; 120</span></code></pre><p>By the end of this essay, we’ll have built factorial, only with functions.</p><p>To do this, I want to come up front and say I am cheating a little bit. In Church’s Lambda Calculus, there is no <code>def</code>, and all functions take one argument. Here’s all he says: </p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk2Mzc4MjA4LTc0M2VkMDgwLTExNTgtMTFlYi05YTI2LTFlMGUyOWFmNDQ0MC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>In his rules, you define anonymous functions by popping a little <code>λ</code> in front. What follows is the argument, following by a  <code>.</code> .After the <code>.</code> is the application.</p><p>This is very much akin to a single-argument anonymous function in Clojure: <code>λ x. x</code> =&gt; <code>(fn [x] x)</code></p><p>We could follow those rules, but writing factorial like that is going to get hard to reason about very quickly. Let’s tweak the rules just a little bit. The changes won’t affect the essence of Lambda Calculus but will make it easier for us to think about our code. Here it goes:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk2Mzc4MjE3LTc5OWMxYjAwLTExNTgtMTFlYi05N2U5LWY0ZDIxZGE2YmJkOC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>1<!-- -->)<!-- --> for a single argument function, <code>(fn [x] x)</code> maps pretty well to Church’s encoding. We can go ahead and use it as is.</p><p>2<!-- -->)<!-- --> Since Church’s lambdas only take one argument, For him to express a function with two arguments, he has to write <em>two</em> anonymous functions: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>λ</span><span> f. λ x. f x)</span></code></pre><p>This would map to:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span> [f] (</span><span>fn</span><span> [x] (</span><span>f</span><span> x))</span></code></pre><p>But, nesting our functions like this can get annoying in Clojure <sup>1</sup>. To make life easier for us, we’ll allow for multi-argument functions:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span> [f x] (</span><span>f</span><span> x))</span></code></pre><p>3<!-- -->)<!-- --> Finally, Church has no concepts of variables outside of what’s provided by a function definition. </p><p>For him to express </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>make-pair</span><span> a b)</span></code></pre><p>He would have to “unwrap” <code>make-pair</code></p><pre><code><span>((</span><span>λ</span><span> a. λ b. λ selector . selector a b)</span>
<span> a b)</span></code></pre><p>To keep our code sane, we’ll allow for <code>def</code>, but with one rule: </p><p><strong>You can use</strong> <strong><code>def</code></strong> <strong>, as long as you can “replace” it with an anonymous function and nothing breaks.</strong> </p><p>For example, imagine if <code>make-pair</code> <em>referenced itself</em>:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> make-pair (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b]</span>
<span>                 (</span><span>make-pair</span><span> ...)))</span></code></pre><p>This would break because if we replaced <code>(def make-pair …)</code> with an anonymous function, there would be no variable called <code>make-pair</code> anymore! </p><p>That’s it, these are our rules. With that, we’re ready to make factorial! </p><p>The first thing we need is the concept of a number. How can we do that? </p><p>Church thought of a pretty cool idea. What if “numbers”, where higher-order functions with two arguments:  a function <code>f</code>, and a value <code>v</code>.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> zero (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v] v))</span>
<!-- -->
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> one (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>           (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>zero</span><span> f v))))</span>
<!-- -->
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> two (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>           (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>one</span><span> f v))))</span></code></pre><p><strong>We can figure out what number each function represents by “counting” the number of times</strong> <strong><code>f</code></strong> <strong>was composed.</strong> </p><p>For example, 0 would compose <code>f</code> zero times: it would just return <code>v</code>.  1, would compose f once: <code>(f v)</code>. 2 would compose twice: <code>(f (f v))</code>, and so on. </p><p>To help us see these numbers in our REPL, let’s create a quick converter function: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> church-numeral-&gt;int [church-numeral]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>church-numeral</span><span> inc </span><span>0</span><span>))</span></code></pre><p>Since a church numeral composes <code>f</code> the number of times it is called with <code>v</code> as the first argument, all we need to see what number it is in Clojure, is to provide <code>inc</code> as <code>f</code> and <code>0</code> as <code>v</code>! Now <code>2</code> would do <code>(inc (inc 0))</code> for example, and get us the corresponding Clojure number.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>map</span><span> church-numeral-&gt;int [zero one two])</span>
<span>; =&gt; (0 1 2)</span></code></pre><p>Cool! </p><p>Take a look at how we wrote two: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> two (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>           (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>one</span><span> f v))))</span></code></pre><p>What we did here,  is <em>delegate</em> f’s composition to the numeral before (in this case <code>one</code> ), and then just called <code>f</code> <em>one more time.</em> </p><p>What if we abstracted the <code>one</code> out?</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-inc</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [church-numeral]</span>
<span>    (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>      (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>church-numeral</span><span> f v))))) </span></code></pre><p>Voila. Give this function a numeral, and it will return a new numeral that calls <code>f</code> <em>one more time</em>. We’ve just discovered <code>inc</code>! </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span><span> (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> one)))</span>
<span>=&gt; </span><span>3</span></code></pre><p>Cool.</p><p>Now that we have this function, we can also write a quick helper to translate Clojure numbers to these numbers:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> int-&gt;church-numeral</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [clojure-int]</span>
<span>    (</span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>zero?</span><span> clojure-int)</span>
<span>      zero</span>
<span>      (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> (</span><span>dec</span><span> clojure-int))))))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span><span> (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>))</span>
<span>=&gt; </span><span>5</span></code></pre><p>That’ll come in handy for our REPL.</p><p>Next up, we need a way to “decrement” a number. Well, with <code>inc</code> we create a numeral that composes <code>f</code> <em>one more time</em>. If we can make some kind of function that composes <code>f</code> <em>one less time,</em> then we’d have <code>dec</code>! </p><p>To do that, we’ll need to go on a short diversion.</p><p>Remember our <code>pair</code> data structure? Let’s create a function for it (we’ll use this in just a moment below): <code>shift-and-inc</code>.  All it would do, is take pair of numbers, and “shift” the pair forward by one:</p><p>For example, applying <code>shift-and-inc</code> to <code>(0 1)</code>,  would produce <code>(1 2)</code>. One more time, it would produce <code>(2 3)</code>, and so on. </p><p>Sounds simple enough: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> shift-and-inc (</span><span>fn</span><span> [pair]</span>
<span>                     (</span><span>church-pair</span>
<span>                       (</span><span>church-second</span><span> pair)</span>
<span>                       (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> (</span><span>church-second</span><span> pair)))))</span></code></pre><p>Bam, we take a pair. The second item is shifted over to the first positions and is replaced with its <code>inc</code>ed friend. Let’s try it out:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> [p (</span><span>shift-and-inc</span><span> (</span><span>church-pair</span><span> one two))]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>map</span><span> church-numeral-&gt;int [(</span><span>church-first</span><span> p) (</span><span>church-second</span><span> p)]))</span>
<span>; =&gt; (2 3)</span></code></pre><p>Works like a charm!</p><p>Now that we have <code>shift-and-inc</code>, what if we did this: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-dec</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [church-numeral]</span>
<span>    (</span><span>church-first</span>
<span>      (</span><span>church-numeral</span><span> shift-and-inc</span>
<span>                      (</span><span>church-pair</span><span> zero zero)))))</span></code></pre><p>Remember that our <code>church-numeral</code> would call <code>shift-and-inc</code> N times, representing its numeral value. If we started with a pair <code>(0, 0)</code>, then what would the result b, if we composed <code>shift-and-inc</code> <code>N</code> times?</p><p>Our result would be the pair <code>(N-1, N)</code>. This means that if we take the first part of our pair, we have <code>dec</code>! </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span><span> (</span><span>church-dec</span><span> (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>)))</span>
<span>; =&gt; 9</span></code></pre><p>Nice.</p><p>Next up, multiplication. Say we multiply <code>a</code> by <code>b</code>. We’d need to produce a church numeral that composes <code>f</code>, <code>a * b</code> times. To do that, we can leverage the following idea:</p><p>Say we made a function <code>g</code>, which composes <code>f</code> <em>b</em> times. If we fed that function to <code>a</code>, it would call <code>g</code>, <em>a</em> times.  </p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk2Mzc4MjI2LTdmOTFmYzAwLTExNTgtMTFlYi05MmY2LTVlZDdhNzA0YWE1MC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>If <code>a</code> was “2” and “b” was 3, how many times would <code>f</code> get composed? Well, <code>g</code> would be composed twice. Each time <code>g</code> is composed, <code>f</code> is composed 3 times. That comes out to a total of 6 times!</p><p>Bam, if we did that, it would represent multiplication.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-*</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [num-a num-b]</span>

<span>      (</span><span>num-a</span><span> (</span><span>partial</span><span> num-b f) v))))</span></code></pre><p>Here, <code>(partial num-b f)</code> represents our <code>g</code> function. </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span>

<span>=&gt; </span><span>25</span></code></pre><p>Works like a charm! </p><p>We’ve got numbers, we’ve got <code>*</code> and we’ve got <code>dec</code>. Next up…booleans! </p><p>To do this, we need to be creative about what <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> is. </p><p>Let’s say this. Booleans are two argument functions: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-true (</span><span>fn</span><span> [</span><span>when-true</span><span> </span><span>when-false</span><span>]</span>

<span>                    </span><span>when-false</span><span>))</span></code></pre><p>They take a “true” case and a “false” case. Our <code>church-true</code> function would return the true case, and <code>church-false</code> function would return the false case. </p><p>That’s it. Surprisingly this is enough to handle booleans. Here’s how we could convert them to Clojure bools.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> church-bool-&gt;bool [church-bool]</span>

<p>Legos are an excellent meta-toy in that they represent the potential for a near-infinite number of toys depending on how you assemble them. Each brick has structure. But each brick is only interesting to the extent that it can combine with other bricks, forming new and more complex structures. So in order to enjoy Legos, you have to figure out how they fit together and come up with a clever way of making the particular toy you have in mind. Once you have mastered a few simple rules, the open-ended design of Lego bricks lets you build anything you can imagine.</p>

<p>Our universe has the same versatile structure. It seems to run according to just a few simple forces, but as those forces interact, they give rise to intricate patterns across many scales of space and time. You see this everywhere you look in nature – in the fractal design of a seashell or the intricate polities of a coral. In the convection of a teacup or the circulation of the atmosphere. And this simple structure even determines the shape and behavior of man’s most complicated flying machines.</p>

<p>To see this more clearly, we are going to start from the basic physical laws of airflow and use them to derive the shape of a wing.<sup id="fnref:fn18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn18">1</a></sup> Since we are using so few assumptions, the wing shape we come up with will be as fundamental as the physics of the air that swirls around it. This is pretty fundamental. In fact, if an alien species started building flying machines on another planet, they would probably converge on a similar shape.</p>

<h3 id="navier-stokes">Navier-Stokes</h3>

<p>We will begin this journey with the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Navier-Stokes-equation">Navier-Stokes equation</a>, which sums up pretty much everything we know about fluid dynamics. It describes how tiny fluid parcels interact with their neighbors. The process of solving fluid dynamics problems comes down to writing out this equation and then deciding which terms we can safely ignore. In our case, we would like to simulate the flow of air through a wind tunnel and then use it to evaluate various wing shapes.</p>

<p>Since the pressure differences across a wind tunnel are small, one of the first assumptions we can make is that air is incompressible. This lets us use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations#Incompressible_flow">incompressible form</a> of the Navier-Stokes equation:</p>

<p><span id="longEqnWithSmallScript_A">
\(\underbrace{\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t}}_{\text{velocity update}} ~=~ - \underbrace{(\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{u}}_{\text{self-advection}} ~+~ \underbrace{\nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}}_{\text{viscous diffusion}} \\
~+~ \underbrace{f}_{\text{velocity $\uparrow$ due to forces}}\)
</span>
<span id="longEqnWithLargeScript_A">
\(\underbrace{\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t}}_{\text{velocity update}} ~=~ - \underbrace{(\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{u}}_{\text{self-advection}} ~+~ \underbrace{\nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}}_{\text{viscous diffusion}} ~+~ \underbrace{f}_{\text{velocity $\uparrow$ due to forces}}\)
</span></p>

<p>Another term we can ignore is viscous diffusion. Viscous diffusion describes how fluid parcels distribute their momenta due to sticky interactions with their neighbors. We would say that a fluid with high viscosity is “thick”: common examples include molasses and motor oil. Even though air is much thinner, viscous interactions still cause a layer of slow-moving air to form along the surface of an airplane wing. However, we can ignore this boundary layer because its contribution to the aerodynamics of the wing is small compared to that of self-advection.</p>

<p>The final term we can ignore is the forces term, as there will be no forces on the air once it enters the wind tunnel. And so we are left with but a hair of the original Navier-Stokes hairball:</p>

\[\underbrace{\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t}}_{\text{velocity update}} = \underbrace{- (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{u}}_{\text{self-advection ("velocity follows itself")}}\]

<p>This simple expression describes the effects that really dominate wind tunnel physics. It says, intuitively, that “the change in velocity over time is due to the fact that velocity follows itself.” So the entire simulation comes down to two simple rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		• Rule 1: Velocity follows itself <p>(+)</p>
		<ul>
		
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<!-- <b>Rule 1: Velocity follows itself</b> -->
		• Rule 2: Volume is conserved <p>(+)</p>
		<ul>
		
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>By alternating between these two rules, we can iteratively 1) move the system forward in time and 2) enforce conservation of volume and mass. In practice, we implement each rule as a separate function and then apply both functions to the system at every time step. This allows us to simulate, say, a gust of wind passing through the wind tunnel. But before we can direct this wind over a wing, we need to decide how to represent the wing itself.</p>

<h3 id="representing-the-wing">Representing the Wing</h3>

<div>
<p>The wing is an internal boundary, or occlusion, of the flow. A good way to represent an occlusion is with a mask of zeros and ones. But since the goal of our wind tunnel is to try out different wing shapes, we need our wing to be continuously deformable. So we will allow the mask to take on continuous values between zero and one, making it semi-permeable in proportion to its mask values. This lets us add semi-permeable obstructions to the wind tunnel as shown:</p> <p>(+)</p>
</div>



<div>
  <div>
    <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/mask/mask_0.00.png"></p><p>Mask = 0.0</p>
  </div>
    <div>
    <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/mask/mask_0.05.png"></p><p>Mask = 0.05</p>
  </div>
    <div>
    <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/mask/mask_0.12.png"></p><p>Mask = 0.12</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/mask/mask_0.50.png"></p><p>Mask = 0.5</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/mask/mask_1.00.png"></p><p>Mask = 1.0</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 id="choosing-an-objective">Choosing an Objective</h3>

<p>Now we are at the point where we can simulate how air flows over arbitrary, semi-permeable shapes. But in order to determine which of these shapes makes a better wing, we still need to define a measure of performance. There are many qualities that one could look for in a good wing, but we will begin with the most obvious: it should convert horizontal air velocity into upward force as efficiently as possible. We can measure this ability using something called the lift-drag ratio where “lift” measures the upward force generated by the wing and “drag” measures the frictional forces between the air and the wing. Since “change in downward airflow” in the tunnel is proportional to the upward force on the wing, we can use it as a proxy for lift. Likewise, “change in rightward airflow” is a good proxy for the drag forces on the wing. With this in mind, we can write out the objective function as</p>

\[\max_{\theta} L/D\]

<p>where \(\theta\) represents some tunable parameters associated with the shape of the wing mask and \(L/D\) can be obtained using the initial and final wind velocities of the simulation according to</p>

\[\begin{align}
     L/D &amp;= \frac{\text{lift}}{\text{drag}}\\
    &amp;= \frac{\text{change in downward airflow}}{-\text{change in rightward airflow}}\\
    &amp;= \frac{ -\big ( v_y(t)-v_y(0) \big )}{-\big ( v_x(t)-v_x(0) \big )}\\
    &amp;= \frac{ v_y(t)-v_y(0) }{ v_x(t)-v_x(0)}
\end{align}\]

<p>Solving this optimization problem will give us a wing shape that generates the most efficient lift possible. In other words, we new have the correct problem setup; what remains is to figure out how to solve it.</p>

<h3 id="optimization">Optimization</h3>

<div>
<p>We are going to solve this problem with gradient ascent. Gradient ascent is simple and easy to implement, but there is one important caveat: we need a way to efficiently compute the gradient of the objective function with respect to the wing mask parameters. This involves differentiating through each step of the fluid simulation in turn – all of the way back to the initial conditions. This would be difficult to implement by hand, but fortunately there is a tool called <a href="https://github.com/HIPS/autograd">Autograd</a> which can perform this back-propagation of gradients automatically. We will use Autograd to compute the gradients of the mask parameters, move the mask parameters in that direction, and then repeat this process until the lift-drag ratio reaches a local maximum.</p> <p>(+)</p>
</div>



<p>So let’s review. Our goal is to simulate a wind tunnel and use it to derive a wing shape. We began by writing down the general Navier-Stokes equation and eliminating irrelevant terms: all of them but self-advection. Next, we figured out how to represent a wing shape in the tunnel using a continuously-deformable occlusion. Finally, we wrote down an equation for what a good wing should do and discussed how to optimize it. Now it is time to put everything together in about two hundred lines of code and see what happens when we run it…</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/optimize_wing.png">

	<p><img alt="" src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/wing.png" onclick="toggleBasicWing()" id="basicWing">
</p></div>

<p>Sure enough, we get a beautiful little wing. Of all possible shapes, this is the very best one for creating efficient lift in our wind tunnel. This wing is definitely a toy solution since our simulation is coarse and not especially accurate. However, after making a few simple improvements we would be able to design real airplane wings this way. We would just need to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Simulate in 3D instead of 2D</li>
  <li>Use a mesh parameterization instead of a grid</li>
  <li>Make the flow laminar and compressible</li>
</ol>

<p>Aside from these improvements, the overall principle is much the same. In both cases, we write down some words and symbols, turn them into code, and then use the code to shape our wing.<sup id="fnref:fn14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn14">2</a></sup> The fact that we can do all of this without ever building a physical wing makes it feel a bit like magic. But this process really works, for when we <a href="http://aero-comlab.stanford.edu/Papers/jameson-cincin-pm.pdf#page=36">put these wings on airplanes</a> and trust them with our lives, they carry us safely to our destinations.<sup id="fnref:fn3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn3">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:fn17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn17">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Just like the real wind tunnels of the twentieth century, these simulated wind tunnels need to go through lots of debugging before we can trust them. In fact, while building this demo we discovered a number of ways that things can go wrong. Here are some of the most amusing failure cases:</p>

<p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/sim_bloopers.png">
</p>

<p>Several of these wings are just plain dreadful. But others seem reasonable, if unexpected. The two-wing solution is particularly amusing. We did not intend for this “biplane” solution to occur, and yet it is a completely viable way of solving the objective we wrote down. One advantage to keeping the problem setup so …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<p>Technology has become as pervasive as the air we breathe today. While our reliance on technology keeps on increasing, there are a myriad of problems that complement the acceptance of these solutions for inconvenience. For instance, social media may have started as a force for good, but it possibly has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/19/the-social-dilemma-a-wake-up-call-for-a-world-drunk-on-dopamine">devolved into a state of dysfunction</a>, one that is all about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook">surveillance capitalism</a>. Likewise, online commenting may have built a degree of community and credibility over the years, but it has also led to a vast array of problems like online toxicity, <a href="https://www.salon.com/2017/08/05/why-facebooks-racism-problem-might-never-be-solved/">online disinhibition</a> and misogyny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe it was Albert Einstein who adroitly stated that — <em>It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity</em>. Possible, but this is why checks and balances need to be put in effect to ensure that there is more than just a modicum of control. As more and more people are converted to a digitalized life, there are sure to be more issues that come to the forefront. If there are problems created by technology then technology will create solutions to those problems as well.</p>
<p>The focus of this post is — <em>The Future of</em> <em>Online Commenting</em>. At this particular juncture, let’s dissect the current state of online commenting, and its future. But before we do, let’s have a basic look at its history.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A Brief Look at the History of Online Commenting&nbsp;</h2>
<p>We hear of the whole concept of letters to the editor, and even letters that were sent to authors by readers. This was the type of commenting that was present; commenting is reminiscent of the older practice of publishing&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_to_the_editor">letters to the editor.</a>&nbsp;With the advent of technology and online platforms plus the death of penmanship, the whole concept of —<em> letters to the editor</em> — have taken on the form of online commentary via enabling comments. </p>
<p>The first online website to offer a comments section was <a href="https://www.opendiary.com/">Open Diary</a>, which added reader comments shortly after its launch in October 1998. As the concept of analytics came to the fore, and a larger audience created greater brand value, which resulted in more sales, more and more companies embraced online commenting.</p>

<p>Towards the late 2000s, comments sections were quickly added to news sites. And, it was <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17512786.2016.1205954?journalCode=rjop20">between 2007 and 2008 that there was a 42% growth</a> in the number of popular news sites with comments sections. In 2008, 75% of the top 100 most popular newspapers in terms of circulation had commenting systems in place. However, towards 2010, The American Journalism Review posited that newspapers offer <a href="https://www.monsterinsights.com/what-is-gated-content-and-how-to-use-it-to-get-more-leads/">gated comments</a> or do away with comments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This evolution of commenting is the sign of the times. Many have agonized over the value of the conversations taking place online, but we see with the influx of social media platforms and blogging really taking off that online commenting is here to stay.</p>
<p>Building a commenting system where people would have to comment as their real selves, or moderating a commenting system where people were allowed to continue commenting under a different identity, has become an issue concerning the allocation of resources for many.</p>
<h2>The Future of Online Commenting has to Deal with Current Issues</h2>
<p>Online commenting and those who are privy to the world of such interactions are well aware of the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/03/10-years-of-comment-moderation/553136/">mental toll that it could have</a>. While most commenting systems do offer the facility of pre-moderation, where all incoming comments are queued to await approval, this seems to be effective only to a certain degree.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amp/2019-05-03-turn-off-comments-wont-fix-internet.html">Dr. Gina Masullo Chen</a>, assistant professor in the School of Journalism at the University of Texas at Austin, states, <em>“I would rather use techniques that will improve the comment stream…and some of the things that improve them are really strong moderation and pre-moderation.”</em> That said there is no doubt that moderators face a serious mental toll in embracing this as a full-time job. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona">The Trauma Floor</a>&nbsp;showcases the issues faced by Facebook moderators, and it is harrowing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides the mental toll that moderating online comments has on its gatekeepers, there is also the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/09/future-propaganda-will-be-computer-generated/616400/?utm_source=pocket&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=pockethits">specter of misinformation</a> that is looming large and terrifying. We have all heard of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-scandal-fallout.html">the Cambridge Analytica debacle</a>, and now we are faced with so much of disinformation spreading via online comments.</p>
<p>In a world that is teeming with so much of <a href="https://api-nationalgeographic-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/api.nationalgeographic.com/distribution/public/amp/science/2020/09/coronavirus-origins-misinformation-yan-report-fact-check-cvd?amp_js_v=a2&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D#aoh=16005082450055&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s">fake news, like, for instance, regarding Covid-19</a>, it comes as no surprise that organizations desire to one-up their competitors. With a sea chockfull of content, <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/is-facebook-organic-reach-dead/">organic reach appears to be dying</a>; this is certainly the case with Facebook. This is precisely why aspects like influencer marketing works where brands piggyback on the followers of influencers. </p>
<p>We hear of entities like <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/microsofts-ai-team-release-a-bot-that-can-generate-fake-comments-the-internet-asks-why">Bizarrely</a>, which is a team at Microsoft that has released work on an AI bot, called DeepCom. This initiative used to generate fake comments about news articles. This is the other side of the coin: While technology serves to solve certain problems, there are companies that will utilize technology to generate money. The intention is what counts at the end of the day.</p>

<p>Considering the various online facts regarding the aspect of commenting, you will realize that there are many issues concerning comments so much so that companies like <a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-verge/">Verge has done away with online comments</a>. News sites are known to be a nefarious cesspit of human thoughts. Yet, the question remains: Does getting rid of comments affect a site’s engagement and followership? It does, and yet there are outliers like the <a href="https://amp-theatlantic-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/371862/?usqp=mq331AQHKAFQCrABIA%3D%3D&amp;amp_js_v=0.1#aoh=16023963115219&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2014%2F06%2Finternet-comments-and-perceptions-of-quality%2F371862%2F">National Journal</a> that saw page views increase.</p>
<p>Instead of doing away with online commenting, why not have real-time automated feedback as a solution? Instead of focusing on that age-old advice of <strong>Never Read The Comments</strong>, let’s focus on a solution. Commenting platforms aim to keep toxic conversations stifled with a combination of human guardians and up-to-date technology.</p>
<h2>Is the Future of Online Commenting Driven by AI? </h2>
<p>The future is here. <a href="https://micky.com.au/instagram-ai-automatically-hides-offensive-comments/?amp">Instagram is already on the way to using AI</a> to identify and block offensive comments. AI will also remind users that they are typing something offensive. AI tools work to flag and categorize harmful comments before a human can review them, thus helping to manage the workload and decrease toxic content. While there’s a possibility to dance around the edges of algorithmic detection, the fact is that this is better than nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question of impartiality needs to be answered. Esther Berg’s opines that Instagram has <a href="https://nypost.com/article/social-media-censorship-conservatives/">unfairly silenced conservative thoughts</a>. Although this factor is not addressed in the article, one wonders whether this particular intervention was human or non-human. There is something known as <strong>adaptive behavior</strong>, which ultimately is one of the main concerns in designing AI-focused commenting systems. Basically, commenters can ultimately amend the word. For example, if <strong>chocolate</strong> is a banned word, it could be written as <strong>c h o c o l a t e</strong>.</p>
<p>Either way, the fact here is that AI is the future, and <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/ai-statistics/#gref">there are plenty of statistics to prove this</a>. By 2025, the global AI market is expected to be almost&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/top-industries-getting-revolutionised-by-artificial-intelligence-686a440857c0">$60 billion</a>. Moreover, the number of AI startups grew&nbsp;14 times over the last two decades. A comfortable prediction would be that commenting systems will be powered by AI yet with a human overseer. </p>
<p>Just like any technology that is used, the main stakeholders of that particular technology is human. Catering to humans is only possible with humans. AI has come a long way for sure, yet what is missing is the gap between the understanding that lies between both AI and man.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Humans are still the best when it comes to reading, understanding, interpreting and moderating content. Because of this, businesses that are focused on making their mark in the world will make use of both AI and humans when creating an online presence and moderating content online.</p>
<h2>Privacy is a BIG Issue </h2>

<p>Many news sites and blogs have chosen to go on a digital dieting strategy with regard to the endeavor of online commenting. This is because while there are too many issues with toxic commentary, there’s also the <a href="https://www.itworldcanada.com/blog/the-endless-story-of-wordpress-plugins-security-issues/431784">issue of </a><strong><a href="https://www.itworldcanada.com/blog/the-endless-story-of-wordpress-plugins-security-issues/431784">Privacy</a></strong><a href="https://www.itworldcanada.com/blog/the-endless-story-of-wordpress-plugins-security-issues/431784"> that needs to be considered</a>.</p>
<p>Most websites and blogs use a third party commenting system. Suffice to say, the focus of a commenting system is to initiate better conversations. However, the issue here is that systems like <a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/move-away-from-disqus/">Disqus and Facebook Comments track visitors</a>, and harvest their data for advertising purposes. Adding insult to injury, these systems even have the <a href="https://www.perl.com/article/104/2014/7/29/Your-users-deserve-better-than-Disqus/">indiscrete ability to know what sites users have visited</a>. What is ironic here is that <a href="https://www.perl.com/article/104/2014/7/29/Your-users-deserve-better-than-Disqus/">many companies blindly use these systems</a> at the expense of privacy. Therefore, choosing a GDPR-compliant system is key. </p>
<p>Data that is tracked by Disqus, which may be revealed to third parties, includes pseudonymous analytics data, which inclides a user’s IP address, their web browser version and installed add-ons, and their referring pages and exit links.</p>
<p>Disqus has also been criticized for <a href="http://www.baekdal.com/insights/the-first-rule-of-privacy">publishing its registered users’ entire commenting history</a>, along with a list of connected blogs and services, on the publicly viewable user profile pages. Of course, there are other issues, too, like the fact that such a system is heavy and can lead to a decrease in page load speed. </p>
<p>Exactly why is data privacy important? It is important to consumers because a breach of personal information can damage an individual’s fundamental rights and freedoms, including the risk of identity theft and other types of fraud.</p>
<p>To maintain customer trust today, a company must demonstrate that&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.netwrix.com/2019/08/08/data-privacy/">data privacy</a>&nbsp;is one of its core values. Indeed, while many businesses still view privacy policies as a forgettable legal routine, there is a change in the consumer’s attitude. <a href="https://blog.netwrix.com/2019/11/05/data-privacy-trends-issues-and-concerns-for-2020/">Worryingly, as per a PwC research, only 25%</a> of consumers believe most companies handle their personal data responsibly.</p>

The Lost Chapter<br>
<span color="#A0A0A0">Recovered conversations from 2004 shine new light on Facebook's origins.</span></p><div>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Authoritas-Students-Admissions-Founding-Facebook/dp/1606690000/ref=ed_oe_h"><img src="http://www.aarongreenspan.com/authoritas/en_US/title.gif"></a></p><p><b>UPDATE:</b> See the January 2019 <a href="https://www.plainsite.org/realitycheck/facebook.html" target="_new">Facebook, Inc. Reality Check report on PlainSite</a>, as well as my <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/d434d37f-c020-44b4-bda8-11bbad29ac58" target="_new">June 2019 testimony before UK Parliament's DCMS Sub-Committee on Disinformation</a>.</p><p>Chapter 30: The Other Folder</p><p><b>2003: Cambridge, Massachusetts</b></p><p>In college, my computer's filing system was relatively straightforward: I had a folder for each year of school, and within each of those folders there were additional folders for each course I was taking. For everything else—birthday cards for my family, funny or strange conversations with friends, documents from the College administration, and summer housing—there was the "Other" folder.</p><p>So it happened that in my junior year of college, I came across the web site of one of the many finals clubs on campus, the Fly Club. I wasn't even close to being a member of any of the clubs, but the Fly Club was of particular interest because it effectively sat on my front lawn, directly in front of Lowell House, where I'd walk back and forth in front of it to go to class every day, several times a day, without ever having seen the inside. (<a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=The+Fly+Club,+Cambridge,+MA+02138&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=42.371103,-71.118104&amp;spn=0.001494,0.002401&amp;sll=42.371031,-71.118166&amp;sspn=0.001494,0.002401&amp;t=h&amp;hq=The+Fly+Club,&amp;hnear=Cambridge,+Massachusetts+02138&amp;z=19&amp;iwloc=A)" target="_new">It's still there</a>.)</p><p>At the time, the Fly's web site had a minor glitch. As an exclusive social club open only to the elite of the elite, there wasn't much for the "average" visitor such as myself to do. On the home page, members could sign in, while everyone else could simply stare at a large picture of the building that they were politely denied access to. I wasn't interested in gaining access so much as I was curious why access was denied in the first place. But even the most exclusive buildings have back doors.</p><p>Asking my web browser to display the address of the image of the building revealed that it was unsurprisingly in the /images folder. And asking my web browser to see if there was anything else in that folder revealed that there was: a PDF comprising a directory of the Club's still-living members dating back to 1923.</p><p>I thought about it for a while, and then decided to e-mail someone I knew in the Club to inform him of the problem and to offer my services in fixing it. He replied thanking me, and that was the last I heard about it. Though I did not deliberately save the PDF to my hard drive at first, eventually I did, afraid that without it, there would be no proof that I had ever found the problem in the first place, should the matter ever come up again. I saved the file to my Other folder, and there it sat for nine years.</p><p><b>2012: Palo Alto, California</b></p><p>Quora is a Silicon Valley startup, founded by Adam D'Angelo and Charlie Cheever, both so-called Facebook veterans (a phrase that actual veterans might find laughable). Adam was Facebook's founding CTO after graduating from CalTech, and Charlie was one of Facebook's early employees after graduating from Harvard. Both are smart, down-to-earth, driven, and relatively quiet guys. Both managed to generate an enormous amount of investor, media, and user interest for Quora, though most of the users today still seem to be confined to Silicon Valley types (which should make it unsurprising that I have an account). And both founders are now at the center of a growing mystery after Adam unilaterally announced on September 11, 2012 that Charlie would no longer be involved in his day-to-day role at the company.</p><p>Several articles, none of them particularly insightful, were written about this minor drama. One of them mentioned that while at Harvard, Charlie had been the President of the Fly Club, which got me wondering—was that really true? So I began to think whether I might be able to answer the question for myself without the confounding factors of rumor and speculation. With a few clicks, I decompressed my Other folder from my junior year of college, and found the Fly Club's 2001 PDF. It confirmed that Charlie was indeed a member of the Club in 2001. And then I noticed some other files—several dated files, all ending with "zuckerberg.html."</p><p><a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/timeline.pdf" target="_new"><img src="http://www.thinkpress.com/shared/icons/pdf.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="PDF"></a> <a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/timeline.pdf" target="_new">The Complete Timeline</a></p><p><a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040108.zuckerberg.html" target="_new"><img src="http://www.thinkpress.com/shared/icons/aim.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="AIM"></a> <a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040108.zuckerberg.html" target="_new">20040108.zuckerberg.html</a><br><a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040409.zuckerberg.html" target="_new"><img src="http://www.thinkpress.com/shared/icons/aim.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="AIM"></a> <a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040409.zuckerberg.html" target="_new">20040409.zuckerberg.html</a><br><a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040420.zuckerberg.html" target="_new"><img src="http://www.thinkpress.com/shared/icons/aim.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="AIM"></a> <a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040420.zuckerberg.html" target="_new">20040420.zuckerberg.html</a><br><a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040524.zuckerberg.html" target="_new"><img src="http://www.thinkpress.com/shared/icons/aim.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="AIM"></a> <a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040524.zuckerberg.html" target="_new">20040524.zuckerberg.html</a><br><a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040602.zuckerberg.html" target="_new"><img src="http://www.thinkpress.com/shared/icons/aim.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="AIM"></a> <a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040602.zuckerberg.html" target="_new">20040602.zuckerberg.html</a></p><p>•</p><p>It turns out that my Other folder contained some of the most important legal evidence regarding the origins of Facebook, Inc. that I had been trying to find for years, but without much success. I had already scoured the folders I created for the Student Entrepreneurship Council and come up with a number of the AOL Instant Messenger conversations that I had with Mark, but not all of them, and not the most revealing ones. I had also checked my "Aaron" folder, which had another sub-folder for Instant Messenger conversations, as well as the large hierarchy of folders containing all of Think Computer Corporation's data, which had even more conversations, but none with Mark. The conversations I remembered having, but could not recall the exact details of, were nowhere to be found, at least until September 12, 2012.</p><p>What Mark and I talked about in the months before and after Facebook's launch is remarkably relevant both for its historical and present value. There is almost as much significance in what was not said as what was.</p><p>For starters, it's striking how different the context is between the way these conversations portray the beginning of Facebook, and how the opening scenes of The Social Network portray the beginning of Facebook. Long after Mark's angry blog posts that spawned Facemash, there was no talk of girlfriends or breakups, and no talk of finals clubs (even though one indirectly led me back to the conversations themselves). In other words, as we already knew, Ben Mezrich <a href="http://www.aarongreenspan.com/writing/essay.html?id=71">invented material out of whole cloth</a> for his book (upon which the movie was based), and <a href="http://www.aarongreenspan.com/writing/essay.html?id=76">profited enormously</a> from calling it "non-fiction." He did so mostly at the expense of Mark's high school friend (and later, Quora co-founder) Adam D'Angelo and myself. When the book and then the movie came out, only Adam had Facebook's imprimatur to protect his reputation.</p><p>Rather, the real key to Mark's interest in social networking can be found in the first ten lines of our first conversation: AIM screennames. Using Adam's BuddyZoo, which allowed users to determine their connections to other AIM users, Mark determined the shortest path between his screenname and mine. But we each independently realized that AIM was startlingly deficient insofar as the software encouraged users to customize their profiles, and then limited them from doing so. There was far more potential than what AIM allowed in its small text box, which is why I had immediately added an AIM screenname field to my Facebook along with a field for cell phone number, and Mark was thinking about building the exact same thing—only with Adam's BuddyZoo built in.</p><p>It's also remarkable just how close Mark and I seemed at the beginning, even after just meeting each other, which might help explain why I felt so deeply wounded in the ensuing months and years. Mark repeatedly requested, and I repeatedly offered, help with his (and even Adam's) project; after all, he didn't know much about computer hardware, and he knew almost nothing about business or legal matters. This is not to say that he wasn't smart, because he was certainly a quick learner. Yet almost from the outset, despite acting in an otherwise friendly manner, Mark determined not that he wanted to help me in return, but that he wanted to compete with me.</p><p>Serious competition between friends, in my experience, never works well, and always ends badly. Someone is bound to get hurt. In this case that person was obviously me. Mark's brand of competition, though, was more pernicious than your average sort. Rather than building a site with the same functionality as the houseSYSTEM Facebook, he built a site with the same functionality as the houseSYSTEM Facebook (as he himself admitted) that he called, without ever informing me of his intent to do so, The Facebook. It wasn't "Mark's Facebook." It wasn't "A Facebook." It was "The Facebook." As the operator of another product that people were already calling the exact same thing, that automatically put me on the defensive, because his choice of a generic name necessarily implied uniqueness and stature. His eagerness to take his work to <i>The Crimson</i> to be broadcast campuswide, made this seemingly minor problem a major one, especially when other campus newspapers nationwide, and then mainstream newspapers, picked up the story.</p><p>For a college student in 2003, I understood an awful lot about trademarks, including the general reasons why one could not trademark a generic term. I had spent five years fighting two companies over the right to name my company Think Computer—a battle I eventually won in 2004. But it came at a great expense in terms of both time and money, and I was shocked that Mark would trample on the name of someone he had just met in the dining hall over dinner three days before. It was an expense I simply could not afford all over again (unlike the Winklevoss twins, my father did not have millions of dollars of disposable income), besides which I couldn't wrap my head around the idea of getting into a legal battle with another student who apparently looked up to me and sat next to me in a Computer Science independent study. So I asked Mark about it after class one day. He denied doing anything wrong, acting wounded by the question instead. Either he was faking it, or he truly didn't understand what he was doing. Perhaps it was a little of both.</p><p>It had already been clear from our first bite of rubber chicken in Kirkland House that there were a lot of things Mark didn't understand, aside from intellectual property. He didn't understand how to speak like a mature person his age. He didn't understand why his earlier creation, Facemash, might have offended people (including me). He didn't really understand why anyone would be interested in a site as useful as houseSYSTEM. And he shockingly did not understand why information …</p></div></div>

<p>Imagine moving to a neighborhood and finding that suddenly, your friends and family are ashamed of you. Employers turn you down when you tell them your address, your fiancee tells you her family is threatening to disown her if she marries you.</p>
<p>It sounds like a literary allegory for racism, but for 2-3 million people known as <em>burakujyumin</em> in Japan, it’s a historic precedent. <em>Burakumin</em> were once part of a broader despised caste, but now refers increasingly to sections of cities where that caste once lived, and the jobs that caste once had.</p>

<p>Particularly, leather tanning and butchering. An American researcher in Japan took a job in a leather working factory, and tells this story:</p>
<blockquote><p>“On the evening before I was to head off to my first day at the factory, I had received an olfactory warning from my 82-year-old neighbor, friend, and frequent dinner companion. The stench of leather, Nakajo-san explained, was atrocious. More than that, the smell of leather stuck – it clung to your clothes, to your hands, to your hair. While the odor might wash off initially, after time, after daily contact with the scent, the smell became part of you. I needed to be prepared to stink – and stink permanently – if I were really going to work in the factory. I also, and here Nakajo-san grew a bit more serious, needed to be prepared to eat dinner alone. He explained that he could not&nbsp;abide the smell of leather and that our shared evening meals would have to end.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Some employees of banks have reported managers holding up maps of <em>burakumin</em>&nbsp;(“hamlet”) neighborhoods, warning the agents not to discriminate against people from those areas. One former clerk tells the story of a manager who delivered this speech, saying it was useful to know these neighborhoods so the agents could brace themselves to hide their disgust when they saw them. The intent was clear: “This is the map of people we don’t want to give loans to… but don’t discriminate… but check this map. You know, to <em>make sure you don’t discriminate</em> against the disgusting people who live there.”</p>
<p><strong>Defining Japan<br>
</strong>Japanese people are essentially identical to Koreans in origin, but a history of nationalism, represented by a divine emperor, has placed an imaginary sense of distinction into the blood of many Japanese. The cultural identities of some Japanese are distinct from this “pure blood” of the mainland: <em>Ainu</em> of Hokkaido and the Okinawan people have historically been considered Pseudo-Japanese, just above foreign residents of Japan. (Even multi-generational Korean migrant families are considered pseudo-Japanese). The Ainu have their own religion and ceremonies, deemed barbaric by their occupiers, while the Okinawans were seen as half-Chinese, owing to a history as a vassal state.</p>
<p>But even being “pure” Japanese didn’t keep you from full integration. There was a caste difference. Burakumin doesn’t refer to a national identity, but to “the hamlet people” who lived in ghettos on the outskirts of the cities. Essentially, outsiders.</p>

During the Tokugawa Shogunate, society was deliberately stratified into classes. We imagine the peasants to be the lowest class in a country where samurai literally had the right to kill them for any perceived insult, but there were worse people to be than the farmers toiling for a feudal lord, and one of them is the person responsible for clearing away the bodies of humans and animals or slaughtering animals for meat or leather. They were called <em>Eta</em> – “Filthy People,” or <em>Hinen</em> – “Non-People.”</p>
<p>Eta came first, long before the Tokugawa era, and Hinen came after, a term applied to everyone on Tokugawa Ieyasu’s shit list:</p>
<blockquote><p>The term came to include beggars, panhandlers, lepers, and Eta and later evolved into an all-encompassing name for occupations such as cleaners, gardeners, falcon hackers, butchers, harbingers, comedians, gravediggers and prison guards.</p></blockquote>
<p>These jobs were considered filthy for a handful of reasons. Cleaners and gardeners were not the artisans designing the gardens, they were the ones cleaning outhouses or carrying fertilizer for the gardens. Falcon Hackers and Butchers were similar, a falcon hacker cut meat into bite-sized pieces for Imperial falcons while they are hatchlings. Notably, many of these – with the absence of comedians, who basically were accused of “working blue” – worked in proximity to the royal court. Most were considered below peasants, who were elevated above merchants (taxes were based on rice, not income) and merchants remained one step above the “outcasts.”</p>
<p>Popular stories about them circulated widely. They had dog bones in their bodies but were missing a rib. That their necks didn’t cast shadows, their sexual and excretory organs were deformed. They were subhuman in the hierarchy of Tokugawa, a distinction that lasted nearly 300 years.</p>
<p>They were banned from leaving their ghettos after sunset, banned from wearing shoes, often had to wear identifying marks on their clothing. If they spoke to anyone – usually for matters of trade – they had to get on their hands and knees. Certain haircuts were forbidden, and if they wore them, a samurai could execute them on sight.</p>
<p><strong>Common People&nbsp;</strong><br>
Tokugawa-era rules said that once you took one of these jobs, all of your descendants belonged to the same caste. So why would anyone take these jobs?</p>
<p>Desperation and tradition, as best as I can tell, but no one seems to know for certain. Horses and cows were being killed in Japan before Buddhist law banned it in the 8th century; once that law was passed an entire class of worker was legally and religiously tainted. (The further away you were from the capital, Kyoto, the more likely you were to ignore these laws: Hence, concentrations today are still focused in Kyushu and Tokyo, then the outskirts of the country).</p>
<p>One important factor was the weird (to Westerners) distinction between wealth and class. Lots of samurai were poor, despite being near the top of the social hierarchy. Hide workers were paid by<em> daimyo</em> and merchants for armor, saddles, and other leather goods, even if they weren’t respected for making them, and as with any organization in Japan, they formed their own hierarchies and fiefdoms on the outskirts of towns (hamlets) with the other undesirables: Lepers, comedians, prostitutes, beggars, all of which eventually became <em>burakumin</em>.</p>
<p>Eventually, of course, they had no choice: They could <em>only</em> work in the professions allowed to their class, a distinction useful to Tokugawa’s policies of strict social control. Everyone still got leather, and the stigma reminded riot-prone farmers that things could be worse.</p>
<p>By the last year of the Tokugawa period, 1867, we hear rumblings of a rebellion amongst the burakumin. Only 9 years earlier, a court had decided that only the unwarranted murder of <em>seven</em> Eta people could earn the death penalty, because Eta were only 1/7th human in the eyes of the court. And yet, a struggling shogun seeking new sources of revenue decided to tax them (already a questionable proposition, as of course most of them were quite poor). The Eta people near Osaka refused to pay, and responded with a letter:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are considered unclean because we dispose of animals and eat their flesh. Yet, we have heard that Westerners eat the flesh of animals as part of their daily meals, and they are treated politely here. Even here, in our own country after the ports have been opened, high-ranking people are said to have developed a taste for eating meat. Hence, we would like discrimination against us to cease by abolishing the use of the word “Eta” to describe us. If that were done, we would willingly donate the requested money even if we must dispose of all our possessions.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few years later, after the Meiji Restoration – a few years after the American Civil War – they got what they wanted. The government of Japan issued what some call “The Emancipation Proclamation” for Eta, giving them equal status and forbidding the acknowledgment of their history. It did not go well; riots in Okayama lead to Burakumin being burned in the streets. Even with their new legal status, the government was considering plans to round up Eta and force them to work in Hokkaido as farmers.</p>
<p>The name Eta eliminated, a few new ones emerged: “The New Commoners,” the “Special Kind,” which soon took on the meaning of “Different Kind,” even, briefly, “The Village People.” A surprisingly familiar attempt to govern attitudes through suggestion lead to another name, “Model Hamlet People,” and from there <em>burakumin</em> was born. Though still considered discriminatory, the word continues to be used by activists and academics, so I’m using it here.</p>
<p>Burakumin continued to work immersed in the smell of meat and hides, in abattoirs and tanneries isolated from the communities they served. These regions smelled like death. The workers smelled like death, and had for centuries. The religious stigma shifted to a social one, and then to a reflection of the neighborhoods they worked in. The idea of sub-humans remained.</p>
<p>Emancipation had a cost: Without legal distinctions, they became just another merchant class, now thrown into the same race and competition as everyone else. Socially, they couldn’t mingle with “proper” townspeople, could not marry out of their class. The only difference is that the government wasn’t involved in their repression – other people were doing it for them.</p>
<p>Burakumin could not find other work. They could not marry outside their closed impoverished communities, could not improve their social standing, despite the egalitarian meritocracy espoused in the Meiji period. This state of affairs lasted without government action for another 70 years – where the whole class of impoverished outcasts lived in forbidden and ignored neighborhoods marked by social exclusion.</p>

<p><em>“Die eta filth.” “Burakumin maggots.” “Drop atomic bombs on buraku neighborhoods.”</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-6054437144226106686" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>A few months ago, I discovered a remote code execution issue in the <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> desktop application and I reported it via their <a href="https://discord.com/security">Bug Bounty Program</a>.</p><p>The RCE I found was an interesting one because it is achieved by combining multiple bugs. In this article, I'd like to share the details.</p><h3>Why I chose Discord for the target</h3><p>I kind of felt like finding for vulnerabilities of the Electron app, so I was looking for a bug bounty program which pays the bounty for an Electron app and I found Discord. Also, I am a Discord user and simply wanted to check if the app I'm using is secure, so I decided to investigate.</p><h3>Bugs I found</h3><p>Basically I found the following three bugs and achieved RCE&nbsp;by combining them.</p><ol><li>Missing contextIsolation</li><li>XSS in iframe embeds</li><li>Navigation restriction bypass (CVE-2020-15174)</li></ol><p>I'll explain these bugs one by one.</p><h3>Missing contextIsolation</h3><p>When I test Electron app, first I always check the options of the <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/browser-window">BrowserWindow API</a>, which is used to create a browser window. By checking it, I think about how RCE can be achieved when arbitrary JavaScript execution on the renderer is possible.</p><p>The Discord's Electron app is not an open source project but the Electron's JavaScript code is saved locally with the asar format and I was able to read it just by extracting it.</p><p>In the main window, the following options are used:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>const mainWindowOptions = {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;title: 'Discord',<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;backgroundColor: getBackgroundColor(),<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;width: DEFAULT_WIDTH,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;height: DEFAULT_HEIGHT,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;minWidth: MIN_WIDTH,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;minHeight: MIN_HEIGHT,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;transparent: false,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;frame: false,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;resizable: true,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;show: isVisible,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;webPreferences: {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blinkFeatures: 'EnumerateDevices,AudioOutputDevices',<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><b>nodeIntegration: false</b></span>,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preload: _path2.default.join(__dirname, 'mainScreenPreload.js'),<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nativeWindowOpen: true,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enableRemoteModule: false,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spellcheck: true<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>};</blockquote><p>The important options which we should check here are especially <i>nodeIntegration</i> and <i>contextIsolation</i>. From the above code, I found that the <i>nodeIntegration</i> option is set to false and the <i>contextIsolation</i> option is set to false (the default of the used version) in the Discord's main window.</p><p>If the nodeIntegration is set to true, a web page's JavaScript can use Node.js features easily just by calling the <code>require()</code>. For example, the way to execute the calc application on Windows is:</p><blockquote>&lt;script&gt;<br>&nbsp; require('child_process').exec('calc');<br>&lt;/script&gt;</blockquote><p>In this time, the <i>nodeIntegration</i> was set to false, so I couldn't use Node.js features by calling the <code>require()</code> directly.</p><p>However, there is still a possibility of access to Node.js features. The <i>contextIsolation</i>, another important option, was set to false. This option should not be set to false if you want to eliminate the possibility of RCE on your app.</p><p>If the <i>contextIsolation</i> is disabled, a web page's JavaScript can affect the execution of the <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/83bb065b4f6ed512d545c46389a7fdc114c94a54/lib/renderer">Electron's internal JavaScript code on the renderer</a>, and preload scripts (In the following, these JavaScript will be referred to as the JavaScript code outside web pages).&nbsp;For example, if you override&nbsp; <code>Array.prototype.join</code>, one of the JavaScript built-in methods, with another function from a web page's JavaScript, the JavaScript code outside web pages also will use the overridden function when the <code>join</code> is called.</p><p>This behavior is dangerous because Electron allows the JavaScript code outside web pages to use the Node.js features regardless the <i>nodeIntegration</i> option and by interfering with them from the function overridden in the web page, it could be possible to achieve RCE even if the <i>nodeIntegration</i> is set to false.</p><p>By the way, a such trick was previously not known. It was first discovered in a pentest by Cure53, which I also joined in, in 2016. After that, we reported it to Electron team and the <i>contextIsolation</i> was introduced.</p><p>Recently, that pentest report was published. If you are interested, you can read it from the following link:</p><p>Pentest-Report Ethereum Mist 11.2016 - 10.2017<br><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LSsD9gzOejmQ2QipReyMXwr_M0Mg1GMH/view">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LSsD9gzOejmQ2QipReyMXwr_M0Mg1GMH/view</a></p><p>You can also read the slides which I used at a CureCon event:</p><p>The <i>contextIsolation</i> introduces the separated contexts between the web page and the JavaScript code outside web pages so that the JavaScript execution of each code does not affect each. This is a necessary faeture to eliminate the possibility of RCE, but this time it was disabled in Discord.</p><p>Now I found that the <i>contextIsolation</i> is disabled, so I started looking for a place where I could execute arbitrary code by interfering with the JavaScript code outside web pages.</p><p>Usually, when I create a PoC for RCE in the Electron's pentests, I first try to achieve RCE by using the Electron's internal JavaScript code on the renderer. This is because the Electron's internal JavaScript code on the renderer can be executed in any Electron app, so basically I can reuse the same code to achieve RCE and it's easy.</p><p>In my slides, <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/masatokinugawa/electron-abusing-the-lack-of-context-isolation-curecon-en?slide=41">I introduced</a> that RCE can be achieved by using the code which Electron executes at the navigation timing. It's not only possible from that code but there are such code in some places. (I'd like to publish examples of the PoC in the future.)</p><p>However, depending on the version of Electron used, or the <i>BrowserWindow</i> option which is set, because the code has been changed or the affected code can't be reached correctly, sometimes PoC via the Electron's code does not work well. In this time, it did not work, so I decided to change the target to the preload scripts.</p><div><p>When checking the preload scripts, I found that Discord exposes the function, which allows some allowed modules to be called via <code>DiscordNative.nativeModules.requireModule('MODULE-NAME')</code>, into the web page.</p></div><p>Here, I couldn't use modules that can be used for RCE directly, such as <i>child_process</i> module, but I found a code where RCE can be achieved by overriding the JavaScript built-in methods and interfering with the execution of the exposed module.</p><p>The following is the PoC. I was able to confirm that the calc application is popped up when I call the <code>getGPUDriverVersions</code> function which is defined in the module called "<i>discord_utils</i>" from devTools, while overriding the <code>RegExp.prototype.test</code> and <code>Array.prototype.join</code>.</p><blockquote>RegExp.prototype.test=function(){<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return false;<br>}<br>Array.prototype.join=function(){<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "calc";<br>}<br>DiscordNative.nativeModules.requireModule('discord_utils').getGPUDriverVersions();</blockquote><p>The <code>getGPUDriverVersions</code> function tries to execute the program by using the "<i>execa</i>" library, like the following:</p><blockquote>module.exports.getGPUDriverVersions = async () =&gt; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;if (process.platform !== 'win32') {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return {};<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;const result = {};<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;const nvidiaSmiPath = `${process.env['ProgramW6432']}/NVIDIA Corporation/NVSMI/nvidia-smi.exe`;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;try {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result.nvidia = parseNvidiaSmiOutput(await execa(nvidiaSmiPath, []));<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;} catch (e) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result.nvidia = {error: e.toString()};<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;return result;<br>};</p></blockquote><p>Usually the <i>execa</i> tries to execute "<i>nvidia-smi.exe</i>", which is specified in the <code>nvidiaSmiPath</code> variable, however, due to the overridden <code>RegExp.prototype.test</code> and <code>Array.prototype.join</code>, the argument is replaced to "<i>calc</i>" in the <i>execa</i>'s internal processing.</p><p>Specifically, the argument is replaced by changing the following two parts.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/blob/16feb534e818668594fd530b113a028c0c06bddc/lib/parse.js#L36">https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/blob/16feb534e818668594fd530b113a028c0c06bddc/lib/parse.js#L36</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/blob/16feb534e818668594fd530b113a028c0c06bddc/lib/parse.js#L55">https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/blob/16feb534e818668594fd530b113a028c0c06bddc/lib/parse.js#L55</a></p><p>The remaining work is to find a way to execute JavaScript on the application. If I can find it, it leads to actual RCE.</p><h3>XSS in iframe embeds</h3><p>As explained above, I found that RCE could happen from arbitrary JavaScript execution, so I was trying to find an XSS vulnerability. The app supports the autolink or Markdown feature, but looked like it is good. So I turned my attention to the iframe embeds feature. The iframe embeds is the feature which automatically displays the video player on the chat when the YouTube URL is posted, for example.</p><p>When the URL is posted, Discord tries to get the <a href="https://ogp.me/">OGP</a> information of that URL and if there is the OGP information, it displays the page's title, description, thumbnail image, associated video and so on in the chat.</p><p>The Discord extracts the video URL from the OGP and only if the video URL is allowed domain and the URL has actually the URL format of the embeds page, the URL is embedded in the iframe.</p><p>I couldn't find the documentation about which services can be embedded in the iframe, so I tried to get a hint by checking the CSP's <i>frame-src</i> directive. At that time, the following CSP was used:</p><blockquote>Content-Security-Policy: [...] ; frame-src https://*.youtube.com https://*.twitch.tv https://open.spotify.com https://w.soundcloud.com https://sketchfab.com https://player.vimeo.com https://www.funimation.com https://twitter.com https://www.google.com/recaptcha/ https://recaptcha.net/recaptcha/ https://js.stripe.com https://assets.braintreegateway.com https://checkout.paypal.com https://*.watchanimeattheoffice.com</blockquote><p>Obviously, some of them are listed to allow iframe embeds (e.g. YouTube, Twitch, Spotify).&nbsp;I tried to check if the URL can be embeded in the iframe by specifying the domain into the OGP information one by one and tried to find XSS on the embedded domains. After some attempts, I found that the&nbsp;<a href="https://sketchfab.com/">sketchfab.com</a>, which is one of the domains listed in the CSP, can be embedded in the iframe and found XSS on the embeds page.&nbsp;I didn't know about Sketchfab at that time, but it seems that it is a platform in which users can publish, buy and sell 3D models. There was a simple DOM-based XSS in the footnote of the 3D model.</p><p>The following is the PoC, which has the crafted OGP. When I posted this URL to the chat, the Sketchfab was embedded into the iframe on the chat, and after a few clicks on the iframe, arbitrary JavaScript was executed.</p><p><a href="https://l0.cm/discord_rce_og.html">https://l0.cm/discord_rce_og.html</a></p><blockquote>&lt;head&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta property="og:title" content="RCE DEMO"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[...]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta property="<span><b>og:video:url</b></span>" content="https://<span><b>sketchfab.com</b></span>/models/2b198209466d43328169d2d14a4392bb/embed"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta …</blockquote></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>From the moment&nbsp;we log onto the internet, we get bombarded with dozens, if not hundreds of digital ads. Ads for shoes, shirts, vacations, productivity tools, medicine, political campaigns, mortgages, even ads for next generation military helicopters, <a href="http://worlddefenseshow.com/">weapons conferences</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/sponsored-content/2020/06/the-digital-battlespace">“digital battlespace” management</a>, and <a href="http://pnclassaction.com/">class action lawsuits</a>.
</p><p>A <a href="https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2019/02/internet-users-spend-more-than-a-quarter-of-their-lives-online.html">2019 report</a> found that the average internet user spends more than a quarter of their life (nearly seven hours per day) on the internet, through a combination of mobile, desktop, and other devices at work and at home. A typical user might see several <a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/how-many-websites-do-you-visit-each-day/">dozen to several thousand</a> web pages per day. Given how much time we spend staring at computer or smartphone screens, it is no surprise that advertisers devote much of their efforts to getting a piece of our attention through said screens.</p><p>So how many ads does a typical internet user see per day? Estimates vary greatly, with some clocking in at <a href="https://ppcprotect.com/how-many-ads-do-we-see-a-day/">20,000 per day.</a> One might question what these companies are getting out of bombarding users with so many ads. After all, many <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/brain-memory-magic-number/story?id=9189664">psychology experiments</a> have shown that our short-term memory can hold only a limited number of separate items. The average is about 7 items, plus or minus 2, depending on the context and individual. There is also the issue of relevance - more than <a href="https://www.audienceproject.com/blog/key-insights/new-study-has-ad-blocking-peaked/">half of online </a>users find that the online ads they see are irrelevant. This has been partly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/augustinefou/2020/08/18/the-cost-performance-paradox-of-modern-digital-marketing/#200ee9e82a9c">attributed</a> to problems with inaccurate audience targeting data.</p><p>I decided to conduct an exploratory experiment and monitor how many Google display and banner ads I saw over the course of a single month of browsing activity. I used the <a href="https://adalytics.io/">Adalytics browser extension</a> to keep track of all my ad data to determine:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>How many different advertisers are paying for ads to get my attention?&nbsp;</li><li>What types of ads do I see most often?&nbsp;</li><li>What proportion of the ads I saw were relevant or useful to me?</li></ul><h2>How many different ads did I see?</h2><p>Over the course of one month in 2020, I saw a total 4,975 ads across the 35 different websites I visited. Of these 4,975 ads, there were 397 unique advertisement sponsors.
</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_vIEXkuoBoDNmlwPi/assets/GFrlzaKOjOsSUQfE.png" alt="top-ads-barchart.png"></p><p><i>How many times did I see an ad from a particular advertiser?</i></p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_vIEXkuoBoDNmlwPi/assets/HSYRJBmnMukLbOcm.png" alt="top-ads-wordcloud.png"></p><p><i>Word cloud of advertisers whose ads I saw most frequently</i></p><h2>One advertiser showed me their ads over 2,000 times within the course of one month</h2><p>I was surprised by the large number of ads I got from the online lending marketplace LendingTree. Almost 40% of the ads I saw were from their company, for a grand total of 2,081 ads. Upon closer inspection, I realized that I had been reading an article on a statistics website and left the browser tab open for a day (but not in view). This particular website would unload and load new ads from Google and Pubmatic’s ad networks every 15-20 seconds - an ‘interesting’ practice that allows a publisher like the website displaying this LendingTree ad to garner a larger number of ad impressions (and revenue) per each site visit. This practice wastes a user’s network data and can also slow down browser performance.This situation illustrates a broader phenomenon - the AdChoices program was created partially in response to the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) taking a closer look at the digital advertising industry in 2009. The resulting initiative was designed as a self-regulatory mechanism by the adtech platforms, but those platforms may have little financial interest in creating tools that enable users to reduce how many irrelevant ads they are shown. It is therefore unsurprising that <a href="https://www.audienceproject.com/blog/key-insights/insights-attitude-towards-advertising-use-ad-blocking/">eliminating irrelevant ads</a> has become one of the top drivers of ad blocker adoption.</p><p>A recent r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/ir3247/if_the_same_ad_is_served_on_a_given_webpage_500/">Ad Operations</a> discussion confirmed that LendingTree most likely is getting charged for this multitude of ‘unseen’ impressions. Advertisers can utilize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_capping">frequency capping</a> to reduce the number of times a website visitor is shown the same ad and blacklist websites that inflate their impression counts through such means.</p><p>Disregarding this one problematic website, LendingTree was still the dominant purveyor of ads to my browser - 162 distinct impression loads. I discussed in another blog post how the Digital Advertising Alliance (which includes Google) created a self-regulatory initiative called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdChoices">AdChoices</a>, which in theory allows consumers to opt-out of seeing a specific ad multiple times by clicking on a blue triangle icon in the top right corner of an ad iframe. However, I showed in that exploratory analysis that a majority of ads do not include the AdChoices icon within their iframes, thus preventing users from opting out of seeing a specific ad unless they install an ad blocker. At the time this analysis was conducted, a majority of LendingTree’s ads that were observed neither included the AdChoices icon nor provided an opt-out mechanism upon clicking. In the latter case, the Blue AdChoices icon would simply take me to a <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/1660762">Google Ads FAQ</a> that talks about Google’s Ad Personalization. At the time this blog post was written, I noticed that some of LendingTree’s ad do include a seemingly functional AdChoices icon that lets you opt-out of seeing their ads - the only problem is, after clicking this button and navigating to a new page, I would still see the same Lending Tree ads. Therefore, there was no way for me to indicate that I was not interested in LendingTree’s ads for the 2000th time, short of tweeting at their Marketing Team. (I will update this blog post if we get a response.)</p><h2>Breakdown of ads by category</h2><p>I used the <a href="https://www.iab.com/guidelines/taxonomy/">Interactive Advertising Bureau’s (IAB) Content Taxonomy</a> to categorize each ad I was shown and see what types of ads were most common. Categorizing the 397 unique advertisements showed 27 different IAB categories represented in this sample. Of these, “Technology &amp; Computing” ads were the most common, while “Shopping” and “Food &amp; Drink” were surprisingly under-represented in terms of the number of distinct advertisers.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_vIEXkuoBoDNmlwPi/assets/kGIMdiYyuoYKRLJg.png" alt="ads-by-category.png"></p><p><i>Pie chart illustrating the relative frequency with which I saw different categories of ads. Technology, business, and automative ads dominated.</i></p><p>I also had a fair number of different “Automotive” related ads showing up, both for cars as well as car insurance. I would broadly consider this category to be irrelevant to me, as I do not own a car nor want to own one. Showing car insurance ads to someone without a car does not seem to match the aspirational marketing maxim of “right person at the right time.”</p><h2>How many ads were relevant?</h2><p>Lastly, I sat down and reviewed the different unique ads I saw and labeled them as ‘relevant/useful’ or ‘not relevant’. This was obviously a very subjective exercise but an important one nonetheless. Irrelevant ads hurt user’s digital experience and they waste advertisers’ time and money. Entire industries have been built on personal data collection and the promise of marketing personalization, so this exercise was meant to serve as a very rough proxy for the success of that vision.</p><p>When labeling ads as ‘relevant’, I tried to be fairly open minded and include things that I’m not in the market for right now, but might be at some point in the next few years, such as replacement running shoes. I also included public awareness ads, such as those for coronavirus.gov or the public health initiative alonetogether.com. Of the 397 unique advertisers whose ads I saw (including multiple different products or ad copies), I decided 32 of them were relevant. The majority of these were for technology services, such as the cloud software monitoring company sonraisecurity.com, news related items (like a Bloomberg subscription or Politico sponsored articles), or coupon services. I got several ads for products I already purchase, such as TDAmeritrade’s brokerage services or Cloud Guru’s online tech education service. However, ads for things like <a href="http://covance.com/">Convance’s</a> contract clinical trial services, car insurance, coding bootcamps, or <a href="https://ncgmarketing.com/">digital marketing for attorneys</a> were not things I would ever need.</p><p>I saw these 32 ‘relevant’ ads a total of 666 times (auspicious, I know), and saw irrelevant ads 4,309 times. Excluding that one problematic website that served me thousands of LendingTree and other ads, reduces the irrelevant ads frequency total to 1867, or 74%.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Based on this small sample size analysis and accounting for the outlier of one website, I saw ~85 Google display ads per day. The majority of them (74%) were not relevant to me, and in most cases I did not have a way to opt-out of seeing them any more. I did get some ads from companies that were offering relevant products or services that I looked into further; some of these companies paid for more than 100 impressions to grab my attention, which underscores how some marketing strategies espouse a high number of touchpoints to interest a customer.</p><p>The example of LendingTree’s ad barrage, both on that one particularly problematic website, as well as on other sites, highlights how a lack of opt-out mechanisms and frequency capping can hurt consumers, and perhaps advertisers as well.</p><h2>Take away points</h2><ul><li>The proportion of ads shown to users that are relevant can be as low as 25%, probably even lower</li><li>A small number of advertisers can account for a disproportionately large portion of ad content served to users</li><li>Users are often not given any way to opt-out of irrelevant ads, excepting by installing ad blockers</li></ul></div></div></div></div>]]>

<em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/">first</a></em> – <em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-9/">previous</a></em>
</span></p>

<p>Welcome back to the Compiling a Lisp series. In this thrilling new update, we
will learn a little bit more about x86-64 instruction encoding instead of
allocating more interesting things on the heap or adding procedure calls.</p>

<p>I am writing this interlude because I changed one register in my compiler code
(<code>kRbp</code> to <code>kRsp</code>) and all hell broke loose — the resulting program was
crashing, <code>rasm2</code>/Cutter were decoding wacky instructions when fed my binary,
etc. Over the span of two very interesting but very frustrating hours, I
learned why I had these problems and how to resolve them. You should learn,
too.</p>

<h3 id="state-of-the-instruction-encoder">State of the instruction encoder</h3>

<p>Recall that I introduced at least 10 functions that looked vaguely like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>Emit_mov_reg_imm32</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>Register</span> <span>dst</span><span>,</span> <span>int32_t</span> <span>src</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Buffer_write8</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>kRexPrefix</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Buffer_write8</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>0xc7</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Buffer_write8</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>0xc0</span> <span>+</span> <span>dst</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Buffer_write32</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>src</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These functions all purport to encode x86-64 instructions. They do, most of the
time, but they do not tell the whole story. This function is supposed to encode
an instruction of the form <code>mov reg64, imm32</code>. How does it do it? I don’t know!</p>

<p>They have all these magic numbers in them! What is a <code>kRexPrefix</code>? Well, it’s
<code>0x48</code>. Does that mean anything to us? No! It gets worse. What are <code>0xc7</code> and
<code>0xc0</code> doing there? Why are we adding <code>dst</code> to <code>0xc0</code>? Before this debugging
and reading extravaganza, I could not have told you. Remember how somewhere in
a previous post I mentioned I was getting these hex bytes from reading the
compiled output on the Compiler Explorer? Yeah.</p>

<p>As it turns out, this is not a robust development strategy, at least with
x86-64. It might be okay for some more regular or predictable instruction sets,
but not this one.</p>

<h3 id="big-scary-documentation">Big scary documentation</h3>

<p>So where do we go from here? How do we find out how to take these mystical
hexes and incantations to something that better maps to the hardware? Well, we
once again drag <a href="https://tchebb.me/">Tom</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> into a debugging session and pull
out the big ol’ Intel <a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-sdm.html">Software Developer Manual</a>.</p>

<p>This is an enormous 26MB, 5000 page manual comprised of four volumes. It’s
<em>very intimidating</em>. This is exactly why I didn’t want to pull it out earlier
and do this properly from the beginning… but here we are, eventually needing
to do it properly.</p>

<p>I will not pretend to understand all of this manual, nor will this post be a
guide to the manual. I will just explain what sections and diagrams I found
useful in understanding how this stuff works.</p>

<p>I only ever opened Volume 2, the instruction set reference. In that honking
2300 page volume are descriptions of every Intel x86-64 instruction and how
they are encoded. The instructions are listed alphabetically and split into
sections based on the first letter of each instruction name.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at Chapter 3, specifically at the MOV instruction on page
&nbsp; 1209. For those following along who do not want to download a massive
PDF, this <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/index.html">website</a> has a bunch
of the same data in HTML form. Here’s the <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/mov">page for
MOV</a>.</p>

<p>This page has every variant of MOV instruction. There are other instructions
begin with MOV, like MOVAPD, MOVAPS, etc, but they are different enough that
they are different instructions.</p>

<p>It has six columns:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Opcode</em>, which describes the layout of the bytes in the instruction stream.
This describes how we’ll encode instructions.</li>
  <li><em>Instruction</em>, which gives a text-assembly-esque representation of the
instruction. This is useful for figuring out which one we actually want to
encode.</li>
  <li><em>Op/En</em>, which stands for “Operand Encoding” and as far as I can tell
describes the operand order with a symbol that is explained further in the
“Instruction Operand Encoding” table on the following page.</li>
  <li><em>64-Bit Mode</em>, which tells you if the instruction can be used in 64-bit mode
(“Valid”) or not (something else, I guess).</li>
  <li><em>Compat/Leg Mode</em>, which tells you if the instruction can be used in some
other mode, which I imagine is 32-bit mode or 16-bit mode. I don’t know. But
it’s not relevant for us.</li>
  <li><em>Description</em>, which provides a “plain English” description of the opcode,
for some definition of the words “plain” and “English”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other instructions have slightly different table layouts, so you’ll have to
work out what the other columns mean.</p>

<p>Here’s a preview of some rows from the table, with HTML courtesy of Felix
Cloutier’s aforementioned web docs:</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Opcode</th>
<th>Instruction</th>
<th>Op/En</th>
<th>64-Bit Mode</th>
<th>Compat/Leg Mode</th>
<th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>88 /<em>r</em></td>
<td>MOV <em>r/m8,r8</em></td>
<td>MR</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Move <em>r8</em> to <em>r/m8.</em></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>REX + 88 /<em>r</em></td>
<td>MOV <em>r/m8</em><sup>***,</sup><em>r8</em><sup>***</sup></td>
<td>MR</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>N.E.</td>
<td>Move <em>r8</em> to <em>r/m8.</em></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>89 /<em>r</em></td>
<td>MOV <em>r/m16,r16</em></td>
<td>MR</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Move <em>r16</em> to <em>r/m16.</em></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>89 /<em>r</em></td>
<td>MOV <em>r/m32,r32</em></td>
<td>MR</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Move <em>r32</em> to <em>r/m32.</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>C7 /<em>0 id</em></td>
<td>MOV <em>r/m32, imm32</em></td>
<td>MI</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Move <em>imm32</em> to <em>r/m32.</em></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>REX.W + C7 /<em>0 id</em></td>
<td>MOV <em>r/m64, imm32</em></td>
<td>MI</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>N.E.</td>
<td>Move <em>imm32 sign extended to 64-bits</em> to <em>r/m64.</em></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>If you take a look at the last entry in the table, you’ll see <code>REX.W + C7 /0
id</code>. Does that look familiar? Maybe, if you squint a little?</p>

<p>It turns out, that’s the description for encoding the instruction we originally
wanted, and had a bad encoder for. Let’s try and figure out how to use this to
make our encoder better. In order to do that, we’ll need to first understand a
general layout for Intel instructions.</p>

<h3 id="instruction-encoding-big-picture">Instruction encoding, big picture</h3>

<p>All Intel x86-64 instructions follow this general format:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>optional</em> instruction prefix (1 byte)</li>
  <li>opcode (1, 2, or 3 bytes)</li>
  <li><em>if required,</em> Mod-Reg/Opcode-R/M, also known as ModR/M (1 byte)</li>
  <li><em>if required,</em> Scale-Index-Base, also known as SIB (1 byte)</li>
  <li>displacement (1, 2, or 4 bytes, or none)</li>
  <li>immediate data (1, 2, or 4 bytes, or none)</li>
</ul>

<p>I found this information at the very beginning of Volume 2, Chapter 2 (page
527) in a section called “Instruction format for protected mode, real-address
mode, and virtual-8086 mode”.</p>

<p>You, like me, may be wondering about the difference between “optional”, “if
required”, and “…, or none”. I have no explanation, sorry.</p>

<p>I’m going to briefly explain each component here, followed up with a
piece-by-piece dissection of the particular MOV instruction we want, so we get
some hands-on practice.</p>

<h4 id="instruction-prefixes">Instruction prefixes</h4>

<p>There are a couple kind of instruction prefixes, like REX (Section 2.2.1) and
VEX (Section 2.3). We’re going to focus on REX prefixes, since they are needed
for many (most?) x86-64 instructions, and we’re not emitting vector
instructions.</p>

<p>The REX prefixes are used to indicate that an instruction, which might normally
refer to a 32-bit register, should instead refer to a 64-bit register. Also
some other things but we’re mostly concerned with register sizes.</p>

<h4 id="opcode">Opcode</h4>

<p>Take a look at Section 2.1.2 (page 529) for a brief explanation of opcodes. The
gist is that the opcode is the <em>meat</em> of the instruction. It’s what makes a MOV
a MOV and not a HALT. The other fields all modify the meaning given by this
field.</p>

<h4 id="modrm-and-sib">ModR/M and SIB</h4>

<p>Take a look at Section 2.1.3 (page 529) for a brief explanation of ModR/M and
SIB bytes. The gist is that they encode what register sources and destinations
to use.</p>

<h4 id="displacement-and-immediates">Displacement and immediates</h4>

<p>Take a look at Section 2.1.4 (page 529) for a brief explanation of displacement
and immediate bytes. The gist is that they encode literal numbers used in the
instructions that don’t encode registers or anything.</p>

<p>If you’re confused, that’s okay. It should maybe get clearer once we get our
hands dirty. Reading all of this information in a vacuum is moderately useless
if it’s your first time dealing with assembly like this, but I included this
section first to help explain how to use the reference.</p>

<h3 id="encoding-piece-by-piece">Encoding, piece by piece</h3>

<p>Got all that? Maybe? No? Yeah, me neither. But let’s forge ahead anyway. Here’s
the instruction we’re going to encode: <code>REX.W + C7 /0 id</code>.</p>

<h4 id="rexw">REX.W</h4>

<p>First, let’s figure out <code>REX.W</code>. According to Section 2.2.1, which explains REX
prefixes in some detail, there are a couple of different prefixes. There’s a
helpful table (Table 2-4, page 535) documenting them. Here’s a bit diagram with
the same information:</p>

<p>In English, and zero-indexed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bits 7-4 are always <code>0b0100</code>.</li>
  <li>Bit 3 is the W prefix. If it’s 1, it means the operands are 64 bits. If it’s
0, “operand size [is] determined by CS.D”. Not sure what that means.</li>
  <li>Bits 2, 1, and 0 are other types of REX prefixes that we may not end up
using, so I am omitting them here. Please read further in the manual if you
are curious!</li>
</ul>

<p>This MOV instruction calls for REX.W, which means this byte will look like
<code>0b01001000</code>, also known as our friend <code>0x48</code>. Mystery number one, solved!</p>

<h4 id="c7">C7</h4>

<p>This is a hexadecimal literal <code>0xc7</code>. It is the <em>opcode</em>. There are a couple of
other entries with the opcode <code>C7</code>, modified by other bytes in the instruction
(ModR/M, SIB, REX, …). Write it to the instruction stream. Mystery number
two, solved!</p>

<h4 id="0">/0</h4>

<p>There’s a snippet in Section 2.1.5 that explains this notation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the instruction does not require a second operand, then the Reg/Opcode
field may be used as an opcode extension. This use is represented by the
sixth row in the tables (labeled “/digit (Opcode)”). Note that values in row
six are represented in decimal form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a little confusing because this operation clearly <em>does</em> have a second
operand, denoted by the “MI” in the table, which shows Operand 1 being
<code>ModRM:r/m (w)</code> and Operand 2 being <code>imm8/16/32/64</code>. I think it’s because it
doesn’t have a second <em>register</em> operand that this space is free — the
immediate is in a different place in the instruction.</p>

<p>In any case, this means that we have to make sure to put decimal <code>0</code> in the
<code>reg</code> part of the ModR/M byte. We’ll see what the ModR/M byte looks like in
greater detail shortly.</p>

<h4 id="id">id</h4>

<p><em>id</em> refers to an immediate <em>double word</em> (32 bits). It’s called a <em>double</em>
word because, a word (<em>iw</em>) is 16 bits. In increasing order of size, we have:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>ib</em>, byte (1 byte)</li>
  <li><em>iw</em>, word (2 bytes)</li>
  <li><em>id</em>, double word (4 bytes)</li>
  <li><em>io</em>, quad word (8 bytes)</li>
</ul>

<p>This means we have to write our 32-bit value out to the instruction stream.
These notations and encodings are explained further in Section 3.1.1.1 (page
596).</p>

<p>Overall, that means that this instruction will have the …</p></div></div>

<p>I want to take a brief look at various data serialization formats and compare them. Basically the goal is to answer the question, “can we find something better than JSON?” However, note that we are looking at these things for DATA SERIALIZATION, not for config files and stuff, so that’s the goal by which these will be judged.</p>
<p>There’s two orthogonal axes to look at these things under:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-describing vs.&nbsp;schema-defined formats</li>
<li>Human readable vs.&nbsp;machine-readable formats</li>
</ul>
<p>That is, whether the type information for a structure is defined in a separate file (a schema) that a receiving program checks against, or whether the message itself contains type information. It’s almost exactly the difference between statically and dynamically typed programming languages. Like programming languages, both have pros and cons, neither of them are always better than the other. The goal of this is to compare apples to apples, so we’re gonna note which category these things fall into but not make value judgements based on them. There’s also fuzzy edges; many self-describing formats optionally have a schema layer too. Similarly, we will not really compare tooling quality; the goal is to look at the intrinsic properties of the formats. The culture surrounding them may be considered though.</p>
<p>This is also important not to conflate with an RPC protocol, though many of these things are used IN RPC protocols. Keep in mind that HTTP/REST interfaces are often just a type of RPC protocol, whether realized that way or not.</p>
<p>Up to date as of October 2020. Doesn’t try to include myriad minor things, ’cause there’s only so much time in the world.</p>

<h2 id="json">JSON</h2>
<p><a href="http://json.org/">http://json.org/</a></p>
<p>What everything gets currently compared against. We all know JSON, we all agree it’s Sorta Good Enough but really is kinda crap.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing. (<a href="https://json-schema.org/">https://json-schema.org/</a> exists but does not seem very widely used.) Has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC">RPC protocol</a> but it also seems lightly used, <a href="https://jsonapi.org/">this</a> might be more general.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Everyone</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to major programming languages – Easy to understand and debug</li>
<li>Simple – Easy to read, write, and understand… at least for simple things. <a href="http://seriot.ch/parsing_json.php">Turns out there’s a lot of gotcha’s though.</a></li>
<li>Pretty compact if minified</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is pretty shit – no date/time, no real integers, no real structs, no unions/tuples/etc</li>
<li>Tends to discourage schema’s – “So simple it doesn’t need it”, until it becomes less simple.</li>
<li>No normalized form – fields may be reordered, <em>duplicated</em>, etc. Makes hashing it hard, gotta read whole message to begin verifying it, etc.</li>
<li>No comments – harder to write well than you might think!</li>
<li>No good way to contain binary data</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="yaml">YAML</h2>
<p><a href="https://yaml.org/">https://yaml.org/</a></p>
<p>Started out as a simpler alternative to XML.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Lots of people</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vaguely simple to read and write, in its basic form</li>
<li>Low visual noise</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Way too complicated – they made it a strict superset of JSON for some damn reason, and nobody uses that form, so it’s just a pile of wasted effort</li>
<li>Reference impl incomplete, other impl’s disagree with each other and the spec</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="xml">XML</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML</a></p>
<p>Not sure anyone really knows how XML happened. It’s basically the W3C’s fault, I think? It’s okay for some things but in the end I’m not sure it’s something anyone actually <em>wants</em> to use, it’s just going to be one more of those mistakes of the past.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing with common schema usage. Has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC">RPC protocol</a> and many other complicated things.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Everyone who can’t avoid it.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Promotes schemas and validation</li>
<li>Simple to use for simple things</li>
<li>Actually pretty decent for documents</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve never gotten schemas and validation to actually work in practice</li>
<li>Everything is string-ly typed</li>
<li>No real arrays</li>
<li>Complicated as frig</li>
<li>Very verbose</li>
<li>There’s like 3-4 different ways to do everything</li>
<li>Still no good way to contain binary data</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="protobuf">Protobuf</h2>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/</a></p>
<p>aka Protocol Buffers, but that’s a pretty dumb name. Google’s common, fast on-the-wire serialization format.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Has an <a href="https://grpc.io/">RPC protocol</a> built around it.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Google, basically everyone</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Backed by Google, so it’s going to be good at the things Google values</li>
<li>Basically reasonable</li>
<li>Now has some support for versioning schemas, though it’s a hard problem in general</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Backed by Google, so it’s going to be good at the things Google values</li>
<li>Not particularly simple</li>
<li>Wire protocol may be more work than it needs to be</li>
<li>Its type system <a href="http://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/protos-are-wrong/index.html">could maybe be better</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="capn-proto">Cap’n Proto</h2>
<p><a href="https://capnproto.org/">https://capnproto.org/</a></p>
<p>The Other Binary Serialization Protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Designed primarily for RPC, which is built in to the reference implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> sandstorm.io, Cloudflare?, various other people but it doesn’t seem like that many</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed to be fast</li>
<li>Made by one of the people who worked heavily on Protobuf at Google, so <a href="https://capnproto.org/faq.html#how-do-i-make-a-field-required-like-in-protocol-buffers">there’s lots of experience behind it</a>. That said, doesn’t mean this cat’s always <em>right</em>, but there’s certainly opinions that are trying to be expressed.</li>
<li>Sophisticated RPC comes as part of the standard package</li>
<li>Designed for zero-copy deserialization</li>
<li>Designed for schema to evolve</li>
<li>Adorable name</li>
<li>Very explicit about correctness and conformance things such as field ordering and layout</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Very explicit about correctness and conformance things such as field ordering and layout</li>
<li>Lots of the docs and concepts are pretty low level, you usually ain’t gonna need it</li>
<li>Seems more complicated than protobuf – this might be one reason there’s fewer 3rd-party implementations</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thrift">Thrift</h2>
<p><a href="https://thrift.apache.org/">https://thrift.apache.org/</a></p>
<p>Apache’s version of Protobuf. Does anyone actually use this? Facebook, apparently, since they invented it and then gave it to Apache. Anyone else?</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Designed primarily for RPC.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Basically mostly Facebook? Twitter and AirBNB also apparently use it, so apparently it’s not UNpopular.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It works?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Docs suck</li>
<li>Apache is the tragic junkyard of open source projects</li>
<li>Apparently still not as good as flatbuffers, see below</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flatbuffers">Flatbuffers</h2>
<p><a href="https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/">https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/</a></p>
<p>Feels a little like Google’s answer to Cap’n Proto, as it has some of the same design goals – zero-copy serialization and layouts that are more amenable to versioning.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Includes RPC protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Google, Cocos2D, Facebook’s mobile client</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed for zero-copy deserialization</li>
<li>Designed for schema to evolve</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kinda feels like the problem is already solved by capnp</li>
<li>Includes a JSON parser for some reason?</li>
<li>Type system is kinda anemic with regards to unions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cbor">CBOR</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbor.io/">https://cbor.io/</a></p>
<p>Basically a binary re-imagining of JSON.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> ???</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pretty good type system – there’s things like fixnum’s, datetime’s, blobs, etc</li>
<li>Compact</li>
<li>Built-in extensibility</li>
<li>Designed to be a drop-in replacement for JSON</li>
<li>IETF standard</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kinda more complicated than it needs to be, though this is for the sake of compactness and comprehensive types. Numbers are densely packed into fewer bits when possible, for example.</li>
<li>Doesn’t actually seem that widely adopted for some reason?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="msgpack">Msgpack</h2>
<p><a href="https://msgpack.org/">https://msgpack.org/</a></p>
<p>The Other CBOR, or rather, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14067747">CBOR is derived from this</a>. Designed to be simple and compact. Kinda a <em>lot</em> like a slightly chopped down CBOR, actually, their integer specification stuff looks nearly identical.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Redis, a few others?</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Compact</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Specification is kinda weak</li>
<li>No real tuple or enum types</li>
<li>Why not just CBOR?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bson">BSON</h2>
<p><a href="http://bsonspec.org/">http://bsonspec.org/</a></p>
<p>As the name implies, a binary-ifcation of JSON. Created by MongoDB as its internal data format.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> MongoDB</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is full of deprecated and MongoDB-specific shit but is reasonably pragmatic</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is reasonably pragmatic but is full of deprecated and MongoDB-specific shit</li>
<li><strong>C strings</strong> – though there’s random non-C strings in places as well.</li>
<li>Its arrays are a travesty against serializarion</li>
<li>Basically an implementation detail of MongoDB, and it looks like it</li>
</ul>

<p>Things that are interesting but not actually in the scope of serialization languages, or are otherwise irrelevant.</p>
<h2 id="toml">TOML</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">https://github.com/toml-lang/toml</a></p>
<p>Invalid, it’s designed as a config language, not a serialization format. It’s basically an attempt to make something as simple and ubiquitous as windows .INI files that is an actual specification rather than a fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, sorta self-describing though usually you have a specific data structure you’re trying to fit it into.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Various, notably Cargo (Rust’s build tool)</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Work well as a config language without deeply nested structures</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Works poorly when you try to make deeply nested structures</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ron">RON</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ron-rs/ron">https://github.com/ron-rs/ron</a></p>
<p>Rusty Object Notation. Because shoehorning Rust’s ML-y type systeminto JSON isn’t very much fun. Works startlingly well for this purpose but is basically untried elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, sorta self-describing though usually you have a specific data structure you’re trying to fit it into.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> A few, notably <a href="https://amethyst.rs/">Amethyst</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Good type system for sophisticated functional-style languages</li>
<li>Simple and reasonably compact</li>
<li>Actually very good at what it does</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Young, underspecified, Rust-centric</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bincode">Bincode</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/servo/bincode">https://github.com/servo/bincode</a></p>
<p>Included mainly for completeness. It’s not standardized outside of a single particular implementation which doesn’t promise stability, so not intended for general-purpose use. It’s intended as a fast and easy RPC/IPC format for Servo, and the actual format is basically an implementation detail of that goal.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Servo, programs written by introverts who don’t care about being able to talk to each other. (Turns out this is a useful niche though, who knew.)</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Compact, fast, simple.</li>
<li>Works basically transparently for IPC with Rust code.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Anything other than that specific version of that specific library is …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>I come across questions on how to get started in programming often. People are hungry to learn, but don’t know where to start or which path to take. This is made even more difficult these days due to a lot of different areas that exist, such as web development, mobile software development, game development etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although we live at a time when tutorials and lessons are abundant, a lot of it can feel overwhelming. What you need is a roadmap to navigate the topics. You want a structure to guide you in your learning. A lot of coding bootcamps follow an approach similar to a college curriculum. Working through these curriculums is frustrating because you don’t feel like you are learning anything substantial quickly enough. College curriculum is great if your goal is to get a certificate or a degree. They are not great if your goal is to learn the practical skills of software engineering.</p>



<p>Following is a roadmap that I have put together to help you guide yourself in learning how to program. Your mileage with this will depend on your current experience with coding. These days though, I expect a lot of people to have had some exposure to very basic coding concepts such as loops, if statements etc. Spending any more time on these concepts may not be worthwhile. What you want is a road map that gets you on your way to building things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here it is, my recommended roadmap for learning how to build software:</p>



<h2>1. Start with Web Development</h2>



<p>As I had mentioned, there are many different areas of software development that you could focus on. I recommend starting with Web Development because it has the quickest feedback loop. This will help you improve fast and learn various concepts quickly. Principles learnt here can then be applied to other areas that you may be interested in such as mobile app development or game development.</p>



<p>When learning web app programming, you will be required to pick up HTML, CSS and Javascript. These are core languages for building web apps. But what you want to spend more time and focus on is the backend server system. The backend systems are responsible for providing the data APIs that support your application. Principles that you learn building good backend systems will provide you with a strong software engineering foundation.</p>



<p>For the backend, you will primarily work with either PHP, Python, Java or Ruby. Pick any one that you feel comfortable with. I recommend Python or Ruby to start.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>2. Prioritize building an end-to-end application first</strong></h2>



<p>One of the key principles for effective learning is to focus on depth first. Instead of learning a lot of concepts across the breadth of the topics, I recommend going deep into one specific area. In this case, I suggest focusing on building a simple end-to-end application first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You will get a general idea of what it is like to build something from scratch. More importantly, you will feel great having a built a working app. The feeling of satisfaction from the progress will motivate and propel you forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At this point you are ready to unpack and dive deeper into various aspects of what you have built. </p>











<h2><strong>3. Dive deep into the principles of software architecture</strong></h2>



<p>Once you have built an end-to-end app you will find that learning a couple of frameworks and libraries will be enough to keep you going. Most coding bootcamps stop here. But this stops short of diving into the richer and more rewarding world of software engineering. </p>



<p>I recommend spending time learning software design principles, object oriented programming and various systems architecture patterns. You will learn the details of how to cleanly and effectively work with databases, how to structure your code to enable more complex systems, different design patterns and architectures. </p>



<p>Software architecture&nbsp;principles&nbsp;are timeless and will support you throughout your entire career. </p>



<p>Some great books I can recommend here are:&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321127420/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mkngsmlrcrcls-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0321127420&amp;linkId=4962a37ba12a94696993ef4f54eca9fa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132350882/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mkngsmlrcrcls-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0132350882&amp;linkId=20953e9f7d1dd550a5b402f355cfc2a1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clean Code</a></p>



<h2><strong>4. Data structure and&nbsp;algorithms are super important</strong></h2>



<p>The importance of algorithms in software engineering can be surprisingly controversial. This is perhaps due to Silicon Valley tech companies relying on them in the interview process. It’s true that many professional software developers never look back at the algorithms that they vaguely learn in college.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s unfortunate. The reality is that deep knowledge of algorithms, just like software architecture are foundational requirements if you want to excel as a software engineer at the highest level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(Check out the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201657880/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201657880&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mkngsmlrcrcls-20&amp;linkId=0eb37d6439098ac088b44d65937d4143" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Programming Pearls</a> for some great practical thinking on this).<br></p>



<hr>



<p><strong><br></strong>I hope this roadmap gives you some sense of the various aspects that you can focus on to learn programming and launch a career in software engineering. I have not provided a time estimate here since your progress will vary. Learning something new and complex takes time. If you stick with it, a rewarding career is waiting for you on the other side.</p>
