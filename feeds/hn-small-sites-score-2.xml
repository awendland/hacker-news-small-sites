<section>
    
    <article>
        <p>I've been writing on this blog for about 2 years now. This has been the longest I've stuck on to the same <em>technology stack</em> for my blog. I've previously jumped from a Jekyll based static site to a Medium blog before finally settling for <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.</p>
<p>I've been using Hugo since 2018 but I don't recall as to <em>why</em> I went ahead with it. Maybe it was increasingly popular at that time and everyone touted Hugo as <em>the</em> solution to Static Site Generator (referred to as SSG from here on). There are 1000s of SSGs and at least a dozen of websites which lists all the SSGs out there. This is crazy by any standards. Hugo started as a generic blog generator but over the years it has become a <em>website generator</em>. It's no longer aimed at people who just want to have a small little static website/blog but supports all the use cases for people building full-fledged static websites. IMHO these two goals are overarching however this has resulted in a simple project to become incredibly complex over time.</p>
<h3 id="tipping-point">Tipping Point</h3>
<p>Anyway, so I wanted to change the look of the homepage on my website so I decided to look at Hugo's documentation. Hugo's documentation is great for someone who knows what exactly are they looking for. The documentation is so huge that you simply cannot grok it in one evening. I had zero ideas on how to customise the damn homepage of my blog and after spending hours buried in the documentation I was able to kind of figure the solution but it was unintuitive, to say the least. Apparently, to override any template from the theme, you have to mirror the directory structure of the theme in your root directory. Which meant, I needed to look at the source code of the theme, figure out the project structure, copy-paste all the folder names and put my override of <code>index.html</code> there. Which, BTW <strong>magically</strong> overrides it. This whole magic thing is BS and I am being strongly opinionated here.</p>
<p>There is more than one way to do something in Hugo. Different theme authors use different styles, which makes the whole thing even more complex. It also means for my customisations to work across themes, well you guessed it right: <strong>it's impossible</strong>.</p>
<p>Recently I discovered that I was unable to preview my Hugo website locally without internet because I had a Twitter <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#tweet">shortcode</a> in one of my blog post (which makes an API call to Twitter to render a nice card preview). The site completely failed to render instead of just logging a warning. Bollocks.</p>
<p>The tipping point for me, however, was when the theme I was using stopped working with the latest version of Hugo at that point. So, picture this -- You make dozens of custom changes and then one update just <em>breaks</em> your website. Now not only you have to fix your shit but the theme you were using, you've to make upstream changes to the theme or maintain your own fork. And no, this is not a one-off experience. Hugo upgrades are a joke, they are known to break very very often.</p>
<p>I was done at this point. I didn't want to deal with this BS of continuously fighting the generator for my blog.</p>
<h3 id="a-fresh-change">A fresh change</h3>
<p>Being a practitioner of <a href="https://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html">Yak Shaving</a>, I discussed the idea of a "tinyhugo" with <a href="https://nadh.in/">Kailash</a> and <a href="https://www.saratchandra.in/">Sarat</a>. We'd arrived at a spec and I started writing some code to pander to my NIH syndrome.</p>
<p>However, I was still not convinced that a simpler solution doesn't exist. I spent countless hours exploring other alternatives. I'd used <a href="https://www.getlektor.com/">Lektor</a>, <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> before finally stumbling upon <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a> from HN/Lobster discussions. I've got to say, the landing page gave a <em>fresh</em> feeling - one that I've not seen with any other alternatives. In fact quite opposite to the Eleventy landing page which looks like an over-engineered piece of software to generate websites (Not hating on it, there might be use cases for it, but the JS tooling and dependency system is something that I would not want to touch with a 10ft pole).</p>
<p>Zola's primary appeal to me was that like Hugo it's extremely fast and comes as a single binary no dependency package. I looked at the docs the first impression was they are concise enough to get a basic idea. Zola is strongly opinionated, even to the extent of dictating a project structure and sometimes filenames too. I actually preferred this over the <em>magic</em> Hugo does. In less than 2 hours I was able to port the home page of my blog (and tweak it to my liking) in Zola. I decided to abandon my own <code>tinyhugo</code> attempt because for the very fact Zola fits my needs very well.</p>
<p>The thing that I really loved about Zola is how it enforces a separation between <a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/section/">Section</a> and <a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/page/">Pages</a>. The section represents a "collection" of posts. So a <em>blog</em> can be a section, and I can have another section called "Book Reviews". I could easily tell Zola where to look for the templates by specifying the same in <code>content/book_reviews/_index.md</code>. I don't have to read Hugo docs or do <em>Google-fu</em> to figure this out, it's right there in the docs and very apparent.</p>
<p>For the record, I still don't know how to customise different templates for different sections in Hugo, but I couldn't care less.</p>
<h3 id="migration">Migration</h3>
<p>The migration was pretty straightforward -- I had to copy the <code>content folder</code>s of my blog (which are just a bunch of <code>.md</code> fikes) and replace <code>YAML</code> frontmatter to <code>TOML</code>. There were a few variable changes that I needed to do manually but since they were a manageable 20-25 posts, I did it by hand. I could potentially automate but then rabbit deep in the rabbit hole of Yak Shaving. The good part was that I was able to retain the same URL structure for my new blog because the URL scheme was based on the file paths.</p>
<p>I spent some time porting <a href="https://github.com/knadh/hugo-ink">hugo-ink</a> to Zola and did minor CSS tweaks to it. Zola uses the Terra language for templating and it's much more pleasing to eyes than the Go Template syntax. Zola comes with pretty neat features like Search, RSS/Atom Feeds, Syntax Highlighting and SASS-&gt;CSS Processors.</p>
<p>What took me time however was to figure out how to get <code>opengraph</code> tags in each page. Hugo provides nifty <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/tpl/tplimpl/embedded/templates/opengraph.html">template</a> for this use case but Zola is pretty barebones like that. People who care a lot about SEO need to spend some extra efforts here.</p>
<h3 id="future">Future</h3>
<p>Zola is still a pretty new kid on the block but the author shares the same frustration about Hugo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it personally drives me insane, to the point of writing my own template engine and static site generator. Yes, this is a bit biased. -- <a href="https://github.com/getzola/zola#-explanations">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This also reflects in the issues/PRs I've seen for Zola and the author is opinionated about not adding features which would make Zola complicated. Overall I am very happy with the switch and it was long due. I feel more confident in tweaking certain sections of my website. I plan to open-source the current theme in the next few days.</p>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://git.mrkaran.dev/karan/website">Source Code</a> of this website if you'd like to explore how this website is built.</p>
<p>Fin!</p>

<![CDATA[Parsing the Infamous Japanese Postal CSV]]>
            </title>

November 7, 2020 | https://www.dampfkraft.com/posuto.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dampfkraft.com/posuto.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Late last year I released <a href="https://github.com/polm/posuto">posuto</a>, a package presenting Japanese postal code
data in an easy-to-use format. It's based on <a href="https://www.post.japanpost.jp/zipcode/dl/kogaki-zip.html">data released by Japan
Post</a>, which is infamous for being widely used but hard to parse.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/806ae69c/postcharacter.png"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/806ae69c/img/postcharacter.png.l.png"></a><figcaption>This adorable character by <a href="https://www.irasutoya.com/2019/08/blog-post_590.html">Irasutoya</a> is cute, but the raw postal CSV data is not.
</figcaption></figure>
<p>I first became aware of the postal data when I entered my postal code in an
online form and it auto-completed my address as "XXX-borough (except the
following buildings)". I had no idea what that parenthetical was referring to,
so I looked for a common source of postal data, found the CSV, and found the
issue.  It turns out the CSV file contains parenthetical notes for anyone
reading the CSV file and makes reference to the order of the rows.</p>
<p>This causes problems. The data is mainly useful one row at a time, where the
parenthetical is meaningless. Since CSV is a field-delimited format, there's
also no need for parentheticals - you could just add a note field.</p>
<p>This is only one of many issues with <code>ken_all.csv</code>. You can find people
complaining about it regularly <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=ken_all.csv&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">on Twitter</a>, and there was
even briefly <a href="http://ken-all.hatenadiary.com/">a blog</a> just collecting posts from all over the web
about it. A <a href="https://twitter.com/bulkneets/status/1259457777862184966">particularly amusing tweet</a> describes people who expect
computers to bend to the will of humans being punished in Hell by having to
parse <code>ken_all.csv</code> forever.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.post.japanpost.jp/zipcode/dl/readme.html">README</a> for the file explains that lines with overly long fields will be
broken up into multiple lines. Specifically, if the neighborhood name is over
38 characters, or if the half-width katakana (<em>half-width katakana</em>)
pronunciation field is over 76 characters, the line will be split into two
lines. The overly-long neighborhood field will be continued and all other
fields will be duplicated. This is an abbreviated sample of what that looks
like:</p>
<pre><code>12345,Tokyo,Minato,This place name is really
12345,Tokyo,Minato,very long it didn't fit in
12345,Tokyo,Minato,a single line so we had to 
12345,Tokyo,Minato,split it
</code></pre>
<p>The motivation for this is not explained. Maybe there was a fixed-width buffer
for storing a line somewhere thirty years ago. I used to process CSV and other
files from hundreds of different providers at an old job and I saw many
horrors, but I've never seen this particular formatting choice anywhere else.
It should also be noted that while the length limits are as stated, the
location where line breaks are inserted in long lines appears random, occurring
neither at the character limit nor at normal word boundaries.</p>
<p>It's worth noting not all the issues with the CSV are inherently technical;
postal codes are always complicated. The postal code with the most rows in the
CSV - a stunning 66 - is 〒452-0961, which refers to the <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%98%A5%E6%97%A5%E7%94%BA_(%E6%84%9B%E7%9F%A5%E7%9C%8C)">Haruhi region</a> of
Kiyosu City in Aichi Prefecture. This has that many lines because every
neighborhood gets a separate line. (This particular case may be related to Haruhi
having been the smallest town by area in Japan from 2006 until 2009, when it
was incorporated into Kiyosu City.)</p>
<p>In contrast, the longest <em>continued</em> line, using the line break rules above, is
the entry for 〒602-8368 or 〒602-8374, both with eight lines. These are both in
one of a few areas in Kyoto that uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_addressing_system#Kyoto">a unique, bizarre system of
intersection-based addressing</a>. The entry looks a bit like this:</p>
<pre><code>12345,Kyoto,Kyoto,"North Town (Up Lower Godsroad from"
12345,Kyoto,Kyoto,"the West, Down Turtle Street from the"
12345,Kyoto,Kyoto,"East, Up Old Temple Road from the"
12345,Kyoto,Kyoto,"West)"
</code></pre>
<p>I have used quoted fields here, but the actual CSV doesn't quote fields and
instead uses a different kind of comma.</p>
<p>There are other issues. There are catch-all postal codes for many areas, where
the neighborhood is given as "except the following", and the only thing to do
is look for that exact string and exclude it. There's a variety of similar
strings, and it's hard to be sure I've caught them all.</p>
<p>An example of another comment is 一円. Normally this would mean "one yen", but
it also means "the area surrounding", and is a note in the CSV that should be
removed from neighborhood names, <em>except</em> for exactly one neighborhood in Shiga where
that's actually the name (〒522-0317).</p>
<p>There's also a <a href="https://www.post.japanpost.jp/zipcode/dl/roman.html">separate romaji file</a> offered by JP Post. It's updated
less frequently than the main files, is often out of sync, and the provided
romaji are extremely low quality. For the moment I'm still providing the data
in posuto in the name of consistency, but honestly you should just use
<a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/nlp/cutlet-python-romaji-converter.html">cutlet</a>. To give an example of bad romaji:</p>
<pre><code>大手町 JAビル
OTEMACHI JIEIEIBIRU
</code></pre>
<p>What's happening here is that "JA" is being converted to the phonetic reading
in Japanese, "ジェイエイ". Then ジェ, which is written "large ji small e" but
pronounced "je", is being converted to "jie" by treating the small character as
though it were large, and the other characters are translated as-is, turning
something already in the latin alphabet into alphabet soup. For contrast,
cutlet has no problem converting "JAビル" into "JA building" (case handling
admittedly needs some work still). Similar issues turn "Roppongi Hills" into
"Roppongihiruzu", and "Sweden Hills" into "Suedenhiruzu".</p>
<p>Anyway, dealing with the file was a humbling lesson in the amount of complexity
it's possible to pack into one place. I've glossed over many details, but you
can find them covered in posuto's README.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="https://github.com/polm/posuto">posuto</a> as a library, or if you're not using Python, just
download the pre-processed JSON and make use of that. If you find a good use
for it I'd be delighted to hear about it.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you need a Win3.1 or DOS program to copy the data onto an IBM H
floppy disk, just check the bottom of <a href="https://www.post.japanpost.jp/zipcode/dl/kogaki-zip.html">JP Post's page</a> - they've
got you covered. Ψ</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Web technologies have come so far, that you realize: not everything needs to be done in JavaScript nowadays anymore.</p><blockquote><p><em>»Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.« — Confucius</em></p></blockquote><p>My initial headline would have been:</p><p><em>How I wrote more JavaScript in the backend to eliminate JavaScript in the frontend.</em></p><p>But that's already a mouthful and also would have revealed too much and you might not have clicked my slightly clickbait-y title, right?</p><p>So here is my Public Service Announcement:</p><p> 📣 <strong>This site does not use any frontend JavaScript.<sup>*</sup></strong></p><p><em><small>*) There are only tiny exceptions on 2 pages, but for a good reason. More on that later.</small></em></p><p>First of all I am not against JavaScript (<span>JS</span>) at all. If you're building a web <strong>application</strong>, then this is not only totally fine but most likely a core requirement.</p><p>But I do have my pet peeve with <span>JS</span> for plain websites and blogs. Currently there is still such a strong draught in the static site generator world, telling us all our sites should be some kind of React or other frontend framework based project (looking at you, Gatsby, Next, Nuxt, VuePress, …). That you need to have that plentyful of code running in the browser of your visitors to have a smooth and <em>feels like a native app</em> user experience. That a site should be a <em>Single Page Application (SPA).</em> I can tell you, a plain HTML+CSS website does it really well, too. Surprise!</p><p>While on one hand the browser vendors add more and more <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">Web APIs</a>, we also got a lot of improvement in the HTML and CSS area. Usually there is no big hype train around them, unless you are very enthusiastic and live in that niche.</p><p>Take a look at <a href="https://caniuse.com/">caniuse.com</a> to get an idea what is possible today and what might come tomorrow. <em>Did you know that HTML5 is still iterated on and we're moving towards <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html53/">version 5.3</a>?</em> On the other hand »HTML 5« is also used as an umbrella term for a <a href="https://spec.whatwg.org/" title="WHATWG Standards">wide variety of standards</a>. Also for CSS the story got very interesting: while CSS until 2.1 was a single specification, since CSS 3 there is a whole potpourri of recommendations and drafts. The <a href="https://wiki.csswg.org/spec">wiki of the CSS Working Group</a> might be a good starting point for further discovery.</p><p>But I want to give you some more practical examples and an experience report:</p><h2 id="sticky-navigation-bar">Sticky navigation bar</h2><p>This is something you can observe here on this blog:</p><video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline=""><source src="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/pos-sticky.hvec.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=hvc1"><source src="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/pos-sticky.hvec.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=hevc"><source src="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/pos-sticky.h264.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=avc1"><source src="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/pos-sticky.webm" type="video/webm; codecs=vp9"></video><p>The key ingredient is the CSS <code>position: sticky</code> <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-sticky">🛈</a>. Even though most of them are labeled as <em>partial support,</em> this property value can be used in most scenarios except in some table related cases. If you want a sticky menu after scrolling and use only elements like <code>div</code> everything is just fine. I could throw away all the code for that after I realized that none of the common and modern browsers had any blocking issues. So I did. The only real latecomers were the web view components, no big deal for me here.</p><h3 id="before">Before</h3><h4 id="javascript">JavaScript</h4><pre><code><span>const </span><span>navbar </span><span>= </span><span>document</span><span>.querySelector(</span><span>'.navbar'</span><span>);

At the core of PWAs sit <a href="https://serviceworke.rs/">Service Workers (SW)</a>, though you can use SW also without building an app. And that's what I was aiming for, but in the end my home-grown dynamic cache solution was more annoying to me than helpful for anyone else.

I'm sure some people probably see visual inconsistencies due to a still running service worker in their browser.

This is pretty useful for slow internet connections; living here in Germany I know how difficult this situation can be. That thing called internet is still very Neuland to us. 🤦</p><p>Anyway, <code>SQIP</code> can be translated with »<code>SVG</code>-based <code>LQIP</code>.«</p><p><code>SVG</code> are Scalable Vector Graphics, an image format I really love a lot, my logo is done with it (<a href="https://markentier.tech/posts/2018/05/minimalism-focus-clean-redesign/">I wrote about it a while ago</a>).</p><p>LQIP finally stands for <em>»Low Quality Image Placeholders«</em> and is based on an algorithm to find primitive shapes to describe the source image. Basically try to find only a few triangles, rectangles, circles, ellipsis, and other low poly shapes. It is also an art form in its own, you can enjoy some <a href="https://github.com/fogleman/primitive#static-animation">nice examples there</a>. The advantage of SVG is that it is made to encode such figures in very few characters of human readable text, so a less complex image for a placeholder can be written in one kilobyte or less.</p><p>Compared to the original high resolution image which can easily weigh half a megabyte and more this is great. You can reserve the space in your page and very early in the loading process display some visual hint that there will be a proper picture soon. Especially for types which do not support progessive loading (as JPEG can) using SQIP/LQIP placeholders makes a lot of sense.</p><p>In this scenario at first it was not really about saving frontend <span>JS</span>, more about saving it on the backend site and replacing it with something else. Unfortunately in between some code creeped into the frontend anyway.</p><p>But what happened that this beautiful technique fell out of favor with me?</p><h3 id="picture"><code>&lt;picture&gt;</code></h3><p>Enter another interesting HTML tag combo: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture"><code>&lt;picture&gt;</code></a> with <code>&lt;source&gt;</code>.</p><p>So one reason to use small low quality placeholders is because before such tags became a thing we solely relied on a single <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> and some trickery with CSS (and sometimes aided by sprinkles of JavaScript). I tried to avoid <span>JS</span> completely, but of course I had to use some styling hacks eventually.</p><p>The essence of it was some style attached to the image in question:</p><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>img </span><span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"highres-and-heavy.png"
     </span><span>style</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>background-size</span><span>: </span><span>cover</span><span>;
            </span><span>background-image</span><span>: </span><span>url</span><span>(</span><span>'data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2…'</span><span>);</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>&lt;!-- Usually in some post processing all style attributes were collected
     into a &lt;style&gt; tag or CSS file. --&gt;
</span></code></pre><p>The JavaScript entered this scenery at one point: after I used images with transparency. Sadly with this background image workaround you would've seen the low quality placeholder through the transparent parts, and this was extremly ugly to be honest. I could not stand it and deployed some snippet to trigger a background removal once the actual image was loaded:</p><pre><code><span>// remove the background image styling, so transparent images won't have
// strange SQIP artefacts shining through
</span><span>document</span><span>.querySelectorAll(
  </span><span>"img[loading=lazy][class]:not(.thumbnail):not(.loaded)"
</span><span>).forEach((</span><span>img</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>{
  </span><span>img</span><span>.</span><span>onload </span><span>= </span><span>(</span><span>_event</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>img.className </span><span>= </span><span>"loaded"</span><span>;
});
</span><span>document</span><span>.querySelectorAll(
  </span><span>"img[loading=lazy].thumbnail:not(.loaded)"
</span><span>).forEach((</span><span>img</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>{
  </span><span>img</span><span>.</span><span>onload </span><span>= </span><span>(</span><span>_event</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>img.className </span><span>= </span><span>"thumbnail loaded"</span><span>;
});
</span></code></pre><p>Theoretically it would have been tolerable, but I noticed some strange behaviour once I started wrapping my images into <code>picture</code> tags.</p><p>Let's <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">shave the yak</a> a bit further to understand why.</p><h4 id="webp-and-avif">WEBP and AVIF</h4><p><em>Come on, more acronyms?</em> I'm sorry, the web is a place with a lot of them.</p><p>All you need to know for now is that both of them are pretty modern image formats with quite good (lossy) compression rates while keeping a respectable quality. <a href="https://caniuse.com/webp"><code>WEBP</code></a> has been around for some time and most of the browsers do support it. <a href="https://caniuse.com/avif"><code>AVIF</code></a> is extremly new and right now only Chrome since version 85 and Opera 71 can display them. Firefox has a configuration flag, maybe they will enable it by default pretty soon.</p><p>So the current situation is that I have my original image (PNG or JPEG in most cases), a WEBP version, an AVIF version, and the SQIP placeholder. How do I deal with it? Back to our <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> tag:</p><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>picture</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>source </span><span>srcset</span><span>=</span><span>"./cover.avif" </span><span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"image/avif"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>source </span><span>srcset</span><span>=</span><span>"./cover.webp" </span><span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"image/webp"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>img </span><span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"./cover.png"
       </span><span>style</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>/* SQIP data: see example above */</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>picture</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre><p>You can also use source sets for different view sizes based on media queries, but in my case I'm mainly concerned about supporting different image formats. My idea is to prioritize the formats with the smallest file size first, and given the compression ratios the order is usually: AVIF, WEBP, PNG/JPG. Not in every case will this be true; WEBP does not always have better savings then a decently compressed JPEG for example. AVIF has not disappointed so far, but sadly a part of my visitors will not see the effect yet.</p><p>What did not really happen anymore was a display of the placeholder before the final image was loaded. I experimented for quite some time until I realized that I do not want to spent more energy any further.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/sizes-png-webp-avif.w.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/sizes-png-webp-avif.w.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/sizes-png-webp-avif.w.png" alt="Size comparison of an example image; PNG original (22 KB), WEBP (14 KB, 37% saved), AVIF (7.3 KB, 67% saved)" width="1024" height="120" loading="lazy"></picture></p><p>I made a <em>risk-return tradeoff</em> compromise and got rid of SQIP altogether. For the growing number of AVIF support the images are sometimes significantly smaller which makes it acceptable to allow for some display delay anyway.</p><p>In the following screenshot the JPEG was the source photo. The PNG was created for some transparency stuff; of course, for photos this format does not really make a lot of sense in general. Sadly also WEBP fails to compete in this scenario. That's why I have to make this picture group generation a bit smarter soon to reorder based on the actual file …</p></div></div>

<p>Recently I’ve got into the idea of building a personal platform for myself. By that I mean a system which makes it easy to distribute new things I’m working on and a way to grow the group of people who could be interested in what I’m working on.</p>



<h2>How I’m going about building a platform</h2>



<ol><li>Leveraging what I already have<ol><li>I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjRhOxof_h24gemf8If3Klw?view_as=subscriber">YouTube channel</a> with a following</li><li>I have a network from my personal and professional life</li></ol></li><li>More content<ol><li>This blog</li><li>“Computer Security: Attacking and defending web apps” course on Udemy (because my most successful content on YouTube is about Cyber Security and I’ve had a lot of demand for making a video on how to write shell code)</li><li><a href="https://scenario95.com/">Scenario95</a></li></ol></li><li>Creating a pipeline which I use for all new content<ol><li>Send an email to followers of my platform</li><li>Sharing on several platforms including: Facebook, HackerNews, Reddit, Twitter, and LinkedIn</li></ol></li></ol>



<h2>Why I’m doing this?</h2>



<p>When coming up with new ideas I’ve noticed that I often base them around what I already have access to and natural advantages I’ve got. For example when on a course topic for Udemy, I referred to the YouTube video which I released 4 years ago… and I’ve realised that since finishing university I haven’t done a good job of continuing to create things like this.</p>







<p>This is something I’m new to and and still learning the ropes so if you’ve got any advice please leave it in the comments below. </p>



<p>If you want to follow my adventure then subscribe to my platform! </p>

                    <p>I had a problem. I wanted public documentation with open collaboration, but I couldn't afford most of the products out there. As a startup we need to keep lean, and adding a paid documentation/knowledge base service is an expense I don't want to have to try to recover.</p><p>So we're moving all of our product documentation into public Github repositories, as it's the cheapest option with it being free 😉</p><p>The first repository is here, for our Signata MFA product: <a href="https://github.com/cl-tim/signata-mfa-docs">https://github.com/cl-tim/signata-mfa-docs</a></p><h3 id="why-github">Why Github?</h3><p>As much as I find it frustrating to write documentation in markdown (writing is easy, dealing with screenshots is clunky), the benefits of having a publicly accessible repository for documentation far outweighs my frustration.</p><p>I want to make sure documentation isn't sitting behind paywalls or needing a sign up. In fact, forcing people to sign up to read it has created a ton of accounts in our system that don't actually get used, which is an inconvenience for both parties.</p><p>The best part of putting it into Github is now there's the ability to collaborate - if you find a problem, or ambiguous statement, or you want something added, you can now directly interact with the content to submit pull requests or open issues.</p><p>We've also put a link to the documentation onto the Signata MFA website in a few places, which you'll also notice has undergone some rebranding:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.congruentlabs.co/content/images/2020/11/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.congruentlabs.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image.png 600w, https://blog.congruentlabs.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image.png 1000w, https://blog.congruentlabs.co/content/images/2020/11/image.png 1458w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>It's actually quite expensive to run an online knowledgebase in most instances. <a href="https://readthedocs.org/">Read the Docs</a> would've been the ideal choice, but it's only free for open source projects, and at this stage we don't yet have plans to open source our products. I could've spun up a self-hosted service like Dokuwiki, but that would be an additional $10/month of operating costs, as well as the administrative overhead for keeping it up to date.</p><p>An alternative we thought about was to use publicly accessible Google Docs, but they lose the ability to be indexed by search engines for people to actually find these guides. There's not much use to public documentation if it's not actually discoverable by the public.</p><h3 id="signata-mfa-presentation">Signata MFA Presentation</h3><p>I've also thrown a presentation that we put together about Signata MFA into the repository as well. <a href="https://github.com/cl-tim/signata-mfa-docs/blob/main/signata-mfa-overview-presentation.pdf">You can find it here</a> - it'll give you a quick overview of the product, it's capabilities, it's pricing, and how to get in contact with us.</p><p>Have you looked at Signata MFA? <a href="https://mfa.signata.net/">You can check it out by clicking here</a>. You can try it for free for a month, no credit card required.</p>

<p>In 1790, the gap between the smallest and largest states was about 10x. Today, the most populous state, California, is about 70x more populous than the least populous state, Wyoming. A resident of California, New York, Florida, or Texas has no effective impact on the Senate impact, and a resident of a smaller state Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska, the Dakotas, Delaware, Rhode Island, or Maine has a disproportionate impact on the Senate.</p>
<p>While the Electoral College favors smaller states as well, it is still mostly driven by membership in the House of Representatives, which is proportionate to population. That’s unfair—the popular vote loser became president in 2000 and 2016— but it’s far less unfair than the even-more-undemocratic Senate.</p>
<p><strong>The Senate has become the defining slow-motion crisis of American democracy.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The US Senate could be the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/08/senate-washington-dc-puerto-rico-statehood-filibuster-obama-biden-racist.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">most structurally racist institution</a>.</strong> In the 1960s, Black people from the South <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3162/036298006X201869" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">migrated to populous Northern states</a>, eroding their political representation in the Senate. Similarly, recent decades have seen <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3162/036298006X201869" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">growing Latinx populations in urban areas</a>, primarily located in populous states. As a result, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/14/opinion/dc-puerto-rico-statehood-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">David Leonhardt found</a> that whites have 0.35 Senators per million people, Blacks have 0.26, Asian-Americans 0.25, and Latinos just 0.19.</li>
<li><strong>Partisanship and rule changes have caused the problem to boil over.</strong> According to <a href="https://govtrackinsider.com/the-senate-has-never-been-as-un-democratic-as-it-was-in-2017-2018-and-minority-rule-could-801e1046af28" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a 2018 analysis</a>, the Senate has never been as undemocratic as it was in 2017-2018. According to this analysis, “in 2017, for the first time, the Senate’s decisions were often made by a coalition of states representing less than half of the country’s population. The median share of senators supporting passed bills, confirmed judges and agency leaders, and other matters dropped to 58% (the lowest since 1930), with those senators representing just 49.5% of the U.S. population (the lowest ever)!”</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s time for us to revisit the Connecticut Compromise, the Devil’s Bargain that allowed for the adoption of the Constitution at the expense of a democratic Senate.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-role-of-the-senate"><a href="#whats-the-role-of-the-senate" aria-label="whats the role of the senate permalink"></a>What’s the Role of the Senate?</h2>
<p>The Senate is a smaller, more deliberative body than the House of Representatives. You have to be 30 years old to run for the Senate, and in 1790, you would have had an average life expectancy of about <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2885717/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">45 years</a>. Indeed, “Senator” comes from the Latin word “senex,” which means “senior” or “old man.”</p>
<p>Senators run on staggered 6-year terms, not the 2-year term of the House. That means that their terms exceed presidential terms and—unlike representatives—they don’t have to run in every election. While there are 435 representatives in the House, there are only 100 senators. Unlike members of the House, Senate representatives were meant to be appointed by the state legislatures, a process that changed after the 17th amendment in 1913. This meant that the Senate was meant to be a kind of U.N.-but-with-teeth for 13 (and now 50) coequal sovereigns.</p>
<p>These features—insulation from short-term political pressure and a more selective and deliberative group of representatives—are unrelated to the two-per-state design of the US Senate, and don’t benefit from it.</p>

<p>Some people defend the Connecticut Compromise as an enduring legacy of founder wisdom. But the Connecticut Compromise wasn’t meant to be wise, it was meant to be pragmatic. </p>
<p>Seven weeks into the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the founders were at an impasse.</p>
<p>Many large states felt that representation should be proportional to population in Congress. As larger states would be contributing more to the treasury and defense, they felt that should have more say.</p>
<p>Smaller states like Delaware and Rhode Island—and representatives from certain larger but slower-growing states like New York (except for Alexander Hamilton, of course)—weren’t having it, and had leverage. These states enjoyed authority and autonomy under the Articles of Confederation. Proportionate representation—plus anticipation of a rapidly growing South and West—would erode their political power.</p>
<p>Connecticut delegates Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth, with the support of Benjamin Franklin, struck a compromise: a bicameral (two-chambered) legislature, with one chamber, the House of Representatives, allocating seats in proportion to population, and the other chamber, the Senate, allocated evenly by state. Benjamin Franklin proposed that the House originate all revenue matters.</p>
<p>Alexander Hamilton hated it. Writing in Federalist 22:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Its operation contradicts the fundamental maxim of republican government, which requires that the sense of the majority should prevail. Sophistry may reply, that sovereigns are equal, and that a majority of the votes of the States will be a majority of confederated America. But this kind of logical legerdemain will never counteract the plain suggestions of justice and common-sense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Madison, in Federalist 62, didn’t want to defend it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The equality of representation in the Senate is another point, which, being evidently the result of compromise between the opposite pretensions of the large and the small States, does not call for much discussion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The decision to allocate Senate seats was a compromise needed to ratify the Constitution and satisfice an existing power structure—nothing more.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-the-hardest-thing-to-change-about-the-constitution"><a href="#this-is-the-hardest-thing-to-change-about-the-constitution" aria-label="this is the hardest thing to change about the constitution permalink"></a>This is the Hardest Thing to Change about the Constitution</h2>
<p>One possible mechanism of reform is amending the Constitution. Suppose you wanted to change the Senate to allocate seats in proportion to population. Not so fast—Article V of the Constitution writes that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution,</strong> or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; <strong>and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Article V articulates a state right—equal suffrage in the Senate—that cannot be deprived through the Constitutional change process. Put differently: you can change anything in the Constitution (after 1808) through amendments or a convention, but you cannot change this aspect of the Connecticut Compromise.</p>
<p>In practice, even Justice Scalia <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/the-weirdest-sentence-in-the-u-s-constitution" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">once remarked</a> that he didn’t see how the Supreme Court could declare a properly proposed and ratified Constitutional amendment unconstitutional. It is unclear how a future Supreme Court might view a dispute around this kind of Constitutional amendment, although any well-written amendment would begin by changing Article V.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this speed bump, passing constitutional amendments requires the consent of 3/4 of the states, meaning that the 12 least populous states could block any Senate reform amendment.</p>

<p>An improvement to the representation problem has the following qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is legal. In this sense, legal means that it would survive a challenge in the Supreme Court in which the justices were approved by a partisan Senate.</li>
<li>It preserves the “deliberative” aspects of the Senate.</li>
<li>It reduces population inequality in the Senate.</li>
<li>It is politically tractable.</li>
</ul>
<p>A better solution to this problem has these additional properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>New statehood, or reorganized statehood, is incentive-compatible. That means that citizens of prospective new states (Puerto Rico, for instance) should have the opportunity to form a state and be admitted to the Senate without disproportionately diluting power.</li>
<li>Senate proportionality is robust to population shifts. If Wyoming became a booming population center, then Wyoming should have more Senate representation.</li>
<li>It decreases wasted votes and reduces the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/How_the_Efficiency_Gap_Standard_Works.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">efficiency gap</a>.

        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Especially after COVID-19 began plaguing the planet, QR codes have been a big part of our daily lives. In this day and age, it’s quite impossible for one to have never seen a QR code, or used one. Even before the pandemic, QR codes had been around us for a while, but many of us — having grown up in the Digital Age — simply accept new technology into our lives without wondering too much about how they work. For most of us, QR codes just look like... square pixelated versions of the alien heptapod symbols in Arrival (2016), that somehow, magically (and really quickly) bring us to a different screen when we scan them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So what are these cryptic codes? Are they magic? Clearly they’re not, but how do they work? Before we take you in for the ride, let’s get the basics down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>QR stands for <em>Quick Response</em>, and a QR code is pretty much a barcode (which has been around since the 1950s) except two-dimensional. Because it’s 2D, it can contain more data than a barcode. It can encode over 7000 characters, which is a vast improvement from the standard barcode with a limited capacity of about 20 alphanumeric characters.</p>
<h2>How did they come about?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>In Japan circa 1990s, Denso Wave Incorporated was contacted by manufacturing sites and asked if it was possible to come up with a faster barcode scanning system. This presented a problem as barcodes had a limited capacity, which made the scanning process time consuming for workers no matter how efficient the scanner was. To tackle this, Denso Wave began developing a compact code that can contain more data, including Kanji and Kana characters. The launch of the QR code was later announced in 1994.</p>
<h2>What are they used for?</h2>
<p>The QR code was first used by the auto industry to track parts and products shipped around the globe. Then, gradually, other industries all over the world began joining in. Today, QR codes are used by nearly every physical and digital establishment for quick check-ins, displaying geolocation or contact info, redirecting customers to their websites, etc.</p>
<h2>How do they work?</h2>
<p>Grasping how a QR code works would require understanding the functions of its different parts. With the help of the labelled diagram, we hope to make this palatable for the layman. Let’s break it down.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=715&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png" alt="QR Structure, modules, separators, alignment, timing, format info, version, labels, black and white" width="715" srcset="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=358&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 358w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=715&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 715w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=1073&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 1073w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=1430&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 1430w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=1788&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 1788w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=2145&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 2145w" sizes="(max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px"></p>

<p>The tiny squares in a QR code are called <em><strong>modules</strong></em> - black squares would be considered foreground modules, and white ones would be background modules. They don’t always have to be black and white, though, they could be in color too. Most QR codes are in black and white only so decoder softwares easily distinguish the contrast between the background and foreground. If you want your QR code to be colorful, you just have to make sure that the contrast is retained when it is in grayscale / black and white.</p>
<p>The bigger the code, the more rows and columns of modules it will contain. Yup, just like humankind, QR codes come in different shapes, sizes and colors (although there are standards to follow).</p>
<p>There are 40 preset sizes (or, <em><strong>versions</strong></em>) to choose from. Version 1 being the smallest type with 21 rows and 21 columns, and Version 40 being the largest with 177 rows and 177 columns. When a generator produces a code for you, it will determine the suitable QR code version number for you depending on the amount of data you are encoding.</p>
<p>The 3 big squares on 3 corners of the QR code are <em><strong>finder patterns</strong></em>, which help your device camera determine the boundaries of the code and its correct orientation. This is so if the code is rotated, or upside-down, decoders would still be able to read it. These finder patterns are surrounded by a single-module spacing called <em><strong>separators</strong></em> which help decoders separate the finder patterns from the code data.</p>
<p>Connecting each finder pattern are <em><strong>timing patterns</strong></em> that alternate between black and white. These lines tell your decoder software how big the data cells are within the code.</p>
<p>The smaller square (that is distinctively not a finder pattern) on the fourth corner is an <em><strong>alignment pattern</strong></em> that helps the decoder prevent image distortions. Level 1 QR codes (the smallest size of QR codes) do not contain alignment patterns. The bigger the code, however, the more alignment patterns are added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 15 bits beside the separators are <em><strong>format and version strings</strong></em> which contain information on the code’s error correction level and the chosen mask pattern for the particular code. Hold on… information on the what and what?</p>
<p><em><strong>Error correction</strong></em> code makes sure that the code is still readable if up to 30% of the code is corrupt. Designers or generators of a code can decide how many levels of error correction they want to include in the code. The higher the level of error correction, the higher percentage of corruption a decoder can read past. However, the higher the level of error correction, the more space it takes up on the QR code, leaving less space for data. In other words, the more space the error correction code takes up, the lower the max numerical characters a QR code can fit. How much error correction a QR code needs probably will depend on where it will be displayed. E.g. A QR code on a paper flyer would need higher error correction than one on a laminated poster placed indoors, and a digital QR code could do with none because it is unlikely to be damaged.</p>
<p>The code is also overlaid by a <em><strong>mask pattern</strong></em>, inverting and retaining certain data areas to “mix it up” / conceal it. Decoder softwares detect the mask type from the format information and demask the QR code before reading the rest of the data. Of course this happens in a matter of milliseconds.</p>
<p><em><strong>Encoded characters </strong></em>- The black and white modules read in a fixed zigzaggy direction (as shown in the image), starting from the bottom right corner, gives the decoder a sequence of data bits that goes something like 001010111…&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Different binary sequences represent different codewords, which include symbols, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, etc. For example, the binary sequence 01110111 represents the letter ‘w’, 00100001 represents the exclamation point ‘!’, and 00100000 represents a space.</p>
<h2><strong>How can you make a QR code?</strong></h2>
<p><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Mi8ate-UiC0ZpKEoRFn8EUpe5bZDS5O6ggTSK96wPR1OTHx_zoKu_dbS5NvJDpPRsDAt9qdHXkQdfo1sm8Jun4Id0dpS3JjSnmOO51mXv6NT1ql7rb5P0DJc01k-kuw9RYw5vMF2" alt="QR code, generated QR code, snappymob website" width="297"></span></p>
<p>Here’s a QR code generated with <a href="http://www.qr-code-generator.com/"><span>www.qr-code-generator.com</span></a>. Do the patterns make a lot more sense to you now? If you can’t answer in confidence, that’s okay. You’re not going to have to make one by hand, ever. (Unless you want to.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are plenty of offline and online QR code generators free for use. All you have to do is key in what you want to encode in the QR code, be it a link to a coupon redemption page, a YouTube video, your social media sites, your contact details, or simply a website homepage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most free QR code generators, though, require you to sign up or subscribe to a plan to gain access to more design options and features, such as error correction levels and insights tracking.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>How can QR codes help you?</strong></h2>
<p>Whether you own a business or simply have a web page to share, a QR code could help people reach you easily and quickly. In case you were looking for ideas, here are some of the ways in which using a QR code could greatly benefit you:</p>
<h4><strong>Webpages and Location</strong></h4>
<p>Your customers can get to your website, social media platforms, or map location in a matter of seconds. They don’t have to manually type your website URL, usernames, or addresses into their browsers or maps. They simply need to whip out their phones and scan the QR code to be redirected to you.</p>
<h4><strong>Payment</strong></h4>
<p>Payment is also made easy with QR codes. Most stores enable QR codes for quick payment via e-wallets so customers don’t have to fumble through their wallets for cash and keep others waiting. Some good examples would be GrabPay or ShopeePay, which are enabled at many on and offline merchants in Malaysia.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=648&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg" alt="grabpay, shopeepay, qr code, merchant, scan to pay, app" width="648" srcset="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=324&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 324w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=648&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 648w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=972&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 972w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=1296&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 1296w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=1620&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 1620w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=1944&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 1944w" sizes="(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px"><br>(Image Source: help.shopee.com.my, grab.com)</p>
<h4><strong>Email and Direct Messaging</strong></h4>
<p>You can embed URL links that lead straight to a ‘compose email’ or ‘compose direct message’ page (for instance, <a href="mailto:hello@snappymob.com">mailto:hello@snappymob.com</a>) into your QR code. For email, this saves your customers up to 10 seconds because it helps them skip the process of opening their email app, tapping on compose email, and typing your email address manually into the recipient bar. For social media, this saves them the effort of opening the app, typing your username into the search bar, and tapping on the message button. This might literally be “a matter of seconds” which seems small, but it keeps people who are interested in your services or products, well, interested. Making things quicker and easier for your patrons is always a good move.</p></span></p><p><label>app insights</label></p>

<p>Often times, when you want to compare two videos side-by-side or you want to create an effect during post-processing, you might want to stack videos together. It can get expensive if you end up buying a tool to do this, but, guess what? </p>



<p><strong>FFmpeg offers a variety of tools to help stack videos together – horizontally, vertically, or in a grid fashion. In this tutorial, let’s learn about FFmpeg’s <code>hstack</code> and <code>vstack</code> filters for stacking videos. </strong></p>



<hr>




<h2><span id="How_to_Stack_Videos_Horizontally_using_FFmpeg"></span><strong>How to Stack Videos Horizontally using FFmpeg?</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>“Horizontally stacking videos” refers to placing videos side-by-side (one on the left and the other on the right). </p>



<p>Before you do this, there are a couple of points that you need to consider. </p>



<ol><li>The videos that you want to stack need to have the same height. </li><li> The videos need to have the same pixel format. </li></ol>



<p>The command line is shown below where we try and stack two <code>mp4</code> videos. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4&nbsp;-filter_complex hstack=inputs=2 horizontal-stacked-output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>The <code>hstack</code> filter has a simple format. You need to specify the number of inputs and it parses that from the beginning portion of the commandline. The order of stacking follows the order of inputs. </p>



<p>Here is a screenshot of what it looks like. </p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4FwbqByqDpDpOGTNvpSWSOh6RVE9yzesrQyAyGvaOF1ZjVsycKOlQUjrTmdJRFJWblHjC9gF6zMds0s5w2Yy2w6CVXXme-H-zF8nYoJ496khN0aHXHaWbnwEe41BYmu6c2mdoQb8" alt="stack videos using ffmpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>And, here is a video! </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475731721" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>







<p>Here is another use case. Companies or teams working on video compression often like to compare videos side-by-side in the lab or showcase their work in conferences. FFmpeg’s horizontal stacking is an easy way to do this and achieve a very good result. </p>



<p>Below are two videos encoded at different video quality settings and stacked horizontally. Comparison made simple, right? <em>(note: Vimeo’s choise of bitrate might mess with the comparison, but, when done offline (downloaded), the <code>hstack</code> filter makes comparisons easy!)</em></p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/476095363" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>

<h2><span id="Stacking_Videos_Vertically_using_FFmpeg"></span><strong>Stacking Videos Vertically using FFmpeg</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>“Vertically stacked videos” results in placing videos one below the other. Unlike in horizontal stacking, inputs need to be having the same width. The command is as shown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For vertical stacking, we need to use the <code>vstack</code> filter whose syntax is similar to the <code>hstack</code> filter we used in the previous horizontal stacking example.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4&nbsp;-filter_complex vstack=inputs=2 vertical-stack-output.mp4</code></pre>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qtyxioWFR54pqwZhX7jgX6HkSG7gCw840GdK78HGHHP7X3sv3fr3Pou9hOMFu2O-e6O7nmCith3U6CM1SpDanhwmIFIBzZUQyaG4T0BJaF9QCdMIPrmMmH0qc9WTK5f-5Nf4-92y" alt="stack videos using ffmpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>Both functions pretty much use the same commands with a simple distinction, the <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#hstack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>hstack</code></a> and the <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#vstack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>vstack</code></a> under the <code>-filter_complex</code> argument.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a video of stacking two videos vertically using FFmpeg. </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475731607" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>

<h2><span id="Stacking_Videos_of_Different_Lengths"></span><strong>Stacking Videos of Different Lengths</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>Well, there’s a really nifty ability for both of these to prioritize the length of the shortest video. And as luck would have it the parameter is named <code>shortest</code>, and it’s applicable to both the horizontal and vertical stacking filters. Using <code>shortest=1</code> ensures the shortest length is used. </p>



<p>For example – </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4 -filter_complex hstack=inputs=2:shortest=1 shortest-output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>As a <b>side note</b>, if you run into an error that claims frames are being duplicated, the easiest workaround is to slip the <code>vsync 2</code> parameter into your command, and it worked like a charm.</p>



<h3><span id="Stacking_Videos_of_Different_Lengths_Without_the_shortest_parameter"></span>Stacking Videos of Different Lengths Without the <code>shortest</code> parameter<span></span></h3>



<p>To test what happens in this situation, let’s stack two videos vertically – a 10 second clip and an 18 second clip. You’ll see that the shorter clip just stops after it completes, but the output video continues till the longest of the input clips complete.  </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475731684" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>











<p>If you want to truncate the clips to the length of the shortest clip, then you need to use the <code>shortest=1</code> parameter. Let’s look at that in the next section.</p>



<h3><span id="Stacking_Videos_of_Different_Lengths_With_the_shortest=1_parameter"></span>Stacking Videos of Different Lengths With the <code>shortest=1</code> parameter<span></span></h3>



<p>In this example, we use the <code>shortest=1</code> command-line parameter and as you can see, the length of the final video is truncated to the length of the shortest of the inputs. </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475731643" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="2%C3%972_Grid_of_Videos_using_FFmpeg"></span><strong><strong>2×2 Grid of Videos using FFmpeg</strong></strong><span></span></h2>



<p>We can achieve a 2×2 grid of videos using a combination of the <code>hstack</code> and <code>vstack</code> filters. Let’s start by looking at the command-line and then break it down. It’s actually pretty simple! </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg \
-i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4 -i input2.mp4 -i input3.mp4 \
-filter_complex \
"[0:v][1:v]hstack=inputs=2[top]; \
[2:v][3:v]hstack=inputs=2[bottom]; \
[top][bottom]vstack=inputs=2[v]" \
-map "[v]" \
finalOutput.mp4</code></pre>



<p>What’s happening here?</p>



<ul><li>firstly, you need to provide 4 input videos with the same height and width</li><li>next, you stack the first two videos horizontally and call it “top” i.e. <code>[0:v][1:v]hstack=inputs=2[top]</code></li><li>then, you you stack the next two videos horizontally and call it “bottom” i.e. <code>[2:v][3:v]hstack=inputs=2[bottom]</code></li><li>then, you stack <code>top</code> and <code>bottom</code> vertically to create a 2×2 grid. — <code>[top][bottom]vstack=inputs=2[v]</code></li><li>then using the <code>map</code> command, we can extract and push the video track to the output container. </li></ul>



<p>Here is what the video looks like. </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475771172" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="3%C3%972_Grid_of_Videos_using_FFmpeg"></span><strong>3×2 Grid of Videos using FFmpeg</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>Along the same lines, here is a 3×2 grid of videos using <code>hstack</code> and <code>vstack</code> filters. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg \
-i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4 \
-i input2.mp4 -i input3.mp4 \
-i input4.mp4 -i input5.mp4 \
-filter_complex \
"[0:v][1:v][2:v]hstack=inputs=3[top];\
[3:v][4:v][5:v]hstack=inputs=3[bottom];\
[top][bottom]vstack=inputs=2[v]" \
-map "[v]" \
finalOutput.mp4</code></pre>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475780643" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The debate on the impact telework has on employee productivity &amp; morale is one that has slowly aged with the improvement of technology, but never so important to discuss than in the current global pandemic state the world is faced with.</p><p>For decades the working class has enjoyed, and even thrived in the conventional 9-to-5 office workday with very little contention. In fact, most of the well-known productivity techniques are centered around the premise that employees can only maximize team cohesion &amp; communication when working in a controlled work environment like the office.</p><p>But with the rise of the digital age and need to travel, the world has started to realize the value and need for remote work and set in place internal measures to promote alternative work methods that benefit the workforce.<br>
&nbsp;</p><h2>Reimagining the 9-to-5 workday could improve productivity</h2><p>The contemporary 9-to-5, eight-hour workday was imagined by American labor unions in the 1800s and normalized by Henry Ford in the 1920s. Most employees today simply accept this narrative because it’s what they have gotten so acquainted with. But despite the growing popularity in the demand for remote and flexible work, the need for a change in work culture has been met with much skepticism from managers. A recent study conducted by Remote Workplace Study explores the prime obstacles to implementing a flexible workplace policy:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Company’s long-standing resistance to change &nbsp;</li><li>Privacy</li><li>Lack of understanding about the benefits of remote work</li><li>Fear of how it will impact the overall company culture</li><li>Technology requirements</li><li>Data security</li></ul><p>Understandably, managers have reservations about changing traditional work culture. Most concerns center around losing control of assessing team cohesiveness and potential reduction in employee productivity &amp; focus. But despite this, change is inevitable. In fact, most studies confirm an increase in productivity, working “smarter” and willingness to work over-time when employees are given the flexibility to choose when and how to work.&nbsp;</p><h2>Millennials are driving the demand for flexible and remote work&nbsp;</h2><p>As of today, millennials (those born between 1981 and 1996) account for almost 50% of the global workforce and are expected to grow to 75% by 2025. This means that the need for companies to adopt flexible and remote work policies is more compelling today than ever before in order to attract and retain a younger, skilled workforce.&nbsp;</p><h2>There are equal benefits to jumping on the remote-work bandwagon for both companies and employees:</h2><p>There are equal benefits to jumping on the remote-work bandwagon for both companies and employees:</p><h3>For Companies</h3><ul><li>Cost savings (office &amp; overhead costs)</li><li>Increase in productivity</li><li>Employee retention &amp; reduced turnover</li><li>Profitability (companies save avg. $11, 000 &nbsp;per part-time telecommuter)</li><li>Environmental benefits (less commuting to work reduces carbon footprint)</li><li>Improved inclusivity and diversity (easier reach and accessibility to skilled talent from different demographics, races, and people with disabilities from all over the world)</li></ul><h3>For Employees</h3><ul><li>Improved work-life balance</li><li>Flexible schedule</li><li>No commute (time and cost savings)</li><li>Location independence (work from home/travel while working)</li><li>More time to spend with family</li><li>Expense savings (transportation, gas, &amp; freedom &nbsp;to live in low-cost cities) &nbsp;</li></ul><h2>The world’s largest firms have endorsed remote working policies in the wake of Covid19</h2><p>It’s no secret that the novel Coronavirus pandemic has played an integral role in the sudden surge of remote work policies implemented across companies worldwide. Big corporations such as Twitter, Facebook, Google, Amazon, &amp; Microsoft have adopted such changes with Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey announcing that his employees can work remotely indefinitely.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“... the work-from-home revolution is shaping the future of the workplace.”</p></blockquote><p>Improved inclusivity and diversity (easier reach and accessibility to skilled talent from different demographics, races, and people with disabilities from all over the world)</p><p>In closing, albeit reservations from conservative and outdated work practices, the future of the work environment is remote and flexible work. In the age of the internet, connecting with skilled professionals has become easier and accessible. Thanks to online professional platforms like remoteworkers.net, companies have access to a wider pool of highly experienced talent and job-seekers can find their ideal remote jobs. Companies would be wise to evolve with the growth in remote work trends in order to become more competitive &amp; improve productivity.</p><h2>Looking for a remote job?</h2><p>Thanks to the internet, connecting skilled professionals with remote-friendly companies has never been easier.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>In the last blog post, we proved that <a href="https://www.ezzeddinabdullah.com/posts/how-to-clean-csv-data-at-the-command-line">xsv is ~1882x faster than csvkit</a> when joining two CSVs and saw how performant xsv is and when we can use <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv" target="_blank">xsv</a> or <a href="https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">csvkit</a> when we are at the terminal.</p><p>Today, we're talking about part 2 of cleaning CSV data at the command line investigating a large CSV&nbsp;file (from&nbsp;Kaggle)&nbsp;that contains <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/colinmorris/reddit-usernames">~26 million users and their number of comments</a> posted from 2005 to 2017. We also talked about <a href="https://www.ezzeddinabdullah.com/posts/how-to-clean-text-data-at-the-command-line">cleaning text files in general using the command line</a> if you want to check out.</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>You just need to install <strong>csvkit </strong>and <strong>xsv </strong>with the following commands:</p><h3>install csvkit</h3><p>Just need pip to be able to install csvkit:</p><h3>install xsv</h3><p>Binaries for Windows, Linux and macOS are available <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv/releases/latest">from Github</a>.</p><p>Or if you're using macOS&nbsp;Homebrew, install it just like this:</p><p>Compiling from its repository also works similarly:<br></p><div><pre>$ git clone git://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv
$ cd xsv
$ cargo build --release
</pre></div><p>but you need to have <a href="https://crates.io/install">Cargo installed </a>which is Rust's package manager since xsv is written in Rust</p><h2>Concatenating: xsv cat vs csvstack</h2><p>Let's first create a CSV file to play with instead of the large&nbsp;file. Create it with your favorite text editor or just at the command line:</p><div><pre>$ cat &gt;&gt; fake_users.csv
author,n
x,5
z,7
y,6

</pre></div><p>Here, we’d like to concatenate this <strong>fake_users.csv </strong>file with the large <strong>users.csv </strong>file.</p><p>To see the effect of the performance here, we will stack the large file first because that will be more accurate when using <strong>tail</strong> to validate that the second file is already read into memory and concatenated.</p><p><strong>xsv </strong>has a tool for that which is <strong>cat</strong>, let's use it:</p><div><pre>$ time xsv cat rows users.csv fake_users.csv | tail

</pre></div><ul role="list"><li><strong>rows </strong>here is used to indicate that we will concatenate the rows so the rows of the second file will be appended to the rows of the first file</li></ul><p>Time here taken by <strong>xsv cat </strong>is ~15s</p><p><strong>csvkit </strong>also has a <strong>csvstack </strong>tool, let’s see it:</p><div><pre>$ time csvstack users.csv fake_users.csv | tail

real	1m7.213s
user	1m21.464s
sys	0m1.026s
</pre></div><p>Time here taken by <strong>csvstack </strong>is ~1.7mins </p><p>So approximately, <strong>xsv </strong>is ~7x faster here than <strong>csvkit</strong></p><h2>Sorting: pandas.sort_values() vs xsv sort vs GNU&nbsp;sort vs csvsort</h2><p>Let’s first see how <strong>csvsort </strong>and <strong>xsv sort </strong>work by sorting <em>fake_users.csv </em>by the number of comments <em>n</em>:</p><div><pre>$ csvsort -c n fake_users.csv
author,n
x,5
y,6
z,7
</pre></div><p>We can also sort in reverse order by setting the option <strong>-r:</strong></p><div><pre>$ csvsort -rc n fake_users.csv
author,n
z,7
y,6
x,5
</pre></div><p>The equivalent <strong>xsv</strong> command is:</p><div><pre>$ xsv sort -RNs n fake_users.csv 
</pre></div><p><strong>-RNs </strong>is a combination of: </p><ul role="list"><li><strong>-R </strong>for reverse order</li><li><strong>-N&nbsp;</strong>for numeric sorting</li><li><strong>-s </strong>for selecting the column that you sort by</li></ul><p>After downloading <strong>users.csv</strong>,<strong> </strong>the ~359MB CSV file, let's sort it with <strong>xsv </strong>first. This is a +25 million records so expect a latency here!</p><div><pre>$ time xsv sort -RNs n users.csv &gt; /dev/null

real	1m48.611s
user	1m27.743s
sys	0m16.621s
</pre></div><p>So <strong>xsv sort </strong>took here ~1.4 mins for this much data.</p><p>Let's try the <strong>sort </strong>command coming with the UNIX system:</p><div><pre>$ time sort -t, -rnk2 users.csv &gt; /dev/null

real	6m29.940s
user	5m49.416s
sys	0m32.340s
</pre></div><ul role="list"><li><strong>-t, </strong>to determine the field separator which is comma here as the file is a CSV file</li><li><strong>-r</strong> for reverse order<strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>-n </strong>for numeric sorting </li><li><strong>-k2 </strong>for setting the key field (the column that you sort by which is the second column here)</li></ul><p>Here <strong>BSD&nbsp;sort </strong>took ~6.3min which is ~5x slower than <strong>xsv</strong></p><p>What about <strong>csvsort</strong>? </p><div><pre>$ time csvsort -rc n users.csv &gt; /dev/null
</pre></div><p>Do you know that I have terminated my terminal after <strong>more than an hour</strong> of waiting for this command to complete execution and it's not completed yet!</p><p>Knowing that <strong>csvkit </strong>is written in pure python can somehow proves that it's not advisable to write a very performant tool with such technology alone unless you use C or Cython with Python as <strong>Pandas</strong> did:</p><div><pre>$ python sort_with_pandas.py
Time: 77.732413994
</pre></div><p><strong>Pandas</strong> here beats ALL, <strong>csvkit</strong>, <strong>BSD&nbsp;sort</strong>, and even <strong>xsv </strong>with execution time of ~78 seconds which means it's very close to <strong>xsv </strong>result (1.4min = 84s) so just 6 seconds difference and with each run, the time varies so it's acceptable for <strong>xsv </strong>to be competing with <strong>pandas </strong>for performance.</p><h2>Final thoughts</h2><p>From our investigation of the 26 million records data of the Reddit username data, it seems that <strong>xsv</strong> is the fastest command line I ever used and I think ever existed at the terminal.

    		<p><a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> and <a href="http://chapel.cray.com/">Chapel</a>
are both newish languages aimed at productitive scientific computing,
with parallel computing capabilities baked in from the start.
There’s lots of information about both online, but not much comparing
the two.  If you are starting a new scientific computing project
and are willing to try something new, which should you choose?  What
are their strengths and weaknesses, and how do they compare?</p>

<p>Here we walk through a comparison, focusing on distributed-memory
parallelism of the sort one would want for HPC-style simulation.
Both have strengths in largely disjoint areas.  If you want matlib-like
interactivity and plotting, and need only coodinator-worker parallelism,
Julia is the clear winner; if you want MPI+OpenMPI type scability
on rectangular distributed arrays (dense or sparse), Chapel wins
handily.  Both languages and environments have clear untapped
potential and room to grow; we’ll talk about future prospects of
the two languages at the end.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I’ve updated the timings - I hadn’t been using <code>@inbounds</code>
in the Julia code, and I had misconfigured my Chapel install so
that the compiles weren’t optimized; this makes a huge difference on
the 2d advection problem.  All timings now are on an AWS c4.8x instance.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-overview-of-the-two-languages">A quick overview of the two languages</h2>

<h3 id="julia">Julia</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia project</a> describes Julia as “a
high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for
numerical computing.”  It exploits type inference of rich types,
just-in-time compilation, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch">multiple
dispatch</a> (think
of R, with say <code>print()</code> defined to operate differently on scalars,
data&nbsp;frames, or linear regression fits) to provide a dynamic,
interactive, “scripting language”-type high level numerical programming
language that gives performance less than but competitive with
C or Fortran.</p>

<p>The project sees the language as more or less a matlab-killer, and
so focusses on that sort of interface; interactive, through a REPL
or Jupyter notebook (both available to try <a href="https://juliabox.com/">online</a>),
with integrated plotting; also, indexing begins at one, as God
intended.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Julia blurs the distinction between scientific users of Julia and
developers in two quite powerful ways.  The first is lisp-like
<a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/metaprogramming/">metaprogramming</a>,
where julia code can be generated or modified from within Julia,
making it possible to build domain-specific langauges (DSLs) inside Julia
for problems; this allows simple APIs for broad problem sets which
nonetheless take full advantage of the structure of the particular
problems being solved; <a href="https://github.com/JuliaStats">JuliaStats</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl">DifferentialEquations.jl</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/JuliaFEM/JuliaFEM.jl">JuliaFEM</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl">JuMP</a> offer hints of what
that could look like.  Another sort of functionality this enables
is <a href="https://julialang.org/blog/2016/03/parallelaccelerator">Parallel Accellerator</a>, an
intel package that can rewrite some regular array operations into
fast, vectorized native code.  This code-is-data aspect of Julia,
combined with the fact that much of Julia itself is written in Julia,
puts user-written code on an equal footing with much “official”
julia code.</p>

<p>The second way Julia blurs the line between user and developer is
the <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/packages/">package system</a>
which uses git and GitHub; this means that once you’ve installed
someone’s package, you’re very close to being able to file a pull
request if you find a bug, or to fork the package to specialize
it to your own needs; and it’s similarly very easy to
contribute a package if you’re already using GitHub to develop the
package.</p>

<p>Julia has support for remote function execution (“out of the box”
using SSH + TCP/IP, but other transports are available through
packages), and distributed rectangular arrays; thread support
is still experimental, as is shared-memory on-node arrays.</p>

<h3 id="chapel">Chapel</h3>

<p>While Julia is a scientific programming language with parallel
computing support, Chapel is a programming language for parallel
scientific computing. It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitioned_global_address_space">PGAS</a>
language, with partitioned but globally-accessible variables, using
<a href="https://gasnet.lbl.gov/">GASNet</a> for communications.  It takes PGAS
two steps further however than languages like <a href="https://www.dursi.ca/post/coarray-fortran-goes-mainstream-gcc-5-1.html">Coarray
Fortran</a>,
<a href="http://upc.lbl.gov/">UPC</a>, or <a href="http://x10-lang.org/">X10</a>.</p>

<p>The first extension is to define all large data structures (arrays,
associative arrays, graphs) as being defined over <em>domains</em>, and
then definining a library of <em>domain maps</em> for distributing these
domains over different locality regions (“locales”) (nodes, or NUMA
nodes, or KNL accellerators) and <em>layouts</em> for describing their layout
within a locale.  By far the best tested and optimized domain maps
are for the cases of dense (and to a lesser extent, CSR-layout
sparse) rectangular arrays, as below, although there support for
associative arrays (dictionaries) and unstructured meshes/graphs
as well.</p>

<p>The second is to couple those domain maps with parallel iterators
over the domains, meaning that one can loop over the data in parallel
in one loop (think OpenMP) with a “global view” rather than expressing
the parallelism explicitly as a SIMD-type program.  This decouples
the expression of the layout of the data from the expression of the
calculation over the data, which is essential for productive parallel 
computing; it means that tweaking the layouts (or the dimensionality of
the program, or…) doesn’t require rewriting the internals of the
computation.</p>

<p>The distributions and layouts are written in Chapel, so that users can
contribute new domain maps to the project.</p>

}
delta = max reduce abs(data_new[Dom] - data[Dom]);</code></pre></figure>

</td> </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Chapel also exposes its lower-level parallel computing functionality —
such as remote function execution, fork/join task parallelism — so
that one can write a MPI-like SIMD program by explicity launching 
a function on each core:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="chapel">coforall loc in Locales do 
    on loc do
        coforall tid in 0..#here.maxTaskPar do
            do_simd_program(loc, tid);</code></pre></figure>

<p>At roughly eight years old as a publically available project, Chapel
is a slightly older and more mature language than Julia. However,
the language continues to evolve and there are breaking changes
between versions; these are much smaller and more localized breaking
changes than with Julia, so that most recent example code online
works readily.  As its focus has always been on large-scale parallelism
rather than desktop computing, its potential market is smaller
so has attracted less interest and fewer users than Julia
— however, if you read this blog, Chapel’s niche is one you are
almost certainly very interested in.  The relative paucity of users
is reflected in the smaller number of contributed packages, although
an upcoming package manager will likely lower the bar to future
contributions.</p>

<p>Chapel also lacks a REPL, which makes experimentation and testing
somewhat harder — there’s no equivalent of <a href="https://juliabox.com/">JuliaBox</a>
where one can play with the language at a console or in a notebook.
There is an effort in that direction now which may be made easier
by ongoing work on the underlying compiler architecture.</p>

<h2 id="similarities-and-differences">Similarities and differences</h2>

<h3 id="standard-library">Standard library</h3>

<p>Both <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable">Julia</a> and <a href="http://chapel.cray.com/docs/latest/">Chapel</a>
have good documentation, and the basic modules or capabilities one would expect from languages 
aimed at technical computing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Complex numbers</li>
  <li>Mathematical function libraries</li>
  <li>Random numbers</li>
  <li>Linear algebra</li>
  <li>FFTs</li>
  <li>C, Python interoperability</li>
  <li>Multi-precision floats / BigInts</li>
  <li>MPI interoperability</li>
  <li>Profiling</li>
</ul>

<p>although there are differences - in Julia, Python interoperability
is much more complete (the Julia set example above used matplotlib
plotting, while <a href="https://pychapel.readthedocs.io/">pychapel</a> focuses
on calling Chapel from within python).  Also, Julia’s linear algebra
support is much slicker, styled after Matlab syntax and with a rich
set of matrix types (symmetric, tridiagonal, <em>etc.</em>), so that for
linear solves, say, a sensible method is chosen automatically; the
consise syntax and “do the right thing” approach are particularly
helpful for interactive use<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, which is a primary use-case of Julia.</p>

<p>On profiling, the Julia support is primariy for serial profiling
and text based; Chapel has a very nice tool called
<a href="http://chapel.cray.com/docs/1.14/tools/chplvis/chplvis.html">chplvis</a> 
for visualizing parallel performance.</p>

<h3 id="other-packages">Other packages</h3>

<p>Julia’s early adoption of a package management framework and very
large initial userbase has lead to a <a href="http://pkg.julialang.org/">very large ecosystem</a>
of contributed packages.  As with all such package ecosystems, 
the packages themselves are a bit of a mixed bag – lots are broken or
abandoned, many are simply wrappers to other tools – but there
are also excellent, substantial packages taking full advantage of
Julia’s capabalities that are of immediate interest
to those doing scientific computing, such as 
<a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl">DifferentialEquations.jl</a>
for ODEs, SDEs, and and FEM for some PDEs,
<a href="https://github.com/BioJulia">BioJulia</a> for …</p></div></div>

<p><em>Edit: This article on chess improvement was unexpectedly popular, reaching #2 on Hacker News and being linked to on LifeHacker. Thanks for your patience as I work through all the comments and emails I receive.<br>
</em></p>
<p>Last updated: October 1, 2020</p>
<p>There are many misconceptions about rapid chess improvement. In this post I’m going to lay out a simple but effective way to get good at chess, fast.</p>
<p>This system is based on lessons learned from my own chess improvement and from coaching others. The good news is that you can become better than the vast majority of other players with minimal but targeted effort.</p>
<p><b>What does it mean to be “good” at chess? </b></p>
<p><span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlsen">Magnus Carlsen’s</a></span></span> meteoric rise to the top ranked player in the world (at age 19), the highest chess rating in history (age 22), and as of a few days ago, the title of World Chess Champion (age 22) has brought with it a renewed interest in chess. This is exciting, because Carlsen represents the first real hope of renewing chess’s mass appeal since the days of <span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Fischer">Bobby Fischer</a></span></span><sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>In the context of discussions about Magnus Carlsen, many people mentioned that they enjoyed playing chess but quit because of the sheer time commitment it took to get “good.”</p>
<p>I define “good” as the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile among the player pool you’re competing against. In competitive chess in the United States, that means a United States Chess Federation (USCF) <span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating">Elo rating</a></span></span> of about 1800<sup>2</sup>. If you’re a casual player playing against your friends, my guess is that 90<sup>th</sup> percentile is around 900. Even though I was only rated 1100 when I first began playing competitively, I was already able to beat the vast majority of non-competitive players.</p>
<p>The goal here is to help you get good, fast, with minimal effort.</p>
<p><b>Results with this system</b></p>
<p>I actively trained for a period of about 3.5 years using a (much, much less disciplined) version of this system, during which my rating increased from 1100 to 1950, a 135 fold increase I strength<sup>3</sup>. In one 12 month period I improved from 1198 to 1639. I improved even faster with my quick rating (games with less than 30 minutes per side), where I went from 1001 to 1740 in 15 months (75 fold increase in playing strength).</p>
<p>My first experience using these ideas with other players was in high school, when I began coaching the lowest ranked player in our chess club. Within a few months he had improved so rapidly that he represented the school in the state championships and won every single game in the tournament.</p>
<p>Given that I managed to do this despite my own inexperience and mistakes with studying chess and my own laziness, I’m convinced others can improve much more quickly if they follow this system strictly<sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p><b>The system</b></p>
<p>Since this article is meant for both casual and competitive players, I specify minimum rating requirements when appropriate. If you’re a casual player and this is overkill for your goals, skip to the footnotes for a much simpler system<sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p><span>Playing</span></p>
<p>To improve quickly you need to play often. If you are (or aspire to be) a competitive player, play as many over-the-board (OTB) tournaments as possible. In my heyday I played 3-4 tournaments per month. Online is not enough! Use online games (15 minutes per side or slower) to practice openings or for practice if there is no tournament for a while. If you’re a casual player, play OTB chess with your friends as much as you can, and play online if nobody wants to play with you.</p>
<p>Since I first wrote this post, I’ve received a fair number of questions asking why OTB chess is so important and why online-only is insufficient. IM Andras Toth has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kmdFbyWiTY">an excellent discussion</a> of this topic that explains it better than I could&nbsp; (his channel is also chronically underrated–I highly recommend checking his other videos out!).</p>
<p><span>Tactics</span></p>
<p>I did two types of tactics training. The first was “Chess Vision” and “Knight Sight” exercises, as described in <span><a href="http://www.masschess.org/Chess_Horizons/Articles/2001-01_Sample_400_Points_Part_1.pdf">this article</a></span>. They may sound stupid, but they work. I did these exercises every day for two weeks initially, and then would do them the day of a tournament and once in a while as a refresher.</p>
<p>My primary method of tactics training was using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U0YZ0M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004U0YZ0M&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gautnaru-20&amp;linkId=Y76EOXPI5OJF2DV4">Chess Tactics for Beginners</a>, which is absolutely fantastic. Since it may have compatibility issues with modern OSes, a good alternative is CT Art 4.0 available for both <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chessking.android.learn.ctart4&amp;hl=en_US">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ct-art-4-0-chess-tactics/id1132601225">iOS</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U0YZ0M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004U0YZ0M&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gautnaru-20&amp;linkId=J7V5XFOTBIDIIG2C" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/6105Zn3iBeL._SL1000_.jpg?resize=278%2C278&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="278" height="278" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>If you only buy one thing to help your chess game, this should be it. I did 50 puzzles per day, every day, and once I finished the entire CD I repeated the process six more times. Online tactics sites usually don’t cut it, because they aren’t structured so that you learn based off previous ideas and many don’t incorporate the pedagogical features of Chess Tactics for Beginners/CT Art 4.0. Trust me, paying for the software is worth it.</p>
<p>If I had to recommend a book to accompany such study (which is helpful, since the above software doesn’t actually have any explanatory text), I’d recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1889323276?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=1889323276&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=gautnaru-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chess Tactics for the Tournament Player </a>for intermediate players, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1857443861/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1857443861&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gautnaru-20&amp;linkId=7ALJB5A3ECUHWDEW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Winning Chess Tactics</a> for less experienced players.</p>

<p>I’ll admit, there is a bit of a leap between solving tactics puzzles and applying it to real games–obviously nobody’s going to tell you when a tactic is available, and you won’t be “primed” to find tactics the way you would be when solving a bunch of puzzles. To counteract this I created a binder of puzzles taken from tactics I missed in my games, and reviewed them from time to time.</p>
<p><span>Analysis</span></p>
<p>Analysis is by far the most undervalued part of chess training. As a kid I barely analyzed my games after tournaments, because I was lazy. This was a huge mistake—your games are worth their weight in gold! Learn <span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)">algebraic chess notation</a></span></span> so you can write down your moves, and analyze your games using the method outlined in <span><span><a href="https://www.chess.com/blog/CharlyAZ/a-hardcore-guide-to-analyze-your-chess-games">this article</a></span></span>. Use the analysis phase to brush up on your openings and endgames and practice your strategic play. If possible, have a stronger player go over your games with you after you’ve done your own analysis.</p>
<p>One big mistake is to rely heavily on computers for chess analysis. Too often, players use computers as a crutch to replace their own study of the game. Working through games on your own and trying to find the best moves and ideas is highly instructive. Computer analysis should be done only after you analyze the game on your own, so you can compare your analysis to the computer’s and unearth any mistakes you made in assessing critical positions in the game.</p>
<p><span>Openings</span><b> </b></p>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes players make is to devote massive amounts of time to openings. This is because openings tend to be very concrete, and beginners think that simply memorizing an opening will give them an unassailable advantage over their opponents<sup>6</sup>.</p>
<p>Don’t bother spending any time studying openings outside of analyzing your games. Just make sure you know the basic opening principles. I teach my beginning students simple openings like the <span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_System">London System </a></span></span>as white, and a kingside fianchetto system as black<sup>7</sup>. These openings are simple, solid, can be played against virtually anything.</p>
<p>Once you hit 1600, get a good opening book that gives you both specific moves and the ideas behind the opening. Don’t mindlessly memorize!</p>
<p><em>Openings for White</em></p>
<p>If you’re a d4 player, I highly recommend Cox’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1857444175/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1857444175&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gautnaru-20&amp;linkId=STJDQXBM7GK6XYNM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starting Out: 1. d4!</a><sup>8</sup>. An offbeat alternative is Summerscale’s <a href="https://amzn.to/36pGkPS">A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re an e4 player it gets a bit trickier. The truth is, e4 is simply harder to play than d4 because it’s a lot easier to get in trouble if you don’t play precisely. This makes finding a single volume repertoire book a bit more challening, but here are some options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alburt’s<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1889323209/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1889323209&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gautnaru-20&amp;linkId=AF3LPY4VTPCU6ID3"> Chess Openings for White, Explained.</a> I haven’t personally used it, and I’ve heard some reasonable criticism around some of the lines chosen, but I think for most players it’ll probably be a good starting point.</li>
<li>Emms’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZA2DM12/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00ZA2DM12&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gautnaru-20&amp;linkId=dcee712605ab0911a0fafd2bf00b1532">Attacking with 1. e4</a> is a book I have used and enjoyed during my forays as an e4 player.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re a c4 player, you’ll have to do some research on your own to find a good repertoire book. Being a hipster has its downsides.</p>
<p><em>Openings for Black</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Alburt’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1889323187/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1889323187&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gautnaru-20&amp;linkId=PBISMJGJT42NGJX6">Chess Openings for Black, Explained</a> is a great book.</li>

<p>Obviously this depends on your opening preferences. Even here openings should not be your main focus. I only consult these books when analyzing my games to see where I deviated from established opening theory, occasionally supplemented by a chess database if there’s a line not covered in the book or I’d like to go more in-depth.</p>
<p>And if your first thought is, “Gautam, one of those books was published in 2006! I’ll be using outdated opening theory!” then I’m afraid you’re missing the point. If you’re below master or even International Master level, playing what world champions played in 2006 rather than what they played in 2020 will <em>never</em> be the reason you lose a game. Ever. That simply is not your bottleneck, and the time invested to try to constantly keep up with the latest won’t result in any rating gains.</p>
<p><span>Strategy<br>
</span></p>
<p>Until you hit 1400-1500, you should be picking up strategic play from analyzing your games and going over annotated games. Once you hit that level, I recommend Silman’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1890085022/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1890085022&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gautnaru-20&amp;linkId=5GKXCF6U4LWI7Y24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Amateur’s Mind</a> and Seirawan’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1857443853/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1857443853&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gautnaru-20&amp;linkId=V5IEYHJJ5PL3FC6Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Winning Chess Strategies.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p><span>Annotated Games</span></p>
<p>Go over at least one annotated game a week (and more frequently if you’re a serious competitive player).

<p>I survived the transition to Linux—and you can too</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/12032/1*XXI-kg18liPn4XcfZmoqQQ.jpeg" alt="Photo by [Chris Ried](https://unsplash.com/@cdr6934?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/code?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText)"><em>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@cdr6934?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank">Chris Ried</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/search/photos/code?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></em></p>

<p>Switching from Windows to <a href="https://www.linux.org/" target="_blank">Linux</a> can be really scary. But if you can survive the first few months, the eventual returns are exponential. Here’s how I survived.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Though I am just an amateur in Linux, I was able to survive the transition and indeed benefitted from it. So these are my notes for somebody facing a similar situation.</p></li>

<li><p>Pick <a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> to start with. Choose other flavours once you know better and can decide for yourself.</p></li>

<li><p>Get comfortable with following commands ssh, pwd, ls, cd, mv, cp, scp, grep, find, rm. Tip: you can use <a href="https://tldr.ostera.io/cp" target="_blank">https://tldr.ostera.io/cp</a> to get the list of most frequently used options of these commands.</p></li>

<li><p>Learn to use the | symbol. Using this symbol, you can pass the output of one command as an input to the next command.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-long-version">The Long Version</h2>

<p>In my first company, we were using Windows extensively, whether it was desktop machines we used for development or the servers on which we deployed our code. But when I moved to my <a href="http://azrisolutions.com/?source=gokulnk" target="_blank">second company</a>, it was all in on OSS and hence using Linux was mandatory there. It became a herculean task for me. For the first month or so it was a nightmare.</p>

<p>Having gone through that nightmare and survived it, I am making this list to help others like me who are trying to make this transition.</p>

<h2 id="new-environments">New Environments</h2>

<p>Transitions are hard in general. New environments can be scary. If you’re a Windows user who has never used the command line, then transition to Linux can get really scary. Don’t fret because that is generally the experience of many people who are making this transition. Knowing that others also find it difficult can be really consoling at times.</p>

<p>According to me, the two main reasons that make transitions difficult are: <strong>lack of familiarity</strong> and <strong>fear of screwing up.</strong></p>

<h3 id="lack-of-familiarity">Lack of familiarity</h3>

<p>To address the issue of familiarity, I started using Linux on my office laptop as well as my personal laptop. I started reading blogs about Linux and followed some interesting Linux-related accounts on Twitter. I reached out to people who were good at Linux. I would walk up to their cubicles and ask them to show me their command history. I learned a lot more from this than from reading the blogs. Most of the times, since it’s just muscle memory, the programmers can’t explain it. But their history is a treasure trove.</p>

<p>I would recommend running the following command. You will get many insights into the commands your Linux heroes use frequently.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">history | awk ‘<span>{</span> $1<span>=</span>””; print $0 <span>}</span>’ | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -20</code></pre></div>
<p>Run the command on the terminals of the Linux gurus in your office. Ask them about the commands you are not familiar with and you should be able to learn a lot more than what a couple of books could teach you. Don’t forget that these are battle-tested commands and hence much more valuable than standard examples in blogs. If you cannot understand what the above command does, don’t worry—I’ll explain it later on in the piece.</p>

<h3 id="fear-of-screwing-up">Fear of screwing up</h3>

<p>I have been using Linux for a couple of years but I still have this fear. This fear was multi-fold when I started. One thing that helped me a lot was, I spoke to Linux pros in my company and made a blacklist—a list of commands that I should never use or use with caution. sudo rm -rf was the top of the list. If you are anxious like me you can use <a href="https://github.com/nivekuil/rip" target="_blank">https://github.com/nivekuil/rip</a> on your local machine.</p>

<p>When I was going through the stage of being afraid of screwing up this Youtube user was of great help: <a href="https://www.jacobgoldstein.tk/linux-survival-guide/youtube.com/c/ChrisTitusTech/" target="_blank">ChrisTitus</a>. I wish I had spent more time watching him and learnt a couple more of his tricks. Find your angels and they will help you face your fears.</p>

<p>Now that your fears are addressed, let’s get started.</p>

<h2 id="why-you-should-learn-linux">Why You Should Learn Linux</h2>

<p>There are countless reasons why you should learn Linux. A google search will fetch you thousands of articles about why you should learn Linux, such as “<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-benefits-of-learning-Linux" target="_blank">What are the benefits of learning Linux</a>,” “<a href="https://fossbytes.com/10-reasons-switch-linux-os-right-now/" target="_blank">Why you should switch to Linux</a>” and “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/38zytg/is_it_worth_my_time_to_learn_linux_while_learning/" target="_blank">Is it worth my time to learn Linux while learning programming</a>?” Those three articles are worth a read, but here are my top two reasons why you should learn:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Linux is ubiquitous</strong>: Linux is everywhere. So with or without your knowledge there is a high probability that you are already using or benefitting from Linux. Understanding the basics of Linux can therefore come in handy in many situations. If you are a programmer then that chance is fairly high. A fair number of applications are deployed on Linux servers. So learning it can be a lifesaver.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Linux is versatile</strong>: <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/11396/217036" target="_blank">Both Linux and MAC are built on UNIX.</a> So if you are comfortable with the Linux terminal you should be able to use most of the commands in MAC terminal as well. <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/25463/does-android-really-use-the-same-kernel-as-linux" target="_blank">Android uses the Linux kernel. </a><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/kernel/building.md" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi uses Linux.</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux#Embedded_devices" target="_blank">Many embedded devices use Linux.</a></p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="why-did-you-start-learning-linux">Why Did You Start Learning Linux?</h2>

<p>As we’ve seen, there are many reasons for you to learn Linux. But if you are a programmer, there’s a fair chance that you fall into one of the two following categories:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You read up about the cool things that Linux can do or you heard from a friend who just can’t stop raving about Linux.</p></li>

<li><p>Your laptop or desktop has a non-Unix OS. But your application or website is deployed on a Linux server.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you fall under the first category, you have all the time in the world. So take your sweet little time. If you fall under the second category, then there is a fair chance that you are running against a deadline. So finish the next parts and get your hands dirty.</p>

<h2 id="man-command-is-your-friend-or-is-it">Man Command Is Your Friend. Or Is It?</h2>

<p>One of the first tips you get when you want to learn Linux is “Use man command, it is your friend.” While there is a certain truth to it, it can be overwhelming for many first-time users. All you generally need are the options for the most frequently used scenarios of the command—and that is what is precisely missing from man pages. Luckily for you, there’s a project called <a href="https://tldr.sh/" target="_blank">TLDR </a>which is trying to fix exactly that.</p>

<p>Just compare the outputs of these two commands to see what I mean.</p>

<p><strong>First, output from man pages.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2302/1*0QXjvacgzf1OHvziiX9s2w.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Now the output from TLDR project.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ZrSUDueSxi2uezlLqoq1iQ.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Do you see the difference?</p>

<p>TLDR is like the notes about commands I would have written for myself. I find it very handy. I installed the TLDR using <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">nodejs</a> command sudo npm i -g tldr. If you have not installed nodejs I suggest you do it, as there are many node packages that are very handy. You can install nodejs using <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18-04" target="_blank">this installation manual by Digitial Ocean.</a></p>

<p>I thought of sharing my notes on all the commands in this post, but then I came across a post by Andrew where he covers 101 bash commands:
<a href="https://dev.to/awwsmm/101-bash-commands-and-tips-for-beginners-to-experts-30je#whereis-which-whatis" target="_blank"><strong>101 Bash Commands and Tips for Beginners to Experts</strong>
*Andrew Jan 13 ・39 min readThe commands below are laid out in a more-or-less narrative style, so if you’re just getting…*dev.to</a></p>

<p>He has categorised all the commands and has good examples as well, and I can’t do a better job than that.</p>

<h2 id="learn-about-bash-profiles">Learn About Bash Profiles</h2>

<p>I found bash config files or bash profiles to be handy, so it helps to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/415444/493742" target="_blank">learn the differences and how they work</a>.</p>

<p>One rule of thumb I follow is to add all my configs to .bash_profile and also make sure to load .bashrc within the .bash_profile file. I add my favourite aliases to this file. I keep a basic version of my .bash_profile in my private gist and I download the raw version of that on the servers where I need these.</p>



<h2 id="learn-to-use-emacs">Learn to Use Emacs</h2>

<p>One thing that I look for these days is commonality. This has helped me leverage what I know in multiple scenarios. For example, we are pushing a lot of Javascript in our team as we can use it in multiple scenarios, like our website front end, in browser console to scrape things quickly, debug our front end or learn from other websites, for joining collections in mongodb, and in nodejs for server side.</p>

<p>Stressing commonality helps us “Learn Once, Benefit Multiple Times”—a much greater ROI.</p>

<p>Coming back to Linux, I wanted to decide on a command line editor. I had the options of choosing Nano, Vim, or Emacs. I chose <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html" target="_blank">Emacs</a>.</p>

<p>Most of the commands used in Emacs can also be used in Linux shell. For example, you can use CTRL/CMD+A to go to the beginning of the line on both shell and Emacs. There are many such commands which work in both shell and Emacs. I think this is a huge advantage.</p>

<p>Since it is a command line editor, you can install it easily on any server. On every server where I am root I generally install Emacs. I am not sure if this is a good practice, but I generally find it very convenient. Yes I have decided not to learn Nano or Vim. Roast me for it if you want to.</p>

<h2 id="pipe-it">PIPE It</h2>

<p>Pipe command in Linux lets you use the output of one command as the input of the next command. This can be really helpful once you get the hang of a few Linux commands like grep, sort, awk, uniq, head, and tail. Piping along with these commands is immensely powerful. For example, I never remember what the options are in ls for showing only text files (and I don’t think you should either). I just run the following command.</p>

<pre><code>ls -l | grep txt
</code></pre>

<p>I know this is quick and dirty but it works in most scenarios.</p>

<p>For example, if we look at the history processing command we used in the first section:</p>

<pre><code>history | awk ‘{ $1=””; print $0 }’ | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -20
</code></pre>

<p>We are taking the output of the history command, and we are passing it to awk to remove the line numbers at the beginning of each line from the output. Then we are passing the output to the sort command so that we can sort it. Then we are passing the output uniq command to retain only unique lines along with the number of occurrences. Then we are passing it to sort command to sort it in reverse order. Then we are passing it to head command to list only the top 20 most frequently used commands that are present in our history.</p>

<p>How cool is that?</p>

<h2 id="grep-it">GREP it</h2>

<p>If you are used to SDKs and GUI editors, GREP might seem little limited. But most of the time, the differentiator is that you can chain the output of the grep …</p></div></div>

    </p>
    <p>Most of my work over the past 10 years has involved writing what is often called a <em>wizard</em>.</p>
<p>A wizard is essentially a multi-step process that guides a user through a particular workflow. For example, if you are installing a new application on your computer, the wizard might guide you through the following process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Enter your license registration details</li>
<li>Agree to the software author’s legal terms</li>
<li>Specify an installation location</li>
</ol>
<p>Most web applications provide something similar. If a user needs to input a large amount of data for the application to then run a bunch of calculations, you could of course just provide the user with one big web form. At a certain size though, a single web form can be intimidating and provide a less than ideal user experience. The canonical way to improve the user experience here is to break up the web form into several separate pages. This is another example of a wizard.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://jezenthomas.com/static/img/wizard-diagram.jpg" alt="Forms are easier to digest when they’re split into separate steps"><figcaption>Forms are easier to digest when they’re split into separate steps</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I’ve tried writing wizards in a number of different web technologies, and so far Elm has proven itself as by far the most robust and painless, <em>especially</em> when it inevitably comes to changing some conditional logic to meet the mutable needs of various business processes.</p>
<p>For any small Elm application, project structure is easy. There is no reason why a 1,000 line Elm application can’t live in a single file. In fact this is really how every Elm application ought to begin its life. Start with a single file with the usual boilerplate and the following contents:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single sum type to model all of the messages your application supports</li>
<li>A single model which contains all the application state</li>
<li>A single update function for advancing the application state</li>
<li>A single view function for rendering the application state on the page</li>
</ul>
<p>If your web form is complex enough to warrant being broken into separate pages however, then your application is naturally not going to consist of a small number of lines of code. A common concern among less experienced Elm programmers is that one big sum type for all of your messages becomes unwieldy to maintain. The same is said of having one big shallow record for all of the application state, or one big <code>update</code> function to match all the constructors of the one big <code>Msg</code> type. This is where unnecessary complexity starts to balloon as programmers add <em>clever</em> abstractions and misdirections, usually involving both <code>Html.map</code> and <code>Cmd.map</code>, separate <code>update</code> functions for each logical subsection of your application (usually with noticeably awkward type signatures), and some vague hand-waving in the direction of <em>encapsulation</em> and so-called <em>Clean Code</em>.</p>
<p>I’d argue that this kind of misdirection is almost <em>never</em> what you want. I’d argue further that this applies <em>especially</em> to you if your background is in maintaining complex React/Angular applications, where invented complexity is the status quo and this kind of misdirection is simply what you have become desensitised to.</p>
<p>So if the combination of <code>Html.map</code> and <code>Cmd.map</code> are to be avoided, how can we scale an Elm application without sacrificing developer ergonomics? In short, the tricks to employ are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nested sum types</li>
<li>Nested record types</li>
<li>Nested update functions</li>
<li>Small, composable view functions</li>
<li>Function composition</li>
<li>Lenses</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a look at a more concrete application of these ideas. As an example, we can model the process of a person applying for a bank loan.</p>
<p>The bank will want to ask the applicant a whole bunch of questions, which we could group into three categories:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Personal information</li>
<li>Details on the purpose of the loan</li>
<li>Financial information and creditworthiness</li>
</ol>
<p>This would suggest a three-step wizard or a three-page web form. A reasonable place to begin splitting our application apart into three smaller pieces is in our <code>Msg</code> type.</p>
<h2 id="the-big-msg-type">The Big Msg Type</h2>
<p>The naïve way to model the messages our application should support is with one big sum type, which might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>type Page
  = PersonalInformationPage
  | LoanPurposePage
  | FinancialDetailsPage

type Msg
  -- System-wide messages
  = NoOp
  | SetPage Page
  -- etc…

  -- Personal information
  | SetFirstName String
  | SetLastName String
  | SetAddressLine1 String
  -- …more messages for the personal information page

  -- Purpose of the loan
  | SetPurchaseItemCategory
  | SetPurchaseItemEstimatedValue
  -- …more messages for the loan purpose page

  -- Financial information
  | SetMonthlyIncomeBeforeTax
  | SetMonthlyRentPayment
  -- …more messages about the applicant's financial details</code></pre>
<p>This <em>does</em> work, but at some point it becomes cumbersome to support a large number of constructors. The value for “large” is of course determined by the individual programmer’s personal taste and/or pain threshold. To ease this pain, people typically <em>extract</em> groups of messages into their own separate sum types, which subsequently forces them to write update functions that return a type <em>other</em> than the top-level <code>Msg</code> type.</p>
<p><em>Don’t do that!</em></p>
<p>The way to break these groups of constructors out is by first nesting them inside the <code>Msg</code> type, like this:</p>
<pre><code>type PersonalInformationMsg
  = SetFirstName String
  | SetLastName String
  | SetAddressLine1 String
  -- etc..

type LoanPurposeMsg -- etc…

type FinancialDetailsMsg -- etc…

type Msg
  = NoOp
  | SetPage Page
  | PersonalInformationMsg PersonalInformationMsg
  | LoanPurposeMsg LoanPurposeMsg
  | FinancialDetailsMsg FinancialDetailsMsg</code></pre>
<p>The new message types can live in the same file as the top-level <code>Msg</code> type. They can also be extracted to different files. That’s your choice.</p>
<p>The next thing to tackle is our <code>update</code> function, since it needs to mirror our <code>Msg</code> type.</p>
<h2 id="nested-update-functions">Nested Update Functions</h2>
<p>I’ve seen people advocate for page-specific <code>update</code> functions which take a page-specific model and return a tuple of that page-specific model and a page-specific <code>Cmd Msg</code> equivalent. This is typically where you see <code>Cmd.map</code> sneaking in. These functions almost inevitably end up needing <em>something</em> from the top-level application-wide state, so you’ll often see some type signature like this:</p>
<pre><code>updatePersonalInformation
   : Model
  -&gt; (PersonalInformationModel, Cmd PersonalInformationMsg)
  -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)</code></pre>
<p>This is <em>way</em> too complex already, and this approach doesn’t even actually buy you anything.</p>
<p>The far simpler way to do this is to have every nested <code>update</code> function take a page-specific message, the <em>entire</em> application state, and return the same type for that state along with the top-level <code>Msg</code> type, like this:</p>
<pre><code>updatePersonalInformation : PersonalInformationMsg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
updatePersonalInformation msg model = case msg of
  SetFirstName a    -&gt; -- …
  SetLastName a     -&gt; -- …
  SetAddressLine1 a -&gt; -- …
  -- etc…

update : Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
update msg model = case msg of
  NoOp -&gt; (model, Cmd.none)
  SetPage page -&gt; ({ model | page = page }, Cmd.none)
  PersonalInformationMsg subMsg -&gt; updatePersonalInformation subMsg model
  LoanPurposeMsg subMsg -&gt; updateLoanPurpose subMsg model
  FinancialDetailsMsg subMsg -&gt; updateFinancialDetails subMsg model</code></pre>
<p>No complicated type signatures. No juggling of message types. No <code>Cmd.map</code>. Easy.</p>
<p>Of course the whole point of our <code>update</code> function is to advance the state of our model, and the structure of that model is also something that can swell and become unwieldy, so that’s what we will dissect next.</p>
<h2 id="record-surgery">Record Surgery</h2>
<p>Near the inception of the project, all of our individual bits of state might exist at the top level of our <code>Model</code>, which is typically represented as a record. Perhaps something like this:</p>
<pre><code>type alias Model =
  { page : Page
  , firstName : String
  , lastName : String
  , addressLine1 : String
  -- …more personal information fields

  , purchaseItemCategory : ItemCategory
  , purchaseItemEstimatedValue : Money
  -- …more loan purpose fields…

  -- …and also financial details, and system-wide state, etc…
  }</code></pre>
<p>Like the parts of our project we’ve addressed previously, this also can turn into a bit of a mess as it grows. Both application-wide data and page-specific data are mixed in together which feels a bit haphazard. Fortunately, grouping and extracting these fields is typically rather intuitive. We can start by grouping page-specific parts of the state together, and then group further until it no longer <em>feels</em> messy.</p>
<pre><code>type alias Address =
  { line1 : String
  , line2 : String
  , city : String
  , postcode : String
  -- …
  }

type alias PersonalInformation =
  { firstName : String
  , lastName : String
  , address : Address
  -- …
  }

type alias LoanPurpose =
  { purchaseItemCategory : ItemCategory
  , purchaseItemEstimatedValue : Money
  -- …
  }

type alias FinancialDetails = -- …

type alias Model =
  { page : Page
  , personalInformation : PersonalInformation
  , loanPurpose : LoanPurpose
  , financialDetails : FinancialDetails
  }</code></pre>
<p>The problem now however is that when we wish to update a deeply-nested field, we need to write all of the code to unwrap each level until we arrive at the depth we need. Illustrated another way, let’s say we want to update the first line of the applicant’s address.</p>
<p>Retrieving the value of this field is no problem, as we can use Elm’s dot syntax to succinctly get us all the way there, like this:</p>
<pre><code>model.personalInformation.address.line1</code></pre>
<p>What we <em>can’t</em> do here however is <em>update</em> that field in a similar fashion, <em>i.e.</em>, Elm won’t allow us to write something like this:</p>
<pre><code>-- This won't work
{ model.personalInformation.address | line1 = newLine1 }

-- This also won't work
{ model | personalInformation.address.line1 = newLine1 }</code></pre>
<p>The naïve way to unwrap and subsequently update the field in this record is to write something like this:</p>
<pre><code>updatePersonalInformation : PersonalInformationMsg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
updatePersonalInformation msg model = case msg of
  SetFirstName _ -&gt; -- …

  SetLastName _ -&gt; -- …

  SetAddressLine1 newLine1 -&gt;
    let
        personalInformation =
          …</code></pre></article></div></div>

		<p>Sometimes you encounter a striking figure of speech, comparison or just a metaphor that illustrates some concept in a much better way than anything you knew until now. It's so good you can't let it get unnoticed. In my case, it happened e.g. when I've learned to think about architects as "navigators". Or quite recently, while I was reading a very decent book by <a href="https://twitter.com/rands">Michael Lopp</a> - <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50083106-the-art-of-leadership">"The Art of Leadership: Small Things, Done Well"</a>.</p><p>Speaking about the latter: my epiphany moment happened during chapter IV, entirely dedicated to the author's actionable advice for engineering leaders. The concluding one was about a reasonable alternative to micro-management: Lopp calls it ... <em>"tasting the soup"</em>. And I think it's brilliant and 100% spot-on.</p><p><strong>Tasting the soup</strong> - what does it mean?</p><p>Imagine a professional chef. A chief boss-cook. A reigning monarch of the kitchen (e.g. in a top-notch, highly reputed, Michelin-starred restaurant). (S)he is the person accountable for the quality of the holistic culinary experience here. It's his(/her) reputation at stake if customers are dissatisfied (for any reason). But still, it doesn't mean (s)he does all the job him(/her)self (to guarantee a suitable level of quality) - quite the opposite. There's the talented, hand-picked crew doing all the "dirty" work, while the chef-in-charge:</p><ul><li>tastes</li><li>probes</li><li>verifies</li></ul><p>It's not that (s)he cares only about the final outcome - the 100% ready dish. (S)he engages <u>at all the various stages</u> (of meal preparation): by inspecting raw materials, half-cooked ingredients, nearly ready products about to get the final touch. &nbsp;What's more - the soup is <u>"multi-dimensional"</u> - it has several equally important aspects (to assess separately): consistency, smell, color, temperature, sweetness, bitterness, spiciness, etc.</p><p>Needless to say - the chef can't (&amp; shouldn't) be everywhere, all the time. (S)he <strong>can't assist every elementary activity</strong> - which is good and ... desirable. One <u>should not judge</u> the effect by the activities performed (which are - in many cases - meaningful "implementation" details or just elements of a highly-individualized style) but <strong>by the outcomes and how they match expectations </strong>(stated beforehand).</p><p>That's why (s)he restrains her(/him)self <u>to taste and probe</u> - it's sufficient because of <strong>past, practical experience</strong>. Precisely because of her/his experience, (s)he knows what to expect, whether the chosen direction is correct, whether there's a chance the final product will be edible &amp; satisfactory (aka will meet the given success criteria). (S)he's been there, (s)he's seen that. And as the one who knows what to expect, the chef is more probably able to detect all those very early warning lights and propose corrective actions.</p><p>Let me emphasize it again - micro-managing all the actions is not the way. Even with experience - <strong>it's NOT possible to know all the correct paths</strong>. Never ever. The number (of correct, good enough options) is endless.</p><p>I hope you've already figured it out by yourself - this chef soup tasting story can be easily mapped onto engineering management scenarios. Everything that has been said about the chef above can be directly translated into software development leaders' reality — starting with the role of experience and the importance of probing the effects (the current state of - process, tooling, various stages of deliverable completeness).</p><p>The default mode of an engineering manager's work should NOT be to dive deep into every possible (implementation) detail - it's just not feasible (but necessary in carefully chosen, critical situations that demand a more direct approach because of some warning lights flashing). A good engineering manager has to be able to:</p><ul><li>quickly orient her(/him)self in a situational context</li><li>identify the qualities that need to be assessed at this point</li><li>find a way to inspect them efficiently and objectively</li><li>confront the perceived learnings with expectations and past experience of similar endeavors</li></ul><p>In other words - to <em>"taste the engineering soup"</em>.</p><p>I think this metaphor is useful not just in calibrating your efforts (as an engineer manager), but also (as it's very "visual") can be very helpful in clarifying the meaning and importance of the engineering manager role: why is it needed, what value does it provide and what kind of input can one expect from a person bearing such a role.</p>

<p>The Obama administration inherited a vast economic crisis. They responded with Quantitative Easing, pumping trillions into the finance sector to rescue the banks that had knowingly gambled on bad mortgages, losing so much they were about to go under.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/24/the-fed-launched-qe-nine-years-ago--these-four-charts-show-its-impact.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/24/the-fed-launched-qe-nine-years-ago–these-four-charts-show-its-impact.html</a></p>
<p>At the time, deficit hawks predicted inflation, which is a commonsense prediction: inflation is what happens when the amount of money chasing goods and services goes up faster than the supply of those goods and services, creating bidding wars.</p>
<p>They were right…and wrong. What we got was asset bubbles, especially in housing markets, driving up the price of putting a roof over your head rewarding speculators and landlords, especially Wall Street landlords.</p>
<p>And Obama's handling of the financial crisis put a lot of us under the thumbs of landlords! Obama bailed out the banks, but not the mortgage holders, kicking off waves of foreclosures.</p>
<p>Thanks to lax oversight, banks that had cheated to originate or service mortgages were able to cheat on foreclosures, too – stealing houses from borrowers who were up-to-date on payments or who were entitled to forebearance.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101017014628/http://news.yahoo.com/s/yblog_upshot/20101014/bs_yblog_upshot/is-david-j-stern-the-poster-boy-for-the-foreclosure-mess">https://web.archive.org/web/20101017014628/http://news.yahoo.com/s/yblog_upshot/20101014/bs_yblog_upshot/is-david-j-stern-the-poster-boy-for-the-foreclosure-mess</a></p>
<p>I mean, literally stealing houses by the hundreds or even the thousands. The very same people who created the great financial crisis got bailed out, rather than punished, and used their new lease on life to commit even worse crimes with total impunity.</p>
<p>The houses that were foreclosed (and sometimes stolen) were flipped to Wall Street, who LOVE financial products based on peoples' homes. After all, people will move heaven and earth to keep shelter over their kids' heads.</p>

<p>Corporate landlords built a sturdy, three-legged stool to guarantee the flow of rents to their investors.</p>
<p>I. Jack up rents to consume the majority of tenants' income:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2017/09/wall-street-owns-main-street-literally.html">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2017/09/wall-street-owns-main-street-literally.html</a></p>
<p>II. Cease maintenance, knowing that your tenants have no recourse if their homes are crumbling and unsafe:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-housing-invitation/">https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-housing-invitation/</a></p>
<p>III. Perfect the eviction, heretofore an American rarity:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-03/wall-street-america-s-new-landlord-kicks-tenants-to-the-curb">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-03/wall-street-america-s-new-landlord-kicks-tenants-to-the-curb</a></p>
<p>America's housing crisis – substandard homes rented at unsustainable costs to people who had their own homes stolen from them by the same investors they're currently paying rent to – is a major legacy of QE, and it's definitely inflationary.</p>
<p>But it's a highly selective form of inflation. Many people won't experience it at all: if you owned your house before the crisis and weathered it, the asset bubble has made your home more valuable, while falling interest rates let you refi at rock-bottom rates. You're great.</p>
<p>You're paying less than ever for a home that's worth more than ever, but that's a spillover effect of the main show, which is the process by which millions of Americans were robbed of their homes and then moved into high-priced slums to the benefit of the 1%.</p>
<p>Both Obama and Trump have boasted of the economy's performance since QE, pointing to soaring share prices – share prices that are totally decoupled from company performance. Companies lose money and still gain value.</p>
<p>Indeed, predatory companies (like Grubhub, Postmates, Door Dash and Uber Eats) that destroy profitable companies (restaurants) while still losing money are booming in value.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/18/code-is-speech/#schadenpizza">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/18/code-is-speech/#schadenpizza</a></p>
<p>Investors understand that consumers have no money, due to rising housing costs plus crashing wages, largely thanks to the "gig economy," a polite term for "worker misclassification."</p>
<p>Companies that get bailouts would be stupid to spend the money on jobs or new productive capacity to make stuff no one can afford to buy. Instead, they buy their own shares and declare dividends, driving up share prices.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/20/the-cadillac-of-murdermobiles/#austerity">https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/20/the-cadillac-of-murdermobiles/#austerity</a></p>
<p>We have seen an incredible market bull-run since the Great Financial Crisis, a run that has largely continued since the pandemic. It's the other asset bubble: a bubble in investment assets.</p>
<p>Corporate leaders claim responsibility for these rises, but the reality is that it's the predictable result of bailing out banks and companies rather than workers and homeowners.</p>
<p>Société Générale's analysts say that about half of the stock market's gains since 2008 can be attributed to QE.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/without-qe-the-s-p-500-would-be-trading-closer-to-1-800-than-3-300-says-societe-generale-11604688442">https://www.marketwatch.com/story/without-qe-the-s-p-500-would-be-trading-closer-to-1-800-than-3-300-says-societe-generale-11604688442</a></p>
<p>Top-down bailouts have multiplier effects. The banks are made whole, then they get to steal our houses, then they get to steal our rents, then they get to goose their share prices.</p>
<p>This is how the super-rich got even richer, before and after the pandemic. It's also why the tiny minority of Americans with adequate retirement savings saw them swell – it's another spillover effect of the great upward transfer of national wealth.</p>
<p>Why does all of this matter now? Well, between my writing my first paragraph and this one, Biden was declared, giving us what the Biden campaign signalled would be "Obama's third term."</p>
<p>Biden's taking office amidst a financial crisis that's far worse than 2008.</p>
<p>Biden has a long track-record of giving legislative gifts to the finance sector at the expense of the American people. They called him "The Senator from MNBA" for a reason.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gq.com/story/joe-biden-bankruptcy-bill">https://www.gq.com/story/joe-biden-bankruptcy-bill</a></p>
<p>If he addresses this crisis the same way that he did in 2008 – the way that Congress and the Senate addressed the crisis in 2020 – by bailing out finance, not the public, we're seriously fucked.</p>
<p>Sure, the stock market will continue to rise and rise, as will house prices.</p>
<p>If you are in the 1%, you will get SO MUCH richer. If you're in the 10%, your retirement savings will swell, your mortgage will get cheaper, and your house's value will go up.</p>
<p>For everyone else: evictions, foreclosures, soaring rents, worse wages.</p>
<p>Last week, California voters passed Prop 22, safeguarding the right of gig economy companies to misclassify their workers as contractors and pay them sub-minimum wages, withhold benefits, evade payroll and unemployment taxes, etc.</p>
<p>Uber/Lyft spent $200m to secure that win.</p>
<p>As Prop 22's promoters remind us: Gig work is the new unemployment benefit: it's a private-sector jobs guarantee, work you can get at the tap of your screen. It's a perfect labor market – workers effectively bid to offer the best price to perform servant work for others.</p>
<p>The more workers there are, and the more desperate their situation is, the lower the payments go. A lot of those savings are siphoned off by the (money-losing, stock-soaring) gig companies, but some of it is passed onto customers.</p>
<p>This is by design.</p>
<p>Since the Reagan years, neoliberal regulators and lawmakers have hewed to a radical anti-monopoly theory called "consumer harm." Under "consumer harm," monopolies are only a problem if they drive up prices.</p>
<p>Since gig companies lower prices, they are totally kosher – even if they secure monopolies through predatory pricing.</p>
<p>But there's an even more insidious side to "consumer harm" and the gig economy.</p>
<p>Misclassifying workers as independent contractors converts a brutally exploited workforce into a collection of "small businesses." If they get together and demand higher wages, THEY violate the consumer harm standard. They're a group of companies fixing prices!</p>
<p>We're 12 years into the QE experiment and it has demonstrated the relationship between government money-creation and inflation: inflation isn't the result of government spending, it's the result of government spending that leads to bidding wars.</p>
<p>Giving trillion to the rich created inflation in the things that rich people buy: our houses (out from under us) and stocks.</p>
<p>Now, imagine what a People's Bailout could do.</p>
<p>Imagine replacing the gig economy job guarantee (a workfare program with no workplace protections, job security or minimum wage) with an actual Job Guarantee as described by the economist Pavlina Tcherneva:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/05/the-hard-stuff/#jobs-guarantee">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/05/the-hard-stuff/#jobs-guarantee</a></p>
<p>Federally funded, locally administered: good jobs at inclusive wages that served community needs proposed by community groups and approved by local governments.</p>
<p>Would that be inflationary? Recall that inflation is what happens when the number of buyers goes up and the supply of things they're buying doesn't keep up. Inflation is the result of bidding wars.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>On April 2020, Mark Russinovich announced the release of a new event type for Sysmon version 11.0: event ID 23, File Delete. As indicated by the name, it logs file delete events that occur on the system. In addition to this, another functionality came alongside allowing files marked for deletion to be archived, enabling defenders to track tools being dropped by malware to better understand the actor's capabilities and develop signatures. This article will discuss the internals of Sysmon version 11.11's to gain insight into how it operates and its limitations. I have briefly checked Sysmon version 12.0 as it was released (September 17, 2020) during the writing of this article and the code for this event looks almost identical so the information should still be mostly relevant.</p><p>Before beginning the article, a huge thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/SBousseaden">Samir</a> for the collaborative effort on this journey.</p><p>Let's first understand the conditions for which the file delete event will be triggered. The file events are handled almost entirely by the <code>SysmonDrv.sys</code> driver through the minifilter component. Specifically, it monitors for three I/O request packets (IRP) <code>IRP_MJ_CREATE</code>, <code>IRP_MJ_CLEANUP</code>, and <code>IRP_MJ_WRITE</code> for file creates, complete handle closes (reference count on a file object reaching zero), and writes respectively.</p><h2 id="irp_mj_create">IRP_MJ_CREATE</h2><p>The purpose of this IRP in the context of file deletes is to handle two situations: file overwrites and file deletes using the <code>FLAG_FILE_DELETE_ON_CLOSE</code> option.</p><figure><img src="https://undev.ninja/content/images/2020/09/image-1.png"><figcaption>File overwrite versus <code>FLAG_FILE_DELETE_ON_CLOSE</code></figcaption></figure><p>Sysmon will check first whether the file was opened with <code>FLAG_FILE_DELETE_ON_CLOSE</code>, and if it is, the configuration's filter rules will be matched against. If the conditions are met, the delete event will be created and the file will be archived in the <code>IRP_MJ_CLEANUP</code> request when all the handles to the file are closed.</p><p>On the other hand, if the file already exists and is being opened with overwrite intent (disposition value is either <code>FILE_OVERWRITE</code> or <code>FILE_OVERWRITE_IF</code>), the driver will attempt to open the file with <code>FltCreateFile</code>. If the function fails with <code>STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND</code>, the file doesn't exist and Sysmon will pass it on to be handled as a file create event. Otherwise, if it returns successfully, the target file exists and will be archived immediately, creating the delete event in tandem.</p><h2 id="irp_mj_cleanup">IRP_MJ_CLEANUP</h2><p>As mentioned before, this request is sent when all of the referenced handles to a file have been closed. Sysmon handles this request by checking the <code>DeletePending</code> flag in the file object and archiving the file if it's set. In the case of <code>FLAG_FILE_DELETE_ON_CLOSE</code>, Sysmon will explicitly set the file's delete disposition to true using <code>FltSetInformationFile</code> with <code>FileDispositionInformation</code> before checking the <code>DeletePending</code> flag.</p><figure><img src="https://undev.ninja/content/images/2020/09/image.png"><figcaption>File is archived if <code>DeletePending</code> is set</figcaption></figure><h2 id="irp_mj_write">IRP_MJ_WRITE</h2><p>Sysmon also considers file content overwrites instead of just classic file deletes. To meet this condition, the write must originate from user mode, the write size must be greater than or equal to the size of the target file and the write should start at the zeroth offset.</p><figure><img src="https://undev.ninja/content/images/2020/09/image-2.png"><figcaption>File write should start at offset 0 and be greater than or equal to the file size</figcaption></figure><p>Sysmon will then read the first byte of the file before iterating through each byte of the buffer that will be written. To trigger the file archiving and delete event, all of the bytes must match the first recorded byte. Sysmon refers to this as <em>shredding</em> where all bytes of the overwrite are the same, e.g. <em>AAAAAAA...</em>. </p><p>There is one more condition under <code>IRP_MJ_WRITE</code> which triggers the archive and delete event however, I was unable to trigger or trace the conditions required. Perhaps this would be an upcoming feature?</p><p>Now that the conditions of file delete events have been covered, let's investigate the implementation details.</p><h2 id="file-delete-requirements">File Delete Requirements</h2><p>The first function to cover is one I call <code>CheckAndQueueFileDeleteEvent</code> and its main purpose is to check if the target file should be archived and if a delete event should be logged. It achieves this in several ways with a few initial checks. If any of the following conditions are met, the file delete event will be bypassed:</p><ol><li>The operation is made by the registered service process (should be <code>Sysmon64.exe</code>),</li><li>The delete event was not set in the configuration,</li><li>The target file is a device or directory,</li><li>The file is empty,</li><li>The file's parent directory is the archive directory.</li></ol><p>After these initial checks, the function will retrieve the file's extension using <code>FltParseFileNameInformation</code> and also check if the file is an executable by using a few <code>FltReadFile</code> calls to read the <code>MZ</code> and <code>PE</code> signatures at offset 0 and <code>0x3C</code> respectively. These values are returned back to the caller along with the image file name responsible for the operation.</p><figure><img src="https://undev.ninja/content/images/2020/09/image-3.png"><figcaption>Checking for PE executable signatures</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, it makes a call to a function I labelled <code>QueueFileDeleteEvent</code> to perform a final check if the file should be archived and logged. </p><h2 id="reporting-file-delete-events">Reporting File Delete Events</h2><p>The following represents the proprietary file delete event structure:</p><figure><pre><code>typedef struct _FILE_DELETE_EVENT {
	/*   0 */ ULONG Id;          // 0xF0000000 for file delete.
	/*   4 */ ULONG Size;        // Struct size.
	/*   8 */ PVOID Unk1;
	/*  10 */ PVOID Unk2;
	/*  18 */ HANDLE ProcessHandle;
	/*  20 */ PKSYSTEM_TIME SystemUtcTime;
	/*  28 */ ULONG HashMethod;
	/*  2C */ BOOLEAN IsExecutable;
	/*  30 */ ULONG SidLength;
	/*  34 */ ULONG ObjectNameLength;
	/*  38 */ ULONG ImageFileNameLength;
	/*  3C */ ULONG HashLength;
	/*  40 */ WCHAR StatusString[256];
	/* 240 */ PEPROCESS ServiceProcessHandle;	// Actually a PEPROCESS object.
	/* 248 */ PKEVENT Event;
	/* 250 */ PBOOLEAN IsArchivedAddress;
	/* 258 */ // User SID.
	/* xxx */ // Object name.
	/* xxx */ // Image file name.
	/* xxx */ // File hash.
} FILE_DELETE_EVENT, * PFILE_DELETE_EVENT;</code></pre><figcaption>File delete event structure</figcaption></figure><p>The event is allocated and set in <code>QueueFileDeleteEvent</code>. But besides the obvious purpose of reporting file delete event data, it has another important, secondary purpose. The tenth argument to this function is a pointer that represents the boolean value of whether the target file should be archived. Although this pointer is optional, if it is a valid, non-zero value, this function serves to pass the event data to <code>Sysmon64.exe</code> via an event queue to be checked against the filter conditions provided in the configuration file.</p><figure><img src="https://undev.ninja/content/images/2020/09/image-4.png"><figcaption>Valid tenth argument</figcaption></figure><p>This explains the existence of the <code>Event</code>, <code>IsArchivedAddress</code>, and the <code>ServiceProcessHandle</code> members of the <code>FILE_DELETE_EVENT</code> structure. After intialising these values and the structure, the event is queued in a function I labelled <code>QueueEvent</code> and the thread is blocked using <code>KeWaitForMultipleObjects</code> waiting on either the <code>Event</code> or the <code>Sysmon64.exe</code> process.</p><figure><img src="https://undev.ninja/content/images/2020/09/image-5.png"><figcaption>Thread blocking after queuing file delete event</figcaption></figure><p>To understand this further, we need to know how events are reported from the driver to <code>Sysmon64.exe</code>.</p><h3 id="queueevent">QueueEvent</h3><p>Sysmon utilises a doubly linked list to queue up events. In this article, I will refer to it as <code>g_EventReportList</code>. This function is relatively straightforward, if the event size is not greater than <code>0x3FCB8 + 0x348</code> (40000) it will be appended to <code>g_EventReportList</code>, otherwise, an incorrect event size error will be created. Since we are not concerned about the error event, we'll skip it for brevity.</p><p>An allocation for a new data structure is created to wrap the event argument:</p><pre><code>typedef struct _EVENT_REPORT {
    /*  0 */ LIST_ENTRY ListEntry;
    /* 10 */ ULONG EventDataSize;
    /* 18 */ PVOID EventData;
} EVENT_REPORT, *PEVENT_REPORT;</code></pre><p>The pointer to the event is pointed to by <code>EventData</code> and its size is stored in <code>EventDataSize</code>. After filling this structure, the <code>EVENT_REPORT</code> is appended in <code>g_EventReportList</code> if the number of entries is less than 50000. If there are 50000 entries, the first item in the queue is removed and deallocated.</p><figure><img src="https://undev.ninja/content/images/2020/09/image-10.png"><figcaption>Allocating and appending new event to <code>g_EventReportList</code></figcaption></figure><h3 id="retrieving-events">Retrieving Events</h3><p>Once events are queued, <code>Sysmon64.exe</code> can read them one by one through the driver's device control dispatch with the I/O control code <code>0x83400004</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://undev.ninja/content/images/2020/09/image-11.png"><figcaption>Reading the first event on the queue through the device control dispatch</figcaption></figure><p>In the context of the file delete event, <code>Sysmon64.exe</code> will check for a valid <code>Event</code> member.</p><figure><img src="https://undev.ninja/content/images/2020/09/image-12.png"><figcaption><code>Sysmon64.exe</code> checking for valid <code>Event</code> member</figcaption></figure><p>If it's valid, a filter check will be performed to determine if the target file object should be archived and a file delete event launched. The following data structure will be initialised and sent to the driver:</p><pre><code>typedef struct _SET_ARCHIVED_INFO {
    /*  0 */ BOOLEAN IsArchived;
    /*  8 */ PEPROCESS ServiceProcessHandle;	// Service process.
    /* 10 */ PKEVENT Event;
    /* 18 */ PBOOLEAN IsArchivedAddress;
} SET_ARCHIVED_INFO, *PSET_ARCHIVED_INFO;</code></pre><p>The <code>IsArchived</code> value is set depending on the return value of the function that checks for filter matching. Using <code>DeviceIoControl</code>, Sysmon will send the above structure back to the driver with the <code>0x83400010</code> I/O control code.</p><figure><img src="https://undev.ninja/content/images/2020/09/image-14.png"><figcaption><code>Sysmon64.exe</code> responding with whether the file should be logged</figcaption></figure><p>Back in the driver's device control dispatch, the value in <code>IsArchivedAddress</code> will be set to <code>IsArchived</code> (!) before signalling the event to unblock <code>QueueFileDeleteEvent</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://undev.ninja/content/images/2020/09/image-15.png"><figcaption>Device control dispatch setting <code>IsArchived</code> value and signalling <code>QueueFileDeleteEvent</code>'s wait</figcaption></figure><p>Once <code>QueueFileDeleteEvent</code> is signalled and unblocked, it will return the <code>IsArchived</code> value back through the tenth argument which is then returned again from <code>CheckAndQueueFileDeleteEvent</code>.</p><p>The return value is used in two locations: the <code>IRP_MJ_CREATE</code> with <code>FLAG_FILE_DELETE_ON_CLOSE</code> and in the <code>ArchiveFile</code> function. The former triggers the file delete event and archiving in the <code>IRP_MJ_CLEANUP</code> request by setting the <code>CompletionContext</code> value to <code>1</code> so that it can be handled in the minifilter's post operation.</p><figure><img src="https://undev.ninja/content/images/2020/09/image-16.png"><figcaption>Notifying post operation to handle <code>FLAG_FILE_DELETE_ON_CLOSE</code> files</figcaption></figure><p>The post operation routine simply allocates and sets a …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>Over the next few weeks (maybe months — blame my vacation), I plan to focus on decision making. It's a subject I'm passionate about because it was life-changing from the moment I started paying attention to it. Not only in my financial life (this is a financial blog) but also in my career and my relationships. My goal here is to (hopefully) introduce you to some new concepts, and get you excited about making decisions. You won't learn it all here. I'll link additional books and resources that can help you further your understanding at the bottom of each post. As always, reply to the newsletter or email me if you have questions.</p><hr><p>Every decision you make is a bet. Saying yes to something is betting on the future you expect by making that choice. Similarly, you're betting against the alternate realities where you provided a different answer. Not all decisions require contemplating. Ice-cream or no ice-cream, for example, won't result in drastically different futures. Not unless your potential soulmate is the one selling the ice-cream. It's not all deep, but sometimes it is. Some of the 'small' decisions I made in the past turned out to be huge leaps in retrospect. Like me, you won't know it at the time. But hindsight is twenty-twenty, therefore it's important to make fewer bad decisions.</p><hr><p>Annie Duke's <a href="https://amzn.to/3jCpX5E"><em>Thinking in Bets</em></a> has arguably had the most influence on how I view odds. The book tries to help you make smarter decisions when you do not have all the facts. It is one of the few books I continue to recommend — I've read it more than once (this is rare). Let's say you're having an ardent conversation with a friend about who will be the NBA Finals MVP. You could continue to go back and forth for hours or you could ask them: <strong><em>Wanna Bet?</em></strong> It's a simple and effective way to cut an argument like this one short. Talk is cheap (monetarily and mentally). Anyone can say anything as long as there's nothing to lose. The bet only gets interesting if something valuable is at risk. It could be money, reputation, or a future favor.</p><h3 id="wanna-bet">Wanna Bet?</h3><p>Consider the following statement: <em>LeBron will definitely be the NBA finals MVP next year</em>. Play along here; forget how you feel about James and the Lakers for a few minutes. It doesn't cost you anything to be wrong, therefore uttering that statement didn't require any critical thinking. But what if something is at stake? How much between $100 and $10,000 would you be willing to bet on your position? There's a good chance you'd want to take a step back to evaluate the odds. Maybe you are not $10,000 sure, but you are sure enough to bet $100.</p><p>If you're still willing to bet $10,000, you either don't value the money, or you have some hidden information about the outcome of the NBA season and the fate of its athletes. But what if you don't have all the facts? What if, like me, you can't predict the future? How do you approach betting? &nbsp;Now that you're thinking, the statement now reads... <em>LeBron will likely be the NBA finals MVP next year.</em></p><blockquote>We process information to support our beliefs instead of using it to calibrate our beliefs - Annie Duke (Some Podcast)</blockquote><h3 id="calibrate-your-belief">Calibrate Your Belief</h3><p>The chances that LeBron James will be the Finals MVP isn't a yes or a no question. Contrary to how we've been wired in school, most questions can't be answered with true or false. The world is more complicated than that. LeBron James could get injured. The Lakers may not execute as well as they did this season. The season could be postponed due to some unforeseen circumstance like a virus, war, or aliens. Before you finish laughing at the part about aliens, remember that unknown information can have an outsized impact on the outcome of your decisions.</p><blockquote>Remember that the things we don't expect tend to have asymmetric impacts on our lives compared to what we prepare for. This is especially true in a year like 2020, but keep it in mind moving forward.</blockquote><p>Stop thinking in black and white or right and wrong. <strong>You should try thinking in percentages instead.</strong> Sure, the outcome is binary. At the end of the season, LeBron will either have the MVP title or not. But the road to each of those realities isn't as clear. James is going to fall somewhere between the most undeserving player and the most deserving player in the NBA. It's difficult to know for sure because luck plays a big role here. But the answer isn't either 0 or 1, it is somewhere between. Try to calculate the odds by breaking down the statement.</p><ol><li>What are the chances that the Lakers will make the playoffs? Don't ignore the other teams; even 'bad' ones can surprise you.</li><li>What are the chances that they will make the finals? What other teams have a good chance?</li><li>What are the chances that the Lakers win it all?</li><li>What are the chances that LeBron James will be chosen? It could go to another teammate or a player on the losing team. (Rare, but it's happened before)</li></ol><p>If you're interested in how to come up with these parts and how to combine them, I recommend reading <a href="https://amzn.to/3jIbNQj">Superforecasting</a>. It's a great book to start with.</p><p>At the end of this step, the statement should read: <em>I'm 90% sure that LeBron will <s>definitely</s> be the NBA finals MVP next year.</em></p><h3 id="should-you-bet">Should You Bet?</h3><p>Be careful when asking people to bet; it can backfire. Usually, I win stalemates with my girlfriend by asking her to bet on her position. She'd agree, then I'd raise the stake till she backed off. But she caught on quickly. She realized that I was raising the stakes because I wasn't as certain with my odds. She figured out that I was taking advantage of her risk averseness. After that, she flipped the game on me and took whatever amount I presented. She'd smile with her hands drawn to lock in the bet with a handshake no matter how high the stake. I ask her to bet less frequently now after losing a few rounds.</p><p>Money is a weird topic for a lot of people. Personally, I view money differently and believe it should be a casual topic. You probably do too if you're reading this. But most people won't be pleased if you continually ask them to bet. Alternatively, you can shake on it for a chance to be right in the future. Depending on how you view the other participant, this feeling (or vindication) can be more rewarding.</p><p>You can also do this exercise with yourself. No one else has to be included. You can bet yourself how much you'd throw into your retirement account if things don't go your way. The whole point of this is to change your thinking, not to continually ask people (yourself included) 'Wanna Bet?' It's to get you to start questioning your beliefs. Start to consider what the other party knows that you don't. Start wondering why you may be wrong instead of searching for evidence that only supports your position.</p><h2 id="delve-deeper">Delve Deeper</h2><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3jCpX5E"><em>Thinking in Bets</em></a> - Annie Duke<br><a href="https://amzn.to/3jIbNQj">Superforecasting</a> - Philip Tetlock &amp; &nbsp;Dan Gardner<br><a href="https://fs.blog/">Farnam Street Blog &amp; Podcast</a></p><figure><a href="https://tolusnotes.com/how-to-bet-2/"><div><p>Illusion Of Understanding — Know What You Don’t Know (How to Bet #2)</p><p>How to avoid one of the biggest pitfalls in decision making — the illusion of understanding.</p><p><img src="https://tolusnotes.com/favicon.ico"><span>Tolu's Notes</span></p></div><p><img src="https://tolusnotes.com/content/images/2020/11/Blog-Post-1-.png"></p></a></figure><hr><p>

                     those who decided to study theoretical physics, in their own time.</b></p>

                  <p>It so often happens that I receive mail - well-intended but totally useless - by amateur physicists who believe to have solved the world. They believe this, 
                     only because they understand totally nothing about the real way problems are solved in Modern Physics. If you really want to contribute to our theoretical 
                     understanding of physical laws - and it is an exciting experience if you succeed! - there are many things you need to know. First of all, be serious about 
                     it. All necessary science courses are taught at Universities, so, naturally, the first thing you should do is have yourself admitted at a University and 
                     absorb everything you can. But what if you are still young, at School, and before being admitted at a University, you have to endure the childish anecdotes 
                     that they call science there? What if you are older, and you are not at all looking forward to join those noisy crowds of young students?</p>

                 <p>It should be possible, these days, to collect all knowledge you need from the internet. Problem then is, there is so much junk on the internet. Is it possible 
                    to weed out those very rare pages that may really be of use? I know exactly what should be taught to the beginning student. The names and topics of the absolutely 
                    necessary lecture courses are easy to list, and this is what I have done below. It is my intention to search on the web where the really useful papers and books 
                    are, preferably downloadable as well. This way, the costs of becoming a theoretical physicist should not exceed much the price of a computer with internet connection, 
                    a printer, and lots of paper and pens. Unfortunately, I still have to recommend to buy text books as well, but it is harder to advise you here; perhaps in a future 
                    site. Let’s first limit ourselves to the absolute minimum. The subjects listed below must be studied. Any omission will be punished: failure. Do get me right: you 
                    don’t have to believe anything you read on faith - check it. Try alternative approaches, as many as you can. You will discover, time and again, that really what 
                    those guys did indeed was the smartest thing possible. Amazing. the best of the texts come with exercises. Do them. find out that you can understand everything. 
                    Try to reach the stage that you discover the numerous misprints, tiny mistakes as well as more important errors, and imagine how you would write those texts in a 
                    smarter way.</p>

                <p>I can tell you of my own experiences. I had the extreme luck of having excellent teachers around me. That helps one from running astray. It helped me all the way 
                   to earn a Nobel Prize. But I didn’t have internet. I am going to try to be your teacher. It is a formidable task. I am asking students, colleagues, teachers to 
                   help me improve this site. It is presently set up only for those who wish to become theoretical physicists, not just ordinary ones, but the very best, those who are 
                   fully determined to earn their own Nobel Prize. If you are more modest than that, well, finish those lousy schools first and follow the regular routes provided by 
                   educators and specialized -gogues who are so damn carefully chewing all those tiny portions before feeding them to you. This is a site for ambitious people. I am 
                   sure that anyone can do this, if one is gifted with a certain amount of intelligence, interest and determination. Now, here begins the serious stuff. Don’t complain that 
                   it looks like being a lot. You won’t get your Nobel Prize for free, and remember, all of this together takes our students at least 5 years of intense study (at least 
                   one reader was surprised at this statement, saying that (s)he would never master this in 5 years; indeed, I am addressing people who plan to spend most of their time 
                   to this study). More than rudimentary intelligence is assumed to be present, because ordinary students can master this material only when assisted by patient teachers. 
                   It is necessary to do exercises. Some of the texts come with exercises. Do them, or better, invent your own exercises. Try to outsmart the authors, but please refrain 
                   from mailing to me your alternative theories until you have studied the entire lot; if you do this well you will discover that many of these authors were not so stupid 
                   after all.</p>

               <p>Theoretical Physics is like a sky scraper. It has solid foundations in elementary mathematics and notions of classical (pre-20th century) physics. Don’t think that 
                  pre-20th century physics is “irrelevant” since now we have so much more. In those days, the solid foundations were laid of the knowledge that we enjoy now. Don’t 
                  try to construct your sky scraper without first reconstructing these foundations yourself. The first few floors of our skyscraper consist of advanced mathematical 
                  formalisms that turn the Classical Physics theories into beauties of their own. They are needed if you want to go higher than that. So, next come many of the other 
                  subjects listed below. Finally, if you are mad enough that you want to solve those tremendously perplexing problems of reconciling gravitational physics with the 
                  quantum world, you end up studying general relativity, superstring theory, M-theory, Calabi-Yau compactification and so on. That’s presently the top of the sky 
                  scraper. There are other peaks such as Bose-Einstein condensation, fractional Hall effect, and more. Also good for Nobel Prizes, as the past years have shown. A 
                  warning is called for: even if you are extremely smart, you are still likely to get stuck somewhere. Surf the net yourself. Find more. Tell me about what you found. 
                  If this site has been of any help to someone while preparing for a University study, if this has motivated someone, helped someone along the way, and smoothened his 
                  or her path towards science, then I call this site successful. Please let me know. Here is the list.</p>

              <p>Note that this site NOT meant to be very pedagogical. I avoid texts with lots of colorful but distracting pictures from authors who try hard to be funny. Also, the 
                 subjects included are somewhat focused towards my own interests.</p>

<p>LIST OF SUBJECTS, IN LOGICAL ORDER ARE ON THE SIDE.
(Not everything has to be done in this order, but this approximately indicates the logical coherence of the various subjects. Some notes are at a higher level than others).</p>

November 7, 2020 | https://blog.min.io/the-long-term-costs-of-storage-in-the-cloud/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.min.io/the-long-term-costs-of-storage-in-the-cloud/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                    <p>The promise/allure of the public cloud is based on the concept that it is elastic. One can, with little effort, scale up workloads and, if desired, scale down those same workloads. We have <a href="https://blog.min.io/repatriation_wave/">written on this subject before</a> - from the perspective of what workloads to consider as you evaluate what to take to the public cloud and what to repatriate to the private cloud. <br></p><p>We have not, however, taken a hard look at the costs associated with the two options. Our position can be related as an analogy. The public cloud is like a nice hotel. Plenty of amenities, secure, spacious etc. It is priced like a nice hotel too. As a result, people don’t live in nice hotels - they stay there for a period of time to achieve a certain objective (business trip, vacation) because it gets too expensive otherwise. <br></p><div><p>We wanted to quantify this objectively so we rolled up our sleeves, made some reasonable assumptions and wrote this post. Here we go:</p><p>If we assume that we will be using object storage in the cloud and want to understand the costs of deploying a PB of data (200TB active, 800TB inactive, with a Read:Write ratio of 80:20) we can compute what this storage would cost on various public clouds.</p></div><p>AWS S3 storage tiers costs are as follows (See <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/">https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/</a>). This should not be a surprise as prices have not changed in the last four years (but costs have :).<br></p><ul><li><strong>S3 Standard</strong> storage the first 50TB costs $0.023 per month per GB, the next 450TB costs $0.22 per month per GB, and all storage over 500TB costs $0.021 per month per GB. So 1PB of S3 Standard storage would cost $1.2K/month for the 1st 50TB, $9.9K/month for the next 450 TB and $10.3K/month for the next 500TB or <strong>$21.6K/month for 1PB of data</strong>.</li><li><strong>S3 Intelligent Tiering </strong>storage costs the same as S3 Standard for frequently active data and $0.0125 for infrequently accessed data plus an $0.0025 per 1000 Objects fee for management. So assuming 200TB:800TB active:inactive the active data would cost $1.2K/month for 50TB and $3.3K/month for the 150TB and $10.0K for the inactive 800TB. To that, we must add object management costs. It’s not unusual to see PB data warehouse with billions of objects/files. So if we assume 1B objects (average ~1MB/object) in our PB of data object management costs would be $2.5K per month. Totaling all that together we have an overall <strong>storage and object management costs of</strong> ~<strong>$17.0K per month for our 1PB of data</strong>. <br></li></ul><p>It is true one could do a blend of standard S3 plus S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive, but that doesn’t really get to the apples to apples comparison we are seeking. So for the purposes of this we will consider the first two. <br></p><p>Although Azure and GCP don’t have exactly equivalent tiers of storage, if we just focus on S3 Standard equivalents then Azure Blob and GCP cloud storage costs are:</p><ul><li>Azure (Hot) Blob storage <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/storage/blobs/">costs</a> a flat $0.0184 per GB per month or $18.4K per 1PB per month, or about 85% of AWS S3 standard costs.</li><li>GCP us-central cloud storage costs are $0.020 per GB per month or $20K for 1PB per month or about 93% of what AWS S3 standard costs. <br></li></ul><p>There are some additional costs that are associated with per 1,000 S3 operations. But we estimate in the scheme of things they don’t add more than $300/month to the above costs. As such we will ignore these costs here.</p><h3 id="what-if-we-wanted-to-copy-the-data-out-of-the-cloud">What if we wanted to copy the data out of the cloud?</h3><p>Of course none of the above cloud storage costs takes into consideration any egress charges which for AWS and GCP are $0.09 to $0.05/GB per month and $0.12/GB, respectively. So if you wanted to move the active 200TB of your 1PB of data out of the (AWS or GCP) cloud each month you would need to add it would cost you another ~$14K/month (on average) with AWS S3 and $24K/month with GCP. <br></p><p>For Azure they don’t appear to have a standard egress charge but rather charge per operation and bandwidth used. We would guess (although we haven’t verified this) that the costs would be comparable to AWS S3 standard egress charges. <br></p><p>Of course there would be no direct charge to move the 1PB of data center data around. You would incur bandwidth costs depending on where you moved it. But the server costs are already accounted for in the costs above. <br></p><h3 id="the-private-cloud-onprem-equivalents-software">The Private Cloud/OnPrem Equivalents: Software</h3><p>First off, you need equivalent software. MinIO offers that (and more) with its S3 compatible, feature rich object storage suite. It is literally a private cloud, drop-in equivalent for AWS. While MinIO is open source, it does offer two tiers for the MinIO Subscription Network. SUBNET, as we call it, combines a commercial license with 24/7/365 direct-to-engineer support, security and resilience audits and other diagnostic technologies that effectively insure production deployments of our software. <br></p><p>The Standard tier is priced at .01 per GB per month and the Enterprise tier is priced at .02 per GB per month.<br></p><p>For our PB of data, that equates to 10K and 20K per month respectively. Needless to say, there is the open source option as well, which would be appropriate if your data was not mission critical. That cost is zero.</p><p>There are no egress costs. There are no per object management costs. <br></p><p>For the purposes of this exercise let’s choose the middle - the Standard plan at <strong>$10K per month for software costs.</strong></p><h3 id="the-private-cloud-onprem-equivalents-hardware">The Private Cloud/OnPrem Equivalents: Hardware</h3><p>While MinIO can run on a range of hardware from Raspberry Pis to IBM Power, we wanted to target dense JBODs for the purposes of our analysis. <br></p><p>It just so happens that through our partnership with Seagate, we have publishable pricing for a 1TB configuration of the Exos AP 2U12 (Dual AP) with two Intel Silver Xeon CPUs. It has</p><p>60 drives at 16 TB per drive delivering .96 PB raw capacity and .72 actual capacity. This assumes erasure coding factor of .75. The price for that hardware is a very reasonable $70K. Let’s choose a three year amortization schedule on that hardware to determine a monthly per GB cost. At 36 months our monthly cost for the hardware works out<strong> to $1,510 per month or $0.0015 GB/month</strong>. <br></p><p>Interested in more? Jump over to the <a href="https://min.io/product/reference-hardware#pricing-calculator">Reference Hardware page to play with the calculator</a> to see other capacities. <br></p><h3 id="don-t-forget-the-data-center-costs">Don’t Forget the Data Center Costs</h3><p>For a data center deployment, we would need to add administration, rack, space, power and cooling costs. We could go into great detail here to determine each of these costs but in general according to the US Chamber of Commerce <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/ctec_datacenterrpt_lowres.pdf">data center space</a> can be had for about $1305/NRSF (net rentable square feet) in CapEx and another $112/NRSF ( ~8.6% of CapEx) in OpEx or a total of ~$1.4K/NRSF annual cost or an extra $116 per month. <br></p><h3 id="totaling-up-the-private-cloud">Totaling Up the Private Cloud</h3><p>The cost to run your own, 1 PB private cloud, with state of the art hardware, 24/7 direct-to-engineer support, panic button access and annual performance reviews is <strong>$11,510 per month</strong>. Let’s circle back and compare that to what we calculated above.</p><h3 id="summarizing-the-one-year-costs">Summarizing the One Year Costs</h3><p>At $11,510 MinIO and Seagate represent the best economics - by a considerable amount. The combination is 47% less expensive per month than standard S3 and 33% less than S3 with Intelligent Tiering. <br></p><p>These calculations ignore AWS egress costs - which would make MinIO and Seagate less than half as expensive as Standard S3. <br></p><p>MinIO and Seagate are also 38% less than Azure’s comparable option and 43% less than Google Cloud Platform’s comparable offering. <br></p><p>The breakeven point for building your own private cloud vs. S3 Standard comes in at seven months. Thought of another way - for the price of 1PB on S3 Standard you could have almost 1.5 PBs of MinIO and Seagate.</p><p><br>The overall point is not to compete on price. </p><p>We think it is a <a href="https://blog.min.io/the-new-metrics-of-object-storage/">poor metric</a> when thinking about object storage. What we seek to detail here, is that, over time, you will get better performance, superior security, more control and additional flexibility by going on prem - without sacrificing anything on cost (indeed you gain economic advantage). That is why many innovative enterprises are engaged in large scale repatriation strategies, because they realize the cloud is here to stay and they have a choice about what cloud that is - and they are picking the private cloud.</p><p>Feel free to disagree with us. You can reach out at hello@min.io. </p><p>Feel free also to put us to the test. &nbsp;You can contact a Seagate rep from the <a href="https://min.io/product/reference-hardware#pricing-calculator">calculator</a> and <a href="https://min.io/download#/macos">download our software here</a>.

<p>Modern marketing is all about data and however hard you might try, you can't spend any time around marketers online without <a href="https://blog.marketo.com/2013/11/prove-your-worth10-kpis-for-marketers.html">being</a> <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/paid-owned-earned-content/242075/">subjected</a> <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/oracledatacloud/effectively-measuring-advertising-performance-your-guide-to-success">to</a> <a href="https://searchengineland.com/using-auction-insights-for-better-ppc-competitor-analysis-343264">endless</a> <a href="https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2020/07/28/10-reasons-why-marketers-use-data-to-make-budgeting-decisions/">think</a> <a href="https://www.oberlo.co.uk/blog/spent-200000-facebook-ads-heres-learned">pieces</a>, how-to guides, ebooks or other dreck about how we need to track and measure and count every little thing.</p>
<p>We've got click rates, impressions, conversion rates, open rates, ROAS, pageviews, bounces rates, ROI, CPM, CPC, impression share, average position, sessions, channels, landing pages, KPI after never ending KPI.</p>
<p>That'd be fine if all this shit meant something and we knew how to interpret it. But <em>it doesn't</em> and <strong>we don't</strong>. </p>
<p>The reality is much simpler, and therefore much more complex.  Most of us don't understand how data is collected, how these mechanisms work and most importantly where and how they <em>don't</em> work.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/874736/ad-blocker-usage-in-united-kingdom/">36% percent of people in the UK</a> use an adblocker, which means your javascript based website tracking is meaningless</li>
<li>Email open rates <a href="https://developermedia.com/email-open-rates-misleading-metrics-best-practices-2/">don't <em>actually</em> indicate that an email was opened</a>, merely that a request was made to a server</li>
<li>The black boxes inside Facebook and other ad exchanges give you <a href="https://www.etcentric.org/facebook-agrees-to-40-million-fine-for-incorrect-ad-metrics/">flat out wrong</a> data about how your ads are performing</li>
<li>The audiences you're targeting on Google, Bing, etc <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/augustinefou/2020/11/02/got-large-budgets-you-need-to-spend-fraudsters-will-help-you-spend-it/?sh=54b93f867a9f">are fraudulent</a> and don't even exist</li>
<li>The exchanges you're purchasing media space from are <a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/mobile/is-ubers-new-ad-fraud-lawsuit-futile-or-game-changing/">cheating you</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And even if we know how the data is collected, what it means and what it's actually tracking, most of us don't have the technical chops to analyse the data we've collected<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. I don't mean to rag on anyone by saying this, but we do need a reality check.</p>
<p>And look. I get it. Having tangible data allows us to demonstrate that we're doing our job and we're trying to measure and improve what we're doing. But as Bob Hoffman rightly points out - <a href="http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/2020/09/the-mystery-of-modern-media.html">that's not how brands are built</a>. </p>
<p>The numbers are often all we have to prove our case, to get more budget and in extreme cases, to continue to stay employed. We'll remain in this mess until we can separate marketing from short sighted and poorly informed decision making. Until leaders can lead on the strength of their conviction and experience instead of second guessing themselves and their staff based on the inadequacy of data.</p>
<p>I don't know what the way out of this mess is, or what the path to success looks like. All I know is this.</p>
<p><em>We're addicted to bad data</em>.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Panelbear grew out of a side-project of mine as I didn't feel at home in any of the existing analytics solutions. I wanted the power and flexibility of a complete toolkit, without complicated dashboards or invading the privacy of my visitors.</p><p>They say “data is the new gold”, and data is what fuels any analytics tool out there. My aim is to build a complete toolkit that puts your website’s data to work for you and not for the mega corporations. Panelbear aims to become the hub for your analytics, giving you automated insights and the features growing businesses need, while remaining private by design.</p><h2>Privacy by design</h2><p>I found it unnecessarily time consuming to keep up with the nightmare of cookie banners, legal notices, and keeping records of consent, when all I really wanted was to understand how my website is being used. Tools like Google Analytics are powerful but you’re giving up the personal data of your visitors and one your most valuable assets: your website’s data.</p><p>My tools should respect the privacy of my visitors by design, and it shouldn't depend on me checking the right boxes in some obscure UI or following lengthy manuals. Unfortunately, keeping up with privacy regulations is almost a full time job, and for small business owners this creates a huge disadvantage.</p><p>The principles of privacy are fantastic, but we won’t enjoy the widespread benefits unless they’re simple enough to follow and do not “dumb down” the tools that bring a lot of value to our businesses.</p><h2>Use your time for something meaningful</h2><p>Joe Armstrong once said: "You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle". As a small business owner, this is exactly how it feels like to keep up with the ever-changing privacy regulations.</p><p>You see, if you own a website, you probably need to have visibility into what’s going on to be able to improve it over time. Things like:</p><ul><li>How many visitors come each day?</li><li>Which pages are trending?</li><li>What are the top countries?</li><li>How fast is my site loading in each country?</li></ul><p>At this point, you are probably thinking of using something like Google Analytics, but then you have to worry about ensuring your setup is fully compliant with privacy regulations like GDPR, or things like the transfer of personal data between EU-US. Fines are pretty big even for small websites, not to mention that many of these tools invade the privacy of your visitors, and may even sell your data to third-parties. Have you heard of the phrase: "if you're not paying for the product, you are the product"?</p><p>Soon you find yourself in a nightmare of using various third-parties for things like cookie banners, keeping records of consent and a complicated setup when all you really wanted was to understand how your website is being used, not to track the personal data of your visitors and fuel the already huge corporations that possess them.</p><p>So after trying out most privacy-friendly solutions out there, I never felt at home with them. They were doing either too little, or too much for my needs. Having worked for several years building large-scale infrastructure for one of Europe’s largest search platforms, I decided to take the challenge and started building Panelbear on the weekends next to my full-time job.</p><h2>Getting better all the time</h2><p>There’s plenty of other analytics services out there, and while Panelbear offers similar features, the aim is to become a more complete toolset for your website, one new feature at a time.</p><p>Many of the alternatives focus on being simplified versions of Google Analytics, and I respect them, you as a customer have more options now than ever. But there’s more features that I’d like to have as part of my toolset, and I would prefer to not require five different services to get each feature (such as performance metrics). For example, here are some ideas I've been bouncing around with early customers:</p><ul><li>Automated insights (for example "Your signup page has a higher bounce rate than normal this week" or "Visitors coming from Twitter spend 50% more time on your website.").</li><li>Performance metrics (such as time to first paint and Apdex scores).</li><li>Privacy-friendly link shortening with statistics.</li></ul><p>If you own a Panelbear account, you probably noticed that every single week there’s a new feature or improvement that makes your life easier as a website owner. It’s getting better all the time, and we’re just getting started.</p><h2>How can it be free and private?</h2><p>Panelbear offers a very generous free plan which includes 10,000 pageviews per month for unlimited websites. For my full-time job I work together with teams that build large scale multi-regional infrastructure, and this helped me understand and optimize the technical and operational aspects of Panelbear to the point that sustaining a free plan became possible.</p><p>What’s in it for Panelbear? My strategy is a simple one: if I deliver a ton of value in a simple package, it would help me get the word out, and eventually this may translate into customers with larger websites getting to know my product and subscribing to a paid plan that supports the business. It’s really that simple, and there’s no ulterior motive.</p><h2>What’s in it for you?</h2><p>It’s super encouraging that many of Panelbear's customers have reached out on Twitter or via email to share their support. Some of the things they appreciate are:</p><ul><li>Super simple setup</li><li>No cookie notice needed</li><li>Really fast dashboards</li><li>Site speed metrics</li><li>Simple pricing, flexible upgrades</li><li>Friendly support - at least that’s what I’m told :)</li></ul><p>Regarding pricing based on usage: there are no hidden fees or charges for traffic spikes if your site suddenly becomes popular. Panelbear is a small business too, so I understand that you need flexibility as well. You simply book the volume you predict you will need and we can adjust it as you go.</p><p>I feel incredibly lucky, just launched the early-access program last September with a few posts here and there, and Panelbear is already handling millions of page views per month for various websites. It’s been a crazy ride so far!</p><p>I'm happy to answer your questions, feel free to say hi via email at <a href="https://panelbear.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#adccc3d9c5c2c3d4edddccc3c8c1cfc8ccdf83cec2c0"><span data-cfemail="4a2b243e222524330a3a2b242f26282f2b3864292527">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> or you can DM me on twitter if you prefer: <a href="https://twitter.com/anthonynsimon">@anthonynsimon</a></p></div></div></div>]]>

      <article role="main">
        <p>This article is going to be an introduction to <strong>embedded Linux security</strong>.</p>
<p>Since this topic is quite extensive, I divided into two parts. In this first part, we will have a small introduction to security concepts and threat modeling and then focus on some mitigation techniques to improve the security of an embedded Linux device, including secure boot, code/data encryption and secure key storage.</p>
<p>If you prefer a one hour talk instead of reading this article, you can also watch the webinar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcUKAgVKSxQ">“Introduction to embedded Linux security”</a> I recorded for <a href="https://www.toradex.com/">Toradex</a>. I also gave the same talk at Embedded Linux Conference North America 2020, but as I write this article it was not yet published on YouTube.</p>
<p>Let’s first start with some concepts…</p>
<h2 id="security-concepts">Security concepts</h2>
<p>Security is all about risk mitigation.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we have <strong>owners</strong>, those who benefit from a product or service (user, manufacturer, business owner, etc). And owners want to protect <strong>assets</strong>, anything that has some value in the product or service (data, code, reputation, etc).</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have <strong>threat actors</strong>, a person or thing (malicious hacker, government, etc) that can manifest a <strong>threat</strong>, anything that is capable of acting against an asset in a manner that can result in harm.</p>
<p>To manifest a threat, the threat actor will explore <strong>vulnerabilities</strong> (weakness in the system) via an <strong>attack vector</strong>, a method or pathway used by the threat actor to access or penetrate the target system.</p>
<p>The diagram below express very well all those concepts:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/hardware-threat-landscape/at_download/fullReport"><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-security-concepts.png" alt="Security Concepts"></a></p>
<p>In the end, is a cat-and-mouse game between owners and threat actors. How far will the owner go to protect the assets? How far will the threat actor go to compromise the assets? It really depends on the value of the assets. Indeed, the perception of value may not be the same for owners and threat actors.</p>
<p>Identifying assets (and their value) to mitigate the risks of being compromised can be done in a process called <strong>threat modeling</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="threat-modeling">Threat modeling</h2>
<p>Threat modeling is a process where potential threats can be identified, enumerated, and mitigations can be prioritized. It is basically a risk assessment process where you evaluate the value of your assets and the cost to protect them. The result of a threat modeling is the <strong>threat model</strong> of your product.</p>
<p><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-threat-modeling.png" alt="Threat modeling"></p>
<p>There are several techniques and methodologies that can help during threat modeling, including STRIDE, DREAD, VAST, OCTAVE, and many others.</p>
<p>To have a very basic introduction to the topic, let’s talk about STRIDE and DREAD.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_(security)">STRIDE model</a> is a very useful tool to help classify threats. It was developed by Microsoft and the name is an acronym for the six main types of threats: <strong>S</strong>poofing, <strong>T</strong>ampering, <strong>R</strong>epudiation, <strong>I</strong>nformation disclosure, <strong>D</strong>enial of service and <strong>E</strong>scalation of privileges. STRIDE can be used to identify all threats the assets of a system could be exposed to.</p>
<p><a href="https://allabouttesting.org/stride-acronym-of-threat-modeling-system/"><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-stride.png" alt="STRIDE"></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAD_(risk_assessment_model)">DREAD methodology</a> is a tool for risk-assessing computer security threats. The name is an acronym for five categories of security threats: <strong>D</strong>amage (how bad would an attack be), <strong>R</strong>eproducibility (how easy is it to reproduce the attack), <strong>E</strong>xploitability (how much work is it to launch the attack), <strong>A</strong>ffected users (how many people would be impacted) and <strong>D</strong>iscoverability (how easy is it to discover the threat).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/SecurityInnovation/threat-modeling-to-reduce-software-security-risk"><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-dread.png" alt="DREAD"></a></p>
<p>While the STRIDE model helps to identify the threats, the DREAD methodology helps to rank them. For each threat in the system, you would go over each threat category and classify it in low (1 point), medium (2 points), or high (3 points). In the end, you would have a ranked list of threats and mitigation strategies. Example:</p>
<p><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-threat-modeling-example.png" alt="Threat modeling example"></p>
<p>We can see that threat modeling will provide a very clear view of what we want to protect, how we plan to protect it, and associated costs. This is part of the <strong>threat model</strong> of the product, which needs to be re-evaluated for every development cycle. As a result, the threat model will provide a prioritized list of threats to work on, so we can focus on implementing the mitigations to improve the security of the product.</p>
<p>How to protect the integrity and authenticity of your code? How to ensure the privacy of the data? Where to store cryptographic keys? How to minimize the risks of an application to be exploited? Let’s try to answer all of those questions and many more, starting with secure boot!</p>
<h2 id="secure-boot">Secure Boot</h2>
<p>How to make sure the code you are running was built by a trustworthy person or company? Implementing a <strong>secure boot</strong> process.</p>
<p>The objective of a secure boot process is to protect the integrity and authenticity of the code.</p>
<p>Secure boot is usually based on the verification of digital signatures. An embedded Linux system normally has three major components: bootloader, kernel and root filesystem (rootfs). All these components are signed and the signatures are checked during boot.</p>
<p>For example, some hardware mechanism can be used to check the signature of the bootloader, that will check the signature of the kernel, that will use a ramdisk image to check the signature of the root filesystem. Since we have one component checking the signature of the next one in the boot chain, this process is often called a <strong>chain-of-trust</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-secure-boot-1.png" alt="Secure boot"></p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a real example on an <a href="https://www.nxp.com/imx6">NXP iMX6</a> device.</p>
<p>Everything starts in the ROM code inside the SoC. On NXP iMX6, there is a hardware component called High Assurance Boot (HAB) that it is able to validate the signature of the first stage bootloader, making it possible to implement a secure boot process. The High Assurance Boot inside iMX6 devices can also be called the <strong>Root of Trust</strong>, since if it is compromised, all the secure boot process is also compromised.</p>
<p>The ROM code inside the iMX6 SoC, using the HAB component, will check the signature of the bootloader. For that, it is necessary to generate a pair of keys (public and private), sign the bootloader with the private key and store the public key inside the SoC. On iMX6, OTP fuses are used to store the keys. Actually, to make it less expensive, only the hash of the public key is stored in the SoC.</p>
<p>When the bootloader boots (e.g. <a href="https://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot">U-Boot</a>), it will have to check the signature of the Linux kernel. For that, it is common to use an image format called <strong>FIT image</strong>. The FIT image is a container for multiple binaries with hashing and signature support, and usually contains the Linux kernel image, device tree files and an initial ramdisk. After generating a pair of keys, we need to sign the binaries inside the FIT image with the private key e configure U-Boot to use the public key to check the signature of the FIT image.</p>
<p>After the kernel boots, it will run the <em>init</em> program from the ramdisk image. The ramdisk will have the logic to verify the integrity of the final root filesystem before mounting it. There are some options to implement this. One common option is using the device-mapper verity (<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/device-mapper/verity.html">dm-verity</a>) kernel module. The <strong>dm-verity</strong> kernel module provides integrity checking of block devices and requires a read-only rootfs (squashfs can be a good solution). Other approaches would be <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Integrity_Measurement_Architecture">IMA</a> or <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/device-mapper/dm-integrity.html">dm-integrity</a> if you want a read-write root filesystem.</p>
<p>Here is a diagram of the complete secure boot process:</p>
<p><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-secure-boot-2.png" alt="Secure boot on NXP iMX6"></p>
<p>This is only one example of a secure boot implementation, although it could be applied to a different set of boards and ARM SoCs.</p>
<p>Yet nothing is 100% secure!</p>
<p>Secure boot vulnerabilities in the ROM code of several NXP devices (i.MX6, i.MX50, i.MX53, i.MX7, i.MX28 and Vybrid families) were <a href="https://blog.quarkslab.com/vulnerabilities-in-high-assurance-boot-of-nxp-imx-microprocessors.html">publicly disclosed</a> on July 17th, 2017. And if your chain of trust is compromised, everything is compromised! So we need to be aware of these types of vulnerabilities (in this case, they were fixed with new silicon).</p>
<p>While secure boot ensures authenticity and integrity, it does not protect the device from being counterfeited or threat actors from extracting code/data from the device. So if you want to protect your intellectual property or ensure data confidentiality, you will need to use encryption.</p>
<h2 id="code-and-data-encryption">Code and data encryption</h2>
<p>You may want to encrypt data or code in an embedded Linux device.</p>
<p>Data encryption is a common approach when you need to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the users. Data is any information generated during the executing of the device, including databases, configuration files, and so on.</p>
<p>Code encryption depends on the situation, and encrypting the full root filesystem is not that common. Usually, most of the components are free and open source software, so there is nothing to hide. There is also the issue of GPLv3 and Tivoization (using any GPLv3 software will force you to provide a mechanism for the user to update the software, and that would make it more difficult if you are encrypting it). A more common use case is to encrypt only the applications you developed for the device. It’s usually where your intellectual property is.</p>
<p>There are basically two main approaches to encryption in Linux: <strong>full disk encryption</strong> and <strong>file-based encryption</strong>.</p>
<p>Full disk encryption provides encryption at the block level and the whole disk or a disk partition is encrypted. For that, we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dm-crypt">dm-crypt</a>, the Linux kernel’s device mapper crypto target.</p>
<p>File-based encryption provides encryption at the file system level, where each directory may be separately and optionally encrypted with a different key. The two most common implementations of file-based encryption are <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fscrypt">fscrypt</a> and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ECryptfs">eCryptFS</a>. fscrypt is an API available on some filesystems like EXT4, UBIFS and F2FS, and eCryptFS is a more generic solution implemented as a layer that stacks on top of an existing filesystem.</p>
<p>But what about the keys used for encryption?</p>
<h2 id="encryption-keys">Encryption keys</h2>
<p>Since an asymmetric key algorithm is too slow to be used in encryption, usually a symmetric-key algorithm is used in encryption. That means the same key is used for encryption and decryption, and the key should be available somewhere in the filesystem so the encrypted code/data can be decrypted.</p>
<p>But we can’t just leave the key lying around in the filesystem, right?</p>
<p>There are several cases where companies …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

November 7, 2020 | https://vanguard-method.net/failure-demand/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://vanguard-method.net/failure-demand/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
		<p><span>The concept of failure demand was first described by John Seddon in his book “</span><span>I Want You to Cheat”, published in 1992. It was initially called </span><span>“demand we don’t want” and later, after much careful thought, re-named “failure demand”. </span><span>Since then, it has become widely known by people who work in service organisations. But do they understand it and do they know what to do about it?</span></p>
<h4><b>What is Failure Demand?</b></h4>
<p><span>It is </span><i><span>demand caused by a failure to do something or do something right for the customer.</span></i><span> Customers come back, making further demands, unnecessarily consuming the organisation’s resources because the service they receive is ineffective.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to understand demand:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Note how it is defined in customer terms.</li>
<li><span>Imagine what service would be like if every customer got whatever they needed… Seddon sets a high bar.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Failure demand stands in contrast to value demand. The latter consists of customer requests that are a normal part of providing a service.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Failure demand" src="https://i2.wp.com/vanguard-method.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Failure-demand.png?resize=570%2C204&amp;ssl=1" alt="Failure demand" width="570" height="204" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vanguard-method.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Failure-demand.png?w=570&amp;ssl=1 570w, https://i2.wp.com/vanguard-method.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Failure-demand.png?resize=300%2C107&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vanguard-method.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Failure-demand.png?w=570&amp;ssl=1 570w, https://i2.wp.com/vanguard-method.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Failure-demand.png?resize=300%2C107&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/vanguard-method.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Failure-demand.png?resize=570%2C204&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p><span>In conventional command-and-control service organisations, failure demand routinely runs at 40 – 60% of total customer demand. In some organisations, particularly health and social care and utilities, it can be as high as 80% or more. It is astonishing burden on capacity and an astonishing cost.</span></p>
<h4><b>Failure Demand Analysis</b></h4>
<p><span>To find out how much failure demand there is you need to study: What demands, in their terms, do customers make? How many of these are caused by failure to do something or do something right?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Some tips:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Study demand as it arises, at the points where your customers transact with your organisation. Do not translate the demand into an internal definition, record exactly what the customer says/writes.</span></li>
<li><span>Classify demands in customer terms, develop a customer typology. What types of demand and with what frequency? How predictable is each type?</span></li>
<li><span>What proportions are value demand and failure demand?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Identifying failure demand is the easy task. Reducing and removing it is the more difficult part. Command-and-control thinkers assume that the problem is caused by failures of people and processes. But tinkering about with those won’t achieve much, because failure demand is systemic. To remove it, you have to change the system; to even contemplate that, a significant shift in management thinking is necessary.</span></p>
<h4><b>How to Remove Failure Demand</b></h4>
<p><span>The only solution is to redesign the organisation. To design it as a system whose purpose is to achieve each and every customer’s purpose, articulated and measured in customer terms. It means:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Rethinking all organisation controls</span></li>
<li><span>Designing services from the outside-in</span></li>
<li><span>Redefining job roles, including managerial roles</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>An overhaul of the entire organisation is required – front line services and supporting functions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Following the redesign, not only will you provide a better service and have happier customers, but you will reduce the cost of delivering the service. It is not uncommon to reduce costs by as much as 50%. The increase in capacity can now be spent in more productive ways, to drive growth.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><b>Common Mistakes</b></h4>
<p><span>As John Seddon says, “the concept of failure demand is easy to understand and easy to misunderstand”. The misunderstanding occurs when the idea is taken out of its system thinking framework and grafted on a command and control mindset.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The most common mistakes in tackling failure demand are:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Buying software to measure it and report it.<br>
</span>A complete waste of time and money. Failure demand should not be a permanent measure. It is a temporary measure that sends a clear signal of ineffectiveness. Measuring and reporting failure demand takes management’s attention in the wrong direction.</li>
<li><span>Setting targets to reduce it<br>
</span>A target is a goal without a method. Setting targets will only lead to cheating. The only target you need is to work towards perfect services, the consequence being eradication of failure demand.</li>
<li><span>Focusing on people and processes, allocating blame<br>
</span>We often see organisations – encouraged by consultants who know no better – setting up “governance” units to allocate blame to functions or processes and work across boundaries to resolve poor processes. Achieving marginal falls in failure demand hoodwinks them into believing they have the right solution. It is to fail to realise that failure demand is systemic and can only be eradicated by a change to the system.</li>
</ol>
<p><span>These kinds of initiatives will achieve modest improvements at best. The purpose is eradication.</span></p>
<p><span>Many service organisations have achieved Seddon’s high bar, where failure demand is negligible. The design of the system coheres people around a common purpose as all performance measures rise, so does morale.</span></p>

<div id="post-body-6228875266477811300">
<p>About a year ago ago, I got a new laptop: a late 2019 Razer Blade Stealth 13.&nbsp; It sports an Intel i7-1065G7 with the best Intel's Ice Lake graphics along with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650.&nbsp; Apart from needing an ACPI lid quirk and the power management issues described here, it’s been a great laptop so far and the Linux experience has been very smooth.</p><p>

Unfortunately, the out-of-the-box integrated graphics performance of my new laptop was less than stellar.&nbsp; My first task with the new laptop was to debug a rendering issue in the Linux port of Shadow of the Tomb Raider which turned out to be a bug in the game.&nbsp; In the process, I discovered that the performance of the game’s built-in benchmark was almost half of Windows.&nbsp; We’ve had some performance issues with Mesa from time to time on some games but half seemed a bit extreme.&nbsp; Looking at system-level performance data with gputop revealed that GPU clock rate was unable to get above about 60-70% of the maximum in spite of the GPU being busy the whole time.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; The GPU wasn’t able to get enough power.&nbsp; Once I sorted out my power management problems, the benchmark went from about 50-60% the speed of Windows to more like 104% the speed of windows (yes, that’s more than 100%).</p><p>

This blog post is intended to serve as a bit of a guide to understanding memory throughput and power management issues and configuring your system properly to get the most out of your Intel integrated GPU.&nbsp; Not everything in this post will affect all laptops so you may have to do some experimentation with your system to see what does and does not matter.&nbsp; I also make no claim that this post is in any way complete; there are almost certainly other configuration issues of which I'm not aware or which I've forgotten.</p><h2>
Update your drivers</h2><p>
This should go without saying but if you want the best performance out of your hardware, running the latest drivers is always recommended.&nbsp; This is especially true for hardware that has just been released.&nbsp; Generally, for graphics, most of the big performance improvements are going to be in Mesa but your Linux kernel version can matter as well.&nbsp; In the case of Intel Ice Lake processors, some of the power management features aren’t enabled until Linux 5.4.</p><p>

I’m not going to give a complete guide to updating your drivers here.&nbsp; If you’re running a distro like Arch, chances are that you’re already running something fairly close to the latest available.&nbsp; If you’re on Ubuntu, the padoka PPA provides versions of the userspace components (Mesa, X11, etc.) that are usually no more than about a week out-of-date but upgrading your kernel is more complicated.&nbsp; Other distros may have something similar but I’ll leave as an exercise to the reader.</p><p>

This doesn’t mean that you need to be obsessive about updating kernels and drivers.&nbsp; If you’re happy with the performance and stability of your system, go ahead and leave it alone.&nbsp; However, if you have brand new hardware and want to make sure you have new enough drivers, it may be worth attempting an update.&nbsp; Or, if you have the patience, you can just wait 6 months for the next distro release cycle and hope to pick up with a distro update.</p><h2>
Make sure you have dual-channel RAM</h2><p>
One of the big bottleneck points in 3D rendering applications is memory bandwidth.&nbsp; Most standard monitors run at a resolution of 1920x1080 and a refresh rate of 60 Hz.&nbsp; A 1920x1080 RGBA (32bpp) image is just shy of 8 MiB in size and, if the GPU is rendering at 60 FPS, that adds up to about 474 MiB/s of memory bandwidth to write out the image every frame.&nbsp; If you're running a 4K monitor, multiply by 4 and you get about 1.8 GiB/s.&nbsp; Those numbers are only for the final color image, assume we write every pixel of the image exactly once, and don't take into account any other memory access.&nbsp; Even in a simple 3D scene, there are other images than just the color image being written such as depth buffers or auxiliary gbuffers, each pixel typically gets written more than once depending on app over-draw, and shading typically involves reading from uniform buffers and textures.&nbsp; Modern 3D applications typically also have things such as depth pre-passes, lighting passes, and post-processing filters for depth-of-field and/or motion blur.&nbsp; The result of this is that actual memory bandwidth for rendering a 3D scene can be 10-100x the bandwidth required to simply write the color image.</p><p>

Because of the incredible amount of bandwidth required for 3D rendering, discrete GPUs use memories which are optimized for bandwidth above all else.&nbsp; These go by different names such as GDDR6 or HBM2 (current as of the writing of this post) but they all use extremely wide buses and access many bits of memory in parallel to get the highest throughput they can.&nbsp; CPU memory, on the other hand, is typically DDR4 (current as of the writing of this post) which runs on a narrower 64-bit bus and so the over-all maximum memory bandwidth is lower.&nbsp; However, as with anything in engineering, there is a trade-off being made here.&nbsp; While narrower buses have lower over-all throughput, they are much better at random access which is necessary for good CPU memory performance when crawling complex data structures and doing other normal CPU tasks.&nbsp; When 3D rendering, on the other hand, the vast majority of your memory bandwidth is consumed in reading/writing large contiguous blocks of memory and so the trade-off falls in favor of wider buses.</p><p>

With integrated graphics, the GPU uses the same DDR RAM as the CPU so it can't get as much raw memory throughput as a discrete GPU.&nbsp; Some of the memory bottlenecks can be mitigated via large caches inside the GPU but caching can only do so much.&nbsp; At the end of the day, if you're fetching 2 GiB of memory to draw a scene, you're going to blow out your caches and load most of that from main memory.</p><p>

The good news is that most motherboards support a dual-channel ram configurations where, if your DDR units are installed in identical pairs, the memory controller will split memory access between the two DDR units in the pair.&nbsp; This has similar benefits to running on a 128-bit bus but without some of the drawbacks.&nbsp; The result is about a 2x improvement in over-all memory throughput.&nbsp; While this may not affect your CPU performance significantly outside of some very special cases, it makes a huge difference to your integrated GPU which cares far more about total throughput than random access.&nbsp; If you are unsure how your computer's RAM is configured, you can run “dmidecode -t memory” and see if you have two identical devices reported in different channels.</p><h2>
Power management 101</h2><p>
Before getting into the details of how to fix power management issues, I should explain a bit about how power management works and, more importantly, how it doesn’t.&nbsp; If you don’t care to learn about power management and are just here for the system configuration tips, feel free to skip this section.</p><p>

Why is power management important?&nbsp; Because the clock rate (and therefore the speed) of your CPU or GPU is heavily dependent on how much power is available to the system.&nbsp; If it’s unable to get enough power for some reason, it will run at a lower clock rate and you’ll see that as processes taking more time or lower frame rates in the case of graphics.&nbsp; There are some things that you, as the user, cannot control such as the physical limitations of the chip or the way the OEM has configured things on your particular laptop.&nbsp; However, there are some things which you can do from a system configuration perspective which can greatly affect power management and your performance.</p><p>

First, we need to talk about thermal design power or TDP.&nbsp; There is a lot of misunderstanding on the internet about TDP and we need to clear some of them up.&nbsp; Wikipedia defines TDP as “the maximum amount of heat generated by a computer chip or component that the cooling system in a computer is designed to dissipate under any workload.”&nbsp; The Intel Product Specifications site defines TDP as follows:</p><p>

Thermal Design Power (TDP) represents the average power, in watts, the processor dissipates when operating at Base Frequency with all cores active under an Intel-defined, high-complexity workload. Refer to Datasheet for thermal solution requirements.</p><p>

In other words, the TDP value provided on the Intel spec sheet is a pretty good design target for OEMs but doesn’t provide nearly as many guarantees as one might hope.&nbsp; In particular, there are several things that the TDP value on the spec sheet is not:</p><ul>
<li>It’s not the exact maximum power.&nbsp; It’s a “average power”.</li>
<li>It may not match any particular workload.&nbsp; It’s based on “an Intel-defined, high-complexity workload”.&nbsp; Power consumption on any other workload is likely to be slightly different.</li>
<li>It’s not the actual maximum.&nbsp; It’s based on when the processor is “operating at Base Frequency with all cores active.” Technologies such as Turbo Boost can cause the CPU to operate at a higher power for short periods of time.</li>
</ul><p>
If you look at the&nbsp; Intel Product Specifications page for the i7-1065G7, you’ll see three TDP values: the nominal TDP of 15W, a configurable TDP-up value of 25W and a configurable TDP-down value of 12W.&nbsp; The nominal TDP (simply called “TDP”) is the base TDP which is enough for the CPU to run all of its cores at the base frequency which, given sufficient cooling, it can do in the steady state.&nbsp; The TDP-up and TDP-down values provide configurability that gives the OEM options when they go to make a laptop based on the i7-1065G7.&nbsp; If they’re making a performance laptop like Razer and are willing to put in enough cooling, they can configure it to 25W and get more performance.&nbsp; On the other hand, if they’re going for battery life, they can put the exact same chip in the laptop but configure it to run as low as 12W.&nbsp; They can also configure the chip to run at 12W or 15W and then ship software with the computer which will bump it to 25W once Windows boots up.&nbsp; We’ll talk more about this reconfiguration …</p></div></div></div>

      <p>Even though MP3 is probably the single most well known file format and codec on Earth, itâ€™s not very well understood by most 

programmers â€“ for many encoders/decoders is in the class of software â€œother peopleâ€� write, like standard libraries or operating system 

kernels. This article will attempt to demystify the decoder, with short top-down primers on signal processing and information theory 

when necessary. Additionally, a small but not full-featured decoder will be written (in Haskell), suited to play around with.</p>

<p>The focus on this article is on concepts and the design choices the MPEG team made when they designed the codec â€“ not on 

uninteresting implementation details or heavy theory. Some parts of a decoder are quite arcane and are better understood by reading the 

specification, a good book on signal processing, or the many papers on MP3 (see references at the end).</p>

<p>A note on the code: The decoder accompanying this article is written for readability, not speed. Additionally, some unusual features 

have been left out. The end result is a decoder that is inefficient and not standards compliant, but with hopefully readable code. You 

can grab the source here: <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/mp3decoder">mp3decoder-0.0.1.tar.gz</a>. 

Scroll down to the bottom of the article or see README for build instructions.</p>

<p>A fair warning: The author is a hobby programmer, not an authority in signal processing. If you find an error, please drop me an 

e-mail. be@bjrn.se</p>

<p>With that out of the way, we begin our journey with the ear.</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<h3>Human hearing and psychoacoustics</h3>

<p>The main idea of MP3 encoding, and lossy audio coding in general, is removing acoustically irrelevant information from an audio 

signal to reduce its size. The job of the encoder is to remove some or all information from a signal component, while at the same time 

not changing the signal in such a way audible artifacts are introduced.</p>

<p>Several properties (or â€œdeficienciesâ€�) of human hearing are used by lossy audio codecs. One basic property is we canâ€™t hear above 20 

kHz or below 20 Hz, approximately. Additionally, thereâ€™s a threshold of hearing â€“ once a signal is below a certain threshold it canâ€™t 

be heard, itâ€™s too quiet. This threshold varies with frequency; a 20 Hz tone can only be heard if itâ€™s stronger than around 60 

decibels, while frequencies in the region 1-5 kHz can easily be perceived at low volume.</p>

<p>A very important property affecting the auditory system is known as <i>masking</i>. A loud signal will â€œmaskâ€� other signals 

sufficiently close in frequency or time; meaning the loud signal modifies the threshold of hearing for spectral and temporal neighbors. 

This property is very useful: not only can the nearby masked signals be removed; the audible signal can also be compressed further as 

the noise introduced by heavy compression will be masked too.</p>

<p>This masking phenomenon happens within frequency regions known as <i>critical bands</i> â€“ a strong signal within a critical band 

will mask frequencies within the band. We can think of the ear as a set of band pass filters, where different parts of the ear pick up 

different frequency regions. An audiologist or acoustics professor have plenty to say about critical bands and the subtleties of 

masking effects, however in this article we are taking a simplified engineering approach: for our purpose itâ€™s enough to think of these 

critical bands as fixed frequency regions where masking effects occur.</p>

<p>Using the properties of the human auditory system, lossy codecs and encoders remove inaudible signals to reduce the information 

content, thus compressing the signal. The MP3 standard does not dictate how an encoder should be written (though it assumes the 

existence of critical bands), and implementers have plenty of freedom to remove content they deem imperceptible. One encoder may decide 

a particular frequency is inaudible and should be removed, while another encoder keeps the same signal. Different encoders use 

different <i>psychoacoustic models</i>, models describing how humans perceive sounds and thus what information may be removed.</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<h3>About MP3</h3>

<p>Before we begin decoding MP3, it is necessary to understand exactly what MP3 <i>is</i>. MP3 is a codec formally known as MPEG-1 

Audio Layer 3, and it is defined in the MPEG-1 standard. This standard defines three different audio codecs, where layer 1 is the 

simplest that has the worst compression ratio, and layer 3 is the most complex but has the highest compression ratio and the best audio 

quality per bit rate. Layer 3 is based on layer 2, in turn based on layer 1. All of the three codecs share similarities and have many 

encoding/decoding parts in common. </p>

<p>The rationale for this design choice made sense back when the MPEG-1 standard was first written, as the similarities between the 

three codecs would ease the job for implementers. In hindsight, building layer 3 on top of the other two layers was perhaps not the 

best idea. Many of the advanced features of MP3 are shoehorned into place, and are more complex than they would have been if the codec 

was designed from scratch. In fact, many of the features of AAC were designed to be â€œsimplerâ€� than the counterpart in MP3. </p>

<p>At a very high level, an MP3 encoder works like this: An input source, say a WAV file, is fed to the encoder. There the signal is 

split into parts (in the time domain), to be processed individually. The encoder then takes one of the short signals and transforms it 

to the frequency domain. The psychoacoustic model removes as much information as possible, based on the content and phenomena such as 

masking. The frequency samples, now with less information, are compressed in a generic lossless compression step. The samples, as well 

as parameters how the samples were compressed, are then written to disk in a binary file format.</p>

<p>The decoder works in reverse. It reads the binary file format, decompress the frequency samples, reconstructs the samples based on 

information how content was removed by the model, and then transforms them to the time domain. Letâ€™s start with the binary file 

format.</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<h3>Decoding, step 1: Making sense of the data</h3>

<p>Many computer users know that an MP3 are made up of several â€œframesâ€�, consecutive blocks of data. While important for unpacking the 

bit stream, frames are not fundamental and cannot be decoded individually. In this article, what is usually called a frame we call a 

<i>physical frame</i>, while we call a block of data that can actually be decoded a <i>logical frame</i>, or simply just a frame.</p>

<p>A logical frame has many parts: it has a 4 byte <i>header</i> easily distinguishable from other data in the bit stream, it has 17 or 

32 bytes known as <i>side information</i>, and a few hundred bytes of <i>main data</i>.</p>

<p>A physical frame has a header, an optional 2 byte checksum, side information, but only some of the main data unless in very rare 

circumstances. The screenshot below shows a physical frame as a thick black border, the frame header as 4 red bytes, and the side 

information as blue bytes (this MP3 does not have the optional checksum). The grayed out bytes is the main data that corresponds to the 

highlighted header and side information. The header for the following physical frame is also highlighted, to show the header always 

begin at offset 0.</p>

<p>The absolutely first thing we do when we decode the MP3 is to unpack the physical frames to logical frames â€“ this is a means of 

abstraction, once we have a logical frame we can forget about everything else in the bit stream. We do this by reading an offset value 

in the side information that point to the beginning of the main data.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.bjrn.se/mp3dec/logicalframe.gif"></p> 

<p>Whyâ€™s not the main data for a logical frame kept within the physical frame? At first this seems unnecessarily clumsy, but it has 

some advantages. The length of a physical frame is constant (within a byte) and solely based on the bit rate and other values stored in 

the easily found header. This makes seeking to arbitrary frames in the MP3 efficient for media players. Additionally, as frames are not 

limited to a fixed size in bits, parts of the audio signal with complex sounds can use bytes from preceding frames, in essence giving 

all MP3:s variable bit rate.</p>

<p>There are some limitations though: a frame can save its main data in several preceding frames, but not following frames â€“ this would 

make streaming difficult. Also, the main data for a frame cannot be arbitrarily large, and is limited to about 500 bytes. This is limit 

is fairly short, and is often criticized. </p>

<p>The perceptive reader may notice the gray main data bytes in the image above begin with an interesting pattern (<code>3E 50 00 

00</code>â€¦) that resembles the first bytes of the main data in the next logical frame (<code>38 40 00 00</code>â€¦). There is some 

structure in the main data, but usually this wonâ€™t be noticeable in a hex editor.</p>

<p>To work with the bit stream, we are going to use a very simple type:</p>

<pre>data MP3Bitstream = MP3Bitstream {
    bitstreamStream :: B.ByteString,
    bitstreamBuffer :: [Word8]
}</pre>

<p>Where the <code>ByteString</code> is the unparsed bit stream, and the <code>[Word8]</code> is an internal buffer used to reconstruct 

logical frames from physical frames. Not familiar with Haskell? Donâ€™t worry; all the code in this article is only complementary.</p>

<p>As the bit stream may contain data we consider garbage, such as ID3 tags, we are using a simple helper function, 

<code>mp3Seek</code>, which takes the <code>MP3Bitstream</code> and discards bytes until it finds a valid header. The new 

<code>MP3Bitstream</code> can then be passed to a function that does the actual physical to logical unpacking. </p>

<pre>mp3Seek :: MP3Bitstream -&gt; Maybe MP3Bitstream
mp3UnpackFrame :: MP3Bitstream -&gt; (MP3Bitstream, Maybe MP3LogicalFrame)</pre>

<h4>The anatomy of a logical frame</h4>

<p>When weâ€™re done decoding proper, a logical frame will have yielded us exactly 1152 time domain samples per channel. In a typical PCM 

WAV file, storing these samples would require 2304 bytes per channel â€“ …</p></div></div></div>

<section itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost"><div itemprop="text"><p>On 13 September 2020, NVIDIA announced that it will be acquiring Arm for $40 billion. Arm is powering lots of devices including most smartphones. The open licensing policy and unrivaled performance at low power applications suggested a bright future for this company. However, analysts are suggesting that this deal will be the Arm’s downfall.</p>
<p>NVIDIA and SoftBank previously announced a definitive agreement under which NVIDIA will acquire Arm Limited from SoftBank in a transaction valued at $40 billion. NVIDIA is claiming that they will collaborate with Arm and expand their R&amp;D in artificial intelligence applications. NVIDIA professes that it would retain Arm’s business model and its headquarters in Cambridge, UK.</p>
<p>The deal is said to take 18 months to complete. They have to secure regulatory approvals. UK might not approve this deal if NVIDIA’s policies don’t satisfy England’s law. There is also China, there is a high probability that China wouldn’t approve this deal due to the trade war.</p>
<p>NVIDIA is an American company which designs high performance GPUs for gaming, professional use, HPC and artificial intelligence.&nbsp; They also provide accelerators, embedded solutions and automotive solutions. Arm Ltd. on the other hand, is a semiconductor and software design company located in Cambridge, England. They design ARM processors, Mali GPUs, SoCs and software development tools. Arm has over 1000 partners and is powering 180 billion devices worldwide, and since 2016 it has been owned by SoftBank Group. Both companies are pushing the boundaries of the world’s technology with top of the line solutions.</p>
<p>Recently a few semiconductor companies, among them Samsung, were keen to buy Arm, but NVIDIA managed to win the competition and acquire Arm for a high stake of $40 billion. This deal has alerted analysts, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/chiakokhua">Mr. Chia</a>, this deal would not only damage Arm, but also the industry and the consumers as well, because NVIDIA wouldn’t be operating Arm as a totally independent company. This acquisition will grant NVIDIA control over Arm’s policies, licensing terms, fees and royalties.</p>
<p>Arm is an essential part of the industry, therefore preserving its neutrality is of great importance. NVIDIA by gaining access to Arm’s confidential information will be able to discover Arm’s future plans and deploy them ahead of the competition. Furthermore, NVIDIA will also be able to abuse Arm’s clients’ crucial information and acknowledge their future plans.</p>
<p>Eventually in a few years NVIDIA will own Arm exclusively and make its ecosystem a deep pit that traps customers, just like CUDA. If you want to know about the bad reputation of NVIDIA’s policies you should ask Linus Torvalds. He is the founder and the maintainer of Linux and has worked with big companies. In an interview back in 2012 at Aalto university, he literally showed his middle finger to NVIDIA due to NVIDIA’s atrocious behavior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“NVIDIA has been one of the worst trouble spots we’ve had with hardware manufacturers, and that is really sad because NVIDIA tries to sell chips, alot of chips, into the android market, and nvidia has been the single worst company we’ve ever dealt with, so NVIDIA f_ck you.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVpOyKCNZYw">Linus Torvalds, Aalto Talks, 14 June 2012</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>NVIDIA, by owning Arm will be able to disrupt the entire industry with a single shot, and promote its own legacy. That’s what a wise man would do for his own company, although it could be bad for the industry and us. NVIDIA will probably shift resources towards data centers and AI therefore smartphone and embedded customers would suffer.</p>

<p>This shift in the industry would probably trigger Arm’s customers. They definitely don’t want their leash in NVIDIA’s hands. Arm’s customers will probably chose a plan B to employ it when things go sideways with Arm. Analysts believe that this plan B would be RISC-V. RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA). Unlike others this ISA is provided under open source licenses and therefore doesn’t require fees. Several companies provide RISC-V hardware; Linux has support for RISC-V and RISC-V is supported in popular software development tools.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.eenewseurope.com/news/risc-v-boom-edge-ai-says-facebooks-chief-ai-scientist">Yann LeCun</a>, Facebook’s chief AI scientist and inventor of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), due to acquisition of Arm by NVIDIA, industry will move to RISC-V as it is a promising alternative to Arm’s solutions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is a change in the industry and ARM with NVIDIA makes people uneasy but the emergence of RISC-V sees chips with a RISC-V core and an NPU (neural processing unit). These are incredibly cheap, less than $10, with many out of China, and these will become ubiquitous. I’m wondering if RISC-V will take over the world there.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eenewseurope.com/news/risc-v-boom-edge-ai-says-facebooks-chief-ai-scientist">Yann LeCun, eeNews, 15 October 2020</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is also another analyst who believes RISC-V will be replacing Arm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The complete destruction of ARM ecosystem and a mass exodus for RISC-V is absolutely predictable and will happen very quickly, in the next few years. My recommendation to everyone is to study the RISC-V Instruction Set Manual as soon as possible.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Codeplay Software Limited has <a href="https://semiaccurate.com/2020/10/29/codeplay-joins-the-risc-v-foundation/">recently announced</a> that they will be joining the RISC-V foundation. Codeplay produces software tools and is a contributing member of the Multicore Association, the Khronos Group, and the HSA Foundation. Codeplay is bringing its tool to the RISC-V foundation. This move will be a huge leap forward for RISC-V and is a result of NVIDIA’s acquisition of Arm.</p>

				<p>Victorian society was famously paranoid about the dangers of masturbation. For teachers, priests and those with responsibility for young people, it was a question of morals and the corruption of youth – but the medical profession also agreed that self-abuse was a vice with terrible consequences. The old cliché that the practice ‘makes you go blind’ was not said just to frighten teenage boys – it was a view sincerely held by many physicians. Others suggested that masturbation caused <a href="http://www.thomas-morris.uk/an-unnatural-propensity-and-its-perils/">heart disease</a>, or proposed deeply unpleasant <a href="http://www.thomas-morris.uk/abominable-disgusting-habit/">treatment regimes</a> to make the problem go away.</p>
<p>Though many people will associate this fear with the nineteenth century, its roots go back a lot further – as least as early as the 1720s, when a pamphlet entitled <em>Onania; or, The heinous sin of self-pollution, and all its frightful consequences, in both sexes, considered</em> was published in London – and subsequently became a bestseller on <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/evans/N02163.0001.001/1:6?rgn=div1;view=fulltext">both sides of the Atlantic</a>.</p>
<p>This article, published in the <em>Transactions of the Physico-medical Society of New York </em>in 1817, is another striking example. It is also an interesting example of faulty diagnosis. The author was a physician from Connecticut, Dr William Tully:<a href="http://www.thomas-morris.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-by-onanism.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.thomas-morris.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-by-onanism.jpg" alt="An instance of death from onanism" width="461" height="230" srcset="http://www.thomas-morris.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-by-onanism.jpg 871w, http://www.thomas-morris.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-by-onanism-300x150.jpg 300w, http://www.thomas-morris.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-by-onanism-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px"></a></p>
<p><em>E.B., aged sixteen, of active habits, of bodily size rather less than medium, and as it respects strength of constitution less vigorous than most youths of his age, complained the 3rd of October, 1812, of indisposition.</em></p>
<p>‘Feeling ill’ is not a terribly useful description, but thankfully the doctor had a history to fall back on:</p>
<p><em>For some weeks previous to this, his friends had observed, that his countenance was becoming pale and unhealthy; that universal emaciation was stealing upon him, and that he constantly manifested unusual peevishness. His appetite during this period was not observably augmented or impaired, except for liquids. This thirst, for some time, had been uniform and considerable.</em></p>
<p>Although this set of symptoms is still quite vague, many doctors today would find one potential diagnosis immediately suggesting itself. Hint: it isn’t excessive masturbation.</p>
<p><em>As the changes, however, in the state of his health, had been from day to day hardly appreciable, and as he made no complaints of illness, little attention had been paid to these circumstances. About the 20th of September, an occasion resented, and he was observed to manifest an extraordinary relish and craving for new cider. </em></p>
<p>Today in America ‘apple cider’ (as opposed to ‘hard cider’) is a non-alcoholic beverage, but I believe that in 1812 Connecticut it would have been weakly alcoholic. Do correct me if I’m wrong.</p>
<p><em>From thenceforth, he sought every opportunity of indulging this appetite, almost without limit; and made use of stratagems to obtain the gratification of his desires, to which he had previously been a stranger. His desire for food, from this period, diminished; and though tolerably active in his customary employments, yet a rapid diminution of strength was observed.</em></p>
<p>There are good reasons for thinking this entire pattern of behaviour highly significant from a diagnostic point of view. More of that later.</p>
<p><em>About the 1st of October, an unusual secretion of urine, and an almost incessant disposition to empty the bladder, was perceived. On the 3rd, as mentioned above, he first complained of indisposition, and on the morning of the 4th, first had medical advice.</em></p>
<p>When Dr Tully visited the patient shortly afterwards, these were the symptoms he found:</p>
<p><em>Extreme emaciation, but not so much diminution of strength as to prevent walking about; complexion very pale; expression of the eyes, and whole countenance haggard and wild, though no mental derangement could be perceived; no appetite for food; great thirst; skin dry and cool; tongue dry, and covered with a reddish brown crust; pulse about 130 beats in a minute very small, and receding under slight pressure; indescribable, dull, distressing sensations about the precordia, and in the back; shortness of breath, frequent micturition, and copious discharges of urine, which was limpid and colourless. The preceding night had been passed in a very sleepless and restless manner.</em></p>
<p>And this is when Dr Tully made a discovery that, he believed, explained the whole case:</p>
<p><em>At this time, it was ascertained, that he had been in the habitual nocturnal practice of onanism for about six months, frequently repeating it five or six times in a night.</em></p>
<p>That is, admittedly, quite a lot.</p>
<p><em>On being questioned, whether he had not been sensible of the pernicious effect of this baneful practice, it was found, that for some time previous, he had experienced unpleasant and distressing sensations, as an immediate consequence of every orgasm; but so much was he under the dominion of this deadly habit, as to be unable to resist its influence, notwithstanding his conviction of its fatal consequences.</em></p>
<p>Dr Tully barely needed to hear any more.</p>
<p><em>In short, it was judged, that his whole malady was the ultimate result of this practice.</em></p>
<p><em>Its primary effects, seemed to have been derangement of the digestive organs; and the secondary ones, the symptoms above detailed.</em></p>
<p>The doctor prescribed baking soda and vinegar in the hope of ‘obtaining the exhilarating effects of disengaged carbonic acid in the stomach.’ Wine, opium and cinchona bark (containing quinine, good for fevers) were also administered, and the patient given nutritious broths. But their patient quickly deteriorated, and by 10 pm had become comatose. In the early hours of the following morning he died.</p>
<p>Dr Tully was in no doubt what had caused his patient’s death: masturbation.</p>
<p><em>The ill effects of the practice, which apparently gave rise to the preceding case, have been questioned by John Hunter, in his </em>Treatise on the Venereal<em>; but with due deference to his exalted reputation, I must say, that his argument of its universality, and the little apparent evidence against it, in my opinion, apply equally well to intemperance in the use of distilled spirits.</em></p>
<p>John Hunter was indeed sceptical of the idea that masturbation caused serious illness, writing that ‘the only true objection to this selfish enjoyment is the probability of its being repeated too frequently.’</p>
<p>While happy to admit that many of his contemporaries exaggerate the dangers, Dr Tully is adamant that the ‘sin of Onan’ has potentially fatal consequences.</p>
<p><em>That popular treatises upon it, tend rather to increase than diminish the evil, I readily admit; but as a physician, I am firmly convinced, that many a vigorous constitution, which though it does mot sink under it, yet receives such a shock by it, as is frequently followed by premature old age, and a host of infirmities.</em></p>
<p>Dr Tully ventures to suggest a refinement to the prevailing opinion on the mechanism of illness caused by masturbation:</p>
<p><em>It has been the commonly received opinion, that the part of the system first affected by Onanism, is the brain, and its production through the spina dorsi; but I have long been convinced, that the stomach is first peculiarly deranged, and these other parts in consequence. In this case, paleness, emaciation, and an unusual appetite for liquids, were the first observable symptoms. Speedily, however, further depravity of appetite, is manifest, and this of such a nature, as to be followed with a certain degree of diabetes. </em></p>
<p>And here Dr Tully stumbles agonisingly close to the likely truth of the case – though he mistakes cause for effect. Emaciation, insatiable thirst and an almost incessant need to urinate are classic symptoms of acute type 1 diabetes. So much so that a modern doctor reading the case report above would probably get no further than the first paragraph before thinking, ‘Could this be type 1 diabetes?’ It’s impossible to be certain, of course, but there is little in the rest of the case report that would cast doubt on this diagnosis.</p>
<p>One other aspect of the article struck me as interesting. In the later literature on the evils of masturbation, an archetype of the habitual masturbator emerged. This description of the ‘typical patient’ is taken from William Acton’s <em>The Functions and Disorders of the Reproductive Organs</em>, first published in 1857:</p>
<p><em>The frame is stunted and weak, the muscles undeveloped, the eye is sunken and heavy, the complexion is sallow, pasty, or covered with spots of acne, the hands are damp and cold, and the skin moist.</em></p>
<p>The echoes of Dr Tully’s 1817 case report are striking: the smaller-than-average frame, the general impression of feebleness and emaciation, the unhealthy complexion. This may not be an original observation, but I’ve not seen it made before, either: perhaps this entire archetype arose because doctors mistook diabetics for masturbators.</p>

See also this series of articles titled <a href="https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/series/unix-as-ide/">Unix as IDE</a>.</p><p>A shell utility like <code>bash</code> provides built-in commands and scripting features to easily solve and automate various tasks. External *nix commands like <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code>, <code>awk</code>, <code>sort</code>, <code>find</code>, <code>parallel</code>, etc can be combined to work with each other. Depending upon your familiarity with those tools, you can either use <code>perl</code> as a single replacement or complement them for specific use cases.</p><p>Here's some one-liners (options will be explained later):</p><ul><li><code>perl -pe 's/(?:\x27;\x27|";")(*SKIP)(*F)|;/#/g'</code> — change <code>;</code> to <code>#</code> but don't change <code>;</code> within single or double quotes</li><li><code>perl -MList::Util=uniq -e 'print uniq &lt;&gt;'</code> — retain only first copy of duplicated lines, uses built-in module <code>List::Util</code></li><li><code>perl -MRegexp::Common=net -nE 'say join "\n", //g if /$RE{net}{IPv4}/'</code> — extract only IPv4 addresses, using a third-party <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Regexp::Common">Regexp::Common</a> module</li><li>Some stackoverflow Q&amp;A that I've answered over the years with simpler <code>perl</code> solution compared to other cli tools <ul><li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42554684/shell-replace-string-with-incrementing-value">replace string with incrementing value</a></li><li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48920626/sort-rows-in-csv-file-without-header-first-column">sort rows in csv file without header &amp; first column</a></li><li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63681983/sed-reverse-matched-pattern">reverse matched pattern</a></li><li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49765879/append-zeros-to-list">append zeros to list</a></li><li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62241101/arithmetic-replacement-in-a-text-file">arithmetic replacement in a text file</a></li><li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45571828/execute-bash-command-inside-awk-and-print-command-output">reverse complement DNA sequence for a specific field</a></li></ul></li></ul><p>The selling point of <code>perl</code> over tools like <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> includes feature rich regular expression engine and standard/third-party modules. If you don't already know the syntax and idioms for <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code>, learning command line options for <code>perl</code> would be the easier option. Another advantage is that <code>perl</code> is more portable compared to GNU, BSD and Mac implementations of cli tools. The main disadvantage is that <code>perl</code> is likely to be slower for features that are supported out of the box by those tools.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_perl_oneliners/images/info.svg" alt="info"> See also <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/303044/when-to-use-grep-less-awk-sed">unix.stackexchange: when to use grep, sed, awk, perl, etc</a></p></blockquote><h2><a href="#installation-and-documentation" id="installation-and-documentation">Installation and Documentation</a></h2><p>If you are on a Unix like system, you are most likely to already have some version of Perl installed.

</code></pre><h2><a href="#filtering" id="filtering">Filtering</a></h2><p><code>perl</code> one-liners can be used for filtering lines matched by a regexp, similar to <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code>. And similar to many command line utilities, <code>perl</code> can accept input from both <code>stdin</code> and file arguments.</p><pre><code>$ # sample stdin data

what
</code></pre><p>By default, <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> will automatically loop over input content line by line (with <code>\n</code> as the line distinguishing character). The <code>-n</code> or <code>-p</code> option will enable this feature for <code>perl</code>. <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_perl_oneliners/using-modules.html#convert-one-liners-to-pretty-formatted-scripts">O module</a> section shows the code Perl runs with these options.</p><p>As seen before, the <code>-e</code> option accepts code as command line argument. Many shortcuts are available to reduce the amount of typing needed. In the above examples, a regular expression (defined by the pattern between a pair of forward slashes) has been used to filter the input. When the input string isn't specified, the test is performed against special variable <code>$_</code>, which has the contents of the current input line here (the correct term would be input <strong>record</strong>, see <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_perl_oneliners/record-separators.html#record-separators">Record separators</a> chapter). <code>$_</code> is also the default argument for many functions like <code>print</code> and <code>say</code>. To summarize:</p><ul><li><code>/REGEXP/FLAGS</code> is a shortcut for <code>$_ =~ m/REGEXP/FLAGS</code></li><li><code>!/REGEXP/FLAGS</code> is a shortcut for <code>$_ !~ m/REGEXP/FLAGS</code></li></ul><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_perl_oneliners/images/info.svg" alt="info"> See <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlop#m/PATTERN/msixpodualngc">perldoc: match</a> for help on <code>m</code> operator.

November 7, 2020 | https://wundergraph.com/blog/why_not_use_graphql | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wundergraph.com/blog/why_not_use_graphql">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I think GraphQL will change the world. There will be a future where you can query any system in the world using GraphQL. I'm building this future. So why would I argue against using GraphQL? My personal pet peeve is when the community keeps advertising benefits of GraphQL that are very generic and really have nothing to do with GraphQL. If we want to drive adoption, we should be honest and take off the rose-tinted glasses. This post is a response to "Why use GraphQL" by Kyle Schrade (<a href="https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/</a>). It’s not meant to be direct criticism. The article is just an excellent base to work with as it represents opinions I keep hearing a lot in the community. If you read the whole article, it’ll take some time, you’ll fully understand why I think Kyle’s article should be named “Why use Apollo”.</p><p>If you haven't read Kyles's article already, I think it makes most sense if you read it first: <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/</a></p><p>The author states that REST APIs come with a set of downsides and how GraphQL solves all of them:
Over-fetching
Multiple requests for multiple resources
Waterfall network requests on nested data
Each client need to know the location of each service</p><p>The first three issues could be solved by writing another REST API as a facade for a specific user interface. Take Next.JS as an example. Next lets you define APIs with a very lightweight syntax. Instead of making multiple requests from the client, you can wrap those calls into an API and make them server-side. Over and underfetching can be solved with this approach too, as you can manipulate the data before sending it back to the client. The pattern described is named "backend for frontend" (BFF). It's not limited to full stack frameworks like Next.JS. You can build a BFF for your mobile apps as well.</p><p>With the BFF pattern, the client itself doesn't have to know the location of each service. However, the developer who implements the BFF needs to understand the service landscape. Hopefully you have Open API Specifications for all your services, nicely presented in a developer portal. If that's the case, it should be easy to write a BFF.</p><p>With GraphQL, there still needs to be a developer who implements the resolvers. Implementing the resolvers is more or less the same task as building a BFF, the logic is very similar. So, what's the real difference?</p><p>The BFF is easier to implement as there's a lot more tooling available. E.g. if you use a framework like Next.JS in combination with swr hooks (stale while revalidate) you get automatic caching with Etags and cache invalidation out of the box. This reduces the amount of data sent between server and client. It's even less data than GraphQL, because you're not sending query payloads and the server responds with 304 (Not Modified) if the response is still valid. Additionally, you don't have to use a heavyweight client like Apollo. The library swr by Vercel is small and very easy to use. It comes with support for pagination, hooks, and helps to navigate back and forth very efficiently.</p><p>GraphQL has persisted queries but it comes with additional overhead to implement this. If you don't use a client like Relay, which persists Queries by default, you have to do it on your own or use some third party library to implement it. Compared to the BFF approach using e.g. Next.JS there's a lot more complexity involved in getting to the same results on the frontend. How would you implement Etags with GraphQL? How do you make your GraphQL server return 304 status codes if nothing changed? Don't you first have to turn all Queries into GET requests? If so, does your GraphQL client and server easily support this?</p><p>When it comes to user experience and ease of development, the BFF is the clear winner. Less data transfer between client and server. Easier to implement. Smaller client, less moving parts.</p><p>But there's a catch. You have to build a BFF for each individual frontend. If you have many of them this can be a lot of work. You have to maintain all the BFFs. You have to operate them. You have to secure them.</p><p>Wouldn't it be nice if you could have the benefits of both without making tradeoffs? This is exactly what WunderGraph is. A framework to build BFFs using GraphQL.</p><p>In the next paragraph, Kyle goes on with the problems involved with versioned APIs. He's absolutely right that having too many versions of an API makes it very hard to keep track of. He then concludes that in GraphQL, there's only one version of the graph and changes can be tracked in a schema registry, a paid feature of Apollo. For that reason you won’t have any problems with versioning, he says.</p><p>I have problems coming to the same conclusion. Just because GraphQL schemas don’t support versioning natively doesn’t mean the problem goes away. You get the same effect if you just don’t version your REST APIs. In fact, many experts say that you should always try to not introduce versions of an API if you don’t have to. That being said, what holds you off running two versions of your GraphQL schema? Not that I think this is a good idea but it's technically possible.</p><p>If having too many versions of your REST APIs is a problem in your organization, before throwing a new tool like GraphQL at the problem, maybe you should have a look at the organization first. What are the reasons for having so many versions? Maybe the change of a process or new team structures can help? GraphQL does absolutely nothing to solve your versioning problems. Instead I think it actually makes the situation worse.</p><p>Do you have to support mobile applications? You should be aware that shipping native apps takes time. You have to wait for app store approval and you can expect many of your users to never (or slowly) install the new version. What if you want to introduce a breaking change in this scenario without breaking a client? It's impossible. You have to introduce this change in a non-breaking way. It would be interesting to hear from Facebook how they avoided breaking clients.</p><p>Evolving your schema in the case of GraphQL would mean, you deprecate the old field and add a new one. New clients use the new field while you hope that the number of clients using the old field will get less and less. Hopefully, you have a system in place that forces your users to download a new version at some point in time. Otherwise, you might be forced to support the deprecated field indefinitely. If that's the case, the deprecation model of GraphQL doesn't help you at all.</p><p>With REST you could create a new endpoint or another version of an existing one. The problem is the same, the solution just looks a bit different.</p><p>To make it clear, if you cannot control your clients you really want some kind of versioning. If all you have is a single web application you won’t need this feature. But then again GraphQL might be overkill as well.</p><p>In this paragraph, the author states that RESTful APIs don't allow partial responses.</p><p>This is just wrong. Here's an example:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>GET /users?fields=results(gender,name)</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>What does the author actually mean? I'm pretty sure he's aware of partial responses. I guess what he's trying to say is that someone needs to implement partial responses. Actually, it looks very familiar to GraphQL as you're selecting subfields from a resource. With GraphQL we have this feature out of the box.</p><p>On the other hand, with the BFF approach, you don't need this. Just return exactly the data you need. Again, a full-stack framework like Next.JS makes it simpler to implement this, makes caching easier and gives you Etag based cache invalidation for free.</p><p>To sum this section up, GraphQL gives you exactly the data you need. Partial responses can achieve the same result. BFFs come with the additional cost of implementation and maintenance but have a better UX &amp; DX.</p><p>In this paragraph, Kyle addresses the issues of REST APIs not being strictly typed. He talks about the problems with APIs where it's not clear if you get an array of posts or something different and how query parameters complicate the situation. He also states that GraphQL, because of its strict type system, doesn't have this problem.</p><p>I think what Kyle is talking about is an organizational problem for which you need an organizational solution.</p><p>You have the kind of problems he describes, when you allow developers to deploy REST APIs without publishing Open API Specifications (OAS) or similar. With OAS all resources can be described very easily. OAS also allows you to describe OAuth2 flows and required scopes per endpoint. Additionally, you can describe the exact types and validation rules for query parameters, a feature that GraphQL is lacking.</p><p>Looking at GraphQL, there's no way to describe Authentication, Authorization and input validation. GraphQL is lacking these features because the inventors at Facebook solved this problem at a different layer. There was no need for them to add these features to GraphQL. You can add custom directives to your schema to achieve similar results like OAS but this would be a custom implementation which you have to maintain yourself.</p><p>You might be thinking that OAS doesn't guarantee the response of an API to be compliant with the specification. You would be right. But how does a GraphQL schema guarantee anything?</p><p>GraphQL introspection is the act of sending a specific GraphQL query to the server to get information about the GraphQL schema. The GraphQL server is free to answer with whatever types it wants to. If you send a Query, the server can answer with a response that doesn't adhere to the GraphQL schema from the introspection response. Take Apollo Federation as an example. You upload your schema into a schema registry and then, by error, deploy the wrong version of your GraphQL server. If you change the type of a field, the client might be confused.</p><p>When we talk about type safety in GraphQL, what we actually mean is that we trust in a GraphQL server to behave exactly as advertised by the introspection Query …</p></section></div>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>Context: Actor-based programming languages offer many essential features for developing modern distributed reactive systems. These systems exploit the actor model’s isolation property to fulfill their performance and scalability demands. Unfortunately, the reliance of the model on isolation as its most fundamental property requires programmers to express complex interaction patterns between their actors to be expressed manually in terms of complex combinations of messages sent between the isolated actors.</p>

<p>Inquiry: In the last three decades, several language design proposals have been introduced to reduce the complexity that emerges from describing said interaction and coordination of actors. We argue that none of these proposals is satisfactory in order to express the many complex interaction patterns between actors found in modern reactive distributed systems.</p>

<p>Approach:  We describe seven smart home automation scenarios (in which an actor represents every smart home appliance) to motivate the support by actor languages for five radically different types of message synchronization patterns, which are lacking in modern distributed actor-based languages. Fortunately, these five types of synchronisation patterns have been studied extensively by the Complex Event Processing (CEP) community. Our paper describes how such CEP patterns are elegantly added to an actor-based programming language.</p>

<p>Knowledge: Based on our findings, we propose an extension of the single-message matching paradigm of contemporary actor-based languages in order to support a multiple-message matching way of thinking in the same way as proposed by CEP languages. Our proposal thus enriches the actor-model by ways of declaratively describing complex message combinations to which an actor can respond.</p>

<p>Grounding: We base the problem-statement of the paper on an online poll in the home automation community that has motivated the real need for the CEP-based synchronisation operators between actors proposed in the paper. Furthermore, we implemented a DSL —— called Sparrow —— that supports said operators and we argue quantitatively (in terms of LOC and in terms of a reduction of the concerns that have to be handled by programmers) that the DSL outperforms existing approaches.</p>

<p>Importance: This work aims to provide a set of synchronization operators that help actor-based languages to handle the complex interaction required by modern reactive distributed systems. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first one to add advanced CEP synchronization operators to the —— relatively simplistic single-message based matching —— mechanisms of most actor-based languages.</p>

                    <h4>Linux / Unix tools in a modern age</h4>

                        </h5>
                    </p>  
                </div><div>
                    <div itemprop="articleBody"><p>30 years ago software development was very low-level and systems administration was just computer para-scientists.
Today with so much high-level technology, many back-end or front-end programmers see the need to learn to use classic UNIX tools such as ps, grep, cat, pkill, and many others but also languages like Go, Rust, Python, and Javascript have been very successful in creating command-line tools with a higher user experience than the old ones.
In this way, many programmers choose these new tools much more comfortable, colorful, and in some cases even with better performance.</p>
<p>Here are several tools that help programmer productivity, study routines, write clean code, and even write less and do more:</p>
<p>It has been 47 years since the first release of <code>ps</code> (process status) a command-line tool to monitor processes in the operating system, widely used since then, and has not ceased to be important for any programmer and systems administrator.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.turtle-techies.com/useful-linux-unix-tools-to-add-to-your-toolbox/image01.png" alt="ps aux"></p><p>Another very important command-line tool is <code>pgrep</code> to which we give a regular expression as an argument and it returns a list of process identifiers that can be very useful if we want to stop a process or monitor it.</p>
<p>Many of these tools are a little complex to use and in our modern age, a couple of alternatives have begun to appear to improve the developer experience.</p>
<h2 id="htop">Htop <a href="#htop"><svg height="22px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="22px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a></h2><p>In 2006 Htop was created, a system to debug, monitor, and visualize processes in real-time.
It is a user interface where you can run commands like ps, pgrep, pkill without the need to directly type the commands.</p>

<p>In our modern times with the arrival of CLI’s created in languages ​​like Python, Go, Ruby, and Javascript, we can see how more interactive command-line tools have been created that provide a very comfortable user experience.</p>
<h2 id="the-arrival-of-bpytop">The arrival of BpyTOP <a href="#the-arrival-of-bpytop"><svg height="22px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="22px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a></h2><p>This 

<a href="https://github.com/aristocratos/bpytop" target="_blank">repository</a> on github hosts what could be said to be a modern child of htop.</p>
<p>The installation is technically easy, basically, we only need python 3.</p>
<p>A detailed installation guide is in the 

<a href="https://github.com/aristocratos/bpytop" target="_blank">repository</a>, but basically, it is a pip command to install the package.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">
pip3 install bpytop --upgrade

bpytop

</code></pre></div>
<p>BpyTop has a comfortable user interface to help developers find and manage the process.
The interface is a new level of intuition which can help newbie developers to don’t lose their mind and be proactive.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-bpytop-goaccess">Beyond BpyTop: GoAccess <a href="#beyond-bpytop-goaccess"><svg height="22px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="22px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a></h2><p>This is another tool to manage system process with a big difference, can run into the browser.<br>
Yes, 

<a href="https://github.com/allinurl/goaccess" target="_blank">GoAccess</a> create a web server with a dashboard to check process.</p>

<p>This is perfect for virtual machines that have high computing tasks to evaluate the state of the machine and the memory use of the process.
As it is written entirely in C, its installation is very easy.
You can provide log files from Apache, Nginx, Amazon S3, Elastic Load Balancing, CloudFront, or many others to create metrics and statistics.
Can be installed using apt but is recommended using the source code to get a more updated version.
Link of installation documentation here.
Can be dockerized to use easily in Kubernetes or other container orchestrators.</p>
<h2 id="knowledge-lack">Knowledge Lack <a href="#knowledge-lack"><svg height="22px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="22px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a></h2><p>Currently, there are many different tools and every day new frameworks, cli, libraries, programming languages, ​​and more software are created that we must study to be up to date.
This inevitably means that our brain needs to collect more and more information and we will not always be able to retain everything without forgetting other things.</p>
<p>That is why kb was created.</p>
<p>kb is a command line to create and read code fragments and short notes that explain the code, in this way a person can keep in kb his collection of knowledge about some technology that he needs to master like the serverless cli, aws cli, GCP cli, firebase cli, python, ruby, or even Linux / UNIX commands like the aforementioned pgrep, pkill, ps.</p>
<p>The user can create categories like ‘servers‘, ‘tools‘, ‘languages‘, ‘frameworks‘ to create an order and hierarchy of their knowledge.</p>
<p>The 

<a href="https://github.com/gnebbia/kb#installation" target="_blank">installation</a> is very easy, as the 

<a href="https://github.com/gnebbia/kb" target="_blank">github repository</a> states.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sh" target="_blank">Github</a>, this open-source project has a vast database of cheat sheets from different areas such as cloud computing, programming languages, ​​and UNIX / Linux commands.</p>
<p>The best thing is that it does not need an installation, since its database is in the cloud and you can access any cheat sheet using an HTTP client like cURL.</p>
<p>This will give us a small cheatsheet about lambdas functions in python.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">
curl cht.sh/python/lambda

</code></pre></div><p><img src="https://www.turtle-techies.com/useful-linux-unix-tools-to-add-to-your-toolbox/image06.png" alt="cheat.sh">
</p>
<p>The list of cheat sheets is so extensive that we can confidently use cURL and launch a couple of requests to the server that will work perfectly and give us important information on what we are looking for.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>curl cht.sh/javascript/async</code></li>
<li><code>curl cht.sh / javascript / ajax</code></li>
<li><code>curl cht.sh/javascript/json</code></li>
<li><code>curl cht.sh/javascript/loop</code></li>
<li><code>curl cht.sh/javascript/class</code></li>
<li><code>curl cht.sh/python/rest</code></li>
<li><code>curl cht.sh/nginx/proxy</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Another cheatsheets manager is 

<a href="https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr" target="_blank">tldr</a> with perfect support for Windows, Linux, and macOS because the source code is written in Javascript using Node JS.
To install yo need Node JS and run this command</p>

<p>This command has helped us for decades to know what a file contains.
But cat falls short of displaying a colored syntax for each different programming language or file format.</p>
<p>Faced with this need we introduce 

<a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat" target="_blank">bat</a>, written in Rust, a powerful language.</p>
<p>With an identity interface to cat it provides us with a more comfortable view of the file we are reviewing, it looks more like a text editor than a command line, which increases the user experience and allows better observation of the content of the file.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso" target="_blank">Espanso</a> is a multiplatform text expander, this means that before you finish writing a word it guesses the word and writes the rest for you.
This helps you write less and increase productivity when you are coding or writing documents.</p>

<p>The installation is 

<a href="https://espanso.org/install/" target="_blank">here</a> available for Windows, Linux, and macOS.</p>
<p>In few words, this tool keeps in memory your navigation history and uses a ranking algorithm to help you to go back to a place just written the first letters of the directory.</p>
<p>So if you navigate to <code>/etc</code> <code>/nginx/sites-available</code> and then you go to <code>/home/documents/</code> but you want to move back to the first place you just need write  <code>z et</code> and the algorithm can know which <code>/etc/</code> match more than <code>/home/documents/</code> and they going to move you to that directory.
Now you can write less and be more intuitive.</p>

Those can make us feel like we have little superpowers to be more productive and write less on the keyboard.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, every day we must let the machines help us do our work.</p>

<p>The following are my initial thoughts on the hardware, and on using it for light weight development.</p>

<p>TL;DR: I like it :)</p>

<h2 id="tech-specs">Tech Specs</h2>

<p>The Raspberry Pi 400 is, essentially, a Raspberry Pi 4 housed within a keyboard. You can read much better descriptions elseewhere, but the main points from the tech specs are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Broadcom BCM2711 quad-core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.8GHz</li>
  <li>4GB LPDDR4-3200</li>
  <li>Dual-band (2.4GHz and 5.0GHz) IEEE 802.11b/g/n/ac wireless LAN</li>
  <li>Bluetooth 5.0, BLE</li>
  <li>Gigabit Ethernet</li>
  <li>2 × USB 3.0</li>
  <li>1 × USB 2.0 ports</li>
  <li>Horizontal 40-pin GPIO header</li>
  <li>2 × micro HDMI ports (supports up to 4Kp60)</li>
  <li>MicroSD card slot for operating system and data storage</li>
  <li>79-key compact keyboard</li>
</ul>

<p>(full specs can be found <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/specifications/">here</a>)</p>

<p>The 400 comes with a 16GB SD card pre-installed with Raspbian, and a host of apps (LibreOffice), dev tools (Geany, Mathematica, Scratch), utilities (Chromium, VLC Media Player), and games (Minecraft).</p>

<h2 id="first-impressions-on-the-hardware">First Impressions on the Hardware</h2>

<p>It was <em>very</em> easy to plug the 400 in and get it up and running. It’s a neat device, with a good collection of ports and connectors at the back. The keyboard is…ok. The device is £67 in the UK. I bought the kit (which includes a mouse, power supply, HDMI cable, and official guide) for £94. Given the price point the keyboard is absolutely fine, but it does feel a tiny bit “plasticy”.</p>

<p>The 400 doesn’t have an audio-out. Audio is delivered via the HDMI output. For me, that’s a problem because my monitor doesn’t have speakers. It’s not a BIG problem, but it’s something I hadn’t considered.</p>

<p>The other thing the 400 doesn’t have is the connector for the Raspberry Pi camera module. Again, this isn’t a big deal for me but if you were expecting to build any camera projects then the 400 isn’t the right choice.</p>

<p>The 400has the GPIO header at the back, so with a ribbon cable you can build electronics projects very easily. I have an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2028">Adafruit T-Cobbler Plus</a> which makes it very easy to connect the 400 to a breadboard and build…stuff!</p>

<p><img src="https://martinpeck.com/images/rpi400/gpio.jpg" alt="GPIO"></p>

<p>The 400 starts up quickly, and is very capable as a general purpose desktop device. I’ve spent most of today browsing the web on it, while also installing apps, running docker containers, and building code, and it’s felt fast/snappy pretty much most of the time.</p>

<p>Overall, the hardware is pretty good and I love the form factor. I can see schools/code clubs purchasing these devices and using the in their computing labs.</p>

<h2 id="developer-experience">Developer Experience</h2>

<p>I’ve spent the day setting my Raspberry Pi 400 up, and I’m pretty impressed. My setup has included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set up Chromium, and installed the <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password extension</a></li>
  <li>Installed <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> using <a href="https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-visual-studio-code/">these instructions</a></li>
  <li>Installed the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers">VS Code Remote Containers extension</a> so that I can use Docker dev containers to develop code within</li>
</ul>

<p>On the whole, this setup was easy. So easy it was almost boring! I had a couple of issues, but on the whole it was very easy to set my Raspberry Pi 400 up so that I can write code, use Docker, and push changes to GitHub. For example, I’m currently writing this blog post within VS Code, building it using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> within a Docker container.</p>

<p>The only issue that I hit is the ARM support for various Docker images. The default Ruby dev container image wouldn’t build because it had some dependencies that didn’t have ARM variants. In the end I took the Ruby 2.7 docker image as a base, and copy/pasted into my own <code>Dockerfile</code> the parts of the defintion I needed (removing Node, Zsh, Oh my Zsh and a few other things). I’m not sure exactly what it was that was failng to build, so I need to go back and work it out, but it’s worth remembering that if the Rasberry Pi is ARM based, and not all development tools have ARM builds.</p>

<p>Having installed tools, and played around, I’ve built some very basic Rust code (with build times comparible to my MacBook!), I’ve written some <a href="https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">GPIOZero</a> based Python 3 code (controlling butons and LEDs), and I’ve set up a Jekyll/Ruby dev container and built/updated my blog.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I own several Raspberry Pi computers (1, 2 and 3). Most of them are the Model B format, but I have couple of Zeros too. All of them sit in a box, unused. I’ve played with them, then put them away. Part of that is because the performance hasn’t been that great, but the form factor is a major factor. It feels like the Raspberry Pi 400 has the power I need (for casual projects), and comes in a form factor that I can happily leave plugged in on my desk.</p>

<p>On top of that…it gives me a massive nostalgia rush using it!</p>

<p><img src="https://martinpeck.com/images/rpi400/desktop.jpg" alt="GPIO"></p>

<p>In the picture below I have two instances of VS Code (both running dev containers), plus I’m browsing. It takes it all in its stride.</p>

<p><img src="https://martinpeck.com/images/rpi400/pi-400-desktop.png" alt="GPIO"></p>

<p>I’ve not tried building anything huge…but that’s not what it’s for. It’s for having fun…</p>

<p>…and I’m <strong>absolutely having fun</strong>!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>by Marc Scholten, 29.10.2020</em></p>

<p>
There’s been a recent blog post <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/10/haskell-bad-parts-1" target="_blank"><q>Haskell: The Bad Parts</q></a> in the haskell community. To keep things in balance and to spread some positive vibes we should also talk about the good parts of the haskell programming language and it’s ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the best parts we encountered while using Haskell at digitally induced. We focus on the advantages in the web dev space because that is what we are currently working on.
</p>

<h2>Type Safety</h2>
<p>
Haskell has one of the most impressive type systems of any programming language in practical use. If you have used TypeScript or other type safe languages in the past, you should be aware of the great advantages of having a type-checked codebase. Now think TypeScript - but 10x better. That’s how Haskell feels like.
</p>

<p>
You save a lot of time debugging runtime errors. Once the compiler approved your code, you can be pretty sure that it is working. This kind of development process is usually a lot more fun than debugging why something is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>.
</p>

<p>
Once your system has hit a certain size and when new feature requests are rolling in you will want to make changes and refactor some parts of your code base. With Haskell you feel empowered to make changes to any part of your codebase.
</p>

<p>
Compare this to the ruby ecosystem: When working with rails you usually need to have lots of tests or otherwise you cannot confidently refactor code after things are running in production. And even then things will break. With the power of the type safety provided by Haskell, we can make refactorings whenever we want.
</p>

<p>
It’s really a blessing.
</p>

<h2>Managed Side Effects</h2>
<p>The way you deal with the file system, external APIs and user input is way different in Haskell than in other less functional programming languages. Your program consists of a main routine that handles the side effects and calls all your pure functions that do the real business logic.</p>

<p>
Systems build this way scale really well because there are less moving parts. Additionally pure functions can be easily tested and changed later on.
</p>

<p>
Most other languages encourage you to do side effects in an unrestricted way. For example when working in Java, a call to an object method might indirectly change the state of many related objects. This means you cannot easily reason about what a method calls does. In Haskell most functions are pure and thus don't trigger side effects like this. And when they do you can see this already by the function's type signature.
</p>

<p>
Haskell forces you to manage your side effects in a more careful way. You can still do IO and have mutable state, you just need to make this explicit inside the type signature. This leads to a far more robust system in overall.
</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>
Out of the box the performance of Haskell based web applications is great. It just feels faster than your typical Rails or PHP application. Thanks to it’s highly optimized runtime system it can also <a href="https://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2011/03/preliminary-warp-cross-language-benchmarks" target="_blank">handle way more requests than a nodejs application</a>.
</p>

<p>
And you get all that without ever thinking about performance at all. 
</p>

<h2>Tooling</h2>
<p>In 2020 it’s finally good. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server" target="_blank">Haskell Language Server</a> there’s now an easy way to have type information, documentation on hover and smart refactorings inside your text editor.</p>

<p>
With nix, cabal and stack we have the best tools for managing Haskell dependencies. Cabal hell is a thing of the past.
</p>

<p>
Great things are also happening to the Haskell compiler itself. <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/282" target="_blank">We soon can write dot expressions as you know from most other programming languages:</a> <code>project.name</code> instead of <code>name project</code>.
</p>

<h2>Hiring Haskell Developers</h2>
<p>
Haskell is a secret super power in that regard. The Haskell community consists of many very smart and talented software engineers. Haskell developers usually learn about Haskell because they care about their craft and about building high quality software products instead of learning about it to get a high paying job. Exactly the kind of people you want in your team.
</p>

<h2>2020 Haskell is Ready for Prime Time</h2>
<p>
For years there has been this trend of growing use of type safety as well as the growing use of functional programming techniques. What language could fill this space better than Haskell. Haskell has really matured in the last years and in 2020 it feels like it’s finally ready to conquer the world.

                    <p>Wars can be fought in the real world but there is also a virtual battlefield - and it is just as harmful. The <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-cotton-blackburn-introduce-balanced-solution-to-bolster-national-security-end-use-of-warrant-proof-encryption-that-shields-criminal-activity">Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act</a> is the latest attempt to access people's encrypted data and it serves as another reinforcement.</p><blockquote>This type of “warrant-proof” encryption adds little to the security of the communications of the ordinary user, but it is a serious benefit for those who use the internet for illicit purposes.</blockquote><p>This statement is plainly false. Encryption has as much benefit, if not more, for ordinary users. Encryption is used in every website that has the padlock sign (HTTP<strong>S</strong>), in every iPhone app since 2016, in every Android app since 2018 and in almost every modern application - and for good reason. Encryption helps protect sensitive information (such as that shared with your bank, or any time you use a password on a website). It may also help protect files which are not in use (at rest), or in the event the server is accessed by an unauthorised person (such as a criminal attempting to siphon off important data).</p><p>In 2016, Bruce Schneier wrote an article on <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2016/04/the_value_of_encrypt.html">the value of encryption</a> clearly outlining why encryption is needed. Schneier went on to say that when the US Government was <a href="https://blog.privacytools.io/us-government-wages-war-on-encryption/">previously</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars">fighting cryptography</a>, he wondered if they were aware how much they relied on it themselves. No-one is above the law, so if you ban strong encryption, the FBI should not use it either. Attorney General Barr, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/07/23/us_encryption_backdoor/">gives the impression</a> that the government, along with certain large companies, should have an exception to the law. Barr recognises that there are some things that are secret, but he doesn't recognise that regular citizens might also want to enjoy privacy as well.</p><blockquote>“We are not talking about protecting the nation’s nuclear launch codes,” Barr told the International Conference on Cyber Security at Fordham University.</blockquote><blockquote>“Nor are we necessarily talking about the customized encryption used by large business enterprises to protect their operations. We are talking about consumer products and services such as messaging, smart phones, email, and voice and data applications."</blockquote><p>Somehow, because your average Joe does not have government level secrets, he is no longer entitled to encryption. We are all humans, and we all need privacy. By taking away encryption, you are taking away privacy online.</p><p>This act is aimed at Section 230, which ensures that no interactive computer service provider shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of content published by their users - an essential part of the survival of all search engines, social media platforms and video sharing sites. Without it, the internet would become a self-censored platform – one that is more concerned with fending off lawsuits than providing a medium for ideas and innovation as it originally was.</p><p>It is easy to sympathise with an act that is being pushed through on the grounds that terrorists, paedophiles and drug-dealers all use encryption. Reading the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/28/us/child-sex-abuse.html">New York Times</a>' <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/podcasts/the-daily/child-sex-abuse.html">reporting</a> on online images of &nbsp;sexual abuse would leave some wondering why this sort of Act has not been passed already. Equally, if no-one had encryption then it would certainly be easier to catch above mentioned crooks and fellons.</p><p>Encryption, however, did not create these problems; these crimes were around long before it came into existence. In addition, those who partake in illicit activity will always find loopholes and ways to do so, such as using products or encryption tools that don't have backdoors. Criminals do not obey laws by definition. Furthermore, many innocent people use similar encryption to these criminals, but only to protect privacy, not hide any illegalities and yet they could still be subject to some kind of prosecution. It is assumed the use or possession of non-backdoored software would also become an offence if too many people used that instead. Statistically, it's agreed there are many more innocent people in society than criminals; those innocent people would be punished as a result of the bad actions of a few.</p><p>It is not feasible for a government to make a law of this sort that can apply outside of it's own country. Governments around the world would almost certainly disagree on which countries should be allowed access to the backdoor. As a result, this backdoor would most certainly lead to every unauthorised party having access, as the key to decrypt the data would be discovered by third parties, this would result in completely broken encryption for all. In federated networks, such as Matrix, it's not even possible to add a backdoor to every homeserver. Federation decentralises trust, which means that the person deploying the server isn't necessarily the same entity who makes the client software or server software. Matrix has even written a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors">thorough article</a> on how to combat this sort of abuse without backdoors. </p><p>Weakening encryption will only result in criminals using strong encryption anyway, without fighting any of the problems that the the law claims to solve. There is no easy solution, and it is down to politicians to provide one. Yes, encryption can be used by people with bad intentions, but it is also used by so many ordinary people who would never think to use it in a malicious way. Nearly every tool in life can be used for nefarious purposes, but does not mean it should be unavailable for legitimate non-criminal uses. You could hit someone with a hammer, but it doesn't mean hammers should be made out of foam, because if they were, people would just use knives instead. Weakening encryption will not solve these issues, and that's probably because they were not the the focus of the Act. Instead, it seems that this law seeks to criminalises strong encryption that does not have backdoors, even though the government knows full well that this will not stop criminals. The US Government should stop devising new ways to breach its citizens privacy, and focus on combating the issues that this Act fails to.</p><p>In 1988, Timothy May <a href="https://activism.net/cypherpunk/crypto-anarchy.html">predicted</a> that “the State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of [encryption], citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration”. He was spot on.</p><p><em>Cover artwork by <a href="https://setofprinciples.com/">Zan</a></em></p>

<p>Written below are some opinions and rationalizations for them. I have come to these opinions by interviewing and working with people for years. However strongly I feel about them, they can still be wrong. If you have feedback for these, please do contact me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/channikhabra/">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/channikhabra">Twitter</a>. All kind of feedback is very much appreciated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From “Functional programmer” I mean a programmer familiar with concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a>.</p>
<p>A good teammate is someone:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Who takes care of themselves</strong>. They invest in themselves. They care about their software as a craft, as something more than just cramming a whole bunch of frameworks and libraries.</li>
<li><strong>Who take care of their teammates</strong>.
<ul>
<li>They help their teammates grow, by mentoring and/or by serving as an example</li>
<li>They are empathetic towards other developers. This is most visible in kind of code a person writes. An empathetic developer writes code for other people.
<ul>
<li>They give preference to readability of code over micro-optimizations that make them feel clever</li>
<li>They write modular code with independent modules each of which do one thing well. And are easily composed to build more complex functionality.</li>
<li>They write clean, predictable and intuitive APIs</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>FP is steadily gaining popularity, but it is still not popular enough to breach the talent pool I get to interview from. Familiarity with FP is a very good indication that the person invest in themselves. And they do that in a manner which goes beyond just increasing the number of “frameworks” they have built a Todo App in.</p>
<p>Developer empathy is surprisingly rare. In almost a decade of writing code, I have met so few developers who really give a fuck that someone else will also read their abomination. Most software is written in vacuum. Familiarity with FP don’t fix that magically.</p>
<p>However there is another factor at play here. Ironically, as a side-effect of FP, code written in a functional manner is often a lot more readable than its imperative and OOP equivalents (Impromptu quiz: What’s so ironic about this statement?). Not only is functional code itself naturally declarative, an FP person is more likely to wtf when they see unreadable code in PR reviews.</p>
<p>Basic principles of FP also make for great advice for inexperienced developers. Good software architecture is hard to learn, it is a lot harder to teach. You need a mind capable of holding large amounts of complex code before the fancy design patterns even start making sense. In comparison, “pure functions + composition” and you are good to go. That is it. That is all you need to know to get started with writing modular, testable, simple code; which is easy to write and easier to maintain. As a mere side effect of avoiding side effects, you write naturally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID</a> (in spirit) code.</p>
<p>FP is not a silver bullet, but looking for functional programmers skew the universe in your favor a little. You are a lot more likely to get good people among functional programmers.</p>

<p>This post is a rather unusual story of a vulnerability that could be leveraged as a supply chain attack and used to attack millions of software developers around the world. It is also a tale of a bug collision that paid a bounty to one reporter and assigned the CVE to another!</p>
<p>The main focus of this blog post is GitHub Desktop. Other Git clients such as GitKraken, Git-Tower and SourceTree were also found to be vulnerable, however these have different exploitation scenarios that require user interaction.</p>
<h4 id="briefdescriptionoftheissue">Brief description of the issue</h4>
<p>As part of GitHub Desktop's default repository cloning process, among other actions it calls the executable git-lfs.</p>
<p>From git-lfs's official page "Git Large File Storage (LFS) replaces large files such as audio samples, videos, datasets, and graphics with text pointers inside Git, while storing the file contents on a remote server like GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise."</p>
<p>git-lfs is then called on the current cloned repository, already present in disk.</p>
<p>A vulnerability was discovered when cloning a repository with a especially crafted file in the root directory. Upon cloning such malicious repository, code execution is achieved with the same privileges as the affected user running GitHub Desktop.</p>
<p>When inspecting the desktop application under Proccess Monitor, it was noticed several actions of git-lfs called a git executable from inside the newly cloned repository.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.blazeinfosec.com/content/images/2020/11/procmon.PNG" alt="procmon"></p>
<p>By placing a malicious git in the root of the malicious repo, a user that clones it will have the malicious git executed by git-lfs, all of this behind the scenes and transparent to the user.</p>
<p>The cloning process happens normally and there is no visual indication that a malicious binary was ran instead of the original git executable.</p>
<h4 id="rootcauseanalysis">Root cause analysis</h4>
<p>We attempted to understand the root cause of this vulnerability by reading git-lfs's code. The authors of this write-up tried to put together as much information as possible in order to understand the cause of the problem.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/commands/command_clone.go">https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/commands/command_clone.go</a></p>
<p>From line 23:</p>
<pre><code>func cloneCommand(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
	requireGitVersion()

	if git.IsGitVersionAtLeast("2.15.0") {
		msg := []string{
			"WARNING: 'git lfs clone' is deprecated and will not be updated",
			"          with new flags from 'git clone'",
			"",
			"'git clone' has been updated in upstream Git to have comparable",
			"speeds to 'git lfs clone'.",
		}

		fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, strings.Join(msg, "\n"))
	}
</code></pre>
<p>The function above seems to be called when a clone action takes place. Right in the beginning the function calls requireGitVersion() and then checks whether the version is at least 2.15.0.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/commands/commands.go">https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/commands/commands.go</a></p>
<p>Line 537:</p>
<pre><code>func requireGitVersion() {
	minimumGit := "1.8.2"

	if !git.IsGitVersionAtLeast(minimumGit) {
		gitver, err := git.Version()
		if err != nil {
			Exit("Error getting git version: %s", err)
		}
		Exit("git version &gt;= %s is required for Git LFS, your version: %s", minimumGit, gitver)
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>It calls !git.IsGitVersionAtLeast(minimumGit) which can be found in <a href="https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/git/version.go">https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/git/version.go</a></p>
<p>From line 28:</p>
<pre><code>func IsGitVersionAtLeast(ver string) bool {
	gitver, err := Version()
	if err != nil {
		tracerx.Printf("Error getting git version: %v", err)
		return false
	}
	return IsVersionAtLeast(gitver, ver)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Version() can be found in the same file version.go on line 18:</p>
<pre><code>func Version() (string, error) {
	gitVersionOnce.Do(func() {
		gitVersion, gitVersionErr =
			subprocess.SimpleExec("git", "version")
	})
	return gitVersion, gitVersionErr
}
</code></pre>
<p>The function calling chain is the following:<br>
cloneCommand() -&gt; requireGitVersion() -&gt; IsGitVersionAtLeast() -&gt; Version()</p>
<p>We can see that in line 21 in version.go, there is inside the function Version() a call to subprocess.SimpleExec() - it executes the git binary with the argument "version".</p>
<p>There is an implicit assumption from git-lfs that by executing an external binary, the operating system will first look it up from the system's PATH environment variable. This is the true root cause of the vulnerability.</p>
<p>Calling the subprocess 'git' works as intended in GitHub Desktop for MacOS. In Windows, however, the search order favors the current directory first and only then it searches in the order specified in PATH.</p>
<h4 id="exploitation">Exploitation</h4>
<p>By copying calc.exe, renaming it to git.exe and committing/pushing it into the root of the repository, the attacker sets up the crafted repository that will be used to later exploit users.</p>
<p>When a developer clones this repository using GitHub Desktop for Windows, its subcomponent git-lfs will work on the cloned folder as its current directory, meaning all subsequent calls to the binary 'git' will be instead calling the malicious git.exe not the one present in the PATH.</p>

<p>The vulnerability was simultaneously discovered and researched by <a href="https://twitter.com/Rapt00rVF">Vitor Fernandes</a> and Julio Fort of Blaze Information Security. The independent researcher Dawid Golunski (dobra robota, amigo!) apparently discovered the issue a few days earlier and submitted it to MITRE, while Vitor submitted it to GitHub's bug bounty.</p>
<p>Vitor collected the bounty from GitHub's program on HackerOne as his report arrived earlier and Dawid was assigned the CVE.</p>

<section>
	<h2>WorldWideWeb</h2>
	<div>
		<p>The idea of hypertext preceded the World Wide Web by decades. But nearly all hypertext systems worked on local files. Tim Berners-Lee wanted to create a system that would work across networks so that people could link from a file on one machine to another file on another machine.</p>
		<p>WorldWideWeb wasn't just a programme for browsing files. It was a browser and editor. The introductory text reads:</p>
		<blockquote>HyperMedia Browser/Editor, An excercise in global information availability by Tim Berners-Lee</blockquote>
		<p>Today it's hard to imagine that web browsers might also be used to create web pages. It turned out that people were quite happy to write HTML by hand—something that Tim Berners-Lee and colleagues never expected. They thought that some kind of user interface would be needed for making web pages and links. That's what the WorldWideWeb browser provided. You could open a document in one window and "mark" it. Then, in a document in another window, you could create a link to the marked page.</p>
		<p>You'll notice as you use the WorldWideWeb browser that you need to double-click links to open them. That's because a single click was used for editing.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Browsing</h2>
	<div>
		<p>The user interface of the WorldWideWeb browser somewhat blurred the lines between documents on your own computer and documents out on the network. To "browse" directly to a document out on the network, you need to know its URL. But you can't simply type that URL into an address bar; there is no address bar. Instead you have to follow a sequence of steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>From the "WorldWideWeb" menu, select "Document".</li>
			<li>Now from the newly-opened "Document" menu, select "Open from full document reference".</li>
			<li>Type the URL into the field marked "reference".</li>
			<li>Press the "Open" button</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Once you've got a web-based document (or web page, as we would say today) open in WorldWideWeb, you can navigate by double-clicking on links. Every link you double-click will open in a new window.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Linking</h2>
	<div>
		<p>At its heart, WorldWideWeb is a word processor …but with links. And just as you <em>can</em> use a word processor purely for reading documents, the real fun comes when you write your own. Especially when you throw hyperlinks into the mix.</p>
		<p>To create a document:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>From the "WorldWideWeb" menu, select "New File..."</li>
			<li>Type the name of the file you want to create e.g. example.html</li>
			<li>In the boilerplate document, click on the heading to edit. Same with the text.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Once you've got a document written, it's time to turn from regular text into <em>hyper</em>text:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>From the "WorldWideWeb" menu, select "Links"</li>
			<li>To link to another document, you need to have that other document open in another window. Click on its title bar to focus it.</li>
			<li>With that document in focus, select "Mark all" from the "Links" menu.</li>
			<li>Now switch back to your example.html document and highlight the text you want to be a link.</li>
			<li>From the "Links" menu, select "Link to marked".</li>
		</ol>
		<p>You can even save your new document on to your hard drive. Click on "Save a copy offline" under the "Documents" menu.</p>
		<p>Once you've downloaded the file to your computer, you can open it up with a text editor to see what the HTML would have looked like.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Editing</h2>
<div>
	<p>To edit any document, whether it's one you created, or a page on the world wide web:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Click on the text you want edit.</li>
		<li>Edit it.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>That's it.</p>
	<p>If you want to keep a copy of the edited document, choose "Save a copy offline" from the "Documents" menu.</p>
	</div>

		<p>Dear new developer,</p>
<p>Work on your network. It will help you in numerous ways as you progress in your career. Whatever you are looking for: a new job, to hire someone, to get a mentor, to learn about a new technology, having a list of people that you know and/or have worked with that you can reach out to will help you accomplish your goals.</p>
<p>But it can be tough, especially if you are awkward around people. I am awkward around people and learned how to be less awkward. My main technique is to both give and ask for a “hook” in any conversation I start.</p>
<p>Here’s a typical “networking” conversation of which I’ve had many:</p>
<p>Dan: Hi, I’m Dan.</p>
<p>Jan: Hi, I’m Jan.</p>
<p>Dan: Where do you work?</p>
<p>Jan: I work at Company X. Where do you work?</p>
<p>Dan: Company Y.</p>
<p>&lt;crickets&gt;</p>
<p>Compare that with this conversation:</p>
<p>Dan: Hi, I’m Dan.</p>
<p>Jan: Hi, I’m Jan.</p>
<p>Dan: Where do you work?</p>
<p>Jan: I work at Company X. Where do you work?</p>
<p>Dan: Company Y. We recently launched website Z and are evaluating technology ABC. What has your company recently rolled out?</p>
<p>See the difference? Dan has provided Jan with two avenues for conversation–one is asking further about technology ABC or website Z, and the other is talking about Company X. Jan can decide where to take the conversation, but Dan has provided the start of it.</p>
<p>Learning this trick, which comes naturally to many many people, changed the way I network. Another thing that mattered was my realization that everyone, every single person, has an interesting story or anecdote to tell, and that I can learn something. That understanding has made conversation much more fun.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dan</p>

One of the most delightful parts of being a software engineer and hardware
tinkerer is having the ability to solve my own specific (and often niche)
problems. In this post, the particular problem I’ll be solving is the burning
need to know what is currently playing on <a href="https://www.wqxr.org/">WQXR</a>, NYC’s classical radio station.</p>

<p>A typical Saturday for me looks like this: I wake up and make a coffee, bring
it to the couch in the living room, pick up my knitting, and turn on the radio. Maybe midway through the morning
a halfway-familiar piece comes on, but I’ve left my phone in the other room and won’t be
able to go check the WQXR website without disentangling myself from my
knitting and missing a bit of the piece that has captured my attention.</p>

<p>Or how about a weekday: I’m working on a project, elbows deep in the code, with the WQXR livestream open in one of my million
browser tabs. I feel a glimmer of recognition, but I’m fully focused on my
work and don’t want to break my concentration to go hunt down the livestream
player and find out what it is.</p>

<p>To solve this particular problem, I needed two things: a way to find out what
was on the radio, and a place to display it.</p>

<p>There are a couple of different ways you could find out what’s playing,
including music identification services like Shazam. But those rely on already
having a recording in their database to match against, and I’m listening to
classical music where I could be hearing any one of dozens of different
recordings (and even live performances) for any given piece, making it
unlikely that such a service would be able to find a match. So I started with
the source I was already using to get this information: the WQXR website.</p>

<p>If you leave the website open long enough, you’ll notice that it automatically
updates to reflect what’s currently playing. This was great news for me,
because it meant that somewhere in the page a script is periodically making
ajax requests to get that information, requests that I could also make myself.
To find out what these requests were, I eavesdropped on my browser’s network
calls using the developer console.</p>

<p><img src="http://sarabee.github.io/images/wqxr-network.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>There are two calls being made here, one to an endpoint called streams,
and one to something very promisingly named <code>whats_on</code>. Making a request to
that second endpoint, we get a beautiful json response containing information
about what’s playing on New York Public Radio’s various livestreams. Great!
This is exactly what I need to satisfy the first piece of this project.</p>

<p>(I honestly can’t remember how I figured this out, but you can append the call
letters for the particular station you’re interested in to the URI to just get
information for that stream, but the full response would also have worked just
fine.)</p>

<p>Okay, cool, so I have the data. How do I get this information in front of my
eyeballs when I’m listening to the radio?</p>

<p>You already know from the teaser photo at the top of the post that
I ultimately put it on my mantel, but I took an iterative approach to getting
there.</p>

<p>I use tmux to manage my terminal sessions, and it occurred to me that the
status bar, always there along the bottom of my terminal, might be a nice
place to have information about what’s currently playing. I wrote some
lightweight python classes for fetching and parsing the radio’s API response,
and a tiny script, <code>tmux.py</code> that outputs the information in the format I want for this
purpose.</p>

<p>Adding something to the tmux status bar is just a matter of adding a couple of
lines to <code>.tmux.conf</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>set</span> <span>-g</span> status-right-length 200
<span>set</span> <span>-g</span> status-right <span>'#[bg=#d7ff5f] #(python3
/home/sarabee/development/nowplaying/tmux.py)  |  [%H:%M] '</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This overwrote the clock that was there by default, so I added one back in. By
default, scripts run in <code>.tmux.com</code> are executed once every 15 seconds, which
was more than fast enough for my purpose. My status bar then looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://sarabee.github.io/images/now-playing.jpg"></p>

<p>This fixed the problem of not wanting to leave my terminal to find out what
I’m listening to, but what about when I’m in the living room? I knew I wanted
a display, that I wanted it to update automatically, like the tmux status bar,
that I wanted it to be constantly running, like an indoor thermometer readout,
and that I wanted it to be readable from any position in the room, with good
view angles and readability under a variety of lighting conditions.  This all
sounded to me like the <em>perfect</em> excuse to work with e-paper.</p>

<p><a href="http://shop.pimoroni.com/">Pimoroni</a> was having a sale, so I picked up two e-ink displays: the smaller inkypHAT, and the
larger inkywHAT. I also got a couple of Raspberry Pi Zero Ws to pop them on
top of (quick aside: these things cost $10 and have wifi and bluetooth, wowww).</p>

<p>Starting with the inkypHAT and the code I’d already written for handling radio
data, I prototyped my idea, creating a tiny display that sits on top of my
monitor. I set the Pi Zeroes up the way I set up my larger Raspberry Pi 3,
with Raspbian Lite. Without worrying too much about styling the display
aesthetically, I learned how to work with the
<a href="https://github.com/pimoroni/inky">Inky</a> and
<a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Pillow</a> libraries and
wrote a script to get the composer and title chopped up to fit across multiple
lines on the screen:</p>

<p><img src="http://sarabee.github.io/images/wqxr-phat.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>I have it running once a minute on a cron, and to avoid refreshing the e-ink
display unnecessarily, I keep the last piece written to the display in memory and
update only if I’ve gotten something new back from WQXR.</p>

<p>Reworking this script for the larger inkywHAT display wasn’t difficult; it
mostly involved tweaking font size to take advantage of the larger screen. But
since this is meant to live on my mantel and be highly visible in my living
room, I wanted to make it look a bit nicer than just throwing the text on
there. I found a clip-art scrollwork frame, and using only the MacOS Preview
app and ImageMagick, got it into the right size and format
for the e-ink display.</p>

<p>In Preview, I grabbed a corner of the frame and pasted it in again three more
times, rotated 90 degrees each time, and carefully bumped each corner around
until they were lined up and could be scaled down reasonably to the right
dimensions (400x300px). Even though the image appeared to be entirely black
and white, a closer look shows this wasn’t true at all! It’s actually full of
many different shades of gray:</p>

<p><img src="http://sarabee.github.io/images/whatnow-corner.png" width="300"></p>

<p>To get the image into the right format and flatten it down to just two colors,
I used the <a href="https://imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php">ImageMagick command-line
tools</a>. While <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/quantize/#two_color">this
extremely thorough page</a> in the IM docs goes pretty far in-depth with the
various ways you can convert an image to black and white, I ultimately ended
up going with:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">magick input.png <span>-colorspace</span> gray <span>-colors</span> 2 <span>-normalize</span> PNG8:output.png</code></pre></figure>

<p>Which produces a frame that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://sarabee.github.io/images/whatnow-frame.png"></p>

<p>It’s a little rough when you see it on a relatively high resolution monitor, but looks great on the 400x300 e-ink
display! After that, adding the text was pretty straightforward;
earlier when only displaying text, I was still actually using Pillow to create an empty
image in the correct dimensions that I drew the text onto:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>img</span> <span>=</span> <span>Image</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"P"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>inky_display</span><span>.</span><span>WIDTH</span><span>,</span> <span>inky_display</span><span>.</span><span>HEIGHT</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>To use the frame, I simply started with the frame image instead:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>img</span> <span>=</span> <span>Image</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>os</span><span>.</span><span>path</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>current_dir</span><span>,</span>
<span>"whatnow.png"</span><span>)).</span><span>resize</span><span>(</span><span>inky_display</span><span>.</span><span>resolution</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The last little bit of clean-up work involved getting the text centered in the
frame, and setting the margins in my script so that the line breaks were
a comfortable distance from its edges.</p>

<p><img src="http://sarabee.github.io/images/whatnow-closeup.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>I’m happy with where this project is at; the text is clear and legible from
anywhere in my living room, and my Saturday morning listening experience has
been greatly improved. Eventually, it’ll get custom wooden housing, which will
be its own post, I’m sure! Feel free to dig around in <a href="https://github.com/SaraBee/nowplaying">the project’s repo on
GitHub</a> to get an even better idea of how this all works.</p>

This project is the cradle of an open, transparent digital ecosystem, where data and services can be made available, collated and shared in an environment of trust</strong></p> <p>GAIA-X is a project initiated by Europe for Europe. Its aim is to develop common requirements for a European data infrastructure. Therefore openness, transparency and the ability to connect to other European countries are central to GAIA-X. Representatives from seven European countries are currently involved in the project. We want to invite other European partners to join the project and to contribute to its development. Many dialogues are already underway and will be further intensified. Furthermore, GAIA-X is in continuous exchange with the European Commission.</p> <p>Europe makes extensive investments in digital technologies and innovative business models. We must ensure that those who drive innovations forward are also those who benefit in economic terms. This will help to secure value creation and employment in Europe.<br> An open digital ecosystem is needed to enable European companies and business models to compete globally. This ecosystem should allow both the digital sovereignty of cloud services users and the scalability of European cloud providers.</p> <p>Within the GAIA-X project, we are developing the foundations for a federated, open data infrastructure based on European values. ‘Project GAIA-X’ connects centralised and decentralised infrastructures in order to turn them into a homogeneous, user-friendly system. The resulting federated form of data infrastructure strengthens the ability to both access and share data securely and confidently.</p> </div> </div>  </div> </div> <div id="id2112282" role="listbox" data-slider-speed="5000" data-slider-speed-auto="4000"> <div> <div> <figure> <picture> <source media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/gaia-x-summit-2020.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=2&amp;size=530w"> <source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/gaia-x-summit-2020.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=2&amp;size=768w"> <source media="(max-width: 1039px)" srcset="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/gaia-x-summit-2020.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=2&amp;size=1024w"> <source media="(max-width: 1311px)" srcset="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/gaia-x-summit-2020.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=2&amp;size=1260w"> <source media="(min-width: 1312px)" srcset="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/gaia-x-summit-2020.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=2&amp;size=1900w"> <img src="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/gaia-x-summit-2020.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=2&amp;size=1900w" title="Gaia-X" alt="Gaia-X"> </picture> <figcaption> <p> © ... </p> </figcaption> </figure>  </div>  </div> </div> <div id="id1839162" tabindex="-1"> <div> <div> <p> <span>We invite you to participate in GAIA-X</span> </p> <h2> Together for a European Data Infrastructure </h2> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>We are banking on Europe’s enduring strengths.

<div> <div> <p> <span>Technical Concept</span> </p> <h2> How does GAIA-X work? </h2> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Federated services provide value if they are based on common standards which ensure transparency and interoperability. GAIA-X addresses this requirement by aligning network and interconnection providers, Cloud Solution Providers (CSP), High Performance Computing (HPC) as well as sector specific clouds and edge systems. Here, mechanisms are developed to find, combine and connect services from participating providers in order to enable a user-friendly infrastructure ecosystem. GAIA-X identifies the minimum technical requirements and services necessary to operate the federated GAIA-X Ecosystem. The development of these services will follow the principles of Security by Design and also include the concept of Privacy by Design in order to ensure highest security requirements and privacy protection.</p> <p>Technical implementation of these Federation Services will focus on the following areas:</p> <ul><li>the implementation of secure federated identity and trust mechanisms (security and privacy by design);</li><li>sovereign data services which ensure the identity of source and receiver of data and which ensure the access and usage rights towards the data;</li><li>easy access to the available providers, nodes and services. Data will be provided through federated catalogues; </li><li>the integration of existing standards to ensure interoperability and portability across infrastructure, applications and data; </li><li>the establishment of a compliance framework and Certification and Accreditation services; and</li><li>the contribution of a modular compilation of open source software and standards to support providers in delivering a secure, federated and interoperable infrastructure.</li></ul> <p>The initial set of federation services will be expanded. The roadmap is aligned with the development of ecosystem participants’ requirements.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div id="id1839168" tabindex="-1"> <div> <div> <p> <span>GAIA-X in practice</span> </p> <h2> Use Cases: GAIA-X from the user perspective </h2> </div> <p>GAIA-X gives users access to a broad and highly useful range of specialised products and services from cloud providers, thus enabling the use of tailored solutions. In this context, GAIA-X offers full transparency through the self-description, provides certified data protection and supplies regulatory criteria for the products and services offered.</p>  </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Clear conditions for participation in GAIA-X and for collaboration, and common rules for cross-company authentication and access management will strengthen the underlying level of trust, bring down the obstacles to participation and reduce the amount of work involved in bilateral coordination between individual users.</p> <p>A further important added benefit of GAIA-X is the guarantee of data sovereignty: Each user decides for herself where her data is stored, as well as who may process it and for what purpose, based on the user’s own data classification. In that sense GAIA-X enables modular solutions. Users can also access AI applications and data pools via the trustworthy data infrastructure. Based on standardisation rules and the different options for managing and controlling the transfer of data, data can be exchanged between the companies, linked with other data, processed, evaluated, and monetised in value creation networks. The opportunities of data and service sharing can promote innovations, exploit synergies and enable new business models to be developed and scaled up. </p> <p>The aim of Workstream 1 ‘User ecosystems and requirements’ is to achieve the stated added benefits through a broad and sustained mobilisation of the user and demand perspective. This occurs through continual identification, integration, development and implementation of domain-specific use cases, which illustrate the need for and the added benefit of a sovereign European data infrastructure. The work also focuses on defining domain-specific and cross-domain requirements. These form the foundation for the growth of data infrastructures.</p> <p>In the meantime, more than 40 use cases have been submitted in eight domains (‘Industry 4.0/SME’, ‘Health’, ‘Finance’, ‘Public Sector’, ‘Smart Living’, ‘Energy’, ‘Mobility’ and ‘Agriculture’). They come from various companies and organisations from European countries, including Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland. On the one hand, they illustrate need for and the added benefit of GAIA-X. On the other hand, they each represent a domain and serve as basis to identify and validate domain-specific and cross-domain requirements and to allow these to be incorporated into the development of GAIA-X.</p> <p>All project participants are invited to participate in Workstream 1 ‘User Ecosystems and Requirements’: Both by submitting new use cases and by active and …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

            <article>


            

            <h2>By Bertrand Russell</h2>
            <p>[Originally published in: <strong><cite>The Minority of One</cite>, 6 September 1964, pp.6–8.</strong>]</p>
            <p>The official version of the <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/" title="John F. Kennedy assassination">assassination of President Kennedy</a> has been so riddled with contradictions that it is been abandoned and rewritten no less than three times. Blatant fabrications have received very widespread <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/the-media-and-the-jfk-assassination" title="Media coverage of the JFK assassination">coverage by the mass media</a>, but denials of these same lies have gone unpublished. Photographs, evidence and affidavits have been doctored out of recognition. Some of the most important aspects of <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/how-did-oswald-kill-kennedy" title="The case against Lee Harvey Oswald">the case against Lee Harvey Oswald</a> have been completely blacked out. Meanwhile, the F.B.I., the police and the Secret Service have tried to silence key witnesses or instruct them what evidence to give. Others involved have disappeared or died in extraordinary circumstances.</p>
            <p>It is facts such as these that demand attention, and which the <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/warren-commission-jfk-assassination" title="The Warren Commission's investigation of the JFK assassination">Warren Commission</a> should have regarded as vital. Although I am writing before the publication of the Warren Commission’s report, leaks to the press have made much of its contents predictable. Because of the high office of its members and the fact of its establishment by President Johnson, the Commission has been widely regarded as a body of holy men appointed to pronounce the truth. An impartial examination of the composition and conduct of the Commission suggests quite otherwise.</p>
            <h2>1: Membership of the Warren Commission</h2>
            <p>The Warren Commission has been utterly unrepresentative of the American people. It consisted of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>two Democrats, <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/richard-russell-warren-report" title="Senator Richard Russell's objection to the Warren Report">Senator Russell of Georgia</a> and Congressman Boggs of Louisiana, both of whose racist views have brought shame on the United States;</li>
                <li>two Republicans, Senator Cooper of Kentucky and Congressman Gerald R. Ford of Michigan, the latter of whom is a leader of his local Goldwater movement and an associate of the F.B.I.;</li>
                <li>Allen Dulles, former director of the Central Intelligence Agency,</li>
                <li>and Mr. McCloy, who has been referred to as the spokesman for the business community.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Leadership of the filibuster in the Senate against the Civil Rights Bill prevented Senator Russell from attending hearings during the period. The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, Earl Warren, who rightly commands respect, was finally persuaded, much against his will, to preside over the Commission, and it was his involvement above all else that helped lend the Commission an aura of legality and authority. Yet many of its members were also members of those very groups which have done so much to distort and suppress the facts about the assassination. Because of their connection with the Government, not one member would have been permitted under U.S. law to serve on a jury <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/lee-harvey-oswald-fair-trial" title="Did Lee Harvey Oswald get a fair trial?">had Oswald faced trial</a>. It is small wonder that the Chief Justice himself remarked that the release of some of the Commission’s information “might not be in your lifetime.” Here, then, is my first question: <strong>Why were all the members of the Warren Commission closely connected with the U.S. Government?</strong></p>
            <h2>2 and 3: Conduct and Official Secrecy</h2>
            <p>If the composition of the Commission was suspect, its conduct confirmed one’s worst fears. No counsel was permitted to act for Oswald, so that cross–examination was barred. Later, under pressure, the Commission appointed the President of the American Bar Association, Walter Craig, one of the supporters of the Goldwater movement in Arizona, to represent Oswald. To my knowledge, he did not attend hearings, but satisfied himself with representation by observers.</p>
            <p>In the name of national security, the Commission’s hearings were held in secret, thereby continuing the policy which has marked the entire course of the case. This prompts my second question: <strong>If, as we are told, Oswald was the lone assassin, where is the issue of national security?</strong> Indeed, precisely the same question must be put here as was posed in France during the Dreyfus case: <strong>If the Government is so certain of its case, why has it conducted all its inquiries in the strictest secrecy?</strong></p>
            <h2>4: The Crucial Question Was Not Asked</h2>
            <p>At the outset the Commission appointed six panels through which it would conduct its enquiry. They considered:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>What did Oswald do on November 22, 1963?</li>
                <li>What was Oswald’s background?</li>
                <li>What did Oswald do in the U.S. Marine Corps, and in the Soviet Union?</li>
                <li>How did Ruby kill Oswald?</li>
                <li>What is Ruby’s background?</li>
                <li>What efforts were taken to protect the President on November 22?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This raises my fourth question: <strong>Why did the Warren Commission not establish a panel to deal with the question of who killed President Kennedy?</strong></p>
            <h2>5: Challenging the Commission</h2>
            <p>All the evidence given to the Commission has been classified “Top Secret,” including even a request that hearings be held in public. Despite this the Commission itself leaked much of the evidence to the press, though only if the evidence  tended to prove Oswald the lone assassin. Thus, Chief Justice Warren held a press conference after Oswald’s wife, Marina, had testified. He said that she believed her husband was the assassin. Before Oswald’s brother Robert testified, he gained the Commission’s agreement not to comment on what he said. After he had testified for two days, the newspapers were full of stories that “a member of the Commission” had told the press that Robert Oswald had just testified that he believed that his brother was an agent of the Soviet Union. Robert Oswald was outraged by this, and he said that he could not remain silent while lies were told about his testimony. He had never said this and he had never believed it. All that he had told the Commission was that he believed his brother was innocent and was in no way involved in the assassination.</p>
            <p>The methods adopted by the Commission have indeed been deplorable, but it is important to challenge the entire role of the Warren Commission. It stated that it would not conduct its own investigation, but rely instead on the existing governmental agencies — the F.B.I., the Secret Service and the Dallas police. Confidence in the Warren Commission thus presupposes confidence in these three institutions. <strong>Why have so many liberals abandoned their own responsibility to a Commission whose circumstances they refuse to examine?</strong></p>
            <h2>6: Oswald the Subversive</h2>
            <p>It is known that the strictest and most elaborate security precautions ever taken for a President of the United States were ordered for November 22 in Dallas. The city had a reputation for violence and was the home of some of the most extreme right–wing fanatics in America. Mr. and Mrs. Lyndon Johnson had been assailed there in 1960 when he was a candidate for the Vice–Presidency. Adlai Stevenson had been physically attacked when he spoke in the city only a month before Kennedy’s visit. On the morning of November 22, the <cite>Dallas Morning News</cite> carried a full–page advertisement <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/jfk-assassination-political-context" title="Political context of the JFK assassination">associating the President with Communism</a>. The city was covered with posters showing the President’s picture and headed “Wanted for Treason.” The Dallas list of subversives comprised 23 names, of which Oswald’s was the first. All of them were followed that day, except Oswald. <strong>Why did the authorities follow many persons as potential assassins and fail to observe Oswald’s entry into the book depository building while allegedly carrying a rifle over three feet long?</strong></p>
            <h2>7: The Route of the Motorcade</h2>
            <p>The President’s route for his drive through Dallas was widely known and was printed in the <cite>Dallas Morning News</cite> on November 22. At the last minute the Secret Service changed a small part of their plans so that the President left Main Street and turned into Houston and Elm Streets. This alteration took the President past the book depository building from which it is alleged that Oswald shot him. How Oswald is supposed to have known of this change has never been explained. <strong>Why was the President’s route changed at the last minute to take him past Oswald’s place of work?</strong></p>
            <h2>8: Changing the Evidence</h2>
            <p>After the assassination and Oswald’s arrest, judgment was pronounced swiftly: Oswald was the assassin, and he had acted alone. No attempt was made to arrest others, no road blocks were set up round the area, and every piece of evidence which tended to incriminate Oswald was announced to the press by the Dallas District Attorney, Mr. Wade. In such a way millions of people were prejudiced against Oswald before there was any opportunity for him to be brought to trial. The first theory announced by the authorities was that the President’s car was in Houston Street, approaching the book depository building, when Oswald opened fire. When available photographs and eyewitnesses had shown this to be quite untrue, the theory was abandoned and a new one formulated which placed the vehicle in its correct position. Meanwhile, however, D.A. Wade had announced that three days after Oswald’s room in Dallas had been searched, a map had been found there on which the book depository building had been circled and dotted lines drawn from the building to a vehicle on Houston Street, showing the <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/single-bullet-theory-jfk-assassination" title="JFK assassination bullet trajectory">alleged bullet trajectory</a> had been planned in advance. After the first theory was proved false, the Associated Press put out the following story on November 27: “Dallas authorities announced today that there never was a map.”</p>
            <p>The second theory correctly placed the President’s car on Elm Street, 50 to 75 yards past the book depository, but had to contend with the difficulty that the President was shot from the front, in the throat. <strong>How did Oswald manage to shoot the President in the front from behind?</strong> The F.B.I. held a series of background briefing sessions for <cite>Life</cite> magazine, which in its issue of December 6 explained that the President had turned completely round just at the time he was shot. This too, was soon shown to be entirely false. It …</p></article></div></div>

Often this is the realm of absurdly costly lab equipment, source code isn’t published etc.&nbsp; Here i would like to demonstrate this using the simplest equipment and means, and make it very easy to reproduce.</p>
<p>To transmit an elecromagnetic wave one needs to have a conductor driven by a high frequency source. Various busses are used: monitor cables, pci buses etc. Here i propose the use of ethernet.</p>
<p>An ethernet cable consists of 4 twisted pair lines with 100ohm impedance., which carries RF signals in the tens to hundredths MHz range. Any imperfections in the cable (asymetry etc) or in the interface will cause radio signals to be radiated.</p>
<p>Signals can be modulated using different methods. Here i will use morse code for simplicity. This also allows one to judge the signal to noise ratio by just listening. It is also possible to decode it by ear without additional devices if one knows morse code, if not there is a lot of software that can do it (although usually with much worse performance than an experienced human operator).</p>
<p>Transmission is implemented via very simple shell scripts. Only bash, ethtool and ping is needed. This enables the script to be used easily on embedded devices and other platforms where shipping binaries, installing a python environment etc might be a problem.</p>
<p>The proof-of-concept scripts are avaliable at <a href="https://github.com/sq5bpf/etherify">https://github.com/sq5bpf/etherify</a></p>
<p><strong>Etherify 1 – transmitting by switching speed</strong></p>
<p>Various ethernet speeds have different modulation speeds, types and encoding. By switching between we can modulate the RF signal leaking from the wires.</p>
<p>10base-T uses manchester encoding with 10MHz symbol rate. This is used as the space signal (logical 0).</p>
<p>100base-T uses 4B5B encoding with NRZI at 125MHz symbol rate . This results in an easy to receive signal around 125MHz, this is used as the mark signal (logical 1).</p>
<p>Ethernet transmits an idle sequence when no packets are carried, so the signal is constant. No packets have to be transmitted for the signal to be present, on the speed of the interface has to be changed.</p>
<p>The transmission is implemented by a simple bash script, which sends the content of a short text file given as the argument, or “etherify demo” if none is given. The signal can be received as morse code around 125MHz, please use USB or CW mode in the receiver and use a narrow filter.</p>
<p>Demo:</p>
<p>Ensure that the two raspberry PIs are connected and that there is an ethernet link between them (signalled via the LEDs).</p>
<p>Run as root:</p>
<p>./etherify1</p>
<p>to transmit “etherify demo” or to exfiltrate the contents of /tmp/secret.txt</p>
<p>./etherify1 /tmp/secret.txt</p>
<p>Listen to the signal at 125MHz as described below.</p>

<p>The is decodable by ear with a simple Moxon directional antenna and a ham radio receiver (SDR could be used too).</p>
<p>This results in a strong signal at 15m distance:</p>

<p>If in doubt let an experienced amateur radio operator decode it. I was not able to decode the signal at 100m with software.</p>
<p><strong>Etherify 2 – transmitting by sending data</strong></p>
<p>Sending a stream of data at 1Gbps also produces a detectable signal change at 125MHz. There may be other frequencies where the signals were more readable, but equipment was avaliable to receive at 125MHz. This probably works by loading the supply voltage when the packets are generated. A change of voltage probably changes the frequency of some clock slightly, thus generating FSK (F1A to be exact). Note that this doesn’t work with all hardware, which could be explained by the hypothesis about the frequency being modulated by the interface load.</p>
<p>A large volume of traffic represents a logical 1, while no traffic represents logical 0.</p>
<p>The transmission is implemented as a simple bash script, which sends the content of a short text file given as the argument, or “etherify demo” if none is given. The signal can be received as morse code around 125MHz, please use USB or CW mode in the receiver and use a narrow filter, also AM mode can be used.</p>
<p>Demo:</p>
<p>Ensure that the two raspberry PIs are connected and that there is an ethernet link between them (signalled via the LEDs). Set one raspberry PI to 192.168.1.1/24 and the other to 192.168.1.2/24 (the IP address can be changed in the etherify2 script). Ensure that the two raspberry PIs have IP connectivity and can ping each other, and that he interface rate is 1Gbps.</p>
<p>On the 192.168.1.2 raspberry PI run as root:</p>
<p>./etherify2</p>
<p>to transmit “etherify demo” or to exfiltrate the contents of /tmp/secret.txt</p>
<p>./etherify2 /tmp/secret.txt</p>
<p>Listen to the signal at 125MHz as described below.</p>
<p>The signal was decodable by ear at a distance of 30m with a simple Moxon directional antenna and a ham radio receiver.</p>
<p>This results in a strong signal at 15m distance:</p>

<p><strong>Equipment used and experiment description</strong></p>
<p>The RF radiation differs with different equipment and ethernet cable type being used. In order to make this demo reproducible i used two Raspberry PI 4, because it makes it easy for everyone to obtain the exact hardware that was used for this experiment. The raspberry PIs were connected using the ethernet cable supplied with the official Raspberry PI 4 starter kit. The stock Raspbian 10 operating system, which was supplied on the SD cards&nbsp; in the Starter Kit, was used. The devices were accessed via the serial console.</p>
<p>Power was provided via powerbanks. This was to avoid a connection to the mains voltage, because the powerline could be an unintentional radiator.</p>
<p>The Raspberry PIs were laid on a wooden bench about 1.4m from each other.</p>
<p>The experiment was conducted in an electromagnetically quiet area.</p>
<figure id="attachment_83" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-83"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lipkowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rpi_etherify.jpg" alt="" width="843" height="355"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-83">Raspberry PI etherify demo</figcaption></figure>
<p>The signal was received via a Moxon antenna built for 125MHz and a Yaesu FT-817 transceiver with a 500Hz CW filter. Morse code was received and decoded by ear.</p>
<p>The experiments can be repeated with other devices with ethernet ports, for example two laptops, running any linux distribution and the required tools installed (most will come with them out of the box). The devices should be able to establish an ethernet link very quickly upon switching speed. An SDR receiver can be used for reception, with any antenna that can receive 125MHz (test first at close range). Morse code decoding can be done via software, for example fldigi [3].</p>
<p>The easiest receive setup would probably be gqrx with an rtl-sdr dongle, and fldigi for deciding the signals. If the signal is not decoded, it should be played to someone who can receive morse code by ear. Often such person will be able to decode it with ease.</p>
<p>The experiment should be first conducted in an electromagnetically quiet area, nearby ethernet networks will generate a lot of interference. If testing in the vicinity of other ethernet networks move the antenna closer, and reduce the receiver gain as much as possible.</p>
<p><strong>How to replicate with your own hardware</strong></p>
<p>This can be replicated with other ethernet hardware, but with varying results.</p>
<p>The speed at which the ethernet hardware can renegotiate different speed sets the maximum speed of etherify 1 transmission. The&nbsp; ethernet port on the raspberry pi 4 can change speed very quickly. Other hardware will have a delay when chaging speed, for example on an Dell Latitude 5310 running with Debian bullseye (e1000e 3.2.6-k driver) it takes about 5 seconds to change speed. Lower modulation speed means lower datarate, but also better signal/noise when decoding.</p>
<p>The clock frequency modulation under packet load observed on the raspberry pi 4 (etherify 2) is specific to the raspberry pi 4. However loading the interface with packets often has effects on the electromagnetic spectrum on different hardware.</p>
<p>To check your hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li>look at the spectrum around 125MHz</li>
<li>ensure that the interface is up</li>
<li>change speed with ethtool to 10Mbps, 100Mbps, 1Gbps and observe the spectrum</li>
<li>try enabling/disabling eee (energy efficient ethernet), observe the effects at different speeds</li>
<li>try loading the interface with packets, observe the effects at different speeds</li>
<li>look at different ethtool settings and module options, especially those concerning power saving, carrier delay etc.</li>
<li>allow a few seconds after changing each parameter, on some interfaces it takes some time to change parameters</li>
<li>keep in mind that both ends of the ethernet link have an effect on he transmission. For experiments it’s best to use the same hardware on both ends.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find something interesting, then please send me an email.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The signal was shown to be decodable by ear at 100m for etherify 1, and 30m for etherify 2. This was done via a simple antenna and modest receiver. An antenna with more gain and better receiver would surely yield better range.</p>
<p>Nearby ethernet networks will generate a lot of interference at the same frequencies. The 125MHz frequency falls in the 108-137MHz air band, and one can expect interference from strong signals on nearby frequencies from nearby airplanes and airports. Therefore first tests should be conducted in areas with less interference, such as outdoor areas or underground parking lots.</p>
<p>The 125MHz frequency was chosen because of avaliable equipment. It would be hard for one person to hold and operate an antenna, laptop and SDR receiver. Other frequencies may be better.</p>
<p>Etherify 1 yields better range, however etherify 2 may enable to use a device located somewhere else in the network as the transmitter. This device may be physically closer to the receiver or may have greater leakage from the ethernet cable. Etherify 2 can be exploited as a non-root user by flooding the network with UDP datagrams or possibly other data.</p>
<p>The “software” side is intentionally a very primitive silly hack.</p>
<p>I haven’t done an extensive search for similar prior publications, but a few quick searches didn’t yield any results. If you know of any, please let me know.</p>

    <article>
        <h4>Published: November 6, 2020</h4>
        
<p>I’ve been studying quite a bit of modern C++ (using C++17) lately because of a side project and I have picked up some oddities and gotchas when it comes to pointers, specifically smart pointers.</p>
<p>I must note that I am by no means a seasoned C++ Engineer, nevertheless, I ran &amp; debugged all the examples below on Mac OS Catalina 10.15.7.</p>

<p>These are the helpers to instantiate a smart pointer.</p>
<p>Now consider the following example where we would just instantiate a base class <code>Animal</code>.
There are many ways to instantiate <code>Animal</code> as a <code>unique_ptr</code>. I listed the most common below.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;memory&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>class</span> <span>Animal</span> {
<span>public</span><span>:</span>
    <span>virtual</span> <span>~</span>Animal() <span>=</span> <span>default</span>;
    <span>virtual</span> std<span>::</span>string name() <span>const</span> {
        <span>return</span> <span>"I'm an animal"</span>;
    }
};

<span>int</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>// using 'new' keyword
</span><span></span>    std<span>::</span>unique_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span> buddyA(<span>new</span> Animal);
    std<span>::</span>unique_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span> buddyB <span>=</span> std<span>::</span>unique_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span>(<span>new</span> Animal);
    <span>auto</span>                    buddyC <span>=</span> std<span>::</span>unique_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span>(<span>new</span> Animal);

    <span>// using make_unique helper
</span><span></span>    std<span>::</span>unique_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span> charlieA <span>=</span> std<span>::</span>make_unique<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span>(Animal());
    <span>auto</span>                    charlieB <span>=</span> std<span>::</span>make_unique<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span>(Animal());
}
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, the last option where we instantiate <code>Animal</code> into <code>charlieB</code> variable looks pretty easy. The main advantage
of using <code>make_unique</code> is the lack of <code>new</code> keyword. That’s because <code>new</code> resonates manual memory management and modern C++ would
like you to avoid using it when using smart pointers, because the smart pointer will always call delete in its destructor.</p>
<p>Use make_unique they said, avoid using <code>new</code> they said, and so I did. Until I hit a roadblock when debugging a polymorphic object
that was supposed to be a derived class in runtime, but behaved as a base class.</p>
<p>Remember the Animal base class from above? We’ll add <code>Dog</code> class below that will inherit from <code>Animal</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>class</span> <span>Dog</span><span>:</span> <span>public</span> Animal {
<span>public</span><span>:</span>
    std<span>::</span>string name() <span>const</span> <span>override</span> {
        <span>return</span> <span>"I'm a dog"</span>;
    }
};
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can try to implement polymorphism by creating an instance of <code>Dog</code> into an <code>Animal</code> pointer.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>int</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>auto</span> charlieB <span>=</span> std<span>::</span>make_unique<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span>(Dog());
    
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Name is: "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> charlieB<span>-&gt;</span>name() <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
    <span>// Output -&gt; Name is: I'm an animal
</span><span></span>}
</code></pre></div><p>Isn’t that weird? We created a Dog object! Well, yes and no. Let’s break it down:</p>
<ol>
<li>We created an instance of <code>Dog</code></li>
<li>The instance was passed as an argument to <code>make_unique</code></li>
<li>Here it comes, if you look at source code of <code>make_unique</code> function, you’ll see it’s primitive. It just creates
a new object of type <code>T</code> (<code>Animal</code> in our case) on the heap, using <code>new</code> operator. We could express the internal operation as:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++">Dog d;
Animal<span>*</span> a <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Animal(d);
</code></pre></div><p>So yes, we did pass a Dog object, but it will be downcast to Animal in order to create a new instance of Animal using one of the built-in constructors:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>// Animal has this generated constructor (among others) by default
</span><span></span>Animal(<span>const</span> Animal<span>&amp;</span>);
</code></pre></div><h3 id="edit---thanks-to-crifferiushttpstwittercomcrifferius-and-arganoidhttpstwittercomarganoid">Edit - thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/crifferius">@crifferius</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/arganoid">@arganoid</a></h3>
<p>The scenario from above leads to an incorrect and confusing behavior. It was my understanding of <code>make_shared</code> &amp; <code>make_unique</code> that was incorrect.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I think it’s still important to mention it, as the program compiles successfully (no warnings), with an unexpected behavior,
especially for people coming to C++ from another language.</p>
<p><code>make_unique</code> and <code>make_shared</code> actually forward parameters, so you should use them with the derived class type as shown below for <code>charlieC</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>int</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>auto</span> charlieB <span>=</span> std<span>::</span>unique_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span>(<span>new</span> Dog());
    std<span>::</span>unique_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span> charlieC <span>=</span> std<span>::</span>make_unique<span>&lt;</span>Dog<span>&gt;</span>(); <span>// Preferred
</span><span></span>    
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Name is: "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> charlieB<span>-&gt;</span>name() <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
    <span>// Output -&gt; Name is: I'm a dog
</span><span></span>}
</code></pre></div><p>If the <code>Dog</code> had parameters in a constructor, you would simply pass those into the <code>make_shared</code> / <code>make_unique</code> helper
as shown below:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C++"><span>// Let's modify Dog only for this example
</span><span></span><span>class</span> <span>Dog</span><span>:</span> <span>public</span> Animal {
    std<span>::</span>string name_;
<span>public</span><span>:</span>
    Dog(std<span>::</span>string name) <span>:</span> name_(name) {}

    std<span>::</span>string name() <span>const</span> <span>override</span> {
        <span>return</span> <span>"I'm a dog: "</span> <span>+</span> name_;
    }
};

<span>int</span> <span>main</span>() {
    std<span>::</span>unique_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span> charlieC <span>=</span> std<span>::</span>make_unique<span>&lt;</span>Dog<span>&gt;</span>(<span>"Poodle"</span>);
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Name is: "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> charlieB<span>-&gt;</span>name() <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
    <span>// Output -&gt; Name is: I'm a dog: Poodle
</span><span></span>}
</code></pre></div>
<p>References are great. They are like pointers, but cannot be <strong>nullptr</strong> (you could technically workaround and store <strong>NULL/nullptr</strong> in a reference, but that leads to undefined behavior and I won’t present such a bad practice here).</p>
<p>Not only references are not optional, but they also depict another paradigm. When we accept a reference parameter in a function/method,
it means we don’t own the underlying value, nor we store it, although we might modify it (depending on whether the parameter is marked as <code>const</code>).</p>
<p>The first section of this article mentioned polymorphism. Given our examples above, we might need an array of <code>Animal</code> objects. Some could be <code>Dog</code>, <code>Cat</code>, or other. We might not know in compile time.</p>
<p>Now what if we need to walk through though the array and if it’s a dog, we want to print out the breed? For that, we will need casting.
There are multiple types of casting, let me just briefly introduce just a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>static_cast</code> - casts as a given type, no runtime check</li>
<li><code>dynamic_cast</code> - casts as a given type, if it’s compatible. It will run a runtime check. In case of an error, if we’re casting to a pointer, the result will be a <code>nullptr</code> value. If we’re casting to a reference, a <code>std::bad_cast</code> exception will be thrown.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also cast helpers when you work with <code>shared_ptr</code>. Those are convenient as they unwrap the smart pointer for us.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>std::dynamic_pointer_cast</code></li>
<li><code>std::static_pointer_cast</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s modify our original example a bit:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a virtual method breed() in <code>Dog</code> class</li>
<li>Create <code>Husky</code> class that inherits from <code>Dog</code> and implements breed()</li>
<li>Create <code>Cat</code> class just to have another type of animal</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>class</span> <span>Dog</span><span>:</span> <span>public</span> Animal {
<span>public</span><span>:</span>
    <span>virtual</span> <span>~</span>Dog() <span>=</span> <span>default</span>;
    <span>virtual</span> std<span>::</span>string breed() <span>const</span> {
        <span>throw</span> std<span>::</span>runtime_error(<span>"Dog.breed() should be implemented by a derived class"</span>);
    }

    std<span>::</span>string name() <span>const</span> <span>override</span> {
        <span>return</span> <span>"I'm a dog"</span>;
    }
};

<span>class</span> <span>Cat</span><span>:</span> <span>public</span> Animal {
    std<span>::</span>string name() <span>const</span> <span>override</span> {
        <span>return</span> <span>"I'm a cat"</span>;
    }
};

  std<span>::</span>string breed() <span>const</span> <span>override</span> {
      <span>return</span> <span>"Husky"</span>;
  }
};
</code></pre></div><p>Time to create our animal array. Remember, not all animals are dogs, so we’ll first have to try to upcast an <code>Animal&amp;</code> to a <code>Dog&amp;</code> and if it works,
we can print out the breed.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++">
<span>void</span> <span>printDogBreed</span>(<span>const</span> Animal<span>&amp;</span> animal);

<span>int</span> <span>main</span>() {
    std<span>::</span>vector<span>&lt;</span>std<span>::</span>shared_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;&gt;</span> animals;

    animals.emplace_back(std<span>::</span>shared_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span>(<span>new</span> Husky));
    animals.emplace_back(std<span>::</span>shared_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span>(<span>new</span> Cat));

    <span>for</span> (<span>const</span> <span>auto</span><span>&amp;</span> animal : animals) {
        <span>// ignore this function for now, we'll define it in a minute
</span><span></span>        printDogBreed(<span>*</span>animal);
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>We created an array with one dog and one cat. The function <code>printDogBreed</code> is yet to be defined. We will want to pass
a reference of <code>Animal</code> to the function and let it either print out the breed (if the animal is a dog) or do nothing.</p>
<p>For those who don’t know, the asterisk operator in <code>shared_ptr</code> is overloaded to return a reference of the stored object.</p>
<p>Let’s define <code>printDogBreed</code> function now:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>void</span> <span>printDogBreed</span>(<span>const</span> Animal<span>&amp;</span> animal) {
    <span>try</span> {
        <span>auto</span> dog <span>=</span> <span>dynamic_cast</span><span>&lt;</span><span>const</span> Dog<span>&amp;&gt;</span>(animal);
        std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Breed is: "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> dog.breed() <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
    } <span>catch</span> (<span>const</span> std<span>::</span>bad_cast<span>&amp;</span> e) {
        <span>// do nothing, it's not a dog
</span><span></span>    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>This is pretty straightforward no? We take a const reference of <code>Animal</code> (as we don’t need to modify it) and try
to upcast it to a Dog reference.</p>
<p>We would expect (or I would anyway), that the program would output our husky dog breed. Unfortunately, that’s not what happens.</p>
<p>The application will crash on a <code>std::runtime_error</code> exception thrown from the base <code>Dog</code> class’ <code>breed()</code> method.</p>

<p>Well, that’s a good question. The underlying object is a <code>Dog</code>, but most importantly it’s <code>Husky</code>, so we would expect
the virtual method <code>breed()</code> to print out <code>Husky</code>.</p>
<p>For some reason (I would really love to give you a full in-detail explanation on this, if you know, please message us on <a href="https://twitter.com/digreverie">twitter</a>.), the cast
itself is valid, but it’s also hard-wired to <code>Dog</code> type, or its vtable is erased, who knows.</p>
<p>If we were to replace the line and cast directly to <code>Husky</code>, everything would work as expected. But we don’t want to specify the type of dog. As we might add more types in the future.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>auto</span> dog <span>=</span> <span>dynamic_cast</span><span>&lt;</span><span>const</span> Husky<span>&amp;&gt;</span>(animal);
</code></pre></div><h3 id="cast-to-pointer-for-the-rescue">Cast to pointer for the rescue</h3>
<p>Luckily, the solution is rather simple. We “just” have to cast to a <code>Dog</code> pointer, that will behave correctly in runtime, dispatching the right virtual method.
Notice the <code>&amp;</code> before animal. We’re basically taking an address of the <code>Animal</code> reference, which will lead us to the pointer.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>void</span> <span>printDogBreed</span>(<span>const</span> Animal<span>&amp;</span> animal) {
    <span>if</span> (<span>auto</span> dog <span>=</span> <span>dynamic_cast</span><span>&lt;</span><span>const</span> Dog<span>*&gt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>animal)) {
        std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Breed is: "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> dog<span>-&gt;</span>breed() <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
    }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>This one almost got me bald from pulling my hair. Consider the following code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span> 1</span><span>// Note this function defines a reference of shared_ptr as the function parameter.
</span><span><span> 2</span><span></span><span>void</span> <span>shuffleAnimal</span>(std<span>::</span>function<span>&lt;</span><span>void</span>(std<span>::</span>shared_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;&amp;</span>)<span>&gt;</span> f) {
</span><span> 3</span>    <span>auto</span> animal <span>=</span> std<span>::</span>shared_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span>(<span>new</span> Husky);
<span> 4</span>    f(animal);
<span> 5</span>
<span> 6</span>    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Picked animal name: "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> animal<span>-&gt;</span>name() <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
<span> 7</span>}
<span> 8</span>
<span> 9</span><span>int</span> <span>main</span>() {
<span>10</span>    <span>// but caller can implement it without a reference, as such:
</span><span><span>11</span><span></span>    shuffleAnimal([](std<span>::</span>shared_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span> animal) {
</span><span>12</span>        animal.reset(<span>new</span> Cat);
<span>13</span>    });
<span>14</span>}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The function <code>shuffleAnimal</code> lets the caller shuffle the initial Animal it provides. As you can see, we provide a mutable
reference of <code>shared_ptr</code>.</p>
<p>Notice the caller does <strong>NOT</strong> implement the parameter correctly, as it omits the reference mark!</p>
<p>This would not fly with <code>unique_ptr</code> those cannot be copied, so you’d encounter a compilation error.</p>
<p>Since this program will build …</p></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Californians voted Yes on <a href="https://vig.cdn.sos.ca.gov/2020/general/pdf/topl-prop24.pdf">Prop 24</a>, approving extensive amendments to the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB1121">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> with the mindset of strengthening the U.S.’s most comprehensive data privacy regulation to date. But one of its provisions undermines that goal in a way that puts both individual privacy and corporate security at a heightened risk.<br></p><p>Specifically, a collection of amendments grants service providers expanded powers to combine consumer datasets obtained from different sources (see Secs. 1798.140(ag)(1) and 1798.185(e)(10)).<strong> In the world of data anonymization, the risks of combining datasets </strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10933-3/"><strong>are</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/researchers-spotlight-the-lie-of-anonymous-data/"><strong>well</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/12/181207144403.htm"><strong>known</strong></a><strong>.</strong> When paired with additional data, individuals in many anonymized datasets are surprisingly easy to re-identify. This can be due to uneven approaches in anonymization, as well as the simple benefit of added data points. Real-world instances include <a href="https://fpf.org/wp-content/uploads/The-Re-identification-of-Governor-Welds-Medical-Information-Daniel-Barth-Jones.pdf">anonymized medical records</a> being re-identified when pooled with voter databases; the infamous <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0610105">Netflix user re-identification</a> achieved by combining anonymized Netflix data with IMDB user movie ratings; and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonchandler/2019/09/04/researchers-use-big-data-and-ai-to-remove-legal-confidentiality/?sh=24ba16ec15f6">anonymized Swiss Supreme Court cases</a> involving pharmaceutical companies being re-identified using publicly available databases.<br></p><p>We’ve talked previously about how the <a href="https://www.tonic.ai/post/ccpa-will-hit-your-dev-team-harder-than-gdpr">CCPA impacts dev teams</a> thanks to its extremely broad definition of the types of data requiring protection. Today, we’ll look at how Prop 24 throws that data under the bus by loosening its restrictions on data pooling.<br></p><h3>A practical example<br></h3><p>Imagine there’s a handful of companies in the same industry, say EdTech, all working with the same third-party service provider to debug software, perform testing, or develop apps. Each of these companies anonymizes their users’ data prior to sharing it with the service provider. Thanks to Prop 24, the service provider pools those datasets to maximize their work. Then the service provider experiences a breach. Individually, those anonymized user datasets may have been safe from re-identification. But combined, they make it much easier to connect the dots and re-identify users with as much as a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10933-3/">99.9% rate of accuracy</a>.<br></p><p>The end result? Multiple companies grappling with crisis management thanks to a single data leak of “anonymized” data. The inclusion of this provision in the newly-passed Prop 24 significantly weakens the individual privacy protections that the CCPA otherwise aims to safeguard. What’s more, it weakens a company’s ability to ensure the privacy of their data when working with third parties.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f0ae1534d32e5a91598eb9c/5fa5e8d498f39f28e061d229_wpTaqICtlYpRVLx4exhENOlsJh4wo898y97N_2Hhc6DJKYk06ryDg5nZj1yv5gBOa0s9DHtrJhQYE8CEg8WAzHkT_NqrcOsbFFUp_m75LDSJTiJVx742PBA69hqfJQSgvMrT25dm.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3><strong>What to do about it</strong><br></h3><p>More and more companies are relying on third-party providers to expand their development teams, outsource QA testing, or engage in other ways that rely on shared datasets. Where the law opens the door to data pooling, concerned companies should specify in their contracts if they want that door kept firmly shut.<br></p><p>But maybe a company stands to benefit from the provider having a larger pool of data to work with. In that case, here are two approaches that allow for reaping the benefits of working with third-parties without upping the risks to data security.<br></p><h4>Ironclad data de-identification</h4><p>Simple redaction, pseudonymization, and sampling aren’t going to cut it. Advanced subsetting paired with full database obfuscation? Now we’re talking. Data beyond what the law defines as “sensitive personal information” and “unique identifiers” could be used to re-identify individuals when combined with other datasets. Taking a more comprehensive approach to data de-identification provides the safeguards needed against re-identification due to data pooling. And with tools like those available in <a href="https://www.tonic.ai/product">Tonic</a> to link columns and preserve relationships in the protected output dataset, companies can strengthen their data security without sacrificing their data’s utility.</p><h4>Data synthesis with differential privacy&nbsp;</h4><p>For the strongest in data security, data synthesis performed with differential privacy at its core not only provides mathematical guarantees for data protection, it also allows for scaling up datasets to any size to equip developers with the amount of realistic, yet wholly fictitious, data they need to do their best work. Here, too, Tonic is <a href="https://www.tonic.ai/post/differential-privacy-comes-to-tonic">leading the charge</a>.<br></p><h3>Why companies should act<br></h3><p>Two additional components of Prop 24 and the CPPA are worth highlighting. First, Prop 24 establishes the California Privacy Protection Agency, expanding the resources available to implement and enforce the CCPA (see Sec. 1798.199.10). This strengthens the state’s ability to take legal action against companies that violate privacy rights.<br></p><p>Second, Prop 24 missed an opportunity to bring the CCPA in line with GDPR in requiring that companies have <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/yes-how-opt-in-consent-really-works/">users opt into data collection</a>, as opposed to leaving the burden with users to opt out. Essentially what this means is that under the CCPA privacy is not the default. And most consumers won’t take the time to click through pop-ups, on/off forms, or privacy settings to make the opt-out change.<br></p><p>This leaves the onus on companies to do right by the data they're collecting by default in order to avoid the legal ramifications that are now easier to enforce.<br></p><p>CCPA and Prop 24 are designed to protect consumers. In the best of worlds, protecting consumers also means protecting businesses from the fallout of poor data practices. Despite its best intentions, Prop 24 stumbles in achieving these goals. Enabling service providers to combine datasets makes companies who work with third-parties more vulnerable to data leaks, despite the protections those companies may have put in place through data anonymization.</p><p>Where Prop 24 does succeed is in paving a clear path for taking legal action against companies who misuse or fail to protect their users’ data. It’s up to companies to implement strong data protection practices regardless of the law’s lax requirements, to avoid costly fines and damaging leaks.<br></p></div><div><h2>What’s a Rich Text element?</h2><p>The rich text element allows you to create and format headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, images, and video all in one place instead of having to add and format them individually.

<p>And then… What if you stack ranked the meetings against each other? How might you prioritize?</p>



<p><strong>The Top Five</strong><br>Meet Chris, a product lead. They prioritized meetings starting with those critical to ensuring that their product was fit for customer love and business purpose… and that the business was fit for human growth, sustainability, and joy.

<![CDATA[Go in Production – Lessons Learned]]>

November 6, 2020 | https://tdom.dev/go-in-production | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tdom.dev/go-in-production">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently got a DevOps job that mostly involves writing a new backend system in Go completely from scratch. Here's what I learned having never actually used it in production, knowing it mostly just from personal projects.</p>

<p>At the start, we decided to try simply sticking with Go's http library and a simple routing library - <code> mux</code>.</p>
<p>However, I quickly ran into real-life, production problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recovery middleware </strong> -  for logging &amp; silently handling panics in handler's code.</li>
<li><strong>Logging </strong> -  I wanted some solution that would print information about each request, including body params, auth tokens, etc. (for debugging purposes).</li>
<li><strong>Better error handling </strong> -  I wanted the errors to still be JSON responses with an error message and code.</li>
<li><strong>Other commonly-used middleware </strong> -  including JWT auth and CORS.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had two options; implement solutions to the above problems myself, use different 3rd party libraries for each problem, or pick a web framework that already does most (if not all) of these things.</p>
<p>I eventually decided to use the Echo web framework. With almost 20k GitHub stars, a pretty active community, and great documentation I thought it was a great tool for the job.</p>
<p><img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/echo-site.png" alt="echo site"></p>
<p>I also found there to be a little less boilerplate when it comes to writing the apps in <code>echo</code> (mainly when parsing a json body, writing errors, and manually setting headers), leading to improved code readability.</p>
<p><img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/echo-cmp-simple.png" alt="comparison"></p>
<p>However the real difference in productivity will be noticed when you have slightly more complex endpoints. You'll often run into cases where you need to validate certain JSON fields, and you'll want meaningful error messages describing what's wrong. If you want to do that without any library, your code will quickly become much harder to read:</p>
<p><img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/echo-cmp-large.png" alt="comparison"></p>

<p>Go web frameworks (or go in general) don't enforce any particular file structure. If you ever used something like ASP.NET/ASP.NET Core, you'll know what I'm talking about when I say that some frameworks are tightly structured and many things are done implicitly by convention rather than explicitly specified.</p>
<p>The thing about Go is that it's really easy to skip learning about structuring your code and make it a hard to read+maintain mess. If you still don't know what I'm talking about, here's an example of a (<strong>bad</strong>) Go endpoint I wrote a while back:</p>
<p><img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/bad-good-structure.png" alt="bad code"></p>
<p>Do you see what I mean? It's quite likely that the in total the "better" way will contain more lines in total after adding all the <code>CreateUser</code> and <code>CreateAgency</code> methods, but… It will be much easier to understand, reuse, debug, and modify later on as each method will have a single purpose.
If you haven't already, I highly recommend you have a look at the following resources for a good code structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ribice/gorsk">https://github.com/ribice/gorsk</a> - nice example of a basic REST API</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bxcodec/go-clean-arch">https://github.com/bxcodec/go-clean-arch</a> - also a REST API example, but more strictly following the "Clean Architecture" concepts</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, the concept is simple. You should separate the code that communicates with the database from the actual application logic itself, which should also stay separate from the transport/endpoint logic (in this example the HTTP endpoints).</p>

<p>When I first started programming in Go, I wanted to use the least libraries possible, so of course I opted in for using the <code>database/sql</code> package (with Postgres). Although the experience was OK, I came across quite a lot of boilerplate when querying data, especially having to use the Scan syntax.
This lead me to the following 2 options:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sqlx </code> -  a lightweight wrapper on top of <code>database/sql</code> with some extensions that will make querying much easier.</li>
<li><code>gorm </code> -  an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)  library for Go, which generates SQL models and queries based on your Go models.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't think there's a clear "better" library, in the end it comes down to the use case and preference.</p>
<p><code>gorm</code> will probably make your life easier, especially if you often forget to add fields to queries after altering the database (because in gorm you won't have to do that at all).&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>sqlx</code> on the other hand is much more SQL centric, it's more like writing Go code to interface with SQL rather than gorm 's approach of generating SQL from Go code. It's nice if you prefer to have total control over your SQL and not having to learn new syntax of GORM.</p>

<p>One of the challenges I came across was configuring the project for production. There are always some differences between the dev and prod environments, such as what port the app should run on, the host and credentials for the database, and etc.</p>
<p>I've seen people configure their app variables via JSON, YAML, or even gitignored&nbsp;.go files. I personally found env files to work the best, especially with docker-compose:</p>
<p><img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/docker-env.png" alt=".env">
<img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/docker-compose.png" alt="docker-compose">
I usually combine these with the following utility functions:
<img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/env-util.png" alt="Dockerfile">
Building the Docker image is also extremely easy in Go.:
<img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/dockerfile.png" alt="Dockerfile"></p>

<p>There are also a few other things that came to my mind that I didn't consider worth their own sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tour.golang.org/basics/7">Named returns in Go</a></li>
<li><a href="https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html">Effective Go</a></li>

                <p>My favorite part about side projects comes after the initial build is complete and I can focus on scaling. At this point, it's valuable to consider tools that can help you focus on the main goal: Talking to and acquiring users in a data-driven manner. I've been through this process a few times now and wanted to take a minute to share my go-to tools:</p><p><br>🛠 <a href="http://arctype.com/">Arctype</a></p><p>Arctype is an easy to use SQL client. It looks and feels like a modern spreadsheet, making it one of the most user-friendly SQL clients on the market. Some of my favorite features overall includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Managing queries:</strong> I use it to query specific segments of users and have most of my queries for these segments saved. That way, I don't have to re-write long queries every time I wish to investigate my data.</li><li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Arctype is designed to be a better alternative for teams. You can give team members different levels of access, share queries, and dashboards.</li><li><strong>Creating super simple dashboards (see below):</strong> I love tracking metrics from day 0 on my side projects. Understanding total users, increase, churn and more is super helpful. Arctype lets you build these dashboard easily through SQL queries.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2020/11/ezgif-3-a939f4dbebc4--1-.gif" alt=""><figcaption>The process of creating a table on the dashboard is simple and quick</figcaption></figure><p>Best part? It's free!</p><p>📈 <a href="http://getwaitlist.com/">Waitlist</a></p><p>Waitlist is a tool to increase sign-ups via gamified referrals. With their <a href="https://gist.github.com/Ryan-Ouyang/3727a28efe47c0a984b8de111aadffe4">no-code integrations</a>, it takes less than 5 minutes to set up a waitlist on your webpage. I specifically use it for:</p><ul><li><strong>User research:</strong> If users are willing to share your product with other users, that's already a positive sign. Reaching out to these users to understand their expectations and use cases can provide valuable information.</li><li><strong>Rewards:</strong> During its earliest days, Dropbox grew through its referral program. The vast majority of Dropbox users had free accounts with limited storage space. However, every user was given more free space for any additional users they sign up. Specifying rewards for users for successful referrals can further boost your growth.</li><li><strong>Demand:</strong> An important tool for marketing your product is showing excitement and traction. If you can begin markeitng your product and its demand already before launch, you can set yourself up for an incredible launch day.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-03-at-14.41.26.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-03-at-14.41.26.png 600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-03-at-14.41.26.png 1000w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-03-at-14.41.26.png 1600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-03-at-14.41.26.png 1744w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><em>Full disclosure: I'm working on this product, so feel free to lmk if you have any questions!</em> :)</figcaption></figure><h3 id="-sentry">🔍 <a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a></h3><p>Sentry is a monitoring platform that helps with discovering, triaging and prioritizing errors in real time. I didn't use Sentry until recently and previously relied on checking logs inside my EC2 instance (I know, super cumbersome). Sentry was a total gamechanger and here are my reasons why:</p><ul><li><strong>Stack traces:</strong> A stack track shows the stack of functions at the time an uncaught exception is thrown. That way, you can trace your error, with return values and data throughout the process.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2020/11/Untitled.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Untitled.png 600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Untitled.png 1000w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Untitled.png 1600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2020/11/Untitled.png 1819w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><ul><li><strong>Showcasing specific events:</strong> With Sentry, you can investigate specific events and the logs associated with them.</li><li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> I no longer send screenshots, explanations and snippets of errors to collaborators, but rather send a link or assign errors accordingly.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2020/11/Untitled--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Untitled--1-.png 600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Untitled--1-.png 1000w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2020/11/Untitled--1-.png 1065w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Please let me know if you have any questions about these tools (I'm, naturally, an active and satsfied user of them all).

<p>There once was a society in which horizontal totalitarianism was so successful that, without any need for a State or institutions, simple social pressure from friends and neighbours was sufficient to conserve a culture and its customs, perhaps for over forty thousand years. One could even speculate that if Captain James Cook had not disembarked in Australia it may have lasted even longer. The indigenous people of this island-continent are suggestive of the power of horizontal totalitarianism as a form of organisation capable of formatting people so that practically any individual initiative that may alter traditional world-views and customs virtually disappears. Aboriginal Australians did not need to burn at the stake those who broke taboos or refused to respect and follow traditional rites. It was enough that their peers would exclude them from the community, and that they would then perish in the desert (see, for instance, Philip Clarke’s comprehensive anthropological history <em>Where the Ancestors Walked</em>, 2003).</p>



<p>In other societies, more technologically advanced and on the whole ideologically less monolithic, institutional repression has been necessary to eliminate ideologies and behaviours that diverge from horizontal totalitarian norms. In many places, professionalised clergy quickly assumed responsibility for fixing community laws and seeing that they were obeyed, using prosecution analogous to criminal trials against what was considered sinful conduct. These sins were widely understood as crimes against society, or rather, against the maintenance of totalitarian control over individual minds. This is the case, for example, of the ancient Hebrew priesthood, whose sentences were carried out collectively by the people through stoning, a fact that indicated that the punishment was not purely the responsibility of an authority that enforced its will from top to bottom, but also that of the neighbours and acquaintances of the sinner/offender. It was the community that took on and carried out the right to punish. Over time, the State increasingly assumed this power for itself, substituting a vertical order for the earlier horizontal one, which ultimately culminated in modern forms such as fascism and communism. Nowadays, aside from its use by the Cuban dictatorship for its own interests, as well as those who aspire to imitate it in other parts of Spanish-speaking Latin America, horizontal totalitarianism has lost its institutional power in almost all geographical locations and civilizations. This includes Australia, where the aboriginal people, like those of New Guinea, have had to accept modern respect for the individual and the separation, at least in theory, of church, State and ethnicity. However, this does not mean that horizontal totalitarianism is a thing of the ancient past. Even without an established institutional power, its social manifestations continue to oppress people in all too many places, and the modern Western world is no exception. In contrast to the vertical kind, horizontal totalitarianism does not by any means need to dominate public institutions in order to come into being, or to crush the individual, because it pre-dates and exists independently from these institutions.</p>



<p>&nbsp;In fact, horizontal totalitarianism may also arise without availing itself of institutional agency, since it does not require any institutions in order to repress or eliminate dissidents. It is difficult to fight against this type of totalitarianism because anyone could be one of its agents and its workings can remain opaque even to those who enthusiastically practice it in their daily lives. Horizontal totalitarianism represents a totalitarianism exercised by the majority (or a dominant minority able to sway and manipulate a majority) of a given community by oppressing other members of that community who do not adhere to its unwritten rules. It oppresses minorities as well as those who are seen as disturbing or threatening the homogeneity of the community as a unique and complete entity. In horizontal totalitarianism, there is no need for external authorities to impose their will, against whom the community of the oppressed can, in turn, rebel. Since the majority, made up of oppressors and their conformist followers, and the minority of oppressed people live on the same social plane, the persecuted can hardly rely on the solidarity of their fellow dissidents because they find themselves isolated and disempowered among the mass of individuals who apply the unwritten laws of uniformity, and of the totalitarian unity of the community.</p>



<p>It may seem excessive to some to term this horizontal oppression ‘totalitarian’. However, its consequences for people and societies are even more serious than those of vertical totalitarianism. An incalculable number of people have died at the hands of their neighbours and countrymen since the beginning of time. How many Muslim women have been stoned to death by their neighbours for not adhering to their society’s sexual mores? How many Hindu men and women have been murdered by their relatives for daring to marry outside their caste? How many individuals have died for not believing in their tribe’s chosen god? How many have died for daring to question the beliefs and prejudices held by the majority of people in their community? And we are not talking about primitive societies here, nor solely those of the past. Today, homosexual people still commit suicide in communities where widespread homophobia turns their existence into a living hell. We still see people exiled or forced to seek asylum because they refused to partake in the religious or political ideas of their people, or because they do not belong to the predominant ethnicity or ideological affiliation of their region. Criticism, whether more or less open; social vacuums; and the impossibility of leading a life of one’s own, continue to hound all those who, for whatever reason, are seen as being <em>abnormal</em>.</p>



<p>Even our private lives are threatened, and not only by corrupt and opportunistic politicians who take advantage of people’s prejudices to limit minority rights and secure their own power. This power, built on populism, is but the political face of horizontal totalitarianism. Thanks to the development of the surveillance methods and mutual control structures offered by information technologies, before long we might begin to receive scores (c.f. China’s social credit system) and, consequently, punishments and rewards, based on our neighbours’ or communities’ opinions of us. No longer will anyone wish to be original, extravagant or creative, nor outspokenly contrarian, because this may cause that group of people who judge us with each passing moment to turn against us. This phenomenon can be observed in the actions of existing successful public silencing initiatives, which confront questions and divergent opinions with insults, as seen in the unfortunate social media lynchings perpetrated in recent years by fanaticised supporters of MeToo or Black Lives Matter, or by similar movements with equally extreme ideologies. While it is true that these phenomena are not new, in the past they were only dangerous once they crossed into the physical realm, when people became a policing mass, as explained by Gustave Le Bon in <em>The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind </em>(<em>Psychologie des foules </em>1895). Thanks to current technologies and the eternal social instincts of the human being, the ‘mechanical solidarity’ of closed, traditional communities, as described by Émile Durkheim in <em>The Division of Labour in Society </em>(<em>De la division du travail social </em>1893), may even accumulate more repressive force today than it has already enjoyed for millennia.</p>



<p>The Internet has been and continues to be a powerful tool for unleashing self-expression and individual creativity. In theory, anyone can propose anything online, and by the same token, can oppose anything. Then again, it is important to ask oneself how many people might maintain their silence, or hide their convictions for fear of the aforementioned media lynchings. We are also aware of numerous children and adolescents who have committed suicide to escape cyberbullying perpetrated by their neighbours and classmates, for their apparent lack of conformity to some ideal or principle of normalcy prevalent at the time. For horizontal totalitarianism, social harassment is a powerful weapon that the Internet has not deactivated; one could even argue that its power has intensified, since the Internet makes it easy for the number of bullies to increase exponentially.</p>



<p>The danger appears even greater when taking into account that neither writers nor intellectuals wish to denounce it. On the contrary, the modern and postmodern idealisation of all manner of closed societies, from primitive tribes to rural villages, has inspired numerous texts precisely condemning that one place where the individual may, to an extent, escape horizontal totalitarianism. That is, the great modern city in which economic and political freedom prevail, as well as freedom to practice traditional customs. In the city, it is not possible for everyone to know and control you. Unlike the village or tribe, in which everyone knows everyone else, no one has any reason to know anything about you and thus you can carry on your life without fear of criticism or attacks from other members of the community. No one will disapprove of you because you do not attend mass or believe in the God or gods that the village or tribe dictates you should, make love in a way that is condemned by the ruling community’s morality, or fail to profess belief in your nationality being superior to that of foreigners. Aside from mandatory compliance with laws and the reciprocal respect essential to a peaceful coexistence, the individual is sovereign and is no longer a mere component of a mechanical social …</p></div></div>

In the context of machine learning and data science, you might use integrals to calculate area under the curve (for instance, to evaluate performance of a model with the ROC curve, or to calculate probability from densities.</p><p>In this article, you’ll learn about integrals and the area under the curve using the practical data science example of the area under the ROC curve used to compare the performances of two machine learning models. Building from this example, you’ll see the notion of area under the curve and integrals from a mathematical point of view (from my book Essential Math for Data Science).</p><h3 id="practical-project">Practical Project</h3><p>Let’s say that you would like to predict the quality of wines from various of their chemical properties.

The dataset comes from here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality.

For models like logistic regression which outputs probabilities between 0 and 1, you need to convert this score to the class 0 or 1 using a <em>decision threshold</em>, or just <em>threshold</em>. A probability above the threshold is considered as a positive class. For instance, using the default choice of the decision threshold at 0.5, you consider that the estimated class is 1 when the model outputs a score above 0.5.</p><p>However, you can choose other thresholds, and the metrics you use to evaluate the performance of your model will depend on this threshold.</p><p>With the ROC curve, you consider multiple thresholds between 0 and 1 and calculate the true positive rate as a function of the false positive rate for each of them.</p><p>You can use the function <code>roc_curve</code> from Sklearn to calculate the false positive rate (fpr) and the true positive rate (tpr). The function outputs also the corresponding thresholds. Let’s try it with our simulated random model where outputs are only values bellow 0.5 (<code>y_pred_random_proba</code>).</p><div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>sklearn.metrics</span> <span>import</span> <span>roc_curve</span>

<p><em>Ezra Pound, Italy and The Cantos</em>, by Massimo Bacigalupo, Clemson University Press, 346 pp, £64, ISBN: 978-1949979008</p>
<p>Ezra Pound is, perhaps, the most troubling of all the Modernist presences in Anglophone literature – a fascist and an unrepentant antisemite even after the Holocaust revealed the ultimate end of that obnoxious prejudice – yet he was a brilliant poet, a brilliant synthesiser of cultures and absolutely central to Modernism in English. Born in Hailey, Idaho in 1885, he came to Europe in 1908, first to Gibraltar as a tour guide, later to Genoa and then to London, where he lived for ten years. During his stay there he made the acquaintance of all the Modernist poets and was, by the time he left for Paris and Italy, already a significant figure in that literary movement. He arrived in Rapallo, Italy, in 1924 and lived there until 1945, when he was forcibly repatriated to the USA to stand trial for his wartime collaboration with the Italian government. While in London he was a hugely influential editor and critic and his influence would be continued from his base in Italy. His role in the work of Eliot and Yeats, among many others, is well-known, as is his furious proselytising on behalf of James Joyce, who said of him: “It is probable that but for him I should still be the unknown drudge that he discovered.” Eliot, in dedicating “The Waste Land” to Pound, called him <em>il miglior fabbro</em> ‑ the best craftsman (a quotation from Dante).</p>
<p><em>Ezra Pound, Italy and the Cantos</em> comes from the pen of one of the foremost Pound critics. Massimo Bacigalupo grew up in Rapallo, Pound’s long-term home. His parents were friends of Pound’s and Bacigalupo himself would come to know him in what he calls his “complex and tormented final phase” in the postwar period when, as a broken man, he returned to his old ground. Besides literary criticism, Bacigalupo is an accomplished and multi-award-winning short-film-maker (the Turin Film festival dedicated a retrospective to his work in 2010) and many of the photographs included in the text are his; a prize-winning translator of, among others, Pound, Yeats and Wordsworth; and emeritus professor of Anglo-American literature at the University of Genoa. Bacigalupo’s personal relationship with the Pounds informs every aspect of his book and lends a more intimate air to his acute observations. </p>
<p>Had Pound, like Eliot, who was equally antisemitic and had fascist tendencies, confined himself to poetry we might remember him differently but it was his misfortune to fall under the spell of fascism and to be incapable of circumspection. Yeats, who admired the Blueshirts in Ireland, shared Pound’s contempt for democracy – indeed for the <em>demos</em> – his belief in an “aristocracy of the arts” and his contempt for the bourgeoisie. In the chaos that followed the First World War the idea of a political strongman was fatally attractive to many intellectuals. This is the context of Pound’s fascism, though I believe that antisemitism was the real poison in his blood. He correctly argued that “usury”, which we would call “finance capitalism”, would come to dominate Western society but believed it was a Jewish conspiracy and fascism was the cure. Not only does he argue that Jews are usurers but also very often the converse that financiers must be Jews, as in the case of the Scot John Law, who was controller general for France during the reign of Louis XIV. Pound calls him “Lawvi or Levi”, in other words, he guessed wrongly that Law was a cover for the Jewish name Levi – a classic antisemitic inductive error. He has the conspiracy theorist’s eye for detail, as well as his failure to grasp reality.</p>
<p>Pound’s biggest mistake was to make regular broadcasts for the fascist government of Italy during the war. These broadcasts, though never as targeted towards the Axis war effort as those of William Joyce, known as Lord Haw Haw, who was eventually hanged by the British, were nevertheless rightly considered rank propaganda for an enemy power. Pound’s broadcasts mainly consisted of rambling attacks on “usury”, Jews and the United States as well as samples of his own poetry, but they were monitored in the USA and considered to be aimed at undermining morale. In 1943, he was indicted for treason <em>in absentia</em>. On capture he was detained in a “cage” in Pisa for some time and then repatriated to stand trial. Because of the influence of his friends he did not receive the death sentence but was committed to St Elizabeth’s Psychiatric Hospital near Washington, where he remained for thirteen years.</p>
<p>Bacigalupo does not shy away from what he calls “the Pound vortex”, which, he says, “must be acknowledged in all its bewildering violence and historical dimensions”. Strangely, it is the Italian writers of the postwar Left who were most forgiving of his wartime stance. Pier Paolo Pasolini, for example, perhaps the most ferocious of antifascist writers and <em>auteurs</em>, was an admirer and there is a brief account here of a gentle and supportive interview he conducted with the poet in his final years. Carlo Izzo was another – scholar and translator <em>extraordinaire</em> of among many others Liam O’Flaherty – Pound referred to him as “my best translator”. Remarkably, considering that Izzo was a communist and a committed antifascist who married a Jewish woman and whose position at the University of Bologna was cancelled under Mussolini’s Race Law, the two men continued to correspond throughout the war years. In 1958, Izzo wrote sadly of Pound:</p>
<p>That he could have identified his world-view with that horror of doctrines that are among the most inhuman of all time, does suggest mental aberration. To say to an Italian Jew, on the day that Italy passed the racial laws that are so alien to the spirit of our civilisation: ‘I am sorry, but it is well done,’ is the act of someone not in his right mind. Six million of those ‘I am sorry’ wouldn’t have saved one of the six million innocents who were ‘Liquidated’. I remember this incident without rancour …</p>
<p>Elsewhere he remarks, having listed Pound’s greetings to Venetian writers, several of whom were Jewish, that “Pound’s antisemitism was almost ludicrously theoretical”. In a valedictory piece after Pound’s death, Izzo wrote revealingly of their correspondence: “I cannot say that I ever had with Pound a real human relationship, since he was so remote from reality, and conversed in fragments, sometimes somewhat childishly.” The latter, I suspect, is a reference to the strange pastiche of Pound’s letter-writing, full of jokey attempts at demotic accents like Dickens on a bad day, and verbal ticks and wordplays and a random mix of languages. But, at the same time he wrote that “Pound was essentially … <em>il miglior fabbro</em>”,<em> </em>echoing Eliot’s “Waste Land” dedication.</p>
<p>Another Italian writer who admired and worked with Pound was Eugenio Montale, a Nobel Prize winner, born in Genoa. He lived a considerable part of his life just down the road from Rapallo at Monterosso in the Cinque Terre. But Montale did not follow him in his admiration for Mussolini nor his antisemitism (he was antifascist, had a Jewish lover and had many Jewish friends). Montale was an acute reader of poetry in English and grasped the beauty of Pound’s work. Bacigalupo devotes a chapter to the relationship. </p>
<p>Of the later <em>Cantos</em>, Montale wrote that they contained “a flood of haikus, that, should most of the poem be destroyed, would be the marvel of posterity”, but equally he could say, in an article on Pound’s release from St Elizabeth’s Hospital that Pound was “generous in helping the young of his generation, yet remained indifferent to the misery of a mass of innocents herded to the worst of deaths in the gas chambers”. He was amused by Pound’s lack of knowledge of the works he championed and translated, in particular his translation of Cavalcanti, which met widespread criticism. He understood too, that Pound collected bright objects from literature and history, polished them and placed them in contrapuntal dialogue, a form of homage to the original, but he did not necessarily understand the objects he selected. Pound’s Italian was not perfect and he knew almost nothing of the Oriental languages from which he “translated”; nevertheless, he often achieved an intense engagement with the poets which a better linguist might not have achieved. Bacigalupo maintains convincingly that though Pound had a profound influence upon Montale, turning him from the more conventional lyricism of his 1925 collection <em>Ossi di Seppia</em> (Cuttlefish Bones) to the more modernist 1939 volume <em>Le Occasioni</em> (The Occasions).</p>
<p>One of the delights of this study is what we might call the topographical analysis. The book falls fairly neatly into two parts – studies of the <em>Cantos</em> in relation to places and people, a sort of Baedeker to Pound’s inner geography, fittingly when we consider how Pound took Italy as the touchstone for the world. It is not so much that Pound is an Italophile, but that he saw the world by looking out from Italy, a world with Italy in the foreground. Montale himself noted Pound’s Italocentric <em>weltanschauung</em>: “Only in Rapallo, which he called ‘the world’s navel’ did he feel at home … He needed Italian pretexts.” Thus, the book begins and ends at the place closest to Pound’s ‑ and Bacigalupo’s – heart, the city and environs of Rapallo on the northwest Riviera coast of Italy, having strayed, in the meantime, to Venice and Rome and onwards. </p>
<p>Bacigalupo’s intimacy with the landscape in which the <em>Cantos</em> were composed is a delight. At the outset, he takes us on a walk from Pound’s seafront attic in Via Marsala to the village of Sant’Ambrogio on the slopes of Montallegro, following Pound’s daily itinerary from his home and wife (Dorothy Shakespear) to his lover Olga Rudge. From the attic he sees the sandboats run up on the beach at Rapallo: “the boats’ sails hung loose at the mooring, / cloud like a sail inverted / and the men dumping sand by the sea-wall”. On another occasion …</p></div></div>

                <p>Facebook’s ‘Libra’ digital currency project combined incompetence and arrogance and was bound to fail, says David Gerard, our guest on the latest <em>New Money Review</em> podcast.</p>
<p>Gerard, a technology expert and journalist, is the author of a new book, called ‘<a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/about/">Libra Shrugged</a>’, on what he sees as Facebook’s attempts to take over the world’s money.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://newmoneyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DG.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="321" srcset="https://newmoneyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DG.jpg 900w, https://newmoneyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DG-225x300.jpg 225w, https://newmoneyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DG-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px"></p>
<p><em>David Gerard</em></p>
<p>In June last year, <a href="https://newmoneyreview.com/index.php/2019/06/18/zuckerberg-launches-his-global-currency-project/">Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced his firm’s ambitions to provide the first global medium of exchange</a>, for use across the firm’s social media channels, which include Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram and reach over 2bn global users.</p>
<p>According to Gerard, Facebook’s bid to launch a private currency was motivated by its desire to collect even more of our personal data.</p>
<p>And if regulators hadn’t prevented the launch of Libra, says Gerard, the US technology firm would have obtained an almost impregnable competitive advantage, he argues.</p>
<blockquote><p>Libra combined incompetence and arrogance and was bound to fail</p></blockquote>
<p>“If you think Facebook is hard to regulate now — just think how hard Facebook would be to regulate if it controlled not just the money, but your access to financial services outside Facebook,” he writes in his new book.</p>
<p>According to Gerard, Facebook seriously misjudged the complexity of the regulations governing the world’s financial system. The firm apparently thought it could just launch a new global digital currency on the basis of a good idea, he says during the podcast.</p>
<p>While the tech giant is likely to continue in its payments push, says Gerard, it will have to do so with vastly reduced ambitions. Facebook <a href="https://newmoneyreview.com/index.php/2020/04/16/facebooks-libra-goes-for-single-currency-stablecoins/">has already been forced to abandon its plans for a single global currency unit</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin is an ‘apocalyptic death cult’</p></blockquote>
<p>In the podcast, Gerard also explains his long-standing dislike of cryptocurrency, calling bitcoin an ‘apocalyptic death cult’.</p>
<p>While the cryptography supporting bitcoin is sound, he says, the 12-year-old digital currency—and its many spin-offs—have attracted serial scammers, who keep preying on gullible members of the public.</p>
<p>During the interview, Gerard goes on to express scepticism about <a href="https://newmoneyreview.com/index.php/2020/08/27/will-digital-cash-be-private/">the current race to introduce central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://newmoneyreview.com/index.php/2020/11/04/digitalisation-of-payments-accelerates/">As payments become increasingly digital</a>, CBDCs could replace national banknotes and coins.</p>
<p>But most of these new digital moneys are a solution in search of a problem, argues Gerard, and are unlikely to take off.</p>

<h3>Seasonal.css: Give your website a seasonal colour scheme</h3>
<p><i>Fri  6 November 2020</i></p>
<p><i>Tagged: <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/tags/software.html">software</a></i></p>
<p>I've been working on a project that gives a CSS colour scheme that varies based on the day of the year, with a vague attempt
to match the colour to the season. In case you're wondering why my blog has a new purple colour scheme (at time of writing):
this is why. Have another look tomorrow if you want to see the same content in an imperceptibly-different purple.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://seasonal-css.incoherency.co.uk/">Seasonal.css project homepage</a>
or see the <a href="https://github.com/jes/seasonal-css">README on github</a>.</p>
<p>If you want, you can use it on your own pages:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://seasonal-css.incoherency.co.uk/seasonal.css"&gt;</code></pre>
<h2>What?</h2>
<p>Seasonal.css gives you a different colour scheme every day. Each day is only marginally different from the day before, but over the course
of the year, the entire range of the colour wheel is visited. Autumn has orange-purple colours, winter has purple-blue, spring has
blue-green, and summer has yellow-orange.</p>
<p>This animation shows the colour scheme on this blog throughout the year, at 30-day intervals:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/3027"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/3027"></a></p>
<p>This is accomplished by having Seasonal.css write the day's colours into <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS
variables</a> which can then be used to style the page.</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>From the README:</p>
<blockquote>One morning, while looking out of my window at the autumnal leaves on the trees, I thought to myself "my, what beautiful colours, I wish I could have these on my website". The idea fermented for a little while and I eventually realised that it would be possible for the colours of the website to change to match the colours of the seasons.
<p>
I enjoy how the colours of the natural world change throughout the year and wanted to bring the same experience to the web.</p></blockquote>
<h2>How?</h2>
<p>My initial idea was to manually define a colour scheme for each of the 4 seasons, and then interpolate between them with a few sine waves to generate
the colour scheme for each day. This did not work very well at all, because I had no understanding of colour theory. For example, the background
colour of one season had no relationship to the background colour of the next season (different saturation, brightness, etc.) because each colour
scheme was picked in isolation. This meant that interpolating between them resulted in nonsensical colour schemes.</p>
<p>A friend then linked me to Rob Weychert's <a href="https://v6.robweychert.com/blog/2019/12/dynamic-color-javascript-hsl/">dynamic, date-based colour</a>
project. (Rob also has a great post on <a href="https://v6.robweychert.com/blog/2018/02/v6-color/">colour theory</a> which is worth reading.)</p>
<p>Rob's approach was to split the HSL colour wheel up so that the first of each month takes a position on the colour wheel, and then linearly interpolate hues using
the colour wheel. Then define background, foreground, etc. saturation and lightness independently of the hue, so that they remain consistent throughout
the year. This works much better.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with Seasonal.css is that the colours from about mid-June to the end of July are a kind of muddy brown instead
of a bright summery yellow. The reason I have done this is that bright yellow doesn't give very good contrast against a light background, but the muddy
brown doesn't really convey "summer" very well. I'm interested in improvements to the colour scheme.</p>
<p>Seasonal.css is written in JavaScript, for the marginal benefit of being able to run the same code on the client as on the server.
I have used this on the project homepage to provide the live preview of the colour scheme for each day when you drag the slider.</p>
<p>To prevent the browser from caching yesterday's colour scheme, it sends headers:</p>
<pre><code>Expires: 0
Cache-Control: no-cache
</code></pre>
<p>That's not a proper date in the <tt>Expires</tt> header, but RFC2616 section 14.21 says:</p>
<blockquote>HTTP/1.1 clients and caches MUST treat other invalid date formats, especially including the value "0", as in the past (i.e., "already expired"). </blockquote>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I'm pretty pleased with the end result, but I expect it would be a lot better if it were designed by someone with actual design
experience. If you think you can help please get in touch!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!--## Ultra Secure Password Storage with NitroPepper -->
<p>Nitro Enclaves provide isolated compute environments for secure processing of very sensitive data. In this article we will use Nitro Enclaves to build an extremely safe password storage mechanism.</p>
<p>Something was bugging me after publishing my recent articles about EC2 Nitro Enclaves (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sentiatechblog.com/acm-for-nitro-enclaves-its-a-big-deal">part 1</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sentiatechblog.com/acm-for-nitro-enclaves-how-secure-are-they">part 2</a>). It took me a few days until I realized what it was: aside from the ACM reference architecture I couldn’t come up with a valid use case for Nitro Enclaves. This left me wondering - are Nitro Enclaves a solution in search of a problem?</p>
<p>A couple of hours of sketching and thinking left me with a few infeasible or convoluted implementation ideas. But then it hit me. Nitro Enclaves can be used to provide a super secure password storage mechanism. At the end of this post we will have built a Nitro Enclave application that will protect user passwords, even when an attacker has full control over the application server and database. This Nitro Enclave application is called NitroPepper.</p>
<p><strong>[Update November 7th, 2020]</strong> An earlier version of this post used PBKDF2. That received some fair comments on <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25010709">Hacker News</a>. PBKDF2 has now been replaced with bcrypt. The pull request for this replacement can be found <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/donkersgoed/nitropepper-enclave-app/pull/1/files">here</a>.</p>
<p>This article consists of three sections. Section 1 covers password storage mechanisms and explains the problem solved by NitroPepper. Section 2 covers the implementation details of NitroPepper. In section 3 we will walk through all the steps to get NitroPepper running on your own EC2 instances.</p>
<p>The NitroPepper architecture requires a few components, all of which we will discuss in depth in section 2. The components we use are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple Python <strong>Flask frontend</strong> (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/donkersgoed/nitropepper-demo-webapp">GitHub</a>) exposing two REST API methods: <code>new_user</code> and <code>login</code>. This frontend only serves demo purposes.</li>
<li>The <strong>NitroPepper application</strong> (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/donkersgoed/nitropepper-enclave-app">GitHub</a>), written in Python, running in the Nitro Enclave.</li>
<li>The AWS <strong>Nitro Enclaves NSM API</strong>, extended with Python interfaces (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/donkersgoed/aws-nitro-enclaves-nsm-api">GitHub</a>). This API provides an interface between NitroPepper and the Nitro Security Module (NSM).</li>
<li>A <strong>traffic forwarder</strong> to send KMS traffic from NitroPepper to KMS.</li>
<li>A <strong>KMS Proxy</strong> to send KMS traffic from the parent EC2 instance to KMS.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Section 1: a brief history of password storage</h3>
<p>Any system with a user login requires some way to store a user’s password. Decades ago, it was acceptable to store passwords in plain text. But as more and more valuable data was stored online, people started attacking databases and extracting their contents. To protect against password leaks, gradually more sophisticated methods for storing passwords were developed. In this section we will briefly go trough the history of password storage.</p>
<p>If you’re already familiar with hashing algorithms, salt and pepper, feel free to skip this section and jump to the paragraph “The case for a unique pepper per user”.</p>
<p>One caveat: in the sections below I use MD5 as an example hashing mechanism. MD5 is known to be very insecure and you should never use it for real world password hashing. Instead, you would use SHA-512, SHA3 or another highly secure algorithm. The reason I use MD5 in this article is because its output is nice and short, which makes for easier reading.</p>
<h4>The olden days: plain text</h4>
<p>In an almost forgotten past, applications were not connected to the internet, databases were never attacked and passwords could be stored in plain text. A few rows in a user table might look like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>ID</th>
<th>Username</th>
<th>Password</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:alice@example.net">alice@example.net</a></td>
<td>super_Secret1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:bob@example.net">bob@example.net</a></td>
<td>can’t_gues5_This</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br>To log in to this system, the user provides their username and password to the application. The application checks if the username/password combination exists in the database. If the combination is found, the user is allowed in.</p>
<p>As systems got more connected and accessible, database hacks and dumps also became more common. When an attacker would gain access to a database with passwords stored in plain text, they could use this information to log in as any user. To make matters worse, users commonly reuse passwords. This means that an attacker could use the passwords found at insecure site A to try a log in on another site B, even if this site did securely store their passwords.</p>
<h4>Replacing plain text passwords with hashes</h4>
<p>The first development to improve password storage security was <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">hashing</a>. A hashing algorithm like MD5 or SHA takes an input (in our case, the password) and generates a fixed-length string for this input. The algorithm is a mathematical operation that will always generate the same output for any given input. For example:</p>
<pre><code>MD5(super_Secret1) -&gt; bd2bf17a10bc97a50bfb551aa2de9e76
MD5(can't_gues5_This) -&gt; fda5a58b6772c04ea8e0aa6d0767d880
</code></pre>
<p>The essence of a hash function is that it is one-directional. In other words, you can generate a hash from a password, but not a password from its hash. So if someone would gain access to the hash <code>bd2bf17a10bc97a50bfb551aa2de9e76</code>, they wouldn’t know that the source password was <code>super_Secret1</code>.</p>
<p>An application built around this technology would no longer store plain text passwords, but store the hashed version instead:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>ID</th>
<th>Username</th>
<th>PasswordHash</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:alice@example.net">alice@example.net</a></td>
<td>bd2bf17a10bc97a50bfb551aa2de9e76</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:bob@example.net">bob@example.net</a></td>
<td>fda5a58b6772c04ea8e0aa6d0767d880</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br>When a user logs in to this application they provide their username and plain text password. The application hashes the password at every login attempt and compares the result with the hash stored in the database. If they match, the user is allowed in.</p>
<p>With this solution the password is no longer stored in plain text. However, there are still significant weaknesses. The first is that some algorithms, like MD5 and SHA1, have been ‘broken’. When an algorithm has been broken, an attacker can independently generate an input string that results in the given hash. They can then use this input string as the password. Another problem is that the hash value will always be the same for a given password. An attacker can use this fact to build dictionaries or rainbow tables with the hash of common inputs and patterns. When they gain access to a database of hashes they only need to look them up in their dictionary to determine the original password.</p>
<h4>Adding salt to hashes</h4>
<p>The next generation of password security solves the problems of hashing by adding a <em>salt</em>. Why is this called a salt? Because salt goes well with hash. With <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)">salt</a>, we still use a hashing algorithm, but instead of just hashing the plain password, we add a random string to the input. A few quick examples:</p>
<pre><code>MD5(super_Secret1-123455) -&gt; 8b7478c3ba06d3c5ed56754094ba5cd3
MD5(super_Secret1-669911) -&gt; c9037f7af3e52966f4766074b17c0b8c
MD5(can't_gues5_This-998765) -&gt; 337ef055ed6d3efd9d8d31a58d55bfab
</code></pre>
<p>This salt is stored with the user information in the database. Please note that a salt would in reality be a longer string with a larger character set.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>ID</th>
<th>Username</th>
<th>PasswordHash</th>
<th>PasswordSalt</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:alice@example.net">alice@example.net</a></td>
<td>bd2bf17a10bc97a50bfb551aa2de9e76</td>
<td>123455</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:bob@example.net">bob@example.net</a></td>
<td>fda5a58b6772c04ea8e0aa6d0767d880</td>
<td>998765</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br>With a salt added to the password, two identical passwords (<code>super_Secret1</code>) become unique (<code>super_Secret1-123455</code> and <code>super_Secret1-669911</code>), which results in different hashes.</p>
<p>When logging in to this system, the user still provides their plain text password. The server then retrieves the salt from the database and performs the hash function: <code>MD5([password]-[salt])</code>. When the resulting hash matches the stored password hash, the user is allowed to log in.</p>
<p>With salt added to hashes, dictionaries and rainbow tables have become useless. Unfortunately, even this solution is not strong enough in a number of use cases.</p>
<h4>Adding a shared secret pepper</h4>
<p>In the solution above all information is stored in a single source - the database. If the attacker has access to the database and a known entry (for example their own username and password), they can attempt to retrieve the original values through brute force. This might take a while, but processing power becomes cheaper every year, and governments have access to supercomputers that might make breaking passwords easier than you might expect.</p>
<p>To be fair, a storage mechanism with properly salted passwords will be more than secure enough for most applications. But in healthcare, finance or government use cases, it might not be sufficient. This is where adding a server based pepper comes into play. Why is it called a pepper…? Well you get the point.</p>
<p>A shared secret pepper builds on the principle of the salt, but instead of storing the value in the database, it is stored on the server file system or another non-database system like AWS Secrets Manager. To be able to decrypt the passwords in the database the attacker needs access to both the database and secondary storage system, which significantly improves security. A simple SQL injection attack or access to a database backup is now no longer sufficient to attempt a brute force attack.</p>
<p>This time when a user attempts to log in, the application will hash the password + salt + pepper: <code>MD5([password]-[salt]-[pepper])</code>. When the result matches the password hash stored in the database, the user is allowed in.</p>
<h4>The case for a unique pepper per user</h4>
<p>The Wikipedia page for <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_(cryptography)">Pepper (cryptography)</a> states: “In the case of a shared-secret pepper, a single compromised password (via password reuse or other attack) along with a user’s salt can lead to an attack to discover the pepper, rendering it ineffective”. Additionally, a user, engineer or hacker  with access to a web server will likely have access to the database credentials and the shared secret pepper. If this person could exfiltrate the database and the shared secret pepper, the passwords can be brute-forced again.</p>
<p>The solution is to generate a pepper unique to every user. Of course, the salt is also unique to each user. The difference between the user salt and the unique user pepper is where they are stored. The salt is stored semi-publicly with the user’s hashed password, while the unique user pepper is stored on a separate medium, such as a Hardware Security Module (HSM). The …</p></div></div>

<p>This week, as an addendum to our four(and a half)-part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/18/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-mining/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/25/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-trees-for-blooms/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/02/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iii-hammer-time/">III</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/09/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iva-steel-yourself/">IVa</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/16/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ivb-work-hardening-or-hardly-working/">IVb</a>) look at pre-modern iron and steel production, we’re going to look at two alternative regional processes, where they fit into the entire iron production process that we detailed already, how they worked and what kind of product they produced.  In particular, we are going to look at the early production of cast iron in China, and the production of a form of crucible steel, called <em>wootz</em>, in India (and South Asia more broadly).</p>



<p>First, some necessary caveats.  Neither of these methods of iron production were practiced in my core area of research (the greater Mediterranean world during the Hellenistic and Roman periods), although <em>wootz</em> steel was imported in small quantities during that time and a handful of cast iron goods produced in China also made it to the broader Roman or Hellenistic world (though very, <em>very</em> few).  Consequently my knowledge here is much thinner and I am much more reliant on reporting the work of other scholars.  Moreover, some of the scholarship on these topics is in languages I do not read, so I am also reliant on other scholars for that.  As such, this is going to be a much more general discussion of these processes and I am going to be a bit more cautious about what I say about them.  At the same time, I simply don’t have the information to talk much about the details of the lives of the iron-workers here themselves, like I could in the previous posts, so this will mostly focus on process and product, rather than people.</p>



<p>That said, I thought this was still worth doing because it seems like there is quite a bit of unhelpful ‘mystique’ surrounding both.  On the one hand, a lot of the discussion of the production of cast iron in China fails to really put the innovation both in the correct spot in the iron production process but also in the correct context in terms of the development of iron-working technology.  On the other hand, much of the popular discussion about <em>wootz</em> steel in India treats it as this quasi-legendary ‘lost’ and mysterious production process when it is, in fact, a fairly well understood method of producing high-quality steel.</p>



<p>And of course, as always, if you want to support my essay production process, you can do so via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a> and by sharing to my work to a wider audience (but please do not copy-and-repost these essays; link to them instead).  And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings (and I promise fewer political musings now that the electoral<em> <em>götterdämmerung</em></em> has come and – heavens I hope by the time this post goes live – gone).</p>






<p>(Subsequent edit: Due to some election-related trolling coming from off-site, I had to prune back the comments to the original topic.  Apologies for those whose comments were pruned (except the troll) but I wanted to keep us on topic and away from the abyss of endless political carping.)</p>



<h2>Cast Iron in China</h2>



<p>Now I’ve stated several times during this series that generally speaking the bloomeries used to smelt iron in the pre-modern period were not capable of reaching the high temperatures (1538 °C) required to actually melt iron and instead produced pure metallic iron through solid state reduction (that is, the bloomery process) along with, essentially, melting everything that <em>wasn’t</em> iron out of the bloom.  And for most of the world in most of the pre-modern period, this is true.</p>



<p><strong>China appears to be the odd exception</strong>.  I should note that this is an area of scholarship that is still quite active – dates are still in flux (shifting back as new discoveries push back the earliest dates) and the exact nature of the transitions from bronze-working to iron-working in China and the degree to which the bloomery processes we’ve discussed served as an intermediate stage is still debated, as far as I know.  A fair bit of the discussion of the question is, unsurprisingly, in Chinese, which I cannot read.  So I am doing my best to provide a summary of what I know.</p>

<p>Cast iron in China seems to become widespread during the Warring States period (453-221), though the technology itself probably had its genesis in the earlier Spring and Autumn period (770-454) and it becomes truly ubiquitous during the early Qin-Han Period (221 BC – 220 AD).  The general working hypothesis based on the evidence is that the cast iron product emerged not out of bloomery iron production (which seems to have been used in China side-by-side with cast iron production for the first couple of centuries) but instead out of the furnace techniques already in use for casting objects in copper-alloy (read: bronze), until the cast iron process became able to produce a high enough quality iron product that it supplanted bloomery production, probably in the last century BC. Again, those dates are very approximate and seem to me to still be significantly unsettled, going by the range I’ve seen in scholarship (the most recent I could find on this was “Everything Old is new Again?  Rethinking the Transition to Cast Iron production in the Central Plains of China” in <em>Journal of Anthropological Research</em> (2014), so those are the dates I have gone with; Craddock and Tylecote both have somewhat later dates).</p>



<p>The basic interaction of producing cast iron centers around one oddity in carbon-iron alloys: <strong>as you add more carbon to iron, the melting point of the resulting mixture drops</strong>.  At 4.3% carbon content, the melting point of iron drops to just 1150 °C, which <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/25/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-trees-for-blooms/">as you will recall</a>, is very much within reach for pre-modern furnaces worked by bellows (and China seems to have generally had better, hotter furnaces than contemporary pre-modern Europe to boot).  Adding small amounts of either sulfur (typically from coal being used to supply the carbon) or phosphorous can lower the melting point further, although these can also make the metal brittle.  At that point, large, bellows-fed furnaces can heat the iron-carbon mixture up to the point where it melts and becomes sufficiently fluid to cast (slag and other impurities, being lighter, can be drawn out with a flux and tapped off).  <strong>The result is cast iron</strong> (also called ‘pig iron’).</p>



<p>The <em>problem</em>, as we’ve discussed earlier, <strong>is that cast iron</strong> (which, to be clear, iron produced this way is still cast iron, even if you aren’t pouring it into a model; it is a type of iron as will become plain) <strong>comes out of the process with unfavorable characteristics</strong>, particularly in strength, brittleness and malleability – <strong>in short, it is too hard, too weak, and too prone to break and crack rather than bend</strong>.  The carbon content of cast iron is, of course, very high: above 4%, the carbon makes the iron much too hard and inflexible, causing it to become extremely brittle.  In particular, if the silicon content (which is likely to come from bits of slag melting and dissolving into the iron at the high temperatures) is low and the iron is cooled fairly quickly, it forms into cementite, which is hard and brittle.  Cementite isn’t bad in and of itself – <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/16/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ivb-work-hardening-or-hardly-working/">we saw this with heat-treated steel</a>, where just a bit of cementite among the ferrite offered improved strength and hardness.  But this is not just a little cementite, it is <em>lots of cementite</em>.  In excess of 60% cementite, what is sometimes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_iron#White_cast_iron">‘white’ cast iron</a>.  <strong>At these levels, the amount of cementite leaves the cast iron very hard and very brittle, likely to break</strong> <strong>and actually difficult to cast effectively</strong> (because it is likely to crack from thermal stresses as it cools).</p>

Using mechanical assistance like this would have made the furnace operation significantly more labor efficient.</figcaption></figure>



<p>More slowly cooled cast iron with high silicon content, can come as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_iron#Grey_cast_iron">‘grey’ cast iron</a>, which has less cementite, but has instead pockets of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphite"><em>graphite</em> </a>– little pockets of cure crystalline carbon which couldn’t be absorbed into the iron – which have very little strength and essentially functions as cracks within the iron, reducing the overall toughness considerably.  Craddock notes that early Chinese cast iron tends to be grey cast iron, but – curiously – with somewhat lower silicon contents than we’d expect for grey cast iron.  So for almost any tool or weapon use, our cast iron is functionally worthless: too brittle to sustain meaningful stress.  <strong>But we’re not done.</strong></p>



<p><strong>The key technique that Chinese ironworkers seemed to have developed here is <em>malleablisation</em>.</strong>  By heating the iron to melting temperatures (or just below) in an oxidizing environment (which is to say, open to the air) the ironworker can cause a few things to happen.  First, the oxidation process begins to draw off the carbon from the iron (again, you will remember the tendency of heat and air to decarburize iron from<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/09/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iva-steel-yourself/"> our discussion of making steel</a>).  At the same time, the graphite which originally was in long, thin flakes begins to form into more compact round shapes which cause less strain on the metal (there is also just <em>less</em> of that graphite, because it is made of the carbon that the air is drawing off in the decarburization process).  If the iron is kept hot and open to the air long enough, it can either be decarburized to steel or even all of the way to wrought iron, making it usable for tools, weapons, armor and the like.</p>



<p>(I should note that somewhat different processes for removing carbon to make cast iron workable as wrought iron, called <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finery_forge">fining</a></strong>, emerged in late medieval Europe.  This was done at a finery forge (we start to see these as early as the 13th century AD in Europe and involving breaking cast iron into smaller chunks and then heating …</p></div></div>

</ol>


<p>In <a href="https://blog.kdubovikov.ml/articles/rust/building-a-weather-station-bot">the previous post</a> we have built a weather station bot that can notify us about new measurements made by our weather station. Today, we are going to build a simple REST API to fetch the data from our server and draw a chart on a simple dashboard.</p>


<p>Our web interface will need historical data that will be displayed in the charts. Before building an actual UI we will create a REST API that will return all sensor readings that are stored in our database. The code for the API is located in the <a href="https://github.com/kdubovikov/weather-station-bot/blob/master/src/bin/weather_station_api.rs"><code>weather_station_api.rs</code></a> file. We will use the <a href="https://docs.rs/tower-web/0.3.7/tower_web/">tower_web</a> crate to create a service that will return all sensor measurements along with their timestamps. We already have the database related code covered in the previous post. The entire service code is very concise:</p>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After that all we need is to run the server somewhere inside our <code>main</code> function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>cors</span> <span>=</span> <span>CorsBuilder</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()</span>
        <span>.allow_origins</span><span>(</span><span>AllowedOrigins</span><span>::</span><span>Any</span> <span>{</span> <span>allow_null</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span> <span>}</span> <span>)</span>
        <span>.build</span><span>();</span>

<span>ServiceBuilder</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()</span>
    <span>.resource</span><span>(</span><span>WeatherApi</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.middleware</span><span>(</span><span>cors</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.run</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>addr</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can check that the API works as intended by running the server and issuing an HTTP GET request with <code>curl</code> or <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a>.</p>


<p>Now, let’s create a simple UI Dashboard. The purpose of our interface will be to display a historical plot of temperature, humidity and pressure readings from our weather station. We won’t use any complex javascript frameworks and stick to vanilla javascript. This is how the final result will look like:</p>

<h2 id="markup">Markup</h2>
<p>For a start, let’s look at <code>index.html</code>:</p>

<h2 id="ui-logic">UI logic</h2>
<p>Having finished with the markup we now can transition to making our dashboard to be useful by implementing some logic in the <code>index.js</code> script. As a headstart, let’s start from the top abstraction level and look what the code does in overall:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>API_URL</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>http://localhost:8080</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that we have seen the whole picture, let’s look at how the individual functions work. We will start with <code>createChart</code>, that uses our canvas to display a plot using chart.js library:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/**

                <span>}]</span>
            <span>}</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>});</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>chart</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, let’s look at how we can prepare data to be rendered by chart.js uring <code>createChartDataset</code> function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/**
 * Transforms API response into an object that can be used in the {@link updateChart} call. 
 * @param {Object} data 
 * @param {string} selector 
 */</span>
<span>function</span> <span>createChartDataset</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>,</span> <span>selector</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>series</span> <span>=</span> <span>data</span><span>.</span><span>messages</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>item</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>item</span><span>[</span><span>selector</span><span>]);</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>'</span><span>dates</span><span>'</span><span>:</span> <span>data</span><span>.</span><span>messages</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>item</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>item</span><span>.</span><span>timestamp</span><span>),</span>
        <span>'</span><span>data</span><span>'</span><span>:</span> <span>series</span><span>,</span>
        <span>'</span><span>min</span><span>'</span><span>:</span> <span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>min</span><span>.</span><span>apply</span><span>(</span><span>series</span><span>),</span>

    <span>};</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, let’s look at how to update the existing chart’s data:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/**
 * Updates given chart using data and sets y axis min and max values 
 * @param {ChartJS object} chart 
 * @param {Object} data

 */</span>
<span>function</span> <span>updateChart</span><span>(</span><span>chart</span><span>,</span> <span>data</span><span>,</span> <span>min</span><span>,</span> <span>max</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>chart</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>datasets</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>].</span><span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>data</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>;</span>

    <span>chart</span><span>.</span><span>options</span><span>.</span><span>scales</span><span>.</span><span>yAxes</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>].</span><span>ticks</span><span>.</span><span>suggestedMin</span> <span>=</span> <span>min</span><span>;</span>
    <span>chart</span><span>.</span><span>options</span><span>.</span><span>scales</span><span>.</span><span>yAxes</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>].</span><span>ticks</span><span>.</span><span>suggestedMax</span> <span>=</span> <span>max</span><span>;</span>
    <span>chart</span><span>.</span><span>update</span><span>();</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is everything that we neet to fetch and render our weather station measurements using an API. Now, let’s switch to the styling part and make things look a bit prettier.</p>

<h2 id="styling">Styling</h2>

<p>In this project, we will use <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> extension language as a handy abstraction upon regular CSS. It allows to write stylesheets in a more clean and readable manner. I won’t do a detailed walkthrough of the stylesheet and encourage you to clone the repository, open the <code>index.html</code> file in the browser and play with the styles yourself. Page styling and design are better to be learned in practice: install <code>sass</code>, read documentation and experiment.</p>



<p>By this post, we conclude the journey that led us from building ESP32 based weather station hardware, writing firmware, coding the backend service that tracks all measurements, building a Telegram notification bot and creating a simple web dashboard …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>This is a short summary of my experience while writing a <strong>simple HackerNews scraper</strong>.</p><p>As a pure <em>exercise or kata</em> if you want, I tried to apply <em>Clean code, Refactoring and Testing priciples</em> for this small <strong>npm module</strong>.</p><p>The task is simple:</p><p>Get the posts on the front page of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">https://news.ycombinator.com</a> and parse them.</p><hr><p>Table of contents</p><ul><li><a href="#npm-setup">npm setup</a></li><li><a href="#install-test-dependencies">Install test dependencies</a></li><li><a href="#the-first-test-fetching-the-html">The first test: Fetching the HTML</a><ul><li><a href="#create-indextestjs">Create <code>index.test.js</code></a></li><li><a href="#first-assertion">First assertion</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#parsing">Parsing</a><ul><li><a href="#html-of-hackernews">HTML of HackerNews</a></li><li><a href="#second-test-parsing-html-to-hackernews-item">Second test: Parsing HTML to HackerNews item</a></li><li><a href="#parsing-the-html">Parsing the HTML</a></li><li><a href="#extracing-more-data">Extracing more data</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#refactoring-parsenews">Refactoring <code>parseNews</code></a></li><li><a href="#combining-parsing-and-fetching">Combining Parsing and Fetching</a></li></ul><p>Start with a <code>npm init -y</code> in a clean repository. You can create the repo beforehand and then initialise it with <code>npm</code>.</p><p>This creates a <code>package.json</code> file that resembles your npm package.</p><p>I would start with <code>ava</code> as test-runner and assertion library.</p><p><code>npm i --save-dev ava</code></p><p>Add the following <code>test</code> script to the <code>scripts</code> section of your <code>package.json</code>:</p><pre><code>  "scripts": {
    "test": "ava",
    ...
</code></pre><p>As a first test, I would verify that I can successfully get the HTML of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">https://news.ycombinator.com</a>.</p><p>Let's try.</p><h2>Create <code>index.test.js</code></h2><p>Create a file called <code>index.test.js</code> and start by including <code>ava</code>:</p><pre><code>const test = require('ava')
</code></pre><p>The first test could look something like this:</p><pre><code>test('gets html from https://news.ycombinator.com/', async t =&gt; {
  ...
})
</code></pre><h2>First assertion</h2><p>Let's assert/verify that our code is able to get the html</p><pre><code>test('gets html from https://news.ycombinator.com/', async t =&gt; {
  const html = await getHTML()
  t.true(typeof html === 'string')
  t.true(html.startsWith('&lt;html '))
})
</code></pre><p>Now we need <code>getHTML</code>. I like using <code>got</code> for making simple HTTP requests.</p><p>Install it with <code>npm i got</code></p><pre><code>const got = require('got')
async function getHTML () {
  return got('https://news.ycombinator.com')
    .then(res =&gt; res.body)
}
</code></pre><p>Now we have <code>getHTML</code> that returns the markup for news.ycombinator.com</p><p>Let's parse it!</p><h2>HTML of HackerNews</h2><p>Taking a look at the source of HackerNews, the page has the following structure:</p><pre><code>&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="itemlist"&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr class="athing" id="25005567"&gt;
      &lt;td align="right" valign="top" class="title"&gt;
        &lt;span class="rank"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td valign="top" class="votelinks"&gt;
        &lt;center&gt;
          &lt;a id="up_25005567" href="vote?id=25005567&amp;amp;how=up&amp;amp;goto=news"&gt;
            &lt;div class="votearrow" title="upvote"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/center&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td class="title"&gt;
        &lt;a href="https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/835962/ae41b27bc20699ad/" class="storylink"&gt;
          Deprecating scp
        &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;span class="sitebit comhead"&gt; (&lt;a href="from?site=lwn.net"&gt;&lt;span class="sitestr"&gt;lwn.net&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td colspan="2"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td class="subtext"&gt;
        &lt;span class="score" id="score_25005567"&gt;399 points&lt;/span&gt; by &lt;a href="user?id=Tomte" class="hnuser"&gt;Tomte&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;span class="age"&gt;&lt;a href="item?id=25005567"&gt;8 hours ago&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id="unv_25005567"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;a
          href="hide?id=25005567&amp;amp;goto=news"&gt;hide&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="item?id=25005567"&gt;212&amp;nbsp;comments&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr class="spacer" style="height:5px"&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
...
</code></pre><p>Apart from their "archaic" markup, it looks quite clear:</p><p>An item's title is in the <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> with the class <code>title</code>.</p><p>The upvotes, comments etc. are present in the adjacent <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>.</p><p>Then follows a <code>&lt;tr class="spacer"&gt;</code>.</p><h2>Second test: Parsing HTML to HackerNews item</h2><p>A test could look like this:</p><pre><code>test('parses items from html', t =&gt; {
  const news = parseNews(html())
  t.true(Array.isArray(news))
  t.is(news.length, 30)
  t.is(news[0].title, 'Deprecating scp')
  t.is(news[0].url, 'https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/835962/ae41b27bc20699ad/')
  ...
})
</code></pre><p><code>html()</code> is just a function that returns HTML from HackerNews (get the string with <code>view-source:https://news.ycombinator.com/</code>):</p><pre><code>function html () {
  return `&lt;html lang="en" op="news"&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta name="referrer" content="origin"&gt;...`
}
</code></pre><p>So we need a function <code>parseNews</code></p><h2>Parsing the HTML</h2><p>A valid alternative to <code>cheerio</code> is <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-html-parser"><code>node-html-parser</code></a>.</p><p>Install it with <code>npm install node-html-parser</code></p><p><code>parseNews</code> could look like this:</p><pre><code>const { parse } = require('node-html-parser')
function parseNews (html = '') {
  const doc = parse(html)
  const trs = doc.querySelectorAll('table.itemlist tr')
  return trs.reduce((acc, tr, index) =&gt; {
    const titles = tr.querySelectorAll('.title')
    if (titles.length === 2) {
      const title = tr.querySelectorAll('.title')[1].text.replace(/\(.*\)$/, '').trim()
      return acc.concat([{
        title,
        url: tr.querySelector('.title a').getAttribute('href')
      }])
    }
    return acc
  }, [])
}
</code></pre><p>Returning an array like this:</p><pre><code>[
  {
    "title": "Deprecating scp"
  },
  {
    "title": "Gron – Make JSON Greppable"
  },
  ...
</code></pre><p>This satisfies our second test!</p><pre><code>  2 tests passed
</code></pre><h2>Extracting more data</h2><p>Now we just extracted the title from each HackerNews post.</p><p>We can further extract <code>upvotes</code>, <code>author</code>, <code>link</code> and <code>comments</code>.</p><p>Adapting the second test:</p><pre><code>test('parses items from html', t =&gt; {
  const news = parseNews(html())
  console.log(JSON.stringify(news, null, 2))
  t.true(Array.isArray(news))
  t.is(news.length, 30)
  t.is(news[0].title, 'Deprecating scp')
  t.is(news[0].url, 'https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/835962/ae41b27bc20699ad/')
  t.is(news[0].link, 'https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25005567')
  t.is(news[0].author, 'Tomte')
  t.is(news[0].upvotes, 435)
  t.is(news[0].comments, 231)
})
</code></pre><p>To make the test pass, let's add more logic to <code>parseNews</code>:</p><pre><code>function parseNews (html = '') {
  const doc = parse(html)
  const trs = doc.querySelectorAll('table.itemlist tr')
  return trs.reduce((acc, tr, index) =&gt; {
    const titles = tr.querySelectorAll('.title')
    if (titles.length === 2) {
      const title = tr.querySelectorAll('.title')[1].text.replace(/\(.*\)$/, '').trim()
      return acc.concat([{
        title,
        url: tr.querySelector('.title a').getAttribute('href')
      }])
    }
    const subtext = tr.querySelector('.subtext')
    if (subtext) {
      const el = subtext.querySelector('.score')
      const links = subtext.querySelectorAll('a')
      if (!el || links.length !== 4) return acc
      acc[acc.length - 1].upvotes = +el.text.replace(' points', '').trim()
      acc[acc.length - 1].author = links[0].text
      acc[acc.length - 1].comments = +links[links.length - 1].text.replace('comments', '').trim()
      acc[acc.length - 1].link = 'https://news.ycombinator.com/' + links[links.length - 1].getAttribute('href')
      return acc
    }
    return acc
  }, [])
}
</code></pre><p>Super, we now get a whole HackerNews item!</p><p><code>parseNews</code> is a messy garbage of HTML parsing with foreign selectors and special cases.</p><p>To make it a bit easier to read, I would focus on the <code>if</code> statements.</p><p>I'll try to make them clearer by adding two new functions to determine if the <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> contains the title, or contains the upvotes, comments etc.</p><pre><code>function containsTitle (tr) {
  const titles = tr.querySelectorAll('.title')
  return titles.length === 2
}
function containsUpvotes (tr) {
  const subtext = tr.querySelector('.subtext')
  if (!subtext) return false
  const el = subtext.querySelector('.score')
  const links = subtext.querySelectorAll('a')
  if (!el || links.length !== 4) return false
  return true
}
</code></pre><p>These two functions integrated in the current <code>parseNews</code> function:</p><pre><code>function parseNews (html = '') {
  const doc = parse(html)
  const trs = doc.querySelectorAll('table.itemlist tr')
  return trs.reduce((acc, tr, index) =&gt; {
    if (containsTitle(tr)) {
      const title = tr.querySelectorAll('.title')[1].text.replace(/\(.*\)$/, '').trim()
      return acc.concat([{
        title,
        url: tr.querySelector('.title a').getAttribute('href')
      }])
    }
    if (containsUpvotes(tr)) {
      const subtext = tr.querySelector('.subtext')
      const el = subtext.querySelector('.score')
      const links = subtext.querySelectorAll('a')
      if (!el || links.length !== 4) return acc
      acc[acc.length - 1].upvotes = +el.text.replace(' points', '').trim()
      acc[acc.length - 1].author = links[0].text
      acc[acc.length - 1].comments = +links[links.length - 1].text.replace('comments', '').trim()
      acc[acc.length - 1].link = 'https://news.ycombinator.com/' + links[links.length - 1].getAttribute('href')
      return acc
    }
    return acc
  }, [])
}
function containsTitle (tr) {
  const titles = tr.querySelectorAll('.title')
  return titles.length === 2
}
function containsUpvotes (tr) {
  const subtext = tr.querySelector('.subtext')
  if (!subtext) return false
  const el = subtext.querySelector('.score')
  const links = subtext.querySelectorAll('a')
  if (!el || links.length !== 4) return false
  return true
}
</code></pre><p>Now let's write an integration test that verifies we are able to get the HTML and parse HackerNews items.</p><pre><code>test('fetches HTML and parses items', async t =&gt; {
  const html = await getHTML()
  const news = parseNews(html)
  t.is(news.length, 30)
})
</code></pre><p>This already works, awesome!</p><p>This is the heart of our package, so it deserves a place in <code>index.js</code>.</p><p>As well as the other code not used for tests, we put it in a folder <code>lib</code> with their tests.</p><p>The directory structure looks like this:</p><pre><code>➜  hn git:(main) tree -I node_modules
.

November 6, 2020 | https://samizdat.dev/how-i-self-host-my-blog-with-docker-ansible/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://samizdat.dev/how-i-self-host-my-blog-with-docker-ansible/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<article>
    <p>I have always wanted to build a blog, but for a long time, I have been postponing it.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I thought it was difficult to build a blog.
Turns out, even if you self-host it, it’s not that hard.</p>
<p>I decided to finally create it one day, and I had a few criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No fancy admin panels. I want to write markdown and deliver it as is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without sacrificing the privacy of visitors, I should be able to collect traffic statistics, i.e.
Google Analytics. No external JavaScripts.</p>
<p>Just a number of visitors per article per day is enough for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete control over my data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would like to have comments on my website in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="considered-options">Considered options</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A popular blogging platform such as wordpress.com or blogspot.com.</p>
<p>The choice does not provide as much flexibility as I wanted, it has privacy issues, and I don’t
have any control over my data at the end of the day.</p>
<p>The entire platform can be blocked in specific countries sometimes: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_service(#Blocking)">list of contries blocking
blogspot.com on Wikipedia</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GitHub Pages</p>
<p>Almost a flawless hit.</p>
<p>But it’s way too static, which means I’m not going to be able to have comments on my page unless
I use an external solution.</p>
<p>The shipping of something like Disqus sacrifices privacy and leads to no data control.</p>
<p>Things like Disqus also have a price (or they show ads).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Self-hosting has never been so easy, the only hard requirement is to have a Linux server costing $5 a
month for 25GB SSD, 1GB RAM and 1vCPU.</p>
<p>I have selected <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo">Hugo</a> for site generation because it is very
popular, has a large supportive community, uses markdown, and has a lot of free themes.</p>
<h3 id="packaging">Packaging</h3>
<p>Packaging and distribution is done using Docker. This is how tiny my Dockerfile looks:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="dockerfile"><span>FROM</span><span> alpine as build</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>RUN</span> apk add --update --no-cache hugo<span>
</span><span></span><span>WORKDIR</span><span> /srv/http/</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>COPY</span> . /srv/http/<span>
</span><span></span><span>RUN</span> hugo -e production<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>FROM</span><span> nginx:alpine</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>COPY</span> nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf<span>
</span><span></span><span>COPY</span> --from<span>=</span>build /srv/http/public /srv/http/<span>
</span><span></span><span>WORKDIR</span><span> /srv/http/</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>This ends up as a Docker container with Nginx and static HTML and CSS files..
The docker image is approximately 52MB in size.</p>
<p>Just two commands and the blog is ready for deployment:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ docker build -t kovetskiy/my-blog .
$ docker push kovetskiy/my-blog
</code></pre></div><h3 id="deployment">Deployment</h3>
<p>A manual way of deployment and an automatic way are available.</p>
<h4 id="manual-way">Manual way</h4>
<p>Manually, on the remote host, you would end up with commands like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pull the Docker image:
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ docker pull kovetskiy/my-blog
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>Stop and delete existing Docker container:
</li>
<li>Start a new Docker container:
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ docker run --detach --restart<span>=</span>always --name my-blog -p 80:80 kovetskiy/my-blog
</code></pre></div></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="automation-with-ansible">Automation with Ansible</h4>
<p>A playbook is a list of tasks that should be executed to accomplish the desired status.
In my case, it is pulling of the Docker image and starting a Docker container.</p>
<p>The playbook is saved as a file called <code>my-blog.yaml</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">- <span>hosts</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>my-server</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>tasks</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span>- <span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Pull image</span><span>
</span><span>      </span><span>docker_image</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>kovetskiy/my-blog</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span>- <span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Start container</span><span>
</span><span>      </span><span>docker_container</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>my-blog</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>detach</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>image</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>kovetskiy/my-blog</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>restart_policy</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>always</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>state</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>started</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Ansible needs a bit of project-wide configuration, it just has to understand how to connect to this
<code>my-server</code> server.</p>
<p>To tell Ansible where the list of server is, put the following content into <code>ansible.cfg</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>[defaults]</span>
<span>inventory</span> <span>=</span> <span>hosts</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Add your server into the <code>hosts</code> file and replace <code>123.123.123.123</code> with the host’s IP address:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>[my-server]</span>
<span>123.123.123.123</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The deployment will be done with one small command from now on:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ ansible-playbook my-blog.yaml

  <p>Default to Action is the most transformative thing I leared at YCombinator, bar none.</p>

<p>Michael imparted this wisdom during a talk about development cadence and team brainstorming sessions.  It’s not the title of a book or a click-bait HN post, just three words that stood out to me.</p>

<p>I thought, sure, I can default to action but over time, actually using the idea has shown it’s value.  Here are the ways ‘defaulting to action’ has been transformative in our startup journey so far.</p>

<h2 id="changing-a-lightbulb">Changing a Lightbulb</h2>

<p>“Please can you change this lightbulb?” This seems like a harmless question until you know the whole story. Manager A leaves the office, walks onto the factory floor and notices a blown lightbulb.</p>

<p>To fix this, the manager walks around 300 meters (past the cupboard containing spare lightbulbs) to a factory employee currently working through a cutting list on an industrial saw.</p>

<p>Manager A stops the factory employee from what he is doing and takes him to see the blown bulb.  This involves walking back past the cupboard with the lightbulbs in.  The managers asks: “Please can you change this lightbulb?”</p>

<p>And so it goes on.  Why didn’t the manager just change the lightbulb in the first place?</p>

<p>I watched this playout and was genuinely shocked but of course, if it’s not your job to change the lightbulbs then it must be someone elses.</p>

<p>Well, in startup land, it’s everyone’s job to change the lightbulb.  You just have to default to action.</p>

<p>This ‘every job is everyone’s job’ in small companies it pretty obvious (there are only two of us so someone has to do ‘it’) but I think it’s the simplest way to start implementing default to action.  If you see something that needs doing, just do it.  The efficieny gains are plain to see and time is a rare commodity</p>

<p>But there are more subtle ways defaulting to action has helped.</p>

<h2 id="perfection-is-thine-enemy">Perfection is Thine Enemy</h2>

<p>What you build will likely never be finished.  That’s not to say, you shouldn’t strive for excellence but perfection perverts progress.</p>

<p>Strive for perfection and you may never launch.  For a year or more, we worked on perfecting passwordless authentication as a service.  It didn’t work as a business so we pivoted but why did it take so long to figure that out?</p>

<p>We didn’t default to action.  We found great reasons to carry on building, crafting excellent marketing messages and attempting to build communities but we didn’t sell and because we didn’t sell, we didn’t realise the issues with our business model that were present.</p>

<p>This is where it gets subtle.  You could argue we had plenty of ‘action’ going on but like the factory manager and his lightbulb, we merely looked busy.</p>

<p>We were setting everything up to change the lightbulb without ever actually changing the lightbulb.  It’s at this point you stop being a developer and you start being a business woman / man.</p>

<h2 id="action-stations">Action Stations</h2>

<p>It was time for some proper action so, during YC S20, we pivoted. Not a cutesy re-think of our direction but a full-blown, tools down, have a cry, delete the repo and start fresh pivot.</p>

<p>Our group partners practically spat their coffee out when we announced it during group office hours. One day were were working on passwordless, the next we were working on Plum Mail.</p>

<p>We didn’t consult or cogitate, we just got on with it.  I think you know when an idea is dead and there is little value in moping about in a black bathrobe for weeks on end.  You just figure out what to do instead and start doing it.</p>

<p>“I think we just defaulted to action,” Pete said.  “Yes, I think we did.” And default to action has been our saying of the day ever since.</p>

<p>Pivoting three weeks before demo day focusses you. In three short weeks we conceived a new <a href="https://app.plummail.co/">product</a>, built enough of it make a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf-82ychDgA">video</a>, launched a <a href="https://plummail.co/">marketing site</a> and put the whole thing out on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24237818">Hacker News</a>.  We built a waitlist, presented at <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/22033">demo day</a> and picked up some investment.</p>

<p>It was far from perfect but this time spent was quite literally transformative from the decision to pivot to implementing our demo-day plans.</p>

<h2 id="a-lasting-impression">A Lasting Impression</h2>

<p>Defaulting to action has defined this part of our startup journey in more ways than I had originally appreciated.</p>

<p>We are working on our Action First Inbox concept at the moment.  Quite independently from the words ‘default to action’ our product has adopted the very idea that has come to define us.</p>

<p>Action, good productive action is what we needed in our company and what we defaulted to when thinking about how to add value in our product.</p>

<p>This is why I believe the statement default to action has done more than encourage us to ‘just change the lightbulb’ but has been a genuinely transformative force in our startup.</p>

<![CDATA[Improve Software Debugging with Binary Analysis]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
<div>
<article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>One of the seriously underutilized tools of the trade in the software development world, at least in my experience, has been binary analysis. We have linters, unit tests, correctness proofs, and static analysis tools to help catch bugs in our software. However, when a bug inevitably pops up that escapes all these checks, it could be hard to fix. Binary analysis can enhance our debugging toolkit by catching bugs that stem from the compiler. While most binary analysis is done in the field of security, many of those principles can be brought into normal software development to fix hard-to-detect problems as well.</p>
<p>For example, I came across a problem recently where a program’s floating-point output would differ across different compilers and operating systems. The code compiled in both cases were the same, except that the computers were running dfferent operating systems, and had different versions of the compiler. While we only had support for one operating system, we also used the other operating system for testing purposes, since it had packages in its repo that we needed and weren’t on the other one. So, Dockerizing the program was not practical.</p>
<p>Since the only major difference between the two builds was the compiler and CPU, I suspected that it had something to do with the optimization flags, and the binary that the compiler creates. So, I opened up a binary analysis software to take a look at the offending <code>.so</code> files.</p>
<p>The two files were virtually identical, with similar control flow graphs and instruction sets. What stood out, however, was that the original binary was using lots of <code>movapd</code> where the other binary was using <code>fmul</code>. Hmm, <code>movapd</code> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE2">SSE2 instruction</a>, while <code>fmul</code> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X87">x87 instruction</a>. SSE2 is a much newer (and faster, if used correctly) instruction set than x87, with the former being released in 2000 and the latter being released in 1980. It seems like our two compiler versions had understood <code>-O2</code> to mean different things.</p>
<p>As it turns out, GCC automatically enables SSE2 instructions for 64-bit programs with the argument <code>-msse2</code>. However, since we were building a 32-bit program, it defaulted to x87 instructions. This makes sense for general purpose computing, since the x86 was introduced in 1985, and there’s no guarantee that the processor would support the instrution set if it was 32-bit. Since the first AMD64 processor was released in 2003, and the first IA-64 processor in 2001, it was reasonable to assume that an IA-64 or AMD64 CPU would be able to handle SSE2. The difference here arises from how SSE2 calculates floating point operations at double precision, but x87 uses higher precision 80-bit precision values for intermediate operations.</p>
<p>This was a long aside, but this little bug was easily solved by adding a <code>-msse2</code> to all builds, since we were <em>pretty</em> sure that none of our machines was running on a pre-2000 CPU. However, we would’ve never found this bug, and probably would have resorted to building all our dependencies manually, if we didn’t realize that the compilers created different binaries. So, hopefully having convinced you of the importance of binary analysis, I’ll do my best to run through the basics of it.</p>
<h3 id="frameworks-apps-and-more">Frameworks, apps, and more</h3>
<p>There’s quite a few binary analysis frameworks out there, each with their strengths. Some of the more common ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/">IDA Pro</a>, a popular and powerful proprietary tool with a limited free version. It’s the first tool I use to analyze a binary, though often I will have to use another tool to continue working with it, since the free version doesn’t have a decompiler. I’ve heard good things about the paid addons though.</li>
<li><a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/">Ghidra</a>, a software reverse engineering tool with a very good decompiler. I also really like the binary diff feature, which works with assembly instructions. It’s made by the NSA.</li>
<li><a href="https://angr.io/">angr</a>, which is more of a Python library that happens to work well in a Python shell too. It’s great for writing automated code that works with binary code. It also has a very powerful solver engine that allows you to figure out the inputs of a program given the output. There’s a GUI frontend in development now, but it’s in its early stages.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.radare.org/">radare2</a>, which works very well in a CLI, and happens to have a GUI frontend called Cutter. I use it to run through code with the debugging feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I personally use these tools for some specific features that they have, each of these tools have nearly the same functionality, though it may buried behind a different menu bar or shell command. It’s probably best to try each one out, and select the ones that you like best.</p>
<h3 id="the-binary">The Binary</h3>
<p>The binary output of <code>gcc</code> or <code>clang</code> (or any compiler that compiles to assembly) is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">ELF executable</a>. By default this executable will be named <code>a.out</code>, but that can be overridden with <code>-o</code>. Simply put, ELF is a common standard for how data is arranged in a binary program that divides the file into segments. These include (in order):</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>ELF Header</strong>, which contains basic information about the executable such as memory segments, sections, and other essential information.</li>
<li>The <strong>Program Header</strong>, which contains information about how to execute the program, such as where to load the instructions and the size of it.</li>
<li><strong>Sections</strong>, which are of different types. For example, the <code>.data</code> section contains numerical constants, while the <code>.rodata</code> section contains constant strings. <code>.bss</code> sections contain static variables that have not been initialized. The most important section is the <code>.text</code> section, which contains the program’s assembly instructions.
<ul>
<li><strong>Debug Sections</strong> can be found in some ELF executables as well. These are DWARF debug sections that can be used with GDB or Valgrind. They’re identified with headers named <code>.debug_*</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/corkami">@corkami</a> created a very nice visualization of the layout of an ELF file here:</p>
<p><a href="https://h313.info/blog/assets/img/elf_poster.png"><img src="https://h313.info/blog/assets/img/elf_poster.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Program files are not the only type of files that utilize ELF. Library files with <code>.so</code> and <code>.a</code> extensions also use ELF to arrange their data. This format plays and important part in getting the dynamic linker to work properly, by listing the required libraries in the <code>.interp</code> section.</p>
<p>By looking into specific sections of the ELF executable, we can find constants that are used in the code, as well as check for debug data in the executable.</p>
<h3 id="the-control-flow-graph">The Control Flow Graph</h3>
<p>What we saw above was the physical layout of the executable, which is how it is stored on the disk. However, a more interesting layout of the executable (at least for binary analysis) is the program’s control flow graph, or CFG. The CFG is a representation of the program’s behaviour, with blocks of commands as nodes, and instructions like <code>jmp</code>, <code>return</code>, and <code>call</code> being the edges. This gives us an easy way to understand the behaviour of the program, and we can often match functions to nodes in the program.</p>
<p>For example, take a look at this program, compiled with <code>g++</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
</span>
<span>void</span> <span>do_thing</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cout</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"thing"</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>endl</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>do_other_thing</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cout</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"beep boop"</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>endl</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Generate and compare 2 random numbers</span>
  <span>auto</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>rand</span><span>()</span> <span>%</span> <span>10</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>auto</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>rand</span><span>()</span> <span>%</span> <span>10</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>

  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span>
    <span>do_thing</span><span>();</span>
  <span>else</span>
    <span>do_other_thing</span><span>();</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>When we open the control flow graph of <code>main()</code> in IDA, we see this:</p>
<p><img src="https://h313.info/blog/assets/img/cfg/gcc_default.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can see how each set of instructions generates <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, and particularly the call to <code>rand()</code> with the <code>call _rand</code> assembly instruction. We also see that the function splits into two at the if statement, jumping to either calling the <code>_do_thing</code> or <code>do_other_thing()</code> function, and then finally returning and ending the program after the function is called. The CFG is the easiest way to examine how an unknown binary works, and provides good intuition into what a program does.</p>
<p>Now, let’s see what happens when we run it again, but this time with <code>g++ -O3</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://h313.info/blog/assets/img/cfg/gcc_o3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This time, we see that the random number generation takes a lot less instructions than before. In this case, <code>-O3</code> compared the two random numbers in the stack, instead of saving them into storage and then loading them again. That gets rid of the <code>mov</code> commands using the <code>rbp</code> registers, so in essense <code>main()</code> in the assembly code has become:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>()</span> <span>%</span> <span>10</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>rand</span><span>()</span> <span>%</span> <span>10</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
  <span>do_thing</span><span>();</span>
<span>else</span>
  <span>do_other_thing</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Let’s take another look at it, this time using the Intel C++ Compiler. We compile it this time with <code>icpc -march=icelake -O3</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://h313.info/blog/assets/img/cfg/icpc_o3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can see that this time, our compiler inlined the single line <code>do_thing()</code> and <code>do_other_thing()</code> functions. We also see it using registers like <code>r9d</code>, which are 64-bit only, and an AVX instruction too, <code>vstmxcsr</code>. Intel’s compiler does this often since it’s used heavily in high performance computing.</p>
<p>These three compilations all ended up with different binaries, but as we can see the control flow graphs of these programs are almost the same. This shows why the CFG is so important in binary analysis. Not only does it make assembly easier to read, but we can spot similar functions using this as well.</p>
<h3 id="analyzing-a-real-cfg">Analyzing a Real CFG</h3>
<p>I’m going to analyze <a href="https://yx7.cc/code/">hyx</a>, a command-line hex editor with vim keybindings, as an example here. This is mostly due to the small size of the code base, the fact that the source code is in C so it’s easier to analyze, and the fact that it compiles into a single binary with no library dependencies. To start, we’ll take a look at the ELF headers with <code>readelf</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>~/hyx-2020.06.09
⟩ readelf -hl hyx
ELF Header:
  Magic:   7f 45 4c 46 02 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>There’s a video on youtube a friend of mine recommended I watch…but it’s an hour long and that’s <em>so long</em>. Be nice if I could just read / skim it instead. Cuts the involvement time down from an hour to maybe 10 minutes. Enter youtube-dl, closed captions, and some bad scripting.</p>

<p>If I download the closed captions of the video with youtube-dl</p>
<div><div><pre><code>youtube-dl --write-auto-sub --skip-download &lt;youtube-link-goes-here&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>and then open them with something like nano, it’s basically unreadable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>00:51:48.019 --&gt; 00:51:48.029 align:start position:0%
distributed over a group of cells they


00:51:48.029 --&gt; 00:51:49.819 align:start position:0%
distributed over a group of cells they
themselves&lt;00:51:48.630&gt;&lt;c&gt; purely&lt;/c&gt;&lt;00:51:48.989&gt;&lt;c&gt; at&lt;/c&gt;&lt;00:51:49.259&gt;&lt;c&gt; the&lt;/c&gt;&lt;00:51:49.380&gt;&lt;c&gt; electrical&lt;/c&gt;

00:51:49.819 --&gt; 00:51:49.829 align:start position:0%
themselves purely at the electrical


00:51:49.829 --&gt; 00:51:51.229 align:start position:0%
themselves purely at the electrical
level&lt;00:51:50.069&gt;&lt;c&gt; with&lt;/c&gt;&lt;00:51:50.219&gt;&lt;c&gt; no&lt;/c&gt;&lt;00:51:50.249&gt;&lt;c&gt; transcriptional&lt;/c&gt;&lt;00:51:51.209&gt;&lt;c&gt; changes&lt;/c&gt;

00:51:51.229 --&gt; 00:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
level with no transcriptional changes
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>That example is from a video partially titled <em>Bioelectric Computation Outside the Nervous System</em>.  Interesting stuff, but long.</p>

<p>So, time to experiment with some line manipulation.  Let’s grab just the captions, and make the filename something easy.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>youtube-dl --output "captions.%(ext)s" --write-auto-sub --skip-download &lt;video&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The name of the downloaded file is <code>captions.en.vtt</code>. Looks like the default language is english, hence the <code>en</code>. Let’s start cutting down the noise.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>sed '/ --&gt; /d' captions.en.vtt
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This removes every line that’s got the arrow in it. Check it out:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>distributed over a group of cells they


distributed over a group of cells they
themselves&lt;00:51:48.630&gt;&lt;c&gt; purely&lt;/c&gt;&lt;00:51:48.989&gt;&lt;c&gt; at&lt;/c&gt;&lt;00:51:49.259&gt;&lt;c&gt; the&lt;/c&gt;&lt;00:51:49.380&gt;&lt;c&gt; electrical&lt;/c&gt;

themselves purely at the electrical


themselves purely at the electrical
level&lt;00:51:50.069&gt;&lt;c&gt; with&lt;/c&gt;&lt;00:51:50.219&gt;&lt;c&gt; no&lt;/c&gt;&lt;00:51:50.249&gt;&lt;c&gt; transcriptional&lt;/c&gt;&lt;00:51:51.209&gt;&lt;c&gt; changes&lt;/c&gt;

level with no transcriptional changes
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Better.  There’s still some weird stuff in there, and it looks superfluous.  The <code>&lt;c&gt;</code> string looks like it’s always in those lines, so let’s cut any line with one of those.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>sed '/ --&gt; /d' captions.en.vtt | sed '/&lt;c&gt;/d'
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>That’s even better:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>distributed over a group of cells they


distributed over a group of cells they

themselves purely at the electrical


themselves purely at the electrical

level with no transcriptional changes
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>But not finished yet. Tons of blank lines.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>sed '/ --&gt; /d' captions.en.vtt | sed '/&lt;c&gt;/d' | sed '/^[[:space:]]*$/d'
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Without the lines, this is what we get:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>distributed over a group of cells they
distributed over a group of cells they
themselves purely at the electrical
themselves purely at the electrical
level with no transcriptional changes
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Well, at least it’s finally concise. Looks like each line is duplicated, though.  There’s a cool linux tool that can find duplications - long as they’re adjacent - and remove them. Often it’s combined with <code>sort</code>, which can put similar or identical lines next to each other. In this case, we don’t need that.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>sed '/ --&gt; /d' captions.en.vtt | sed '/&lt;c&gt;/d' | sed '/^[[:space:]]*$/d' | uniq 
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We just want each line to be <code>uniq</code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>distributed over a group of cells they
themselves purely at the electrical
level with no transcriptional changes
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And we have it! The whole thing is going to read like some strange poem, especially since the closed captions will probably have made each line take about the same amount of time to say.  But, it’s better than the alternative, where we take out all the remaining line breaks and it turns into a giant wall of text.</p>

<p>Putting the whole thing together into a script, we get this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>link</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>
<span>fn</span><span>=</span><span>"captions"</span>

youtube-dl <span>--output</span> <span>$fn</span>.%<span>(</span>ext<span>)</span>s <span>--write-auto-sub</span> <span>--skip-download</span> <span>$link</span>

<span>sed</span> <span>'/--&gt;/d'</span> <span>$fn</span>.en.vtt | <span>sed</span> <span>'/&lt;c&gt;/d'</span> | <span>sed</span> <span>'/^[[:space:]]*$/d'</span> | <span>uniq</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>$fn</span>.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<h2 id="000005">00:00:05</h2>

<div><p>Welcome to Signals and Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky.</p><p> So, this time we’re going to do something a little different than our usual episode. Instead of digging in deep with one person talking on one focused technical topic, we have a few people here today and the topic is a general one, which is we’re going to talk about Jane Street’s internship. So we have three people who know a lot about it in that they’ve all gone through the internship before: Grace Zhang, Jeanne Van Briesen, and Matt Else. And we’re going to talk with them about what their experience was like, both at the time of the internship and also how that transitioned to being a full-timer here, how that worked. </p><p>So, to start with, let’s have you guys all introduce yourselves and tell us a little bit about where you’re from and where you guys are now.</p></div>

<h2 id="000049">00:00:49</h2>

<p>Yeah, of course. I’m Grace. I just graduated from Harvard this past May. I studied CS and Statistics at school, and I just joined Jane Street full-time pretty soon after graduation. I am a software developer on Risk, which is also a team that I interned on last summer. So, I am back in the Jane Street New York office full-time, and excited to be back since I’m also from New York originally.</p>

<h2 id="000112">00:01:12</h2>

<p>Although these days not quite the same notion of office as we used to have.</p>

<h2 id="000116">00:01:16</h2>

<p>That’s right. (laughter) Perhaps you don’t really get the feel of the difference between the New York and London offices so much these days. (laughter)</p>

<h2 id="000123">00:01:23</h2>

<p>Yeah. I’m Matt Else. I work in the London office, and I graduated from Cambridge in 2019 and started as a full-timer around September 2019 after interning in the summer of 2018. I now work in a team in Trading Systems where I’ve worked since I started as a full-timer.</p>

<h2 id="000143">00:01:43</h2>

<p>And I’m Jeanne. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon about a year ago. I interned two years ago now, and I currently work on a team called RFQ.</p>

<h2 id="000151">00:01:51</h2>

<p>So, Jeanne, how did you hear about Jane Street?</p>

<h2 id="000154">00:01:54</h2>

<p>I heard about Jane Street through Carnegie Mellon’s functional programming class. People would always ask questions like, “Oh, when is functional programming going to be useful?” And then they would say, “Oh, but don’t say Jane Street because we know they’re the only one who uses functional programming.”</p>

<h2 id="000204">00:02:04</h2>

<p>It sounded like you said Carnegie Mellon’s functional programming class as opposed to Carnegie Mellon’s functional programming cult.</p>

<h2 id="000213">00:02:13</h2>

<p>Well, the functional programming cult sort of originates from the functional programming class maybe.</p>

<h2 id="000215">00:02:15</h2>

<p>(laughter)</p>

<h2 id="000216">00:02:16</h2>

<p>Yeah. CMU has quite a big programming languages group and quite a few functional programming classes, and there’s a lot of hype for functional programming there. I was one of those people who both bought into the hype and was perpetuating the hype.</p>

<h2 id="000231">00:02:31</h2>

<p>In fact, you literally taught a class called “Hype for Types.”</p>

<h2 id="000232">00:02:32</h2>

<p>This is right. Yeah. That class is still going on now. So, there have been three generations of instructors now. It’s still going strong. So, yeah, applying to Jane Street was really a no-brainer for me because it was a place that was known for doing functional programming.</p>

<h2 id="000249">00:02:49</h2>

<p>Okay. Great. I feel like you act as an effective representative of a small but important set of people who apply to Jane Street because of an unhealthy interest in functional programming. Grace, how about you?</p>

<h2 id="000301">00:03:01</h2>

<p>So, Harvard also has a functional programming class, but we just have one. That was definitely a good start to spark my interest in functional programming, and Ron also came and gave a short talk on using OCaml in the real world, which was actually pretty cool because that was certainly a question a lot of us had coming into the course. I eventually got to know Jane Street through INSIGHT, which is Jane Street’s program for women in STEM. There are different tracks. So, I did the dev track at INSIGHT and it’s pretty cool because I think it gave you a good sense of what it’s like to work at Jane Street and work with the people at Jane Street. INSIGHT is a week-long program where they bring you to the Jane Street New York office and you go through something like an OCaml bootcamp where you do different exercises to learn about OCaml and get a taste of the kind of work that we do here at Jane Street, and I thought that was really cool. I really enjoyed working with the people at INSIGHT and I felt like I got to see a lot of the culture at Jane Street, which was really exciting. I applied to Jane Street to be an intern last summer and am now back full-time.</p>

<h2 id="000404">00:04:04</h2>

<p>By the way, now that you’re here full-time, have you gotten involved in INSIGHT from the other side?</p>

<h2 id="000410">00:04:10</h2>

<p>Yeah, that’s pretty cool! INSIGHT is during January, so I haven’t quite done it yet, but I will be helping out with INFOCUS and I’ve also helped out with some of the other programs. So, it’s pretty exciting to be on the other side of things because I think these programs are really important and really help spark an interest.</p>

<h2 id="000425">00:04:25</h2>

<p>Right, and when you say these programs, these are like various kinds of outreach programs essentially. INSIGHT is aiming for reaching out to women, there are some that are aimed for trying to get at various non-core schools – we have overrepresented from like a small number of schools where we get a lot of people – and trying to branch out, and there’s some programs we’re working on for underrepresented minorities. So, there’s a bunch of different efforts in different directions there.</p>

<h2 id="000448">00:04:48</h2>

<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah – really excited to be part of it.</p>

<h2 id="000449">00:04:49</h2>

<p>Great. Matt, how about you?</p>

<h2 id="000451">00:04:51</h2>

<p>Yeah. So, similar to both Jeanne and Grace, I’d done a little bit of functional programming at university, and I guess unlike Jeanne, the cult of OCaml doesn’t stretch quite so widely at Cambridge, but it was certainly something that I had come across and kind of enjoyed, but the main reason I applied for an internship at Jane Street was because a friend of mine, who at the time was a visiting student from MIT, had done the internship the summer before, told me all about it, told me how much fun it was and how interesting it was, and generally just kind of made me want to apply as well, and as it turns out we’re now both full-timers here at Jane Street.</p>

<h2 id="000524">00:05:24</h2>

<div><p>That’s great. </p><p>So, one thing that immediately strikes me from these stories is that you guys are a little unrepresentative in that you’ve all had functional programming experience, and maybe all programmed specifically in OCaml before coming here, whereas I think in reality if you sample incoming interns, a quite solid majority I think haven’t done any functional programming at all, which is actually a pretty big change from what recruiting was like 12 years ago or something where I think at that point we leaned pretty heavily on, “Hey, we program in this interesting functional programming language, so maybe you want to come work here anyway,” and now we have lots of other ways of attracting people, and so the functional programming part is much less of the thing that brings people in the door, and indeed I think people often think to come work here they have to already know OCaml, which is totally not true, and in fact people sometimes think they should interview in OCaml, which is also almost always the wrong idea because there’s really a very small slice of people for whom OCaml is the language that they can best show what they’re good at, and people who choose to use OCaml to please us often discover that it is not a very effective technique. </p><p>Anyway, I was wondering if you guys could say a little bit more about how the internship worked. What’s the basic structure of the internship?</p></div>

<h2 id="000632">00:06:32</h2>

<div><p>Yeah. So, I guess I can talk about it first since it’s perhaps a little bit fresher on my mind than for Jeanne and Matt. </p><p>I interned last summer, and I think I really enjoyed Jane Street’s internship structure actually. I think that was one of the first things that I think I was pretty excited about, which is Jane Street’s dev internship is structured so that you can work on two different teams and oftentimes they are like two teams that are spread across the firm. That was really nice. So, for example, I worked on the larger trading systems team and also post-trade, and I thought that was pretty cool. It kind of gives you a better sense of the firm as a whole and kind of gives you a little bit more exposure there.</p><p> So, I think it was really nice to have been able to intern on two teams, and also the internship is structured, like Ron mentioned before, so that it doesn’t assume that anyone comes in with any OCaml knowledge. So, the first I think week or so of the internship, we did an OCaml Bootcamp, which is a way to help people learn the kinds of tools and the language that we use at Jane Street, which I think is pretty exciting, and it was really cool because, you know, the internship class does it as a whole, and so it was nice to start off your internship with the rest of your class and all go through this together.</p></div>

<h2 id="000808">00:08:08</h2>

<p>That’s a lovely thing about the internship that I think wasn’t clear to me until it just kind of happened is how nice the community of people who come in all at the same time, all knowing nothing about the organization and about the technology, and just come to be friends with each other, and that’s I think been a very positive experience for lots of people over the years.</p>

<h2 id="000823">00:08:23</h2>

<p>For sure. That was a great way to introduce us to each other and build this internship community. I think that’s definitely one of my favorite parts as well because once you finish OCaml Bootcamp, all the interns sit next to their teams and mentors, and so you’re kind of more spread out, but it was really nice – I sat close to a few different interns, and you know, sometimes when you’re super caught up in the code …</p></div></div>

<p>The standard library contains a ton of code that we don’t want to write ourselves, including printf, scanf, math functions, and so forth. So, we need to make sure our operating system can link to this library and everything “just works”. This post will show you how I linked our operating system to a standard library, newlib, and the trials and tribulations encountered in doing so.</p>

<hr>



<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>



<p>Libraries allow programmers to start writing programs at a higher level. If anyone remembers back to the 80s where personal computers would boot to a BASIC editor, you essentially had to write your programs from scratch.</p>



<p>The term library just means some place to store code. Generally, this code is an object file of compiled and assembled source code. Shared objects can also be loaded <em>on-demand</em>, but this requires a little bit of extra support from a dynamic linker. See my post about dynamic linking here: <a href="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/2020/06/22/dynamic-linking/" data-type="post" data-id="407">Dynamic Linking</a>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="thelibrary">The Library</h2>



<p>Many of the most useful routines will be written once and then stored into either a <em>shared object</em> (so) or an archive (a). We know that libraries allow us to pull in already-written code, but there is a more fundamental reason for a library–to make interfacing with the operating system easy.</p>



<p>If you’ve read my blog posts on a RISC-V operating system using Rust, you will know how an application can make a request from the operating system itself. Generally, this is done through system calls. These system calls are given a number. For example, in Linux on an x86-64 system, system call #0 is the <em>exit</em> system call. However, nothing really says that we have to use these numbers.</p>



<p>If we take a look at libgloss, which is a low-level library written for newlib, we can see the following standard:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image.png" alt="" width="249" height="380" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image.png 497w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-196x300.png 196w" sizes="(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px"><figcaption>libgloss syscall.h file</figcaption></figure></div>



<hr>



<h2 id="syscalls">System Calls</h2>



<p>So, as you can see, the job of a low-level library is to make sure the arguments are in the right location, the system call number is in the correct register, and that the system call is actually made. For RISC-V, the final instruction we execute is <em>ecall</em>, for “environment call”. This instruction will jump us into the operating system. The OS will handle this by first understanding that it is handling a system call. Second, it will look at the system call number and route it to the correct routine.</p>



<p>In my OS blog, you can see I do the same thing here: <a href="https://osblog.stephenmarz.com/ch7.html">https://osblog.stephenmarz.com/ch7.html</a></p>



<p>We can see this in terms of a common function, such as printf(). This function will first use the application to form a full string. So, something like printf(“Hello %s”, “Stephen”) will cause the function to build a string that reads “Hello Stephen\0”. The final step is for printf() to print it to the <em>stdout</em> file handle. Barring any redirections, this is generally the console. So, the library function(s) must eventually call the <em>write</em> system call with the file descriptor (number) listed first, a pointer to the string second, and finally the number of bytes to write third.</p>



<p>At the end of a system call, control is handed back to the user application. In this case, printf() will have to handle whatever return value is received from the write system call. If we perform a system call trace, or strace, we can see that indeed <em>write</em> is the end goal for printf.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-1024x105.png" alt="" width="512" height="53" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-1024x105.png 1024w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-300x31.png 300w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-768x78.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1.png 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></figure></div>



<p>In the output above, we can see that printf() decided to call write with file descriptor 1, which is standard output, the string buffer “Hello Stephen”, which is lastly 13 characters. Notice that printf() must be able to find the NULL-terminator (\0) to count the number of <em>printing</em> characters.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="our_kernel">Our Kernel</h2>



<p>When we look in our kernel, we have to be able to handle how the library makes the system call. As you can see, most of these system calls follow the UNIX SYSV convention, such as exit, read, write, and so forth, and where everything this a file descriptor, including network sockets and actual files.</p>



<p>The example below shows how I implemented the <em>open</em> system call. You can see that since the application is using virtual memory, I am required to find out where that is in physical memory so the kernel can go find it. Mixing the two or <em>crossing streams</em> is never a good idea.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6-1024x613.png" alt="" width="768" height="460" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6-1024x613.png 1024w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6-300x180.png 300w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6-768x460.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6.png 1223w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></figure></div>



<p>In the code above, I check to see if the path given by the user (the first parameter) is somewhere in the virtual file system. If it is, then we can create a new file descriptor and link it to that file. As you can tell, this system call is by no means completely able to handle all of the different types of files out there, including nodes (sockets, fifos, etc).</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="guarantees">Guarantees</h2>



<p>The C++ standard actually contains information about the standard library. This includes complexity guarantees and memory footprints.</p>



<p>The library would also be best to know about all of the exploits of the underlying architecture. For example, strcpy (string copy) can exploit the AVX or SSE extensions if the CPU supports them.</p>



<p>Looking at the C++ 2011 standard, which I found for free here <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2011/n3242.pdf">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2011/n3242.pdf</a> outlines the different standard functions that need to be supported to be considered C++ standard.</p>



<p>Here’s just one example of the requirements for the container library on page 717 (731 is the PDF page).</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-7-1024x484.png" alt="" width="768" height="363" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-7-1024x484.png 1024w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-7-300x142.png 300w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-7-768x363.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-7.png 1338w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></figure></div>

<h2 id="starting_and_ending">Starting and Ending</h2>



<p>Another interesting part of libraries is that some portions of them can help the language function properly. These libraries are usually called <em>runtimes</em>. Most languages now have a runtime, which is code that is executed when the program runs, rather than when it is compiled or linked.</p>



<p>How many of you really knew that <em>int main</em> is not our real entry point for running a program? Instead, this belongs to a memory label called <em>_start</em>. This label is the ELF (executable and linkable format) entry point where the operating system will set your application to start running.</p>



<p>The _start will eventually call int main, but it has to set up some things include command line arguments, or at the very least putting them into the int argc, and char *argv[] parameters.</p>



<p>We can see the _start routines in the crt0.S assembly file, which stands for C-runtime. The 0 is the first runtime, as more runtimes can be added in different files, such as crt1.S and so forth.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-2-987x1024.png" alt="" width="494" height="512" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-2-987x1024.png 987w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-2-289x300.png 289w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-2-768x797.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-2.png 1254w" sizes="(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px"><figcaption>The _start routine</figcaption></figure></div>



<hr>



<p>You can see in the code above, before main is even called, the BSS (uninitialized global variables) is cleared to 0, the global pointer (gp) is set, and the atexit functions (global termination functions) are registered. Finally, argc, argv, and envp all get their proper locations. For RISC-V, this is a0, a1, and a2.</p>



<p>You can see that the last thing to occur is the exit call. This will take the return value of main, which will be in the register a0. The <em>tail</em> instruction means that it will not return. Both call and tail are pseudo-instructions in RISC-V, which can be seen in the RISC-V specification:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3-1024x122.png" alt="" width="768" height="92" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3-1024x122.png 1024w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3-300x36.png 300w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3-768x92.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3.png 1288w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>tail writes the return address to the zero register, effectively discarding it.</figcaption></figure></div>



<hr>



<h2 id="dynlink">Handling Dynamic Linking</h2>



<p>Dynamic linking requires us to parse the executable and linkable format (ELF) a little bit more robustly than we did in our <a href="https://osblog.stephenmarz.com/">RISC-V OS in Rust</a>. The dynamic linker requires an executable <em>interpreter</em> that lives somewhere on the storage device. You can actually look at an executable file to see what interpreter it will request when those dynamically-linked functions are called.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-4-1024x157.png" alt="" width="768" height="118" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-4-1024x157.png 1024w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-4-300x46.png 300w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-4-768x118.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-4-1536x236.png 1536w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-4.png 1630w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>readelf -l myexec</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>You can see the executable file above is going to use /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 to run this simple test executable that I compiled. We can actually run that interpreter and see what it says:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-1024x347.png" alt="" width="768" height="260" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-1024x347.png 1024w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-300x102.png 300w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-768x260.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-1536x521.png 1536w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5.png 1685w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>Invoking the dynamic linker directly</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As you can see, the INTERP is a particular program header that our operating system would have to be able to handle and spawn a thread to the dynamic linker. However, this was way more than our custom operating system could handle. So now, our operating system will require that the standard library be statically linked into our program. This means that all of the functions and routines that are needed by the program will have to be stored in the executable. This significantly increases the size of our program depending on the number of library function calls made in the lifetime of the executable.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>I haven’t even begun to dive deeply at all that goes into designing and creating a library. In my software engineering courses, I show that libraries can be a great tool to aggregate many different teams’ code into a single project. Keep in mind that I’m looking at this with a fairly low-level lens.</p>



<p>Most libraries have a particular architecture and operating system in mind. This leads to some challenges with a custom OS. In fact, more often than not, I ended up copying Linux’s conventions just to avoid pain later. In the grand scheme of things, this might not seem to be a big deal. However, it forces you to think a certain way about an operating system.</p>



<p>Getting a big philosophical–Linux has changed over the years, but it still has a core philosophy. Many operating systems that were derived from it, including Android, are now being rendered obsolete for a new, refreshing look at operating systems. In fact, Google has started the <a href="https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/get-started">Fuchsia project</a>, which aims to build a modular operating system to replace Android in its mobile devices.</p>

<p>HP never stopped innovating. From its origins in the 1930s as a leading electronics manufacturer to its role in the birth of PCs and performance servers, it has always demonstrated incredible ingenuity.</p>
<p>Today, that ingenuity is deployed in service of evil ink-based fuckery.</p>
<p>The printer-ink business model has always been a form of commercial sadism in which you are expected to put giant manufacturers' interests ahead of your own with no expectation of any sort of reciprocity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer</a></p>
<p>After all, when your profits depend on charging more for ink than vintage Veuve-Clicquot, you need to get up to some serious shenanigans to get your customers to drain their bank accounts to fill their printers.</p>
<p>By contemporary standards, the opening hostilities in the ink-wars look positively quaint:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manufacturing special half-full cartridges to ship with new printers so their owners have to buy a new set just days after the open the box
</li>
<li>
<p>Requiring frequent "calibration" printouts that use vast amounts of ink</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gimmicking cartridges' sensors to declare them "empty" even when there's still ink in them</p>

<p>Thing is, all of this just makes official printer ink less desirable and fuels demand for third party ink.</p>
<p>For this to work, you need to win a two-front war: one on your customers and the other on your competitors. HP is fighting both.</p>
<p>First they pioneered the use of DRM to detect and prevent third-party ink.</p>
<p>Then when ink makers started making their own chips, or harvesting chips out of discarded cartridges to use in new ones, HP got US customs to seize the product, calling it a patent infringement.</p>
<p>But the real ugliness started in March 2016, when HP pushed out a fake "security update" for inkjet printers. Owners who ran the update saw nothing, just a software version number that went up by one.</p>
<p>What they didn't know was that they've been given an asymptomatic infection – a malicious update that only kicked in five months later, after everyone had had a good long time to update. That update's real purpose was to detect and reject third party ink.</p>
<p>It went off right after school started, stranding cash-strapped parents with a year's worth of ink for their kids' school projects. People were outraged. HP issued a nonpology.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/09/what-hp-must-do-make-amends-its-self-destructing-printers">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/09/what-hp-must-do-make-amends-its-self-destructing-printers</a></p>
<p>(One year later, they did it again)</p>
<p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/one-year-after-bricking-third-party-ink-with-update-hp-1809073739">https://gizmodo.com/one-year-after-bricking-third-party-ink-with-update-hp-1809073739</a></p>
<p>Every time HP got caught doing something evil, they had the same excuse: "that's the deal we offered and you accepted it."</p>
<p>For example, if the box says "Works best with HP ink," then you are "agreeing" that it might not work with other ink. Nevermind that the only reason your printer doesn't work with other ink is that HP tricked you into downgrading it so that the ink stopped working.</p>
<p>This is the grifter's all-purpose excuse: "If you didn't want me to rip you off, then why did you click 'I agree'?"</p>
<p>HP was just getting started, though. In the ideal world, you wouldn't even own your printer ink, you'd just <em>rent</em> it.</p>
<p>Enter HP Instant Ink.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c03760650">https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c03760650</a></p>
<p>This  is "ink as a service." You pre-commit to printing a certain number of pages/month and they mail you ink, which they own. You're not buying the ink, you're buying the right to use it.</p>
<p>If you don't print your quota in a month, some of the pages roll over, but they don't let you bank more than a few months' worth – and to keep those pages, you have to keep paying for your sub. Meanwhile, if you blow through your limit, you get charged for every page.</p>
<p>This is a weird and unpalatable idea, so to sell it, HP rolled out a pay-on-price "Free Ink for Life" plan that gave you 15 pages every month for as long as you owned your printer.</p>

<p>But this is HP we're talking about, so words have no meaning. Last month, HP notified its "free ink for life" customers that their life had ended, and they were being moved to a new afterlife where they had to pay $0.99/month, forever, or else.</p>

<p>This Darth Vader "Pray I don't alter it further" shit is the most on-brand HP thing ever</p>
<p>Worse still are the many imitators HP inspires – all those companies that have decided that it's your solemn duty to arrange your affairs to suit their shareholders' needs.</p>
<p>The right-to-repair criminals like Apple, John Deere and Medtronic. Tesla and GM, Juicero and Keurig – companies that are not merely content with waging war on customers, but also on competitors who offer those customers shelter.</p>
<p>Since the turn of this century, HP has been shedding its productive business units that make useful products, and focusing its legal and engineering departments on innovations in shitty dystopian hack-futurism.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, security researcher Ryan Castellucci published a blog post with a somewhat provocative title: <em><a href="https://rya.nc/dkim-privates.html">DKIM: Show Your Privates</a></em>.</p>



<p>After reading the ensuing discussions on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24972609">Hacker News</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201104135629/https://old.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/jmv4qd/dkim_show_your_privates/gb0h87a/?context=9">Reddit</a> about their DKIM post, it seems clear that the importance of <strong>deniability</strong> in online communications seems to have been broadly overlooked.</p>



<h2>Security Goals, Summarized</h2>







<p>When you design or implement any communications protocol, you typically have most or all of the following security goals:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: Only the intended recipients can understand the contents of a message (almost always achieved through encryption).</li><li><strong>Integrity</strong>: The message will be delivered without alterations; and if it is, the recipient will know to reject it.</li><li><strong>Availability</strong>: Authorized users will have access to the resources they need (i.e. a medium they can communicate through).</li></ul>



<p>However, you may also have one or more of the following security goals:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Authenticity</strong>: In a group communication protocol, you want to ensure you can validate which participant sent each message. This is loosely related to, yet independent from, integrity.</li><li><strong>Non-Repudiation</strong>: An extension of authenticity, wherein you cannot deny that you sent a message after you sent it; it’s provable that you sent it.</li><li><strong>Deniability:</strong> The complement to non-repudiation, wherein you can prove that you sent a message to your recipient, and then at a future time make it possible for other participants to have forged the message.</li></ul>



<p>It’s tempting to think of deniability as the opposite of non-repudiation, but in practice, you want messages to have authenticity for <em>at least</em> a brief period of time for both.</p>



<p>However, you cannot simultaneously have deniability and non-repudiation in a communication. They’re mutually exclusive concepts, even if they both build off authenticity. Hence, I call it a complement.</p>



<p>Off-The-Record messaging achieved deniability through publishing the signing key of the previous message with each additional message.</p>



<h2>Security Properties of DKIM</h2>



<p><a href="https://rya.nc/dkim-privates.html">Ryan Castellucci’s blog post</a> correctly observed that the anti-spam protocol DKIM, as used by most mail providers in 2020, incidentally also offers non-repudiation…even if that’s not <em>supposed to be</em> a primary goal of DKIM.</p>



<p>Non-repudiation can be bolted onto any protocol with long-term asymmetric cryptographic keys used to generate digital signatures of messages–which is exactly what DKIM does.</p>



<h3>Real World Case Study</h3>



<p>A while ago, the New York Post published a DKIM-signed email from someone claiming to be named Vadym Pozharskyi to Hunter Biden–son of the presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden. </p>



<p>Because the DKIM public keys used by Gmail during that time period are known–but <em>not</em> the private keys–it’s possible to authenticate that the emails came from Gmail and is a valid email. And someone <a href="https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/hunter-dkim">did exactly this</a>.</p>



<p>In a similar vein, if someone wanted to embarrass an executive at a large company, accessing their colleagues’ email and leaking messages would be sufficient, since DKIM could be used to verify that the emails are authentic.</p>



<h3>Deniability in DKIM</h3>



<p>Ryan’s proposal for introducing deniability in DKIM was to routinely rotate signing keys and publish fragments of their old DKIM private keys (which are RSA keys) so that anyone can reconstruct the private key after-the-fact.</p>



<p>This kind of deniability is mostly to mitigate against the harm of data leaks–such as your friend’s laptop getting stolen and someone trying to lambaste you on social media for an email you sent 10+ years ago–rather than provide a legal form of deniability. (We’re cryptography nerds, not lawyers.)</p>



<p>If the laptop theft scenario took place, with DKIM, someone can cryptographically <strong>prove</strong> you sent the email at a specific time to your friend with a specific body, because it’s signed by (presumably Gmail’s) DKIM keys.</p>



<p>Conversely, if you had used an email provider that practiced what Ryan proposed (rotating/publishing the private key at a regular interval), they couldn’t cryptographically prove anything. If the past private keys are public, anyone could have come along and forged the DKIM signature.</p>



<h2>On Post-Compromise Security</h2>



<p>The concept of <strong>Post-Compromise Security</strong> is somewhat related to deniability (but affects confidentiality rather than integrity or authenticity):</p>



<p>If someone successfully compromises one participant in a private discussion group, and their access is discovered, can the rest of the participants recover from this breach and continue to have privacy for future conversations?</p>



<p>It’s easy to see how the concepts are related.</p>



<ul><li>Deniability offers short-term authenticity followed by a long-term break in authenticity.</li><li>Post-Compromise Security offers long-term confidentiality even if there’s a short-term break in confidentiality.</li></ul>



<p>Robust private messaging protocols–such as what the IETF is trying to provide with <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-mls-protocol/">Message Layer Security</a>–would ideally offer both properties to their users.</p>



<p>Past attempts to build non-repudiation (through “message franking”) on top of cipher constructions like <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">AES-GCM</a> led to a class of attacks known affectionately as Invisible Salamanders, based on the title of the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016">relevant research paper</a>.</p>



<h2>In Conclusion</h2>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apropos of nothing, I really wish Gmail would start publishing its expired DKIM secret keys.</p>— Matthew Green (@matthew_d_green) <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/1323011619069321216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>It might seem really weird for cryptographers to want large-scale email providers to publish their expired DKIM secret keys, but when you understand the importance of deniability in past private communications, it’s a straightforward thing to want.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting: Some security experts will push back on this, because they work in computer forensics, and making DKIM deniable would theoretically make their job slightly more difficult. </p>



<p>Keep their self-interest in mind when they’re complaining about this notion, since the proposal is <strong>not</strong> to publish non-expired DKIM secret keys, and therefore it would not make spam more challenging to combat.</p>

                <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Last Friday (Oct 31, 2020 🎃) we were among the first startups to graduate from 500 Startups’ fully virtual accelerator program.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I’ve had a lot of people ask me about what 500 Startups is like now that it’s remote, so I figured I’d write about my experience.</p>
<p>If you are considering joining the program yourself or have specific questions, feel free to <a href="mailto:bethany@sendspark.com" target="_self">reach out to me directly</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>What is new about 500 Startups?</strong></h2>
<p>In March 2020, 500 Startups announced two big changes to their model:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>It’s remote</strong> - so all meetings, programming, social events are now virtual</li>
<li><strong>It’s rolling</strong> - so startups enter and graduate at different times</li>
</ol>
<p>You can read more about why they made these changes on <a href="https://500.co/blog/taking-our-flagship-accelerator-virtual-first/" target="_self">their blog</a>.</p>
<p>When we were considering joining 500 Startups, we had mixed feelings about these changes.</p>
<p>They clearly offer a lot more flexibility to the startups. We could time the program and our Demo Day for when it made the most sense for our business and we did not have to relocate ourselves from San Antonio, Texas, to San Francisco.</p>
<p>However, we also worried about “missing out” on social components. There is something to be said for dropping ~70 founders building companies in the same room for four months, and letting organic relationships blossom.</p>
<h2><strong>Our goals for Sendspark</strong></h2>
<p>For context, this is where our heads were at when we were making the decision to join 500 Startups:</p>
<p>It was late May 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic wasn’t exactly new, but it was just starting to sink in that it wasn’t temporary. Businesses were just starting to update their strategies to take into account that they would be working remote for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we were an early-stage video company that wanted to help!</p>
<p>Sendspark is a video messaging platform that helps businesses engage customers with personalized video messages. Users can easily <a href="https://www.sendspark.com/video-platform/record-videos" target="_self">record videos</a> from their web browser to share with customers in email, LinkedIn messages, website chatbots, or any other professional communication channel. Users can also <a href="https://www.sendspark.com/video-platform/request-videos" target="_self">request videos</a> from customers to get feedback, support issues, or customer testimonials.</p>
<p>We saw that we could help sales, marketing, and support teams bridge the gap to connect with customers online.</p>
<p>But, we were just barely too early to take advantage of the situation. We were missing key product features (like screen recording 🤦‍♀️), nearly all of our network was in San Antonio, Texas, and we did not have the capital to just “give everything away for free to gain market share” like some of our competitors.</p>
<p>And then we received <a href="https://share.sendspark.com/view/jahgk4ffvz3hwre5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this video email</a> from the 500 Startups team...</p>
<p><a href="https://share.sendspark.com/view/jahgk4ffvz3hwre5" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://blog.sendspark.com/hs-fs/hubfs/500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif?width=704&amp;name=500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif" alt="500 Startups Acceptance Email" width="704" srcset="https://blog.sendspark.com/hs-fs/hubfs/500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif?width=352&amp;name=500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif 352w, https://blog.sendspark.com/hs-fs/hubfs/500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif?width=704&amp;name=500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif 704w, https://blog.sendspark.com/hs-fs/hubfs/500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif?width=1056&amp;name=500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif 1056w, https://blog.sendspark.com/hs-fs/hubfs/500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif?width=1408&amp;name=500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif 1408w, https://blog.sendspark.com/hs-fs/hubfs/500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif?width=1760&amp;name=500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif 1760w, https://blog.sendspark.com/hs-fs/hubfs/500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif?width=2112&amp;name=500%20Startups%20Acceptance%20Email.gif 2112w" sizes="(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"></a>So, we decided that if 500 Startups was willing to make a bet on us, then we’d take a bet on them and their new virtual accelerator modal.</p>
<p>These were goals we discussed as a team as we started onboarding:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Complete the team </strong>- make sure we were capable of iterating fast to stay ahead of the quickly-changing market</li>
<li><strong>Complete the product </strong>- build a super sticky product that people LOVED</li>
<li><strong>Grow market share</strong> - make sure that Sendspark was the #1 choice for businesses when they looked for video tools for customer communication</li>
<li><strong>Expand our network</strong> - meet thought leaders and work with the best customers, mentors, and investors, wherever they were in the world</li>
<li><strong>Raise Seed funding</strong> - So that we could afford to hire the best team, build the best product, and reach the best customers.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>The 500 Startups Virtual Experience </strong></h2>
<p>The theme of 500 Startups’ new remote, rolling model is that they personalize the experience for each of their startups.</p>
<p>This is what programming looked like for us:</p>
<h3><strong>500 Startups Required Programming:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weekly standup (~1 hr / wk)</strong> - every Tuesday, we’d have a standup with all founders in-program to share what we’re working on, and make asks to other people in the batch. These meetings were great for learning from other founders and exchanging advice.</li>
<li><strong>Investment lead meetings (~1hr / wk) </strong>- every Friday, we’d meet with our investment lead to update her on our progress, make sure we were staying true to our goals, and get her feedback on how we could progress faster.</li>
<li><strong>EIR meetings (~1.5hrs / wk)</strong> - twice a week, we’d meet with our EIR (entrepreneur in residence), who would work with us to build an incredibly personalized growth plan. We hand selected our EIR at the beginning of 500 Startups to find one with experience in our industry, and building product-led growth companies. These meetings were critical for learning new ways to grow, and keeping us honest that we were running growth experiments.</li>
<li><strong>Written investor updates (~30 min / wk)</strong> - Every Friday (or Saturday, or Sunday, depending on how busy the week was), we’d send a short investor update to the 500 Startups investment team, and other investors in Sendspark through <a href="https://www.visible.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visible.vc</a>. This was a quick way to keep everyone up to state, and keep track of our progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Optional Programming:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guest speakers &amp; webinars (~1-4 hrs per wk)</strong> - there were usually around 4 webinars per week with guest speakers. We were encouraged to only attend the ones that were relevant to us. I usually attended one of the four per week, or would watch while I ate lunch or took a break from work.</li>
<li><strong>Social events (~1 hr / wk) </strong>-</li>
<li>we tried to do at least one “happy hour” per week. As these were at different times for all the founders in the program (9am for SF, 12pm for me, and evening for Europe), they weren’t usually centered around drinking, but more getting-to-know you games, trivia, and other icebreakers.</li>
<li><strong>Mentor requests (~1 hr / wk)</strong> - 500 Startups has an incredible network of mentors. As a founder, you can either request to meet with a specific mentor, or just put out a general ask to be matched with a mentor. We were blown away by the quality of mentors and advice we received here. Now that the official programming is over for us and my calendar has a little more free time, I intend to take double advantage of the mentor network</li>
<li><strong>Pitch practice (~8hrs / 4 mos) - </strong>The pitch practice is only around pitch events &amp; Demo Days, but super helpful when needed.</li>
<li><strong>Investor office hours (~8hrs / 4 mos) - </strong>Investors have office hours throughout the program, which is a great way to meet investors and get feedback before actually programming.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.sendspark.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Blog%20-%20500%20remote%20first%20accelerator.png" alt="500 Startups Batch 27 Founders"></p>
<h3><strong>Additional Events:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sales Bootcamp </strong>- This was a mini bootcamp designed to help us nail our selling strategy. We spent 3 day refining our target market, value proposition, and outreach strategy. At the end, we launched an outbound email campaign (featuring a Sendspark video) and landed our biggest customer at the time.</li>
<li><strong>“Sneak Peak” Pitch Event </strong>- We had a “sneak peak” pitch event, which was a bit of a practice Demo Day. This gave us a chance to work on our pitch and get tons of feedback &amp; introductions to investors before the Demo Day.</li>
<li><strong>VC Unlocked </strong>- This is a separate program that 500 Startups also runs, which helps emerging VC fund managers accelerate their careers. 500 Startups founders met with some of the VCU students, so that we could both practice investor conversations.</li>
<li><strong>Demo Day</strong> - For us, Demo Day is not until February, so I can’t speak much on this here. However, I will say that our team really appreciated that Demo Day was not the big focus on the 500 startups program. Instead, we spent the four months focused on building our company.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>My thoughts on the 500 Startups virtual programming</strong></h3>
<p>500 Startups does a great job on making sure that we have all of the programming and check-ins we need, without overdoing it. Very few events are required, and the ones that are, like the Investment Lead and EIR meetings, are hyper-personalized to our company, so they are incredibly valuable.</p>
<h2><strong>Shoutout to especially amazing people</strong></h2>
<p>As I’m writing this, I can’t resist giving special shoutouts to the people who made 500 Startups experience exceptional for us:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicahtan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jess Tan</a> for believing in us early on, and being there every step of the way as our investment lead.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/timurdaudpota?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Timur Daudpota</a>, for being the best EIR we could have asked for. He pushed us just the right amount, and was instrumental in our growth.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahstaatz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Staatz</a>, took the reigns of program manager right as our program began. She dove head first into the fire, and was a constant source of energy and positivity throughout the program.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danlevin1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dan Levin</a> was our “buddy,” and despite being the president of multi-million dollar company, took time to meet with us every two weeks to answer every question we wouldn’t have thought to ask</li>
<li>The other investment leads (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kateseledets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kate</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nkhera/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neha</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/claytonbryan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clayton</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amit-s-bhatti-1o1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amit</a>) who were always there for pitch practice and all kinds of advice</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/timchae/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Chae</a> for dropping all of the knowledge bombs and new perspectives for thinking about things</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ablumey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aaron Blumenthal</a> for being a wealth of knowledge for all things growth and fundraising - and never holding back his advice</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalieriso/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natalie</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zinamoukheiber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zina</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tracybarba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tracy</a> on the 500 Startups Marketing team for going above and beyond to use and promote Sendspark</li>
<li>The previous batch alums for always making time for in-program founders when we had questions</li>
<li>The mentors for going above and beyond to dig deep and think through tough problems with us.</li>
<li>All of the <a href="https://500.co/blog/meet-the-startups-in-500s-first-fully-virtual-accelerator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Batch 27 founders</a> with us (too many to list here), for always providing ideas and support</li>
<li>And a special shout out to <a href="https://app.pineappleapp.io/userStory/ijzL7PdqiPfH9oFdoH7J" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David</a> and <a href="https://app.pineappleapp.io/userStory/7TOvg50rlPSCZB2ebFj2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ollie</a> from <a href="https://www.pineappleapp.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pineapple</a> for featuring me in their marketing video 🤩</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>So, did we hit our initial 500 Startups goals?</strong></h2>
<p>Yes! Between May and now, we made huge progress on all of our goals:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Team</strong></h3>
<p>Perfecting our team was our first focus for 500 Startups. We hired an exceptional CTO, and offered our incredible part-time software developers full-time positions. We also hired a content marketing intern to help us create customer welcome videos (using Sendspark!) and blog content.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Product</strong></h3>
<p>After Team, our next focus was Product. High level, our goal was to “build a product people love.”</p>
<p>Our KPIs have been mostly around usage and retention.</p>
<p>Specifically, we were looking at…</p>
<ul>
<li>How many new sign ups successfully record and share videos?</li>
<li>How many videos are people recording per week?</li>
<li>What is …</li></ul></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

          <p>Codelitt is a remote-first digital product firm that specializes in UX design, development and strategy. During my time here, I’ve learned a lot about human nature and taken note of how my remote peers impressed me. Hopefully these insights are helpful to you!</p><p>Alright, let’s get started!</p><h2 id="communicate">Communicate</h2><p>Ever wondered how to rally your colleagues around your idea so that it gets implemented? Here are a few tips on how to write a nice message that will speak to your peers from around the world.</p><h3 id="don-t-assume-people-s-knowledge">Don’t assume people’s knowledge</h3><p>Essentially, don’t think they know <em>this </em>or <em>that </em>just because you do.</p><ul><li><strong>Don’t</strong>: “Hey, I noticed we could use a <strong>HOTP</strong>, returned by the <strong>tuple</strong> of the <em>create</em> endpoint...”</li><li><strong>Do</strong>: “Hey, I noticed we could use a <strong>HMAC-based One-time Password (HOTP)</strong>, returned by the object (<strong>tuple</strong>) of the <em>create</em> endpoint...”<br></li></ul><h3 id="write-a-clear-context">Write a clear context</h3><p>The idea is to understand how you came to think about it.</p><p><em>Example</em>: "Hey guys, I noticed POTATO is not really matching our needs because of X and Y, what if we try APPLE instead? [<em>explanation continued</em>]"</p><h3 id="describe-your-idea-in-the-clearest-and-concise-way-possible">Describe your idea in the clearest and concise way possible</h3><p>Opt for short sentences. Don't use a ton of punctuation. Avoid too much emphasis. You'll lose your audience's understanding. You can use <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">http://www.hemingwayapp.com/</a> to help you catch difficult sentences before you send them. Use images when possible.</p><ul><li><strong>Don’t</strong>: At the moment, the spaceship is broken and lost around Centaurus XII, which could cause some trouble in our communication system, <strong>consequently,</strong> this is <strong>potentially</strong> and <strong>irreversibly</strong> making us lose the faith of our people, <strong>which,</strong> as you might recall<strong>,</strong> is already damn low <strong>and</strong> will<strong> (undoubtedly)</strong>, be reflected badly in the next election turn if we don’t act now.</li><li><strong>Do</strong>: &nbsp;At the moment, the spaceship is broken and lost around Centaurus XII. This is damaging our communication system. Because of this situation, our people are losing faith in us. This will be reflected badly in the next election turn if we don’t act now.<br></li></ul><h3 id="write-the-goals">Write the goals</h3><p>Explain what you hope to achieve by the proposed idea.</p><p><em>Example</em>: By doing this, the main goal is to improve our response time by at least 30%.</p><p><em>Example</em>: So by doing this refactoring this would save everyone ~10 minutes (the time I measured when doing this) because the task will now be automated.<br></p><h3 id="write-the-expectations">Write the expectations</h3><p>What do you expect from your peers after reading your message?</p><ul><li>Do you want them to acknowledge they have read it?</li><li>Do you want them to take action?</li><li>Do you want them to discuss it for future implementation?</li></ul><p>If you don’t let them know, your message might fall into the forgotten realm and will never be discussed</p><p><em>Example</em>: Please acknowledge this message once you have read it with a ✅<br><em>Example</em>: Please let’s discuss if this idea would be possible in the thread. I expect we could also plan it if that looks like a good idea.<br><em>Example</em>: Please, let’s discuss this as soon as you have time, as the situation is quite urgent.<br></p><figure><img src="https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hepw4b4yn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/How-to-impress-as-a--remote--software-engineer-1.png" alt="clear slack messages for leadership and team management"></figure><h3 id="use-paragraph-and-different-format-to-separate-points-of-concern">Use paragraph and different format to separate points of concern</h3><div><p>Use <strong>bold, </strong><em>italics<strong>, </strong></em>- bullet points<em>, </em>[code block]<br>Use <em>any</em> tool your message editor provides to make your message more readable</p><p>	<em>Example</em>:<br>	In order to X and Y, we need to follow these steps:</p></div><ol><li>Do X</li><li>Do Y <em>and this if you are on Windows</em></li><li>Add [code block] in your config file<br></li></ol><h3 id="-use-emojis-when-you-have-to-convey-feelings-">♥️ Use emojis when you have to convey feelings ♥️</h3><p>I really love programming with Visual Basic. &lt;- Is this true? Is this ironic? Let your team know! If you don’t let colleagues know your intentions in a more serious situation, then you might unintentionally hurt some feelings if they don't know you (and your <em>amazing</em> sense of humor) well.<br></p><p>I really do love programming with Visual Basic 🤪😂<br></p><h3 id="read-your-finished-message-as-if-you-were-one-of-your-peers">Read your finished message as if you were one of your peers</h3><p>Adjust it accordingly, do it as many time as you want for better results.</p><div><p><em>Example Context</em>: I am proposing an idea to the frontend (FE) team, but they don’t really know how the backend (BE) works. Let’s put ourselves in my FE peers' shoes and imagine which of these two messages they'd rather receive.</p><p>1. "Hey dear FE team 😘! We saw that you could benefit from the CI/CD system we've built for our BE. Let us know if you are interested!"</p><p>2. "Hey guys! We recently built this amazing CI/CD system, it uses X and Y <em>(to know more, here is the link to our documentation)</em>. By following those simple steps, you can easily use the system which might improve your CI/CD speed:</p></div><ul><li>Do X</li><li>Do Y</li><li>And docker this</li><li>And container that</li><li>And Makefile blah blah</li><li>And [input trendy word here 😬]</li></ul><p>Please let us know if you are interested. We're available to answer any questions. - &nbsp;- Your devoted BE team 😘"</p><p>The second message is much more clear and helpful. It is direct and addresses questions the FE team might have. This allows them to iterate upon it without confusion, leaving a strong impact within their hearts. They will remember how eloquent you are!</p><h2 id="ask-questions-">Ask questions!</h2><p>You have doubts? Ask. You don’t know? Ask. Most of the time you will realize that your team doesn’t know either!</p><p>Continuing in a direction where you have doubts and misunderstanding will make your colleagues grumpy and your results won’t be up to the expectations. In this situation, nobody wins - not you, not the person expecting you to finish your work.</p><h2 id="be-simple">Be simple</h2><p>Ever read a book with an exaggerated style? You suddenly realize you’ve been reading descriptions for 2 pages and yet you're still not able to figure out what the scene is actually about? That’s <em>exactly </em>what’s happening when your code is not relevant to the context of the project’s scope.</p><p><strong>Simplicity is hard.</strong> Simplicity is having a clear idea of the requirements with a straightforward implementation and avoiding tons of useless overthinking. It's keeping the code flexible enough to be easily understandable, rewritten or extended. All of this while keeping the cognitive overhead 'light', is <strong><em>hard</em></strong>. </p><p>Achieving simplicity demonstrates the ability to see clearly through a complex problem while keeping in my mind the whole picture of the project.</p><p>In all, presenting an over-engineered solution, or “a rocket that kills ants” as my colleague Diogo elegantly says, only flatters your ego. It doesn’t demonstrate a clear understanding of the application, the problem it solves, or its requirements. In the end, you will make your peers' days worse, as they will have to deal with this solution or spend a lot of time reviewing your PRs. Nobody wins. </p><p>On the other hand, presenting a very simple but elegant solution that everybody understands will not only make your own life easier, but also make your goal achievable.</p><figure><img src="https://res-2.cloudinary.com/hepw4b4yn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/How-to-impress-as-a--remote--software-engineer-1-1.png" alt="emojis to help you communicate better"></figure><h2 id="be-humble">Be humble</h2><p>Humility is taking feedback, appreciating what your peers do better than you, and helping them when they need it. It's essential for your own improvement as a colleague and as a software engineer.</p><p>Your company doesn't make money from your ego! You’ll be more valuable if you take feedback as challenges to overcome, rather than personal attacks. Once those challenges are no more, you are already more valuable :)</p><p>Your company, your peers, your projects, and you yourself evolve. Everything is changing constantly. Staying humble makes you more aware of those changes. Be more conscious and intentional about how you communicate with and perceive others. This helps you be more precise and in tune with your personal goals as well as the team's at any moment in time. It's the key to staying more open-minded and being able to see things differently.</p><h2 id="own-your-mistakes">Own your mistakes</h2><p>The art of taking ownership of your mistakes is amazing. If I’ve made a mistake, I make my team aware of it. Everybody knows what’s going on then and they might even want to help. If you own your mistake, the consequences are never as severe as if you'd tried to hide it. Everybody can have a bad day, and that’s okay. The more you hide your faults, the more severely you'll be judged as time passes and things get worse! If everybody in the team shares the mistakes they've made, it creates an environment of support and solutions that is productive, safe and positive for you and your team.</p><h2 id="to-conclude">To conclude</h2><p>As time passes you will hopefully learn those soft skills by yourself. So learn as much as you can. The more you learn, the more you will see that the things you know are connected. This will improve your creativity in solving problems, finding elegant solutions, understanding others and communicating!</p><p>If there are three things to keep from this article they are: </p><ul><li><strong>Be open-minded </strong></li><li><strong>Learn </strong></li><li><strong>Be empathetic</strong></li></ul><p>You will impress in ways you don’t expect.</p>

10 Different Types of Developers You’re Likely to Find </h2>

<p><span>I’ve met many types of developers throughout the years building different products with <a href="https://altar.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Altar.io</a>. </span><span>The one important lesson I’ve learnt along the way is:</span></p>
<blockquote id="33ac">
<p><strong>Don’t look for the perfect developers, look for a balanced&nbsp;team.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s our sweet spot for one reason: there is no such thing as perfection and <strong>building a good product is never a one-man-show</strong>.</p>
<p><span>Creating and keeping a balanced dev team is a very challenging art. This is due to these two characteristics of developers: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Generally speaking, they are not the most skilled communicators</span></li>
<li><span>They tend to be fiercely competitive, especially when it comes to tests of intellect.</span></li>

<p><span>The Average Coder is perhaps <strong>the most common</strong> type of developer. He might sell himself in different ways, but he tends to be average in everything he does – with the exception of gaming. He has <strong>average standards</strong> and <strong>mediocre ambition</strong>, he wants a <strong>predictable</strong> workflow in his <strong>backlog</strong> to deliver it quietly and he’s not very keen on bug fixing because, in his point of view, that means moving back in his backlog.</span></p>

<p><b>Should you hire this developer?<br>
</b><span>Being the most common archetype, the Average Coder is the easiest to get in the market. Eventually, you’ll be hiring some Average Coders in your team. It’s important, however, that they don’t come aboard until your developer team is at least 20-strong.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong>: we don’t have average coders at <a href="https://altar.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Altar.io</a>.</span></p>

<p><span>The Wolf is a <strong>dream developer</strong>, totally unbalanced and eternally optimistic. You will try to include him in all projects because he’s hyper-productive, codes very quickly and will never deliver less than solid code.</span></p>
<p>He makes <strong>great architecture decisions.</strong> He is always aware of the best practices and new technologies. Not only that he also already tried and benchmarked different architectural decisions – before he presents the solution to be adopted.</p>
<p>He is a good team player, talks when necessary and understands and respects business and product decisions. Is he/she a problem solver? Well, you’ll never be worried when one is around because <strong>things will be solved</strong>. These types of developers also have the rare ability to read your mind and predict your needs, which is kind of weird but indeed handy.</p>

<div>
<p><b>Should you hire The Wolf?<br>
</b><span><strong>Positively!</strong> You should find all the Wolves in town but sadly there aren’t many.</span><span><br>
</span><span>Unlike 80% of developers, The Wolf understands business and product priorities – even if they don’t meet his dream roadmap. He’ll try to help as much as possible to get the team together to achieve your goals. Only 1 developer out of 1000 is probably a Wolf</span><span>.</span><span> We have a good eye for Wolves, so we proudly have more than a few working at <a href="https://altar.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Altar.io</a>.</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><b>Warning if you consider hiring one:<br>
</b><span>Wolves are ambitious and constant learners, so their <strong>stability and loyalty will quickly disappear if they’re not feeling stimulated</strong> with projects or by their peers. They also tend to be optimistic in their judgement of projects and have difficulty saying ‘no’ – so sometimes they’ll accept work and timelines that are nearly impossible to achieve.</span></p>

<p><span>This type of developer is very <strong>similar to The Wolf.</strong> However, he comes with significant differences that have a tremendous impact – possession of a much <strong>bigger ego</strong> and <strong>poorer communication</strong> and team skills.</span></p>
<p>While most developers are highly competitive, the Narcissus takes it to a higher level. He wants to be recognized as a genius to the point that he often falls in his own trap: he <strong>tends to over-engineer</strong> simple things to create the “perfect systems” and <strong>refuses to compromise.</strong> He always refactors code to be fully irrepressible even if this takes 1000% of the expected time and even if it is not exactly what you wanted.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, he goes with Maximus motto: “<strong>What we do in life, echoes in eternity!</strong>” The best way to manage a Narcissus is to present them with a very specific challenge and discuss the solution in detail. Just like the Wolf, they’ll find the best solution, within budget and in a very reasonable timeframe. He is a nice chap and tends to be smooth with his fellow developers – although he often recreates their code to openly display who’s in charge.</p>

<p><b>Should you hire this developer?<br>

<p><b>Warning if you consider hiring one:<br>
</b><span>If you give him big challenges and let him decide alone he will over-engineer as much as he can, because he wants to appear as the one-man-maestro that architectured and executed a masterpiece alone.</span></p>

<p><span>Mickey is an Idealist, he only thinks about solutions in a quintessential form and has a very <strong>limited capability to compromise</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>He proposes to adopt a new framework/architecture because the project will be more modular and scalable.</span></p>
<p><span>He wants to migrate the whole system to this new standard. He will disrespect the fact that it doesn’t have a meaningful community yet. He also won’t care that his peers will not know how to work with it.</span></p>
<p><span>Discussions about budget and timings will be rebuffed with arguments about how vital it is that their preference is chosen – and that you’d understand why “if you had vision”.</span></p>

<p>With the correct structure around them, they might make a difference, finding the best architectural option that no one else thought about.</p>
<p><b>Warning if you consider hiring one:<br>
</b><span>He likes to bring disruption but <strong>you’ll need to moderate the speed of new adoption</strong>. When you challenge his ideas for change, he’ll endlessly argue with you to try to prove he’s correct: It’s important to remember while the facts and figures they’ll sprout are correct (i.e. faster, more scalable, more modular, etc) it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a good idea to adopt it at this stage.</span></p>
<p>Also remember, if you aren’t using the latest – and riskier – technologies, they’ll soon lose interest in the project. If they have the space to shine they will be loyal – but otherwise don’t expect too much commitment to you or the project.</p>

<p><b>Warning if you consider hiring one:<br>
</b><span>He will tease the idealist and the puritan on a daily basis. Also, you should never put him alone developing a big feature because he does not follow the standards or documentation. While their code will (somehow) work, it will be difficult for their peers to understand and change. </span></p>
<p><span>Hitchhikers are normally loyal by default but highly unstable – the result of which means if they receive a better offer, they’ll be out the door.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Using ML models to predict and solve business use cases currently is a very lengthy and iterative process. Data scientists and engineers need to tackle a lot of challenges continuously, from building and improving the models to deploying them and using them in production applications for tangible utility. A significant amount of time and energy is spent on development, deployment, and maintenance which otherwise could be better used in training and improving the models.</p>
<p>We are today releasing two new features in dstack that we believe is a first step for us to improve the situation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Push and pull models directly from Python to build a model registry</li>
<li>Schedule jobs written in Python to run models against live data</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604665792741/_QMzQm0hc.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="dstack workflow.jpeg"></p>
<p>Here’s the description of the steps shown in the diagram:</p>
<ol>
<li>The data scientist pushes the trained model to the dstack’s model registry from a Jupyter notebook, a script, or any ML Ops solution.</li>
<li>The data scientist creates a job on the dstack server.</li>
<li>The job pulls the model from the dstack’s model registry.</li>
<li>The job loads the data from a data warehouse, and pass the data to the model.</li>
<li>The job makes plots and pushes them into dstack as reports.</li>
<li>The business user accesses the report on the dstack’s server.</li>
</ol>
<p>These new features combined with the existing ability to build interactive data reports with Python and other open-source libraries (see  <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.dstack.ai/dstackai-is-now-open-source-an-easy-way-to-build-data-applications">open-source announcement</a> ) will simplify the creation of interactive data applications for business-specific use cases (e.g., modeling, pricing, revenue prediction, controlling KPIs, manufacturing issues and others.)</p>
<h2 id="push-and-pull-ml-models-to-dstack-model-registry">Push and pull ML models to dstack Model Registry</h2>
<p>The ability to push and pull models to dstack Model Registry with the Python API enables one to decouple model development from application development. You can now host your models within the dstack Model Registry in the same way that you host your docker images in the docker registry.</p>
<p>It’s as simple as training the model and pushing it to dstack to then pull it later from the dstack server. This provides an idiomatic approach for versioning and managing different instances of your model. In addition, this enables you to isolate model creation from model consumption. Currently, dstack supports models made with Tensorflow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.</p>
<p>Let’s say you want to build an application to predict the churn of your customers to be used by sales. In this toy example, let’s build this model, and push this model to dstack Model Registry. 
We start by importing the libraries required - scikit-learn and pandas to create ML models, and dstack to push/pull the model. </p>
<pre><code>




model = LogisticRegression() 
result = model.fit(X_train, y_train)

prediction_test = model.predict(X_test)
</code></pre>
<p>Once your model is trained and ready, you can push it to dstack Model Registry simply using the ds.push function. </p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> dstack <span>as</span> ds

ds.push(<span>"churn_demo/lr_model"</span>, model, “Some description of your model”)
</code></pre>
<p>The first argument of the function <em>ds.push</em> is the name of the stack which stores the ML model in the dstack server. </p>
<p>Notice how we used the ds.push function to push the ML model <em>churn_demo/lr_model</em> and store it in dstack Model Registry. As you continue to work on the model, you can also repeatedly push the improved model to dstack which will track all versions of the model. </p>
<p>If you want to retrieve this model later on – to share it with others or to use it in a Python application, you can pull it back from dstack the following way: </p>
<pre><code>my_model = ds.pull(<span>"churn_demo/lr_model"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, you’ll get the same instance of the <em>LinearRegression</em> model which you pushed to Model Registry. Once you’ve pulled the model, you can use it right away. </p>
<p>You can also pull a specific revision of the model using the revision ID or a parameter value: e.g.,  </p>
<pre><code>my_model = ds.pull(<span>"churn_demo/lr_model"</span>, params={<span>"someParam"</span>: someValue, <span>"someOtherParam"</span>: someOtherValue})
</code></pre>
<p>The model itself is stored on the dstack server in the format based on the type and the framework used to create the model. This can be either weights or pickled objects. You can control the API if both options are available. Here is how the pushed model looks like  <a target="_blank" href="https://dstack.ai/riwaj/churn_demo/lr_model">https://dstack.ai/riwaj/churn_demo/lr_model
</a>. You can also find the screenshot of the Model Registry below.  </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604670407744/u8IUifQeY.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Model registry.png"></p>
<h2 id="schedule-jobs-to-run-ml-models-on-live-data">Schedule jobs to run ML models on live data</h2>
<p>Now, imagine that you want to call your model regularly on the enterprise data – e.g. to build an interactive data report. In this case, you can create a dstack Job to run this code at a regular schedule. To do this, you can go to the “Jobs” tab in your dstack server application.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604668265473/8xkzM9_QI.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="jobs screen shot.png"></p>
<p>You’ll see a light code editor where you can post the code of your job. The job will query the enterprise data (e.g. from a data source, or a data warehouse), pull the ML model (by its name from the Model Registry), do prediction, pass it to a visualization library, and then push the resulted visualization or data to dstack to make an  <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.dstack.ai/publish-track-and-share-data-analysis-results-without-development-skills">interactive report</a>.</p>
<p>In the job, you can pull your model to use together with data and visualization libraries. </p>
<pre><code>loaded_model = ds.pull(<span>"churn_demo/lr_model"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Before passing the data to the model, you might filter and transform the data to make sure that the relevant data is used to build the interactive report. </p>
<pre><code>




y_pred = loaded_model.predict(X)
</code></pre>
<p>Also within your Jobs, you can use the dstack library to build an interactive report. The dstack library allows you to pass parameters with every visualization or data frame. Once pushed, multiple visualizations and data frames within a single stack, are automatically compiled into an interactive application where the user may change parameters and see the report updating accordingly. </p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> dstack <span>as</span> ds

frame = ds.frame(<span>"churn_demo/app"</span>)



frame.add(y1_pred, params={ <span>"Region"</span>: reg, <span>"Month"</span>: mon,
                      <span>"Churn Prediction"</span>: ds.tab() })


frame.push()
</code></pre>
<p>In our toy example, we use the following dstack’s functions above. </p>
<ol>
<li>ds.frame defines the name of the application, in this case, <em>churn_demo/app</em>. </li>
<li>frame.add offers the UI rules for the application. You can see how parameters like ‘Region’, and ‘Month’ are passed to the frontend to create interactivity in the report. </li>
<li>frame.push pushes the frame to the server where the report is rendered. </li>
</ol>
<p>Notice how a function <em>ds.tab</em> was added to the frame to define a tab “Churn Prediction”. This function enables you to have a multi-page report. </p>
<p>For the sake of this simple example, let us assume that in our report apart from “Churn Prediction”, we also want to have another tab with a visualization, e.g. of the number of licenses purchased by a selected customer per recent month. To have it, we’ll create a plot, define a new tab using <em>ds.tab</em>, and then add it as an attachment within the same frame, and push the frame to dstack. </p>
<pre><code>



frame.add(fig, params={“Company”: company, “Licenses”ds.tab()})

frame.push()
</code></pre>
<p>Once you wrote the code of your job, you can now configure how regularly you want to update the report.</p>

<p>With this, you can start the job by pressing on the Run button that is available on the top-right hand corner of your screen. 
Once the job has finished, you can see the report it has pushed in your stacks.</p>

<p>If you open your report <em>churn_demo/app</em> from our example, it will look like the following: </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604668609768/l03JJSJ1k.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="churn_app.png"></p>
<p>The user can use UI controls compiled out of the parameters (used in frame.push) to play with the report switch between tabs. </p>

<p>The dstack may help to use ML models and regular jobs to predict customer churn, lifetime value of a customer, dynamic pricing, identifying industrial issues, and many more.</p>
<p>Here is the application built for our toy example to predict the churn rate of some imaginary customers using synthetic data.  <a target="_blank" href="https://dstack.ai/riwaj/churn_demo/app">https://dstack.ai/riwaj/churn_demo/app</a> </p>

      <section>
        
          <p><time datetime="2019-07-05T00:00:00+00:00">July 5, 2019</time></p>
        
        
        
          <p><em>Websites at one time wore badges of honor, proving that their code was semantic. I think it's time we bring HTML badges back.</em></p>
        
        <p>There was a time on the Internet when websites wore badges of honor, declaring that their code was semantic and followed the W3C guidelines. The validators we used weren't great (and <i>still</i> aren't perfect) but they represented a community that took pride in caring about the quality of their work. I think it's time we bring HTML badges back.</p>

<h2 id="getting-the-flaws-out-of-the-way">Getting the flaws out of the way</h2>

<p>Of course, there were reasons why these badges slowly faded out of popularity. Some of the reasoning made sense, but most felt like a stretch in logic from my perspective. I always looked at it as a “the good outweighs the bad”.</p>

<p>Jukka Korpela’s post way back in 2003, <a href="http://jkorpela.fi/html/validation.html">HTML validation is a good tool but just a tool</a>, highlighted a lot of problems with relying so heavily on these HTML validators. I suggest you give it a read if this kind of thing interests you. I found it fascinating, even though I disagree with most of the points he makes.</p>

<p>Some negatives used to dismiss HTML badges:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The badge system is outdated</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Dismissing the worth of something based on how long it has been around is foolish. Many tools and frameworks are “outdated” but are still used to this day with great success.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>HTML5 doesn’t <em>require</em> validation</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Technically <em>no subset of HTML</em> requires validation - but developers should aim for it. The W3C validators perform a solid job of keeping a standard for web development, so by following a standard we can keep experiences consistent for users.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Validation is too formal</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>I believe in the ability to achieve your desired outcome based on almost any constraints. If a project leans you towards invalid or non-semantic structure to fulfill requirements, a better approach needs to be evaluated. We as developers tend to settle too quickly on the easiest option available to us.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Websites / web apps are just <em>too complex</em> to follow the W3C guidelines</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>I call <em>BS</em> on this argument. The complexity of a website should have nothing to do with keeping semantic standards. <em>This is your job.</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>It only exists to catch syntax errors</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>For the record, I still see this more of a positive take on using validators. Subtle and nuanced syntax mistakes can be easily overlooked by the human eye.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="nobody-puts-baby-badges-in-a-corner">“Nobody puts <del>baby</del> badges in a corner”</h2>

<p>A large of amount of designers / developers tend to forget that there are new people entering our industry everyday and they might not be as well versed in the basics of the web (HTML &amp; CSS specifically). Since so many newcomers start out with JavaScript frameworks or jump onto pre-existing projects, they don’t always grasp the core foundation of valid markup. Some frameworks even break basic standards for visuals or easier development environments - setting their initial expectations that ugly semantics is acceptable code. The ends justify the means, etc.</p>

<p>Guiding first-timers towards HTML validators let’s them rethink their structure when building products or at least give some forethought to their outputted code. We, the more <em>verteran</em> members of the community, have the knowledge of proper semantics since we grew our careers around this “trend”. We shouldn’t assume newbies have the same understanding. The basics are important.</p>

<h2 id="open-source-html5-badge">Open source HTML5 badge</h2>

<p>Since the W3C doesn’t officially produce any badges for HTML5 validation <sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, I’ve gone ahead and open sourced <code>SVG</code> and <code>PNG</code> versions of a badge based off the current W3C designs. You can see the two colored examples below (SVG):</p>

<p><img src="https://uglyduck.ca/public/html5-validator-badge.svg" alt="HTML5 Validator Badge">
<img src="https://uglyduck.ca/public/html5-validator-badge-blue.svg" alt="HTML5 Validator Badge Blue"></p>

<p>You can check out the Github repo: <a href="https://github.com/bradleytaunt/html5-valid-badge">HTML5 Valid Badge</a></p>

<p>If you decide to use these badges, be sure to link these images to your valid passing URL (<a href="https://html5.validator.nu/">html5.validator.nu</a>). You can see an example of the link in the footer of this website.</p>

<p>Please feel free to reach out and share your websites / projects that pass as valid HTML and include an HTML valid badge. I’d love to check them out!</p>

      </p>

    <p>Most businesses need to send an email from time to time. Marketing platforms aside, what if you want to send it on your terms? Here’s a table comparing the common choices for starting businesses and indie makers.</p>

<p>I looked at <strong>leading transactional email providers</strong> and tried to compare them in what they give you <strong>for free</strong>, what they cost per 10 000 emails/month, 20 000 emails/month, 50 000 emails/month, and for <strong>a dedicated IP address</strong>. It focuses on initial costs where the business is starting up. I am including a price for one milion emails for fun, profit, and growing B2C startups.</p>

<p>This table is put together in <strong>November 2020</strong>. Please let me know if this needs an update.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>The table compares limits and the minimum payment but does not compare other advantages of higher volumes. Some price points might already trigger a higher plan with more emails.</p>

<p><strong>Mailgun</strong>’s one dedicated IP address starts with the Foundation plan ($35) for 100k emails and up ($75). You might consider going for the growth plan ($80) already with 1000 email address validations included.</p>

<p><strong>SendGrid</strong> starts the email validation at $89.95, but only for 2500 emails.</p>

<p><strong>Postmark</strong> charges for dedicated IP address extra ($50), but for any volume.</p>

<p><strong>Mandrill</strong> is a transactional email service from Mailchimp. Transactional email is available as an add-on to Standard ($14.99) and Premium plans. I included the Standard plan for keeping 500 contacts). Charges extra for a dedicated IP address ($29.95) for any volume.</p>

<p><strong>Sendinblue</strong> offers discounts for yearly payments. Dedicated IP address are offered only in the Enterprise plan without published pricing.</p>

<p><strong>Pepipost</strong> has great pricing for higher volumes. The mentioned $25/month gives you actually 150000 emails. 1 million can be as cheap as $171 for paying yearly.</p>

<p><strong>Mailjet</strong> free offering inserts a logo. $398.95 gets you 900k, then you have to switch to the Enterprise plan.</p>

<p><strong>Amazon SES</strong> pricing can get little confusing like anything in AWS. 62000 free emails in a month are for projects hosted in Amazon EC2 without data transfer fees. In general, you pay $0.10 for every 1000 emails sent, $0.12 for 1GB of attachments, and transfers.</p>

<p>They are some more services out there to consider, but I wanted to start with something famous and solid. Let me know on Twitter what should I add to the list.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>At MeetLeet, we write <a href="https://signup.meetleet.com/">great technical resumes for free</a>, for any technology professional in the US or Canada with 2+ years of experience. As a result, we’ve learned a lot about writing technical resumes.</p><p>A great technical resume gets you ahead in your career. The way companies hire can seem mysterious and cryptic, but it’s not too complicated in reality. Companies have processes for how they hire, and just like any system, if you know the rules it’s easy to reverse engineer what you need to do.</p><p>To help a hiring manager make technology hires, a company typically has HR staff, and sometimes a recruiter. The software they use to track interviews or job applicants is called an Applicant Tracking System (ATS). MeetLeet writes a great technical resume that appeals to each of these audiences.</p><p>Here’s how.</p><h3>Professional headline </h3><p>The professional headline summarizes your role and level. For easy comprehension, it sums up your professional standing in a few words - a short phrase that serves as shorthand for your career. Great professional headlines include: </p><ul><li>“Passionate Open Source Engineer”,</li><li>“Top-performing BI Analyst”,</li><li>“Innovative Machine Learning Expert”,</li><li>“Successful Front-end Engineer”, or </li><li>“Dedicated DevOps Professional”. </li></ul><p>A clear professional headline helps you get seen by managers looking to hire professionals like you.</p><h3>Four job titles you’d accept</h3><p>After your professional headline, you’ll share four job titles you’d actually accept for your next job. These are not necessarily past roles or job titles you’ve already had. Instead, these are the job titles resume readers should consider you for in your next job. This may seem really obvious to you, but it’s not obvious to the HR staff or your future boss – help them out by documenting very clearly your intended path forward.</p><h3>Professional summary</h3><p>The next three lines of your professional summary describe your most important, most relevant attributes.</p><p>The second line of the professional summary is capabilities, skills, talents. These are your top 4 most differentiated skills in the market.  Highlight skills that indicate you’re ready for the 4 job titles listed above. </p><p>The third line covers performance. What types of achievements have you had that prove you have the skills and capabilities listed above? What specific factual details can you summarize here? (You’ll explain them in detail in the <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/how-to-write-bullet-points-for-a-technical-resume">bullet points </a>below.)</p><p>The fourth line covers career highlights - awards, promotions, truly distinguishing achievements or industry recognitions.</p><p>And please note, if you have less than 8 years of experience, we’ll typically collapse the professional summary from 4 lines into just 2.</p><h3>Work experience </h3><p>The most common mistake engineers make in their <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/how-to-write-bullet-points-for-a-technical-resume">work experience section</a> is copying and pasting their job description. The readers of your resume already know what the duties and responsibilities of a ‘software engineer’ or a ‘full-stack engineer’ are. So repeating them on your resume doesn’t help you. </p><p>What they are looking for instead is details about what did you actually achieve in the job? Why was your previous employer better because you were there? Did you reduce latency? Increase throughput? Shave seconds off loading time? Build a system that could handle more capacity? </p><p>For technologists, this is an area where resumes actually favor your strong suit: numbers, not words. It’s always better to show your expertise by <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/why-you-should-include-numbers-on-your-technical-resume">sharing the numbers</a>. Numbers are objective, they are facts, and they help readers understand precisely what you did. For each role on your resume, we’ll ask for numbers that detail your success.</p><p>Examples of good numbers to share:</p><ul><li>Load time reduced by xx ms</li><li>Site engagement increased by xx%</li><li>Bug fix time reduced by xx days</li><li>Data usage reduced by xx %</li><li>Revenue increased by xx %</li><li>etc.</li></ul><p>Anything where you can <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/why-you-should-include-numbers-on-your-technical-resume">quantify</a> the specific improvements that happened because you were the engineer on the job.</p><h3>Technologies</h3><p>We list the technologies you’ve used at the end. For more experienced engineers, your particular technology stack may matter less than your overall track record. While for more junior engineers, the placement on the first (and only) page means this important data is at the fingertips of hiring managers and recruiters.</p><p>I hope this overview has been helpful. MeetLeet helps technologists get ahead in their careers by <a href="https://signup.meetleet.com/">writing great technical resumes for free</a>. We’d love for you to sign up.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p><em>In the age of productivity and endless distractions, your ability to stay focused on a task for prolonged periods of time is essential for both your economic state and self-worth. The more you’re able to repeal against the distractions that are trying to robe you from your focus, the more you’ll make progress on important tasks. This will lead to higher incomes and give you a sense of completion. But battling disturbing noises</em> <em>is almost impossible not because of our phones, it’s because our mind has the tendency to self-generate thoughts that are unrelated to the current task.</em></p>



<p>Our conscious experience is unstable. We can rarely stay focused on a single topic for extended periods of time. And although modern distractions are contributing to our inability to concentrate, the most significant aspect of our vulnerable concentration is explained by the concept of mind-wandering.</p>



<p>You can’t <a href="https://durmonski.com/productivity/how-to-read-more-books/" target="_blank" aria-label="read a book (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">read a book</a> not because you don’t understand the words inside, but because your mind is constantly producing a web of thoughts that are totally different from the current task.</p>



<p>Failure to realize when your mind-wanders and your inability to capture a fleeting conscious, train it, and re-focus it, is costly. You’ll always be late with tasks and your overall concentration will suffer.</p>



<p>In this article, we’ll explore what is mind-wandering, how can you use it to your advantage and how can you reduce the drifting attention so you can boost your productivity.</p>







<h2>What is Mind-Wandering?</h2>



<p>What happens in our mind is often not related to what we’re experiencing, here and now. Mind-wandering is the ability of the brain to generate thoughts that are unrelated, or somehow related to what we’re actually doing <em>right now</em>.</p>



<p>As stated in a recent study, “when the mind wanders, attention drifts from its current train of thought (often an external task) to mental content generated by the individual rather than cued by the environment.”<span id="easy-footnote-1-12049"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-12049" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-010814-015331&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; aria-label=&quot;The Science of Mind Wandering: Empirically Navigating the Stream of Consciousness (opens in a new tab)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>The Science of Mind Wandering: Empirically Navigating the Stream of Consciousness</a>; Vol. 66:487-518 (Volume publication date January 2015)."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>



<p>These self-generated thoughts can be categorized as task related as well as task unrelated.</p>

<p>And if you think that you don’t ever fall under the time-wasting <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/rich-dads-cashflow-quadrant/" target="_blank" aria-label="quadrants (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">quadrants</a>, studies on the subject indicate that we spend up to 50% of our waking hours thinking about things that are not related to our current activity.<span id="easy-footnote-2-12049"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-12049" title="<a aria-label=&quot;How pervasive is mind wandering, really? (opens in a new tab)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323431598_How_pervasive_is_mind_wandering_really&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>How pervasive is mind wandering, really?</a>; Kane et al. 2007, Killingsworth &amp;amp; Gilbert 2010"><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>



<p>This means that our ability to self-generate thoughts is not only an inseparable part of our daily lives, it’s basically how half of our lives are lived. And since what we think is basically what we actually experience, understanding how, why, and when the mind-wanders is going to help you understand more deeply yourself.</p>







<h2>Why The Mind-Wanders and Why It’s Important to Understand?</h2>



<p>First, let’s take a look at why the mind-wanders:</p>



<p>The most common reason our minds are racing and looking for different things to engage in is how we perceive the current task. If the outcome of what we’re doing right now, is considered with low value, we’ll automatically seek to find another goal that is with higher value – or at least something that can give us a faster outcome.<span id="easy-footnote-3-12049"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-12049" title="Neuroscience of Consciousness, <a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2019/1/niz014/5602511#165098552&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; aria-label=&quot;Volume 2019 (opens in a new tab)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>Volume 2019</a>, Issue 1, 2019."><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>



<p>For example, the outcome of <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/how-to-read-a-book/" target="_blank" aria-label="reading a lengthy book (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">reading a lengthy book</a> comes after you’ve finished the book – or at least that how most people think. So, naturally, if you’re just starting, the perceived end result, and gain, will probably take a week, or more – depending on how fast you read. Once you realize that the present goal is not going to produce <a href="https://durmonski.com/self-improvement/lack-of-feedback/" target="_blank" aria-label="immediate results (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">immediate results</a>, we conclude (unconsciously) that it’s much wiser to stop reading and start doing something with a faster outcome – <a href="https://durmonski.com/life-advice/why-i-quit-social-media/" target="_blank" aria-label="check social media (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">check social media</a> for example.</p>



<p>All of this happens without our conscious consent. Simply the mind does some calculations in the background and forces us to direct our thoughts towards tasks that give us immediate results.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, there are two other things that are common escape routes for the mind: past-related thoughts and future thinking. These two are the common paths our mind takes to disengage from the current task.</p>



<p>Let’s review them in short:</p>



<p>Unhappiness and past problems, or current, which are again based on past experiences, stray our minds towards past events. For example, if you’re worried about your job because you failed to deliver a report on time, your mind will jump back in time and play events that are related to this line of thought.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the future-thinking model is more related to happy feelings. If we’re working on a <a href="https://durmonski.com/self-improvement/the-three-year-rule/" target="_blank" aria-label="long-term goal (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-term goal</a>, you’ll often think about the possible happy outcomes. If you’re <a href="https://durmonski.com/business/1000-true-fans-theory/" target="_blank" aria-label="starting a business (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">starting a business</a> or if you have a scheduled vacation, you’ll interrupt your tasks with thoughts about the joyful moments that are yet to come.</p>



<p>With the above being said, the importance of acknowledging mind-wandering is pretty obvious. If we don’t control our thoughts we’ll constantly find ourselves thinking about tasks that are not in line with that we’re doing. And since we’ll think about happy or not so things, we will never successfully do the work that is required of us at the moment.</p>







<h2>How is Mind-Wandering Influencing Our Lives?</h2>



<p>Apart from forcing us to think about I-can’t-believe-I-did-this type of events that can lead to depression, the other most common downside of this unfocused way of thinking is <a href="https://durmonski.com/productivity/how-to-become-more-productive-and-less-lazy/" target="_blank" aria-label="reduced productivity (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">reduced productivity</a>.</p>



<p>When you’re unable to control your line of thought, you’ll constantly start over and spend hours doing the simplest activities.</p>



<p>But spending an hour to write a simple “Thank You” email is nothing compared to the following consequence…</p>



<p>In our daily lives, the most dangerous result of our tendency to constantly self-generate thoughts is when we drive. If we’re not 100% focused on the road and on what is happening around us, we can make wrong decisions – or even worse, not make a decision at all when we have to – which can lead to bad consequences. And while thinking about what you want to eat while you steer the wheel might not be so bad, we have a tendency to completely detach ourselves from the current realm and go to another, imaginary place.</p>



<p>This important aspect of mind-wandering is called perceptual decoupling. In this state, we completely disengaging from what is happening here and now. We focus on internal desires and pay little, or no attention to what’s happening around us. Zoning out is a way to understand this distracted state of the mind.</p>

<p>And if during mind-wandering you’re just thinking about doing something else, when in perceptual decoupling you’re basically imagining a whole new world.</p>



<p>The consequences as mentioned can be quite devastating. From not doing your job on time to not paying attention to the road when you’re driving.</p>







<h2><strong>How Can You Reduce Mind-Wandering?</strong></h2>



<p>You can’t completely shut off-task thoughts. What you can do though, to <a href="https://durmonski.com/productivity/the-one-thing-principle/">increase your productivity</a> and to make sure you’re concentrated while performing important tasks such as driving, is to direct (on time) your focus on the activities that are happening here and now.</p>



<p>Here are some things you can practice to reduce wandering of the mind and improve your focus:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Increase difficulty</strong>: Tasks that are nearly automated and require little mental effort from your side are mind-wandering incubators. If the current task can’t challenge your thinking you’ll immediately start thinking about other things. The easiest way to concentrate and decrease the number of off-topic thoughts that circle in your mind is to increase the difficultly of the task. To engage in works that are more demanding.</li><li><strong>Social pressure</strong>: Another way to manipulate your concentration, in a good way, is to put yourself in front of others. When we’re exposed, we have the ability to concentrate. For example, public speaking is a form of social stress that will force you to focus. If you have to make a presentation, or if you publicly declare that you’ll do something, the social stress and the fear of being publicly ashamed will arm you with the power to focus and do your job. In addition to this, you can consider “getting” an accountability partner. Get someone watch over your shoulder and “check-in” with you regularly to see how you’re progressing.</li><li><strong>Journaling</strong>: Current or past problems, if not 100% solved, are constantly present in the back of our mind, stealing our attention and hurting our mood negatively. When there are important tasks or problems that are pending, the best way to get them off your head is by writing them down. The act of writing what needs to be done will liberate you from the constant thoughts associated with this problem or situation.</li><li><strong>Meta-awareness</strong>: The role meta-awareness plays when your mind is drifting is huge. The faster you “catch” yourself drifting, the faster you’ll bring your mind back to the task at hand. Letting your mind wanders for long periods of time will greatly reduce your performance. And if you let your mind carelessly explore off-topics when you actually need to work you’ll turn this into a nasty habit. When you realize that you’re zoning out, you can write down what you’re thinking about on a piece of paper and move on with your task.

Which language should you choose for your next project, and why? How do the two compare in areas like performance, simplicity, safety, features, scale, and concurrency? What do they have in common, and where do they fundamentally differ? Let's find out, in this friendly and even-handed comparison of Rust and Golang, from the author of the <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/books/">For the Love of Go</a> book series.</p>
<h2 id="rust-and-go-are-both-awesome">Rust and Go are both awesome</h2>
<p>First, it's really important to say that <em>both Go and Rust are absolutely excellent programming languages</em>. They're modern, powerful, widely-adopted, and offer excellent performance. You may have read articles and blog posts aiming to convince you that Go is better than Rust, or vice versa. But that really makes no sense; every programming language represents a set of trade-offs. Each language is optimised for different things, so your choice of language should be determined by what suits you and the problems you want to solve with it.</p>
<p>In this article, I'll try to give a brief overview of where I think Go is the ideal choice, and where I think Rust is a better alternative. Ideally, though, you should have a working familiarity with both languages. While they're very different in syntax and style, both Rust and Go are first-class tools for building software. With that said, let's take a closer look at the two languages.</p>
<h2 id="the-similarities">The similarities</h2>
<p>Rust and Go have a lot in common, which is one reason you often hear them mentioned together. What are some of the common goals of both languages?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust is a low-level statically-typed multi-paradigm programming language that’s focused on safety and performance.<br>
—<a href="https://serokell.io/blog/rust-guide">Gints Dreimanis</a></p>
<p>Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.<br>
—<a href="https://golang.org/">Golang.org</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="memory-safety">Memory safety</h3>
<p>Both Go and Rust belong to the group of modern programming languages whose priority is <em>memory safety</em>. It's become clear over many decades of using older languages such as C and C++ that one of the biggest causes of bugs and security vulnerabilities is accessing memory unsafely or incorrectly. Rust and Go deal with this problem in different ways, but both aim to be smarter and safer than other languages about managing memory, and to help you write correct and performant programs. </p>
<h3 id="fast-compact-executables">Fast, compact executables</h3>
<p>They're both compiled languages, which means your programs are translated directly to executable machine code, so that you can deploy your program as a single binary file; unlike interpreted languages such as <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/golang/go-vs-python">Python</a> and Ruby, you don't need to distribute an interpreter and lots of libraries and dependencies along with your program, which is a big plus. This also makes both Rust and Go programs extremely fast in comparison to interpreted languages.</p>
<h3 id="general-purpose-languages">General-purpose languages</h3>
<p>Rust and Go are also both powerful, scalable general-purpose programming languages, which you can use to develop all kinds of modern software, from web applications to distributed microservices, or from embedded microcontrollers to mobile apps. Both have excellent standard libraries and a thriving third-party ecosystem, as well as great commercial support and a large user base. They've both been around for many years, and will continue to be widely used for years to come. Learning either Go or Rust today will be a sound investment of your time and effort.</p>
<h3 id="pragmatic-programming-style">Pragmatic programming style</h3>
<p>Neither are primarily functional languages (like Scala or Elixir, for example), and neither are exclusively object-oriented (like Java and C#). Instead, while both Go and Rust have features associated with functional and object-oriented programming, they're pragmatic languages aimed at solving problems in whatever way is most appropriate, rather than forcing you into a particular way of doing things. (If you like the functional style of programming, though, you’ll find a lot more facilities for it in Rust, because Rust <em>has</em> a lot more facilities than Go in general.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can debate about what an ‘object-oriented’ language is, but it’s fair to say that the <em>style</em> of object-oriented programming that C++, Java, or C# users would expect is not present in either Go or Rust.<br>
—Jack Mott</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="development-at-scale">Development at scale</h3>
<p>Both Rust and Go have some useful features which make them suitable for programming in the large, whether that means large teams, or large codebases, or both.</p>
<p>For example, whereas C programmers have argued for years about where to put their brackets, and whether code should be indented with tabs or spaces, both Rust and Go eliminate such issues completely by using a standard formatting tool (<code>gofmt</code> for Go, <code>rustfmt</code> for Rust) which rewrites your code automatically using the canonical style. It’s not that this particular style is so wonderful in itself: it’s the <em>standardisation</em> which Rust and Go programmers appreciate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>gofmt</code>’s style is no one’s favourite, yet <code>gofmt</code> is everyone’s favourite.<br>
—<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAAkCSZUG1c&amp;t=8m43s">Rob Pike</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another area where both languages score highly is in the build pipeline. Both have excellent, built-in, high-performance standard build and dependency management tools; no more wrestling with complex third-party build systems and having to learn a new one every couple of years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Building Go and Rust code, having come from a Java and Ruby background in my early career, felt like an impossible weight off my shoulders. When I was at Google, it was a relief to come across a service that was written in Go, because I knew it would be easy to build and run. This has also been true of Rust, though I've only worked on that at much smaller scale. I'm hoping that the days of infinitely configurable build systems are dead, and languages all ship with their own purpose-built build tools that just work out of the box.<br>
—<a href="https://samwho.dev/">Sam Rose</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="so-what-s-all-the-fuss-about-">So what’s all the fuss about?</h2>
<p>With all that in mind, and seeing that both languages are so well-designed and powerful, you might be wondering what all the holy wars are about (me too). Why do people make such a fuss about 'Go versus Rust', getting into angry social media spats and writing long blog posts about how only an idiot would use Rust, or that Go isn't a real programming language, or whatever. It might make them feel better, but it doesn't exactly help you, as someone trying to decide which language to use for your project, or which you should learn to advance your programming career. A wise person doesn't make important choices based on who shouts the loudest.</p>
<p>Let's continue our grown-up discussion now by looking at some areas where a reasonable person might prefer one language over the other.</p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>We've said that both Go and Rust produce extremely fast programs because they're compiled to native machine code, without having to go through an interpreter or virtual machine. However, Rust's performance is particularly outstanding. It's comparable with C and C++, which are often regarded as the highest-performance compiled languages, but unlike these older languages, it also offers memory safety and concurrency safety at essentially no cost in execution speed. Rust also allows you to create complex abstractions without paying a performance penalty at run-time.</p>
<p>By comparison, although Go programs also perform extremely well, Go is primarily designed for speed of <em>development</em> (including compilation), rather than speed of execution. The Go compiler doesn’t spend a lot of time trying to generate the most efficient possible machine code; it cares more about compiling lots of code quickly. So Rust will usually beat Go in run-time benchmarks.</p>
<p>Rust’s run-time performance is also consistent and predictable, because it doesn’t use garbage collection. Go’s garbage collector is very efficient, and it’s optimised to make its stop-the-world pauses as short as possible (and getting shorter with every new Go release). But garbage collection inevitably introduces some unpredictability in the way programs behave, which can be a serious issue in some applications, such as embedded systems.</p>
<p>Because Rust aims to give the programmer complete control of the underlying hardware, it's possible to optimise Rust programs to be pretty close to the maximum theoretical performance of the machine. This makes Rust an excellent choice for areas where speed of execution beats all other considerations, such as game programming, operating system kernels, web browser components, and real-time control systems.</p>
<h2 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h2>
<p>It doesn't matter how fast a programming language is if nobody can figure out how to use it. Go was deliberately conceived as a reaction against the ever-growing complexity of languages like C++; it has very little syntax, very few keywords, and, indeed, few features. This means it doesn't take long to learn the Go language to the point where you can write useful programs in it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go is incredibly easy to learn. I know this is an often-touted benefit, but I was really surprised at how quickly I was able to be productive. Thanks to the language, docs, and tools, I was writing interesting, committable code after literally two days.<br>
—<a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/early-impressions-of-go-from-a-rust-programmer-f4fd1074c410">Early Impressions of Go From a Rust Programmer</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key word here is <em>simplicity</em>. Simple isn't the same as easy, for sure, but a small, simple language is easier to learn than a large, complex one. There just aren't that many different ways to do things, so all well-written Go code tends to look the same. It’s easy to just dive into an unfamiliar service and understand what it’s doing.</p>
<pre><code>fmt.Println("Gopher's Diner Breakfast Menu")
for dish, price := range menu {
    fmt.Println(dish, price)
}</code></pre>
<p>Although the core language is small, Go’s standard library is very powerful. That means your learning curve will also need to include the parts of the standard library that you need, not just Go syntax. On the other hand, moving functionality out of the language and into the standard library means that you can focus on learning only the libraries that are relevant to you right now.</p>
<p>Go is also designed for software development at scale, with large codebases and large teams. In these situations, …</p></div></div></div>

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>I heard before that Erlang and the BEAM did not pack a static type system
because their creators <em>“couldn’t build it”</em>.</p>
<p>That is nonsense.</p>
<p>While building a sophisticated, reliable and scalable type checker is
absolutely not a walk in the park, building one that works is not that hard.</p>
<p>If it could have been done, it would’ve been done, and it would’ve been
hardened by the same process OTP was hardened and turned into what it is today:
a reliability gold standard.</p>
<p>So I decided to write an Erlang type-checker to really understand what is hard
about typing Erlang. I know Dialyzer exists, and its great, I just wanted to
get a good understanding from scratch.</p>
<p>It hit me that there is a split in here, that is sometimes hard to notice and
it makes a world of a difference. There is <strong>an Erlang language</strong>, called
Standard Erlang, and there is <strong>an Erlang Runtime</strong>, the BEAM. Along the same
lines as there is a Java language, and then there’s the JVM.</p>
<p>We tend to speak of these 2 things as if they were one, but if we isolate the
language from the runtime, we find that they exhibit very different behaviors.</p>
<p>In particular the runtime brings to the table <em>distribution</em> and  <em>hot code
reloading</em>, which makes typing things a distributed-systems problem. Fun, yes,
but very impractical.</p>
<p>On following essays I’ll do a more thorough and formal treatise of the
operational semantics of the language and how to go about implementing your own
type-checker for it, the distributed and dynamic nature of the runtime, and how
they interact with each other.</p>
<p>Here I’ll go over what I’ve learned takes to type the Standard Erlang in a more
superficial way, and what are some thorny parts that we will encounter.</p>
<p>First, lets scope what actually <em>is</em> Standard Erlang.</p>
<h2>Standard Erlang</h2>
<p>Erlang is a dynamically, strongly typed language. It includes just a little
extra over your typical functional programming language. Overall, Erlang isn’t
<a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/master/lib/stdlib/src/erl_parse.yrl">that big a
language</a>.</p>
<p>My eye-ball estimation is that it is about a 3rd of the size of OCaml, and
about a 5th of the size of Java.</p>
<p>Here’s some Erlang:</p>
<pre><code>% an erlang module
-module(hello_world).

-export([hi/1]).  % &lt;-- this a compiler annotation

hi(noone) -&gt; sad;
hi(Name) -&gt; &lt;&lt;"Hello, ", (Name)/binary, "!"&gt;&gt;.
</code></pre>
<p>An Erlang program consists of a number of <code>modules</code>, each module is just a file
with a bunch of <code>functions</code> in it and a few <code>annotations</code> used to tell the
compiler what’s exported, who the module author is, what a function type is
supposed to be, etc.</p>
<p>There’s quite a few things you can write in Erlang that are relatively common:</p>
<ul>
<li>literals like booleans, numbers or strings</li>
<li>lists, maps, tuples, lambdas</li>
<li>ifs, try/catch, case</li>
<li>function calls and references</li>
</ul>
<p>And then there’s a few things that aren’t common at all:</p>
<ul>
<li>atoms, which are just constants</li>
<li>receive expressions</li>
<li>all sorts of pattern matching</li>
<li>everything is done through recursion</li>
</ul>
<p>But in general, the language expressivity comes from it being rather simple.
Most problems are solved by making functions that call each other, most
functions pattern match on exactly the data they need, loops are achieved
through recursion, and we’re done.</p>
<p>Exceptions are very common, since failing to pattern match will result in an
exception. For this the language supports the <code>catch</code>, and <code>try..catch..after</code>
expressions, but it is highly unidiomatic to use them.</p>
<p>The superb uptime through supervision that Erlang is known for is actually
baked into the runtime, not the language. The language itself has no notion of
processes, links, or sending messages. The only thing it does have is <em>receive</em>
expressions for <em>consuming messages</em>.</p>
<p>Armed with this understanding, lets dig into how we could type Erlang.</p>
<h2>Typing the Erlang Language</h2>
<p>In writing the type-checker, I’ve found a few things that are worth bringing up:</p>
<ol>
<li>Functions on Untagged Unions</li>
<li>Functions on Records</li>
<li>Functions on Tagged Unions (Variants)</li>
<li>Receive Expressions</li>
<li>Dynamic Dispatch and <code>M:F(A)</code> syntax</li>
</ol>
<p>There may be other language constructs that are not friendly to static
analysis. I’ll try to write and cover more in the future.</p>
<h3>1. Functions on Untagged Unions</h3>
<p>An Erlang value can have a single type but we expect that type to be known only
at runtime. This means that both the input and returning types of a function
are actually unknown <em>until</em> we run the function.</p>
<p>So whenever you see a function like <code>hi/1</code> above, calling it could actually
return a value of different types, depending on how the function was written.</p>
<p>For example, calling <code>hi(noone)</code> returns the atom <code>sad</code>. Instead, calling
<code>hi(&lt;&lt;"Joe"&gt;&gt;)</code> returns the string <code>&lt;&lt;"Hello, Joe!"&gt;&gt;</code>. The atom <code>sad</code> and the
string have different types. Calling <code>hi(0)</code> will result in an exception.</p>
<p>If we were to write down the type of this function we’d have to say something
like:</p>
<pre><code>hi(atom("noone") | string) -&gt; atom("sad") | string
</code></pre>
<p>This is present in every other dynamic language: Lisp, Lua, Javascript, Python,
Ruby, Smalltalk, you name it.</p>
<p>Writing a type-checker that deals with this is certainly possible, as it has
been done before in tools like <a href="https://abstractmachines.dev/posts/flow-type">Flow</a> and <a href="https://abstractmachines.dev/posts/typescript">TypeScript</a>,
but it certainly isn’t obvious how to.</p>
<p>To better understand how this can be dealt with, we need to talk about <a href="https://abstractmachines.dev/posts/union-types">Union
Types</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Union types</strong> allow us to express that a value may belong to one of many
different types at the same time. E.g, <code>1</code> is a <code>number</code>, but it is also a
<code>(number | bool)</code>. In the same way, <code>true</code> is a <code>bool</code>, but it is also a
<code>(number | bool)</code>.</p>
<p>We read <code>(number | bool)</code> as “number or bool”.</p>
<p>The key here is that the value itself doesn’t have explicit information about
which type from the union it actually belongs to, and we’re bound to find this
out through <em>refinements</em>.</p>
<p>We can do these refinements in 2 ways through the use of guards and pattern
matching.</p>

<p><strong>Through the use of guards</strong> we can refine the actual type of a value into a
single type. For example:</p>
<pre><code>% the infamous left_pad function
left_pad(A, B) when is_binary(A) -&gt; &lt;&lt;(A)/binary, (B)/binary&gt;&gt;;
left_pad(A, B) when is_number(A) -&gt; left_pad(binary:copy(&lt;&lt;" "&gt;&gt;, A), B).
</code></pre>
<p>This function is has the following signature:</p>
<pre><code>left_pad( string | number, string ) -&gt; string
</code></pre>
<p>But it is thanks to the guards <code>is_binary/1</code> and <code>is_number/1</code> that we <em>refine</em>
the type of the inputs to be just <code>string</code> or just <code>number</code>.</p>
<p>This makes it possible to say that <code>binary:copy(&lt;&lt;" "&gt;&gt;, A)</code> is safe, because
at that point we know that <code>is_number(A)</code> was true, and so <code>A</code>’s type has been
refined from <code>string | number</code> to just <code>number</code>. Otherwise the guard would have
been false.</p>
<p>However, we can’t use any function as a guard. We must use only built-in
functions that already come with the Erlang runtime.</p>
<p>This makes it impossible to write arbitrary refinement logic, which makes the
approach rather limited.</p>

<p><strong>Through pattern matching</strong> we can do something very similar, and establish
our expectations of the values. For example:</p>
<pre><code>% a good old list length counter
count(A=[_|_]) -&gt; count(A, 0).

count([], C) -&gt; C;
count([_|T], C) -&gt; count(T, C+1).
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, we are guaranteed that if our function pattern matches, then <code>A</code>
will be a list.</p>
<p>We don’t really know what the list elements are, but of course we can try and
continue pattern matching and using guards until we refine it “enough”.</p>
<p>These two approaches, while composable, have the unfortunate property that they
don’t generalize to all kinds of data. They should work well tho for: atoms,
literals, and anything that there is a guard available for.</p>
<p>Anything where our data is one of type <em>or</em> another, would fall into this
category.</p>
<p>Maps, tuples, and records can work with this, but it doesn’t scale very well.
You essentially have to add the new map/tuple/record name to the union every
time you want it supported. Even if you need a single field out of them.</p>
<p>In the next section we’ll see a different approach for dealing with this data
that scales much better.</p>
<h3>2. Functions on Record Types</h3>
<p>When working with functions that take as inputs many values packed into one, be
it with records, maps, or tuples, we’re faced with a different issue: we don’t
care what the input type is <em>as long as it has what we need in it</em>.</p>
<p>For example, if we have two possible maps that share some things, both of them
could be thought of as their own separate type, and these 2 types would have
something in common.</p>
<pre><code>% this has type 'character'
Character = #{ name =&gt; "Alexander Hamilton", play =&gt; "Hamilton" }.

% this has type 'performer'
Performer = #{ name =&gt; "Lin-Manuel Miranda" }.
</code></pre>
<p>Now if we make a function to get the name of a Performer:</p>
<pre><code>name(#{ name := Name }) -&gt; Name.
</code></pre>
<p>and we give it a type:</p>
<pre><code>name(performer) -&gt; string.
</code></pre>
<p>Would we expect this function to work on Characters?</p>
<p>My answer is yes, since Characters also have a <code>name</code> fields.</p>
<p>In fact, I’d say that it will work just fine for any map <em>as long as it has a
name key that is a string</em>.</p>
<p>So the type of our function isn’t quite <code>(character | performer)</code>. It actually
is “Any map as long as it has a name key that is a string”. I’ll use this
notation for that: <code>#{ name }</code></p>
<pre><code>name(#{ name : A }) -&gt; A
</code></pre>
<p>Some type-systems support this with Structural Subtyping, some others use Row
Polymorphism. The main difference isn’t obvious in this getter function, but
becomes obvious in the next one, a setter:</p>
<pre><code>with_name(Name, M=#{ name := _ }) -&gt; M#{ name =&gt; Name }.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>The structural subtyping approach</strong> would say that whatever you put in, it is
now known to only have a <code>name</code> key. So all your other keys have disappeared
(to the eyes of the type-system) and if you want to recover them you have to do
some sort of casting. This is due to a subtyping behavior called <em>subsumption</em>
and its the way that TypeScript handles this.</p>
<p><strong>The row polymorphic approach</strong> has no information loss, and instead carries
around the rest of the fields that <code>M</code> had. This is how OCaml and PureScript
handles this. In PureScript this works for record types and in OCaml this is</p></section></section></div>

<ol>
<li>I finished developing a CSS game (<a target="_blank" href="https://flexboxadventure.com/">Flex Box Adventure</a>) using Gatsby.</li>
<li>Deployed it to Netlify.</li>
<li>Shared it with folks on Twitter and said, “Share your feedback with me.”</li>
<li>Went to sleep.</li>
<li>Waked up.</li>
<li>Opened Twitter DMs.</li>

</li>
<li><p>Surprised because how two small static HTML web pages can slow down the website's loading speed.</p>
</li>
<li>Decided to check it out.</li>
<li>Opened Google Chrome.</li>
<li>Typed the website url in the search bar.</li>
<li>Pressed “Enter.”</li>
<li>Waited for the website to load.</li>
<li>Opened Google Chrome dev tools.</li>
<li>Clicked on the “Network” tab.</li>
<li><p>Found that my web page weighs 156KB:

<li>Asked myself, “How did I place eighty-eight thousand lines of CSS in my code?”</li>
<li>Remembered that the only styles I imported into the App.tsx file (besides my 300 lines index.css) were Tailwind CSS.</li>
<li>Googled, “Tailwind CSS in production.”</li>
<li>Clicked on the first link.</li>
<li><p>Found out that I forgot about purging CSS.

<p>What have I learned from this situation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Users are the best testers.</li>
<li>Never go to sleep after sharing your first version of the product.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="one-lesson-for-you">One Lesson For You</h2>
<p>In fact, nothing critical happened. Only one person pointed to the website loading speed, out of 40+ others who gave me feedback about the game.</p>
<p>What does it say to us?</p>
<p>You can spend time building your product until it becomes perfect, then test it for months and, without fear, release it to the public.</p>
<p>Or you can stop wasting your precious time on seeking perfection and unnecessary pre-optimization and release your product as soon as you have built an MVP (minimum viable product)</p>
<p>Just remember one thing, <strong>40 users in one day can improve your product more (giving ideas and feedback) than you, building it alone in a few months.</strong></p>

See also this series of articles titled <a href="https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/series/unix-as-ide/">Unix as IDE</a>.</p><p>A shell utility like <code>bash</code> provides built-in commands and scripting features to easily solve and automate various tasks. External *nix commands like <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code>, <code>awk</code>, <code>sort</code>, <code>find</code>, <code>parallel</code>, etc can be combined to work with each other. Depending upon your familiarity with those tools, you can either use <code>perl</code> as a single replacement or complement them for specific use cases.</p><p>Here's some one-liners (options will be explained later):</p><ul><li><code>perl -pe 's/(?:\x27;\x27|";")(*SKIP)(*F)|;/#/g'</code> — change <code>;</code> to <code>#</code> but don't change <code>;</code> within single or double quotes</li><li><code>perl -MList::Util=uniq -e 'print uniq &lt;&gt;'</code> — retain only first copy of duplicated lines, uses built-in module <code>List::Util</code></li><li><code>perl -MRegexp::Common=net -nE 'say join "\n", //g if /$RE{net}{IPv4}/'</code> — extract only IPv4 addresses, using a third-party <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Regexp::Common">Regexp::Common</a> module</li><li>Some stackoverflow Q&amp;A that I've answered over the years with simpler <code>perl</code> solution compared to other cli tools <ul><li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42554684/shell-replace-string-with-incrementing-value">replace string with incrementing value</a></li><li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48920626/sort-rows-in-csv-file-without-header-first-column">sort rows in csv file without header &amp; first column</a></li><li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63681983/sed-reverse-matched-pattern">reverse matched pattern</a></li><li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49765879/append-zeros-to-list">append zeros to list</a></li><li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62241101/arithmetic-replacement-in-a-text-file">arithmetic replacement in a text file</a></li><li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45571828/execute-bash-command-inside-awk-and-print-command-output">reverse complement DNA sequence for a specific field</a></li></ul></li></ul><p>The selling point of <code>perl</code> over tools like <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> includes feature rich regular expression engine and standard/third-party modules. If you don't already know the syntax and idioms for <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code>, learning command line options for <code>perl</code> would be the easier option. Another advantage is that <code>perl</code> is more portable compared to GNU, BSD and Mac implementations of cli tools. The main disadvantage is that <code>perl</code> is likely to be slower for features that are supported out of the box by those tools.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_perl_oneliners/images/info.svg" alt="info"> See also <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/303044/when-to-use-grep-less-awk-sed">unix.stackexchange: when to use grep, sed, awk, perl, etc</a></p></blockquote><h2><a href="#installation-and-documentation" id="installation-and-documentation">Installation and Documentation</a></h2><p>If you are on a Unix like system, you are most likely to already have some version of Perl installed. See <a href="https://www.cpan.org/src/README.html">cpan: Perl Source</a> for instructions to install the latest <code>perl</code> version from source. <code>perl v5.32.0</code> is used for all the examples shown in this book.</p><p>You can use <code>perldoc</code> command to access documentation from the command line.

Some more options will be covered in later chapters, but not all of them are discussed in this book.</p><h2><a href="#executing-perl-code" id="executing-perl-code">Executing Perl code</a></h2><p>If you want to execute a <code>perl</code> program file, one way is to pass the filename as argument to the <code>perl</code> command.</p><pre><code>$ echo 'print "Hello Perl\n"' &gt; hello.pl
$ perl hello.pl
Hello Perl
</code></pre><p>For short programs, you can also directly pass the code as an argument to the <code>-e</code> or <code>-E</code> options. See <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/feature">perldoc: feature</a> for details about the features enabled by the <code>-E</code> option.</p><pre><code>$ perl -e 'print "Hello Perl\n"'
Hello Perl

$ # multiple statements can be issued separated by ;
$ # -l option will be covered in detail later, appends \n to 'print' here
$ perl -le '$x=25; $y=12; print $x**$y'
59604644775390625
$ # or, use -E and 'say' instead of -l and 'print'
$ perl -E '$x=25; $y=12; say $x**$y'
59604644775390625
</code></pre><h2><a href="#filtering" id="filtering">Filtering</a></h2><p><code>perl</code> one-liners can be used for filtering lines matched by a regexp, similar to <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code>. And similar to many command line utilities, <code>perl</code> can accept input from both <code>stdin</code> and file arguments.</p><pre><code>$ # sample stdin data
$ printf 'gate\napple\nwhat\nkite\n'
gate
apple
what
kite

$ # print all lines containing 'at'
$ # same as: grep 'at' and sed -n '/at/p' and awk '/at/'
$ printf 'gate\napple\nwhat\nkite\n' | perl -ne 'print if /at/'
gate
what

$ # print all lines NOT containing 'e'
$ # same as: grep -v 'e' and sed -n '/e/!p' and awk '!/e/'
$ printf 'gate\napple\nwhat\nkite\n' | perl -ne 'print if !/e/'
what
</code></pre><p>By default, <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> will automatically loop over input content line by line (with <code>\n</code> as the line distinguishing character). The <code>-n</code> or <code>-p</code> option will enable this feature for <code>perl</code>. <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_perl_oneliners/using-modules.html#convert-one-liners-to-pretty-formatted-scripts">O module</a> section shows the code Perl runs with these options.</p><p>As seen before, the <code>-e</code> option accepts code as command line argument. Many shortcuts are available to reduce the amount of typing needed. In the above examples, a regular expression (defined by the pattern between a pair of forward slashes) has been used to filter the input. When the input string isn't specified, the test is performed against special variable <code>$_</code>, which has the contents of the current input line here (the correct term would be input <strong>record</strong>, see <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_perl_oneliners/record-separators.html#record-separators">Record separators</a> chapter). <code>$_</code> is also the default argument for many functions like <code>print</code> and <code>say</code>. To summarize:</p><ul><li><code>/REGEXP/FLAGS</code> is a shortcut for <code>$_ =~ m/REGEXP/FLAGS</code></li><li><code>!/REGEXP/FLAGS</code> is a shortcut for <code>$_ !~ m/REGEXP/FLAGS</code></li></ul><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_perl_oneliners/images/info.svg" alt="info"> See <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlop#m/PATTERN/msixpodualngc">perldoc: match</a> for help on <code>m</code> operator. See <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlvar#SPECIAL-VARIABLES">perldoc: special variables</a> for documentation on <code>$_</code>, <code>$&amp;</code>, etc.</p></blockquote><p>Here's an example with file input instead of <code>stdin</code>.</p><pre><code>$ cat table.txt
brown bread mat hair 42
blue cake mug shirt -7
yellow banana window shoes 3.14

$ perl -nE 'say $&amp; if /(?&lt;!-)\d+$/' table.txt

By default, this operates on <code>$_</code> when the input string isn't provided. For these examples, <code>-p</code> option is used instead of <code>-n</code> option, so that the value of <code>$_</code> is automatically printed after processing each input line. See <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlop#s/PATTERN/REPLACEMENT/msixpodualngcer">perldoc: search and replace</a> for documentation and examples.</p><pre><code>$ # for each input line, change only first ':' to '-'

</code></pre><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_perl_oneliners/images/info.svg" alt="info"> The <code>s</code> operator modifies the input string it is acting upon if the pattern matches. In addition, it will return number of substitutions made if successful, otherwise returns a <em>false</em> value (empty string or <code>0</code>). You can use <code>r</code> flag to return string after substitution instead of in-place modification. As mentioned before, this book assumes you are already familiar with <code>perl</code> regular expressions. If not, see <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlretut">perldoc: perlretut</a> to get started.</p></blockquote><h2><a href="#field-processing" id="field-processing">Field processing</a></h2><p>Consider the sample input file shown below with fields separated by a single space character.</p><pre><code>$ cat table.txt
brown bread mat hair 42
blue cake mug shirt -7
yellow banana window shoes 3.14
</code></pre><p>Here's some examples that is based on specific field rather than the entire line. The <code>-a</code> option will cause the input line to be split based on whitespaces and the field contents can be accessed using <code>@F</code> special array variable. Leading and trailing whitespaces will be suppressed, so there's no possibility of empty fields. More details is discussed in <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_perl_oneliners/field-separators.html#default-field-separation">Default field separation</a> section.</p><pre><code>$ # print the second field of each input line
$ # same as: awk '{print $2}' table.txt
$ perl -lane 'print $F[1]' table.txt

$ # print lines only if last field is a negative number

  <p><span>06 Nov 2020</span></p>
  <p>Over the last two years, our Julia codebase has grown in size and complexity, and is now the centerpiece of both our operations and research.
This implies that we need to routinely replace parts of the system like puzzle pieces, and carefully test if the results lead to improvements along various dimensions of performance.
However, those pieces are not designed to work in isolation, and thus cannot be tested in a vacuum.
They also tend to be quite large and complex, and therefore often need to be independent packages, which need to “fit” together in precise ways determined by the rest of the system.
This is where interfaces come in handy: they are tools for isolating and precisely testing specific pieces of a large system.</p>

<p>In order to have the option of reusing an interface without pulling in a lot of extra code, we avoid embedding the interface into any package using it, allowing it to exist in a package on its own.
This approach also makes it easier to keep track of the changes to the interface, when these are not tied to unrelated changes in other packages.
This results in a set of very slim interface packages that define what functional pieces need to be filled in and how they should fit.</p>

<h2 id="interface-packages">Interface Packages</h2>

<p>For our purposes, an interface package is any Julia package that contains an abstract type with no concrete implementation—a sort of IOU in code.
Most functions defined for the type are either un-implemented or are based on other, un-implemented functions.
Despite having very little code, the docstrings form a sort of contract laying out what methods a concrete implementation should have and what they should do in order for the implementation to be considered valid.
A package implementing the interface but missing methods or using different function signatures from interface package can be said to break the contract.
As long as the contract between the concrete and abstract interface remains unbroken, a package using the interface should be able to swap out any concrete implementation for any other and still run as expected provided the user package is using the interface as documented.</p>

<p>In order to improve the modularity of the code, they are separated from the code that uses the abstract type.
This results in interface packages essentially looking like design documents.
For example, below we sketch an interface package for a database.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>AbstractDB</span>

<span>"""
    AbstractDB

A simple API for read only access to a database.
"""</span>
<span>abstract type</span><span> AbstractDB</span> <span>end</span>

<span>"""
    AbstractResponse

Query data needed for fetch.
"""</span>
<span>abstract type</span><span> AbstractResponse</span> <span>end</span>

<span>"""
    query(
        db::AbstractDB,
        table::String,
        features::Vector{Feature}
    ) -&gt; AbstractResponse

Submit an appropriate query to `table` in `db` asking for results matching
`features`.
"""</span>
<span>function</span><span> query</span> <span>end</span>


<span>"""
    fetch(
        db::AbstractDB,
        response::Union{Response,Vector{Response}}
    ) -&gt; DataFrame

Retrieve the results from `response` and parses them into a `DataFrame`.
"""</span>
<span>function</span><span> fetch</span> <span>end</span>

<span>"""
    easy_query(
        db::AbstractDB,
        table::String,
        features::Vector{Feature}
    ) -&gt; DataFrame

Submit  and fetches a query to `table` in `db` asking for results matching
`features`.
"""</span>
<span>function</span><span> easy_query</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>::</span><span>AbstractDB</span><span>,</span> <span>table</span><span>::</span><span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>features</span><span>::</span><span>Vector</span><span>{</span><span>Feature</span><span>})</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>,</span> <span>query</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>,</span> <span>table</span><span>,</span> <span>features</span><span>))</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For our purposes, we will assume a <code>Feature</code> type exists and corresponds to a column in a database table with some criteria for selecting rows.
We will also assume that <code>filter</code>ing a <code>DataFrame</code> by some <code>Feature</code>s works, but is too inefficient to be used in practice.</p>

<h3 id="a-problem-with-interface-packages">A problem with interface packages</h3>

<p>While simple to write, interface packages can fall victim to a common failure.
Since interface packages provide little more than function names and docstrings, it’s easy for the packages around them to “go rogue”, changing the function signatures for the interface as they see fit without updating the actual interface package.
This ends up creating a secret, undocumented interface known only to the implemented types and whichever packages manage to use them.</p>

<p>For example, let’s say a concrete subtype of our <code>AbstractDB</code> database example above changes to let a user define a fancy transform to join up results during <code>fetch</code> in a new version.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># RogueDB.jl</span>
<span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>::</span><span>RogueDB</span><span>,</span> <span>response</span><span>::</span><span>Vector</span><span>{</span><span>Response</span><span>},</span> <span>fancy_transform</span><span>::</span><span>Callable</span><span>)</span>
<span>easy_query</span><span>(</span>
    <span>db</span><span>::</span><span>RogueDB</span><span>,</span>
    <span>table</span><span>::</span><span>String</span><span>,</span>
    <span>features</span><span>::</span><span>Vector</span><span>{</span><span>Feature</span><span>},</span>
    <span>fancy_transform</span><span>=</span><span>donothing</span><span>()</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>fancy_transform</code> has a fallback and does not break the contract the interface sets out, but it can cause problems if other packages only refer back to <code>RogueDB</code>.
If another package <code>X</code> claims to use an <code>AbstractDB</code> but makes use of the <code>fancy_transform</code> in both functions and doesn’t fall back to the documented version of <code>fetch</code>, it now can’t switch to another <code>AbstractDB</code>.
This goes unnoticed, as <code>X</code> is only tested against <code>RogueDB</code>.</p>

<p>Say we now want to hook up another DB to <code>X</code> so we make the fetch function when <code>NewDB</code> is created.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># NewDB.jl</span>
<span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>::</span><span>NewDB</span><span>,</span> <span>response</span><span>::</span><span>Vector</span><span>{</span><span>Response</span><span>},</span> <span>fancy_transform</span><span>::</span><span>Callable</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above <code>fetch</code> <em>does</em> break the contract with the interface package, but <code>X</code> has been used for several months and nobody questions the API, so <code>fetch</code> without the <code>fancy_transform</code> is not implemented.
<code>X</code> uses the default <code>easy_query</code> with <code>NewDB</code>, which does not include the <code>fancy_transform</code> argument.
Calling <code>easy_query</code> will cause a <code>MethodError</code>, but <code>X</code> only calls that function in an untested (or mocked) special case and the bug goes unseen.</p>

<p>Further suppose that <code>AbstractDB</code> has been at v0.1 for 2 years and still has the original definition of <code>fetch</code>.
There are several other DB packages being used in other packages that use the documented <code>fetch</code>, but nobody has noticed they are different.
Now the interface package doesn’t serve its purpose, as other packages using the interface as documented will fail to run the rogue implementations.
New implementations will have to guess at the secret interface set up by the rogue packages in order to fit into the existing ecosystem.
The version of the interface being used is dependent upon multiple packages, potentially causing chaos!</p>

<h2 id="test-utils">Test Utils</h2>

<p>Having a robust set of test utilities gives an interface package enough muscle to enforce the contract it sets out.</p>

<p>A good test utility for an interface package contains two key components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A test fake: a simplified implementation of the type for user packages to play with.</li>
  <li>A test suite codifying a minimum set of constraints an implementation must obey to be considered legitimate.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-test-suite">The Test Suite</h3>

<h4 id="how">How?</h4>

<p>The test suite is a function or set of functions that work as a validation test for a concrete implementation of a type.
It should codify the expectations of the abstract type (e.g., function signatures, return types) as precisely as possible.
The tests should check that a new implementation does not break the contract that an abstract type sets out.</p>

<p>The test suite should simply test that the interface for the type works as expected.
It does not replace unit tests for the correctness of output or any special-cased behaviour, nor can it be expected to check any implementation details or corner cases.
The test suites should be run as part of the unit tests for any implementation of the type.
If the API changes, it should give instant feedback when the expectations of the abstract type are not met.</p>

<p>A minimal test suite for the database example might look like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>"""
    test_interface(db::AbstractDB, table::String, features::Vector{Feature})

Check if an `AbstractDB` follows the documented structure.
The arguments supplied to this function should be identical to those for a
successful `query`.
"""</span>
<span>function</span><span> test_interface</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>::</span><span>AbstractDB</span><span>,</span> <span>table</span><span>::</span><span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>features</span><span>::</span><span>Vector</span><span>{</span><span>Feature</span><span>})</span>
    <span>q</span> <span>=</span> <span>query</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>,</span> <span>table</span><span>,</span> <span>features</span><span>)</span>
    <span>@test</span> <span>q</span> <span>isa</span> <span>AbstractResponse</span>

    <span>df</span> <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>,</span> <span>resp</span><span>)</span>
    <span>@test</span> <span>df</span> <span>isa</span> <span>DataFrame</span>

    <span>@test</span> <span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>df</span><span>,</span> <span>features</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>df</span>

    <span># Check easy_query gives the same results as long form</span>
    <span>@test</span> <span>easy_query</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>,</span> <span>table</span><span>,</span> <span>features</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>df</span>

    <span>resp2</span> <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>resp</span><span>,</span> <span>resp</span><span>])</span>
    <span>@test</span> <span>resp2</span> <span>isa</span> <span>AbstractResponse</span>
    <span>@test</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>,</span> <span>resp</span><span>)</span> <span>isa</span> <span>DataFrame</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="why">Why?</h4>

<p>The test suite puts the power to define the API back into the hands of the interface package.
A package using these tests can be trusted to have defined the functions we need in the form that we expect, so long as the tests pass.
When the interface package changes, the failing tests will serve as a sign to update all related packages to stay consistent with the interface.</p>

<p>The test suite is also handy for creating new implementations.
The test suite is ready-made to be used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test-driven development</a> and helps clear up any ambiguities that might exist in the docstrings.</p>

<h3 id="the-test-fake">The Test Fake</h3>

<h4 id="how-1">How?</h4>

<p>Test fakes are a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_double">test double</a>.
They have a working implementation but take some shortcuts, which makes them suitable only for testing functionality.
Ideally, a test fake should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be easy to construct.</li>
  <li>Only enact the minimum expectations of the API for the abstract type.</li>
  <li>Give easily verifiable outputs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Test fakes should be used in tests for any package using the abstract type in order to avoid depending on any “real” version.</p>

<p>Below we show what a lazy implementation of a test fake for the database example might look like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span><span> FakeDB</span> <span>&lt;:</span> <span>AbstractDB</span>
    <span>data</span><span>::</span><span>Dict</span><span>{</span><span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>DataFrame</span><span>}</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>struct</span><span> FakeResponse</span> <span>&lt;:</span> <span>AbstractResponse</span>
    <span>fetched</span><span>::</span><span>DataFrame</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>FakeDB</span><span>(</span><span>data_dir</span><span>::</span><span>Path</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>FakeDB</span><span>(</span><span>populate_data</span><span>(</span><span>data_dir</span><span>))</span>

<span>function</span><span> query</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>::</span><span>FakeDB</span><span>,</span> <span>table</span><span>::</span><span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>features</span><span>::</span><span>Vector</span><span>{</span><span>Feature</span><span>})</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>db</span><span>[</span><span>table</span><span>]</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>FakeResponse</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>,</span> <span>features</span><span>))</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>::</span><span>FakeDB</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>::</span><span>FakeResponse</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>fetched</span>
<span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>::</span><span>FakeDB</span><span>,</span> <span>rs</span><span>::</span><span>Vector</span><span>{</span><span>FakeResponse</span><span>})</span> <span>=</span> <span>join</span><span>(</span><span>fetch</span><span>.</span><span>(</span><span>rs</span><span>)</span><span>…</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To make sure things are consistent, the <code>test_interface</code> function from the section above should be run on <code>FakeDB</code> as part of the tests for <code>AbstractDB</code>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article lang="en">
    

    <div>
  

<p>Let me tell you the story of a very successful company that made a very big, dumb decision.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We don’t hire junior developers or interns…if you don’t get a puppy, you don’t have to clean up its messes.</p>

<p>~ <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-aren%E2%80%99t-there-interns-at-Netflix">Netflix</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m flabbergasted that some corporate schmuck figured out a way to cast puppies in a negative light and people kept listening. I mean, puppies are the purest beings on planet Earth. Literally made out of playtime and fur. Bright spots in a lonely world. But I digress.</p>

<p>A lot of companies have followed suit with a “we only hire seniors” strategy. When asked why, they’ll offer responses like:</p>

<ul>
<li>We don’t have the time or resources to hire junior developers; we’re moving too quickly.</li>
<li>The company can afford senior developers, so there’s no need to hire juniors.</li>
<li>We can’t afford to make mistakes at this point. The stakes are too high.</li>
<li>Our organization gives a lot of autonomy to its employees. We aren’t set up for the kind of hand-holding that juniors need.</li>
<li>We want to get our base software product in place before we hire anyone inexperienced.</li>
</ul>

<p>The implication here is that junior developers are a liability, something that a company takes on out of a sense of duty or because of an ailing budget. And the implication of <em>that</em> is, well, maybe other companies can afford to do corporate charity projects and substandard work, but <em>we</em> sure can’t.</p>

<p>By the way, there are <a href="https://www.selectusa.gov/software-and-information-technology-services-industry-united-states">over 100,000</a> tech companies in the US, and I’ve never heard <em>one</em> single CEO say “our mistakes don’t matter a lot” or “we need a way to spend some of this loose cash we’ve got sitting around.” So, all you “senior developer only” outfits, whatever shortcut you think you’re taking, whatever system you think you’re cheating, the reality is that you’ve hallucinated the entire thing. There’s no competitive advantage to shutting out juniors. And you’ve outed yourself as a poorly-managed company.</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hostility to junior developers is an easy way to spot a toxic company culture.</p>— April Wensel (@aprilwensel) <a href="https://twitter.com/aprilwensel/status/892398893203202048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 1, 2017</a></blockquote>



<p>The way you hire and treat junior developers is a valuable proxy measure for the health of your organization, your product line, and your internal culture. Senior developers know this. And if that isn’t compelling enough, hiring a fair balance of junior developers is a smart financial decision as well.</p>

<h3 id="preventing-messes">Preventing messes</h3>

<p>If you refuse to hire junior developers because they make “messes,” you’re sending a strong and unintended message about your company culture: no mistakes allowed. You’re painting yourself as the company that fires somebody every time a server goes down. Regardless of how much you pay, nobody wants to work in an environment where job security is touch-and-go. And trying to initimidate developers into making less mistakes spreads a culture of fear and initimidation, which is disastrous for mental health and productivity.</p>

<p>You might argue that this attitude encourages developers to be cautious and implement processes that guard against error: automated testing, QA, failovers, access protection, and reversible code changes, to name a few. But this theory is entirely backwards. If company guidelines encourage the use of failsafes like these and the company provides the time and resources for developers to implement them, the “no mistakes allowed” culture isn’t necessary or valuable; most issues will be caught long before they reach production. And every developer, junior and senior, thrives in an environment where strong development processes protect them from worst-case scenarios.</p>

<p>What about the errors that make it past every layer of prevention you’ve put in place? Think of them as valuable opportunities to shore up your defenses. Junior developers, admittedly, usually uncover these opportunities sooner than senior developers. So the only question is, do you want to debug your process sooner or do you want to debug it later? “Never” is not a choice, as any experienced developer will tell you. If something can go wrong, eventually it will. No amount of experience can prevent human error.</p>

<p>Naturally, you’ll need a few senior development and ops leaders to lay the groundwork and set precedents for an error-resistant development cycle. Nobody’s saying you should <em>only</em> hire junior developers. But if you truly have a workplace that cares about mistakes–that is, a workplace where mistakes are caught early and often–junior developers will fit right in. And developers of all levels will enjoy higher job satisfaction, since error resistance liberates them to build great software (instead of constant firefighting) and protects their nights and weekends.</p>

<h3 id="saving-money">Saving money</h3>

<p>According to Indeed, a <a href="https://www.indeed.com/salaries/Junior-Software-Engineer-Salaries">Junior Software Engineer</a> makes an average salary of $55,394, while a <a href="https://www.indeed.com/salaries/Senior-Software-Engineer-Salaries">Senior Software Engineer</a> makes an average salary of $117,374. A Senior costs more than two times as much as a Junior.</p>

<p>The cost is often justified. Senior developers are expected to be more productive than junior developers. That’s not the whole story, though, and thoughtlessly writing it off as the cost of doing business is both lazy and expensive.</p>

<p>Not all application code requires years of experience to write, or even to write well. Every program includes “glue code” that connects various inputs and outputs in a mundane way. It doesn’t matter a lot who writes it. You can pay someone $28 an hour to do it, or you can pay someone $59 an hour to do it. Either way it will come out about the same. If you only hire seniors, you’re paying a premium for a great deal of entry-level work.</p>

<p>Code also varies significantly from application to application, and familiarity is a key factor in productivity. In most cases, a junior developer with six months of experience on a team will be more effective than a senior developer who just signed on, for no other reason than familiarity with the domain.</p>

<p>The aforementioned glue code and domain-specific code account for at least half of all development work. What remains is code that truly demands and benefits from the expertise of a senior developer. And even for this code, a junior developer can do outstanding work if they have access to sufficient educational resources and the guidance of an experienced mentor.</p>

<p>For these reasons, a pairing of one junior and one senior developer is generally equivalent to two senior developers, and comes at less than 75% of the total cost. If your goal is maximum productivity for minimal expense, this junior/senior pair should be the fundamental molecule of your organization.</p>

<p>As an aside, one factor that’s impossible to account for in these numbers is the widespread tendency of senior developers to debate about topics that end up being trivial–such as algorithms, microsecond optimizations, and code style. If an organization hires only seniors and doesn’t have a rock-solid decision-making process in place, hundreds of payroll hours can be lost to these arguments. Junior developers rarely have this kind of problem.</p>

<h3 id="building-careers">Building careers</h3>

<p>If you don’t hire junior developers, another message you’re sending is that you don’t know how career progression works.</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sometimes when companies say they're not hiring junior developers I want to shake them by their hoodies and yell, where do you think senior developers come from?!</p>— Kate Heddleston (@heddle317) <a href="https://twitter.com/heddle317/status/1040061861817868288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 13, 2018</a></blockquote>



<p>Again, this isn’t about corporate citizenship or “doing your part” in the tech community. This is about making your company a decent place to work so that developers will join your company and stay long enough to make an impact.</p>

<p>I’ve heard a few developers say “I’m done changing job titles. I just want to be a senior developer forever.” However, I’ve never heard one say “I hope I never get a pay raise or learn something new or get recognized for my achievements ever again.” And, inconveniently, the resources necessary to sustain ambitious ladder-climbers and complacent but passionate senior developers are about the same. You need ways to measure and recognize a job well done, plentiful educational resources, and a variety of projects young and old in your development pipeline. You need to create a sense of progress, even for those few who don’t want a promotion.</p>

<p>But don’t get stuck on those folks. They’re a minority. Most people in tech aren’t planning on being senior developers for 40 years straight. We dream of being software architects, team leads, CTOs, and founders. And a company that advertises its blatant disinterest in career progression is going to rank dead last on our list of prospective employers.</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I only recruit senior devs.</p><p>The trick is, I recruit some of them earlier in their career.</p></div>— Reginald Braithwaite (@raganwald) <a href="https://twitter.com/raganwald/status/1041714965781073920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2018</a></blockquote>



<p>One of the most impressive things a developer can hear as they walk into a job interview is, “Hi, I’m a team lead, I’ve worked here for eight years and I joined the company as an intern.” Impressive and very rare. That person is intensely valuable to the company–they know the product line in and out, they’ve seen code from every project within a 100-yard radius, and they’ve worked alongside everyone in the organization. They can innovate within that company in a way that very few can. And the company is earning inestimable dividends on that person’s work because they figured out how to keep them interested for eight years–about one tenth of their life expectancy. That’s a sign of success for the company’s culture. It marks a workplace where morale is high, good work is recognized, and interesting projects are waiting around every corner.</p>

<p>Saying “we don’t hire juniors,” on the other hand, is an open admission that your company isn’t prepared to be part of someone’s career. It essentially advertises stagnancy: the company expects experienced and talented developers to join the company and contribute indefinitely while getting nothing but a paycheck for their efforts. Some might be willing to do that, but you’ll never see their best work.</p>

<p><strong>4 November 2020 | Luis F. De Pombo, David Ellis</strong></p>
<p>Can we write programs with predictable execution that could be automatically parallelized? Part of the work of Alan Turing and Alonzo Church on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability">computability</a> demonstrated that for some programs it cannot be determined ahead of time whether or not the program can be computed. This constitutes the crux of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">Halting Problem</a>. This "Turing-Completeness Problem" is not an issue with what they have shown, but how the software development process is hindered by the lack of assurances on computability and our industry's lack of recognition of the burden this has put onto software developers. Further, it has been exacerbated by recent computing mechanisms, such as multithreading, NUMA, GPGPU, and distributed computing, which have moved away from the "single tape" Turing Machine model of computation that most programming languages are founded upon.</p>
<p>The following snippet of C code succinctly contains the problems of Turing completeness complicating modern development:</p>
<pre><code>while (node) {
  doSomethingWith(node);
  node = node-&gt;next;
}
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li><em>Automatic Parallelization</em> - It's not possible to automatically parallelize this code. The number of nodes is not clear to the compiler for it to potentially bunch those calls across threads, and it's also unclear if the function call mutates the node and adds/removes nodes to process.</li>
<li><em>Halting Problem</em> - It's not possible to know if the code will halt, even ignoring the idea that <code>doSomethingWith</code> may always add a new <code>node</code> to the one it is processing, there's nothing stopping a node from pointing at itself and never halting that way.</li>
</ol>
<p>Automatic parallelization is only a problem because we want/need to parallelize our code. Until very recently this was a niche need as <a href="https://www.karlrupp.net/2015/06/40-years-of-microprocessor-trend-data/">computing power had been increasing exponentially for decades and has only flattened in the past decade</a>. If this was still the case it is likely that it would have remained a niche problem that only experts need to worry about, but with multicore now the norm even in personal laptops and unlikely to go away as <a href="http://www.fisgeo.unipg.it/luca.gammaitoni/fisinfo/documenti-fisici/physical-limits-silicon.pdf">signal propagation itself becomes the limiting factor</a>, it has become a problem for the average developer, as well.</p>
<p>The issue with the Halting Problem itself is much more contentious. Turing demonstrated that it is not possible to determine whether arbitrary compute will halt or run forever so this lack of determinism has been tolerated as an unfortunate reality of all compute that must simply be dealt with. However, we posit that no <em>practially useful</em> computation will take forever because its result cannot affect the finite reality of our lives, so programmers have already been finding an imperfect subset of Turing completeness for their own problem domains in an ad-hoc intuitive sense to be able to actually produce valuable calculations for their users.</p>
<p>In a single-threaded world, this problem has been mostly a small annoyance -- on those occasions where you have written infinitely-looping code, find the section of code that the processor is executing over and over again, study how it entered this state, and figure out how to prevent that state from occurring again -- or abort on detection of said state. But in a multi-threaded, multi-machined cluster computing world, on those occasions where you have written an infinite loop, even detecting an infinite loop that spans multiple machines is a challenge, let alone gathering the data you need to debug the cause of this invalid state. This is further exacerbated by the non-determinism inherent to multiple interacting Turing machines not executing in lockstep with each other making reproduction of the problem even more difficult.</p>
<p>Side-stepping the Halting Problem by defining a barely-Turing-incomplete subset, also makes the automatic parallelization story possible. Now the compiler can work with code that it can determine where and how it could parallelize the work and has the ability to model its finite execution time to determine whether or not parallelization is worth it under various conditions.</p>
<p>This is the thesis of <a href="https://github.com/alantech/alan">the Alan programming language</a>, that with minor syntax constraints (that we believe the vast majority of developers will not notice, or at least won't mind) we can be sure that the code you write always halts, and we can parallelize your code for you. We can make models for runtime estimates at compile time that only require the size and "shape" of the data to get an answer and can therefore determine not only how to parallelize your code, but whether or not it makes sense given the data being operated on. We have not yet accomplished all of these claims, but this is now only a matter of time and effort. :)</p>
<p>The root of most of the problems with the example C code involves the ambiguity in the data structure and the behavior of the user-defined function. The other problem is that the while loop is an unbounded looping construct that cannot be reasoned about except "the body of the while loop is executed zero or more times." In Alan, <em>arbitrary</em> looping and recursion are disallowed, and all data is built on top of data types with knowable constraints, no arbitrary JUMP statements or data pointer logic allowed.</p>
<p>What this means in practice is that instead of writing that while loop above for your list of nodes, you would write something like:</p>
<pre><code>nodes.each(doSomethingWith)
</code></pre>
<p>Your intent to perform a side-effect action on each of the nodes in the list is clear, and the Alan compiler can determine the "purity" of the function -- whether or not it mutates the input argument or an outer scope -- to determine if it <em>could</em> execute the operations in parallel. Then at runtime it can use the estimated execution time of the function, the number of nodes in the <code>nodes</code> array, and the cost to distribute that work across multiple threads, to decide <em>if</em> it will execute the operations in parallel.</p>
<p>This can even apply across simple sequentially-written lines of code:</p>
<pre><code>fn example(file1: string, file2: string): Array&lt;Array&lt;int64&gt;&gt; {
  const matrix1 = loadFile(file1).parseMatrix()
  const matrix2 = loadFile(file2).parseMatrix()
  return matrix1 * matrix2
}
</code></pre>
<p>Not only is the matrix multiplication a trivially parallelizable operation that likely will be parallelized for any large-ish matrix, but reading the files from disk and then parsing their contents may be done in parallel before the matrix multiplication because the performance benefit is there to do so.</p>
<p>To accomplish automatic parallelization, we need something different from a classic Turing tape to compile to. We call this the Alan Graphcode: a bytecode format with graph annotations that is guaranteed to have no cycles. A dependency graph of operations to perform, with some of these also having a subgraph of operations to perform, provides us with the information we need to know which operations are safe to execute in parallel, coupled with (implied) operation execution time estimates to determine if it makes sense to do so.</p>
<p>Alan's acyclic graphcode seems incompatible with any sort of control flow at first glance, though, since a dependency graph of operations that must all be executed appears to preclude the behavior of <code>JUMP</code> operations, like the classic <a href="https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/X86-assembly/Instructions/jnz">JNZ (Jump if Not Zero)</a>. <a href="https://github.com/alantech/alan">Alan</a> allows <code>if</code> statements and even <a href="https://docs.alan-lang.org/std_seq.html">guaranteed halting versions of classic looping constructs are in a standard library</a> that provide a predictable "worst case" execution time based on a maximum iteration count allowed. We will demonstrate how Alan allows control flow with a graph-based representation that makes automatic parallelization possible.</p>
<p><img src="https://alan-lang.org/turing-tape.png" alt="Turing Tape Example with JNZ"></p>
<p>Here two operations <code>OP1</code> and <code>OP2</code> run, then a <code>JNZ</code> runs. If the check is not zero, it skips to only run <code>OP5</code> and <code>OP6</code>, otherwise it runs <code>OP3</code> and <code>OP4</code> before running <code>OP5</code> and <code>OP6</code>.</p>
<p>This is a basic if statement for something like:</p>
<pre><code>var a = op1();
var b = op2(a);
if (b) {
  var c = op3();
  a = op4(c);
}
var d = op5(a);
return op6(d);
</code></pre>
<p>The equivalent representation in a graph would be something like:</p>
<p><img src="https://alan-lang.org/graph-if.png" alt="Graph Example with if"></p>
<p>Here, the conditional call is a special <code>COND</code> node that may or may not execute the specified graph named <code>if</code>. All of the nodes of the main graph are executed, but the <code>COND</code> operation may or may not execute the inner subgraph. There is absolutely no parallelization possible based on the set of dependencies, but it's clear that <code>OP5</code> can't run until both <code>OP1</code> and <code>COND(if)</code> are run.</p>
<p>Back to classic Turing machines, what is the opposite of an <code>if</code> statement in a Turing tape? It's not <code>else if</code> or <code>else</code> as those are just other forward jumps on different conditions. The opposite of an <code>if</code> is a <code>do-while</code> statement, because that is a jump <em>backwards</em>. </p>
<p><img src="https://alan-lang.org/turing-loop.png" alt="Turing Tape Example with JNZ-based loop"></p>
<pre><code>var a = op1();
var b = op2(a);
do {
  var c = op3();
  a = op4(c);
  var d = op5(a);
} while (d);
op6(a);
</code></pre>
<p>The equivalent in a graph representation would be:</p>
<p><img src="https://alan-lang.org/graph-loop.png" alt="Graph Example with do-while loop"></p>
<p>Here a <code>DOWHILE</code> opcode runs the loop sub-graph over and over until the expected condition is met. So with these two special opcodes <code>COND</code> and <code>DOWHILE</code> we can reproduce the behavior of <code>JNZ</code>'s forwards and backwards jumping and we can enter infinite loops with <code>DOWHILE</code>, meaning we should be Turing Complete.</p>
<p>So how do we make this barely <em>not</em> Turing complete? We make a list/array type a first class citizen in the VM itself and then we only add operations that know the bounds that they are to operate on based on that list or some other condition that cannot be <em>directly</em> mutated by the user's own code.</p>
<p>Now for an array of data we can have an <code>each</code> opcode that applies a given sub-graph of operations to every node in the array. The Alan runtime, or AVM, can tell based on the expected execution time of the graph and the number of nodes and the cost to send that data to multiple threads whether or not to do a fork-join or not. Probably no for 10 elements and probably yes for 10 billion, but where's the threshold and why? That's something better left for a computer to decide in realtime …</p></main></div></div></div></div>

<h3>Good software design – Introduction</h3>
<p>To write useful and long term maintainable software we tend to look out for patterns and group them into abstractions and it seems that’s the case for devs behind Linux and FFmpeg too.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Software design</h4>
<p>When we’re creating software, we’re building data structures and defining their behaviors and dependencies. The way we create and link them can be seen as the design/architecture of the software.</p>
<p>Let’s say we’re building a media framework that encodes/decodes video and audio. The codecs <a href="https://aomedia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AV1</a>, H264, HEVC, and AAC all do some common operations and if we can provide a <strong>generic abstraction that holds these common operations</strong> and data we can use this concept <strong>instead of</strong> relying on the concrete idea of what <strong>a specific codec</strong> does.</p></blockquote>
<p>Through the years many&nbsp;<a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-quality-worth-cost.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developers noticed that software with a good design</a>&nbsp;is a good idea that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pays off as software grows in complexity</a>.</p>
<p>This is one of the ideas behind the good design for software, to rely on <strong>components</strong> that are <strong>weakly linked</strong> and with <strong>boundaries</strong> around <strong>what it should do</strong>.</p>
<h3>Ruby</h3>
<p>Maybe it’s easier to see all these concepts in practice. Let’s code a quick pseudo media stream framework that provides&nbsp;encoding&nbsp;and&nbsp;decoding&nbsp;for several codecs.</p>

<p>This pseudo-code in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruby</a> tries to recreate what we’re discussing above, there is an <strong>implicit concept here</strong> of what operations a codec must have, in this case, the operations are <em>encode</em> and&nbsp;<em>decode</em>. Since&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruby is a dynamically typed language</a>&nbsp;any class can present these two operations and act as a codec&nbsp;for us.</p>
<blockquote><p>Developers sometimes may use the words: contract, API, interface, behavior and operations as synonyms.</p></blockquote>
<p>This design might be considered good because if we want to add a new codec we just need to provide an implementation and add it to the list, even the list could be built in a dynamic way but the idea is that this code seems easy to extend and maintain because it tries to keep link between the components weak (<strong>low coupling</strong>) and each component does only what it should do (<strong>cohese</strong>).</p>
<blockquote><p>Rails framework even enforce some way to organize the code, it adopts the model-view-controller (MVC) architecture</p></blockquote>
<h3>Golang</h3>
<p>When we go (no pun intended) to a <strong>statically typed language</strong>&nbsp;like&nbsp;<a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">golang</a>&nbsp;we need to be more formal, describing the required types but it’s still doable.</p>

<blockquote><p>The <a href="https://medium.com/golangspec/interfaces-in-go-part-i-4ae53a97479c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interface type in golang</a> is much more powerful than <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/createinterface.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Java’s similar construct</a> because its definition is totally disconnected from the implementation and vice versa.

<blockquote><p>Code inspired by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bottomupcs.com/abstration.xhtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.bottomupcs.com/abstration.xhtml</a></p></blockquote>
<p>We first define the abstract operations (functions in this case) in a <strong>generic&nbsp;struct</strong>&nbsp;and then <strong>we fill it</strong> with the <strong>concrete code</strong>, like the&nbsp;av1&nbsp;decoder and encoder real code.</p>
<p>Many other languages have somewhat <a href="https://clojure.org/reference/protocols" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar mechanisms</a> to dispatch methods or functions as if they were part of an agreed protocol and then the system integration code can deal only with this high-level abstractions.</p>
<h3>Linux Kernel – Everything is a file</h3>
<p>Have you ever heard the expression&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everything is a file in Linux</a>? The idea is to have a common interface for all kinds of resources in Linux, for instance, Linux handles network socket, special files (like&nbsp;/<a href="https://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/proc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proc</a>/cpuinfo) or even USB devices as files.</p>
<p>This is a powerful idea that can make easy to write or use programs for linux since we can rely in a set of well known operations from this <strong>abstraction called file</strong>. Let’s see this in action:</p>

<p>For the input files, FFmpeg creates a struct called&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/libavformat/avformat.h#L640" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AVInputFormat</a>&nbsp;that is implemented by any format (video container) that wants to be used as an input.&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/libavformat/matroskadec.c#L4229" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MKV files fill this structure with</a> its implementation as the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/libavformat/mov.c#L7997" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MP4 format</a>&nbsp;too.</p>

</div><p>This design allows new codecs, formats, and protocols to be integrated and released easier. <a href="https://code.videolan.org/videolan/dav1d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DAV1d</a> (an av1 open-source implementation) was integrated into FFmpeg May this year and&nbsp;<a href="https://git.ffmpeg.org/gitweb/ffmpeg.git/commitdiff/beaa350e24167f4ff31275a6114693f5ce7cd409" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can follow along the commit diff</a>&nbsp;to see how easy it was.

        </p><div>
                  <p>How do clients know if you are the right developers for their job? how do they find you? How do they learn to trust you? The answer to all these questions is, as you might guess, you reference or commonly known as your portfolio. It's generally a list of websites/applications you worked on. Over time your references are supposed to grow giving bigger chances to convince future employers or customers on what you can do and the type of projects you have already worked on.</p>

<p>Some of the most frequent questions employers ask when they interview you are to tell them a bit about yourself, and the second is to require your portfolio. It's an important piece of information which serves as your back up. Most employers and customers would even try to find and go through your portfolio before you even get to interact with them.</p>

<p>I quite remember some years back a friend said something touching to me. He said this to:  <strong>zooboole, you always present the same portfolio every year.</strong> </p>

<p>From 2002 to now, if I had even 10% of the projects I worked on alive, I would look insane in the eye of the average person. </p>

<p><em>That friend and I as well had no idea that portfolios must be maintained over time.</em> I write this post today to educate anyone who might not be aware of this subtle information. </p>

<p>Like any other thing in this life, time is a big threat to your reference. It sucks away everything. A few problems start to rise to cause your references to dying over time:</p>

<h2>- Most of the websites start to die.</h2>

<p>Either the owner does not want to maintain it anymore or the hosting expires and they don't bother/can't afford to renew.</p>

<h2>- The technologies you used "are dead" or are no more relevant in the professional field</h2>

<p>Technologies evolve and new ones pop up every single day. When you become too good at one, and suddenly another one comes to dominate the market share, you find yourself in the lifted side of the scale.</p>

<h2>- You lose the control</h2>

<p>Sometimes clients can decide to change their developer. Although you were the one who built and maybe was maintaining their website, they may decide to go away with you and handle the work over to a different person or to a new team. From there you have no control over how the project will become. As time goes, you start to realize that your work is disappearing, and you can't refer to it as your work anymore.</p>

<h2>- Privacy policies and private projects</h2>

<p>Some deals prohibit you from showing or even talking about them. You will usually sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement before starting such projects. Or, due to competition, you can't mention your them as your previous projects. I remember being at Jumia for an interview, and at the moment I mentioned that I worked at SuperPrice, I became suspicious. It feels like you are there to spy, or just to harm the organization...</p>

<p>I remember building some applications that one cannot be really proud of. What it means is that such applications are not necessarily healthy for everyone... I also built some that are private and proper to just one person.</p>

<h2>- Your magic wand skills</h2>

<p>There are other few skills you can't talk about with the majority of people. although you might be good at it and you have been building with them, you just can't say it out loud. Some good examples are your dark hacking skills, dark SEO tricks, cracking adobe cs6 (wink), etc.</p>

<h2>Commentary</h2>

<p>I know some of you might tell me to show the works in the localhost. Yes, we do that. But it's not always enough. That option means you must physically meet the client or the employer, and that's not always possible. Also, such people would not believe or value a project you show from your personal computer.</p>

<p>I also hope people in charge of employing developer consider some of these points to investigate candidates in a fair way.</p>

<h2>Your take away</h2>

<p>If you have not quit the job yet, or you are starting, it's important that you consider all those aspects I just spoke about. In addition, you can go on your own adventure and add a few experiences to your belt. To accompany you, here are a few suggestions I would like to give you:</p>

<h2>-- Work on durable ideas</h2>

<p>Try as much as possible to find projects that can live long enough. This implies making sure that the client is serious about their business and that the business heavily depends on the project you are building for them.</p>

<h2>-- Build some personal projects and maintain them</h2>

<p>You might not always have someone to work for, thus build something for yourself.</p>

<h2>-- Help clients to remain committed</h2>

<p>For some of your clients that are not well motivated about their projects, help them understand the projects' value and the importance to have the application you build for them. For example, you could help them renew their domain names when they go through tough times.</p>

<h2>-- Work for conscious clients or conscientize them before the job</h2>

<p>I call conscious clients those who know exactly WHY they need their project. Sometimes, they already have the application and just need you to improve it. Some have experience with the idea of using software and its advantages.</p>

<h2>-- <strong>Build something every year, at least a personal project.</strong></h2>

<p>This is my personal new resolution. It's one of the solutions I have found to fix this issue of our dying portfolios. Get to insert a new raw of projects in your resume every year. Find an idea of the project as a personal project and build it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Why are 'cold emails' ... cold?</p>
<p>That's because <a href="https://akhilkg.me/blog/serendipity">serendipity</a> in real-life comes at a premium. </p>
<p>You have to be at the right place, at the right time to strike gold. You will need to jump over loops, be able to get favours, tackle people and conversations to get what you want - and in the end, this would just get you a 1-2 minute conversation with someone important. The fancy term for this is “warm introductions”.</p>
<p>'Online' serendipity - like many things 'online' - is straightforward. You are "only” an email away from a potential investor, a mentor, or a customer. </p>
<p>Nothing beats getting a warm introduction to someone but cold emails don't have to be "cold". They can be warm. </p>
<p>Let me give you two personal examples of not-so-cold emails - one which worked and one which didn’t. The emails went to two of my favourite startup people when I was trying to collect and organise my thoughts around an idea.</p>
<hr>
<p>Your 'warm' emails should take you a lot of time to write, which is good. Each email has its own set of characteristics depending on whom you are sending it to  i.e. here, your motive with warm emails is to build a long term relationship with the person you are sending it to.</p>
<p>And so, the receiver should feel that you have done your homework and you are not someone who is just sending the same mail to a lot of people and expecting to get a response.</p>
<p>At its heart, it's just talking your heart out - nothing else. No fancy salesmanship or trying to impress. </p>
<p>The best warm emails are honest, actionable, and waste no time for the reader. There is no fluff nor beating around the bush and ideally, it wouldn’t even cross 2 or 3 paragraphs.</p>
<p>For my first mail that worked, it started with an incredibly personal and heartfelt message. I had been following this person's content for last 5-6 years or so. He has had an impact on my viewpoint of the world much more than any other figure at the time and I believe it was his answers that sowed the seeds for entrepreneurship early on.</p>
<p>The best warm emails you will write will be automatically for the people who you believe the most in,- you will be at the most genuine, honest version of yourself  - just like how water flows inevitably through a bed of rocks - this works almost always.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/98252728-44892880-1fa0-11eb-90f9-d9f2ef37bf65.jpg"></p><p>Watch the subject line, it is eye-catching. From his perspective, it’s actually relatable. The receiver in this case is a popular writer on Quora and as was described in one of his answers - at one point, he was a 'young follower' himself. The rest of the email described my startup where I asked him for his feedback.
This worked and he responded.</p>
<p>Also, note that the platform you use matters a lot. Use the platform where the receiver is less likely to be bombarded by random strangers / where the receiver has a lot of followers. For this guy, the worst place to send him the mail would have been on Quora.</p>
<p>For the one that didn’t work - the principles remained the same but I focused too much on “getting help” rather than “connecting” - it started with this:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/98252734-4652ec00-1fa0-11eb-88c2-3ae94eea6e4c.jpg"></p><p>And this was at the end:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/98252740-46eb8280-1fa0-11eb-9c09-dff29cb7ac86.jpg"></p><p>Reading it now, it just feels like a cooked up half-assed effort to get some feedback.</p>
<hr>
<p>Takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect with the person on a deeper level to whom you are sending to. Read their tweets, read all of their blog posts, see what they have built. Come to appreciate a thing or two about the person whom you are sending it to - you can’t write well if you don’t feel it.</li>
<li>Be genuine &amp; expect nothing and no, not even a response. Sounds counter-intuitive, but it works :) I’m not saying don’t ask for help, ask for help - but at the same time, you should be okay without their help as well. Try your best.</li>
<li>Mind the platform. Use the platform which the person expects something important to come through. You could also try multiple times but don’t spam.</li>
<li>Make sure your content is actionable &amp; clear. Ensure your email/message will be opened from its first line/subject. If you ask for too much, the person might just think “Okay, I will respond to this person later” and you end up never getting a response. Instead, ask for something short and sweet, and from there you can build a conversation.</li>
</ul></div></div>]]>

<p>In <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/databases">part 1</a> of this series, we'll use the Persistent library and Template Haskell to create a simple database schema. This will enable us to run migrations with ease. It will also allow us to write some simple type safe SQL queries!</p>

<p>Once we have our database set up, we'll want to serve the information we're storing over a web API. We'll do this with the Servant library. Servant allows us to build endpoints that retrieve their query parameters in a type-safe way! Find out how in <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/servant">part 2</a> of the series!</p>

<p>Now that we have our API set up, we'll see how we can make it faster by adding a Redis cache! We'll learn how to use the Redis bindings for Haskell so we can avoid using the database for some of our queries! See how it all works in <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/redis">part 3</a>.</p>

<p>Our end-to-end system is now quite complicated, so testing it is difficult for a variety of reasons. In <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/docker">part 4</a>, we'll see some techinques to test our web API. We'll also use Docker to make this process easier.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/esqueleto">final part</a> of our Real World Haskell series, we'll learn some more about advanced SQL queries. We'll extend our schema and use the Esqueleto library to perform type safe joins between our different data types!</p>

<p>This series goes over some cool libraries, but there's still so much more to explore! Check out our <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/production-checklist">Production Checklist</a> and explore a ton of other libraries you can use for various tasks when making a production system in Haskell!</p>

<p>This week, as an addendum to our four(and a half)-part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/18/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-mining/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/25/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-trees-for-blooms/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/02/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iii-hammer-time/">III</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/09/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iva-steel-yourself/">IVa</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/16/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ivb-work-hardening-or-hardly-working/">IVb</a>) look at pre-modern iron and steel production, we’re going to look at two alternative regional processes, where they fit into the entire iron production process that we detailed already, how they worked and what kind of product they produced.  In particular, we are going to look at the early production of cast iron in China, and the production of a form of crucible steel, called <em>wootz</em>, in India (and South Asia more broadly).</p>



<p>First, some necessary caveats.  Neither of these methods of iron production were practiced in my core area of research (the greater Mediterranean world during the Hellenistic and Roman periods), although <em>wootz</em> steel was imported in small quantities during that time and a handful of cast iron goods produced in China also made it to the broader Roman or Hellenistic world (though very, <em>very</em> few).  Consequently my knowledge here is much thinner and I am much more reliant on reporting the work of other scholars.  Moreover, some of the scholarship on these topics is in languages I do not read, so I am also reliant on other scholars for that.  As such, this is going to be a much more general discussion of these processes and I am going to be a bit more cautious about what I say about them.  At the same time, I simply don’t have the information to talk much about the details of the lives of the iron-workers here themselves, like I could in the previous posts, so this will mostly focus on process and product, rather than people.</p>



<p>That said, I thought this was still worth doing because it seems like there is quite a bit of unhelpful ‘mystique’ surrounding both.  On the one hand, a lot of the discussion of the production of cast iron in China fails to really put the innovation both in the correct spot in the iron production process but also in the correct context in terms of the development of iron-working technology.  On the other hand, much of the popular discussion about <em>wootz</em> steel in India treats it as this quasi-legendary ‘lost’ and mysterious production process when it is, in fact, a fairly well understood method of producing high-quality steel.</p>



<p>And of course, as always, if you want to support my essay production process, you can do so via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a> and by sharing to my work to a wider audience (but please do not copy-and-repost these essays; link to them instead).  And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings (and I promise fewer political musings now that the electoral<em> <em>götterdämmerung</em></em> has come and – heavens I hope by the time this post goes live – gone).</p>






<p>(Subsequent edit: Due to some election-related trolling coming from off-site, I had to prune back the comments to the original topic.  Apologies for those whose comments were pruned (except the troll) but I wanted to keep us on topic and away from the abyss of endless political carping.)</p>



<h2>Cast Iron in China</h2>



<p>Now I’ve stated several times during this series that generally speaking the bloomeries used to smelt iron in the pre-modern period were not capable of reaching the high temperatures (1538 °C) required to actually melt iron and instead produced pure metallic iron through solid state reduction (that is, the bloomery process) along with, essentially, melting everything that <em>wasn’t</em> iron out of the bloom.  And for most of the world in most of the pre-modern period, this is true.</p>



<p><strong>China appears to be the odd exception</strong>.  I should note that this is an area of scholarship that is still quite active – dates are still in flux (shifting back as new discoveries push back the earliest dates) and the exact nature of the transitions from bronze-working to iron-working in China and the degree to which the bloomery processes we’ve discussed served as an intermediate stage is still debated, as far as I know.  A fair bit of the discussion of the question is, unsurprisingly, in Chinese, which I cannot read.  So I am doing my best to provide a summary of what I know.</p>

<p>Cast iron in China seems to become widespread during the Warring States period (453-221), though the technology itself probably had its genesis in the earlier Spring and Autumn period (770-454) and it becomes truly ubiquitous during the early Qin-Han Period (221 BC – 220 AD).  The general working hypothesis based on the evidence is that the cast iron product emerged not out of bloomery iron production (which seems to have been used in China side-by-side with cast iron production for the first couple of centuries) but instead out of the furnace techniques already in use for casting objects in copper-alloy (read: bronze), until the cast iron process became able to produce a high enough quality iron product that it supplanted bloomery production, probably in the last century BC. Again, those dates are very approximate and seem to me to still be significantly unsettled, going by the range I’ve seen in scholarship (the most recent I could find on this was “Everything Old is new Again?  Rethinking the Transition to Cast Iron production in the Central Plains of China” in <em>Journal of Anthropological Research</em> (2014), so those are the dates I have gone with; Craddock and Tylecote both have somewhat later dates).</p>



<p>The basic interaction of producing cast iron centers around one oddity in carbon-iron alloys: <strong>as you add more carbon to iron, the melting point of the resulting mixture drops</strong>.  At 4.3% carbon content, the melting point of iron drops to just 1150 °C, which <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/25/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-trees-for-blooms/">as you will recall</a>, is very much within reach for pre-modern furnaces worked by bellows (and China seems to have generally had better, hotter furnaces than contemporary pre-modern Europe to boot).  Adding small amounts of either sulfur (typically from coal being used to supply the carbon) or phosphorous can lower the melting point further, although these can also make the metal brittle.  At that point, large, bellows-fed furnaces can heat the iron-carbon mixture up to the point where it melts and becomes sufficiently fluid to cast (slag and other impurities, being lighter, can be drawn out with a flux and tapped off).  <strong>The result is cast iron</strong> (also called ‘pig iron’).</p>



<p>The <em>problem</em>, as we’ve discussed earlier, <strong>is that cast iron</strong> (which, to be clear, iron produced this way is still cast iron, even if you aren’t pouring it into a model; it is a type of iron as will become plain) <strong>comes out of the process with unfavorable characteristics</strong>, particularly in strength, brittleness and malleability – <strong>in short, it is too hard, too weak, and too prone to break and crack rather than bend</strong>.  The carbon content of cast iron is, of course, very high: above 4%, the carbon makes the iron much too hard and inflexible, causing it to become extremely brittle.  In particular, if the silicon content (which is likely to come from bits of slag melting and dissolving into the iron at the high temperatures) is low and the iron is cooled fairly quickly, it forms into cementite, which is hard and brittle.  Cementite isn’t bad in and of itself – <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/16/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ivb-work-hardening-or-hardly-working/">we saw this with heat-treated steel</a>, where just a bit of cementite among the ferrite offered improved strength and hardness.  But this is not just a little cementite, it is <em>lots of cementite</em>.  In excess of 60% cementite, what is sometimes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_iron#White_cast_iron">‘white’ cast iron</a>.  <strong>At these levels, the amount of cementite leaves the cast iron very hard and very brittle, likely to break</strong> <strong>and actually difficult to cast effectively</strong> (because it is likely to crack from thermal stresses as it cools).</p>

Using mechanical assistance like this would have made the furnace operation significantly more labor efficient.</figcaption></figure>



<p>More slowly cooled cast iron with high silicon content, can come as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_iron#Grey_cast_iron">‘grey’ cast iron</a>, which has less cementite, but has instead pockets of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphite"><em>graphite</em> </a>– little pockets of cure crystalline carbon which couldn’t be absorbed into the iron – which have very little strength and essentially functions as cracks within the iron, reducing the overall toughness considerably.  Craddock notes that early Chinese cast iron tends to be grey cast iron, but – curiously – with somewhat lower silicon contents than we’d expect for grey cast iron.  So for almost any tool or weapon use, our cast iron is functionally worthless: too brittle to sustain meaningful stress.  <strong>But we’re not done.</strong></p>



<p><strong>The key technique that Chinese ironworkers seemed to have developed here is <em>malleablisation</em>.</strong>  By heating the iron to melting temperatures (or just below) in an oxidizing environment (which is to say, open to the air) the ironworker can cause a few things to happen.  First, the oxidation process begins to draw off the carbon from the iron (again, you will remember the tendency of heat and air to decarburize iron from<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/09/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iva-steel-yourself/"> our discussion of making steel</a>).  At the same time, the graphite which originally was in long, thin flakes begins to form into more compact round shapes which cause less strain on the metal (there is also just <em>less</em> of that graphite, because it is made of the carbon that the air is drawing off in the decarburization process).  If the iron is kept hot and open to the air long enough, it can either be decarburized to steel or even all of the way to wrought iron, making it usable for tools, weapons, armor and the like.</p>



<p>(I should note that somewhat different processes for removing carbon to make cast iron workable as wrought iron, called <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finery_forge">fining</a></strong>, emerged in late medieval Europe.  This was done at a finery forge (we start to see these as early as the 13th century AD in Europe and involving breaking cast iron into smaller chunks and then heating …</p></div></div>

<p>That title might be clickbait, but it is meant as a nod to the feature parity that has been long in the making between OpenDroneMap relative to more mature projects, whether those more mature projects are the venerable, free and open source MICMAC or its derivatives in the form of the various closed-source offerings in the photogrammetry industry.</p>



<p>So, is 2.1.0 the biggest update yet? I would say it’s the update that suddenly brings us to feature parity in almost all categories. And it all starts with improved structure from motion (updates to OpenSfM), continues through improved point clouds (replacement of MVE with OpenMVS), and finishes with improved (waves at) everything.</p>



<h2>Speed and Structure from Motion</h2>



<p>With the update to the latest OpenSfM, we see a 25-45% speed up in portions of OpenSfM processing. This is very exciting and due to some low level changes, specifically: “reprojection of derivatives … are now computed analytically instead of autodiff-ed”. There are other, subtler improvements to OpenSfM, but that is the feature most noticable to end users.</p>



<h2>Speed and dense point cloud production</h2>



<p>The MVE library has been swapped out for OpenMVS. On the surface, this slows things down: for the same resolution depthmaps, OpenMVS runs at half the speed of MVE. But, the speed comparison is deceptive: we see such a high quality improvement from changing libraries, we can easily run at lower depthmap values and get better results resulting in an effective speed increase, with improved quality.</p>



<h2>Quality improvements</h2>



<p>The biggest noticeable change will be in the quality of point cloud outputs and all subsequent products, from orthophotos to digital surface models, and digital terrain models.</p>

<p>Because the point clouds effect the quality throughout the rest of the toolchain, we see substantially improved digital surface models:</p>

<p>Higher fidelity in point clouds results in better automated point cloud filtering:</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.opendronemap.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7070_dxm.gif" alt=""></figure>



<p>And so on. Updates are committed and out in the wild. It’s time to update your OpenDroneMap instance and have fun with the improved quality and speed.</p>



<h2>How much better?</h2>



<p>So, how much better are these point clouds? How do they compare to the rest of the industry? You don’t have to take our word for it, check out the leaderboard at <a href="https://www.tanksandtemples.org/leaderboard/">tanksandtemples.org</a>.</p>



<p>You’ll find the OpenMVS leads amongst FOSS solutions. Look closely enough, you might find a closed source drone image processing favorite trailing OpenMVS by a large margin… .</p>



<p>(Footnote, these leaderboard comparisons don’t compare the combination of OpenSfM and OpenMVS, but are a decent proxy for a full comparison).</p>



<h2>Is this really bigger than that closed-source product?</h2>



<p>Probably. OpenDroneMap has for more than a year had the benefit of being one of the most scalable solutions, both from a technology perspective with an industry leading process for splitting and recombining datasets, but from the licensing “technology” with licensing that costs the same amount regardless of how many machines it is deployed to.</p>



<p>In 2019, we saw OpenDroneMap process datasets in excess of 30,000 images into a spatially harmonized dataset, something at the edge of the possible at the time. In 2020, we have seen 90,000 image datasets successfully processed in the same way. It might be the largest spatially harmonized dataset yet processed, though we are happy to hear of similar projects in case we are wrong!</p>



<h2>Is this really better than that closed-source product?</h2>



<p>The recent (2 day old) quality improvements don’t just benefit from OpenMVS. OpenSfM does an industry leading job of balancing the accuracy of GPS information with the quality of camera calibration. This means that for massive datasets where you need good 3D data, OpenDroneMap can deliver a good product for things like flood modeling, terrain change detection, and other data needs that are sensitive to three-dimensional fidelity.</p>



<h2>Time to try, try again, or upgrade</h2>



<p>It is probably time for you to upgrade. If you haven’t tried OpenDroneMap before, or if it has been a while, then it is time to try it with your dataset. In the meantime, enjoy these screen shots from data produced by Federico Debetto, KMedia SAS, which just like the Zanzibar Mapping Initiative data above, is from Unguja Island, Zanzibar:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>When we started Repl.it, we set out to remove all friction from getting started with programming. That also meant getting out of the way and letting you code as quickly as possible. As part of that, and for a long time, you could start coding on Repl.it without a user account. </p>
<p>We anticipated that giving free unfettered compute to the universe would be challenging. Still we didn't flinch and made it a point to innovate on sandboxing, security, and anti-abuse tools, and we've been largely successful at that. Today, Repl.it the largest open compute platform on the internet, one where you don't need a credit card or even an account to start executing. We run 150,000 concurrent containers, which is 10x what we used to run last year.</p>
<p>We have our fair share of war stories, like when we had to battle dark-web hackers trying to sell DDoS attacks from our site for Bitcoin. Luckily reCAPTCHA from Google was a massive help, protecting against botting made it possible for us to continue to grow and offer our services for free.</p>
<p>Sadly, earlier this year, Google surprised us that they're going to be charging for reCAPTCHA. Of course, it makes business sense for them, but for a startup like ours, operating at the scale we operate at, it meant that we have to pay them more than we make in monthly revenue<small>[1]</small>.</p>
<p>That leaves us with two choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>leave the site vulnerable to botting and attacks resulting in an immense amount of time spent fighting abuse and risking outages</li>
<li>phase out the anonymous experience and focus our efforts and tools on securing the logged-in user experience</li>
</ul>
<p>We decided to go with the latter, and we hope you'll stick with us and create an account. Beyond the 5 minutes it takes to sign up, there is only an upside to doing so. We don't collect much data, and we respect user privacy. You're also going to unlock many features that were invisible for you in the anonymous experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name and organize your repls</li>
<li><a href="https://repl.it/site/hosting">Host apps and websites</a></li>
<li><a href="https://repl.it/site/multiplayer">Collaborate with others in Multiplayer</a></li>
<li>Claim and build a profile with the repls you're most proud of</li>
<li>Particpate in our <a href="https://repl.it/site/community">community forums</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And many more that we're sure you'll enjoy discovering.</p>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p>Google gave us only one month to move off, so we're going to have to move fast. Here are the changes to expect in the upcoming few weeks: </p>
<ul>
<li>We'll transition our language pages (<code>/languages/{lang_name}</code>) to a barebones REPL with limited opportunity for abuse. That way if you're used to using Repl.it to try out just a bit of code, you can continue to do that without logging in</li>
<li>repl.run, the url endpoint you could access command-line apps will redirect to the repl. repl.run is inherently anonymous, which makes it an attack vector without captcha</li>
<li>finally, you'll have to login to create a repl and save your work</li>
</ul>
<p>We remain committed to openness and instantness -- two principles that have made Repl.it special. I am thrilled to see you on the inside!</p>
<hr>
<p><small>1: it's worth noting that we're already big Google Cloud customers, and our spend only continues to grow with them. </small></p>

November 5, 2020 | https://jon.io/this-product-doesnt-exist-building-products-super-fast | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jon.io/this-product-doesnt-exist-building-products-super-fast">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Last year I was obsessed with Generative Art - that's art that is generated using only algorithms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the image below, I forced an algorithm to draw me (yes, that's me) having learnt only about triangles. If you want to see more impressive art you should check out <a href="https://tylerxhobbs.com/">Tyler Hobbs</a> and this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/generative/">sub-Reddit</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="My Generative Art" src="https://jon.io/images/genart.gif"></p>
<p>But how do we perceive shapes and ideas when we are forced to limit ourselves? Can we extract the basics of a product by eliminating the unnecessary?</p>
<h2>This bicycle does not&nbsp;exist</h2>
<p>If you go to <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/">ThisPersonDoesNotExist</a> and you keep refreshing the page, you will see every time a photo of person that doesn't exist. That photo has been generated by a Machine Learning algorithm that mashes millions of photos together and comes up with a new face every time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A friend of mine introduced me to <a href="https://www.gianlucagimini.it/portfolio-item/velocipedia/?fbclid=IwAR3mtHozjRDKoawWPS6PcYeltg4jvZucLnvuj4RrGkWWeRlVr0fhk5cvZv8">Velocipedia</a>, a project where people are asked to draw bicycles from memory.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="Bicycle" src="https://jon.io/images/artbike.png"></p>
<p>The majority of the bicycles drawn have some vital flows. <strong>These bicycles cannot exist</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Gianluca Gimini says:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Little I knew this is actually a test that psychologists use to demonstrate how our brain sometimes tricks us into thinking we know something even though we don't.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How about we do this for building products?</p>
<h2>This Product Does Not&nbsp;Exist</h2>
<p>For the last couple of months I am building a new platform that teaches you how to build a Startup <strong>fast</strong> and the number one problem is overthinking about your first version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And of course the majority of founders are building their prototype without ever talking to at least 10 customers. Crazy right?</p>
<p>I am (obviously) guilty of overthinking too when it comes to product development so I decided to ask 20 users to draw, using only pen and paper, the landing page and one functional page. This could work with just 5 users by the way. This is the message that I've sent them</p>
<p><img alt="Sent by me" src="https://jon.io/images/sentbyme.png"></p>
<p>You can try it yourself if you want before seeing the results.</p>
<h2>What I've learnt from the landing&nbsp;pages</h2>
<p><strong>1/ What <em>I</em> like is not what my users like</strong>
<img alt="Landing" src="https://jon.io/images/proone.png"></p>
<p>90% of the landing pages had a video/teaser which is something <strong>my design didn't have</strong>. I don't like having videos in landing pages but it seems that for educational content, it is a must.</p>
<p><img alt="Landing" src="https://jon.io/images/protwo.png"></p>
<p><strong>2/ Users expect discounts</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Landing" src="https://jon.io/images/prothree.png"></p>
<p>Most of the designs had a "free week" or "buy now and get X% discount". <strong>I have this too</strong> (you get most of the chapters for free) but not in that prominent space.</p>
<p><strong>3/ Testimonials were not such a big theme</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Landing" src="https://jon.io/images/profour.png"></p>
<p>Every landing page that had testimonials didn't dedicate a lot of space to them and it was usually on the second page (under the fold). <strong>That was my wrong assumption</strong>, thinking that I needed to have a good amount of testimonials.</p>
<p><strong>4/ Pay attention to interesting ideas</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Landing" src="https://jon.io/images/profive.png"></p>
<p>There were some landing pages that were 100% different from the rest. I am definitely going to integrate some ideas from them. It what makes products different, interesting and fun to use.</p>
<h2>What I've learnt from the functional pages</h2>
<p><strong>5/ Video is king - but text is his Queen</strong></p>
<p>Notes, action lists, descriptions and extra resources. <strong>I HAD NO IDEA</strong>.
&nbsp;
Now it makes sense. Users want more material and want to be able to go back and look at their notes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="Landing" src="https://jon.io/images/prosix.png"></p>
<p><strong>6/ Group chat and discussions</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Landing" src="https://jon.io/images/proseven.png"></p>
<p>This is a much more difficult feature but it seemed important for a lot of users. I would try using Slack/Discord before building something into the product.</p>
<h2>The Perfect User Does Not&nbsp;Exist</h2>
<p>I could have built the landing user-generated landing page waaaaaay faster than the one I designed. Making assumptions and believing in them is the worst way to build a Startup.</p>
<p>If you want to learn how your users can use your product, eliminate all your biases. Give them a pen and paper and tell them to draw the UI. Focus on the commonality, build fast and have them try it out again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, you cannot make everyone happy. The Perfect User Does Not Exist.</p>
<h2>A huge&nbsp;thanks</h2>
<p>Goes to everyone who sent me their drawings! You get free access to the course <strong>forever</strong> :)</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the course, don't forget to sign up to the <a href="https://jon.io/pages/weekly-tips">mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>Now go and make some products that don't exist.</p>
<p>Coming Next: Selling a course to change the world</p>
