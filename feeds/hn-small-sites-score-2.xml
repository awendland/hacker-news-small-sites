<p>Have you ever wondered which pages people look at once they have landed on your site? How do they navigate? The same questions go for designing a new digital product. How do people click through your prototype? How do they navigate and interact with the designed solution? </p>



<p>If you are conducting a UX study, you can turn to <strong>Useberry </strong>for answers!</p>



<p>In this post, I want to show you a very cool feature called <strong>User Flow.</strong></p>



<p>With Useberry’s <strong>User Flow</strong> report you can learn about the path a visitor takes before reaching its destination while you are in the prototype phase of the design.</p>



<p>But, first things first.<br></p>



<h3>What is User Flow?</h3>



<p>User Flow visualizes the path a user follows from one screen to the next. It helps you understand the behavior of your users, how they interact with your prototype, and create a conversion funnel for it.</p>



<p>In other words, it is a graphical representation of which screens users utilize to complete a specific task, how they move around your prototype, and, most importantly, which screens they’re on when they decide to leave.</p>



<p>Let’s say a user lands on the “Home” screen, goes to the “About” screen, and then to “Contact Us” before leaving.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>The user path would then be <strong>Home -&gt; About -&gt; Contact Us.</strong></p></div>



<h3>Why is this important?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The User Flow report can indicate specific points where testers remained longer or got stuck perhaps and help you make changes to enhance the user experience. The easier testers can navigate through your prototype and complete your task, the happier visitors to your final product they’ll become.</p>



<p>Gaining a deeper understanding of how testers are interacting with your prototype can help you optimize your screens for maximum conversions.</p>



<p>This means that you’ll be able to see if there are any specific screens that made users leave your test/prototype. Once these screens have been recognized and then altered with more appropriate or engaging content, you can go back to the User Flow report to check if the number of drop-offs has declined.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>You know what you want and like, but to be effective in the UX industry you need to understand the desires of your prospective users.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Understanding the preferences of your target audience is the first step in optimizing your design for conversions. Your aim is to make it easy for your target audience to find and purchase your products and services.<br></p>



<p>Here are just a few of the user behaviors you can learn about with the User Flow report:</p>



<ul><li>Which paths do your testers favor?&nbsp;</li><li>Which screens have the highest drop-off rate?</li></ul>







<h2>What do they look like?</h2>



<p>If you are familiar with the Google Analytics User Flows then you have an idea of how complex (or simple) a User Flow might look.</p>

<h2>How to use User Flow Report in Useberry</h2>



<p>Now that you know what User Flow is and why it’s important, let’s see how you can find and use the report in Useberry and in your designs.</p>



<p>The best way to explain something is with an <strong>example</strong>.</p>



<p>So, let’s create a simple prototype of a music app and monitor how our potential users interact with/navigate through it in order to complete a simple task.</p>



<p>In the following example, we have a “simple” scenario.</p>



<p>We asked 10 testers to “<strong>Add a track to their wish list</strong>”.</p>



<p>The path that the users “should” take and where they “should” click in order to complete the task appears in the screenshot.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path-1024x267.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path-1024x267.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path-300x78.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path-768x200.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Expected path users must follow to complete the task</figcaption></figure>



<p>The whole prototype that we are using appears in the following screenshot:</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow-1024x573.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow-1024x573.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow-300x168.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow-768x430.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>For the purposes of this example, we created the prototype with <strong>Figma</strong> for which we used the <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Useberry plugin (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/788799088384104964/Useberry" target="_blank">Useberry plugin</a></strong>.<br></p>



<p><strong>Let’s start our test:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Task</strong>: Add a track to your favorites list&nbsp;<br><strong>Instructions</strong>: Navigate through the prototype and add a track to your wish list.<br><strong>Type of test:</strong> Single task<br><strong>Number of blocks used in Useberry</strong>: 2 (Single Task, Thank you)<br><strong>Audience</strong>: People from a Facebook group of music fans<br><strong>Number of testers</strong>: 10<br><strong>Time to get back results:</strong> 4 minutes<br><strong>Link to the test</strong>: <a href="https://app.useberry.com/preview/XT84tChQ/">https://app.useberry.com/preview/XT84tChQ/</a><br></p>



<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results.png 865w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results-300x162.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results-768x415.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px"></a></figure></div>



<p>OK, we have 60% success in the single task which means that 4 of our users couldn’t complete the task successfully.</p>



<p><strong>But WHY is this the case? </strong></p>



<p><strong>It was so obvious what they had to do, you might think.<br></strong></p>



<p>Let’s focus on the single task now and look at the results:<br></p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/single-task-results.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/single-task-results.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/single-task-results.png 872w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/single-task-results-300x243.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/single-task-results-768x623.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 872px) 100vw, 872px"></a></figure>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stats.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stats.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stats.png 891w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stats-300x106.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stats-768x272.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 891px) 100vw, 891px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Ok, we can see that 4 users skipped the task.<br></p>



<p>Now, we have 2 options:</p>



<ul><li>Filter the results and watch the session recording of the specific users</li><li>View the user flow and find the pain area </li></ul>



<p>With 10 testers it’s easy to monitor the session recording of 4 users but <strong>on a larger scale</strong> – what would happen if we had more than 100 users?</p>



<p>So, let’s examine the User Flow in order to better understand what happened.</p>



<p>And the results are…</p>



<p>Lines and Curves.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1024x309.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1024x309.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-300x91.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-768x232.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Useberry’s User Flow of the test</figcaption></figure>



<p>This looks a bit complex (or not!) but let’s analyze it anyhow.</p>



<p>Let’s <strong>zoom in</strong> a little bit and explain what we can see here.</p>



<figure><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM-1024x713.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM-1024x713.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM-300x209.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM-768x535.png 768w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM.png 1106w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Think of the User Flow as a table.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every <strong>cell</strong> is an <strong>incremental navigation</strong> <strong>step</strong> and every <strong>row</strong> is a <strong>screen that appeared</strong> on the specific navigation step.</p>



<p>We then <strong>group unique screens with unique navigation steps</strong> and we create the User Flow.</p>



<p>Next to every screen, you will notice a number, and some screens may have a colored number below them. </p>



<p>The number next to the screen is the number of unique users who landed on the specific screen and the number below the screen is an event. </p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/event-explanation.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/event-explanation.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/event-explanation.png 662w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/event-explanation-300x235.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Here at Useberry, we capture 3 different events:</p>



<p><strong>Yellow event (Skip):</strong> Number of users who skipped the task on the specific step.<br><strong>Blue event (Success):</strong> Number of users who completed the task on the specific step.<br><strong>Red event (Drop-off):</strong> Number of users who dropped-off (totally closed) the test on the specific step.</p>







<p>Now, let’s go back to our example and the results that we have obtained.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1-1024x309.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1-1024x309.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1-300x91.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1-768x232.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Click the image to enlarge</figcaption></figure>



<p>In our User Flow example, we can see that we have <strong>multiple paths</strong> that users followed to complete their task.</p>



<p>(In this specific example, we don’t have users that closed the test before it ended which is why we don’t have red events.)</p>



<p>If we look carefully at the User Flow, we realize that we have 4 different screens that have events under them, which means that we have 4 different flows.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths-1024x309.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths-1024x309.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths-300x91.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths-768x232.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>click image to enlarge</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Optimal Path</strong></p>



<p>Clicking the”Optimal path” button we can see the most common flow that users took in order to complete their task.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal-1024x495.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal-1024x495.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal-300x145.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal-768x371.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Optimal path</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Oh, wait…</strong></p>



<p>Those are the users that skipped the task!</p>



<blockquote><p>The “top path” is the most common user flow. It’s the series of screens seen by your typical tester. Every app has one. But not every designer knows what it is.</p></blockquote>



<p>Namely,  4 users took the <strong>exact specific path</strong> and these users skipped the task after they landed on a specific screen.</p>



<p>Bearing in mind the expected path and seeing that the optimal path is not the same as the expected path, we can <strong>quickly</strong> figure out that we need to modify our design in order to increase the success of the test.</p>



<p><strong>Let’s go a little deeper, though</strong>.</p>



<p>If we look carefully at the screen where testers split, we can see that that’s where we need to focus.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/spllited-titles.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/spllited-titles.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/spllited-titles.png 668w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/spllited-titles-274x300.png 274w" sizes="(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px"></a><figcaption>Click on the image to enlarge</figcaption></figure>



<p>We have 8 users who landed on <strong>screen A</strong> and 2 users who landed on <strong>screen B</strong>. On our expected path, the <strong>screen B</strong> is the “expected” screen. The users <strong>MUST</strong> go there in order to complete the task. </p>



<p>So, we have two options – change our design in order to lead these 8 users to <strong>screen B</strong> or design “something” on <strong>screen A</strong> to satisfy our users.</p>



<p>Now let’s see where the users clicked and <strong>why they split</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>How?</strong> </p>



<p>Just click “View Heatmaps” on the specific screen.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/splitted-heatmaps-2.png" alt="" width="603" height="680" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/splitted-heatmaps-2.png 603w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/splitted-heatmaps-2-266x300.png 266w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px"><figcaption><br>By clicking heatmaps on a screen you will see where the users clicked when they were on the specific screen and the specific path step</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>And the results are…</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heatmap-1.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heatmap-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heatmap-1.png 400w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heatmap-1-156x300.png 156w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></a></figure></div>



<p><strong>Aha… Interesting! </strong></p>



<p>It seems that our testers and our potential users, in order to add a track to their wish list, first navigate through the specific track. (makes sense!)</p>



<p>Well, a possible solution to this is to satisfy our users when they land on <strong>screen B</strong>. That’s why we changed the design and added a bar with the “add to wishlist” button on the specific screen and run a new test again.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution-1024x851.png" alt="" width="580" height="482" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution-1024x851.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution-300x249.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution-768x638.png 768w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution.png 1063w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"></a><figcaption>Before – After</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Task</strong>: Add a track to your favorite list&nbsp;<br><strong>Instructions</strong>: Navigate through the prototype and add a track to your wish list.<br><strong>Type of test:</strong> Single task<br><strong>Number of blocks used in useberry</strong>: 2 (Single Task, Thank you)<br><strong>Audience</strong>: From a Facebook group of music fans<br><strong>Number of testers</strong>: 10<br><strong>Time to get back results:</strong> 4 minutes<br><strong>Link to the test</strong>: <a href="https://app.useberry.com/preview/hbtk48wW/">https://app.useberry.com/preview/hbtk48wW/</a></p>



<p>And the results of the <strong>new </strong>test are…</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results.png 866w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results-300x249.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results-768x637.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 866px) 100vw, 866px"></a></figure></div>

<p><strong>Amazing!</strong> We actually increased our conversions!</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>We managed to find an issue in something we thought was obvious and we resolved it quickly with the help of the user-flows. </p>



<p>Running tests in the design phase helps you save time and effort and solve UX issues that never even occurred to you before.</p>



<p>Maybe the results of the test are obvious but this is just a demo and an example in order to explain what user-flow looks like and how it can help you resolve UX issues.</p>



<p>With more complex prototypes and more testers, the user-flow becomes more complex, too, but we are trying to add features to make it as friendly as we possibly can – it’s up to you if you want to dig into it.</p>



<p>So, happy designing and feel free to come forward with any suggestions!</p>

    <div><div><p>The intensification of dairy farming has been a concern of ours for many years, so we’ve been working hard to come up with a different solution. Our big idea? A new method of dairy farming that keeps the calves with their mothers to suckle. Our <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/ethical-dairy-system">ethical dairy model</a> is based around treating the animals, the land, our environment and the people who work here with respect and kindness.</p></div></div>
<div>
  <div><div><div><div about="" typeof="">
  <div>
    <div><div><div><p>In traditional dairy farms calves are removed from their mothers within a few hours of their birth - the stress this places on the cow is clear. So we wanted to find a way to keep calves with the cows and still have a financially viable farm. Put simply, we don’t want to have to choose between doing what’s right and staying in business.</p>
<p>As an organic dairy farm for more than twenty years our cows have already benefitted from some of the highest welfare standards in the UK, but we knew we could do even better. We built a new dairy, specially designed to house calves with their mothers, and we trialled the full cow with calf system for the first time in 2012. It taught us a lot, but financially cost us an awful lot.</p>
<p><span>However, the impact it made on cow contentment was staggering. All the animals were noticeably calmer and far more confident. <span>&nbsp;</span>After two to three months the calves became like teenagers, they loved playing with their pals and really only came back to mum when they wanted food!</span></p>
<p><span></span>We are determined to make our radical new model of dairy farming work, and by purchasing cheese from The Ethical Dairy you are helping to support it.</p>

  <div>
    <div><div><div><p>Since October 2016 our calves have stayed with their mothers for 5 to 6 months. We still milk them in that period, but only once a day.</p>
<p>We are still at the early stages of The Ethical Dairy project, but our new approach to dairy farming has already led to huge reductions in the use of <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/power-nature">antibiotics</a>, increases in <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/biodiversity-ethical-dairy">biodiversity</a> and <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/healthier-winter">healthier</a>, happier cows. Compared to an average dairy farm, already The Ethical Dairy has:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than half</li>
<li>Reduced <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/coo-poo-power">energy</a> use by more than half</li>
<li>Cut <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/power-nature">antibiotic</a> use by 90%</li>
<li>Cut agro-chemical use by 90%</li>
<li>Doubled the productive life of cows</li>
<li>Increased our farm <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/biodiversity-ethical-dairy">biodiversity</a> five-fold</li>
<li>Increased the net amount of food in our <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/politics-food-production">food system</a> by 80%</li>
<li>Exceeded the highest standards of animal welfare</li>
</ul>
<p>The Ethical Dairy has been supported in its journey by many individuals through our crowdfunding campaign in the autumn of 2018, and by public funding, such as Dumfries and Galloway LEADER which is helping us to attend trade shows, events, and to market and promote our products. We are also grateful for support from the Food Processing, Manufacturing and Cooperation grant which has supported the development of our new cheese dairy.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><a href="https://console.dev/">Console</a> is starting as a free weekly newsletter highlighting the best tools for developers. We want to know how our list is performing, which means keeping an eye on some key metrics like active subscribers and unsubscribe rates. We can log into Mailchimp to see this data, but I wanted to get a quick daily update rather than forming a habit of constantly logging in.</p><p>We <a href="https://basecamp.com/guides/group-chat-problems">default to asynchronous communication</a> and use the chat room built into <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> for informal socialising or posting non-critical links and comments. I check it each morning, so it seemed like a good place to post a status update.</p><p>Like most chat products <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/bc3-api/blob/master/sections/chatbots.md#create-a-line">Basecamp has a bot API</a> to send arbitrary messages into the chat. It is therefore easy to use <a href="https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/docs/fundamentals/">the Mailchimp API</a> to <a href="https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/api/lists/get-list-info/">pull the stats</a> and post them into Basecamp. This code just needs to run every morning.</p><p>Keeping <a href="https://blog.console.dev/console-tech-stack-2021/">our tech stack</a> as simple as possible is a priority. We don't have a complex product and dealing with servers, OS updates, database replication, etc is something we will put off as long as possible! However, a chat bot has to run somewhere. This is the perfect use-case for a serverless function - just write the code and let the platform deal with the infrastructure maintenance.</p><h2 id="azure-vs-google-vs-aws">Azure vs Google vs AWS</h2><p>I have <a href="https://davidmytton.blog/who-has-the-best-serverless-platform/">tried AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions</a>, and have several personal utility functions running on both Google and Azure. Whilst I have been impressed with Google Cloud's database products, they are still behind when it comes to the breadth of functionality in their serverless functions product. Google doesn't support Rust and has no concept of custom runtimes like AWS and Azure do.</p><p>This meant it was down to AWS vs Azure. Both have excellent documentation, lots of language SDKs, and a large ecosystem of developers. However, I prefer the Azure web portal, like how they build in public on GitHub, and <a href="https://davidmytton.blog/fighting-over-who-has-the-greenest-public-cloud/">rate them best for environmental sustainability</a>. AWS is the more popular platform and Lambda/Azure Functions are competitive. I just prefer Azure.</p><h2 id="creating-a-python-serverless-bot">Creating a Python serverless bot</h2><p>I have been writing Python for over 10 years, so it was the default choice to create a simple serverless bot. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-python">Azure has native Python support</a>, the Basecamp API takes a simple HTTP POST, and <a href="https://github.com/mailchimp/mailchimp-marketing-python">Mailchimp has an official Python SDK</a>. </p><p>This meant that within a few hours I had written a function, created the Azure Resource Manager template, and configured GitHub Actions to automatically deploy on push. The bot was running and delivering us stats each morning.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/campfire-totorobot-python.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/campfire-totorobot-python.png 600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/campfire-totorobot-python.png 825w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Python bot posting our daily Mailchimp stats into Basecamp.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="why-port-to-rust">Why port to Rust?</h2><p>Over Christmas I usually leave London to visit my family, however <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-55380644">the change in COVID-19 rules</a> meant that I could no longer leave the city. With some extra time, particularly in the quiet period between Christmas and New Year, I ended up spending several days playing around with <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.</p><p>Although it has been around since 2010, Rust has become particularly popular in the last few years. <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted">Stack Overflow have listed it as the most loved language</a> since 2016.</p><p>I won't go into the standard Rust pitch of "better safety, concurrency, performance" - you can find detailed Rust <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03382-2">vs</a> Language X <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2015/5/27/rust-for-pythonistas/">posts</a> <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/rust-vs-go">elsewhere</a> - but I did want to write up my experience as a Rust newbie.</p><h3 id="reason-1-fun-and-interesting">Reason 1: Fun and interesting</h3><p>My main reason for porting from Python to Rust was that it was fun and interesting! I like Python (which sits at #3 in the "most loved" 2020 ranking) because it is easy to start writing code and you can get things done quickly. It also enforces a particular coding style which means more consistent layout, spacing, indenting, etc.</p><p>Python doesn't make you think about concepts like static typing and memory management because it handles it for you. Rust is very different. It forces you to consider types, ensure all return cases are handled consistently, understand scoping, and many other things which are absent in Python. This is by design because it makes the resulting code much more robust.</p><p>Rust uses the concept of "<a href="https://sled.rs/errors">correctness</a>". It's not that Rust is "right" and Python is "wrong", but forcing you think about these concepts, and enforcing them before code will compile, helps to avoid errors:</p><blockquote>almost all (92%) of the catastrophic system failures are the result of incorrect handling of non-fatal errors explicitly signaled in software.<p>- <a href="http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~yuan/papers/failure_analysis_osdi14.pdf">Simple Testing Can Prevent Most Critical Failures: An Analysis of Production Failures in Distributed Data-intensive Systems</a></p></blockquote><p>The number of times I have found bugs in my Python code due to silly mistakes like typos or not handling a particular error case makes me appreciate Rust's approach. Better to invest more time in development rather than finding bugs and errors once code has been shipped to production. </p><p>I still need to write more extensive unit tests and mock the external API calls but tests are a core language feature. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html">Developers are encourged</a> to write tests inside the source that is being tested, with integration tests in a "tests" directory.</p><h3 id="reason-2-portability">Reason 2: Portability</h3><p>Neither AWS Lambda nor Azure Functions have native support for Rust, but they both support Custom <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html">Runtimes</a>/<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-other">Handlers</a>. This allows you to build a generic web endpoint which, if it can handle to standard HTTP requests and return a standard HTTP response, can be executed by the platform.</p><p>(This is true for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-custom-handlers#http-only-function">an HTTP triggered function on Azure</a>. Getting into more platform-specific function types, like a Timer or Queue trigger, means relying more on the platform features. This makes it more difficult to port away, but not impossible).</p><p>All languages have a range of frameworks that help building web endpoints, often with an embedded web server. Rust has <a href="https://actix.rs/">Actix</a> and <a href="https://rocket.rs/">Rocket</a>, <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-07-04-choosing-a-rust-web-framework-2020-edition/">amongst others</a>. By creating generic HTTP endpoints, the application can be run anywhere. AWS Lambda has <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime">some experimental Rust language bindings</a>, but creating a set of generic web endpoints is better because it is not then tied to a specific platform.</p><p>This is not unique to Rust. Python has <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a> (or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, for a more "batteries included" approach). However, Rust differs because it is a statically compiled language. This means the output is a binary that runs entirely independently, only requiring the system libc implementation. If you <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/platform-and-target-support/musl-support-for-fully-static-binaries.html">compile it with a musl target</a> it becomes 100% static and will therefore run on any Linux OS. </p><p>Statically compiled binaries have all their dependencies included executable. This means the binary should continue to run "forever", even if the platform changes. Indeed, because the application is completely isolated and separate from the platform, there is no reliance on specific system-installed packages. Both can be updated independent of each other. This can be partly achieved using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html">Python Virtual Environments</a>, but they are complex and have developer overhead (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/">PEP-0582</a> aims to fix that). Static compilation is a more robust approach.</p><p>It is currently convenient to run this bot on Azure, but it would be trivial to move it to AWS or a generic web server. Using <a href="https://upx.github.io/">upx</a> to <a href="https://github.com/svenstaro/upx-action">compress the executable</a> means the final binary with a full embedded web server is just 2.5MB. This application is so lightweight it could even run on a Raspberry Pi in the office - I'd just need to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">compile it for ARM</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/compressed-binary.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/compressed-binary.png 600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/compressed-binary.png 670w"><figcaption>The final 100% static, upx compressed binary. Only 2.5MB.</figcaption></figure><p>This is definitely overkill for a chatbot project. There is no tangible benefit to statically compiling a few hundred lines of Rust vs deploying the same length Python code to Azure Functions. There are only a couple of dependencies! </p><p>But this is a great test project to learn how it works (see Reason #1 above). Internal tools tend to be built quickly and with less polish than software you intend to ship to customers. Yet they often last the longest in production because of how widely used they become. In some organizations it can be hard to justify spending expensive developer time on such projects, so investing in maintainabilty upfront is worth it.</p><h3 id="reason-3-developer-tooling">Reason 3: Developer tooling</h3><p>The overall experience of writing Rust is made much more enjoyable because of the developer tooling. Everything revolves around <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html">Cargo</a> which makes documentation, dependency management, linting, testing, and builds all part of the core language. Installing Rust using the standard rustup command also includes Cargo and there are several useful extras like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">Clippy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/RustSec/cargo-audit">Audit</a>.</p><p>This is a big win for developers because everything you need is available out of the box. Third-party packages can be found in the <a href="https://crates.io/">Crate registry</a>. The equivalent in Python, <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a> and <a href="https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#pip">pip</a>, does not feel as slick and wasn't even included with Python when I first started coding it (when setuptools/easy_install were the primary method of package management). You also have to be careful to use a Python virtual environment if you have a system managed installation of Python, otherwise you will end up installing system-level dependencies.</p><p>I'm a vim user so the official <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.vim">rust.vim plugin</a> gives me autocomplete and in-editor checks, but the output from Cargo (warnings and errors) is very helpful and pinpointing problems. <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">rust-clippy</a> is fun, too.</p><p>Where Python has an advantage is the number of libraries. PyPI has over 280,000 packages whereas Cargo has 53,000. Quantity is not an indication of quality, and Python has been stable longer, but it is reasonable to expect vendors to provide official Python SDKs. That is less common with Rust.</p><h2 id="challenges-learning-rust">Challenges learning Rust</h2><p>I wrote the Python bot in a few hours but it took me several days to get the Rust port working. This would be hard to justify if it wasn't a learning project, but everyone gets faster with experience. I had to learn not just a new language but also how to properly cross-compile for a different platform.

			<p>GameStop Corp (GME) continues to rally today and is now up over +370% in 2021. GME shorts and longs are in a knockout battle being waged in the stock market as well asocial media platforms. Both sides are holding their ground with strong conviction, but in the end, one side will be the outright winner, and in the later rounds of this prize fight the long shareholders are way ahead on points.</p>
<p>GME short interest is $5.51 billion; 71.79 million shares shorted; 139.57% SI % Float; 58.26% S3 SI % Float; 31% stock borrow fee on existing shorts and new shorts are paying over 80% fee.</p>
<p>GME has now climbed to #12 in the short interest league table:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-9.png" alt="" width="641" height="465" srcset="https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-9.png 641w, https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-9-585x424.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px"></p>
<p>A year ago, GME short interest was $276 million; 63.98 million shares shorted (stock price was $4.32); 104.01% SI % Float; 50.98% S3 SI % Float. While shares shorted only increased by +12%, total dollars as risk have risen by +1,900%. A scarcity in stock borrow availability has limited the increase in shares shorted, but even as mark-to market losses we are not seeing a decrease in overall shares shorted. In fact, GME has the highest level of SI % Float for any equity worldwide (with short interest over $100 million).</p>
<p>GME is #1 in highest Short Interest % of Float:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-10.png" alt="" width="640" height="254" srcset="https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-10.png 640w, https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-10-585x232.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></p>
<p>GME’s SI % of float is over 100%, which is illogical as you cannot get five quarts of milk out of a gallon jug. In actuality, GME’s short interest is 58.26% if we include the “synthetic longs” that are created by short sales in the float calculation. A portion of these “synthetic longs” become lendable shares as they settle in&nbsp; lending programs (mutual funds and ETF providers), marginable retail accounts and rehypothicatable hedge fund accounts. Short selling therefore not only provides added daily trading liquidity but also stock loan liquidity which supports not only the ability to execute Alpha generating short trades but also liquidity for portfolio hedging strategies and derivative (option\swap) hedging.</p>
<p>Over the last 30 days we saw shares shorted increase by +1.53 million shares, worth $117 million, an increase of +2.18% as its stock price rose +281%. Over the last 7 days we saw shares shorted increase by +900 thousand shares, worth $69 million, an increase of +1.27% as its stock price rose +116%.</p>
<p>We are still seeing a short squeeze on existing older shorts, with these more value-based short sellers trimming or closing their positions due to large mark-to-market losses. But, for every short position that is closed, and stock borrow returned we are seeing extremely strong demand from new short sellers looking to initiate new short positions and capitalize on an Icarus like fall for a stock price that has soared too high. Brokers and Prime Brokers are looking into every nook and cranny to satisfy short selling demand.</p>
<p>Shorting GME has not been a profitable trade for short sellers. Shorts were down -$968 million in net-of-financing mark-to-market losses in 2020 and are already down -$5.05 billion in 2021, which includes a loss of -$876 million on today’s +16% intraday move (stock price $89.00).</p>
<p>At the moment, the prize fight is between momentum longs and momentum shorts, with the longs way ahead on points but shorts are looking for a knock-out in the later rounds. While long buyers are continuing to throw punches by continuing to bid up stock prices, short sellers do not have many haymakers left to throw as stock borrow supply curtails new short selling activity in size.</p>

<p>If GME’s stock price remains at these levels or continues to rise, both value and momentum shorts will be squeezed out of their positions and GME’s stock price will get the added boost of short buy-to-covers standing shoulder to shoulder with long buyers in driving up GME’s stock price. But if GME’s stock price faulters, shorts will hold on to their positions and scramble for any slivers of stock loan borrows they can garner as long buyers begin exiting their positions in order to lock in their recent outsized mark-to-market profits. If long shareholders do begin selling, there may be an avalanche of long sellers hitting the tape since no-one wants to see their mark-to-market profits melt away and be the last ones holding the bag. Either way, this is a heavy weight fight worth watching.</p>

    <p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/hermetic_world.jpg" alt="The world description from an hermetic point of view was always convoluted and full of retrospective to enforce meaning" loading="lazy"></p>

<p><em>The year of the Linux desktop is coming</em>, and it looks like a piñata of
micro-services. Let’s break it and see the candies inside.</p>

<ul>
  <li>systemd core — the building block framework abstracting basic functionalities</li>
  <li>A universal package manager with a single reposotiry where anyone can push</li>
  <li>flatpak/appimage/snap — containarized applications</li>
  <li>polkit and apparmor — granular security</li>
  <li>systemd-homed — movable home with an immutable base system</li>
  <li>wayland compositors — the graphical environment</li>
  <li>pipewire — media pipeline</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re bored you can leave now, that’s it. Otherwise, let me get more
ideas out, but nothing surprising to anyone that has been following RedHat,
the freedesktop.org, and systemd.</p>

<p>The key innovation of the picture I lay above is that every
layer in the system is now isolated and communicate with one
another through d-bus services. D-bus is <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2020/07/06/dbus-polkit.html">fantastic in its own
right</a> and good at
abstracting functionalities.</p>

<p>All of these pieces need one another. Wayland compositors need pipewire
to be able to access media hardware, and pipewire needs polkit (or
similar mechanism) to select who can do that. Similarly, containarized
applications access the rest of the system through systemd services,
polkit, and pipewire.</p>

<p>What this leads to is a base system that is stable, a solid framework
to build on. The home is transportable inside a systemd-homed, along
with the containarized apps, proprietary or not.</p>

<p>The deep secret insider info I got tells me that this is a giant scheme
to get us all in a vendor lock-in. I can lie, this is the internet.<br>
Or better (or worse?), this is a new Android ecosystem.</p>

<p>Who’s going to nag when this is all done in the open; when the open
source movers are the implementers of the de-facto implementations;
when they keep piling the standards until nobody can follow them.</p>

<p>I believe the direction the Linux desktop is going towards will
bring more incentives for investments. Distributions uniqueness
won’t matter anymore as they’ll be centralized around a “store”
where devs will push directly. (<a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2020/03/29/distro-pkgs.html">see previous post about distros
roles</a>)</p>

<p>Leave a comment if you weren’t aware of this vision of how distros will
look in the future.</p>

  2021-01-27
</p>
<p>This is an update of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/28.html">the popular 2018 FAQ</a>.  Details
have changed, but the spirit of the project is the same.  If you've already
read this, see <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html">yesterday's post</a> for more color.</p>
<p>Whenever I announce a new <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=oil-release#oil-release">Oil release</a>, some readers are confused
by the project.</p>
<p>This post explains the project's motivation from several perspectives.  Because
Unix shell is an old and successful technology, there are many ways of looking
at it.</p>
 
<a name="introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Before explaining <em>why</em> I created Oil, let's review <em>what</em> it is.  You can
think of a Unix shell in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>As a text-based <strong>user interface</strong>.  You communicate with the operating
system by typing commands.</li>
<li>As a <strong>language</strong>.  It has variables, functions, and loops.  Shell programs
are text files that start with <code>#!/bin/sh</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this document, we'll think of Unix shells as languages.  The Oil project
actually has <strong>two languages</strong>: OSH and Oil.  Let's define these terms, along with
two others for context:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-shell-spec#posix-shell-spec">POSIX shell</a> is a language defined by a standards body.
For example, Debian Linux and FreeBSD are both Unix operating systems that
provide POSIX shells.  Nearly all shells are POSIX-compatible: <code>bash</code>,
<code>dash</code>, <code>ksh</code>, etc.</li>
<li>GNU <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> is the most popular shell implementation in the world.
It was first released in 1989, and implements the POSIX standard plus many
extensions.  It's the default shell on most Linux distributions, runs on BSD
Unix variants, <a href="https://scriptingosx.com/2019/06/moving-to-zsh/">used to ship on Mac OS X</a>, and <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/">runs on
Windows</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH</a> is a shell implementation that's part of the Oil project.
It's compatible with both POSIX and <code>bash</code>.  The goal is to run <strong>existing
shell scripts</strong>.  It's done so <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/15.html">since January 2018</a>, and has matured
in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/releases.html">many regular releases</a> since then.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">Oil language</a> is a brand new, incompatible, shell
language.  The idea is to fix more than four decades of accumulated warts in
the Unix shell.  Many Unix users are angry that shell is so difficult, and
Oil aims to fix that.  (Example: Why is <code>x=1</code> different than <code>x = 1</code>?)</li>
</ul>
<p>More about the Oil language:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compared to POSIX shell and bash, Oil is <strong>easier to learn, write, and
debug</strong>.  It's designed for programmers who know Python, JavaScript, or Ruby,
but avoid shell.</li>
<li>Oil will do everything bash can, <strong>and more</strong>.  For example, it will have
dynamic types and structured data, not just strings.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/01/simplest-explanation.html">The Simplest Explanation of Oil</a>
shows examples of the language.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/idioms.html">Oil Language Idioms</a> compares
old shell code and new Oil code.  Importantly, the same interpreter runs both
styles.  It's useful to think of OSH and Oil separately, but there's a
<strong>gradual transition</strong> between the two.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best description of the project is on <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/">the home page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oil is our upgrade path from <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> to a better language and runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<a name="frequently-asked-questions"></a>
<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>This section paraphrases questions I've received and summarizes the answers.
In most cases, I link to the original comment thread, which you can read for
details.</p>
<a name="how-is-oil-different-than-bash-or-zsh"></a>
<h3>How is Oil different than <code>bash</code> or <code>zsh</code>?</h3>
<p>Oil is taking shell seriously as a <strong>programming language</strong>, rather than
treating it as a text-based UI that can be abused to write programs.</p>
<p>To see why this is valuable, consider these two groups of shell users:</p>
<ol>
<li>People who use shell to type a few commands here and there.</li>
<li>People who write scripts, which may get into the hundreds or even thousands
of lines.</li>
</ol>
<p>Oil is aimed at group 2.  If you're in group 1, there's admittedly <strong>no
reason</strong> to use it right now.</p>
<p>However, group 2 writes scripts for group 1 to use!  So I believe the benefits
of Oil will eventually bubble up.</p>
<p>In other words, I'm building a <strong>solid foundation</strong> for a few more decades of
shell usage.</p>

</ul>
<a name="i-dont-understand-why-not-use-a-different-a-programming-language"></a>
<h3>I don't understand.  Why not use a different a programming language?</h3>
<p>It's important to be compatible with existing code.  You might not personally
use shell as a programming language, but all Unix users still rely on big shell
programs.  It's often used at build time, but it's still used at runtime too,
e.g. on embedded Linux devices.</p>
<p>Some of this code is old, but much of it is <strong>new</strong>.  It's not a small amount
of code, either.  Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, a popular cluster manager from Google (released around 2014),
has <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.3.0/test/wild.wwz/cloud/kubernetes/index.html">48,000+ lines</a> of shell in its repo.</li>
<li>Many distros use the <a href="https://github.com/scop/bash-completion">bash-completion</a> project for interactive completions,
and it has <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.3.0/test/wild.wwz/shell/bash-completion/index.html">26,000 lines</a> of shell.</li>
<li>More examples: <a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/The-Biggest-Shell-Programs-in-the-World">The Biggest Shell Programs in the
World</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/7lsajn/oil_shell_03_release/drom6q4/">Original question and answer</a> (reddit.com)</p>
<a name="shouldnt-we-discourage-people-from-writing-shell-scripts"></a>
<h3>Shouldn't we discourage people from writing shell scripts?</h3>
<p>There are three problems with that:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It won't work</strong>.  It would be like trying to convince people who are paid
to write PHP not to write PHP.  Many people have wasted breath on that, but
important sites like Wikipedia are still written in <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">hundreds of thousands
of lines of PHP</a>.</li>
<li>Even if a new line of shell never gets written, there will still be a <strong>huge
installed base</strong> of shell scripts that you may need to understand (e.g. when
they don't work).</li>
<li>Shell is <strong>still the best tool</strong> for many jobs.  Most new "cloud" projects
rely on Linux system images, in VMs or containers, and shell is the ideal
language for creating such images.   Even if you use a framework like Chef
or Docker, you're still using bits of shell.</li>
</ol>
<a name="shouldnt-scripts-over-100-lines-be-rewritten-in-python-or-ruby"></a>
<h3>Shouldn't scripts over 100 lines be rewritten in Python or Ruby?</h3>
<p>That's a reasonable choice in some circumstances.  If everyone on your dev team
knows Python, maintaining a shell script can be more costly than maintaining a
Python script.</p>
<p>However, Python and Ruby aren't good shell replacements in general.  Shell is a
domain-specific language for dealing with <strong>concurrent processes</strong> and the
<strong>file system</strong>.  But Python and Ruby have too much abstraction over these
concepts, sometimes in the name of portability (e.g. to Windows).  They hide
what's really going on.</p>
<p>I encountered a nice blog post, <a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/bashing-the-bash-replacing-shell-scripts-with-python-d8d201bc0989">Replacing Shell Scripts with
Python</a>, which, in my opinion, inadvertently proves the
opposite point.  The Python version is longer and has more dependencies.  In
other words, it's more difficult to write and maintain.</p>
<p>Also see the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html#the-biggest-misconception-shell-xor-python">The Biggest Misconception: Shell XOR Python</a> in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html">yesterday's
post</a>.</p>

<a name="are-you-reinventing-perl"></a>
<h3>Are you reinventing Perl?</h3>
<p>It's true that Perl is closer to shell than Python and Ruby are.  For example,
the <code>perl -pie</code> idiom can take the place of <code>awk</code> and <code>sed</code>.  However, Perl isn't
an acceptable shell either:</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't have true pipelines (of processes).  I believe you have to "shell
out" for this.</li>
<li>It doesn't have a concept of file descriptor state.  How do you write the
equivalent of <code>my_shell_func 2&gt; err.txt</code>, where <code>my_shell_func</code> can invoke
both functions and external commands?</li>
<li>Perl has a function called <code>grep()</code>, but the real <code>grep</code> is better for many
problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perl has been around for more than 30 years, and hasn't replaced shell.  It
hasn't replaced <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> either.</li>
<li>Perl 6 and Python 3 are both less-suited to shell-like problems than their
predecessors.  In other words, we still need a new shell.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it's true that, in some respects, Oil is retreading the same ground as
Perl.  But Oil is more faithful to shell, and its syntax uses fewer punctuation
characters.  In other words, it's less like "line noise".</p>
<p>Threads:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/7lsajn/oil_shell_03_release/drp7jv6/">Perl vs Shell</a> (reddit)</li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16228941">Are you reinventing Perl?</a> (Hacker News)</li>
</ul>
<a name="im-still-angry-and-i-dont-want-you-to-create-a-new-shell"></a>
<h3>I'm still angry, and I don't want you to create a new shell.</h3>
<p>You might be angry because you had to maintain a nasty shell script written by
a coworker.</p>
<p>If that's the case, you should be helping Oil succeed!  The only way to "kill
bash" is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reimplement it, then</li>
<li>Gradually migrate away from it.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is analogous to how Facebook is moving away from PHP by developing a
similar, but cleaner, language called <a href="http://hacklang.org/">Hack</a>.</p>
<p>Perl, Python, and Ruby have all existed for over 25 years, but they haven't

<p>(Oil also has some similarity to <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>, which smoothed over some of
JavaScript's rough edges and added syntactic sugar, but didn't stray from its
core execution model.  CoffeeScript was a success because it influenced
subsequent versions of JavaScript.)</p>
<a name="should-i-limit-myself-to-posix-shell-scripts"></a>
<h3 id="limit-to-posix">Should I limit myself to POSIX shell scripts?</h3>
<p>I've seen this suggestion a lot, and there are entire books devoted to it.  If
your script is <strong>small</strong>, it may be a reasonable goal.</p>
<p>For bigger programs, limiting yourself to POSIX is not just inconvenient, it's
also an ill-defined and virtually untestable concept.  Evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Debian project created a minimal shell variant called <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a>, which
replaced <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.  However, <code>dash</code> and the <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#scripts">Debian Policy on Shell
Scripts</a> both allow non-POSIX features, like <code>local</code>.  Local
variables are essential for writing maintainable shell scripts, but POSIX
doesn't mention them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most shells <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-bash/2018-01/msg00000.html">parse assignment builtins differently than other
builtins</a>, but the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-grammar#posix-grammar">POSIX shell grammar</a>
has no notion of an assignment.  This issue surfaced as early as 2010, but as
of 2018, it's not in a published spec.</p>
<p>This issue <strong>isn't theoretical</strong> — <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a> differ in
practice, but POSIX doesn't specify which is correct.</p>
<p>In other words, POSIX is incomplete and out of date.  (However, I've
discovered that shells are highly conformant with respect to things the
standard <strong>does</strong> specify.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As of 2021, I believe that OSH is a "better POSIX".  POSIX is a <strong>descriptive</strong>
specification and not a <strong>normative</strong> one. That means that it's an observation
of how popular shells like <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=ksh#ksh">ksh</a> and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> happened to behave at a certain
time.  In other words, it's a compromise.</p>
<p>Similarly, OSH is based on <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/06/22.html">extensive testing</a> of the behavior of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>,
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a>, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mksh#mksh">mksh</a>, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=zsh#zsh">zsh</a>, and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=busybox#busybox">busybox</a> <code>ash</code>.  That is, it uses the
same philosophy as POSIX, but it specifies more of the language.  Roughly
speaking, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=spec-test#spec-test">spec tests</a> are an <strong>executable specification</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-bash/2018-01/msg00002.html">Tilde Expansion</a>: Another case where shells diverge in practice, but
POSIX is silent.</li>
</ul>

<a name="how-can-you-design-a-good-language-on-top-of-shell"></a>
<h3>How can you design a good language on top of shell?</h3>
<p>POSIX shell has global options that affect parsing and execution like <code>set -o noglob</code>.  And <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> extends them with options like <code>shopt -s lastpipe</code>.</p>
<p>Oil continues in the same vein, adding several shell options under <code>s…</code></p></div>

            The Culture War: Iain M. Banks’s Billionaire Fans    </h3>                    
<h4><strong>Why Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos love Iain M. Banks’ anarcho-communist space opera</strong>.</h4>



<p><strong>by Kurt Schiller</strong></p>



<p>Explicitly ideological fiction is as old as fiction itself. From ancient steles that boasted unconvincingly of the glorious defeat of the Sea Peoples to the biased histories of that ancient greek fabulist Herodotus, humans have always had a tendency to entangle ideology and entertainment.</p>



<p>And if anything, the last hundred years have only seen this tendency grow. Fiction—whether the written word or newer mediums—has remained a popular standard-bearer for ideologies as diverse as technocratic liberalism (<em>The West Wing</em>), free market right-libertarianism (<em>Atlas Shrugged</em>, <em>The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</em>), socialism (<em>The Jungle</em>, <em>The Iron Heel</em>), and even violent white supremacy (<em>The Turner Diaries</em>, <em>The Camp of the Saints</em>). And in the 21st century, the ideological implications of media consumption have become as micro-targeted as the media themselves: if you are a “true American patriot”, you might consume such jingoistic potboilers as <em>13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi </em>or the suburbs-vs-antifa thriller <em>The Reliant</em>. If you are a god-fearing evangelical, perhaps <em>Assassin 33 A.D.</em> or the Kevin Sorbo-fronted <em>God’s Not Dead </em>series are more your speed. Seeking to seize the means? Perhaps you can first seize a controller and dig into <em>Tonight We Riot</em> or Disco Elysium.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="460" height="276" src="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks.jpg 460w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"></figure></div>



<p>Meanwhile, the reverse has also become true: “If a particular piece of media reeks of ideological impurity,” the conventional wisdom seems to go, “why bother? Why would you let those toxic ideas into your head?”</p>



<p>For all that these notions of ideological contagion and symbology are hilariously overblown, there’s some truth to the matter. At times, reading or watching long-form fiction from someone to whom you are ideologically opposed can feel exhausting, draining, aggravating, and ultimately a bit futile—like being at a party where you simply don’t like anyone, don’t care about the discussions, and are annoyed at the food. There’s much to be gained by engaging with our rhetorical opponents… but, frankly, only up to a point.</p>



<p>What then are we to take from the distinct and quite public fascination of the two richest men in the world—Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, together worth more than $375 billion—with the sci-fi works of Iain M. Banks, an avowedly socialist author who set his far-future fiction in what might best be described as a post-scarcity, anarcho-communist utopia; a world where your Bezoses and your Musks are not just irrelevant, but actively sought out and disempowered by a society comprised of property-less workers and all-caring, mostly-benevolent A.I.s?</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>Iain M. Banks’s <em>Culture </em>series—consisting of 10 largely standalone novels and a handful of short stories published between 1987 and the author’s death in 2013—charts the intrigues, impacts, and subterfuges of a group of space-faring, far-future transhumans called The Culture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some ways, it’s an almost archetypal space opera. Tough-as-nails soldiers and shady sci-fi diplomats wage war across a variety of fantastical planets and megastructures. Massive, high-tech ships piloted by ultra-powerful self-aware A.I. called Minds have super-science duels among the stars. There are assassinations, revolutions, mass battles with hundreds of ships that play out on a grand scale (while taking only a fraction of a second in objective time).</p>



<p>At first glance, it seems like exactly what you’re imagining when you hear the phrase “space opera,” and so of course two super-wealthy spaceflight-and-sci-fi aficionados would be fans, right? After all, both men own private spaceflight contractors (Musk’s SpaceX and Bezos’s Blue Origin) and speak often of mankind’s future among the stars, with Musk <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/"><strong>proposing a mission to Mars</strong></a> and Bezos <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/11/18564655/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-moon-new-glenn"><strong>pitching a return to the moon and other intrasystem exploration</strong></a>. Seeking the stars seems to be in their blood (assuming it hasn’t been completely replaced with <a href="https://bloodknife.com/buy-happiness-here/"><strong>Soylent and whatever nootropics billionaires get</strong></a>).</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM.png" alt="" width="438" height="576" srcset="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM.png 536w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM-228x300.png 228w" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px"></figure></div>



<p>Both men have found ways to conspicuously show their fandom: Musk by <a href="https://www.tor.com/2015/01/23/elon-musk-iain-m-banks-just-read-the-instructions/"><strong>naming SpaceX rockets after Banks’s tongue-in-cheek Culture ships</strong></a> (“Just Read The Instructions,” “Of Course I Still Love You”) and a “brain interface” loosely patterned after the Culture’s neural laces; Bezos by attempting to bankroll a big-budget TV series based on the books, although this latter effort was unceremoniously canceled after Banks’s estate abruptly backed out. (Probably a wise decision, given both the challenge of adapting the material and the absurdity of one of the most exploitative corporations in the world attempting to adapt proudly far-left sci-fi.)</p>



<p>Apart from official projects, both men have made public references to Banks’s work as well—not much, but enough to know that they either really have read it, or that they were well-briefed by their PR teams.</p>



<p>“The Culture series is certainly, in terms of more modern science fiction, one of my absolute favorites,” Jeff Bezos <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2018/jeff-bezos-isdc-space-vision/"><strong>told GeekWire in 2018</strong></a>, when asked about his love for the series. ”We’re not quite at that level technologically, we’ve a lot of work to do before we get there, but there’s a utopian element to it that I find very attractive.”</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>There are ultimately two things that set the <em>Culture </em>series apart from many of its peers.</p>



<p>The first is the literary bent of the prose. Space opera (and genre fiction in general) has never <em>actually</em> looked like the “lasers and explosions” stereotype it was saddled with, but it’s worth emphasizing the depth of Banks’s characterization and strange depictions of an uncanny future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Characters grapple with trauma, identity, and crisis, and they do so without losing sight of the visceral and pulpy thrill of space opera’s inherent adventure and intrigue. Moments of quiet contemplation and deep metaphysical quandaries abound, coupled with strange literary pretensions that wouldn’t seem out of place in magical realism or literary fiction—a vast machine the size of a planet made of interlocking, nested globes, each holding a separate society; a grief-sick partner who holds their pregnancy in stasis for the better part of a century in a strange act of penance and passive-aggression; a vast extra-dimensional object that resists all attempts to analyze, communicate, or attack it, nearly sparking an interstellar war. The stories of the Culture simultaneously have a very real sense of strangeness and a deep, complex humanist bent, as if picking the best bit from multiple genres without losing the sense and feel of each constituent part.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><span><strong>Since he first came onto the literary scene in the mid-Eighties, Banks was an avowed and rather public socialist.&nbsp;</strong></span></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Perhaps this savvy genre-bending should come as no surprise, considering Banks was an established author of literary fiction before he broke through as a sci-fi writer. While he had always dreamed of writing sci-fi (and indeed wrote at least one Culture novel before breaking through as a lit-fic author), it wasn’t until his break-out literary novel <em>The Wasp Factory</em> (1984) that he was able to start selling his sci-fi manuscripts, eventually settling into a rhythm where he danced more-or-less annually between mind-bending literary fiction published under the name Iain Banks and epic sci-fi novels published under the name “Iain <em>M.</em> Banks.” (His family, Banks explained, was offended he hadn’t used his middle name—Menzies—on <em>The Wasp Factory</em>.)</p>



<p>The other thing that sets both Banks and his <em>Culture </em>books apart is their overt and uncompromising politics.</p>



<p>Since he first came onto the literary scene in the mid-Eighties, Banks was an avowed and rather public socialist. He was a member of the Scottish Socialist Party and a frequent interviewee for magazines like <em>Socialist Worker</em>, as well as an outspoken opponent of the Iraq War who campaigned for the impeachment of Tony Blair and, when that failed, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/25/hayfestival2007.hayfestival"><strong>shredded his passport and mailed the remains to 10 Downing Street</strong>.</a> He spoke openly, and passionately, about labor exploitation, anti-imperialism, the environment, and a host of other now-popular issues, most of which still languished on the edge of the discourse when Banks first hit the scene.</p>



<p>He was also never shy about intermingling his politics and his work. Indeed, he saw them as being one and the same. Nowhere is this more clear than in a <a href="http://www.vavatch.co.uk/books/banks/cultnote.htm"><strong>1994 essay titled “A Few Notes on the Culture,”</strong></a> which Banks posted to the Usenet group rec.arts.sf.written. The sprawling document is both an overview of the Culture and an exegesis on Banks’s own worldview; between paragraphs delving into the society’s naming conventions, technology, and democratic apparatuses, Banks waxed poetic about the deleterious moral impact of capitalism and market forces:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“The market, for all its (profoundly inelegant) complexities, remains a crude and essentially blind system, and is – without the sort of drastic amendments liable to cripple the economic efficacy which is its greatest claimed asset – intrinsically incapable of distinguishing between simple non-use of matter resulting from processal superfluity and the acute, prolonged and wide-spread suffering of conscious beings.</em></p><p><em>It is, arguably, in the elevation of this profoundly mechanistic (and in that sense perversely innocent) system to a position above all other moral, philosophical and political values and considerations that humankind displays most convincingly both its present intellectual [immaturity and] – through grossly pursued selfishness rather than the applied hatred of others – a kind of synthetic evil.”</em></p><cite>Iain M. Banks, “A Few Notes on the Culture”</cite></blockquote>



<p>These same politics have been front and center in Banks’s conception of the Culture, a group he affectionately described as “hippie commies with hyper-weapons and a deep distrust of both Marketolatry and Greedism.”</p></div></div>

<p>I like poker, but I’m better at chess.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png" alt="Poker vs chess" width="499" height="451" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-347x314.png 347w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-694x628.png 694w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-768x695.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-1536x1389.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px"></a></p>
<p>Poker can be a lot of fun if you have a witty enough group of friends and a generous snack budget. There’s nothing worse than playing poker with a bunch of serious gamblers who think conversation and choice of hot wing spiciness are potential tells.</p>
<p>I like chess because nothing is hidden. I don’t like leaving things to chance, and I’m often foolish enough to believe I can figure out how to win if I have all the information.</p>
<p>In chess, there are no missing pieces. There isn’t a sneaky queen that your opponent can place on the board when you least expect it. Everything is in the open. The strategy and tactics are entirely determined by what is sitting in front of you in plain sight.</p>
<p>If I try to play poker the way I play chess, I’m going to lose. I can’t see all the cards. Information is hidden from me, and it’s information I need to make the right decisions.</p>
<p>If you can’t stand the uncertainty of poker, don’t do a startup. Don’t do an innovation project.</p>
<p>Innovation is like poker.</p>

<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png" alt="A group of people playing poker" width="599" height="441" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-427x314.png 427w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-853x628.png 853w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-768x565.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-1536x1130.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>

<h2>The Rules of Startup Poker</h2>
<p>This is not an ordinary game of poker. (So don’t worry if you’re not a poker player, this will still make sense.) I will stretch the analogy of Texas Hold ‘Em as far as I can in this special variation of Startup Poker.</p>
<p>Each player needs to pay the ante to play. This is a cheap game, so we’ll keep the ante at $1. Those are the costs of running an innovation project.</p>
<p>Each player gets dealt two cards that they can keep hidden. These cards represent the organization’s unique capabilities and business model — what they already have when they start.</p>

<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png" alt="A group of people playing poker part 2" width="599" height="450" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-418x314.png 418w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-836x628.png 836w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-768x577.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-1536x1154.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>As a normal Texas Hold ‘Em game progresses, the dealer will turn over additional cards in the middle of the table, which each player can use as part of their hand. First there are the three cards called “the Flop,” which are turned over at the same time. Then a fourth card is turned, which is called “Fourth Street” or “The Turn.” The last card is “the River.” Players can place bets before each of these rounds, trying to raise the stakes and force other players to fold.</p>

<p>In Startup Poker, all these shared cards represent the Market. The first three cards are “the Early Adopters.” The fourth card is “the Early Majority” and the last is “the Late Majority.” As the game goes on, the Market matures and players discover if they hold the winning hand.</p>
<p>The winner of the game is the person who has the best fit between the cards in their hand (which represents their business model) and the cards on the table (the Market). We can think of this as Product / Market fit or Business Model / Market fit.</p>

<p>The basic setup is the same, but remember, we are not playing regular Texas Hold ‘Em. Our rules are a bit different.</p>
<h2>Information Costs Money</h2>
<p>In Startup Poker, players have to ante another $1 every round to stay in. This is the cost of product development. (For our purposes, we are eliminating the standard Hold’em practice of “blinds,” which is a form of uneven antes.).</p>
<p>Additionally, instead of every round beginning by flipping over Market cards, players can get a preview by paying an additional $1 for each card. (In real poker, everyone sees the flipped card, but in our version you’re paying for a sneak peek.)</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png" alt="A poker player peeking at a flipped card" width="699" height="514" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-427x314.png 427w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-853x628.png 853w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-768x565.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-1536x1130.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>This is the equivalent of funding an <a href="https://kromatic.com/workshops/building-and-resourcing-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="innovation team" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked">innovation team</a> to gather Market information. This investment isn’t really just money, it’s blood, sweat, and tears. But since people * time = money, we’ll just use our poker chips to represent this investment. The team is really going out into the real world, talking to customers, putting up a landing page, or running some other form of experiment or research to gather information.</p>
<p>At that point, they have the option to kill the idea (fold) or persevere before a round of betting.</p>
<p>Should we go straight ahead and bet on our hand? Or should we buy a peek at the Market first?</p>
<h2>Bet It All in Waterfall</h2>
<p>We could just close our eyes and bet it all on our pair of jacks. This is the equivalent of <a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/lean-startup-in-the-enterprise-anti-pattern-the-lean-waterfall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfall development</a>, where we place our bets and literally let the cards fall where they may.</p>
<p>We believe our cards are the correct ones for the Market, despite having not seen a single card from that Market. So we are placing a lot of faith in our business model and capabilities — our pair of jacks — and to be fair, that is a formidable hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png" alt="A player risking it all to bet in a poker game" width="599" height="405" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-465x314.png 465w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-929x628.png 929w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-768x519.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-1536x1038.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>But we’ve invested for the long hall, so we push it all in and check the snack bar while the hand plays out. But the Market isn’t kind. Our opponent starts with a 2 and a 4, but winds up closing a 2-6 straight with the 3, 5 and 6 from the Market. We lose to a weaker starting hand that ended up being better for that Market. We end up sitting in the corner binging on Pringles and lukewarm beer for the rest of the night while everyone else keeps playing, but that’s a risk of Waterfall.</p>
<h2>Information Has Value</h2>
<p>So instead of going all-in based on our business model and capabilities, should we buy that peek at the Market if we’re holding a pair of jacks?</p>
<p>The answer here is yes. Obviously so.</p>
<p>If everyone is sneaking a peek at the next card except you, you are at a huge disadvantage. Now they are playing chess because they can see more of the board. Meanwhile, you think you are still playing poker.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png" alt="A player playing chess blindfolded" width="512" height="565" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png 1812w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-285x314.png 285w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-569x628.png 569w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-768x847.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-1392x1536.png 1392w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></p>
<p>True, they still can’t see their opponents’ hole cards, so they don’t have all the information, but they have more than you.</p>
<p>So should you pay for the peek no matter what you are holding in your hand? Well, that depends on the cost.</p>
<h2>Don’t Play Every Hand</h2>
<p>If you start the game with a 2 of spades and a 9 of hearts, you have a bad hand. It’s not worth getting Market information because you are woefully unprepared for any Market. You might get lucky and find three twos on the board, but that’s a longshot. The odds are that someone else has a better hand. Just fold and play the next hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png" alt="2 Of spades and 9 of hearts" width="399" height="354" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-354x314.png 354w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-708x628.png 708w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-768x682.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-1536x1363.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px"></a></p>
<p>For large organizations, this is the equivalent of having an idea that is fundamentally mismatched with the company.</p>
<p>“Let’s make vegan hamburgers,” says the mining company.</p>
<p>This makes no sense. It is the 2/9 offsuit of business ideas. Let’s skip this idea and work on something with a little more promise.</p>
<h2>Pivoting</h2>
<p>In the real world, startups aren’t stuck with the cards that they are dealt. If something isn’t working with their business model, they can pivot.</p>
<p>You can also alter your product in Startup Poker, because after you peek at the cards on the board, we let you trade the cards in your hand — for a price. Each round, each player has the opportunity to trade in one card at a cost of $1. It’s an option to change your product / business model after you’ve gotten a taste of the market.</p>
<p>So let’s say you start with a pair of twos — one heart and one spade. You pay $3 to peek at three cards. They are the three, four, and five of hearts.</p>
<p>You might want to trade in your two of spades and get a new card from the deck, giving yourself a shot at a flush, a straight, or a straight flush.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png" alt="Early adopters vs business model" width="599" height="585" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-321x314.png 321w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-643x628.png 643w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-768x750.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-1536x1501.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>You are exercising an option to find a better fit with the Market. It’s only the information that you’ve gained by buying a peek at the Market that makes this pivot worthwhile.</p>
<h2>Arrogance</h2>
<p>Let’s face it, arrogance never helps in chess or in poker. Everytime I get cocky in chess, I lose.</p>
<p>Chess rankings are highly visible when playing. So when I relax for my lunchtime game and see that I’m playing someone with a rating 200 points below me, I know I’m going to win. Which is of course exactly when I’m going to lose.</p>
<p>I’m so confident in winning that I start checking my Slack messages while playing. Then I draft an email. Then I make some tea. I get distracted, forget my plan, and generally make a stupid mistake.</p>
<p>“Bad luck!” But there is no luck in chess — this is the folly of arrogance.</p>
<p>If we really wanted to make Startup Poker realistic, every player would be forced to drink 5 shots of bourbon before playing, then when they look at the two cards in their hand they’ll be convinced they have three of a kind. Every entrepreneur thinks they are the second coming of Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>Confidence is great. Good entrepreneurs don’t go into a market without some level of confidence. But arrogance allows your confidence to overrule your judgement.</p>
<h2>The Size of the Pot</h2>
<p>There’s another oddity to Startup Poker in that no one knows exactly how big the pot is. It is somewhat determined by the antes that people are paying in and the bets being made, but mostly it’s determined by the Market.</p>
<p>Of course, people can bet up the pot and force players to invest more to keep up. It’s the same as startups competing against each other. When one buys advertising, the others better match it or have a better strategy.</p>
<p>To calculate the value of the Market, we add up the value of the cards to determine the size of the pot (numbered cards are worth their face value, royal cards are worth $10, and aces are worth $15). So this makes buying Market information even more important.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png" alt="The size of the pot" width="699" height="356" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-600x306.png 600w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-1200x612.png 1200w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-768x391.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-1536x783.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>Don’t waste your money and time playing for a small pot.</p>
<h2>Crowded Markets</h2>
<p>Lastly, look at who is competing. It can be very compelling to play in a game with fewer people. Remember, the size of the prize is mostly determined by the Market, not the amount of competition. Unfortunately, in Startup Poker, players can join the game at any time.</p>
<p>When the dealer starts turning over Market cards, players who have not anteed up to that point can opt in. Of course at first they are at a disadvantage. They have missed at least one opportunity to get advanced information, and they’ve lost at least one opportunity to pivot. But they can still get into the Market — a Market that you’ve already invested in.</p>
<p>So if the first two cards the Market shows are a King and Jack, that’s $20 already in the pot. That might attract some latecomers to the game, and the competition might increase quickly.</p>

<p>Players who find themselves alone in a game at the early stages should still take advantage of the opportunity to get more information early, and to pivot if necessary. Even if …</p></div></div>

<p>A realistic look at Python web frameworks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you take a look around the blogosphere at various benchmarks for Python web frameworks, you might start to feel pretty bad about your own setup. Or, alternatively, super-hyped about the possibilities.</p><p>Consider, for instance, the incredible work of the guys at <a href="https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/">magic stack</a>, getting <strong>100,000 requests per second</strong> from <a href="https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop">uvloop</a> in a single thread. This is on par with compiled language like Go's performance.</p><p>But that benchmark doesn't really cover a fully fleshed out web framework, right? We need a lot more functionality and structure from our frameworks than reading and writing bytes. What about fully fleshed-out web-frameworks in python?</p><p>One such framework is <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a>, which again has been shown to have similar performance: <strong>100,000</strong> requests per-second. Or there's <a href="https://vibora.io/">Vibora</a>. Not only does this claim to be a drop-in replacement for <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, but it also has its own templating engine. And it handles <strong>350,000 requests per second</strong>!</p><p>Even more mind-blowing is <a href="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto">Japronto</a> which claims an insane <strong>1.2 million requests per-second</strong> in a single thread 🤯 trouncing the performance of other languages and frameworks:</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squeaky-pl/japronto/master/benchmarks/results.png" alt="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto"></p><p>Recently we've been doing a lot of work improving the performance of our Python APIs. Currently we're running <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, and we initially had a single question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread? </em>But looking at these benchmarks had us asking more:</p><ol><li>Can we meaningfully compare them to our setup?</li><li>How realistic are they for a full production application?</li><li>Would we be better using one of these frameworks over Flask?</li></ol><p>In other words, how much should we trust these benchmarks? And to what extent should they influence our choice of technology?</p><p>In order to answer these questions, in this post, I benchmark a realistic Flask application along with it's <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a> equivalent. I'm going to guess that most readers come from a background with one of the more "traditional" Python frameworks (<a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a> or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>), and it's certainly more relevant to devs here at Suade Labs. For this reason, I run the Flask app in a number of different ways, to see what the best bang for our buck is: how performant can we make our application with (almost) zero changes to the code? Along the way we'll pick up some tips for the original question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread?</em></p><p><strong>Sidenote: </strong>if you're new to Python's web frameworks, or its asynchronous libraries, take a look at [1] from the addenda at the bottom of this post for a quick explainer. This post mostly assumes you know these things.</p><h2 id="the-baseline">The baseline</h2><p>First let's run some simple "Hello, World!" benchmarks on our system to get a meaningful baseline for comparison. For reference, the Flask benchmarks on <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r18&amp;hw=ph&amp;test=fortune&amp;l=zijzen-f">techempower</a> give 25,000 requests per second.</p><p>Here's our Flask app:</p><pre><code>app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def hello():
    if request.method == "GET":
        return "Hello, World!"

    data = request.get_json(force=True)
    try:
        return "Hello, {id}".format(**data)
    except KeyError:
        return "Missing required parameter 'id'", 400</code></pre><p>I ran it under a variety of conditions. First "raw" via <code>python app.py</code>, and then under <a href="https://gunicorn.org/">Gunicorn</a> with a single <code>sync</code> worker via <code>gunicorn -k sync app:app</code> and finally Gunicorn with a single <a href="https://github.com/gevent/gevent">gevent</a> worker via <code>gunicorn -k gevent app:app</code>. In theory Gunicorn should handle concurrency and dropped connections much better than the raw python, and using the gevent worker should allow us to do asynchronous IO without changing our code [2a]. We also ran these benchmarks under <a href="https://www.pypy.org/">PyPy</a>, which in theory should speed up any CPU-bound code without making any changes (if you haven't heard of PyPy see [2b] in the addenda below for a quick explanation and some terminology).</p><p>And what about Sanic? Well, here's the "rewrite" of our app:</p><pre><code>app = Sanic(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
async def hello(request):
    if request.method == "GET":
        return text("Hello, World!")

    data = request.json
    try:
        return text("Hello, {id}".format(**data))
    except KeyError:
        raise InvalidUsage("Missing required parameter 'id'")</code></pre><p>And here are the results:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1000w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1161w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><div><p>Some technical details: I used Python 3.7 with the regular CPython interpreter and Python 3.6 with PyPy 7.3.3. At the time of writing, running 3.6 is the latest PyPy interpreter, and their Python 2.7 interpreter is faster in some edge cases, but as Python 2 is <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/">officially dead</a>, I don't believe it productive to benchmark. My system details are available in the addenda [3]. I used <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a> to actually execute the benchmarks.</p><p>I'll break the results down in two parts. First: Sanic dominates, with 23,000 requests a second, although running our Flask app under Guncorn + gevent and PyPy does a pretty good job at keeping up. Second: what's going on with the performance range for our Flask app?</p></div><p>Under CPython, we see that using Gunicorn quadruples the number of Flask requests per second from 1,000 to 4,000 and using a gevent worker adds a mild (sub 10%) speed boost to this. The PyPy results are more impressive. In the raw test, it is churning through 3,000 requests a second; it received the same 4x speed boost from Gunicorn, getting us to 12,000 requests a second; finally with the addition of gevent, it cranks up to 17,000 requests a second, 17x more than the raw CPython version without changing a single line of code.</p><p>I was quite struck by the fact that gevent had such little effect on the CPython process - probably this is because the CPU is maxed out at this point. On the other hand, it seems that PyPy's better speed means it is still spending time waiting on system calls / IO, even under Gunicorn. Adding gevent to the mix means that it switches between concurrent connections, processing them as fast as the CPU will let it.</p><p>To get a real sense of this, I ran the benchmark whilst monitoring CPU usage. Here's a short test against the raw app under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 919w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>You can see that the program hops between CPU cores and rarely utilises 100% of a given core. On the other hand, here's part of a much longer test against the Gunicorn gevent worker under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 900w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now it's evident that there is no switching between CPU cores (the process has become "sticky") and the individual core is being utilised to a far higher degree.</p><p><strong>Key takeaways</strong>: Sanic wins. PyPy is fast. Run your "traditional" app under Gunicorn.</p><h2 id="realistic-benchmarks">Realistic benchmarks</h2><div><p>The benchmark above, while fun, is pretty meaningless for real-world applications. Let's add some more functionality to our app!</p><p>First, we'll allow users to actually store data in a database, which we'll retrieve via an ORM (in our case <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>, the de-facto stand-alone ORM in python). Second, we'll add input-validation to make sure our users get meaningful error messages, and that we're not accepting junk that crashes our app. Finally we'll add a response marshaller to automate the process of converting our database object to JSON.</p></div><p>We'll write a simple book store app, for a publishing house. We have a number of authors each writing zero or more books in several genres. For simplicity, each book has only a single author, but can have multiple genres - for example we could have a book which is in both the "Existential Fiction" and "Beatnik Poetry" categories. We're going to add 1 million authors to our database and roughly 10 million books. [4]</p><p>Our SQLAlchemy models look a little like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(UUIDType, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    ... # snip!

class Book(db.Model):
    author_id = db.Column(
        UUIDType, db.ForeignKey("author.id"), nullable=False, index=True
    )
    author = db.relationship("Author", backref="books")
    ... # snip!
</code></pre>
<p>To marshal these, we use <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a>, which is a popular Python marshalling library. Here's an example of the Marshmallow model for the Author overview:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(Schema):
    id = fields.Str(dump_only=True)
    name = fields.Str(required=True)
    country_code = EnumField(CountryCodes, required=True)
    email = fields.Str(required=True)
    phone = fields.Str(required=True)
    contact_address = fields.Str(required=True)
    contract_started = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_finished = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_value = fields.Integer()
</code></pre>
<p>In our endpoints these are used for validating input and returning results like so:</p>
<pre><code>@bp.route("/author", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def author():
    """View all authors, or create a new one."""

    if request.method == "GET":
        args = validate_get(marshallers.LimitOffsetSchema())
        limit = args["limit"]
        offset = args["offset"]

        authors = Author.query.limit(limit).offset(offset).all()
        return jsonify(marshallers.authors.dump(authors))

    if request.method == "POST":
        author = Author(**validate_post(marshallers.author))

        db.session.add(author)
        db.session.commit()

        return jsonify({"id": author.id})
</code></pre>
<p>The full source code can be viewed in the <a href="https://github.com/olliemath/async_python">GitHub repo</a>. Here, the thing to note is that <code>marshallers.foo</code> is an instance of a <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a> schema, which can be used both to validate a Foo input, for instance in a POST request, as well as to marshal Foo instances ready for returning as JSON.</p>
<p>In order to actually perform asynchronous database requests, some fancy footwork is required with patching libraries, which depends on which postgres connector you use. SQLAlchemy does not support this out of the box, and in fact its primary developer has a great post arguing that <a href="https://techspot.zzzeek.org/2015/02/15/asynchronous-python-and-databases/">an async ORM is not always a great idea</a>. Juicy technical details in addenda [5], but beware that just using a Gunicorn gevent worker will not necessarily get you what you want.</p><p>PyPy tends to suffer a performance hit when using C-extensions and libraries instead of pure python, conversely CPython should get a performance boost from the C-based libs. To take account of this I tested two different underlying database connectors: both <a href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2">psycopg2</a> and a …</p></div></section></article></div></div>

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>I’ll admit it—I’m a bit of a sex toy elitist. Both in starting this blog and in my own bedroom, I tend toward stronger, fancier, longer-lasting toys with price tags to match. If I’m going to buy something, I’d rather wait to save up than make compromises—which is why Womanizer’s “The One” and Satisfyer’s “One Night Stand” pulsating air toys caught me off-guard. These very similar toys cost only ten dollars each and are positioned as tasters, giving users a chance to try this relatively new type of stimulation without shelling out the roughly $60+ for a fully-featured model.</p>
<p>The catch? They’re completely disposable, with the Satisfyer lasting 90 minutes and the Womanizer tapping out after a mere half hour. That’s it. There’s no recharging or replacing batteries unless you can hack the device (read on…). Both toys are programmed to brick themselves after the allotted time, even before the sealed AAA batteries are completely dead.</p>
<p>This seems like a bad idea. Let’s give it a go!</p>
<figure><ul><li><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="748" src="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Packaging-1-1024x748.jpg" alt="" data-id="139" data-full-url="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Packaging-1-scaled.jpg" data-link="https://insidesextoys.com/2021/01/disposable-waves/packaging-1/" srcset="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Packaging-1-1024x748.jpg 1024w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Packaging-1-300x219.jpg 300w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Packaging-1-768x561.jpg 768w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Packaging-1-1536x1122.jpg 1536w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Packaging-1-2048x1495.jpg 2048w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Packaging-1-1200x876.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"></figure></li></ul><figcaption>From left to right, the strikingly similar packaging for the Satisfyer One Night Stand and Womanizer The One</figcaption></figure>
<p>When the toys arrived (in suspiciously similar packaging), I enlisted my girlfriend, an established pulse toy fan, to lend me a hand in testing them out. While both feel robust for their price point, we agreed that the Satisfier distinguished itself with a slightly more solid and streamlined feeling in the hand. Only the Womanizer’s removable silicone head makes it possible to clean between sessions or users, if that matters given its 30-minutes service life. Initial impressions made, we started a timer, set both toys on their most powerful settings, and settled in for some playtime.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with air pulse toys, they basically use a small, oscillating silicone cup to stimulate through light, pulsing suction, usually on the clit. They create a sensation slightly different from a traditional vibrator, and they can often be much quieter.</p>
<p>The Womanizer feels rumblier, while the Satisfier is buzzier and more powerful, as if the Satisfier has a higher pulse frequency but the Womanizer has a slightly greater amplitude. Especially when used on my frenulum, the Womanizer’s protruding, soft silicone head makes it easier to create a comfortable suction seal for strong, focused stimulation where the Satisfyer’s more plastic-y head cannot. Both toys fit to my girlfriend’s clit well and created nice gentle stimulation, especially when stronger settings were paired with a bit of lube to enhance the seal. We both would have preferred more intense stimulation from both toys, and the finer control offered by the Satisfyer’s four power settings compared to the Womanizer’s three didn’t make much difference.</p>
<p>While neither toy is quite as strong or comfortable in the hand as their multi-use siblings like the Satisfyer Pro 2, my girlfriend and I agreed that they are generally pleasant to use. They stayed true to their stated time limits with no noticeable change in power, diligently shutting off at exactly 30 and 90 minutes, respectively.</p>
<p>But, when the Satisfyer shut itself off and the dust settled, neither of us had even gotten close to cumming.</p>
<p>Both toys disappoint for one simple reason: it’s hard to get off when you can’t stop watching the clock. Even with the Satisfyer’s more generous 90-minute timer, knowing that your sex toy is counting down the seconds to oblivion like a masturbatory time-bomb is just not sexy, a flaw only exacerbated by the fact that, unlike vibrating dildos, air pulse toys are truly useless without their powered functions. These factors combine to create a sense of designed hostility; these toys are literally designed to let you down.</p>
<p>And that’s not even the worst part.</p>
<p>To put it mildly, selling an item designed to turn itself into e-waste in the course of an evening is wildly unethical, especially without so much as a recycling program or pay-to-unlock system to lessen the environmental impact. Both the Satisfyer and Womanizer utilize a sealed clamshell design and mix of plastics that will make them hard for electronics recyclers to deal with, and, as shown in the Teardown section of this post, the disposable nature of both toys is purely profit- rather than design-driven. Womanizer’s parent Wow Tech and Satisfyer should seriously reconsider this product category.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Teardown</strong></p>

<p>Now that both toys’ timers have run out, it’s time to dive in, see what makes them tick, and find out if we can hack our way around that pesky self-bricking “feature.”</p>

<p>Beginning with the Satisfyer, pulling the rather beefy two-piece ABS clamshell apart reveals the mysteries within. The injection-molded halves of the case are impressively designed, with neat alignment pins to keep the two sections together and tight tolerances on interior features that hold components in place with a friction fit. Often a surprisingly hard thing to get right, this mold has clearly been made with care.</p>

<p>Near the bottom of the device sits a lone, small PCB with control circuitry powered by two standard AAA batteries, which largely account for the toy’s weight and robust feeling. Towards the top left sits a small DC motor, which rotates a lubricated semi-flexible linkage to oscillate the toy’s silicone diaphragm and create air pulses. Even after 90 minutes of use, the batteries were far from flat, and the diaphragm linkage assembly rotated smoothly, confirming my suspicion that the toy’s time limit is enforced in firmware rather than the result of some hardware limitation.</p>

<p>A closer look at the two-layer PCB doesn’t reveal much. The circuit consists of just one unmarked IC, two ceramic capacitors, a diode, a resistor, and a pushbutton for user input. The IC is almost certainly a very simple microcontroller, but, without any further clues as to its provenance or an immediately responsive reset pin, I decided to save my hacking efforts for the Womanizer.</p>

<p>The Womanizer’s ABS case stubbornly resists prying, but cutting some of its internal pins with a rotary tool allows for easy access. While this toy’s outer ABS case is slightly simpler, it contains two other plastic parts that clip the components together.</p>

<p>The toy operates on the same principle as the Satisfier, using a small DC motor to oscillate a silicone diaphragm, this time with a slightly tighter, better-made linkage. However, the Womanizer uses just one AAA battery and is controlled by a significantly more complicated circuit.</p>

Voltage regulators boost the single battery’s voltage to a suitable level for driving the motor while another small microcontroller, this time an A262AFB, provides the brains of the operation. I couldn’t find any information on this particular chip, but the board’s silkscreen provides some clues. Most notably, the via marked “CLEAR” creates the tantalizing suggestion of a way to reset the chip, hopefully allowing for another 30 minutes of play time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, after significant experimenting and poking around, it does not seem that either of vias near the “CLEAR” label is a true reset line, although all is not lost. Connecting both via’s simultaneously to the base of transistor T1 often (though not always) seems to glitch and reset the device. Just like that, the Womanizer is back in action for another 30 minutes.</p>

<p>A small switch between these two points allows for easy glitching by rapidly disconnecting and reconnecting them, and it even conveniently fits into the little access hole I cut to open the Womanizer in the first place. Now I can glitch the microcontroller for effectively unlimited 30-minute cycles.</p>
<p>Sketchy? Yes! Beautiful? Also yes!</p>
<p>All things considered, both the Womanizer’s The One and the Satisfyer One Night Stand are examples of good technical design applied to a terrible product strategy. They feel good in the hand, are mechanically solid enough to survive a few drops and run far longer than their intended service life, and create air pulse stimulation that, while far from earth-shattering, is impressive for their $10 price point. Without the lines of code make them useless after little more than one play session, I’d be buying them as gifts and recommending them to everyone I know. </p>
<p>Sometimes, hackable sex toys are fun, encouraging me to explore and think up quirky new features to make them truly feel like <em>mine</em>. But the fact remains that very few people have the tools, skills, or time to cut and solder a bricked Womanizer into a real, semi-usable sex toy. Instead, both The One and The One Night Stand leave me with a bad taste in my mouth, teasing the nice, affordable products they <em>could have been</em> before being undermined by environmentally ruinous programmed disposability.</p>

<!-- TODO: middle1 -->

  

    
    <div>
        <p>LONDON. <strong>Mr Pascal Soriot, CEO of AstraZeneca, why hasn't AstraZeneca been more specific on detailing the supply problem detected on its European plants? What exactly is the problem? &nbsp;</strong></p>

<div><p>“I think we have been relatively specific with the information. Of course, we are all very disappointed. We would like to produce more. I think we will deliver up to Europe in the month of February a reasonable quantity actually, very similar to what others have delivered on a monthly basis. But of course, it's less than expected and also because our vaccine is easy to use people expected more so we could scale up.&nbsp;Our team is working 24/7 to fix the very much issues of production of the vaccine itself. You have two steps in the production of a vaccine: one is you produce the vaccine itself. We call it a drug substance, the vaccine. Then, when we are finished with it, we move this into different plants where we put the vaccine into vials and we call that the drug product, the final product.&nbsp;For Europe the drugs substance is essentially produced in two plants, one in the Netherlands, one in Belgium. The drug product is actually produced in Italy and Germany. So from a drug product viewpoint, we have full capacity. We have zero problem. The current problems have to do with manufacturing the drugs substance”. &nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
“So maybe I need to give you a little bit of explanation as to how we manufacture those vaccines. Essentially, we have cell cultures, big batches, 1000-litre or 2000-litre batches. We have cell cultures inside those batches and we inject them with the virus, the vaccine, if you will. Then those cells produce the vaccine, it’s a biotechnology protection. Now, some of those batches have very high yield and others have low yield. Particularly in Europe, we had one site with large capacity that experienced yield issues. So it's essentially a question of when you scale up to the level we are scaling up to - &nbsp;something like this that's never been done. We are scaling up to hundreds of millions, billions of doses of vaccines at a very high speed".</p></div>

<div><p>“A year ago, we didn't have a vaccine. When you do that, you have glitches, you have scale-up problems. Therefore, the yield varies from one to three, by the factor of three. The best site we have produces three times more vaccine out of a batch than the lowest producing site. We do this with a series of partners: in the US, those partners are actually approved by BARDA, the US administration, the group that manages those things and manages the capacity”.</p></div><p>
"In the US, we also have issues of yield and essentially our engineers have worked with our partners to identify what the issues are. We believe we have sorted out the issues now. The issues are different, for instance, in Belgium: we believe it was more a question of downstream filtering because when you finish making the vaccine, you have to filter it. When you filter it, you put it into vials.&nbsp;Our partner in Australia for instance also had yield issues. And they have been in the vaccine business for 20 years. But it's complicated, especially in the early phase where you have to really kind of sort out all sorts of issues. We believe we've sorted out those issues, but we are basically two months behind where we wanted to be. We've had also teething issues like this in the UK supply chain.&nbsp;But the UK contract was signed three months before the European vaccine deal. So with the UK we have&nbsp; had an extra three months to fix all the glitches we experienced. As for Europe, we are three months behind in fixing those glitches. Would I like to do better? Of course. But, you know, if we deliver in February what we are planning to deliver, it's not a small volume. We are planning to deliver millions of doses to Europe, it is not small”.</p>

<div><p><strong>You say that EU is going to receive a reasonable quantity of doses by February. Could you please quantify this?</strong><br>
"First of all, as soon as we get an approval by EMA, in the next few days, we will be shipping at least three million doses immediately to Europe, then we'll have another shipment about a week later and then the third or fourth week of February. And the target is to deliver 17 million doses by February. So, I am just estimating roughly, that would mean like about 3 million doses for Germany, probably 2,5 million for Italy and something like 2 million for Spain. I don't know exactly what the precise allocation is, but it's based on the population of each country. If you're in Germany, you can vaccinate three million people in one month. It's actually not so bad especially for the people who are the most exposed and most at risk. That's not a small proportion. And if you apply the three month regimen, then in March, you can do the same again or more potentially because we are working hard to increase our goals. It's not as good as we would like to, but it's really it's not so bad”.</p><p>
&nbsp;
<strong>So Europe signed the contract too late, instead of the UK?</strong><br>
“I will not pass judgment on this. But I can only tell you the facts and the facts are that we basically signed an agreement with the UK three months before we did have it with Europe. Now, part of this can be easily explained. When we entered the agreement with Oxford, they had already been working with the UK government on this. So they had a head start. We were able to quite quickly take the UK supply chain and improve it. We had to modify the formula in the process, because Oxford gave us a process that needed to be modified to enable manufacturing at scale.&nbsp;Just think about, we've done all of this in months. Usually, it takes years. We got a manufacturing process that Oxford gave us, which was producing a good vaccine, but not at an industrial scale. It was just able to produce quantities for clinical trials. So then we had to modify the process to turn it into a process that could manufacture billions of doses. At a cost that is reasonable and at a speed that is reasonable".</p><p>
&nbsp;
"We had to change all of these. Then we had to do what we call technology transfer. So we go to each partner and we train them on the process. We train them on how to manufacture. And then, you know, some people are new to this process. It's like they learn the process. They don't know how to make the vaccine and they're not as efficient as others".</p><p>
&nbsp;
"So you may have lower productivity. That's why we have a productivity going from one to three. And so, unfortunately, it's really bad luck. Actually, there's nothing mysterious about it. But look, the sites that have the lowest productivity in the network are the sites that are supplying Europe. And quite honestly, I mean, we're not doing it on purpose. I'm European, I have Europe at heart. Our chairman is Swedish, is European. Our CFO is European. Many people in the management are European. So we want to treat Europe as best we can. You know, we do this at no profit, remember? We didn't go into this to try and make money or whatever. We would like to treat Europe as good as possible. I actually do believe we treated Europe fairly". &nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
"Now, let me give you another number. Our total capacity globally now is about 100 million doses a month.&nbsp;From February onwards we are able to make 100 million doses a month, that's not small. Most vaccines have 100 million doses a year, that already takes us on a 1,2 billion pace per year. We are going to keep growing. Of course, we are ramping up production and Europe is getting 17 percent of this global production in February for a population that is 5 percent of the world population.&nbsp; Now, from the beginning we took very seriously the approach that Europe took, which we thought was fair and we all took. In fact, the US didn't say that Europe said that. Europe said the vaccine is common good and everybody needs to get access at the same time globally. That's what we are doing. Europe is getting 17 percent of our global supply for a month for 5 percent of the world population. The problem is: 100 million doses is a lot, but we have 7,5 billion people in the world".</p><p>
&nbsp;
"We are in the ramp-up phase and basically it will improve, but it takes time. Having said all of this, I'm not looking for excuses, honestly.&nbsp; We take accountability. We want to do better and we're working day and night. Our people in manufacturing, we have hundreds of people, thousands of people now. Many of them didn't take any Christmas vacation. I'm not asking you feel sorry for us but you know, we're doing our very best. But it's a very complicated process and a big scale”. &nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
<strong>After the explanation you just gave at the same time it is striking the aggressive way which the EU has responded, even threatning to impose a new control on exports of activity out of Europe. Some are suggesting that you're selling your product to some other countries.&nbsp; </strong><br>
“The suggestion we sell to other countries to make more money is not right because we make no profit everywhere.That's the approach we took and we agreed on that. That’s the agreement we have with Oxford University.&nbsp;It's actually even written in a contract we have with Oxford University: that we will be at no profit. We have slightly different prices from one geographic to the other because the cost of goods may be different. We have a supply chain in Brazil, we have another one in Latin America, another one in South Asia. We have one in Japan. Of course, you know, local costs are different. So you've got slight variations, but more or less, it's about three to four dollars, more or less everywhere.&nbsp;It makes no difference. Zero difference. I understand we all want to be vaccinated. I think the populations of Europe, like everywhere else in the world, have been under so much stress with this pandemic for so long …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Clean code is like clean garbage – it’s only truly clean if it doesn’t exist. In other words, the only clean code is <a aria-label="no code (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">no code</a>. Let’s start with an acknowledgment that a perfectly clean (empty) codebase is useless. With that in mind, our pursuit of clean code will necessarily consist of tradeoffs. We’ll trade usefulness for cleanliness, complexity for speed, ownership for ease of development, and abstractions for reusability.</p>
<p>DRY (don’t repeat yourself) code is often held aloft as an ideal in the quest for clean code. Before we jump in too deep, let me shamelessly plug my new computer science learning platform <a href="https://qvault.io/">Qvault</a>, check it out if you like CS and like to write code. With that over with, let’s explore why I think DRY can be a good <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/11/30/examples-of-heuristics-in-computer-science/">heuristic</a>, but far from an absolute.</p>
<h2>What is DRY Code?</h2>
<p>According to <a aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Don’t repeat yourself</strong>&nbsp;is a principle aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns,&nbsp;replacing it with abstractions or using&nbsp;data normalization&nbsp;to avoid redundancy. Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.</p></blockquote>
<p>While this definition is fairly exhaustive, what I’ve found people <em>usually</em> mean when they say “DRY code” is that when you find yourself repeating pieces of logic you should instead create a reusable function, interface, class, etc, so that you only have to maintain one copy of it. For example, take the following API calls:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">export async function updateUserHandle(handle) {
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  return await fetch(`${domain}/v1/users/handle`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      handle
    })
  });
}

export async function updateUserInterests(interestUUIDs) {
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  return await fetch(`${domain}/v1/users/interests`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      interestUUIDs
    })
  });
}</code></pre>
<p>You may have noticed, but the beginning of those two API calls are nearly identical – they handle some basic logic that checks to see if the user is properly authenticated and sends that authentication in the request. This might not be a big deal with just two API calls, but what if we have 30? Or maybe 1000? Instead, we can DRY up this code by writing a simple <code>fetchWithAuth</code> function that will centralize all the client’s authentication logic in a single place:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">async function fetchWithAuth(url, params){
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  if (!params.headers){
    params.headers = {};
  }
  params.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  return await fetch(url, params);
}

export async function updateUserHandle(handle) {
  return await fetchWithAuth(`${domain}/v1/users/handle`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      handle
    })
  });
}

export async function updateUserInterests(interestUUIDs) {
  return await fetchWithAuth(`${domain}/v1/users/interests`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      interestUUIDs
    })
  });
}</code></pre>
<h2>Why wouldn’t you DRY out your code?</h2>
<p>Seems like a good idea to reduce code duplication right? Well, yes, in general it is. That said, lets look at some of the drawbacks that come along with too much centralization.</p>
<h3>1. Too many abstractions</h3>
<p>Sometimes code is the same at a given point in time, but later on, it becomes distinct in some way. It’s really hard to guarantee that duplicate code will remain perfect copies of each other forever. A hypothetical example of this would be if the Facebook and Instagram APIs had the exact same way to create a social post. Just because they’re <em>coincidentally</em> the same, probably doesn’t mean that the logic should only be written once.</p>
<p>The solution is likely to remain disciplined about splitting out code that, while it may be similar, is only <em>coincidentally</em> similar. Try to only merge code that’s <em>fundamentally</em> the same. A great example would be a math function like <code>log2</code>. That function should work for every case that you need to calculate a logarithm – each call is fundamentally the same.</p>
<h3>2. External dependency creation</h3>
<p>If two different projects share the same logic, it can often make sense to centralize it in a library package. While this is often a great idea, it can add overhead and can end up being more trouble than it’s worth. For example, even if the abstraction makes sense, you’re definitely adding at least the following complexity to the project:</p>
<ul><li>Management of the dependencies versions and running updates regularly</li><li>Requires multi-project updates in order to get a new change to a specific dependent</li><li>Often involves more remote infrastructure like NPM or PyPy</li><li>Gets harder to make “breaking” changes to the libraries core functions – requires a higher standard of code quality and architecture</li></ul>
<h3>3. Localization complexity</h3>
<p>When debugging or reading code, it would be easiest if the flow of logic started at the top of a file and flowed in a linear path. For example:</p>
<pre><code>START PROGRAM
INSTRUCTION 0
INSTRUCTION 1
INSTRUCTION 2
INSTRUCTION 3
END PROGRAM</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, in useful programs, we need functions, classes, methods, type definitions, etc. that force us to read and write code in a non-linear way. The goal should be to keep everything as linear as possible and sacrifice linearity and simplicity for reusability and separation of concerns as necessary. Every time we extract a chunk of code from a larger function into a smaller more encapsulated one, the code becomes just a little bit harder to follow.</p>
<p>With a highly compartmentalized project, when we see a function called <code>getUser</code>, if we want to <em>really</em> know what’s going on we have to peek into that function and remember the current context because we’re now looking at a different file. Obviously, the cognitive burden becomes greater and greater the more definitions you need to jump through.</p>
<h2>Takeaways – Code smells and hueristics</h2>
<p>Since no code is perfect, we can need to make use of some heuristics (rules of thumb), to try to work towards a cleaner codebase.</p>
<h3>1. WET code, or the rule of three</h3>
<p>WET is a better rule of thumb in my opinion than DRY.</p>
<p>WET stands for “write everything twice”, and forces you to think a bit harder about whether or not a piece of logic deserves an abstraction. The rule of three is an alternative that says you should even wait until you’ve written something three times before breaking it out.</p>
<h3>2. Is it testable?</h3>
<p>Most functions should be predictable and testable. They should behave like math functions or <a aria-label="pure functions (opens in a new tab)" href="https://qvault.io/2020/09/07/how-to-make-pure-functions-in-go/#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20Pure%20Function,of%20data%20outside%20the%20function)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pure functions</a> – given a set of inputs you’ll always receive the same outputs, and the state of the program isn’t mutated. If the code you’re thinking about condensing into a function can be a pure function, then it’s likely a better idea than if it were an impure function.</p>
<p>Pure functions are really easy to write good unit tests for – if your abstraction is easily testable it’s more likely to be a good abstraction.</p>
<h3>3. Are there special cases or arguments only used by a fraction of callers?</h3>
<p>Take a look at the following example:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getArea(height, width){
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>This is a great function! Its very simple, and obviously can be used to calculate the area of any shape. Here’s a bad example:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getArea(height, width, isTriangle){
  if (isTriangle){
    return (height * width) / 2
  }
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>Special cases are bad news – I’m trying to be too abstract. Instead I should just create two separate functions:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getTriangleArea(height, width){
  return (height * width) / 2
}

function getRectangleArea(height, width){
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>Have any more ideas for good rules of thumb? Let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/wagslane" target="_blank" aria-label="Twitter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>! I’d love to update and improve this article.</p>

    <p>Turing machine programs are sometimes represented as directed graphs. The vertices of the graph are the program’s states and the edges are transitions between states. The program’s print and shift instructions are relegated to being labels for the edges. Here’s an example:</p>

<p><img src="https://nickdrozd.github.io/assets/2021-01-26-spaghetti-code-conjecture/green-graph.png" alt="img"></p>

<p>Suppose you have a Turing machine diagram, but you don’t have access to the print and shift instructions. All you have is the graph of the states and their transitions. I don’t know why you don’t have the prints and shifts, but you don’t. Maybe you’re looking at the diagram on an overhead projection and you forgot your glasses. Maybe the diagram was drawn on a whiteboard and somebody walked past and bumped into it and wiped away the instructions. Maybe you had the program on a deck of punch cards but you dropped them and the cards got out of order and now all you can recover are the state transitions. Way to go, you klutz. Try a rubber band next time.</p>

<p>What can you tell about a program given only its state transitions? Certainly it isn’t possible to figure out exactly what the progam does. There’s no way to tell how the machine will interact with the tape. But the program’s logical structure can be discerned. Look at the example above. States 1 and 2 do some kind of initialization for state 3. States 3, 4 and 5 form a loop. States 5, 6 and 7 form another loop. The 3-4-5 can, based on a decision made at state 5, extend to include 5-6-7 loop.</p>

<p>Why was 6 afraid of 7? Becase 7 ate 9. Neden 4 5 korkuyor? Çünkü 5 6 yedi. The one-two-three cat made it across the river, but the un-deux-trois cat sank.</p>

<p>Busy Beaver programs have state transition graphs too. What do you think they would look like in general? What kinds of properties would you expect a Busy Beaver graph to have?</p>

<p>As far as I know, this question was first posed by Joshua Zelinsky <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4916#comment-1850560">in a blog comment</a>. It seems like an obvious question when you hear it, but I haven’t seen any evidence that anyone had ever thought much about Busy Beaver graphs before that. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.03184.pdf">James Harland</a> pointed out that Busy Beaver graphs can’t be <em>disconnected</em> (that is, that there can’t be two nodes between which there is no undirected path), but didn’t go any further. <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/147554934.pdf">Ludewig, Schult, and Wankmüller</a> compiled an appendix of 100 long-running 5-state programs, each accompanied by a hand-drawn state transition diagram. Look at these nice graphs:</p>

<p><img src="https://nickdrozd.github.io/assets/2021-01-26-spaghetti-code-conjecture/uwe-graphs.png" alt="img"></p>

<p>They went to all the trouble of drawing all those diagrams, but their report doesn’t mention the graphs at all. Why not?<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Zelinsky conjectured that all Busy Beavers graphs are <em>strongly connected</em> (that is, that for any two nodes, there is a directed route from one to the other). Call this the <strong>strongly connected graph conjecture</strong>. <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/bb.pdf">Scott Aaronson</a> made a broader and vaguer proposal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A related intuition, though harder to formalize, is that Busy Beavers shouldn’t be “cleanly factorizable” into main routines and subroutines – but rather, that the way to maximize runtime should be via “spaghetti code,” or a single n-state amorphous mass.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the <strong>Spaghetti Code Conjecture</strong>. On top of spaghetti, all covered with cheese, is the longest-running program of some fixed length. Like Aaronson says, it isn’t a formal statement. It’s a stand-in for a set of formal statements. It implies the strongly connected graph conjecture, for instance, and other statements too. Which statements? That’s a research program. Or maybe it’s a research programme.</p>

<p>I’ll say more about the Spaghetti Code Conjecture, but before that I want to look at an application. And before <em>that</em> I want to say something about the nature of “spaghetti code”.</p>

<p>It’s sometimes defined as code that uses <code>goto</code> statements. But that isn’t right. <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.103.6084&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Donald Knuth</a> uses <code>goto</code> in his programs, and he doesn’t write spaghetti code. “Spaghetti” is a logical property, not a syntactical one. It means that the code’s control flow is <em>convoluted</em> or <em>unduly complex</em>. It’s not enough for the control flow to be just <em>complex</em>, it has to be <em>unduly</em> complex. If the code is modeling something that is complex using control flow that is simple, it’s probably wrong. Spaghetti code has a control flow that is more complex than it needs to be.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, a lot of code that is written by professional programmers is spaghetti. Shocking, I know, but true. Spaghetti code is often not created intentionally. It can result from carelessness, or even a lack of taste. Here are two ways of setting a variable to some conditionally chosen value:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>## ternary expression ##################
</span>
<span>var</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>()</span> <span>if</span> <span>test</span><span>()</span> <span>else</span> <span>that</span><span>()</span>

<span>## if / else ###########################
</span>
<span>if</span> <span>test</span><span>():</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>()</span>
<span>else</span><span>:</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>=</span> <span>that</span><span>()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The ternary expression is obviously the better choice here. It has a simpler control flow. One assign statement, one path. The if-else block has two assign statements, each executed on a separate path. It’s spaghetti-er than the ternary. It’s also much more common. Is that a coincidence? A general lack of taste would explain the correlation. It could explain some other things too.</p>

<p>It really isn’t accurate to describe a Busy Beaver program as “spaghetti”. Spaghetti has a flimsy structure, great for slurping. You wouldn’t want to eat something with the structure of a Busy Beaver program. It would be unpleasant going down and unpleasant coming back up. And make no mistake, it would come back up.</p>

<p>Anyway, on to the application of the Spaghetti Code Conjecture. A program can be converted to a state transition graph by ignoring its print and shift instructions and considering only the states. Now go the other direction. Given an <em>n</em>-state <em>k</em>-color state transition graph, how many concrete programs correspond to it? In other words, how many ways are there to decorate the graph with print and shift instructions? There are <em>nk</em> transitions. Ignoring <a href="https://nickdrozd.github.io/2020/10/04/turing-machine-notation-and-normal-form.html">normalization</a>, each transition gets a left or right shift and one of the <em>k</em> colors. That makes <em>2k</em> decorations per transition, and so <em>2nk<sup>2</sup></em> programs per graph. Is that right? I hope so. That means 40 programs per graph in the ❺② case, and 54 programs per graph in the ❸③ case.</p>

<p>This fact can be applied to Busy Beaver searching. The naive search method generates all <em>n</em>-state <em>k</em>-color programs and then searches them. But the total number of programs gets out of hand fast, growing on the order of <em>O((nk)<sup>nk</sup>)</em>. A better way to do it is to generate the possible graphs first and then decorate them with instructions. The Spaghetti Code Conjecture can then be used at graph-generation time to discard graphs that seem unsuitable. (How many program graphs are strongly connected? I have no idea. That’s a sophisticated calculation, and I don’t know what I’m doing.) Discarding a few graphs means discarding a whole swath of programs. It can’t be overemphasized how many programs there are. Discarding them is like bailing water out of a ship. There is no choice but to get rid of a lot of them, and as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>This isn’t just idle speculation. I used the <em>graph decoration</em> technique along with Zelinsky’s strongly connected graph conjecture to find <a href="https://nickdrozd.github.io/2020/10/09/beeping-busy-beaver-results.html">the reigning ❹② Beeping Busy Beaver champion</a>. The conjecture has predictive power! So as far as <em>I’m</em> concerned, its value has already been proved.</p>

<p>Wait, did somebody say “proved”? Like, the conjecture has been formally proved? No, of course not. I doubt it can be proved at all. It might even be provably unprovable. But it could nevertheless be true. Busy Beaver searchers are interested in establishing lower bounds, not upper bounds. If a conjecture leads to better lower bounds, that’s good enough.</p>

<p>How much wood would a woodchuck chuck? Would a beaver eat spaghetti? Raccoons sure do love rummaging through my trash, I can tell you that.</p>

<p>Here’s an argument that the strongly connected graph conjecture is true. It’s not a real proof, just a suggestive argument. Argument by induction on the number states, with fixed <em>k</em> colors. 0- or 1-state programs are trivial and/or degenerate, so start with the base case of 2 states, <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>. Busy Beaver programs run on the blank tape, so the program starts in transition <code>A0</code>. If it stays in state <code>A</code>, then it will remain on transition <code>A0</code> forever, and is therefore junk. So <code>A0</code> must transition to <code>B</code>. Does <code>B</code> have any connections to <code>A</code>? If it doesn’t, then the program will spend the rest of its execution time in its <em>k</em> <code>B</code> transitions, and won’t be able to use the full <em>2k</em> transitions available. But surely such a program can’t be the ❷ⓚ Busy Beaver. Kinda QED on the base case. Next, the induction step. The <em>n</em>-state Busy Beaver is strongly connected. What about the <em>n+1</em>-state Busy Beaver? Suppose it isn’t strongly connected. For simplicity, suppose also that <em>n+1</em> is the least number of states for a Busy Beaver program whose state graph is not strongly connected. Every Busy Beaver program through <em>n</em> states is strongly connected spaghetti, but then some kind of structure gets introduced at <em>n+1</em>? Why? What kind of structure? Why <em>n+1</em>, and not earlier or later? It seems unlikely. The inductive step is kinda done, and that takes care of the loosey-goosey informal argument.</p>

<p>So we think that Busy Beaver program graphs should be strongly connected. What other properties should they have? I’m now going to enter into the territory of rank speculation and propose a few properties that seem like they should hold. Some caveats:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Busy Beaver programs need to halt, and that means they need to include a halt state (exactly one, in fact). Inclusion of the halt state makes for a lot of exceptions to otherwise general statements. I don’t feel like making that explicit, so just assume that the exception is there. This doesn’t apply to Beeping Busy Beaver programs, because <a href="https://nickdrozd.github.io/2021/01/14/halt-quasihalt-recur.html">they don’t indicate program termination in such a clumsy fashion</a>. In general, <a href="https://oeis.org/A337025">halt-free programs</a> will have a more pleasing graph structure than programs with a halt instruction.</li>
  <li>These conjectures are meant to apply <em>n</em>-state programs where <em>n</em> is “sufficiently large”. This is great for the conjecturer, as it …</li></ol></div></article></div></div></div>

<p><em>“Out of every hundred men, ten shouldn’t be there, eighty are just targets”</em></p>

<p><em>Heraclitus 535 - 475 BC.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>My posts on <a href="https://blog.eutopian.io/winning-systems--security-practitioners-2.-preparation/">Winning Systems for Cyber Security Practitioners</a> are my most popular. In them, I attempt to change your perspective on the relative importance of products and <a href="https://blog.eutopian.io/forget-solving-the-cyber-security-skills-shortage/">skills</a> in securing what’s precious to you. I make the case for using systems <a href="https://blog.eutopian.io/winning-systems--security-practitioners-1.-introduction/">(in the broadest sense of the word)</a> not goals. Systems aren’t new. They pre-date the product-era of today. From infrastructure to code, you can count on them. Products and vendors come and go. Skills are irregular and scarce. It is systems that are eternal and universal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’ve taken my advice, you’ve factored default-deny, responsiveness, robustness, and resilience into your thinking. This post is about minimising your attack surface. In it, I explain what this means and why it may be our best hope for reducing vulnerability in practice. Finally, I’ll tell you what the world might look like if we took this winning system to its ultimate logical conclusion. Before we get there let’s begin at the beginning.</p>

<h4 id="the-problem">The Problem</h4>

<h5 id="1-codebase-size-quality">1: Codebase Size &amp; Quality</h5>

<p>According to the Software Engineering Institute, software developed in the USA has about 6000 defects per million lines of source code (MLOC)<sup id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> for high-level languages like Java and C#. High-quality code has 600 to 1000 defects per MLOC. Code of exceptional quality developed with the highest levels of assurance exhibits defects below 600 per MLOC. Between 1% and 5% of those defects are thought to be security vulnerabilities<sup id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. Let’s apply that research to some well-known codebases and see what the numbers look like.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Software</th>
<th>MLOC</th>
<th>Vulns. (high est.)</th>
<th>Vulns. (low est.)</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>FreeBSD</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>2700</td>
<td>54</td>

<td>9000</td>
<td>180</td>

<tr>
<td>Facebook</td>
<td>65</td>
<td>19500</td>
<td>390</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The low estimates don’t look bad. There’s no chance they apply here. Even the high rate may be too conservative for contemporary Internet-based applications. Most technology companies optimise for the shortest time to market, because they have competition. They optimise for flexibility, because they don’t know what they’re building until they find product/market fit. Security, stability, and ease of maintenance (the conventional measures of software quality) are not high on the list of priorities.</p>

<h5 id="2-tractability-distributedness">2: Tractability &amp; Distributedness</h5>

<p>MLOC is a simplistic measure. Modern Internet applications consist of a mixture of software from a long and complex supply chain. Partly Open Source. Partly licensed. Partly offshore. Partly of unknown origin. Some code recent. Some ancient. Some developed with great care. Some slapdash. Modern web applications draw upon software in the form of services from a dozen places. Your application may be partly distributed even though you think of it as centralised.</p>

<p>Consider this <a href="https://blog.eutopian.io/the-stack/">blog</a>. It has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx">web server</a> and an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD">Operating System</a>. It uses cosmetic client-side javascript. It has an external comment section. Fonts and cookies come from Google. I should say something about SSL and DNS services. Without these, the site wouldn’t function. All this attack surface for some static text that looks much as it would have in the 1980s. Its puny code is distributed and diverse. It doesn’t even offer an application in the conventional sense. The simplest things have a larger attack surface than you think. Some numbers:</p>

<thead>

<th>MLOC</th>
<th>Vulns. (high est.)</th>
<th>Vulns. (low est.)</th>

</tbody>

<blockquote>
<p>For OpenSSL nobody believes 194 CVEs represent anything other than a small fraction of the actual vulnerabilities. OpenSSL is mature and supposedly security-critical. It has a highly exposed codebase. It has a single design-purpose. What do you think the vulnerability rate is like for the average piece of software? Our high estimates don’t look high after all.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="3-informal-methods">3: Informal Methods</h5>

<p>Some vulnerabilities are design weaknesses or logic errors. Not buffer overruns. Not input validation problems. Not statistical errors. Not side-channel attacks. They are precedence bugs, off-by-one bugs, or errant state machine misbehaviour. Not the kind of flaw that static analysis is good at spotting. Not the kind of flaw you can easily patch away.</p>

<h5 id="4-unintended-consequences">4: Unintended Consequences</h5>

<p>I’ve said nothing about deployment practices, configuration, or administration. Even if you aren’t a developer, there’s no shortage of ways you can expose or create vulnerability as a consequence of individual configuration choices. Software has many layers and many settings. Unintended consequences arise from interactions between these settings and layers. Defaults are frequently a poor choice. Even documentation is sometimes misleading in a way that jeopardises security.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As code breadth, depth, diversity, and distributedness increases, so does scope for errors and vulnerability. These four problems are the reason why software is insecure.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="good-news-bad-news-luck-judgement">Good News Bad News, Luck &amp; Judgement</h4>

<p>The news isn’t all bad. Some part of the odds falls in our favour.</p>

<ul>
<li>Not all vulnerabilities are exposed by default.</li>
<li>Not all exposed vulnerabilities are exposed to unprivileged users.</li>
<li>Not all exposed unprivileged user vulnerabilities end in system compromise.</li>
</ul>

<p>Experience tells us we can’t draw comfort from this. There are many winning systems but luck is not one of them.</p>

<ul>
<li>What was hidden from exposure can be inadvertently revealed.</li>
<li>What was inaccessible to unprivileged users can slip within their reach.</li>
<li>What looked like a tiny hole, turns out to be a secret passage into the castle.</li>
</ul>

<p>What about judgement? The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) improves software quality and with it security. However, it provides only a marginal reduction in total vulnerability once we consider the sum of a deepening stack, spiralling dependencies, and increasing distributedness and diversity of code within real applications. If software quality is order and flaws are disorder, disorder is still increasing at a faster rate than order can be imposed. This isn’t an argument against S-SDLC, DevSecOps, Formal Methods, or any other software quality initiative. It’s an observation that these things are not an adequate braking force. We continue to roll downhill towards greater overall vulnerability.</p>

<p>Consider “as a service” providers. They carry their own vulnerable software, which they may improve. They also carry the vulnerable “genes” of all the other components, products, and 3rd party services they build upon. They have no meaningful control over this inheritance and only partial influence over whether those genes are “expressed” in their particular formulation of an architecture or service. Soon software will be everywhere, inside everything. Much of it vulnerable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The winning system is, therefore, the relentless limitation of attack surface. Whether it be by design, development, or deployment. Preferably all three. Don’t wait for software quality to improve. Count on it remaining lousy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="reducing-attack-surface-in-practice">Reducing Attack Surface In Practice</h5>

<p>This series is for practitioners, but it talks of systems. It does so because practices co-evolve with technology and technology becomes obsolete, invalidating practices with it. You can watch this happen in real-time. Professionals, products, and  companies struggle to stay relevant when customers move from traditional physical infrastructure to cloud to serverless.</p>

<p>Winning systems are eternal. They transcend the tech-de-jour. The IT industry hasn’t grasped this. That’s why job descriptions are still packed with vendor and product names. It’s why product companies fail to talk a language that business understands. It’s why I still think a classical Computer Science and Software Engineering background helps. It separates pristine theory from messy, proprietary, and perishable practice.</p>

<p>So let’s start with the pristine theory first before getting dirty with practices:</p>

<ul>
<li>For software which you must expose, expose only a small part.</li>
<li>For that small part:

<ul>
<li>Expose it only to a constrained group of users.</li>
<li>Expose only a necessary subset of its functionality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For that subset:

<ul>
<li>Eliminate complexity, making it as simple as possible.</li>
<li>Apply the winning systems of least-privilege and default-deny.</li>
<li>If a given function can be achieved in a less risky way, take it.</li>
<li>Where complexity is unavoidable, treat that software with suspicion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Remove unused or vestigial elements, they are a liability.</li>
</ul>

<p>The practical extent to which one can limit attack surface is case-specific. It depends upon the level of control you have over the software in question and the environment within which it runs. However, everyone can do something to limit their attack surface, even if your control is limited to that of a network or systems administrator.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>^^^ PLEASE USE POST USING ABOVE LINK FOR MY “ONE-LINE IT JUST WORKS” ^^^</strong><br>
(IGNORE EVERYTHING BELLOW THIS AS IT’S THE ORIGINAL DEVELOPMENT WORK)<br>
===================================================================</p>
<p><strong>Everything from this point down is out of date as of: 3-30-2020</strong></p>
<p>This was my initial “netflix on the raspberry pi 4 development” blog post. Leaving it on here due to the comments, initial work, info for those interested, but I highly recommend using the easy method above (linked).</p>
<p>Last libwidevine extract: 3-29-2020 – v.4.10.1610.6 of libwidevine – EVERYTHING CONFIRMED WORKING</p>
<p><em><br>
Chromium has made substantial changes the way libwidevine (and a few major things around DRM) are loaded/used/etc. They have also made changes to the setting and reading of the user-agent propagation. For some time (~2 months or so) — the combination of this badly broke Netflix. It seems they have undone the lib loading in the last couple of versions, and user @Spartacuss discovered the user-agent fix.</em></p><p><em>The instructions here (as of 3-29-2020) work for: Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Spotify, Pandora, and many others.</em></p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi 4 model with 4GB of RAM is the first cheap hardware that can provide a real “desktop-like” experience when browsing the web/watching Netflix/etc. However, if you have tried to run Netflix on the Pi, you have quickly entered the disgusting mess that exists around DRM, WideVine (Netflix being one example of something that needs it), and Chromium.</p>
<p>After hours and hours of effort, I finally discovered a quick and elegant solution that lets you use the <strong>latest default provided Chromium browser</strong>, without having to recompile anything in order to watch any WideVine/DRM (Netflix, Spotify, etc) content.</p>
<h2>Background and the DRM Problem</h2>
<p>If you are not familiar with this, the short version is that Netflix (and many others, ex: Spotify) use the WideVine “Content Protection System” – aka DRM, and if you want to watch Netflix or something else that uses it, you need to have a WideVine plugin+browse supported integration. Chrome, Firefox, and Safari make it available for x86/amd64 systems, but not for ARM since technically they don’t have ARM builds.</p>
<p>Chromium, the project Chrome is based on, does have an ARM build, but it does not include any DRM support, and technically it does not include widevine support by default (*caveat here, which helps us later)<br>
So long story short, the question becomes “how do you enable DRM/WideVine support in Chromium?”.</p>
<p>It seems there are two main solutions out there: use an old (v51, 55, 56, 60) version of Chromium which has been “patched” with widevine support (kusti8’s version seems to be the most popular one – except since the new Netflix changes, that also does not work), which requires uninstalling the latest Chromium available, installing the old/patched one, and dropping in older widevine plugins; the second option is to use Vivaldi – a proprietary fork of Opera which also has been “sort of patched”, but it still needs a valid libwidevinecdm plugin (see bellow) and it has it’s own issues (and also…it’s Opera…in 2019…who uses Opera?)</p>
<p>After a lot of research and trial and error, I discovered a much more elegant solution – use the extracted ChromeOS (armv7l – yay) binaries and insert them into Chromium + make everything think it’s ChromeOS (user agent)</p>
<h2>Netflix/Hulu/Spotify with the Default Raspberry Pi Chromium Browser</h2>

<p><strong>Enough theory – let’s do this in 2 quick steps!</strong><br>
0.) If you have tried Netflix/etc already, open Chromium and clear your browser history + cookies. Otherwise it will cache the “failed” DRM components.</p>
<p><strong>1.) Download the latest extracted ChromeOS <a href="http://blog.vpetkov.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/libwidevinecdm.so_.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">libwidevine</a> binary and extract it:</strong></p><!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

<p><strong>2.) Completely QUIT all Chromium windows.</strong><br>
Start Chromium with the new Application Menu under “Internet”: <strong>Chromium (Media Edition)</strong><br>
<del datetime="2020-03-30T00:52:10+00:00">Open a new tab, and go to: https://bitmovin.com/demos/drm You should be able to see the movie on the left. </del>(While this still works, it will show “No DRM” unless you set the Chromium user-agent from within the app – which breaks Netflix. BitMoving unfortunately looks for that first. Just go to Netflix/Your media source directly.)<br>
You can now play Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Spotify, Pandora, Disney+, Amazon Prime, and many others!</p>
<p>Please note that If you can see the video on the left, this means the DRM plugin has worked! From this point on, anything that does not work (ex: Netflix sometimes breaks after a browser update) is due to the site specifically filtering User Agents/doing other “tricks”. So for example, if Netflix does not work, Spotify, Pandora, Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO, etc will still work. <del datetime="2020-03-30T00:52:10+00:00">The BitMovin website is the “real” test on wether the DRM plugin has worked.</del>(While still technically true, if your Chromium user-agent is not set from within the app itself, which breaks Netflix, BitMovin will show “No DRM” even though the DRM decryption works)</p>

<p>It seems the Pi’s raw CPU frequency is still not powerful enough for decoding 100% of the time. While 97-98% of the time is good enough, you will get the occasional “screen tearing” (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing), especially in scenes with fast motion.</p>
<p><del datetime="2020-04-07T04:18:34+00:00">Users Otaku, DM (and thanks to Luca for testing/extra info!) have found a solution which was mentioned on https://lb.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=246179 by user Greysvandir.<br>
I had to add a few more things and I created a compressed and slightly automated 😉 version:<br>
# sudo apt install -f compton<br>
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi<br>
$ cd ~/.config &amp;&amp; wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dastorm/Compton-xfce-config/master/compton.conf<br>
$ cp -f /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart<br>
$ echo “@usr/bin/compton –backend glx” &gt;&gt; ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart<br>
$ echo “xrandr –output HDMI-1 –mode 1280×720” &gt;&gt; ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart<br>
The result is no tearing with 1080p@60fps video.<br>
</del></p>
<p><strong>(OPTIONAL) Get libwidevinecdm version</strong><br>
If you want to check your *actual* libwidevinecdm version, the easiest and quickest way is using user VMX’s elegant python solution:</p>

<p>Launching is hard. The product is never polished “enough”. There are always a hundred more tasks to be completed, and in the midst of a pandemic, it can seem impossible to get a product to the finish line.<br></p>
<p>Yet, we persevered.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>We set a deadline of April 30th 2020 for our <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/tara-ai-1-0">v1.0</a>, and were all cylinders go, with dozens of completed sprints and pull requests from our team and 50 other teams in our early alpha. Best case scenario: my co-founder Syed and I expected a hundred other teams to sign up within a few weeks. Instead, post launch, thousands of workspaces were activated. In short, we were completely blown away by the response.<br></p>
<br>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dx44N4Jx3MeU-ccCvlLrdVZC79artXQ-ORaLC_l5q287H8w1bUvHZLHRkORWcbfdPEjk6B5aJhSJDmkv_moWoJ2hQufI-mas3TJrhN5gIXowR4rINJ0nd4oBaingIQ-dmErRs72M" alt=""></figure></div>

<p>Quickly, Tara AI went to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23033387">page 1 of Hacker News</a> and the outpouring of love and support began. We realized how large of a problem we had truly set to solve, and in 8 months, 20,000 of you worked with Tara to deliver:&nbsp;<br></p>
<ul><li>100,000 tasks</li><li>25,000 sprints</li><li>15,000 product requirements and</li><li>7,000 Github connections</li></ul>

<p>We heard from so many of you how you switched from the “clunk” of Jira, the “mess” of Asana, and how a tool that was built by engineers (for engineers) became your team’s “superpower” to develop and release faster.&nbsp;<br></p>

This is a decade-old concept that needs to end, 1- click is all it should take to start and run a sprint, or connect your project management software to source control.<br></p>
<p><strong>Tara will provide visibility and speed </strong>as you move quickly to deliver software. You should be able to zoom in/out within different concepts in your product delivery assembly line, and the tool should get out of your way as you deliver software.<br></p>
<p><strong>Tara should add predictability</strong> to your workflow. Predictably helping your team deliver on their tasks, sprints or pull requests, and providing indicators to do so. Continually delivering on your sprints, helps you deliver on your team’s monthly product milestones, which adds up to delivery on annual business goals for your organizations. In short, predictability in effort completed, and estimating effort, becomes integral to delivering on release timelines.</p>

<p><strong>So what’s next?</strong><br></p>
<p>In 2020, we received over 520 feature requests from a highly active community of power users via Intercom, email and our slack group. And, we saw sprints being created in just over 15 different languages. In 2021, we’re delivering:<br></p>
<p><strong>A smarter Tara.</strong>&nbsp;Developers have to manually change statuses and constantly provide updates to the rest of their team, to move tasks across the development pipeline. We’re building automation that works intuitively with your source control and development workflow, so that your tasks flow from branch creation (TODO) to merged pull requests (DONE). Teams will be able to provide their DOD (definition of done) and automatically move tasks in the hand-off from development to QA, from one engineer to the next.</p>
<p><strong>An improved interface. </strong>We’re making it even easier to search and filter through the platform with smart labels, to help prioritize your work. We’re also working on a new navigation that makes it faster to create tasks, product requirements or sprints, at any level, as your team delivers software from specification to release.<br></p>
<p><strong>Larger teams. </strong>Today, Tara is optimized for workspaces and teams of up to 30 developers. We’ve mindfully crafted the experience for small teams, yet we continue to hear from larger teams that are anxiously waiting to make the switch to Tara. Moving forward, we’re building functionality to support access controls and user management, along with reporting and quarterly/monthly milestone setting. Our mobile experience is also a part of this roadmap.<br></p>
<p><strong>More integrations. </strong>We’ve shipped several updates to our Github integration, alongside a new Gitlab integration. Next up, we’re working on more source control connections, to welcome teams from Bitbucket and other platforms. We’re also releasing our full-fledged Slack app, with reporting functionality and task creation, directly from Slack.</p>

<p>And, there’s more. We have an even larger roster of updates planned for 2021. To deliver on this ambitious roadmap, <a href="https://tara.ai/about/careers/">we’re hiring</a> engineers, designers and scientists looking to change productivity for developers.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>We’re excited to see what you will continue to build with Tara. Here’s to our customers.</p>
<p>Onwards and upwards.</p>

			<p>The station’s atmosphere is maintained at pressure comfortable for the crew members, and a tiny bit of that air leaks over time, requiring routine repressurization from nitrogen tanks delivered on cargo resupply missions. In September 2019, NASA and its international partners first saw indications of a slight increase above the standard cabin air leak rate. The leak has presented no immediate danger to the crew or the space station. The crew isolated sections of the station to monitor pressure changes to find and repair this air leak starting in August 2020.</p>
<p>The Distran Ultra Pro acoustic camera displays the leak location and estimates equivalent pinhole leakage rates and limit of detection in real-time. This Swiss-made technology detects ultrasounds emitted by air flow as it rushes through small holes, seams, and cracks. The acoustic imaging is overlaid on an optical image in real time, offering clear pinpointing of leaks. Ultra Pro records vacuum and jetting ultrasounds emitted by any type of leak (steam, CO2, CH4, H2, etc.) offering a wide range of applications.</p>
<p>Tests have shown that Ultra Pro’s leak detection abilities are not impaired when the frequencies of noise-source energy are sufficiently far from the test frequency. Not all leaks produce ultrasound at the same frequency, and user selection of frequencies from 10-55 kHz is facilitated by an integrated, real-time spectrogram display. The Ultra Pro can potentially locate partially obstructed, hard-to-reach, or hidden leaks, potentially providing a great advantage as the ISS modules are filled with equipment racks, piping, cables, and experiment payloads.</p>
<p>Distran technology has been in use since 2013, mostly in the oil &amp; gas industry, chemical manufacturing, and power plants. This versatile device, which can also pinpoint partial discharges, saves time and gas or electric consumable costs as well as it provides a safe manner to check for leaks from a distance.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>When you develop a Python project, you need to install the project's dependencies. For a long time, tutorials and articles have told you to use a virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies. This way you don't contaminate the working set of other projects, or the global interpreter, to avoid possible version conflicts. We usually have to do these things:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ python3 -m venv venv  
$ <span>.</span> venv/bin/activate   
<span>(</span>venv<span>)</span> $ pip <span>install</span> -r requirements.txt  </code></pre></div>
<p>There are also workflow tools that simplify this process, such as <a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/">Pipenv</a> and <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a>. They create virtual environments for you without perception and then install dependencies into them. They are used by a wide range of users. A virtual environment contains a Python interpreter and has the same directory structure as a normal installation so that it can be used as if it were a standalone Python installation.</p>
<h2 id="the-problems-with-virtual-environments"><a href="#the-problems-with-virtual-environments" aria-label="the problems with virtual environments permalink"></a>The problems with virtual environments</h2>
<p>Virtualenvs help us isolate project dependencies, but things get tricky when it comes to nested venvs: One installs the virtualenv manager(like Pipenv or Poetry) using a venv encapsulated Python, and creates more venvs using the tool which is based on an encapsulated Python. One day a minor release of Python is out and one has to check all those venvs and upgrade them if required before they can safely delete the out-dated Python version.</p>
<p>Another scenario is global tools. There are many tools that are not tied to any specific virtualenv and are supposed to work with each of them. Examples are profiling tools and third-party REPLs. We also wish them to be installed in their own isolated environments. It's impossible to make them work with virtualenv, even if you have activated the virtualenv of the target project you want to work on because the tool is lying in its own virtualenv and it can only see the libraries installed in it. So we have to install the tool for each project.</p>
<p>I've been maintaining the Pipenv project as a collaborator for the past two years and became a member of PyPA in early 2020. I am always thinking if the virtual environment is really a must-to-have for Python projects, just like <code>npm</code>, it doesn't need a cloned <code>node</code> binary, but just a <code>node_modules</code> directory that is unique for each project.</p>
<h2 id="pep-582----python-local-packages-directory"><a href="#pep-582----python-local-packages-directory" aria-label="pep 582    python local packages directory permalink"></a>PEP 582 -- Python local packages directory</h2>
<p>The solution has been existing for a long time. <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/">PEP 582</a> was originated in 2018 and is still a draft proposal till the time I wrote this article, but I found out it is exactly what <code>node_modules</code> are in Python.</p>
<p>Say you have a project with the following structure:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>.
├── __pypackages__
│   └── 3.8
│       └── lib
└── my_script.py</code></pre></div>
<p>As specified in the PEP 582, if you run <code>python3.8 /path/to/my_script.py</code>, <code>__pypackages__/3.8/lib</code> will be added to <code>sys.path</code>, and the libraries inside will become import-able in <code>my_script.py</code>.</p>
<p>Now let's review the two problems I mentioned in the last section and see how they change with the power of PEP 582. For the first problem, the main cause is that the virtual environment is bound to a cloned Python interpreter on which the subsequent library searching based. It takes advantage of Python's existing mechanisms without any other complex changes but makes the entire virtual environment to become unavailable when the Python interpreter is stale. With the local packages directory, you don't have a Python interpreter any more, the library path is directly appended to <code>sys.path</code>, so you can freely move and copy it.</p>
<p>For the second, once again, you just call the tool against the project you want to analyze, and the <code>__pypackages__</code> sitting inside the project will be loaded automatically. This way you only need to keep one copy of the global tool and make it work with multiple projects.</p>

<p>Starting from the PEP, I made <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/">PDM</a>, a new Python package manager and workflow tool that leverages PEP 582 to get rid of virtualenv entirely. It installs dependencies into the local package directory <code>__package__</code> and makes Python interpreters aware of it with <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/#enable-pep-582-globally">a very simple setup</a>. It is not only an implementation of PEP 582 but also the only package manager that supports <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/">PEP 621</a>, a new metadata format based on <code>pyproject.toml</code> which becomes the standard recently. It is foreseen that pip will also gradually support this format. Besides, PDM uses the same dependency resolver as pip and has a full-featured plugin system, allowing for community-contributed plugins to enhance the functionalities.</p>
<p>In PDM, PEP 582 is not mandatory, you can also stick with virtualenv. PDM can detect <strong>existing</strong> venvs but not create new ones.</p>
<p>Another thing that is noteworthy is its dependency resolution mechanism -- it tries to lock versions that are compatible with the <code>requires-python</code> value of the project. Say your project requires Python 2.7 or 3.6 upper and you want to add <code>pytest</code> as a development dependency, in Pipenv(ver. <code>2020.11.15</code>) you have to pin <code>pytest = "&lt;5"</code> manually in <code>Pipfile</code>. And in Poetry(ver. <code>1.1.4</code>) if you run <code>poetry add -D pytest</code> you will get:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>The current project's Python requirement <span>(</span><span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>2.7</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>3.0</span> <span>||</span> <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>3.6</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>4.0</span><span>)</span> is not compatible with some of the required packages Python requirement:
    - pytest requires Python <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>3.6</span>, so it will not be satisfied <span>for</span> Python <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>2.7</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>3.0</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Yes, it tells you to upgrade your Python requires version. However, in PDM, you can lock successfully:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>❯ pdm <span>add</span> -d pytest
Adding packages to dev dependencies: pytest
✔ 🔒 Lock successful
Changes are written to pdm.lock.
Changes are written to pyproject.toml.
Synchronizing working <span>set</span> with lock file: <span>11</span> to add, <span>0</span> to update, <span>0</span> to remove

  ✔ Install atomicwrites <span>1.4</span>.0 successful
  ✔ Install colorama <span>0.4</span>.4 successful
  ✔ Install packaging <span>20.8</span> successful
  ✔ Install more-itertools <span>5.0</span>.0 successful

  ✔ Install pytest <span>4.6</span>.11 successful
  ✔ Install six <span>1.15</span>.0 successful
  ✔ Install wcwidth <span>0.2</span>.5 successful

🎉 All complete<span>!</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, <code>pytest</code> is pinned to <code>4.*</code> that is compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.6+.</p>
<p>For more features and demos, please refer to the <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/">PDM's website</a> and <a href="https://github.com/frostming/pdm">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="some-random-words"><a href="#some-random-words" aria-label="some random words permalink"></a>Some random words</h2>
<p>You may have seen this <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">comic</a> before, there are already so many package managers in Python's world, do we need a new one? No, I think. Gladly we have seen many improvements in the Python packaging ecosystem and the official installer pip, such as <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/">PEP 517</a>/<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/">PEP 518</a>, and the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/announcement-pip-20-2-release/4863">new dependency resolver</a>, more to come in the future. But before the day comes, why not try something different from the traditional, why not make something new that makes at least myself happy. If you think so, PDM should be an option, hopefully.</p></div></div>]]>

<blockquote>“We have a war between two food systems, a traditional diet of real food and ultra-processed food“</blockquote>
<p><br>…<a href="https://twitter.com/RobertLustigMD/status/909205874098397184">tweeted</a>&nbsp;Dr. Robert Lustig, a fellow Professor at UCSF School of Medicine. He’s right. But I&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/DrSepah/status/909240257270267904">replied</a>&nbsp;with the inconvenient truth few are willing to admit: “processed foods have won the war.” That isn’t to say we should be hopeless about the obesity epidemic, but we must soberingly admit our current strategy for curbing it is doomed. But there is another way. When other strategies fail, clinicians sometimes use “<a href="http://www.uncommon-knowledge.co.uk/articles/uncommon-hypnosis/problems-paradoxes.html">paradoxical interventions</a>” where the problem is prescribed as the cure. So this is a radical manifesto about how processed foods have not only caused the obesity epidemic, but can also cure it. To paraphrase Robert Frost:</p>
<blockquote>“The only way out is through.”</blockquote>
<h2><strong>S.A.D.! The Standard American Diet is 2/3 Processed Foods</strong></h2>
<p>Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, Dean of the Tufts School of Nutrition, and colleagues published one of the most eye-opening <a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/3/e009892">studies</a> on the Standard American Diet (or what I humorously like to call “S.A.D.!”). Astonishingly, they showed that only 1/3 of calories come from ‘unprocessed’ (whole) foods anymore. The other 2/3 of calories come 10% from ‘minimally-processed’ foods (like cheese, which one could potentially make in a kitchen) and a staggering 57% from ‘ultra-processed’ foods (like Cheeze-It crackers, which can only be manufactured in a factory).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2500/4432/files/SADgraphic_grande.png?v=1510353917" alt=""></p>
<p>The evidence is clear. By a 2:1 margin, processed foods have dominated whole foods in America like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7TjFqCDrDs&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3B8MFT53a8TtCwx8jXcL1LLw%3D%3D">Mayweather over McGregor</a>. It’s no wonder, processed foods are widely perceived as cheaper, tastier, and more convenient than whole foods. But what people don’t fully realize is that processed foods are actually a dominant technology developed by a multi-trillion dollar food industry, and we are never, ever going back to the pre-industrial way things were. We live in a world of transformative technologies, and in a nation where <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2016/millennials-are-top-smartphone-users.html">98% of Millennials</a> own ‘smart’ phones, our society will clearly never go back to ‘dumb’ phones and pagers. So why do we expect any differently with food?</p>
<h2><strong>What Works for Some, Does Not Work for Most</strong></h2>
<p>For an individual, it is obviously possible to eat 100% whole foods. There are lots of great success stories of people who transformed their entire diets, lost 100 lbs., got off of their medications, etc. But just because “it worked for me”, doesn’t mean it will work for everyone else, because not everyone can “just do what I did.” Any clinician who has actually worked with thousands of patients know that different people have different levels of readiness to change, will require different approaches, and as a result, some will simply do better than others. This is not to downplay the importance of individual responsibility. As I tell my own patients:</p>
<blockquote>“It’s not your fault that you came into my office, but it is your responsibility to walk out better.”</blockquote>
<p><br>Thus, we must balance individual responsibility with acknowledging the data that most don’t succeed on their own. Educating the majority of Americans to only eat whole foods, without addressing how to manage processed foods, is like teaching “abstinence only” sex education, and expecting most people to never engage in sexual activity until marriage. Educational strategies that don’t acknowledge human behavior are hopelessly ineffective. We must acknowledge people indulge, and teach them how to reduce harm when they do so.</p>
<h2><strong>Convenience is King, and is More Sustainable Long-Term.</strong></h2>
<p>The science suggests that though doctors admonish their patients to “eat right and exercise”, this advice alone generally fails to work. In fact, in the placebo/control group (designed to show no effect) of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1351026/">Diabetes Prevention Program clinical trial</a>, patients were counterintuitively instructed to lose 5-10% of their body weight. That’s because researchers knew they <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3135022/figure/F2/">wouldn’t lose any weight</a> anyway! Even the lifestyle (intensive counseling) and metformin (medication) groups, which did lose weight initially and significantly slow the onset of diabetes, eventually regained all the weight lost they lost after a decade.&nbsp;The temporary weight loss was still beneficial (reduced diabetes risk by 34% over 10 years), but would have been more powerful if the weight loss was maintained:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2500/4432/files/metformin_grande.gif?v=1510353972" alt=""></p>
<p>That’s because the law of inertia suggests any clinical treatment for obesity that expects patients to significantly do more work, instead of less, will eventually fail for most people in the long-term. Eating 100% whole foods was only sustainable for a society in a pre-industrial farming era, where the only foods we could eat were the whole foods we hunt, picked, and planted ourselves (that’s the real Omnivore’s Dilemma. Sorry, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/26/magazine/the-modern-huntergatherer.html">Michael Pollan</a>).</p>
<p>But most people no longer have the time, energy, or resources to eat three home-cooked meals per day. Modern households are no longer inter-generational, with fewer grandparents or stay-at-home spouses to bear the responsibility of communal food preparation. Even when TV dinners were introduced in the 1950s, they “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=vP99yWtfovYC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">came as a great relief</a> for housewives burdened with baby-boom offspring.” Convenience is king. But it’s not just because we don’t have time to prepare whole foods, it’s because processed foods are so behaviorally irresistible.</p>
<h2><strong>Obesity is More of a Behavioral than a Biological Problem.</strong></h2>
<p>In the medical community, obesity is considered a symptom of a larger ‘metabolic syndrome’, which shows up externally, as belly fat, but also internally as high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high blood fats. But these are actually symptoms of the root problem. While obesity is a complex, biopsychosocial issue with no easy explanation, the explosion in obesity rates suggest there’s something radical going on. &nbsp;If you look at this CDC time lapse of obesity rates from 1985-2010, most states went from &lt;10% obesity to &gt;30% obesity in the span of only 25 years!</p>
<p><iframe width="744" height="419" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ihSeSToXOw" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So what’s going on? The main driver is that the way we eat has changed dramatically: with people cooking less, eating out more, and relying more on processed, carbohydrate-rich foods that drive insulin resistance. Thus, this data suggests that obesity is more of a behavioral problem than a biological problem. These foods also serve a psychological need. Despite the current opioid crisis, eating is actually America’s favorite narcotic: with <a href="http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2013/eating.aspx">38% of adults</a> reporting “they have overeaten or eaten unhealthy foods in the past month because of stress.”</p>
<h2><strong>Most Ultra-Processed Foods Are ‘Designer Drugs’. We’re Hooked.</strong></h2>
<p>Americans are victims of an ‘obesogenic’ environment that has them hopelessly hooked to the most irresistible designer drug the world has ever known: ultra-processed foods. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Waistland-evolutionary-Weight-Fitness-Crisis-ebook/dp/B000W7KNDK/ref=pd_sim_351_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=0KHF98P7DGDENXB3A6CS">Waistland: A (R)evolutionary View of Our Weight and Fitness Crisis</a>, psychologist Deirdre Barrett argues out that human beings evolved to crave certain stimuli: fats, salts, and sweets, to help us survive and thrive through harsh times. “Big Food” companies exploited these natural cravings by designing processed foods that are far fattier, sweeter, and saltier than anything that normally exists in nature. Thus, processed foods are “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0034N7JI6/">supernormal stimuli</a>” purposefully designed to be addictive, and effectively outcompete whole foods on our tricked taste buds.</p>
<p>Lest you think this is a conspiracy theory — Big Food industry scientists have admitted they use such principles to create addictive foods. A New York Times article, “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/the-extraordinary-science-of-junk-food.html">The Extraordinary Science of Addictive Junk Food</a>”, revealed that companies like Frito-Lay use $30 million R&amp;D budgets to hire research staffs of 500+ scientists to create ‘frankenfoods’ like Cheetos. Cheetos include technologies like “vanishing caloric density,” which make them melt in your mouth so quickly “your brain thinks that there’s no calories in it . . . you can just keep eating it forever.” In light of such irresistible foods, why do we actually expect people to exercise self-control and just “<a href="https://vimeo.com/97370236">stop it</a>”?</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2500/4432/files/cheetos_large.jpg?v=1510354062" alt=""></p>
<h3><strong></strong></h3>
<h2><strong>All Drugs Aren’t Bad. All Processed Foods Aren’t Either.</strong></h2>
<p>In the modern era, we treat addiction as a disease, and often replace addictive and impure street drugs like heroin, with prescription opioid medications like methadone that are purified and better controlled to prevent deadly withdrawals and carefully wean people off. Street drugs and prescription drugs are both “drugs”, but can hardly be equated since the former often takes lives, while the latter can often give it back if properly prescribed and used.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can’t lump all processed foods together as being “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh7l8dx-h8M">bad, m’kay</a>?” Minimally-processed foods like yogurt, butter, and cheese, have been made at home for millennia and also ultra-processed in factories more recently. Studies show dairy consumption is associated with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28318689">lower risk</a> of type 2 diabetes. The devil is always in the details though, and a ball of handmade mozzarella cheese is hardly the same thing as processed cheese slices that have so little actual cheese in them the FDA requires legally labeling them as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processed_cheese#Legal_definitions">cheese product</a>.”</p>
<h2><strong>Intentions Matter: Processing for Health vs. Wealth.</strong></h2>
<p>So we should just avoid ultra-processed foods by avoiding all those chemical sounding ingredients we can’t pronounce, right? While this ‘chemophobia’ can be a helpful shortcut, it’s also not always accurate. If you analyze any whole food like a Kiwi, it’s technically made up of a lot of ‘chemicals’ that naturally exist in nature:</p>
<p>Just because a food is ultra-processed or fortified with added ingredients doesn’t inherently make it unhealthy. While the <a href="http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/exclusive_breastfeeding/en/">World Health Organization</a> educates mothers that breastfeeding for the first 6 months is the “optimal way of feeding infants”, it also acknowledges that infant formula can play an essential or supplementary role in keeping infants alive and healthy when mothers cannot breastfeed regularly. Thus, some ultra-processed foods are optimized for health more than cost or taste, due to tighter government regulations and more selectivity by consumers.</p>

it is secure."><div><p>We explain how CryFS works and why it is secure.</p><p>The description can be a bit technical in some points. If you're rather interested in using CryFS, take a look at the <a>CryFS Tutorial</a>.</p></div></section><section><div><h2>Storing data</h2><div><p><img src="https://www.cryfs.org/_next/static/images/storingdata-6e5ee2b5bc550e4d8be92cbcd80b9011.png" alt="Your files, metadata and directory structure are stored as a set of same-size blocks, encrypted, and stored in the cloud."></p><div><p>The goal of CryFS is not only to keep file contents, but also file sizes, metadata and directory structure confidential.</p><p>To hide file sizes, CryFS splits the content of a file into same-size blocks and encrypts these blocks individually.
A tree structure is used to remember how the blocks belong together to form a file.
This tree structure has very little overhead and itself is also stored using encrypted same-size blocks.
To hide file metadata and directory structure, they are also represented using encrypted same-size blocks.</p><p>Each encrypted block is stored as a file in the base directory, using a random ID as filename.
The base directory can then be set up to be synchronized with a cloud provider like Dropbox.
An attacker with access to the base directory can only see a set of same-size ciphertext blocks and can't see
contents, file sizes, metadata or directory structure of your data.</p><p>The blocks are encrypted using a block cipher chosen by the user. A random encryption key is generated when the filesystem is created.
This key is stored in a configuration file, which is then encrypted using the password chosen by the user.
Since it is encrypted, it can be stored together with the ciphertext blocks in the cloud, which is the default.
If you want to use an insecure (e.g. empty) password or don't trust the scrypt algorithm used for encrypting the configuration file, you can also keep the configuration file locally.</p></div></div></div></section><section><div><h2>Configuration File</h2><p>The base directory also contains a configuration file with the information CryFS needs to decrypt it.
This configuration file is encrypted and integrity-checked using the password chosen by the user, so an attacker cannot read or modify it.</p><p>The information stored in the configuration file includes the following.</p><ul><li><strong>[Cipher]</strong>: The cipher used (e.g. <var>aes-256-gcm</var>)</li><li><strong>[Encryption Key]</strong>: The encryption key used for encrypting blocks</li><li><strong>[Root Block ID]</strong>: The block ID for the block storing the root directory (entry point for the filesystem)</li></ul><div><div><p>The configuration file is encrypted twice, once with <var>aes-256-gcm</var> and once with the cipher chosen by the user.
This way, if the user doesn't trust <var>aes-256-gcm</var> for some reason,
they can choose another cipher and still be secure.
The keys for both encryption layers are generated from the user-chosen password using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt">scrypt</a>.</p><p>In detail, CryFS generates two keys <var>outer_key</var> and <var>inner_key</var> using scrypt and the user password.
It encrypts the configuration file using the user cipher and <var>inner_key</var>.
To the ciphertext, it prepends the name of the user cipher (so it knows how to decrypt it later) and encrypts
the result using <var>aes-256-gcm</var> and <var>outer_key</var>. This way, an attacker cannot see or manipulate which cipher is used.
As a last step, the scrypt configuration parameters are prepended, so CryFS knows how to configure scrypt when
decrypting the filesystem.
When decrypting the configuration file, CryFS first reads the scrypt parameters and regenerates both keys from the user password.
Then, it decrypts the first layer and reads the cipher chosen by the user.
Using this cipher, it decrypts the second layer and reads the configuration values.</p></div><p><img src="https://www.cryfs.org/_next/static/images/configfileencryption-3ae7bd61acfdd365aab16b721dbbcfad.png" alt="Configuration File Encryption Layers"></p></div><p>The integrity of the configuration file depends on <var>aes-256-gcm</var>.
This cipher is a standard cipher and believed to be very secure.
If, however, you don't trust the integrity of <var>aes-256-gcm</var> and want to use another cipher instead,
we recommend adding the <kbd>--cipher xxx</kbd> parameter each time you mount the filesystem.
This way, CryFS can check that the cipher used by the filesystem is the one you actually specified
and you don't have to rely on the <var>aes-256-gcm</var> integrity verification step.</p><p>Alternatively, you can store the configuration file outside of the base directory and not upload it into the cloud.<br>
This is possible using the <kbd>--config</kbd> parameter when calling CryFS.</p></div></section><section><div><h2>Security Analysis</h2><p>The security of CryFS has been proven in a <a href="https://www.cryfs.org/cryfs_mathesis.pdf">master's thesis</a>
and in a <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-61176-1_23">scientific paper published at DBSec 2017</a>

The works also contain a detailed description of the inner workings of CryFS.</p><p>The current version meets all security goals regarding confidentiality of file contents, size, metadata and directory structure.
The integrity goals mentioned in the thesis are also implemented as of version 0.10.0.
The 0.9.x versions protect the encrypted blocks from being modified by an attacker,
since they use an authenticated encryption scheme like <var>aes-256-gcm</var>,
but they don't prevent an attacker from rolling back the filesystem by replacing blocks with an earlier valid version of the same block yet.</p></div></section><section></section> <section></section></div></div>]]>

As it's the NAT or firewall that opens the destination port, this bypasses any browser-based port restrictions.</p><p>This attack takes advantage of arbitrary control of the data portion of some TCP and UDP packets <i>without</i> including HTTP or other headers; the attack performs this new packet injection technique across all major modern (and older) browsers, and is a modernized version to my original <a target="_blank" href="https://samy.pl/natpin/">NAT Pinning technique from 2010</a> (presented at DEFCON 18 + Black Hat 2010). Additionally, new techniques for local IP address discovery are included.</p><p>This attack requires the NAT/firewall to support ALG (Application Level Gateways), which are mandatory for protocols that can use multiple ports (control channel + data channel) such as SIP and H323 (VoIP protocols), FTP, IRC DCC, etc.</p><div>

<li>some browsers (Chrome) only divulge the local IP via WebRTC over HTTPS but some of our attacks require HTTP so we first redirect to the HTTPS version of the attack software to extract the local IP</li>
<li>we then redirect to the HTTP version with the local IP included in the URL if we were able to obtain it to bypass other cross-origin protection mechanisms (the <code>.local</code> mDNS/Bonjour address presented will not be useful for the attack)</li>

</ul></li>
<li>large UDP beacon sent from browser via WebRTC TURN authentication mechanism to non-standard port to attacker's server to force IP fragmentation with TURN <code>username</code> field stuffed

<li>victim NAT sees proper SIP REGISTER packet on SIP port or proper H.323 call forward packet (with no HTTP data), triggering ALG to open any TCP/UDP port defined in packet back to any victim host on the network
<ul>
<li>victim NAT rewrites SIP or H.323 packet, replacing internal IP with public IP, hinting to attacker exploit was successful</li>
<li>(v2) as H.323 call forwarding can direct to any other IP, packet can contain any internal IP of any other host on the victim's network, triggering the NAT to port forward to any system on the network</li>
<li>even if victim NAT normally rewrites source ports, the ALG will still be forced to port forward to the attacker's port of choice as it believes victim machine (or other machine on the network, entirely determined by attacker) opened that port and attacker sees new source port in arriving SIP/H.323 packet </li>
<li><b>attacker can now bypass victim NAT and connect directly back to any port on any machine on the network, exposing previously protected/hidden services and systems</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>to investigate...perhaps by you?</i>
<ul>
  <li>non-malicious usage: this technique essentially gives browsers full TCP and UDP socket capability to communicate to any protocol locally on the system; the connection can be abstracted through a cloud server that connects back but the browser just talks to the cloud server as if it's the socket and makes browsers much more powerful to communicate on non-web-friendly protocols</li>
  <li>if testing in a virtual machine (VM) using shared networking (used to protect a host from attacks by routing it through the host, not letting it directly onto the network), if the packets make it out, the parent host machine is where the ports end up getting opened, not the VM ;)</li>
  <li>IP fragmentation allows full control of all data in the IP data section, meaning full control of the <b>UDP header</b>, including source/dest ports in the overflowed packet...what else could this abuse?</li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="network-address-translation-nat">Network Address Translation (NAT)</h2>

<p>We use NATs (Network Address Translation) for several reasons. The most useful feature of NAT is that it allows a single public IP address to be shared among multiple systems. It does this by creating a local network, providing local IP addresses to all machines that connect, and when one of those systems reaches out to the Internet, it rewrites packets going out to use the public IP so responses come back to the NAT, and vice versa, rewriting destination IP to specific client's IP. </p>

<p>It's the responsibility of the NAT to differentiate connections to the same addresses/ports (google.com:443) from internal hosts as ultimately their outbound port, destination ip and source ip will all be the same. If two different internal peers attempt to connect from the same source port, modern NATs will alter one of the source ports (some networks do this to all TCP/UDP source ports).</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samyk/slipstream/main/img/lan.png" alt="NAT"></p>

<h3 id="connection-tracking">Connection Tracking</h3>

<p>From <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Netfilter">Wikipedia à la Wikiwand</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>One of the important features built on top of the Netfilter 
framework is connection tracking. Connection tracking 
allows the kernel to keep track of all logical network 
connections or sessions, and thereby relate all of the packets
which may make up that connection. NAT relies on this 
information to translate all related packets in the same way, 
and iptables can use this information to act as a stateful 
firewall.</code></pre></div>

<p>If a machine behind your NAT sends a packet out and your router expects the remote host may respond, it keeps track of information, specifically the source and destination ports, source and destination IP addresses, and your internal IP, then returns any packets matching it back to your internal IP.</p>

<p>If another host on your LAN attempts to make the same connection with the same source and destination ports + IPs, your NAT wouldn't be able to discriminate it (the source IPs are different on your LAN but are rewritten to the same public IP on the WAN side), so it alters the source port, but rewrites it when sending back to you.</p>

<h3 id="application-level-gateway">Application Level Gateway</h3>

<p>ALGs allow NAT to track a multi-port protocol like FTP to go out from your system to an FTP server, then track when you request a file to be sent to your internal IP on a specific port, the ALG can rewrite the packet to include your public IP, then forward the FTP's server connection back to you. Had it not rewritten your IP, the FTP server would try to connect back to you on your internal IP (or not try at all if it expects the source IP to be the same as the signaling connection).</p>

<div>
<h3>Release Date:</h3><p>
January 26, 2021
</p><h3>Summary:</h3><p>
A serious heap-based buffer overflow has been discovered in sudo
that is exploitable by any local user. It has been given the name
<em>Baron Samedit</em> by its discoverer. The bug can be leveraged
to elevate privileges to root, even if the user is not listed in
the sudoers file. User authentication is not required to exploit
the bug.
</p><h3>Sudo versions affected:</h3><p>
Sudo versions 1.8.2 through 1.8.31p2 and 1.9.0 through 1.9.5p1 are
affected.
</p><h3>CVE ID:</h3><p>
This vulnerability has been assigned <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156" onclick="getOutboundLink('http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156');">CVE-2021-3156</a>
in the <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/" onclick="getOutboundLink('http://cve.mitre.org/');">Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures</a> database.
</p><h3>Details:</h3><p>
When sudo runs a command in <em>shell</em> mode, either via the
<strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-i</strong> command line option, it
escapes special characters in the command's arguments with a backslash.
The sudoers policy plugin will then remove the escape characters from
the arguments before evaluating the sudoers policy (which doesn't
expect the escape characters) if the command is being run in shell
mode.
</p><p>
A bug in the code that removes the escape characters will read
beyond the last character of a string if it ends with an unescaped
backslash character. Under normal circumstances, this bug would
be harmless since sudo has escaped all the backslashes in the
command's arguments. However, due to a different bug, this time
in the command line parsing code, it is possible to run <tt>sudoedit</tt>
with either the <strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-i</strong> options,
setting a flag that indicates shell mode is enabled. Because a
command is not actually being run, sudo does <strong>not</strong>
escape special characters. Finally, the code that decides whether
to remove the escape characters did not check whether a command is
actually being run, just that the shell flag is set. This inconsistency
is what makes the bug exploitable.
</p><p>
To test whether your version of sudo is vulnerable, the following
command can be used:
</p><pre>sudoedit -s '\' `perl -e 'print "A" x 65536'`
</pre><p>
If you receive a usage or error message, sudo is not vulnerable.
If the result is a <strong>Segmentation fault</strong>, sudo is
vulnerable.
</p><p>

</p><h3>Impact:</h3><p>
A local user may be able to exploit sudo to elevate privileges to
root as long as the sudoers file (usually /etc/sudoers) is present.
</p><h3>Workaround:</h3><p>
None. Sudo version 1.9.5p2 or a patched vendor-supported version
must be installed.
</p><h3>Fix:</h3><p>
The bug is fixed in sudo 1.9.5p2.
</p><h3>Credit:</h3><p>
Thanks to the Qualys Security Advisory team for their detailed bug
report and explanation of its implications.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Fear and panic could destroy the city as much as plague itself. Many of the doctors fled, along with the rich and powerful; quacks preyed on the poor with their neverfail miracle drugs. Neighbours informed against each other. People lied to each other – and to themselves. Worse – there were stories of infected people deliberately concealing their telltale ‘tokens’ and going out into the streets trying to infect others.</p><p>-Daniel Defoe, <em>A Journal of the Plague Year</em> (1722)</p></blockquote><h5>Zeynep Tüfekçi is a force of nature whose intellectual range encompasses everything from academic sociology to the impact of social media on society to (more recently) the COVID mask and lockdown debates. Her book <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3hibL21">Twitter and Tear Gas</a></em> is a now-classic study of Internet-fueled protest, and she continues to write prolifically for <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/zeynep-tufekci">The New York Times</a> </em> and <em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/zeynep-tufekci/">The Atlantic</a>. </em>In our lengthy interview—I completely ignored Substack warnings about email length—I unveil the jocular coinage ‘zeynepping’ to describe this unique blend of contrarian and wide-ranging embroilment in the burning issues of the day. She and I have had a year-long DM thread where we agree on basically nothing, except perhaps that McLuhan was right about the fundamentally oral dynamics of modern digital media (which we only mention in passing here, because of course we spent most of our time bickering). She agreed to publicize some of our disagreement in the longest <em>Pull Request</em> interview yet. Tüfekçi also recently started <a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/">her own Substack </a><em><a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/">Insight</a></em>.</h5><p><strong>From what you’ve told me, you started your career as a programmer but then you ended up doing a master's degree and PhD. But your claim to fame was the book on Twitter and the Middle East and its various convulsions, is that right?</strong></p><p>My first claim to fame was when Facebook started. It was just seen as a little college thing, and I started writing that it would scramble our understanding of privacy. It was just collapsing a lot of geographic boundaries, and since I was a college teacher, I could see it in the students’ experience; their mental model of what Facebook was and what it actually did to their experience of space and time. I remember one incident: I used to teach intro to sociology and it's a big lecture class, because that's how those things work. So I would assign little group assignments to break up the lecture. What if you were born a different gender? Or what if you were in a different family? Just very simple, simple stuff for students. And they got a passing grade so long as they turned in something. </p><p>So my TA at one point notices that a bunch of them have the same handwriting. Why on earth are they cheating, what is going on? So I called the group into my office, and they say: <em>What a coincidence we all have the same handwriting!</em> And I ask: <em>Do you know each other?</em> <em>No, we don't know each other</em>, they say. And I did something that I don't ever do: I looked them up on Facebook. And of course, they were all friends with each other, so I just showed them Facebook and I said: <em>Look, you're lying to me, you're all friends with each other</em>. They almost fainted in my office because the idea that their friendship could be documented and be visible to the outside world and that Facebook would be a vehicle for this was a completely alien and incomprehensible thing to these kids.</p><p>The most interesting thing to me was how could they not imagine the obvious thing that this is going to scramble their visibility and ruin their denial. They just had no idea. So I started doing some studies…</p><p><strong>What year was this?</strong></p><p>This was before the Arab Spring, I think my first studies where 2007 or 2008-ish?</p><p>I started saying stuff like: <em>Facebook, they're going to scramble privacy, they are changing how we understand primary and secondary social contacts and their visibility</em>. I started arguing that in some ways—and this is something you and I talk about a lot—this is taking people back to a more intrinsically human way of living, in which you don't lose contact with people. This idea that you've graduated from middle school, and then high school, and then go to a different city and never see those people again, that's kind of a weird 20th-century blip: that's not how humans have mostly lived. But at a scale that is not the same as your village or hunter-gatherer experience. It's got a little bit of this, a little bit of that, and it's going to scramble everything. I kept saying this is going to change the fabric of society, these tools are not these things that just sit outside of society. </p><p>And when the Arab Spring hit, then all of a sudden, because I’m from the Middle East, all of a sudden, people were like: <em>Oh, wait, there was somebody talking about this</em>, and everybody wanted an explanation. That’s when I started being able to do my current work as until then universities would hire me because I could do stats and math. The rest has been a blur.</p><p><strong>I recall first reading your work in the wake of the Arab Spring. The Western vibe at the time was definitely: </strong><em><strong>Isn't this just great and amazing?</strong></em><strong> </strong><em><strong>Twitter is central to this entire social turmoil</strong></em><strong>! Though in retrospect, it might not have had the centrality that Westerners imagined, in terms of the bigger picture…</strong></p><p>But it actually was really important. What's really funny is that a lot of these people are also my friends and people I had known because of the Middle Eastern democracy and dissident crowds. They got so sick of Western journalists asking them about Twitter and Facebook every day, they would just lie, and say: <em>It had nothing to do with any saying. Stop this bullshit. You know, we don't really use those tools</em>.</p><p>They would literally say that, and then they would be on the backchannel saying:<em> Wait, I think the Twitter trending algorithm changed,</em> because they were disassembling it, and they thought about it a lot. But they got so sick of the navel gazing about it because the West could only relate to them as Twitter users. So I wouldn't say it didn't play a key role: I think it played a major role in the upheaval. But it got framed in the West as a stupid question. You know, <em>was it Twitter or was it the people?</em> I felt like stabbing my eyes out when people ask those kinds of questions, so that's when I start writing about it.</p><h4>We have the same narrative about social media in the West now: When it's destabilizing to the people that the chattering classes don't like, it's great. And when it's destabilizing to the chattering classes, then it's terrible: we don't do <em>that</em> to <em>them.</em></h4><p><strong>Right. So the two claims are: This Twitter/Facebook thing is absolutely central. Again, the only way we can relate to these people is via their Twitter usage, otherwise, the local politics are not of vital interest from the Western perspective. And then secondly, that this was all a magnificent thing.</strong></p><p><strong>But as soon as those same disruptions visit the West in the form of Trump, Brexit, the </strong><em><strong>gilets jaunes</strong></em><strong>, etc. Suddenly: </strong><em><strong>Have we questioned whether overthrowing the state of affairs is actually such a great thing??</strong></em><strong> It's interesting to see the contrast between that sort of narrative and the one in 2016.</strong></p><p>We have the same narrative about social media in the West now: When it's destabilizing the people that the chattering classes don't like, it's great. And when it's destabilizing the chattering classes, then it's terrible: we don't do <em>that</em> to <em>them.</em></p><p>When Obama won in 2012, there were I don't know how many articles talking about how great his use of technology and data was. Which is why I started saying: <em>wait, wait, it's not about your candidate, this might not be that great, and there are all these problems</em>. Interestingly, when I started saying that—<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/opinion/beware-the-big-data-campaign.html">I wrote that </a><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/opinion/beware-the-big-data-campaign.html">Times </a></em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/opinion/beware-the-big-data-campaign.html">op-ed</a>, which caused so much grief for me—I heard from so many tech people, from Obama people and big data people and Silicon Valley people, who told me that these tools were necessarily going to only be used by smart people, which were of course them, right? I mean, the whole tech world was completely convinced that the other side, so to speak, would never be smart like them. Really high level people in both the Obama administration and in Silicon Valley just thought: <em>you know, this is ours, this will always be ours, and it will always do our bidding.</em> And of course, anybody who knows history is jumping up and down saying <em>it doesn't do your bidding like that!</em> It's not your little pony that's gonna just destabilize things you happen to dislike at the moment and leave you alone. So here we are.</p><h4>I heard from so many tech people, from Obama people and big data people and Silicon Valley people, who told me that these tools were necessarily going to only be used by smart people, which were of course them, right?

Really high level people in both the Obama administration and in Silicon Valley just thought: <em>you know, this is ours, this will always be ours, and it will always do our bidding.</em></h4><p><strong>You and I both have the same hang ups, because we've had these conversations before, such as the conflict between literacy and orality, the weird warping of geography that social media causes, which to me is one of the biggest things I can't get my head around. </strong></p><p><strong>But just before we leave the topic of the Middle East: One thing <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/the-prophet-of-the-revolt">I asked Martin Gurri about</a> is how is it that a lot of these movements, unlike previous revolutionary movements, didn't quite congeal into any sort of lasting institutional change. The classic example is Occupy Wall Street and to a lesser extent the </strong><em><strong>Gilets Jaunes</strong></em><strong> which haven't really done anything in the political space. Arguably the only counter example is Spain with Podemos…</strong></p><p>In Spain, the group just broke off. They just said, we're gonna form a political party. And that's it. </p><p>If you skimmed my book, my theory there is that these movements look like past movements, in that they have these big massive street marches. But you're looking at something different, right? So if you look at a past big march, …</p></div></div>

                    <p>250+ Developers, SREs, DevOps, Architects and Product Managers have spoken: they struggle with releasing microservices into production. It remains a costly, manual, error-prone and nail-biting task for software teams. In our report we dive into challenges, trends and opportunities for improvement when it comes to releasing and validating software in production. </p><p>The survey spotlights the stark challenges SMBs and enterprises are facing as they pursue their cloud, Kubernetes and microservices journey. The need for release automation increases as systems become more complex (dependencies, highly distributed, different release frequencies) and the pressure from the business to release software faster (and more frequently) is higher than ever.</p><h3 id="kubernetes-and-microservices-have-become-mainstream">Kubernetes and Microservices Have Become Mainstream</h3><p>72% of participants say that they are using Kubernetes in production today and 16% says that they are evaluating or planning to use Kubernetes. Microservices are even more popular. 81% of participants say that they are using microservices in production today and 14% says they have plans to use microservices.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-26-at-17.01.14.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-26-at-17.01.14.png 600w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-26-at-17.01.14.png 1000w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-26-at-17.01.14.png 1001w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://vamp.io/state-of-cloud-native-release-orchestration-2021"><strong>Download the full report State of Cloud-Native Release Orchestration here.</strong></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="majority-is-still-using-high-risk-release-strategies">Majority Is Still Using High-Risk Release Strategies</h3><p>Releasing in production is the process of taking running code and making it “live” and accessible to users, in a predictable and repeatable way. It's about paying particular attention to ensure that releasing a new version doesn’t result in a worse experience for your users. 86% of participants are still using high-risk release strategies such as rolling update, blue-green and big-bang releases. There is a strong lack of canary releasing capabilities with only 9% of participants using this low-risk release strategy. Canary releasing limits the number of users exposed to a bad release (known as limiting the blast radius) by gradually rolling out a new version of a service to a small, representative subgroup of <em><em>real</em></em> user traffic before rolling it out to the entire user base.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/release-strategy-image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/release-strategy-image.png 600w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/release-strategy-image.png 723w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="release-validation-and-rollbacks-remain-a-manual-time-consuming-task">Release Validation and Rollbacks Remain A Manual, Time-Consuming Task</h3><p>Release validation is the process of making sure that released software that’s running in production is meeting the requirements in terms of performance, quality, customer experience and business KPIs. On average it takes 2.2 hours with 4 people engaged during the release validation process.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/image-blog.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-blog.png 600w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/image-blog.png 723w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Rollbacks are a critical part of your release strategy. When implemented right, it creates a safety net to protect your software teams and minimize the impact on the customer experience when issues are starting to occur. 53% of rollbacks are done manually with an average time to rollback of 45 minutes.</p><h3 id="dependency-management-is-the-biggest-challenge-when-it-comes-to-releasing-microservices">Dependency Management Is The Biggest Challenge When It Comes To Releasing Microservices</h3><p>The report revealed that dependency management is the biggest challenge when it comes to releasing microservices in production. Twenty percent of respondents struggle with dependency management, 14% struggle with internal processes and communication, and 10% find validating changing and testing microservices a challenge.</p><h3 id="the-state-of-cloud-native-release-orchestration-2021">The State of Cloud-Native Release Orchestration 2021</h3><p>This blog only scratches the surface of The State of Cloud-Native Release Orchestration, which dives into further topics including release metrics, business drivers to go Cloud-Native, most used monitoring tools and where companies are focussing on when it comes to improvements across the software delivery process in 2021. <a href="https://vamp.io/state-of-cloud-native-release-orchestration-2021">Download the full research report for free</a> and share with interested colleagues.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/Group-70-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Group-70-1.png 600w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Group-70-1.png 1000w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/Group-70-1.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://vamp.io/state-of-cloud-native-release-orchestration-2021"><strong>Download the full research report for free here.</strong></a></figcaption></figure>

		<p>It should come as no surprise that we here at Plex are media lovers. Consummate curators of all that streamy goodness. Voracious imbibers at the fount of all content. Okay, gross, but you get the point. Anyway, every so often an armchair Reddit philosopher comes forth to question some basic truths: “What exactly is the nature of ‘Media’?” they ask. And “How can Plex help us media lovers more fully consummate our curationship?” Okay, sorry, gross again. But it’s a fair question, and one that deserves a little more attention.</p>
<p>Not to date ourselves, but quite a few of us are products of the ‘80s and ‘90s. And when we think about the media that shaped our childhoods and young adult lives, there was one thing that defined us and made it clear that even though we were weird, at the very least we weren’t weird alone. That’s right: <em>stamp collections!</em></p>
<p>Oh wait. We meant VIDEO GAMES.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SYepu_5oSOc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>In the beginning…</h3>
<p>The genesis of Plex saw us casting a disdainful eye over shelves of CDs, DVDs, and random files strewn over hard drives; we knew there had to be a better way to centrally organize and curate our media collections. A safe haven free from scratches and <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bewaring-of-the-green/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">green markers</a>. A place where we could Marie Kondo until every last poster and background was perfect, and then explore and play from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>But there was one category left on that media shelf, gathering dust. It was the old plastic cartridges for our beloved gaming consoles of yore. After all, in the years since our youth, fellow curators have managed to amass rich archives of gorgeous metadata for games, and the retro gaming community truly does run deep. It’s a fantastic movement, and after some soul searching and spiritual walkabouts, the answer arrived: this media belongs inside Plex!</p>
<p>We’ve actually kicked the idea around for years, and given that over the last year we’ve been looking for new ways to entertain and distract ourselves, we decided to finally make it happen. And we gotta say, the results are super cool! It’s so fun to see a collection of ROMs rendered as a Plex library with all the power of filtering, searching, and beautiful details pages, but of course that’s only half the picture…</p>

<h3>Let there be light!</h3>
<p>Video and audio streaming have always been our specialty. We’re blessed with some amazing engineers (among the best in the world!) working on this, and in general we’ve been laser focused on making that experience better.</p>
<p>However, over time we’ve seen some truly impressive developments in interactive game streaming tech. Please allow us to introduce our new partner <a href="https://parsec.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parsec</a>: With their underlying low-latency streaming technology, it was suddenly possible to offer <em>fully playable</em> game libraries within Plex.</p>
<h3>Let the library teem with games</h3>




<p>We’ve also partnered with the most hallowed name in retro games: Atari. With them on board as a partner we’re able to fully license a catalog of classic titles right out of the box. We’re talking Centipede. We’re talking Lunar Lander. We’re talking Motor Psycho!</p>

<p>On account of these partnerships and the licensing involved, Plex Arcade will be a separate subscription for <span data-pp-price-feature="arcade"></span> per month if you have a Plex Pass (and <span data-pp-price-feature="arcade"></span> per month if you haven’t made the leap to Plex Pass yet). Don’t know if you’ll like it? <a href="https://www.plex.tv/arcade/checkout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Try it free for 7 days</strong></a> (that’s a whole week among friends), no strings attached, and let us know what you think.</p>
<h3>Be fruitful</h3>
<p>Look. This effort is real, but if we’re honest it was conceived by a few passionate Plex Labs rats over scorpion bowls at <a href="https://www.mamasfishhouse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mama’s</a>. For now, we’ve convinced the powers-that-be to let us run with it, but we know it’s far from done and we see it as a kind of internal Kickstarter-type project.

<p>There are a few limitations you should be aware of: For now, the server only works on Windows and macOS (sorry, Parsec doesn’t offer their libraries on Linux or other platforms currently, meaning it is not available for servers running on Linux, NAS devices, or NVIDIA SHIELD); and gameplay is restricted to Android (mobile and TV), iOS, tvOS, and the Chrome web browser.</p>
<p>To get started, grab the latest Plex Media Server, and create a new Games library, just like you would for any of your existing media types. We’re working on relaxing these limitations, but for now they’re real.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><a href="https://samy.pl/slipstream/">NAT Slipstreaming</a> allows an attacker to remotely access any TCP/UDP service bound to <b>any system</b> behind a victim's NAT, bypassing the victim's NAT/firewall (remote arbitrary firewall pinhole control), just by the victim visiting a website.</p><p><em>animation generated with my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/samyk/drawio">fork</a> of <a target="_blank" href="https://draw.io/">draw.io</a>, allowing exportable edge context flow &amp; control in animations</em></p><p>NAT Slipstreaming exploits the user's browser in conjunction with the Application Level Gateway (ALG) connection tracking mechanism built into NATs, routers, and firewalls by chaining internal IP extraction via timing attack or WebRTC, automated remote MTU and IP fragmentation discovery, TCP packet size massaging, TURN authentication misuse, precise packet boundary control, and protocol confusion through browser abuse. As it's the NAT or firewall that opens the destination port, this bypasses any browser-based port restrictions.</p><p>This attack takes advantage of arbitrary control of the data portion of some TCP and UDP packets <i>without</i> including HTTP or other headers; the attack performs this new packet injection technique across all major modern (and older) browsers, and is a modernized version to my original <a target="_blank" href="https://samy.pl/natpin/">NAT Pinning technique from 2010</a> (presented at DEFCON 18 + Black Hat 2010). Additionally, new techniques for local IP address discovery are included.</p><p>This attack requires the NAT/firewall to support ALG (Application Level Gateways), which are mandatory for protocols that can use multiple ports (control channel + data channel) such as SIP and H323 (VoIP protocols), FTP, IRC DCC, etc.</p><div>
  <li>victim visits malicious site (or site with malicious advertisement)<!-- eg <a target=_blank href="https://samy.pl/slipstream/server">https://samy.pl/slipstream/server</a>--></li>
<li>internal IP of victim first must be extracted by browser and sent to server

<ul>
<li>internal IP attempted to be extracted via <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/">WebRTC</a> data channel over https</li>
<ul>
<li>some browsers (Chrome) only divulge the local IP via WebRTC over HTTPS but some of our attacks require HTTP so we first redirect to the HTTPS version of the attack software to extract the local IP</li>
<li>we then redirect to the HTTP version with the local IP included in the URL if we were able to obtain it to bypass other cross-origin protection mechanisms (the <code>.local</code> mDNS/Bonjour address presented will not be useful for the attack)</li>
</ul>
<li>if internal IP not divulged by WebRTC (Safari) or no WebRTC (&lt;= IE11), <strong>web-based TCP timing attack performed</strong>

<ul>
<li>hidden <code>img</code> tags to all common gateways (eg <code>192.168.0.1</code>) are loaded in background</li>
<li><code>onerror/onsuccess</code> events attached to <code>img</code> tags</li>
<li>if any TCP RST (onerror) returned by gateway, or SYN + HTTP response (onsuccess), within a few seconds (before TCP timeout triggers onerror), we've detected valid subnet</li>
<li>re-perform timing attack across all IPs on detected subnets (/24), measuring time to onerror/onsuccess firing</li>
<li>fastest response is likely internal IP, though all responses are considered victim internal IP candidates and attacked</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>large TCP beacon sent via hidden form and automatic HTTP POST to attacker "HTTP server" bound to a non-standard port to force TCP segmentation and maximum MTU size discovery of the victim's IP stack
<ul>
<li>attacker TCP server sends <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#section-3.1">Maximum Segment Size</a> TCP Option to massage victim outbound packet sizes (<a target="_blank" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#section-3.1">RFC 793 x3.1</a>), allowing control of how large browser TCP packets will be</li>
</ul></li>
<li>large UDP beacon sent from browser via WebRTC TURN authentication mechanism to non-standard port to attacker's server to force IP fragmentation with TURN <code>username</code> field stuffed
<ul>
<li>we perform a similar attack as our TCP segmentation, but over UDP as IP fragmentation will occur and provide different values than TCP segmentation</li>
<li>victim MTU size, IP header size, IP packet size, TCP header size, TCP segment sizes detected by server and sent back to victim's browser, used later for packet stuffing</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(v1) "SIP packet" in new hidden form generated, containing internal IP to trigger Application Level Gateway connection tracking
<ul>
<li>"HTTP POST" to server on TCP port 5060 (SIP port) initiated, avoiding <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/samyk/chromium/blob/2d57e5b8afc6d01b344a8d95d3470d46b35845c5/net/base/port_util.cc#L20-L90">restricted browser ports</a></li>
<li>POST data is "stuffed" to exact TCP segment size / packet boundary, then “SIP packet” appended and posted via web form</li>
<li><b>victim IP stack breaks the POST into multiple TCP packets, leaving the "SIP packet" (as part of POST data) in its own TCP packet without any accompanying HTTP headers</b></li>
<li>if browser alters size of multipart/form boundary (Firefox) or packet size changes for any other reason, size change is communicated back to client and client auto-resends with new size</li>
<li>when opening UDP port, SIP packet is sent over TURN protocol inside specially crafted <code>username</code> field forcing IP fragmentation and precise boundary control</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(v2) "H.323 packet" using TCP-based STUN (bypassing patches for v1 and browser port restrictions) connection generated, containing internal IP to trigger Application Level Gateway connection tracking, but forcing a redirect to <strong>any other host on the network</strong> in a "call forwarding" packet
<ul>
<li>"H.323 call forward" to server on TCP port 1720 (H.323 port) initiated, avoiding <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/samyk/chromium/blob/2d57e5b8afc6d01b344a8d95d3470d46b35845c5/net/base/port_util.cc#L20-L90">restricted browser ports</a>, despite the port being blocked -- port evasion performed by using WebRTC STUN feature which does not respect the restricted port list</li>
<li><code>username</code> field is "stuffed" to exact TCP segment size / packet boundary, then “H.323 packet” appended and posted via web form</li>
<li><b>victim IP stack breaks the POST into multiple TCP packets, leaving the "H.323 packet" (as part of STUN data) in its own TCP packet without any accompanying HTTP headers</b></li>
<li>if browser alters size of multipart/form boundary (Firefox) or packet size changes for any other reason, size change is communicated back to client and client auto-resends with new size</li>
</ul></li>
<li>victim NAT sees proper SIP REGISTER packet on SIP port or proper H.323 call forward packet (with no HTTP data), triggering ALG to open any TCP/UDP port defined in packet back to any victim host on the network
<ul>
<li>victim NAT rewrites SIP or H.323 packet, replacing internal IP with public IP, hinting to attacker exploit was successful</li>
<li>(v2) as H.323 call forwarding can direct to any other IP, packet can contain any internal IP of any other host on the victim's network, triggering the NAT to port forward to any system on the network</li>
<li>even if victim NAT normally rewrites source ports, the ALG will still be forced to port forward to the attacker's port of choice as it believes victim machine (or other machine on the network, entirely determined by attacker) opened that port and attacker sees new source port in arriving SIP/H.323 packet </li>
<li><b>attacker can now bypass victim NAT and connect directly back to any port on any machine on the network, exposing previously protected/hidden services and systems</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>to investigate...perhaps by you?</i>
<ul>
  <li>non-malicious usage: this technique essentially gives browsers full TCP and UDP socket capability to communicate to any protocol locally on the system; the connection can be abstracted through a cloud server that connects back but the browser just talks to the cloud server as if it's the socket and makes browsers much more powerful to communicate on non-web-friendly protocols</li>
  <li>if testing in a virtual machine (VM) using shared networking (used to protect a host from attacks by routing it through the host, not letting it directly onto the network), if the packets make it out, the parent host machine is where the ports end up getting opened, not the VM ;)</li>
  <li>IP fragmentation allows full control of all data in the IP data section, meaning full control of the <b>UDP header</b>, including source/dest ports in the overflowed packet...what else could this abuse?</li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="network-address-translation-nat">Network Address Translation (NAT)</h2>

<p>We use NATs (Network Address Translation) for several reasons. The most useful feature of NAT is that it allows a single public IP address to be shared among multiple systems. It does this by creating a local network, providing local IP addresses to all machines that connect, and when one of those systems reaches out to the Internet, it rewrites packets going out to use the public IP so responses come back to the NAT, and vice versa, rewriting destination IP to specific client's IP. </p>

<p>It's the responsibility of the NAT to differentiate connections to the same addresses/ports (google.com:443) from internal hosts as ultimately their outbound port, destination ip and source ip will all be the same. If two different internal peers attempt to connect from the same source port, modern NATs will alter one of the source ports (some networks do this to all TCP/UDP source ports).</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samyk/slipstream/main/img/lan.png" alt="NAT"></p>

<h3 id="connection-tracking">Connection Tracking</h3>

<p>From <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Netfilter">Wikipedia à la Wikiwand</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>One of the important features built on top of the Netfilter 
framework is connection tracking. Connection tracking 
allows the kernel to keep track of all logical network 
connections or sessions, and thereby relate all of the packets
which may make up that connection. NAT relies on this 
information to translate all related packets in the same way, 
and iptables can use this information to act as a stateful 
firewall.</code></pre></div>

<p>If a machine behind your NAT sends a packet out and your router expects the remote host may respond, it keeps track of information, specifically the source and destination ports, source and destination IP addresses, and your internal IP, then returns any packets matching it back to your internal IP.</p>

<p>If another host on your LAN attempts to make the same connection with the same source and destination ports + IPs, your NAT wouldn't be able to discriminate it (the source IPs are different on your LAN but are rewritten to the same public IP on the WAN side), so it alters the source port, but rewrites it when sending back to you.</p>

<h3 id="application-level-gateway">Application Level Gateway</h3>

<p>ALGs allow NAT to track a multi-port protocol like FTP to go out from your system to an FTP server, then track when you request a file to be sent to your internal IP on a specific port, the ALG can rewrite the packet to include your public IP, then forward the FTP's server connection back to you. Had it not rewritten your IP, the FTP server would try to connect back to you on your internal IP (or not try at all if it expects the source IP to be the same as the signaling connection).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>New research gives patients with <span>PTSD</span> the power to restore their own patterns of brain activity</p><div>
    <div>
          <div property="content:encoded"><p><strong>LHSC: University Hospital&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In a new study at Lawson Health Research Institute (Lawson) and the University of Geneva, researchers showed that a technique called brain training can be used to restore patterns of brain activity and reduce symptoms of hyperarousal in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (<span>PTSD</span>).</p>
<p>Individuals with <span>PTSD</span> often experience more random patterns of brain activity. A leading symptom of <span>PTSD</span> is hyperarousal, which is associated with defensive responses to stress or triggers. A technique to restore patterns of brain activity to a more balanced order and reduce hyperarousal therefore holds promise as a potential treatment.</p>
<p>With the brain training technique, also called neurofeedback, patients exercise their own brain activity through a circular neurofeedback loop, which acts as a mirror to display brain activity. This is done through a brain-computer interface that records brain signals through sensors on the scalp. Since brain activity is displayed on screen, users can complete brain training exercises in ways similar to a gym workout.</p>
<p>In this study, led by Lawson’s Dr. Ruth Lanius, the goal was for patients with <span>PTSD</span> to reduce the intensity of the brain’s dominant brain wave - the alpha rhythm. Patients used neurofeedback to visualize their brain activity as they played a simple video training game. The 30-minute game consisted of a space ship displayed on a starry background. When patients were successful in reducing their alpha rhythm, the space ship moved forward.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>“Patients reported reducing the dominant brain wave by concentrating their attention towards the visuals on screen. This seemed to propel the spaceship forward,” said Dr. Ruth Lanius, a scientist at Lawson and a psychiatrist at London Health Sciences Centre. “This is consistent with prior research that suggests the alpha rhythm is reduced with increased processing of attention.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The researchers were surprised to find the reduction in alpha rhythm resulted in lasting changes. After the initial reduction, the alpha rhythm rebounded, or increased, to levels matching those found in healthy individuals. Patterns of brain activity were restored to a more proportional balance that is associated with healthy brain function.</p>
<p>Following&nbsp;these sessions, patients experienced a decrease in hyperarousal. “This is very significant. Neurofeedback may give patients the power to restore their patterns of brain activity and improve symptoms of psychiatric illness,” said Dr. Lanius, who is also a professor in the Department of Psychiatry at Western University’s Schulich School of Medicine <span>&amp;</span> Dentistry. “This means that existing mechanisms of the human brain may be harnessed for therapy, providing an alternative to pharmaceutical and brain stimulation therapies.”</p>
<p>Dr. Lanius and her collaborators are currently continuing this research with a larger group of patients with <span>PTSD</span>. Patients in this study will complete multiple sessions of brain training to determine whether positive effects can be sustained long-term.</p>
<p>The study, “<a href="http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/09/12/cercor.bhw285.abstract" rel="nofollow">Neurofeedback tunes scale-free dynamics in spontaneous brain activity</a>”, was published in the journal <em>Cerebral Cortex</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>20,000 had died as a result of the tsunami by the time I spoke with Joi. Three reactor cores had melted. Unknown to most at the time, sixteen radioactive <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49379-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plumes</a> were sweeping across the Fukushima countryside. Families across the nation, some being <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK253930/table/tab_6-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relocated</a> and all glued to the news, were asking: Are we safe? Should we stay indoors? Can our children drink the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3701991/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">milk</a>?</p>
<p>There were no clear answers, but there was plenty of speculation. Datasets available to the government and power company were withheld from the public. Scientists across the world, eager to evaluate the situation, were left guessing.</p>
<p>That day in March 2011, Joi told me that he and a small cast of characters had assembled a rough plan for <em>Open Global Sensing</em>. I’d just left Microsoft where, in my role as Chief Software Architect, I’d started and nurtured a new product called <em>Azure</em>. “We could use your cloud and data expertise. Will you join us?</p>

<p>A few weeks later 15 of us <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/seanbonner/5629245498/in/album-72157626383390989/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">met</a> in Tokyo, came together around a mission, and set off to Akihabara. Within days, a volunteer’s car had been <a href="https://safecast.org/2011/04/first-safecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">armed</a> with a laptop, a GPS, and a high-quality Geiger counter. The team began mapping radiation levels and uploading them as CC0-licensed data for all the world to see. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-0434-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Citizens became scientists</a>, and <a href="https://safecast.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Safecast</a> was born.</p>

<p>Over 10 years, using more than two thousand sensors, more than ten thousand volunteers have worked to gather a <a href="https://map.safecast.org/?y=37.28&amp;x=139.7&amp;z=8&amp;l=0&amp;m=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rapidly growing dataset and map</a> of hundreds of millions of data points. During that time, the team has used commercial IoT technology to create <a href="https://safecast.org/devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ten generations of sensors</a> – some fixed, some mobile. Some measuring radiation, some air quality. Some hard-wired, some solar powered. With support of several <a href="https://safecast.org/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generous benefactors</a>, Safecast’s citizen scientist volunteers have managed to build one of the largest open environmental datasets in existence.</p>
<figure><a href="https://map.safecast.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <img src="https://blues.io/blog/images/safecast-map.png" alt="Screenshot the live map at Safecast.org"> </a><figcaption><a href="https://map.safecast.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But gathering that data was far, far too difficult. If we’re to benefit from a world of devices that are cloud-connected from birth, IoT needs a new soul.</p>
<h2 id="surfing-the-public-airwaves">Surfing the Public Airwaves</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I came to believe that the only viable business model for large-scale cellular IoT is the <em>Kindle’s Whispernet</em> model, where the lifetime cost of cellular is simply embedded into the cost of the product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Low data-rate applications don’t need the complexity of Linux, containers, or edge computing. For these solutions, AI/ML is best done in the cloud, with microcontroller-based device design focused on simplicity, reliability, low power, and low cost.</p>
<p>The earliest Safecast devices recorded their data onto SD cards. We embraced Bluetooth for mobile phone-based upload, and then <a href="https://www.semtech.com/lora/what-is-lora" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LoRa</a> and <a href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LoRaWAN</a> for fixed location backhaul. LoRa is an amazing technology, and we came close to becoming addicted due to its low power and low cost. But being a global project with a low density of devices, each time we deployed a sensor we ended up needing to build our own network – a consuming undertaking that was greatly complicated by the fact that LoRa chips and concentrators and spectrum rules vary around the world.</p>
<p>The answer, of course, was to use the globally-harmonized public airwaves of cellular.</p>
<p>But what a nightmare! Cellular has huge power draw; it’s a significant challenge for hardware developers to build battery-powered cellular devices. Cellular modems have arcane interfaces and are extremely awkward for developers to deal with. Carriers and cloud providers now (rightfully) require device certificates, TLS, and firmware update, adding even more complexity to the simple task of uploading just a little bit of data.</p>
<p>What’s more, the cellular business model of charging “per month per device” is fundamentally flawed for narrowband cellular IoT, where devices are very high-volume, low-cost, and may even be discarded. Charge the user? Charge the vendor? Charge even when it’s broken? I came to believe that the only viable business model for large-scale cellular IoT is the <em>Kindle’s Whispernet</em> model, where the lifetime cost of cellular is simply embedded into the cost of the product. For the user, <em>it just works</em>.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-data-pump">A Simple Data Pump</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re counting on you software folks to solve that problem, Ray.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For many applications – including Safecasts’s – all you need is a simple <em>data pump</em>. Take a little bit of data, perhaps hourly or daily, format it in a simple way, like JSON, and deliver it securely to a cloud-based app via REST. Is that too much to ask?</p>
<p>Before investing more time and energy on this problem at Safecast, I began to talk to others in the industry. Does anybody have a simple way of dealing with low-power cellular from a developer perspective? No one did.</p>
<p>Next, I decided to talk with a number of the thousands of commercial and industrial customers I’ve met with over the years. I heard horror stories about how they tried cellular and gave up. Stories of how they tried Wi-Fi, and now want to bail because it’s a complete <a href="https://www.inc.com/will-yakowicz/a-smart-refrigerator-can-take-down-your-business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cesspool</a>. To a customer, they were all stories of frustration.</p>
<p>I happen to be very close to the leadership of a few cellular carriers, and so I pressed them: How are you (as an industry) going to realize the promise of cellular if it’s so difficult for developers to use?</p>
<p>Their answer? “We’re counting on you software folks to solve that problem, Ray.”</p>
<p>And so began another journey.</p>
<h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Today’s opportunity is not just about improving our own interactions, but in learning how best to collaborate <em>with machines</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In building Lotus Notes, Groove, and Talko, I’ve spent decades of my career building software in the field of <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/computer-supported-cooperative-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer-Supported Cooperative Work</a>. In the soul of that software was the aspiration to improve outcomes by qualitatively improving interactions among co-workers.</p>
<p>Today’s opportunity is not just about improving our own interactions, but in learning how best to collaborate <em>with machines</em>. Distributed networks of sensors can enable us to know what’s happening in our environment; in our fleets; in our patients; in the COVID vaccination delivery chain; in our food supply; in our HVAC systems; at the entrances to our offices.</p>
<p>Sensors and controls will be ubiquitous in business. They should give us greater <em>situational awareness</em> and should empower us to work together more effectively and serve customers more effectively.</p>
<p>In starting and leading Blues Wireless, my objective is to make it possible for every organization to be able to collaborate with machines to improve their business and improve the world, through visibility, transparency, and control.</p>
<p>We’ve built a few new components – the <a href="https://blues.io/products/"><em>Notecard</em></a> and the <a href="https://notehub.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Notehub</em></a> – that have the potential to fundamentally change the game in the cellular world. With its Safecast roots, simplicity and <em>IoT for good</em> are at the soul of the Notecard.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://blues.io/blog/images/notecard.png" alt="Close-up photo of the Notecard."> <figcaption>
            <p>Our first product, the Notecard.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But with my own roots being in the commercial world, they’re packaged it in a form that you can use to embed this <em>cloud data pump</em> in your product. Your machine.</p>
<p>Perhaps something that notifies you when a rodent trap or dumpster needs to be emptied, to keep our alleys clean. Or something that sends an alert when the power goes out on a fridge full of medication. Or something that takes action when a low-income tenant’s home gets too cold.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with fancy expensive devices that do edge computing and local AI, but we love dumb old devices at Blues. We love ‘brownfield’ and we love retrofits. The simpler, the cheaper, the broader, the better.</p>
<p>Because it’s our dream that by monitoring the environment at a personal, grassroots level, we can be better educated and in touch with our earth. We’re committed to help make that happen.</p>
<p>But it’s also our dream that by adding simple inexpensive monitors for our food, our fuel, our fridges, our health, that the benefits of the ‘cloud’ and the ‘edge’ can extend to everyone, including the old, the disadvantaged, and the under-served.</p>
<p>It’s our dream that once you see how easy it is to make your product <em>cloud connected from birth</em>, that this little cloud data pump – the Notecard – might <em>itself</em> turn out to be the soul of a new machine: yours.</p>

<p>At the start of December, I switched jobs to a new games company. While I really enjoyed being a lead programmer at my previous company, I found it difficult to combine both my leadership and programming responsibilities. I ended up feeling like I wasn’t doing my best work on either. My calendar often looked like Swiss cheese, with small meetings interspersed throughout my day. I’ve taken a step back on my leadership responsibilities now, so I can focus more on writing code.</p>



<p>But since my new job didn’t start for another six weeks, I decided to run an experiment on myself. I’ve always been curious about whether an 8-hour workday was actually optimal for me. Now that I had no boss to report to and no coworkers to keep in the loop, why not try cutting my work hours in half? My hope was that I would be able to achieve some kind of momentum on my personal project. I’m happy to report this was definitely the case and that I’ve learned a lot, more than can fit in a single blog post!</p>







<p>My game <em>Up There They Love</em> has been in production in some shape or form for almost three years now. While I had always intended for it to be a “forever project”, something that I could always return to when inspiration struck, it also felt kind of stuck in development hell. Games are meant to be played and I never got to the point where players could actually do that.</p>



<p>To explain it briefly, <em>Up There They Love</em> is an adult visual novel combined with a character management sim and a sexy card game. I designed all of the mechanics, programmed the whole game myself, and have done most of the writing. While friends have helped out over the years, this has always been a solo project. And yes, I’m <a href="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/programming/building-a-tech-stack-for-my-visual-novel/">building my own engine</a>.</p>



<p>The state of the game in early December last year was that the character management sim had been (mostly) implemented already, but the visual novel had not received a lot of love and the card game was just an idea; it hadn’t been designed at all.</p>



<p>So now that I had some time between work assignments, I wanted to see how much I could get done on my game if I fully committed to it. Would I be able to implement the core loop of my game and finally get something playable?</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In this three-part series, I will explain some of the strategies I employed during this period and how effective they were for my productivity.</p>







<p>This experiment did not form in a vacuum. I had recently read the book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time">Make Time</a> and I felt highly inspired to try it out. What makes this book so great is that it isn’t about applying One Neat Trick that will instantly fix your entire life but instead asks you to pick a few things that suit your style of working from a list of 80 different tactics.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime-1024x768.jpg" data-src="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime-1024x768.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime.jpg 1280w" data-sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px" srcset="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/maketime.jpg 1280w"></a></figure>



<p>There were a number of tips that I implemented immediately, but I also wanted to try out a few ideas of my own. Specifically, I wanted to see how far I could get by working very intensely on my game, but for only four hours a day.</p>



<p>I wanted to do all of my work between 8 AM and noon, have lunch, and then do something else for the rest of the day. The idea being that I could get a lot done on my game while also having more time for other activities that bring me joy, like lazily watching my shows on the couch.</p>



<p>I’m happy to report that this experiment was a resounding success. I was able to make <em>incredible </em>progress on my game while also streaming a season and a half of the brilliant superhero drama <em>The Boys</em>.</p>



<p>So how did I do all that?</p>







<p>One of the recommendations from <em>Make Time</em> is to turn off all notifications on your phone and other devices except those that you explicitly <em>want</em> to be interrupted by. The default on your phone is to interrupt you whenever, it’s high time to challenge that notion!</p>



<p>I decided to turn off all notifications except Google Calendar (meetings), LoseIt (diet tracking reminders), and WhatsApp (family &amp; friends). I also explicitly logged out of Twitter in the morning, which added some friction to wasting time on that website.</p>



<p>Next, I wanted to meticulously plan my mornings. I’m a morning person and get up at 6 AM every day, but I’m not always spending that time wisely. I decided to map out the two hours between 6 AM and 8 AM to an exact schedule:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-1024x576.png" data-src="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-1024x576.png" alt="" data-srcset="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-300x169.png 300w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-768x432.png 768w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine.png 1280w" data-sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px" srcset="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-300x169.png 300w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-768x432.png 768w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine.png 1280w"></a></figure>



<p>I’m able to do this is that I don’t have any children, I no longer have a commute, and my wife likes to sleep in until at least 8:30 AM. I’m therefore able to perfectly control my schedule in the morning, which definitely makes me an outlier. So don’t feel bad if you cannot apply this type of schedule to your own mornings!</p>



<p>My morning routine acknowledges my Twitter addiction, but I also explicitly block out time for planning my day. This does not always work out <em>perfectly</em>, but it does give me a much better chance of having a productive day.</p>







<p>Even though I no longer had any teammates to interrupt me, I still blocked out the time between 8 AM and noon in my calendar every day for doing focused work. This ensured that I would be in the right headspace and allow me to focus on getting stuff done. I would clear the notification from my phone when I started working, which helped me to get in the groove.</p>



<p>I stuck to this schedule for six weeks while waiting for my new job to begin. And the main thing I found is that I had to unlearn a lot of bad habits. It turns out that a lot of time at work is usually <a href="https://nesslabs.com/illusion-of-productivity">spent on busywork</a>! When I’m stuck on a problem at work, I tend to distract myself with e-mails or checking Twitter. But when your workday is only four hours, you really can’t afford to do that!</p>



<p>That’s why adding a bit of friction to Twitter was really useful. When I got stuck on a problem in one area, I would instead switch contexts to another area of my game. For example, I would work on the UI design when I was stuck on a coding problem and work on making temp art when I couldn’t figure out the game design.</p>



<p>Because I have ADHD, I find it very easy to slip into what the ADHD community calls “hyperfocus”. This is a mental state in which the whole world fades away and nothing becomes more important than the work in front of you. Getting into hyperfocus is in fact so easy for me to do that my main issue has always been getting <em>out</em> of this mental state. Setting a strict deadline helps with that: I can use my hyperfocus to get a lot done and I stop working when it’s time for lunch.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I did not always follow my own advice. There were definitely days that I worked beyond my four-hour limit. And I just want to put it in writing: <em>every time I did that was a mistake</em>. I did not get more done and instead just made myself jittery and anxious for no good reason. Hyperfocus is an extremely tiring mental state, it’s not possible to sustain it for more than a few hours without a serious crash the next day.</p>







<p>Working four hours a day for six week gave me 120 hours of time devoted to my game, or three full-time weeks. But I feel I got more done than that would imply. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Some of my accomplishments:</p>



<ul><li>All major gameplay systems implemented!</li><li>Implemented card game prototype in the actual game</li><li>Closed the gameplay loop from placement to night gameplay and back again</li><li>Created new temp art for 2 / 3 characters</li><li>Added code generation for widgets, screens, and Sass files</li><li>Converted most CSS to use <a href="https://css-tricks.com/abem-useful-adaptation-bem/">ABEM</a> naming scheme</li><li>Fixed not being able to use <a href="http://blog.bahraniapps.com/gifcam/">GifCam</a> to capture footage</li><li>Added base widget class that renders itself when internal state changes (future blog post material!)</li><li>Converted all widgets and screens in the game to use new base class</li><li>Added localization system and used it for all new screens in the game</li><li>Perfected nightly build system using <a href="http://www.buildout.org/en/latest/">buildout</a></li><li>Added animations to <a href="https://twitter.com/mrhands31/status/1349311128468398083">night gameplay</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mrhands31/status/1352583568262914049">task outcome</a> screens</li></ul>







<p>It’s clear to me that I can get a lot done if I focus on reducing distractions and focus my efforts where it matters. Now that I’m gainfully employed again, I don’t think it will be acceptable for me to tell my boss that I would like to do all of my work in four hours yet get paid for eight. But I will definitely carry some of the learnings from this experiment with me.</p>



<p>What I intend to do now is roughly divide my workday in two: mornings are for <strong>focused </strong>work like coding and solving technical problems, while afternoons are for <strong>collaborative </strong>work like writing documentation and doing code reviews. But since I’ll be working from home in the foreseeable future, I will definitely be sticking to my morning routine!</p>



<p>In the next parts of this series, I will discuss how I figure out my task priorities and how I used public accountability to keep myself motivated.</p>

        <p><strong>Hi! Dan and Nathan here.</strong> Early in 2020, we launched the Everything Bundle, a Substack devoted to productivity and business strategy. We started with two newsletters, Superorganizers and Divinations, written and produced by just us. Almost twelve months later, we now have eight newsletters in the bundle, written by some of the smartest, most accomplished practitioners in tech and startups: Li Jin, Tiago Forte, Nat Eliason, Jerry Colonna, and Sherrell Dorsey.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The response has been far better than we ever anticipated: the Everything Bundle has been read by over 750,000 people, it has almost 2,400 paid subscribers, and has cracked the top 10 on Substackâ€™s paid newsletter leaderboard. To us, the signal is clear that there is value in a bundle like this. Readers want access to a place that consistently delivers business writing from a variety of perspectivesâ€”for one subscription price.</p>

        <p>Weâ€™re proud of what weâ€™ve built so far, but we think itâ€™s just the start. Today we want to share where weâ€™re going, what we stand for, and why we exist. But first, a few announcements:</p>

        <h5>The Everything Bundle is now Every.</h5> 
        <p>We started by covering productivity and strategy, and our hope is to cover every industry and job role, every broad theme and niche interest. Weâ€™ve picked the name Every as one that reflects that scope.&nbsp;</p>

        <h5>Weâ€™re structured as a writer collectiveâ€”a new model for a media company.</h5>
        <p>Weâ€™ve been doing it for almost a year, and now weâ€™re ready to talk about it. A writer collective is a way to write thatâ€™s somewhere between starting a Substack and working for <em>The New York Times</em>. We give our writers financial upside in the work they do and the freedom to build their own creative vision, but we also support them with distribution to an audience, editorial support, and an advance on their subscription revenue if they need it. Weâ€™re excited to see ideas like this becoming <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/business/media/brick-house-journalism-cooperative.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">part</a> of the <a href="https://www.axios.com/forbes-paid-newsletter-subscriptions-ab423ae1-0b90-4863-acad-40a373adce80.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">zeitgeist</a>: we believe it is the best structure to support diverse voices, uncover undercovered topics, and create quality writing that can help our readers think differently about business and solve real-world problems.</p>

        <h5>Weâ€™ve moved onto our own homegrown platform.</h5> 
        <p>Our business wouldnâ€™t exist without Substack, and we think the world of them, but weâ€™re excited to announce that Every will be run on a platform we built ourselves. Weâ€™re technology people. And as weâ€™ve grown, we keep coming up with ideas to make our product and business better. So we decided to build our own CMS, one that works differently from anything that already exists, and gives us the freedom to evolve it however we want as we seek new ways to meet the needs of our audience.&nbsp;</p>

        <h5>Weâ€™ve raised a pre-seed round from Eric Stromberg at Bedrock and a group of ambitious angels.</h5>
        <p>Weâ€™ve known Eric for many years, and because heâ€™s a former founder in the space and a&nbsp; current investor in The Athletic, Cameo, and Dipsea, we think heâ€™s the perfect person to help us build our vision.</p>

        <p>Weâ€™re building Every because we believe there is someone in every industryâ€”from wealth management to waste managementâ€”whose eyes sparkle when they talk about their work. These people are ambitious, and they are curious. They think of business as a subject that is intellectually interesting, and as an activity that can be pursued not just for personal gain, but also as an expression of soul. They care deeply about what they do because they see how it connects to the lives of the people they serve: they can tell you how everything in the world depends on their job getting done.</p>

        <p>You have never heard of most of these people, but they are out there. We hope to find them and bring them to our readersâ€”by writing about them, and by writing with them. We believe by doing so, we can help build a better world: the stories told today become the businesses built tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Weâ€™ve dedicated ourselves to this mission because we believe great business writing is currently too rare. Weâ€™d love to walk you why we think itâ€™s rare, and how a writer collective can help make more of it.</p>

        <h2>Why is great business writing rare?&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>There is more business writing on the internet than a single mind can fathom. Much of it is amazing, but as we all sadly know, thereâ€™s a lot that isâ€¦ not. Weâ€™re all burned and burdened by the glut of â€œthink pieces,â€� advertorials, and hastily composed posts that donâ€™t reach for nuance or complexity.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>We think this happens for three primary reasons.</p>
        <h4>1 - Great business writing requires multiple skills</h4>
        <p>To write something great about business, you have to know something worth writing about, and you need to be able to write about it in a compelling way. Unfortunately, the number of people who can do both is vanishingly small.</p>
        
        <p>        
          <img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/static/rare-venn.jpg">
        </p>

        <p>Most of the people who know what theyâ€™re talking about donâ€™t write. Writing is hard, itâ€™s time consuming, and, honestly, itâ€™s agonizing. You canâ€™t take a magic pill and suddenly wake up as a compelling writerâ€”you just have to spend years and years doing it. Itâ€™s a craft.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>On the other hand, there are many skilled writers who donâ€™t have enough business knowledge. Or they simply donâ€™t have the time to dive deeply enough into their subject to do it justice. Which brings us to our second point.</p>

        <h4>2 - Writers are pressured to publish too often</h4>
        <p>Great writing takes time. Yes, thereâ€™s the time it takes to write and edit. But it also takes time to experience things worth writing about, to reflect, and to learn. Thereâ€™s no shortcut or trick that can solve this constraint. Thatâ€™s why the best writing, often found in books and magazines, develops over months, if not years.</p>

        <p>Of course that timescale is rare on the internet. Writers who work for ad-supported digital publications often need to produce daily, if not multiple times a day. Solo paid newsletters need to publish at least weekly, if not 2-3 times a week. Weâ€™ve done this ourselves, and some of our favorite writers do it with a level of quality and consistency that boggles the mindâ€”but itâ€™s grueling. You get burned out. We did.</p>

        <p>When youâ€™re burned out, you forget what inspired you to start writing in the first place. You scroll through Twitter â€œlooking for ideasâ€� and contemplate a career change to carpentry, until, defeated, you curl into a nap. You realize that your sense of curiosity, rather than driving your work, is currently in hidingâ€”which brings us to our third point.</p>

        <h4>3 - Most writing is chasing clout, rather than insight</h4>
        <p>Every writer wants clout. But when you prioritize clout over curiosity, the work suffers. You try to play up popular narratives. You worry about keeping up.&nbsp; You look at what everyone else is writing about, and you try to write the same thingâ€”but better. You opine on every trending topicâ€”even when you donâ€™t have anything new to add to the conversation. You say dumb things to get attention. (Okay, to be fair, we have <a href="https://every.to/divinations/quibi-will-be-a-multi-billion-dollar-355585" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">done that</a> ourselves, but at least hopefully in an interesting way ðŸ™ˆ.)</p>

        <p>This strategy can attract attention, but it leaves readers unsatisfied, and doesnâ€™t age well. Itâ€™s like blowing counterclockwise into a hurricane and claiming credit when it reaches a Category 5. Aiming directly for clout is all about profiting from trends, rather than creating them. Itâ€™s about answering questions that have already been asked, not about asking new questions.</p>

        <p>When you put all of these forces togetherâ€”an arena that requires multiple skills to succeed, the incessant pressure to publish, and the human tendency to chase cloutâ€”you end up with a lot of writing thatâ€™s kind of like cotton candy. It tastes good at first, but it gives you a stomachache after a while. Worse, it creates a narrative ecosystem that rewards folks who already have money and an audience, rather than reflecting the best of what our community knowsâ€”and wants to knowâ€”about the world.</p>

        <p>So, what to do? Write together, rather than alone.&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>How writing together solves these problems</h2>
        <p>Writing together isnâ€™t trending right now, but itâ€™s actually pretty great.&nbsp;</p>

        <ol>
         <li>When you write together, you donâ€™t need one person to have both business knowledge and writing talent. You can find one person who has business knowledge and another person who has writing skill, and then create systems that support them writing together. Now youâ€™ve unlocked both business experience and writing talent in a way that wasnâ€™t possible before.</li>
         <li>When you write together, you donâ€™t have to publish so often that you risk burning out. Instead, the group can share the load. That means each writer has time to produce higher quality work, but readers still get content on a consistent schedule.</li>
  
         <li>And finally, when you write together, you can form a culture that pushes you to write from a genuine sense of curiosity, expertise, and interest, rather than clout-chasing. You can hold each other accountable to this when you veer away from it, and you can encourage each other to pursue the fragile little sparks of inspiration that turn into the best pieces. You start to care more about the respect of the community youâ€™re part of than about mindlessly moving numbers.&nbsp;</li>
       </ol>

       <p>Of course, weâ€™re not the first people to discover the merits of writing in groupsâ€¦&nbsp;</p>

       <h2>Magazines. Youâ€™ve invented magazines.</h2>
       <p>Turns out, traditional publishers have already solved this problem! Wouldnâ€™t it be ironic if the future of media looked exactly like the past? A great unbundling, resulting in a speedy rebundling into the exact same structures that existed before?</p>

Load balancing is the activity of effectively distributing traffic load across multiple servers.</p><p>This is how we achieve highly available applications that help us achieve scaling effectively.</p><h2>What is load-balancing?</h2><p><span>- Advertisement -</span> <ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1198872678846288" data-ad-slot="2989761355"></ins> </p><p>Since nobody can afford a web server overload, we scale out our backend servers to multiple machines. The aim is to have a distributed architecture and to avoid having all users connecting to a single server and choke it up. Therefore we distribute the incoming traffic by making use of a load balancer.</p><figure><img src="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-1024x582.png" alt="load balancing" width="762" height="433" srcset="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-1024x582.png 1024w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-300x170.png 300w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-768x436.png 768w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-696x395.png 696w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing.png 1070w" sizes="(max-width: 762px) 100vw, 762px"></figure><p>The load balancer thus becomes a key component in our architecture, diverting traffic based on different techniques that we will discuss later in this post. Its main responsibility is to avoid convergence of traffic and thus avoiding choking of the system.</p><p>Load balancers thus become the first point of contact for the client requests.</p><p>There can be multiple load balancers in a system as well. One each for various tiers of the application. This would help handle the separate application tiers more effectively and also scale them independently if needed.</p><figure><img src="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-1024x472.png" alt="load balancing multiple tiers" srcset="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-1024x472.png 1024w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-300x138.png 300w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-768x354.png 768w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-696x321.png 696w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers.png 1276w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>It is also important to mention that when a load balancer redirects to a particular location, it might not hit an application server. It might hit another load balancer that is implemented at a location-based cluster in a data center if we were scaling globally.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>If a server goes down, the load balancer also ensures that no traffic is directed to that server until it is back up and running. This is done by performing health checks that ensure the load balancer is only sending traffic to servers that are online.</p><p>But how do we decide which machine the user will land upon?</p><h2>Types of load balancing</h2><p>There are three types of load balancing:</p><ol><li>DNS load balancing</li><li>Hardware-based load balancing</li><li>Software-based load balancing</li></ol><p>As with everything, there are pros and cons to either of the approaches. Let us discuss them in detail.</p><h2>DNS load balancing</h2><p>DNS load balancing is the most commonly used technique for load balancing. Instead of having dedicated hardware for resolving which server to redirect to, a nameserver is responsible for managing traffic.</p><p>The nameserver has a list of IP addresses that correspond to the various servers that can be routed to. Every time someone queries for a particular domain, the nameserver returns this list of IP addresses and changes the order of the addresses. The reordering is done in a round-robin fashion. Thus, every new request is routed to a different machine in a round-robin order And the load gets distributed among different servers.</p><p>The reason a list of IP addresses is returned and not a single IP address is to have a failover strategy. If the first IP address does not respond in a stipulated amount of time, the client can call the next IP address in the list.</p><p>Though this is a popular strategy, it has its limitations too. What the strategy does not factor in is the existing load on the server, the processing time of the server, their online status, etc.</p><p>Another limitation of this technique is that IP addresses are cached on the client machine’s DNS resolver. This can be mitigated by setting a low TTL (time to live, or how long to store the mapping for). But it is a tradeoff since longer TTL means clients do not know about changes and shorter TTL may improve accuracy but increases DNS processing and DNS caching was implemented to mitigate that in the first place. Also, the client might choose to disregard your TTL value altogether. So it is not guaranteed.</p><p>Another limitation is of possibly routing to a machine that is not functional will exist. Though most cloud services these days do provide health checks along with DNS balancing these days, but it might not be true for all services.</p><p>The most common use case for this type of load balancing is for distributing traffic across multiple data centers, possibly in different regions. It is also preferred by companies because it is a cost-effective solution and easy to deploy.</p><h2>Hardware-based load balancing</h2><p>As the name suggests, we use physical appliances as a load balancer. They sit in front of the application servers and handle the distribution of traffic.</p><p>These are highly performant pieces of hardware that factor in the number of open connections, how much compute is being utilized and several other parameters to decide where to route the traffic to.</p><p>Having dedicated hardware to take care of load balancing is highly performant. It also is efficient since a dedicated machine is responsible for evaluating load distribution. The throughput is fast because of the specialized processors. It also provides the benefit of increased security since physical access to the hardware can be limited by the organization.</p><p>But hardware is expensive to purchase, to set up and it requires maintenance and regular updates. It can also require network specialists since it can be a lot of work to do for a developer.</p><p>Another disadvantage is that we have to factor in the scenarios where there is extreme peak traffic and plan for purchasing hardware accordingly. This is not the case for software-based load balancers.</p><h2>Software-based load balancing</h2><p>Software-based load balancing is the process of installing load balancing software on cost-effective hardware and VMs. They are cheaper and provide more flexibility than the hardware ones. They can also be provisioned and upgraded easily.</p><p>The major benefit of software-based load balancers over DNS load balancers is the flexibility and the advanced configuration options. We can configure load balancing on the basis of multiple parameters like cookies, HTTP headers, CPU utilization, memory consumption, network load, etc. We will discuss the different algorithms that can be implemented in detail later.</p><p>A benefit of the software-based approach over the hardware one is that we can scale beyond the initial capacity by just adding more VM based instances. No need to buy additional specialized hardware. We also would have to plan ahead of time for peak traffic if we were buying specialized hardware to manage it. In the cloud, there are no hardware balancers, and you purchase more virtual machines to fulfill your needs. This ends up being cheaper.</p><p>There are many “software-balancers as a service” services out there that allow us to use them without any configuration of our own. Or we can install the software from one of the open-sourced versions ourselves. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/haproxy/haproxy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HAProxy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nginx/nginx" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nginx</a> are fairly common ones that many enterprises use as well.</p><p>Since there are a lot of ways in which the software-based load balancers can be configured, we will discuss the major algorithms to do so next.</p><h3>Traffic routing algorithms used by software balancers</h3><p><strong>Round Robin: </strong>Similar to DNS based routing, a software uses a list of IP addresses and rotates through this list on every request. Nothing else is taken as a parameter.</p><p><strong>Weighted round-robin</strong>: A modified variation of the round-robin in which the traffic is routed in a weighted manner. The weights are determined by the server’s traffic capacity and compute capabilities. Thus, machines that can handle more traffic get more of it relative to those that can handle less.</p><p><strong>Least connections:</strong> Traffic is redirected to the machine that has the least amount of current network connections. Similar to the previous one, there are two approaches. One assumes that all requests to a server take equal server resources. The other takes into account the server’s traffic capacity and compute capabilities while making the decision of least open connections.<br>This approach is a good candidate for scenarios where the connections are long-term ones and stay open for larger durations, such as live streams or gaming applications.</p><p><strong>Random:</strong> The load balancer picks two servers randomly and then using the least connections mechanism, sends the request to the one that gets selected.</p><p><strong>Hash-based: </strong>A key is defined on the basis of which distribution takes place. The key could be the client IP address, or the request URL, or both. Hashing the IP ensures that the requests from an IP are always redirected to the same server. This is useful in cases where the server has some in-memory data/cache about the user’s information.</p><p><strong>Least time:</strong> This builds up on the least connections method. The traffic is redirected to the server with the fewest active connections and the lowest average response time.</p><p>And that is all there is to know about the basics of load balancing. Load balancing plays a prominent role in distributed architectures and helps in scaling our applications. It also helps improve responsiveness and achieve high availability.</p><p>If you have any queries, feel free to drop a comment below.</p></div></div></div>]]>

        <p>We rendered the <a href="https://tranco-list.eu/">top 1 million pages</a> on the web, tracking every conceivable performance metric, logging every error, noting every requested URL. To our knowledge this produces the first dataset that connects performance, errors, and library use on the web. In this article we analyze what the data can tell us about creating high performance web sites.</p>
        <div>
            <p><b>1M </b> pages visited
            </p>
            <p><b>65</b> metrics per page

        <p>Can you do better than our analysis? We <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/indexhtml/web-performance-metrics">published the dataset to Kaggle</a>, so you can crunch the numbers yourself.</p>
        <h2>Why render a million web pages?</h2>
        <p>
            A common sentiment these days is that the web is somehow slower and buggier than it was 15 years ago. Because of an ever-growing pile of JavaScript and frameworks and webfonts and polyfills, we've eaten up all the gains that faster computers, networks and protocols have given us. Or so the argument goes. We wanted to check if this was actually true and try to find what common factors are causing slow and broken websites in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            The high level plan was simple: Scripting a web browser, having it render the root page of the top 1 million domains, and logging every conceivable metric: render times, request counts, repaints, JavaScript errors, libraries used, etc. With all this data, we can ask questions about how one factor correlates with another. What factors contribute most to slow render times? Which libraries are correlated with long time-to-interactive? What are the most common errors, and what's causing them?
        </p>
        <p>
            Gathering the data was a matter of writing a bit of code to use Puppeteer to script Chrome, firing up 200 EC2 instances, rendering a million web pages over the weekend, and praying that you've actually understood how AWS pricing works.
        </p>

        <h2>Overall numbers</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Protocol use for root HTML document</b></li>

            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 3 (0.08%)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>HTTP 2 is now more common than HTTP 1.1, but HTTP 3 is still rare. (Note: We're counting anything using the QUIC protocol as HTTP 3, even if Chrome sometimes reports this as HTTP 2 + QUIC.) This was for the root document, for linked resources the protocol numbers look a bit different.</p>

        <p>There's a handful of scripts that are linked on a large portion of web sites. This means we can expect these resources to be in cache, right? Not any more: Since Chrome 86, <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/10/http-cache-partitioning">resources requested from different domains will not share a cache</a>. Firefox is planning to implement the same. Safari has been splitting its cache like this for years.</p>

        <h2>What makes the web slow: Predicting time-to-interactive</h2>

        <p>
            Given this dataset of web pages and their load time metrics, it would be nice to learn something about what it is that makes web pages slow. We'll investigate the dominteractive metric, which is the time it takes before the document becomes interactive to the user. The simplest thing we could do is just to look at the correlation of each metric with dominteractive.
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/dominteractive-correlation.png" alt="Correlations with dominteractive">
            </p><blockquote>Correlations of metrics with dominteractive</blockquote>
        
        <p>
            Essentially every metric is positively correlated with dominteractive, except the 0-1 variable indicating HTTP2 or greater. Many of these metrics are also positively correlated with each other. We need a more sophisticated approach to get at individual factors contributing to a high time-to-interactive.
        </p>

        <p>Some of the metrics are timings, measured in milliseconds. We can look at their box-plot to get an idea of where browsers are spending their time.</p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/timings-box-plot.png" alt="Box plot of web page timings"></p><blockquote>Box-plot of timing metrics. The orange line is the median, the box goes from the 25th to the 75th percentile.</blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>
            One way to get at the individual factors contributing to a high time-to-interactive is to do a linear regression, where we predict dominteractive from other metrics. That means we assign a weight to each metric and model the dominteractive time of a page as the weighted sum of the other metrics, plus some constant. An optimization algorithm sets the weights so as to minimize the prediction error over the whole dataset. The size of the weights found by the regression tells us something about how much each metric contributes to the slowness of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll exclude timing metrics from the regression. If we spend 500ms establishing a connection, that adds 500ms to dominteractive, but this is not a particularly interesting insight. Timing metrics are fundamentally <em>outcomes</em>. We want to learn what causes them.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Regression coefficients for metrics, predicting dominteractive</b></li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            The numbers in parenthesis are the regression coefficients learned by the optimization algorithm. You can interpret these as having units of milliseconds. While the exact numbers should be taken with a grain of salt (see note below), it is interesting to see the scale assigned to each feature. For example, the model predicts a 354ms slow down for every redirect needed to deliver the main document. Whenever the main HTML document is delivered via HTTP2 or higher, the model predicts a 477ms lower time-to-interactive. For each request triggered by the document, it predicts an additional 16 ms. 
        </p>

        <p>
            When interpreting regression coefficients, we need to keep in mind that we're operating on a simplified model of reality. Time-to-interactive is not in fact determined by a weighted sum of these input metrics. There are clearly causal factors the model has no chance of discovering. Confounding variables is clearly an issue. As an example, if loading the main document with HTTP2 is correlated with loading <i>other</i> requests over HTTP2, then the model will bake this advantage into the weights for main_doc_is_http2_or_greater, even if the speed up comes from requests other than the main document. We need to be cautious when mapping what the model says onto conclusions about reality.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the effect of HTTP protocol version on dominteractive?</h3>
        <p>Here's a fun plot of dominteractive split by the HTTP protocol version used to deliver the root HTML page.</p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/dominteractive-by-protocol.png" alt="Box-plot of dominteractive split by HTTP protocol version"></p><blockquote>Box-plot of dominteractive split by HTTP protocol version of the first request. The orange line is the median, the box goes from the 25th to the 75th percentile. The percentages in parenthesis are the fraction of requests made with this protocol.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <p>There's a tiny number of sites still delivered over HTTP 0.9 and 1.0. And these sites happen to be fast. It seems we can't disentangle the fact that protocols have gotten faster with the effect that programmers will happily consume this speed-up by delivering more stuff to the browser.</p>

        <p>This is for the protocol version used to deliver the root HTML page. What if we look at the effect of the protocol for resources linked in that document? If we do a regression on number of requests by protocol version, we get the following.</p>

        
        <p id="full-rs-expand"><a onclick="expandRs()">View regression code <span></span></a></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Regression coefficients for number of requests by protocol version, predicting dominteractive</b></li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http2_requests (14.18)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http3_requests (22.05)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http1_1_requests (25.14)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http1_0_requests (61.18)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If we were to believe this, we would conclude that moving requested resources from HTTP 1.1 to 2 gives a 1.8x speed-up, while going from HTTP 2 to 3 causes 0.6x slow down. Is it really true that HTTP 3 is a slower protocol? No: A more likely explanation is that HTTP 3 is rare, and that the few resources that are being sent over HTTP 3 (e.g. Google Analytics) are things that have a larger than average effect on dominteractive.</p>

        <h3>What is the effect of type of content on dominteractive?</h3>
        <p>Let's predict time-to-interactive from the number of bytes transferred, split by the type of data being transferred.</p>

        
        <p id="full-ts-expand"><a onclick="expandTs()">View regression code <span></span></a></p>
        

        <ul>
            <li><b>Regression coefficients for kilobytes transferred by request initiator, predicting dominteractive</b></li>

<p>In the past four years, I wrote three eBooks about programming. It’s like an
addiction.</p>
<p>I would be terrible at talking about writing techniques, so I won’t. But the
content is not everything when you write an eBook. You have to care about
creating <strong>beautiful files to release</strong>: PDF, ePub, Kindle…</p>
<p>Here is the story of how I built my eBooks, especially
<a href="https://gum.co/use-hooks">the last one</a>. After some trial and errors, in the
end, I used the same recipe as the two previous ones, and it involves a
fantastic tool: <strong>Pandoc</strong>.</p>

<p>I wanted my last eBook to be a practical guide, not an academic manual. So I
imagined a very <strong>custom design</strong>, with a <strong>dark theme</strong> and many colors (it is
not designed to be printed).</p>
<p>Since it was about coding, I also wanted to include some source code examples
with <strong>syntax highlighting</strong>.</p>
<p>Bust most of all, I wanted an efficient workflow.</p>

<p>I intended to release a first version of the book ASAP, then iterate thanks to
readers’ feedback and new ideas I had. For this reason, I wanted to focus on the
content and on the appearance <strong>independently</strong>.</p>

<p>I didn’t want to spend time on the presentation each time I updated the content.
I’m a web developer; it wouldn’t occur to me to edit my CSS each time I update
the HTML content. Same here.</p>

<p>I thought: why not just use <strong>MS Word</strong> or its Apple version, <strong>Pages</strong>? Well, I
tried. It didn’t go well.</p>
<p>You can customize pretty much everything you want. Every color, font family,
font size… But it gets trickier when you want to include source code.</p>
<p>Since I wanted to have syntax highlighting, the <em>less bad</em> solution I found was
to copy and paste from VS Code. At first, it looked (kind of) okay, but as soon
as I wanted to modify it, it went terribly: the formatting was lost, spaces were
inserted where I didn’t want them…</p>
<p>Definitely, these tools are not made to write content with embedded source code.</p>
<p>I also tried <strong>Illustrator</strong> and its open-source alternative,
<a href="https://www.scribus.net/"><strong>Scribus</strong></a>.</p>
<p>It was worse.</p>
<p>I admire people able to use these applications. They seem to require a lot of
training and practice. Unfortunately, I intended to release my book in the next
two years, so I didn’t have time to learn them. 😉</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m used to writing content using <strong>Markdown</strong>. Or in <strong>Slack</strong>. Or in
<strong>Notion</strong> (for this blog post). Today, we have such perfect tools for
writing. I didn’t want to struggle each time I update some examples.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, in the end, I relied on the tool I used for my previous books: <strong>Pandoc</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> is a command-line tool whose main feature is
converting some text (usually Markdown) to another format: HTML, ePub, PDF, etc.</p>
<p>I used it for my other books, and it’s perfect for “academic” work (thesis,
research articles). But I wasn’t sure that creating something a bit more
original, with shiny colors and such, was possible.</p>
<center>
<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I spent around 5 hours to write the content, and lost the same amount of time looking for a publishing software or Saas to generate beautiful PDF for developer-oriented content, with source code. The winner ended being the good old Pandoc 😅</p>— Sébastien Castiel (@scastiel) <a href="https://twitter.com/scastiel/status/1338477555272331265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2020</a></blockquote>
</center>
<p>To write the content, I could now write using Markdown, with the basic
formatting options I needed: titles, italic, source code… And the source code
was highlighted!</p>
<p>By the way, syntax highlighting is themeable, and I really wanted to use
<a href="https://draculatheme.com/">Dracula</a>, which I already used for my VSCode. So I
created
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scastiel/4c409156ad4bc6a6dbbfe2abbd163671#file-dracula-theme">a custom theme</a>
for it. 🙂</p>

<p>The only thing I find problematic with Pandoc is
<a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html">its documentation</a>. It contains a lot of
information, but it’s on one page.</p>
<p>One page!</p>
<p>So you scroll, then scroll, and scroll again. And when you want to find
something, you do Cmd/Ctrl+F, type “color”, oh cool, there is something. Then
you realize you’re in the section concerning the generation of some obscure and
unknown document format…</p>
<p>Anyway, you can usually find what you’re looking for. I’d just prefer if it used
something more modern, such as Gitbook or Docusaurus, to maintain the
documentation and make it easier to navigate.</p>

<p>Pandoc is very good at generating HTML or an ePub file. You can give it some CSS
to customize anything you want. It would be a dream if you were able to do the
same to generate a customized PDF.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is slightly more complicated…</p>

<p>To generate PDFs, Pandoc uses <em>pdflatex</em>, which relies on
<strong><a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a></strong>. The LaTeX language is used to write
documents with a powerful but unusual syntax. These documents are then converted
to PDF, Postscript, etc.</p>
<p>So, a little like Pandoc. But with a weird syntax instead of beautiful Markdown.</p>
<p>Long story short, if you want to customize the PDF rendered by Pandoc with
<em>pdflatex</em>, you don’t have a choice: you need to provide some LaTeX code, a bit
like CSS.</p>
<p>And I didn’t want to spend several months learning LaTeX—it’s truly fantastic,
you can do anything you want with it. So I did what every good developer hates
doing: search on Google and copy-paste pieces of code.</p>
<p>Here is, for example, how I managed to have the book title in the page footer:
(sorry if you are a LaTeX guru, it probably will hurt your eyes)</p>
<pre><code><span>\usepackage</span><span>{</span><span>fancyhdr</span><span>}</span><br><span>\pagestyle</span><span>{</span>fancy<span>}</span><br><span>\fancyhf</span><span>{</span><span>}</span><br><span>\lfoot</span><span>{</span><br>  <span>\begin</span><span>{</span><span>tikzpicture</span><span>}</span><span>[</span>overlay,baseline=<span>{</span>(0,0)<span>}</span><span>]</span><br>  <span>\node</span><span>[</span>rectangle, outer sep=0pt, text=white, anchor=west <span>]</span><br>    (pageno)<br>    <span>{</span>A React Developer’s Guide to Hooks, © Sebastien Castiel<span>}</span>;<br>  <span>\draw</span><span>[</span>fill=comment, draw=comment<span>]</span><br>    (<span>[</span>xshift=-<span>\oddsidemargin</span>-1in<span>]</span>pageno.north west)<br>      rectangle<br>    (<span>[</span>yshift=1.5pt<span>]</span>pageno.south east);<br>  <span>\end</span><span>{</span><span>tikzpicture</span><span>}</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Well, to be fair, it would have been much more straightforward if I just wanted
the book title. But I wanted it in an indigo rectangle starting from the far
left of the page.</p>

<p>Still, most of the time, I was able to get what I wanted. It just took more time
than I wanted to spend on it.</p>
<p><em>You can find here
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scastiel/4c409156ad4bc6a6dbbfe2abbd163671#file-header-tex">the complete LaTeX header file</a>
I used for my book. I cleaned it a little and added some comments.</em></p>
<p>Although I didn’t interact with them, I’m sure the LaTeX community is fantastic
because you can find many resources on the Internet: answers on forums,
tutorials, manuals, etc.</p>

<p>I think the last time I used the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">GNU make</a> utility was like
ten years ago. I had this idea that it was only used by C or C++ projects.</p>
<p>If you never heard of <strong>GNU make</strong>, it’s a utility program to run specific
commands to generate files. It’s mostly used to compile and build programs, but
you can use it for any command.</p>
<p>My first intuition was to write a shell script to generate my book in several
formats. Quickly, I realized a <strong>Makefile</strong> would make more sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had <em>content</em> files and <em>resource</em> files (images, the LaTeX header, for
example)</li>
<li>I needed to generate intermediate files, such as the cover as a PDF from a PNG</li>
<li>Some formats (ePub) were used to create other formats (Kindle)</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a Makefile, I regenerated only the needed parts, based on which files were
updated since the latest build. I could run <code>make pdf</code>, <code>make epub</code>,
<code>make mobi</code>, or just <code>make</code> to generate all formats.</p>
<p>Here is the portion of my Makefile used to generate the <em>ePub</em> and <em>mobi</em>
(Kindle) files:</p>
<pre><code>BOOK_TITLE <span>=</span> A\ React\ Developer’s\ Guide\ to\ Hooks\ -\ Sebastien\ Castiel<p><span>epub</span><span>:</span> dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub<br>  <span>@</span>echo <span>'✅  ePub'</span></p><p><span>kindle</span><span>:</span> dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.mobi<br>  <span>@</span>echo ‘✅  Kindle’</p><p><span>dist/<span>$</span>{BOOK_TITLE}.epub</span><span>:</span> dist content/*.md images/* resources/dracula.theme resources/metadata.xml resources/epub.css<br>  <span>@</span>pandoc content/foreword.md content/ch*.md content/resources.md \<br>  --output<span>=</span>dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub \<br>  --highlight-style resources/dracula.theme \<br>  --standalone \<br>  --epub-metadata<span>=</span>resources/metadata.xml \<br>  -c resources/epub.css \<br>  --epub-cover-image<span>=</span>cover.png \<br>  --toc --toc-depth<span>=</span>1 \<br>  --metadata title<span>=</span><span>"A React Developer’s Guide to Hooks"</span></p><p><span>dist/<span>$</span>{BOOK_TITLE}.mobi</span><span>:</span> dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub<br>  <span>@</span>kindlegen dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub -o <span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.mobi &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</p></code></pre>
<p>Okay, maybe slightly overkill for my needs, but I felt so powerful! 💪🏻</p>
<p><em>You can find
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scastiel/4c409156ad4bc6a6dbbfe2abbd163671#file-makefile">here the complete Makefile</a>
for my book.</em></p>

<p>I embedded the examples’ source code in a small <strong>React</strong> application to run
them locally. The user can start it by running <code>yarn start</code> and navigate easily
through them.</p>
<p>Now, I feel a bit silly not to have thought of using
<a href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</a>, which could have been a perfect
solution.</p>

<p>I created the cover using Apple Pages, sufficient for what I wanted to do. I
should <s>probably</s> definitely hire someone to create a more professional one.</p>

<p>I often design graphics using <strong><a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a></strong> (for
example, the banner for the <a href="https://gum.co/use-hooks">Gumroad page</a>), even if
at the end I manipulate and generate bitmap images. I know it’s not its first
purpose, but I find it easier to use than Gimp or commercial alternatives.</p>
<p>If you know a better choice, please please please tell me!</p>

<p>From the beginning, I really wanted a custom presentation with a dark theme.</p>
<p>Now, I realize this wish took me a lot of extra time. And I would have preferred
spending that time on the content. Plus, I don’t know if the readers actually
like this theme or not…</p>
<p>Also, it may have been better to focus first on the <strong>web support</strong>.
<a href="https://v2.docusaurus.io/">Docusaurus</a> could do an excellent job: readers could
navigate the sections, search for keywords, etc.</p>
<p>The PDF or ePub version would be secondary content: available, but maybe with a
generic appearance. So what?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the end, if the user finds the content useful, shouldn’t it be all that
matters?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will probably consider this change soon. Plus, I’d like to create a <strong>course</strong>
(without video) from the book’s content…</p>
<p>Regarding the workflow with Pandoc, I’m quite satisfied with it. Writing using
Markdown is lovely to focus on the content without caring how it will render.
And since Markdown is text, it’s easy to keep track of the history using Git. 🙂</p>

<p>I like poker, but I’m better at chess.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png" alt="Poker vs chess" width="499" height="451" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-347x314.png 347w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-694x628.png 694w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-768x695.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-1536x1389.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px"></a></p>
<p>Poker can be a lot of fun if you have a witty enough group of friends and a generous snack budget. There’s nothing worse than playing poker with a bunch of serious gamblers who think conversation and choice of hot wing spiciness are potential tells.</p>
<p>I like chess because nothing is hidden. I don’t like leaving things to chance, and I’m often foolish enough to believe I can figure out how to win if I have all the information.</p>
<p>In chess, there are no missing pieces. There isn’t a sneaky queen that your opponent can place on the board when you least expect it. Everything is in the open. The strategy and tactics are entirely determined by what is sitting in front of you in plain sight.</p>
<p>If I try to play poker the way I play chess, I’m going to lose. I can’t see all the cards. Information is hidden from me, and it’s information I need to make the right decisions.</p>
<p>If you can’t stand the uncertainty of poker, don’t do a startup. Don’t do an innovation project.</p>
<p>Innovation is like poker.</p>

<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png" alt="A group of people playing poker" width="599" height="441" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-427x314.png 427w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-853x628.png 853w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-768x565.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-1536x1130.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>

<h2>The Rules of Startup Poker</h2>
<p>This is not an ordinary game of poker. (So don’t worry if you’re not a poker player, this will still make sense.) I will stretch the analogy of Texas Hold ‘Em as far as I can in this special variation of Startup Poker.</p>
<p>Each player needs to pay the ante to play. This is a cheap game, so we’ll keep the ante at $1. Those are the costs of running an innovation project.</p>
<p>Each player gets dealt two cards that they can keep hidden. These cards represent the organization’s unique capabilities and business model — what they already have when they start.</p>

<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png" alt="A group of people playing poker part 2" width="599" height="450" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-418x314.png 418w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-836x628.png 836w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-768x577.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-1536x1154.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>As a normal Texas Hold ‘Em game progresses, the dealer will turn over additional cards in the middle of the table, which each player can use as part of their hand. First there are the three cards called “the Flop,” which are turned over at the same time. Then a fourth card is turned, which is called “Fourth Street” or “The Turn.” The last card is “the River.” Players can place bets before each of these rounds, trying to raise the stakes and force other players to fold.</p>

<p>In Startup Poker, all these shared cards represent the Market. The first three cards are “the Early Adopters.” The fourth card is “the Early Majority” and the last is “the Late Majority.” As the game goes on, the Market matures and players discover if they hold the winning hand.</p>
<p>The winner of the game is the person who has the best fit between the cards in their hand (which represents their business model) and the cards on the table (the Market). We can think of this as Product / Market fit or Business Model / Market fit.</p>

<p>The basic setup is the same, but remember, we are not playing regular Texas Hold ‘Em. Our rules are a bit different.</p>
<h2>Information Costs Money</h2>
<p>In Startup Poker, players have to ante another $1 every round to stay in. This is the cost of product development. (For our purposes, we are eliminating the standard Hold’em practice of “blinds,” which is a form of uneven antes.).</p>
<p>Additionally, instead of every round beginning by flipping over Market cards, players can get a preview by paying an additional $1 for each card. (In real poker, everyone sees the flipped card, but in our version you’re paying for a sneak peek.)</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png" alt="A poker player peeking at a flipped card" width="699" height="514" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-427x314.png 427w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-853x628.png 853w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-768x565.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-1536x1130.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>This is the equivalent of funding an <a href="https://kromatic.com/workshops/building-and-resourcing-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="innovation team" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked">innovation team</a> to gather Market information. This investment isn’t really just money, it’s blood, sweat, and tears. But since people * time = money, we’ll just use our poker chips to represent this investment. The team is really going out into the real world, talking to customers, putting up a landing page, or running some other form of experiment or research to gather information.</p>
<p>At that point, they have the option to kill the idea (fold) or persevere before a round of betting.</p>
<p>Should we go straight ahead and bet on our hand? Or should we buy a peek at the Market first?</p>
<h2>Bet It All in Waterfall</h2>
<p>We could just close our eyes and bet it all on our pair of jacks. This is the equivalent of <a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/lean-startup-in-the-enterprise-anti-pattern-the-lean-waterfall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfall development</a>, where we place our bets and literally let the cards fall where they may.</p>
<p>We believe our cards are the correct ones for the Market, despite having not seen a single card from that Market. So we are placing a lot of faith in our business model and capabilities — our pair of jacks — and to be fair, that is a formidable hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png" alt="A player risking it all to bet in a poker game" width="599" height="405" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-465x314.png 465w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-929x628.png 929w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-768x519.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-1536x1038.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>But we’ve invested for the long hall, so we push it all in and check the snack bar while the hand plays out. But the Market isn’t kind. Our opponent starts with a 2 and a 4, but winds up closing a 2-6 straight with the 3, 5 and 6 from the Market. We lose to a weaker starting hand that ended up being better for that Market. We end up sitting in the corner binging on Pringles and lukewarm beer for the rest of the night while everyone else keeps playing, but that’s a risk of Waterfall.</p>
<h2>Information Has Value</h2>
<p>So instead of going all-in based on our business model and capabilities, should we buy that peek at the Market if we’re holding a pair of jacks?</p>
<p>The answer here is yes. Obviously so.</p>
<p>If everyone is sneaking a peek at the next card except you, you are at a huge disadvantage. Now they are playing chess because they can see more of the board. Meanwhile, you think you are still playing poker.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png" alt="A player playing chess blindfolded" width="512" height="565" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png 1812w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-285x314.png 285w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-569x628.png 569w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-768x847.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-1392x1536.png 1392w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></p>
<p>True, they still can’t see their opponents’ hole cards, so they don’t have all the information, but they have more than you.</p>
<p>So should you pay for the peek no matter what you are holding in your hand? Well, that depends on the cost.</p>
<h2>Don’t Play Every Hand</h2>
<p>If you start the game with a 2 of spades and a 9 of hearts, you have a bad hand. It’s not worth getting Market information because you are woefully unprepared for any Market. You might get lucky and find three twos on the board, but that’s a longshot. The odds are that someone else has a better hand. Just fold and play the next hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png" alt="2 Of spades and 9 of hearts" width="399" height="354" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-354x314.png 354w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-708x628.png 708w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-768x682.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-1536x1363.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px"></a></p>
<p>For large organizations, this is the equivalent of having an idea that is fundamentally mismatched with the company.</p>
<p>“Let’s make vegan hamburgers,” says the mining company.</p>
<p>This makes no sense. It is the 2/9 offsuit of business ideas. Let’s skip this idea and work on something with a little more promise.</p>
<h2>Pivoting</h2>
<p>In the real world, startups aren’t stuck with the cards that they are dealt. If something isn’t working with their business model, they can pivot.</p>
<p>You can also alter your product in Startup Poker, because after you peek at the cards on the board, we let you trade the cards in your hand — for a price. Each round, each player has the opportunity to trade in one card at a cost of $1. It’s an option to change your product / business model after you’ve gotten a taste of the market.</p>
<p>So let’s say you start with a pair of twos — one heart and one spade. You pay $3 to peek at three cards. They are the three, four, and five of hearts.</p>
<p>You might want to trade in your two of spades and get a new card from the deck, giving yourself a shot at a flush, a straight, or a straight flush.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png" alt="Early adopters vs business model" width="599" height="585" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-321x314.png 321w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-643x628.png 643w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-768x750.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-1536x1501.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>You are exercising an option to find a better fit with the Market. It’s only the information that you’ve gained by buying a peek at the Market that makes this pivot worthwhile.</p>
<h2>Arrogance</h2>
<p>Let’s face it, arrogance never helps in chess or in poker. Everytime I get cocky in chess, I lose.</p>
<p>Chess rankings are highly visible when playing. So when I relax for my lunchtime game and see that I’m playing someone with a rating 200 points below me, I know I’m going to win. Which is of course exactly when I’m going to lose.</p>
<p>I’m so confident in winning that I start checking my Slack messages while playing. Then I draft an email. Then I make some tea. I get distracted, forget my plan, and generally make a stupid mistake.</p>
<p>“Bad luck!” But there is no luck in chess — this is the folly of arrogance.</p>
<p>If we really wanted to make Startup Poker realistic, every player would be forced to drink 5 shots of bourbon before playing, then when they look at the two cards in their hand they’ll be convinced they have three of a kind. Every entrepreneur thinks they are the second coming of Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>Confidence is great. Good entrepreneurs don’t go into a market without some level of confidence. But arrogance allows your confidence to overrule your judgement.</p>
<h2>The Size of the Pot</h2>
<p>There’s another oddity to Startup Poker in that no one knows exactly how big the pot is. It is somewhat determined by the antes that people are paying in and the bets being made, but mostly it’s determined by the Market.</p>
<p>Of course, people can bet up the pot and force players to invest more to keep up. It’s the same as startups competing against each other. When one buys advertising, the others better match it or have a better strategy.</p>
<p>To calculate the value of the Market, we add up the value of the cards to determine the size of the pot (numbered cards are worth their face value, royal cards are worth $10, and aces are worth $15). So this makes buying Market information even more important.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png" alt="The size of the pot" width="699" height="356" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-600x306.png 600w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-1200x612.png 1200w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-768x391.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-1536x783.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>Don’t waste your money and time playing for a small pot.</p>
<h2>Crowded Markets</h2>
<p>Lastly, look at who is competing. It can be very compelling to play in a game with fewer people. Remember, the size of the prize is mostly determined by the Market, not the amount of competition. Unfortunately, in Startup Poker, players can join the game at any time.</p>
<p>When the dealer starts turning over Market cards, players who have not anteed up to that point can opt in. Of course at first they are at a disadvantage. They have missed at least one opportunity to get advanced information, and they’ve lost at least one opportunity to pivot. But they can still get into the Market — a Market that you’ve already invested in.</p>
<p>So if the first two cards the Market shows are a King and Jack, that’s $20 already in the pot. That might attract some latecomers to the game, and the competition might increase quickly.</p>

<p>Players who find themselves alone in a game at the early stages should still take advantage of the opportunity to get more information early, and to pivot if necessary. Even if …</p></div></div>

Using the <code>Entrypoint</code> and <code>Cmd</code> you discovered earlier, you can execute the intended startup command and see how the application is failing.</p><p>Depending on the container you’re running, it may be missing many of the tools necessary to debug your problem like: curl, lsof, vim; and if it’s someone else’s code, you probably don’t know which version of linux was used to create the image. We typically try all of the common package managers until we find the right one. Most containers these days use Alpine Linux (apk package manager) or a Debian, Ubuntu (apt-get package manager) based image. In some cases we’ve seen Centos and Fedora, which both use the yum package manager.</p><p>One of the following commands should work depending on the operating system:</p><ul><li><code>apk</code></li><li><code>apt-get</code></li><li><code>yum</code></li></ul><p>Dockerfile maintainers often remove the cache from the package manager to shrink the size of the image, so you may also need to run one of the following:</p><ul><li><code>apk update</code></li><li><code>apt-get update</code></li><li><code>yum makecache</code> </li></ul><p>Now you need to add the necessary tools to help with debugging. Depending on the package manager you found, use one of the following commands to add useful debugging tools:</p><ul><li><code>apt-get install -y curl vim procps inetutils-tools net-tools lsof</code></li><li><code>apk add curl vim procps net-tools lsof</code></li><li><code>yum install curl vim procps lsof</code></li></ul><p>At this point, it’s up to you to figure out the problem. You can edit files using vim to tweak the container until you understand what’s going on. If you forget all of the files you’ve touched on the container, you can alway kill the pod and the container will restart without your changes. Always remember to write down the steps taken to get the container working. You’ll want to use your notes to alter the Dockerfile or add commands to the container startup scripts. </p><h2 id="debugging-your-containers">Debugging Your Containers</h2><p>We have created a simple script to get all of the debuging tools, as long as you are working with a container that has curl pre-installed:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>/bin/sh -c </span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>curl</span><span> -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/releaseapp-io/container-debug/main/install.sh</span><span>)</span><span>"</span></p></pre></div><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we’ve learnt how to spot and investigate the CrashLoopBackOff errors in containers.

<p>Client, executives, and business owners always have one question at the start of a software project:</p>



<h4><em>“When will it be done?”</em><em></em></h4>



<p>If you’ve been working in software development for more than a month, you know this question is a trap.</p>



<p>Software development isn’t an assembly line where each task is measured down to the second. You’re creating a product that’s literally never existed before. There will always be uncertainty about the timeline.</p>



<p>Even so, software development is a business, so we have to accommodate the people we build software for.</p>



<p>They need the best estimate we can give them, and we need to avoid promising something we can’t deliver.</p>



<p>Which brings me to the focus of this article:</p>



<h4><em>How can I create an estimated timeline that my stakeholders will accept—but won’t lead to unrealistic deadlines for me and my team?</em><em></em></h4>



<h2>Ideal Days vs. Story Points: Two Common Methods</h2>



<p>GRAPHIC</p>



<p>In the quest to create better project estimates, developers have come up with all kinds of systems.</p>



<p>Two very common ones are:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Ideal days (or similar time-based estimates)</li><li>Story points</li></ol>



<p>Both can be used to create project timelines, and both have their pros and cons.</p>



<p>One method is reliable, data-driven, and stable.</p>



<p>The other?</p>



<p>You can make it work. But it’s a bit more like crossing your fingers and hoping for the best.</p>



<h2>1. Ideal Days: Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1259" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-scaled.jpg" alt="Ideal Days: Advantages and Disadvantages" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-300x148.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-1024x504.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-768x378.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-1536x756.jpg 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-2048x1008.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></figure>



<p>Here’s a simple definition of for the ideal days method of estimating work:</p>



<h4><em>Ideal days is an estimate of the number of days your team would take to complete a project if they worked on nothing else and had no interruptions.</em><em></em></h4>



<p>In this context, “interruptions” means anything that causes the team to stop work on the project, including team meetings, training, other projects, illness, etc.</p>



<p>For example, a team of three developers might estimate a total of 45 ideal days to complete a project. If they had no interruptions and worked on nothing else, that would be an estimated timeline of 15 days.</p>



<p>No team exists without at least <em>some</em>&nbsp;interruptions.</p>



<p>For that reason, many teams might estimate somewhere between 20 and 30 days in this situation, depending on how optimistic (or realistic) they are.</p>



<h3>Pros of Ideal Days</h3>



<p>There are two main pros to the ideal days method:</p>



<ul><li>It’s concrete and intuitive</li><li>Clients and outside stakeholders understand it immediately</li></ul>



<p>When you tell a client, “this project should take 20 days,” you don’t have to educate them about the process you’re using or a new idea. They already understand the concept of time estimates expressed in hours, days, or months.</p>



<p>In most cases, clients and outside stakeholders will ask for an estimate given in days, weeks, or months—which is the main reason the ideal days method is so popular.</p>



<h3>Cons of Ideal Days</h3>



<p>There are three major problems with the ideal days method:</p>



<ul><li>Human beings are scientifically proven to be outrageously bad at estimating how long things will take;</li><li>Ideal days are often calculated based on the ideal case scenario, not a data-backed review of actual work completed on similar projects;</li><li>In practice, software teams often miss their promise date when using the ideal days method.</li></ul>



<p>This is not news to developers, of course. It’s no secret that we’re all bad at estimating time.</p>



<p>Despite these drawbacks, though, ideal days remain a popular method of estimating time. That brings us to the other most popular method: Story points.</p>



<h2>2. Story Points: Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1270" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-scaled.jpg" alt="Story Points: Advantages and Disadvantages" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-300x149.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-1024x508.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-768x381.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-1536x762.jpg 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-2048x1016.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></figure>



<p>Here’s a definition of story points:</p>



<h4><em>Story points are an estimate of the effort—not time—required to complete a task within a larger project.</em><em></em></h4>



<p>As you probably know if you’re reading this article, the term “story points” comes from the idea of user stories, a key idea within Scrum and Agile project management methodologies.</p>



<p>If you’re creating a new report for small business owners, for example, your user story might say:</p>



<p><em>As a small business owner, I want a daily report of my revenue for the previous day.</em><em></em></p>



<p>Story points are the estimates of the effort it will take to build all the features needed to create the experience described in the user story.</p>



<h3>Story Points Use a Relative Scale</h3>



<p>Story points are often assigned using the Fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.) or some other relative scale.</p>



<p>We may not know <em>exactly</em>&nbsp;how big a task is, but we know that changing a background from blue to green might be a 1 while building a new drop-down menu might be a 3 by comparison.</p>



<h4><em>Importantly, you should </em><em>never, ever</em><em>&nbsp;mix story points with ideal days or any other time-based estimation method. That includes the common practice of pegging story points to a certain number of hours or days (e.g., “One story point = one day”).</em><em></em></h4>



<p>Doing so strips your team of the most powerful reason to use story points—increasing your velocity.</p>



<h2>Pros of Story Points</h2>



<p>High-performance software teams don’t operate at one speed.</p>



<p>Instead, as they work their way through a project, they find ways to do it better, faster, and with less waste.</p>



<p>That means two vitally important things for your team:</p>



<ul><li>After you’ve been through three sprints, you will have a <em>very</em>&nbsp;strong understanding of how fast the team is moving—its velocity;</li><li>The velocity will increase over time as the team finds new ways to complete the work faster and with less waste.</li></ul>



<p>For example, it may take your team five days to complete the first 100 points of a project.</p>



<p>If so, your <em>velocity</em>&nbsp;over that first week is 100.</p>



<h3>Story Points Example Estimate</h3>



<p>Say you’re using one-week sprints for a 1,000 point project.</p>



<p>After three sprints, the team completes 104, 109, and 117 story points, respectively.</p>



<p>That’s an average velocity of 110, which is very strong evidence of the team’s capacity for this particular project <em>even with</em>&nbsp;normal interruptions. This is in stark contrast to the ideal days method, which assumes no interruptions and no other priorities.</p>



<p>You can now go to your stakeholders and confidently report that the 1,000 point project should be complete in a total of nine weeks.</p>



<p>If your team is increasing its velocity as it works (as it should!) there is a very good chance you’ll be able to deliver the project <em>ahead</em>&nbsp;of your promised delivery date.</p>



<h2>The Cons of Story Points</h2>



<p>While story points have many advantages, there are a few downsides, including:</p>



<ul><li>Story points are abstract and difficult to understand;</li><li>You might not be able to make a good timeline estimate right at the outset of a new project;</li><li>You’ll have to work hard to educate clients about the method and communicate with them often about the team’s progress.</li></ul>



<p>The abstract nature of story points means you’ll have to work much harder at communicating with clients, executives, and outside stakeholders.</p>



<p>At the beginning of the project, they’ll want you to tell them <em>exactly</em>&nbsp;how long the project will take—along with how much it will cost.</p>



<p>And in truth, you won’t <em>really</em>&nbsp;have an accurate estimate for them. It will be three sprints before you have an accurate velocity number you can use to make a data-backed projection.</p>



<p>For that reason, your initial estimates will be more uncertain than your estimates once you get the team moving.</p>



<p>That issue will be a point of concern for many clients, salespeople, or executives. They’ll want a firm timeline <em>before</em>&nbsp;they approve the project.</p>



<p>Luckily, there’s a straightforward way to create high-quality initial estimates even before you have a data-backed velocity number.</p>



<h3>How to Create an Initial Delivery Estimate Using Story Points</h3>



<p>The good news is: initial estimates using the story point method aren’t any less uncertain than the ideal days method.</p>



<p>If your team has completed similar projects to the one being proposed, review the completed sprint boards, then use the velocity the team achieved on those projects as a starting point for your estimate.</p>



<p>This lets you create realistic, data-backed estimates for the timeline of your project, ones that will get more accurate as you begin the project and start completing the work.</p>



<p>As a bonus, if you review the completed sprint boards of similar projects with your client or stakeholders as you give them your initial estimate, it will make you look like you <em>really</em>&nbsp;know what you’re doing.</p>



<p>Data-driven methods have that effect on people. 🙂</p>



<h3>Story Points Create Better Outcomes</h3>



<p>Despite its downsides, we believe story points create better outcomes for everyone involved in software development, including:</p>



<ul><li>Fewer last-minute overtime or weekend work;</li><li>More on-time projects;</li><li>Happier clients;</li><li>Happier developers;</li><li>Less overtime and write-offs—which leads to more profitable projects.</li></ul>



<h2>Use Time Tracking with Story Points for Full Visibility Within Your Sprints</h2>



<p>Story points are awesome for scoping and planning work, and velocity (once you have a real number based on at least iterations) is the most accurate way we know to calculate project timelines.</p>



<p>Together, story points and velocity are the antidote to fussy clients who want to know: “How long will this take!?”</p>



<p>Internally, however, once you’re inside a sprint, story points leave a gap in your visibility to the work being completed.</p>



<p>For example, imagine your team sets 20 points of work for a two-week sprint.</p>



<p>In Scrum, you never move a task to “complete” until it’s fully complete—ready for the user to use.</p>



<p>Five days into a ten-day sprint, you might still have 20 points remaining as “unfinished” on the sprint board.</p>



<p>You’re halfway through the sprint, but you have no information about how it’s going. You have 20 points of work remaining, but will it take five days to complete as you planned? Three days? 15 days?</p>



<p>At this point in the sprint, you have no data to make that projection.</p>



<p>It’s a bit like waking up in the morning, looking at your clock, but the only data you see is the year. It’s useful to know what year we’re in, but it doesn’t tell you if you’re running …</p></div></div>

<p>The early 1990s were a great time to be a kid. There was the ever present threat of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_close_calls">nuclear annihilation</a>, we were constantly being reminded that <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094291/">Greed was Good</a>, and it marked the advent of truly portable computing.</p>

<p>Sure, laptops had been <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/03/08/the-1978-xerox-notetaker-the-first-computer-to-be-used-on-a-commercial-flight-xerox-vintagecomputing-history/">available for a while by that point</a> - albeit at a price which would financial cripple small countries - but the first part of the final decade of the 20th century saw the arrival of computing devices which would actually fit in your pocket.</p>

<p>There was a kid in every school whose Dad had been given one by his work, decided it was too complex, and who <em>palm</em>ed it off to their offspring in the misguided belief it would help them organise their busy juvenile lives.</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Series_3">Psion 3</a> had a keyboard and a screen. It had an address book, database software, contact managers, calculators, agendas, and world clocks - everything the high-powered 80's corporate executive could ever need to organise his high-powered 80s executive life.</p>

<p>To adolescents in the schoolyard, it had limited practical utility beyond being cool as hell - it could be flipped shut, and it could fit in your pocket.
</p>
<p>
Granted, owning one of these bad boys would not grant an amazing degree of popularity to the possessor, and the technological gap between the home and office computers of the day and the popular palmtops, meant that it would only ever be of limited utility.
</p>

<p>Regardless, the palmtop computers were so cool as to be ice cold, and I have long wanted one which could be genuinely useful, fill the gaps left wide open by even the best mobile phones, and perform as well as a desktop PC. I wanted a   <a href="https://cyberdeck.cafe/">cyberdeck.</a></p>

<p>This led to a spree of purchases of Linux-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbook">netbooks</a> and EeePCs in the early to mid 2000s - all of which were abandoned as underpowered, locked-down limited-use-case wastes of money not long after.</p>

<table>

<p>The dream of a cyberdeck died - or at least fell into a coma - until the Raspberry Pi came on the scene.</p>

<p>It was ultra-low power, tolerable performance, and cheap as chips. Pi-based Cyberdecks began appearing on reddit in the (incredibly long) run-up to the release of CDPR's <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.</p>
<p>I even made my <a href="https://www.cyberpunks.com/super-simple-dirt-cheap-diy-portable-raspberry-pi-laptop/">own, super cheap, super low-tech version</a> which was published on another site.</p>

</tbody></table>

<p>But the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Pi</a>, excellent though it is, is a little <em>too</em> low powered to be used as a daily driver. Yes, you can use it as your main machine, but you’ll soon feel that it’s lacking… something.</p>

<p>And so, up until yesterday, I was using a 14” Dell E7470 for my everyday work and play, and carrying a Linux powered Oneplus 3 as my phone and for my mobile computing needs. The Oneplus, running <a href="https://www.ubports.com/">Ubuntu Touch</a> is great if privacy is your main concern, but as pocket sized computing platform, it’s just not there.</p>

<p>And then yesterday morning I smashed the screen of my Dell. Disaster! I write for a living, I work from home and I have deadlines. The repair is going to cost around 80 quid if I do it myself, and I would be offline for over a week. If a similar disaster occurred under normal circumstances, I’d work from the local library, but due to the current pandemic, that isn’t really an option.</p>

<p>Chinese hardware company GPD advertises the <a href="https://amzn.to/3iOQEoH">P2 Max</a> as “The world’s smallest Ultrabook,” and it is. There was also one for sale less than a mile away from me.</p>

<p>Money changed hands (at a suitable social distance), and I took my new purchase home with me.</p>

<h4> What's in the box?</h4>

<p>It’s a hella small box, and in it is a hella small, gunmetal grey laptop. It’s of comparable size to one of the palmtops of old, and I can pretty much cover the whole thing with one of my hands.</p>

<p>Open the lid, and there is a keyboard will full-sized keys. Just not very many of them.</p>

<p>There’s the usual QWERTY layout, cursors, CAPS, and numericals - but there a few noticeable absences. Only one shift, Alt and Ctrl, for instance. This isn’t a big deal as one hand can easily span the entire keyboard. There are no function keys either. The mousepad is about as small as it can be while still being usable. Again that’s OK as this tiny GPD ‘ultrabook’ comes with a 10 point touchscreen, and most of the time I use a USB optical mouse anyway.</p>

<p><img src="https://thecrow.uk/assets/gpd_P2_max_is_tiny.png" alt="Honestly, it's really small!"></p>

<p>The device is powered by a standard Type C USB of the same type I use to charge my mobile, and in return, offers two Type A USB ports (one on each side), a micro HDMI port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It’s not the most expansive array of ports, but it keeps the size and weight down.</p>

<p>The screen itself is a work of wonder. At 8.9 inches, it can support resolutions of up to 2560 x 1600 px. That’s insane. No-one on Earth has eyesight good enough to comfortably read text that small for an extended period. Yes, it’s just about do-able, and the text itself is perfectly formed, but eyestrain will quickly become an issue. After spending an evening at 1920 x 180, I eventually set it to an easy 1440 x 900 px.</p>

<p>So, it’s a teeny tiny laptop with a great screen and a good keyboard, but is it an ultrabook?</p>

<p>GPD certainly thinks so - it’s the machine’s headline selling point. Personally, I’m not even sure what an Ultrabook even <em>is</em>, apart from being a somewhat flexible marketing term.</p>

<h4>Specs matter</h4>

<p>Earlier, I mentioned the netbooks i previously owned. They failed as proto-cyberdecks because they were just not up to the task of everyday computing. They weren’t even really up to the task of basic web browsing.</p>

<p>The GPD P2 Max is different. The model I now own came with a 512GB SSD, and a solid 16GB of DDR4 RAM. That’s pretty solid. The processor is an eighth gen Intel. On paper at least, it’s similar to my currently unwell Dell.</p>

<p>Windows 10 Home edition booted to desktop in a few seconds -long enough for me to verify the specs before installing my OS of choice.</p>

<p>The Ubuntu Linux install took around 10 minutes, and i3 wnt quickly on top of that. I was able to retrieve the conf files from my old machine over SSH, and just like that, I was home.</p>

<p>Yes, it took a few minutes to get used to the keyboard, and I kept banging my fingers into the touchscreen and acidentally stealing focus, but meh. A person gets used to these things.</p>

<h4>Performance</h4>

<p>The best way of judging the performance is to tell you exactly how I’m using the machine at the moment, and how I’ve used it in the single day since it’s been in my house.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m writing this article in Atom on Workspace 5.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>On workspace 1, I have three XFCE terminals open - running Bashtop, TaskWarrior, and an SSH to my Pi which is tailing my access logs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace two has a Firefox window with 27 open tabs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace three has another Firefox window with a dozen or so tabs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Workspaces one, two and three open automatically with their contents intact on boot.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace four has an incognito Firefox window, in which I’m doing research I probably won’t want to reference again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace six is running a <a href="https://thecrow.uk/why-does-this-site-look-like-crap-getting-used-to-life-with-jekyll/">Jekyll</a> local server in a terminal, automatically updating the preview of this article on workspace four.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace seven is running a script which periodically checks for comments on this blog and brings them to my attention.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Workspace eight, I have <a href="https://thecrow.uk/freelancing-in-a-time-of-quarantine-and-why-rss-is-the-greatest/">QuiteRSS</a>, checking for writing jobs on my behalf.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In workspace nine, I’m conducting a war of attrition against Matthias Corvinus of the Hungarian Empire in <em>Civilization VI</em>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Is the GPD P2 Max capable? Hell yes. I’m using it exactly how I used my old laptop. I’ve been playing games through Steam. I’ve been  Windows games using WINE. I’ve been productive and I’ve been having fun.</p>

<p>And when I’ve finished, I can pick it up and put it in my pocket. Even better, the screen is covered with Gorilla Glass 4, so the accident which happened to my Dell can never happen again.</p>

<p>It’s a cyberdeck.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>We have written a lot about the blind spot the US venture ecosystem has for <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2019/09/30/3042/">semiconductors</a> (<a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2020/08/10/not-a-drop-for-you/">and here</a>) and hardware more generally. We recently helped a venture firm conduct due diligence on an electronics company, which put us in the awkward position of having to walk in someone else’s shoes. Sympathy for the devil, and all that. In our posts we have attempted to be fair, pointing out that US VCs are making sensible economic decisions albeit on a short-sighted viewpoint. Investing in hardware is much more capital intensive and thus risky than investing in software. In this post, we want to work through some of the math behind that. </p>



<p>Let’s say we have a company, Unicorn Electronics, that wants to build The SmartHorn <sup>TM</sup>, a device that magically solves customers’ problems perfectly. How do we get the company to “escape velocity” – positive cashflow sufficient to fund the company’s immediate growth needs?</p>



<p>First, Unicorn needs to design the Horn. Depending on how complex the device is this can cost anywhere from $100,000 to $1 million, from a third party design shop. Some people can do this design themselves, others are going to need outside help. For our purposes, let’s say the Horn design costs $500,000. This amount gets the company the “blueprints” and a few prototypes.  </p>



<p>But most devices today are fairly complex. Even if the hard computation is done in the cloud or in the app, the device itself needs to be able to function, to be programmed and to communicate with the Internet. That means firmware. This is low-level software, and not only is their no standard “firmware” programming language or operating system, pretty much every chip company has its own instruction language. Hiring firmware engineers is not that expensive in dollars, but it can be very expensive in time. Here’s a typical scenario. The design shop hands the firmware designers some prototypes. The firmware team finds a bug that requires a new wire or capacitor. So the design firm has to build (by hand) a new prototype. The firmware team then finds that two of the chips are not speaking to each other – the Bluetooth and the temperature sensor for instance. Is the problem in one chip or the other or somewhere in the wiring in between? Often this will mean the design team needs to spin up yet another prototype. And since these teams are likely in different cities, if not different countries, every re-spin loses days in shipping and re-work. </p>



<p>So far, we have spent $500,000 and a month on the design, and $100,000 and four months on firmware.</p>



<p>Now we have to find a manufacturer. This company will need to create tools and molds as well as designing a manufacturing flow. They can do this fairly quickly, but as they are operating on expensive machine tools, they will have minimum quantity requirements. These can be as low as a few thousand units, but here is where the costs really start to add up. </p>



<p>Let’s say the SmartHorn costs $100 in parts and manufacturing, but the manufacturer requires a minimum of 5,000 units. Then the tricky part becomes sourcing parts. The global electronics supply chain is incredibly tight right now. <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2020/10/27/what-is-happening-to-the-supply-chain/">We wrote about this back in October</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/business/auto-factories-semiconductor-chips.html">New York Times was catching up last week</a>. Lead times for many parts can be several months, and frustratingly it is hard to predict with often some of the lowest value parts in the shortest supply. So add $500,000 (5,000 units X $100 BOM) and four months. </p>



<p>Then we enter into a whole sea of minutiae. The device will need various certifications UL, FCC, etc. Add $50,000, but fortunately this can be done while the manufacturing is ramping up. But there are bigger costs as well such as insurance. Most distributors (i.e. retail) and enterprise customers will want the company to maintain a range of insurance policies, tack on another $50,000 or so. Then we have to factor in shipping and customs and taxes, so maybe $20 per device. </p>



<p>Next up, the company has to factor in warranties and returns. The accountants have requirements for setting reserves for these, but a rough rule of thumb (sufficient for our purposes here only) is 10% of the costs of the materials needs to be set aside to cover the cost of returns and replacements. </p>



<p>Finally, the company has to contend with marketing. This amount can range from nothing to A Lot, depending on whether they are selling to consumers or to a single large enterprise customer. A basic PR budget and some content marketing runs about $50,000, plus or minus. </p>



<p>Adding this up we have the following budget:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Item</td><td>Amount</td><td data-align="center">Time</td></tr><tr><td>Design</td><td>$500,000</td><td data-align="center">1 Month</td></tr><tr><td>Firmware</td><td>$100,000</td><td data-align="center">4 Months</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacture</td><td>$500,000</td><td data-align="center">4 Months</td></tr><tr><td>Certification</td><td>$50,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>Insurance</td><td>$50,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>Shipping </td><td>$100,000</td><td data-align="center">1 Month</td></tr><tr><td>Marketing</td><td>$50,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>Sub-total Cost of Goods Sold</td><td>$1,350,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>Warranty Reserve</td><td>$135,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td><strong>TOTAL</strong></td><td><strong>$1,485,000</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>9 Months</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>All of this has to take place before the company can collect any revenue, unless they have done some form of crowdsourcing. So just to break even the company has to charge $297/unit, and to get a 50% gross margin the retail price would need to be $594. </p>



<p>We also need to factor in software costs. For this example, we will assume Unicorn Electronics does their own app and back-end software. The company could probably build all of the hardware and software with a team of ten people. If the average salary is $150,000 year (assume some expensive onshore talent and some less expensive offshore talent), the total comes out to $1.5 million for a year. </p>



<p>So $1.485 million in hardware costs and $1.5 million for headcount, for a total of $2.985 million. The company then sells 5,000 units for $594 a piece or $2.97 million in revenue and yielding a net <em><strong>loss</strong></em> of ($15,000). Hardware can be dispiriting.</p>



<p>The good news is that there is a heavy fixed costs component to this model, so tweaking a few variables can have a big impact. For instance, if they raise prices by $6/unit to an even $600, the net profit goes to $15,000 (positive). Sell an additional 1,000 units and the net profits are close to half a million dollars. If they sell 100,000 units then the company has a path to becoming a true Unicorn. There is a lot of leverage in the model, which is why people keep trying to build hardware. </p>



<p>That being said, the realities of hardware can be daunting. Take the $3 million the company needs to get a product out the door, a similarly sized team could build a software application that can potentially grow much faster and they would still have a million dollars to do customer acquisition. Compounding this, the software would come with a recurring revenue stream. The trouble with hardware is that for the company to grow, they have to come out with the Smart Horn 2 and the Smart Horn 3, and go through all of the above again, and again. </p>



<p>Hardware has immense financial leverage, but the upfront costs and more crucially the time required are daunting. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><figure><div></div></figure><section><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><a href="https://rudderstack.com/blog/the-complete-customer-data-stack/">Your data warehouse is the platform your customer data stack is built on</a>. It acts as a robust central system for driving critical business decisions while maintaining a unified source of truth for your entire organization. Businesses are constantly looking to improve their product or marketing strategies to get an extra edge over their competitors. Data warehouses help you get that competitive edge by serving analytical data to make fact-based decisions that drive innovation and business growth. While teams turn those analysis-driven insights into strategies and tactics, it’s tough to activate the warehouse’s actual data that the insights are based on.</p>
<p>To make it easier to utilize and activate all of the analytics your teams build, we’re launching a new feature called RudderStack Warehouse Actions. Warehouse Actions enables you to leverage processed customer data stored in your data warehouse and directly route this enriched information to your entire customer data stack.</p>
<p>In this post, we detail Warehouse Actions. We explain how configuring your warehouse as a data source can fully unlock your data’s value, how Warehouse Actions works, some of its benefits, and how to set it up in RudderStack.</p>
<div> <p> <iframe title="" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iafB9gyoWtc?rel=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p> </div>
<h2>Why Warehouse Actions?</h2>
<p>Data warehouses are an indispensable tool as they enable decision-makers to access data quickly through business intelligence tools, SQL clients, and other analytical applications. Without a data warehouse in place, you are forced to rely on the individual (siloed) applications you use and the raw data from each for analysis. </p>
<p>A warehouse helps guarantee that your data is unified, consistent, and high-quality by eliminating duplicate records, errors, and inconsistent information. It also enables your teams to perform deep analysis and modeling on your data, something that is nearly impossible without a warehouse.  Given the quality of the data in your warehouse and your teams’ can derive from it, it makes sense to use the customer data in your warehouse to activate your customer tools. </p>
<p>Warehouse Actions makes feeding customer insights into your customer data pipelines easy by turning tables into event streams that can trigger activation in your downstream customer tools. </p>

<p>RudderStack makes it easy to collect data from different sources, event and non-event, and securely ingest them into your warehouse. Once data is successfully ingested, your teams can then apply advanced queries or models to generate valuable data composites (either tables or views) that are frequently materialized (aka written) as their tables and stored in your data warehouse. For example, <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt</a> can be used to transform data within your warehouses by simply writing select statements. dbt turns these select statements into tables and views.</p>
<p>With Warehouse Actions, any updates to the analytics-derived datasets that live in your warehouse can be collected by RudderStack and pushed as events to all of your customer tools.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Using a Warehouse Actions</h2>
<p>Even if collected and unified across multiple touchpoints, customer event data may lack the necessary information to build complete or enriched customer profiles. Event data alone doesn’t give context into any of the information stored in your customer master data, campaign data, or even your advertising data. When you have data from sources beyond events that could make your customer profiles better or enable deeper, more meaningful analysis, you need a data warehouse. Your warehouse is where you can combine all of these different types of customer data to define better customer profiles and derive more meaningful insights from more in-depth analysis. With Warehouse Actions, you can route the customer insights in your data warehouse to third-party tools for further activation. </p>
<p>For example, when running a new marketing campaign, you are often challenged with gathering the “right data” for personalized emails,  push notifications, or targeted audiences. This “right data” often starts with simple data, such as name and email address, and then expands to complex customer data, including behavioral traits, products viewed, subscriptions enrolled, and so on. All of the data you need to make the “right data” is either already in your data warehouse or easily could be. </p>
<p>Warehouse Actions lets you action on the “right data”, routing the outputs of your team’s analysis to all of your customer tools. As a result, it is significantly easier to help your marketing teams build and automate things like customized recommendations for campaigns. Also, it allows your product team to build win-back flows for users likely to churn. </p>

<p>We will use a real-world example to walk through how to set up Warehouse Actions. Let’s say your company wants to use the number of log-ins over seven days to calculate a lead score for new users. Multiple log-ins will increase the lead score. </p>
<p>Let’s also say that because you use RudderStack Event Stream and RudderStack Cloud Extract, you have the log-in event data from your website, iOS app, and Android app, as well as the lead records from Salesforce in your warehouse. You can use SQL (or another method of querying the data) to build a simple model for calculating each lead score. The result is a table in your warehouse that lists Salesforce leads and their associated score. </p>
<p>In Snowflake, the query to calculate lead score and produce a table might look something like this: </p>

<p>With Warehouse Actions, you can easily pull the updated lead profiles from the table in Snowflake back through RudderStack and send them to Salesforce, meaning your sales team will have the most up-to-date status on new signups. Because the table is translated into an event stream, you can also route it to any other tools that need the lead score, like marketing automation and customer experience platforms. </p>
<p>Configuring Warehouse Actions is simple and only takes a few minutes.</p>

<h2>Pachyderm Uses Warehouse Actions to Automate Their Onboarding E-mails</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.pachyderm.com/">Pachyderm</a>, an enterprise-grade, open-source data science platform, implemented Warehouse Actions for lead qualification. After creating an account, the first action Pachyderm wants their customers to do is create a workspace. They encourage users to do this in a series of drip emails sent through <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/">HubSpot</a>, but they don’t want these drip emails to go out to customers that have already created a workspace. This data is already in their data warehouse, and now, with Warehouse Actions, they can automatically exclude these customers from this drip email series.</p>

    <p>2021-01-26 08:59:23+00:00</p>
    <p><a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">Wayland</a> is the “new” (13 years old already) display server technology on Linux, which is supposed to replace
the antiquated X11. It promises better security, performance, portability, everything, compared to X11, and
it sure does deliver, provided that you’re not using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/">unsupported graphics cards</a>.
You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIctzAQOe44">this talk / rant about X11</a> to get an idea about how bad it is.</p>

<p>Some power users also haven’t switched to Wayland because their window manager doesn’t have a
Wayland equivalent (XMonad, Awesome, Bspwm and the others, all having their unique feature-set). Some may wonder “hmm maybe I can port it myself”. I wrote this post to make you (re)consider that.</p>

<p>One of the main ideas of Wayland is that it’s merely a specialised IPC protocol, and the communication is
strictly between the clients (applications on your screen mainly) and the server.</p>

<p>The server is what we are interested in now. Unlike X11, where the server is X.Org and the window manager
is just an X11 client with special privileges, on Wayland the window manager is also a server and a compositor. In fact, the correct terminology is “Wayland compositor”. This piece of software has the
task of doing everything it wants with the clients, which is usually among the lines of showing them
on the screen and giving them inputs events from your keyboards, mice, touchscreens etc. In fact, <a href="https://mir-server.io/">no one
stops you from leaving window management as an API</a>.</p>

<p>On my laptop, I prefer using GNOME under Wayland, because it has the most stable, fully-featured and “just works”
experience there is. However, I wanted a better way of organising windows on my screen than leaving them
shuffled around. Tiling was also not good, because every time you launch a new window, the others get
shrunk to fit, which is not good on a small laptop display.</p>

<p>Luckily I discovered <a href="https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM">PaperWM</a>. It’s perfect for laptops, instead of
shrinking your windows, it just renders them off-screen. To switch between one or the other you can just
flick three fingers on the touchpad. It’s great. It’s also “glossy” and polished and has great UI and animations.</p>

<p>It has some disadvantages though, mainly concerning its speed. I find it sluggish, and it’s no surprise that
like all other GNOME Shell extensions, it’s a JavaScript behemoth. PaperWM still uses the GNOME Tweener
framework for its animations, which is entirely written in JS. Because of that, it needs to communicate with the main
GNOME compositor process on each operation. And because we’re talking animations, said operations happen
for <em>every frame</em>. That means there is JS executed for every frame, 60 times a second. It’s horrible!</p>

<p>BTW nowadays GNOME uses animations implemented in C (since GNOME 3.34), the “GNOME runs JS on every frame” statement is for the most part false today.</p>

<p>Because of the inefficiency of PaperWM, it also means that it drains my battery quickly, which is bad for a laptop!</p>

<p>So, because I am a student with a lot of free time, together with <a href="https://alexge50.com/">Alex</a> we figured we shall develop a scrollable tiling (PaperWM-like) Wayland compositor. It’s called <a href="https://gitlab.com/cardboardwm/cardboard">Cardboard</a> (get it??). It also has the nicety of
being controlled and configured by a remote control program, like bspwm.
Neither Alex nor I had experience with any kind of Wayland development. However, I wrote <a href="https://tudorr.ro/software/windowchef/">an X11 window manager</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/tudurom/disputils/">some XRandR querying utilities</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tudurom/ruler">a window rule daemon</a>. Alex has experience
with <a href="https://git.alexge50.com/a/gie">graphics programming</a> and <a href="https://github.com/alexge50/libwatchpoint">C++ devilry</a>.</p>

<p>Our “tech stack” was <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots">wlroots</a>, which is an exceptional Wayland compositor library (apart from its lack of documentation). The description from the README is spot on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>About 50,000 lines of code you were going to write anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I (because I wrote most of the Wayland-interfacing code) realised soon that there is still a lot of boilerplate involved in writing a compositor, much more than for an X11 window manager,
namely setting up your own rendering code, registering and storing input devices and screens in your own data structures, passing input events to windows, calculating bounds for bars
and other overlays (courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlr-protocols/blob/master/unstable/wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1.xml"><code>layer-shell</code></a>) and others. X11 handles all of this for you,
the window manager just reacts to events regarding window inputs to establish its behaviour. With Wayland, you handle everything, even with wlroots. The upside is that if you don’t like the way X11 does something
(which is a given), not only that you can do it in your own way on Wayland, you are required to do so.</p>

<p>Because we weren’t really prepared for what writing a compositor involved, we thought that it must be approached like a “normal” program: split code into modules, each with their own responsibilities, call wlroots to do its thing, the usual stuff.
We are writing a program in our way and wlroots lets us “interface with Wayland”. Or so we thought.</p>

<p>We were as careful as possible to separate responsibilities into different structures / classes, yet we ended up with most functions taking a pointer to <code>Server</code> as their first parameter.
<code>Server</code> is a singleton holding all the other “sub-modules” in it. It represents the compositor itself. The reason most functions need <code>Server</code> is that everything is related to everything,
not because of a mistake in structuring the code, but by design. This is what a compositor requires, the problem of writing a compositor is somewhat complex because it has a great deal variables ranging
from input events, drawing on the screen, creating behaviours that the user leverages, reacting to application events. All of them can affect the other, you can not separate the thing into modules.
The best you can do is separate the code in different files and folders based on some criteria, like grouping data structures with related routines.</p>

<p>As an example, let’s take damage tracking. For starters, because the compositor is also tasked with rendering the content and displaying it on the screen, we have some rendering code that runs on every frame.
Damage tracking is tracking which areas of the screen have changed in an amount of time. An example would
be typing a letter in the terminal. The place where the cursor is changes to the letter you typed, and the cursor advances.
If there is no change, the frame is not rendered, as it would look
exactly the same as the previous one, which would be a waste of processor time.
This way, instead of re-rendering everything 60 times a second (I assume that you use a common display), we can render and paint as little as possible to account for the changed region.
You can read <a href="https://emersion.fr/blog/2019/intro-to-damage-tracking/">an introduction to damage tracking</a> written by one of the main developers of wlroots.</p>

<p>I have just implemented the most basic form of damage tracking: do not render the frame if nothing on the screen changes.
It doesn’t track the damage itself, just that it exists.
To do this, I first added a <code>wlr_output_damage</code> object to my <code>Output</code> structure:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct Output {
</span>    struct wlr_output* wlr_output;
    struct wlr_output_damage* wlr_output_damage;
<span>+   struct wlr_box usable_area;
</span>    ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This structure tracks the damage accumulated per-output, as rendering is also per-output (this means that you can use screens of different refresh rates, yay!). However, to make this initial attempt at
damage tracking easier, I decided to trigger rendering for all attached outputs. I added a <code>set_dirty()</code> function to the <code>OutputManager</code> class that does just that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>OutputManager</span><span>::</span><span>set_dirty</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>auto</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>output</span> <span>:</span> <span>outputs</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>wlr_output_damage_add_whole</span><span>(</span><span>output</span><span>.</span><span>wlr_output_damage</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This marks every output as entirely damaged, and as such triggers a render.</p>

<p>With this function set into place, I had to identify when does the “screen” change, namely when a window “commits” (changes its contents) and when a window is moved. The window move is one example
of the way everything is related to everything in the …</p></article></div>

    <p>You may have heard that TypeScript has been taking the web development space by storm in the <a href="https://2018.stateofjs.com/javascript-flavors/typescript/">last</a> <a href="https://2019.stateofjs.com/javascript-flavors/typescript/">few</a> <a href="https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/technologies/javascript-flavors/">years</a>, bringing to it static types. I believe the same thing is starting to happen in the world of Python, where type checkers like <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a>,  <a href="https://pyre-check.org/">Pyre</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/pyright">Pyright</a> are increasingly used, at least where Python is used by companies to write large systems.</p>

<p>For the last several releases of Python, there have been an increasing number of type checking features added to each release by various PEPs:</p>




<p>The traffic on <a href="https://mail.python.org/archives/list/typing-sig@python.org/">typing-sig</a>, the mailing list where most major new typing features are proposed and designed, has also been seeing increasing traffic year over year.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I personally have found type checking to be very useful when working on large Python applications<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. It helps me find numerous small errors that are introduced during regular development<!-- such as import errors-->. Sure, most of these errors would be caught by the automated tests that I write for each new feature anyway<!-- TODO: footnote+link to TDD or similar practice? -->, but the type checker can find a whole bunch of errors all at once without even running the program, which decreases cycle times when adding new features:</p>

<p>Without type checking I tend to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a bunch of new code.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat 4-6 times, in rapid succession:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Run program to manually test.</li>
<li>Find basic error (like a missing import).</li>
<li>Fix basic error.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Debug/fix deeper errors in the new code.</li>
</ul>


<p>But <em>with</em> type checking I can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a bunch of new code.</li>
<li><strong>Run the type checker. Get a report of 4-6 basic errors. Fix basic errors immediately.</strong></li>
<li>Debug/fix deeper errors in the new code.</li>
</ul>


<p>I appreciate this increased productivity that type checking gives me when working on large programs. And I hope that more Python users try type checking for themselves, especially as Python gains an increasing number of related features in recent releases. It’s an exciting time to be a Python developer!</p>

Definitely!</p><p>Rust has multiple extremely fast web frameworks – Rocket, Actix Web, and Yew – and you can use the one that matches your needs and preferences.</p><h3 id="rocket">Rocket</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket">Rocket</a> is the most accessible web framework in the Rust ecosystem for beginners. It is highly customizable and helps you kickstart a new application quickly. At the same time, it avoids a lot of unnecessary boilerplate. Rocket also has many features included, which means that you won’t need to go far from the framework to build everything you need.</p><p>In contrast to Actix Web, the framework runs on nightly Rust – the “experimental” version of the language.</p><h3 id="actix-web">Actix Web</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/actix/actix-web">Actix Web</a> is usually thought to be more performant and stable than Rocket. Underneath, it works with the actor model used in <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/introduction-to-erlang#process-oriented">Erlang</a> and <a href="https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/actors.html">Akka</a>.</p><p>In contrast to Rocket, it’s less “batteries included”, meaning that you will most likely need to use third-party libraries for extra functionality.</p><h3 id="yew">Yew</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/yewstack/yew">Yew</a> is a Rust framework for creating web apps with WebAssembly. Among its main benefits, it lists a component-based framework like in React and Elm, outstanding performance because of the multi-thread support, and JavaScript interoperability.</p><p>As of now, it is not production-ready but should be an excellent choice for side projects and internal tooling, especially if you want to work with WASM.</p><h3 id="zola">Zola</h3><p>If you need something quick and simple to serve a static website, <a href="https://github.com/getzola/zola">Zola</a> is a fantastic tool to create fast and scalable web pages without any other dependencies or JS bloat.</p><h3 id="warp">Warp</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp">Warp</a> is a web server framework written in Rust. In comparison to Rocket and Actix, it is rather slim for a web framework and will provide you only with basic functionality out of the box.</p><h2 id="game-development">Game development</h2><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/cu/cubf89sc.2_(36)_(1).jpg" alt="Rust game development" loading="lazy"></p><p>Rust is exceptional for game development for the same reason that C++ is: it is predictably performant. Here are some of the engines you can use to build your own Rust game.</p><h3 id="bevy">Bevy</h3><p>Two of the main Rust game engines are Bevy and Amethyst. Among them, <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">Bevy</a> is the newer and cooler one. It is a simple, data-driven engine and can essentially be called Amethyst 2.0 since it is heavily inspired by it.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qjc0V58lB7A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>For more info on Bevy, you can check out the <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/introduction/">Bevy book</a>.</p><h3 id="amethyst">Amethyst</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst">Amethyst</a> is the more mature one of the two and, because of that, has more features that you might need for a large-scale project and better integrations with 3rd party libraries. But, Bevy is catching up fast. If you are searching for an engine for your new project, I’d recommend looking at them both and seeing which one you like better.</p><h3 id="ggez">ggez</h3><p>If you are searching for something simple to start off, <a href="https://github.com/ggez/ggez">ggez</a> is a lightweight cross-platform game framework for making 2D games with minimal friction.</p><hr><p>If you want to read more on game development in Rust, check out <a href="https://arewegameyet.rs/">Are we game yet?</a></p><h2 id="operating-systems">Operating systems</h2><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/zd/zdu35vif.3_(34)_(1).jpg" alt="Rust operating systems" loading="lazy"></p><p>Rust is an excellent alternative to C in operating system development since it offers the same level of performance while taking care of memory safety.

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607550167012_219370"><div><p>Today a lot of valuable digital construction data (BIM data and beyond) is locked up in closed proprietary data formats which are bound to aging software packages developed by a single software vendor. As a result, stakeholders in the construction process (e.g. contractors, sub-contractors, estimators, specification writers, owners, facility managers, etc.) are unable to fully leverage the BIM data to make better decisions or optimize their processes. Some of the negative results are miscommunication and misunderstanding between stakeholders, inaccurate estimation, change orders, scheduling and planning conflicts, errors in constructability, and so on.</p><p>Two decades ago, it was common practice for data formats to be only read and written by a single piece of software, on a single platform. This is no longer adequate.</p><p>As the internet has grown in importance, and as computing devices have become more specialized, well-designed open data exchange formats such as PDF, HTML, JPEG, MP3, MP4, and XML have become crucial to the effective exchange of data.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607550167012_228680"><div><p>So what is an open format, why is it good for the construction industry? First, according to Wikipedia:</p><blockquote><p><em>An open format is a file format for storing digital data, defined by a published specification usually maintained by a standards organization, and which can be used and implemented by anyone. For example, an open format can be implemented by both proprietary and free and open-source software, using the typical software licenses used by each. In contrast to open formats, closed formats are considered trade secrets.</em></p></blockquote></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606975570419_24188"><p><h3>Open Formats are Good for Customers</h3></p></div></div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607435564498_23818"><div><p><em>As a customer, it is risky to build a dependency on technology based on a single vendor’s closed format. </em>Users place themselves entirely at the mercy of one business: their pricing, tooling, and support. This has proven to be a real problem for customers that have their data locked up behind a walled garden that they must pay exorbitant amounts of money to have limited access to it.</p><p>This is a relic of an older business model from the time when most computing was done in isolation on a single machine.

We carefully evaluated many different file formats before starting our journey. The four primary contenders for 3D BIM interchange into real-time which we evaluated were: FBX, glTF, USD, and IFC.</h3></p></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606976253291_13454"><p><a href="https://help.autodesk.com/view/FBX/2020/ENU/%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0"><strong>FBX</strong></a><strong> (FilmBox File Format)</strong> is a widely used file format originally from Kaydara and is now owned and maintained by Autodesk. It has become the default asset transmission format in the games industry. Even though FBX has a free SDK, it is not open format. Reading and writing FBX files requires the binary SDK and it cannot be ported to web-browsers. FBX was originally designed for animation data. It does not do a good job of conveying the semantics of BIM data and is inefficient at handling large geometry.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606976375619_14778"><p><a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/specification/2.0"><strong>glTF</strong></a><strong> (GL Transmission Format)</strong> is an open data exchange format for 3D geometry and animation data that was designed specifically for WebGL. The glTF format is a difficult specification to fully support (for reading and writing) and requires custom extensions to support BIM data and geometry data channels beyond a limited initial set.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606976477826_42054"><p><a href="https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/index.html%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0"><strong>USD</strong></a><strong> (Universal Scene Description)</strong> is a framework for authoring and rendering 3D scenes composed from multiple sources.

IFC was started in 1994 by a consortium of 12 companies led by <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/">Autodesk</a>.</p><p>IFC was designed to express parametric surfaces and solids and their associated BIM data. This means that to make a rendering, the parametric surfaces and solids must go through a very lengthy conversion process into a triangular representation appropriate for rendering by the GPU (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">Graphical Processing Unit</a>). The GPU specializes in drawing lists of triangles very quickly. The conversion of a parametric surface to a triangular format is called “triangulation” or “tessellation”.</p><p>The process of triangulating complex intersecting parametric surfaces is very time consuming for a computer, and hard to do correctly. It requires a specialized library, called a geometry kernel. With the goal of reducing the time required to display the geometry, this made IFC unacceptably inefficient for us.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606976621178_36617"><p><h3>Our Findings Left Us Searching for More Answers</h3></p></div></div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606976943187_17825"><p>We found that these formats required too much complexity to parse large scale BIM projects correctly and efficiently on low-power devices, and they had no built-in mechanism to carry the structured BIM data.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remote work is trending. But the remote revolution started long before the pandemic and will stay powerful even after the hype subsides. As with any change, how well you adapt and improve will determine whether you get the better of remote work or run back to offices once the external factors go away.</p> <p>I decided to go remote 3 years ago and I'm glad I did. My last workplace was BriteCore, a remote-first company based in the US. And tomorrow, I'll be joining Doist, a pioneer in the world of remote work. I have gone through a lot of interview processes in the recent years.</p> <p>This article is an attempt to answer the why, what and how of remote work. The intended primary audience are developers from developing countries like me (I'm from Bangladesh) who do not want to relocate right now but wants to work on exciting products and teams all over the world. The general ideas apply to all professions that can be carried out remotely and to professionals anywhere in the world.</p> <h2 id="why-remote"> Why Remote</h2> <h3 id="better-opportunities"> Better Opportunities</h3> <p>Going remote means your employment is not limited to your physical location anymore. That opens up a world of opportunities. You can work for your dream company or with the colleagues and experts that you cherish. And all of it while staying in the place you like with the people you love. If you are the nomad type, this gives you great flexibility.</p> <h3 id="better-financial-gain"> Better Financial Gain</h3> <p>💵 Remote work opens up much better opportunities with much better compensations if you're, like me, living in a developing country. The compensations are generally much better than the local industry.</p> <p>📈 The high exchange rates between the powerful currencies and the local ones allow you to leverage the asymmetry and save much more. In fact, you can end up with a higher net savings per month than someone earning more than you in expensive places like San Francisco or London for example.</p> <p>📉 Tax rates are also generally lower and most developing countries have generous rebates if you're bringing in foreign remittance.</p> <p>✅ Even if you're living in a developed country, remote work saves you a good amount from commute, lunch and everything in between that comes with showing up in an office.</p> <h3 id="better-self-actualization"> Better Self-actualization</h3> <p>Remote work allows you to do deep work and puts you in control of your routine and interruptions. In a world of constant connectivity, the option to go deep as needed can give you an unfair advantage in knowledge based work that reward craftsmanship and superior skills. Read the interesting book titled <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep Work by Cal Newport</a> to learn more about this.</p> <h2 id="the-remote-skillset"> The Remote Skillset</h2> <p>Remote work comes with its share of challenges. You need to adapt and overcome these challenges to thrive in a remote work environment for the long term. And the process starts with adopting the remote skillset.</p> <p>I use a handy mnemonic  to summarise the skillset essential for remote work. I call it the <strong>IBM CI</strong>. IBM, as you probably know, is the name of a famous company and CI or <em>Continuous Integration</em> is a term developers are quite familiar with.</p> <p>The mnemonic comes from <strong>I</strong>ndependence, <strong>B</strong>alance, <strong>M</strong>astery, <strong>C</strong>ommunication and <strong>I</strong>mpact. I borrowed it from <a href="https://doist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doist</a>. So, all credit goes to the awesome team there. I just came up with the mnemonic to remember it better. You can find it in any of their job descriptions. Their <a href="https://blog.doist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a> is chalk-full of great articles on remote work. Subscribe to the blog to get the best out of it.</p> <p>I'll only touch on two aspects that encompass everything else.</p> <p><strong>Manager of One</strong>: Going remote means you're unlikely to have colleagues by your side. If you're working from home, it can be quite a challenge to put a boundary between work and non-work time. You're in charge of yourself and your schedule. So, you need to be able to do it well if you want to succeed in remote work in the long term.</p> <p>I borrowed the term <em>Manager of One</em> from Basecamp, a pioneer and advocate of remote work. The ability to manage yourself is pivotal to a successful remote career. Read more about it on Basecamp's <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> on the topic.</p> <p><strong>Communication</strong>: Bulk of the communication in remote work happens in the written medium. You need to harness your ability to express your thoughts and ideas clearly in the written form to thrive in a remote setting. This is also going to be the primary mode of making connections with colleagues across the company. You don't need to become a literary genius though. Clear and concise technical writing goes a long way. <a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1208930197702995968" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This tweet </a>sums up a  lot of great points.</p> <p>The tone gets lost in transmission in written medium. It's always good to pay extra attention to not come off harsh. Warm your messages with emojis 😃</p> <p>Most remote settings will have a diverse workforce. It's important that you stay sensitive to cultural diversities and refrain from saying anything that may be acceptable in your culture but not in others. Avoid using swear or curse words in all settings even if you deem it to be informal. I have had a manager in the past who would use the f-word in meetings. Please don't!</p> <p>As for technical skills, I advice to work on-site when starting out if possible. Most remote jobs expect you to do your job with minimal supervision. It's easier to find jobs and perform better when you have some experience under your belt.</p>  <p>Remote work means managing yourself well. Most of your communication will happen online and it is expected that you'll be using a lot of collaboration tools. Here are some of my suggestions to organise yourself better and produce quality output.</p> <p>📝 Use a task management tool. Put all your tasks as they pop up in your list and plan them accordingly. I use <a href="https://todoist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Todoist</a> for this but any tool that you're comfortable with works, even pen and paper.</p> <p>📓 Use an app for writing and taking notes. I prefer <a href="https://ia.net/writer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iA writer</a> for long documents and <a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evernote</a> for quick notes synced across devices. But again, anything that you're comfortable with works fine.</p> <p>🛠 Familiarise yourself with communication tools like Slack, Teams, etc if not already. Most companies use one for communication. While there's not much of a learning curve, you should at least know that they exist. Same for project management tools like Jira, Trello and so on.</p> <h2 id="shades-of-remote"> Shades of Remote</h2> <p>This section is more focused on developer jobs. Remote work can mean a lot of things for a developer. It can be consulting, freelancing, working for steady clients or full time contracts with companies. I'll categorise them in 3 buckets and list some resources where you can find opportunities for that category.</p> <h3 id="freelancing-platforms"> Freelancing Platforms</h3> <p>You can freelance on projects remotely on freelancing platforms. Examples include Upwork, Freelancer, etc where you can join, create a profile and start bidding on projects.</p> <p>While this is a good option to work on projects you're interested in, I tend to prefer not working on them as a career choice. All clients are not the same, so it needs a lot of calibration every time you start a new project.</p> <p>Clients generally choose these platforms for cost optimisation. So, the engineering standards are generally a bit lower and the deadline pressures are more intense.</p> <p>This also means variable workload and variable income, which makes planning your time and life harder. But I have worked on projects intermittently on Upwork before and it can be a good path to pursue if it suits you.</p> <p>Here's a list of popular freelancing platforms:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.upwork.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upwork</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.fiverr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fiverr</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.freelancer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Freelancer</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.guru.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guru</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.peopleperhour.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peopleperhour</a></li></ul> <h3 id="agency-platforms"> Agency Platforms</h3> <p>Some platforms employ a vetting process and only allow successful candidates on their platforms. For the lack of a better word, I call them agency platforms. These platforms are on the rise and I see new ones every now and then.</p> <p>Once you're on the platform, you may have to bid for projects again or you may be paired with companies depending on the type of the platform. But you'll be working as a member of the platform and the platform will take a cut off your earnings.</p> <p>One major downside of both these types of platforms is that you don't get any paid time offs (PTO). If you don't work, you don't get paid. You don't get any other perks or benefits either. But once you get yourself on these platforms, it may be easier to land clients or contracts (and better ones) than on platforms mentioned in the first category. Remember to check reviews before joining. Do not join if you don't like their practices.</p> <p>Here's a list of some platforms in this category:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.toptal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toptal</a></li> <li><a href="https://x-team.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-Team</a></li> <li><a href="https://turing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turing</a></li> <li><a href="https://triplebyte.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TripleByte</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.vettery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vettery</a></li> <li><a href="https://6nomads.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6nomads</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.crossover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crossover</a></li></ul> <p>This list is not exhaustive and there's a lot of other platforms like these. I haven't worked on any of these, so do your review before you decide to join.</p> <h3 id="remote-companies"> Remote Companies</h3> <p>Remote-first or full-remote companies fall in this category. The number of such companies is increasing rapidly, thanks to the pandemic. You can apply to these companies directly from their job posts and work as independent contractors after you successfully complete their recruitment process.</p> <p>I prefer this category of remote work because you get to work for the company directly. Generally, the teams and cultures are better in companies who hire directly.</p> <p>Similarly, the compensations and benefits are better as well. Most of them will provide PTOs and have good practices around remote work.</p> <p>Some popular companies that hire remotely are:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://doist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doist</a></li> <li><a href="https://zapier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zapier</a></li> <li><a href="https://buffer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buffer</a></li> <li><a href="https://gitlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gitlab</a></li> <li><a href="https://automattic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automattic</a></li> <li><a href="https://basecamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Basecamp</a></li></ul> <p>There are many job forums and aggregate websites that you can subscribe to for job openings in remote companies. You can create email subscriptions according to your choices. Here's a list of some popular remote job forums:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://weworkremotely.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We Work Remotely</a></li> <li><a href="https://remoteok.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RemoteOK</a></li> <li><a href="https://angel.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AngelList</a></li> <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?r=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stack OverFlow jobs</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/remote-jobs-SRCH_KO0,6.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glass Door Jobs</a></li> <li><a href="https://remotecircle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RemoteCircle</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit Remote Jobs Forum</a></li> <li><a href="https://remotive.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remotive</a></li> <li><a href="https://jobs.underpin.company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Underpin</a></li> <li><a href="https://remote.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote.co</a></li> <li><a href="http://remote4me.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote4Me</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/remote-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn jobs</a></li> <li><a href="http://remotepython.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote Python</a></li></ul> <p>These platforms are great for job search.

							<p>One of my favorite makefile debugging tricks is this rule for printing out the value of a variable:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">print-%:
        @echo '$*=$($*)'</span></pre>
<p>
Throw this into a GNU make makefile and then print any <span><span face="Courier New">make</span></span> variable you like by invoking targets like <span><span face="Courier New">print-MAKE_VERSION</span></span>:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">ericm@chester:/tmp$ gmake print-MAKE_VERSION
MAKE_VERSION=3.81</span></pre>
<p>
You can imagine how handy this is when diagnosing issues with your makefiles.  Here’s how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li><span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> defines a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Pattern-Rules"><i>pattern rule</i></a> that matches any target that starts with the characters <span><span face="Courier New">print-</span></span>.</li>
<li>In the context of a pattern rule, the <span><span face="Courier New">$*</span></span> variable expands to the <i>stem</i> of the target, that part which matched the <span><span face="Courier New">%</span></span> in the pattern.  In my example above, that corresponds to <i>MAKE_VERSION</i>.</li>
<li>GNU make variable expansion rules allow for variable references <i>inside</i> variable names, so <span><span face="Courier New">$($*)</span></span> expands first to <span><span face="Courier New">$(MAKE_VERSION)</span></span>, and finally to the value of the <span><span face="Courier New">MAKE_VERSION</span></span> variable.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Makefile injection with <span face="Courier New">-f</span></h3>
<p>
The <span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> rule is a slick hack, but it’s a nuisance to have to modify a makefile just to use it.  Worse, you might not even be able to modify the makefile.  Fortunately, there’s a solution:  the <span><span face="Courier New">-f</span></span> command-line option.  You’re probably familiar with it — that’s how you tell gmake to use a different makefile than the default <span><span face="Courier New">Makefile</span></span> when it starts.  For example, if you have a  makefile named <span><span face="Courier New">build.mak</span></span>:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">gmake -f build.mak</span></pre>
<p>
What you may not know is that you can use <i>multiple</i> <span><span face="Courier New">-f</span></span> options on the command line.  GNU make will read each file in turn, incorporating the contents of each just as if they were included with the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Include"><span><span face="Courier New">include</span></span></a> directive.  We can create a simple makefile called <span><span face="Courier New">printvar.mak</span></span> containing nothing but our <span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> rule, then inject it into any makefile we want like this:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">gmake -f printvar.mak -f Makefile print-MAKE_VERSION</span></pre>
<h3>A shell script to save typing</h3>
<p>
The combination of the <span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> rule and the <span><span face="Courier New">-f</span></span> command-line option is powerful, but it’s unwieldy — too many characters to type.  The solution is a shell script wrapper:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">#!/bin/bash

filename=""
if [ -f GNUmakefile ] ; then
  filename="GNUmakefile"
elif [ -f makefile ] ; then
  filename="makefile"
elif [ -f Makefile ] ; then
  filename="Makefile"
fi
if [ -n "$filename" ] ; then
  vars=""
  for n in $@ ; do
    vars="$vars print-$n"
  done
  gmake -f $filename -f printvar.mak $vars
else
  echo "No makefile found" 1&gt;&amp;2
  exit 1
fi</span></pre>
<p>
Save that in a file called <span><span face="Courier New">printvars</span></span> somewhere on your <span><span face="Courier New">PATH</span></span> and you can do things like this:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">ericm@chester:/tmp$ printvars MAKE_VERSION COMPILE.cc
MAKE_VERSION=3.81
COMPILE.cc=g++    -c</span></pre>
<h3>Advanced <span><span face="Courier New">make</span></span> variable diagnostics</h3>
<p>
Beyond simply printing the value of a variable, GNU make 3.81 has three built-in functions that allow introspection on variables, which you can add to the <span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> rule for additional diagnostics.</p>
<p>
First is the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Origin-Function"><span><span face="Courier New">$(origin)</span></span></a> function, which tells you how a variable was defined.  For example, if a variable <span><span face="Courier New">FOO</span></span> was inherited from the environment, <span><span face="Courier New">$(origin FOO)</span></span> will give the result <span><span face="Courier New">environment</span></span>.  Variables defined in a makefile will give the result <span><span face="Courier New">file</span></span>, and so forth.</p>
<p>
Next is the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Flavor-Function"><span><span face="Courier New">$(flavor)</span></span></a> function, which tells you the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Flavors">flavor of the variable</a>, either <span><span face="Courier New">simple</span></span> or <span><span face="Courier New">recursive</span></span>.</p>
<p>
Finally is the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Value-Function"><span><span face="Courier New">$(value)</span></span></a> function, which gives you the <i>unexpanded</i> value of the variable.  For example, if you have variables like this:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">FOO=123
BAR=$(FOO)</span></pre>
<p>
<span><span face="Courier New">$(value BAR)</span></span> will give the result <span><span face="Courier New">$(FOO)</span></span>, rather than the fully-expanded <span><span face="Courier New">123</span></span> that you might expect.</p>
<p>
With these additions, the <span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> rule now looks like this:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">print-%:
	@echo '$*=$($*)'
	@echo '  origin = $(origin $*)'
	@echo '  flavor = $(flavor $*)'
	@echo '   value = $(value  $*)'</span></pre>
<p>
And here’s how it looks in action:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">ericm@chester:/tmp$ printvars MAKE_VERSION COMPILE.cc
MAKE_VERSION=3.81
  origin = default
  flavor = simple
   value = 3.81
COMPILE.cc=g++    -c
  origin = default
  flavor = recursive
   value = $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $(TARGET_ARCH) -c</span></pre>

      <p>We’ve joined <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/making-twitter-a-better-home-for-writers.html?utm_campaign=The%20week%20in%20newsletters&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. This is big news for people who use Revue, people who will start using Revue and the whole team who built it. So in this email I wanted to go a little deeper than just this news. And that’s what email does better than any other platform. It lets you go deeper with a wide audience, both in your relationship and in your thinking. Add nuance, context, speak personally.</p><p>That experience inspired us to build the first version of Revue. We wanted to make sending an email newsletter as simple and enjoyable as Tweeting. That core goal has never changed, but the world around us sure has.</p><p>Email has become a much more important publishing platform. The publishing world is working even harder at its re-invention. And we’re proud to be part of that. Today, Revue makes it easy for a wide variety of creators and publishers to send a newsletter — and make money from it.</p><p>We help them find an audience, create a deep connection and grow without limits.</p><p>Today, we serve a spectrum of customers, from ambitious media upstarts like The Markup to independent creators like Scott Melker and even large legacy publishers like Germany’s Madsack. And while different, all of them come to Revue for one purpose: to transform how we share and absorb content.&nbsp;</p><p>They want to change the way publishing works. Who gets heard and who gets paid. And that’s what connects their goals to us, the people who build Revue.</p><p>The folks over at Twitter are amazing partners who believe in and add to our mission. Thanks to them we can invest more, build faster, and get better for you.</p><p>Thanks to our joining Twitter, we can make publishing on email even more accessible. As a first step, we’re excited to share some updates that will improve the way you can build and get paid for your content:</p><p>🤝 Starting a newsletter on Revue is now free</p><p>🤝 On paid newsletters, we only charge 5%</p><p>We’ve made these changes so that everyone can be a creator on Revue, with the opportunity to scale their newsletters and a paying audience without the added fees or obstacles that can limit growth.</p><p>One important element to our customers success is giving you full control. You own your audience, your content, your brand. You can send from your own domain. You can connect Revue to hundreds of other tools without coding. And of course we have an API for you to build on.</p><p>We are also building a version of Revue for larger creators and publications. They have even more control, This version offers features like fully custom designs and tools to help them manage their audience, cross-promote newsletters and include subscription offers.</p><p>For now, we’ll continue to operate as a standalone business. But expect to hear more about how we’re working with Twitter soon as we look at more ways to help you grow faster, be discovered more easily and build even deeper connections.</p><p>Our goal is to create the single best place in the world for media businesses of the future to start, to grow big and to innovate. There is a lot to do, so we’ll keep working on it — along with all the people who use Revue.</p><p>🧡</p><p>Martijn, Founder</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/img/posts/react-as-generator-engine.webp" alt="Post cover image"><p>React permanently changed the way how developers write web-apps. Personally, we love React and knew it would solve many pain points we faced with Nunjucks. Therefore in the last <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/shape-up-process/issues/1">cycle</a> we integrated it as a template rendering engine into our <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator">Generator</a>. This post is a short introduction for developers who write or plan to write templates for AsyncAPI specification using React. It also includes a comparison with the default Nunjucks renderer.</p><h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2><p>Your React template requires <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk">@asyncapi/generator-react-sdk</a> as a dependency. You need it to access the <strong>File</strong> component required as a root component responsible for rendering a file. Furthermore, it provides some common components to make your development easier, like <strong>Text</strong> or <strong>Indent</strong>.	</p><p>Let's consider a basic React template file as the one below called <strong>MyTemplate.js</strong>:</p><p>The exported default function returns the <strong>File</strong> component as a root component that the <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator">Generator</a> uses to figure out what file it should generate. In the example above, we overwrite the default functionality of saving the file as <strong>MyTemplate.js</strong>, and we set <strong>asyncapi.md</strong> as the filename. Using the <strong>Text</strong> component, we specify what content should be rendered inside the file. The content of the resulting file is: <code>Some text that should render as is\n</code>. Notice the <strong>\n</strong> character at the end. It is automatically added after the <strong>Text</strong> component.</p><blockquote><p>For further information about components and their props, see the <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk">Generator React SDK</a>.	 </p></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator">Generator</a> doesn't use React renderer by default. You need to specify in the template configuration that your template is based on React. For that, change the <strong>renderer</strong> field of <strong>generator</strong> object inside the template's <strong>package.json</strong> file:</p><p>You can find more information about the Generator configuration <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/blob/master/docs/authoring.md#configuration-file">here</a>.	 </p><h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2><p>The process of creating content from React components consists of two steps: transpile and render.	 </p><p>The SDK has a custom transpiler which ensures that any directory in template's <strong>template</strong> folder are transpiled using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup">Rollup</a>. Rollup helps bundling all dependencies and transpile them into CommonJS modules. This is required because this library will be used through NodeJS (by AsyncAPI Generator) which does not understand these new modules natively and we do not want to limit the developer in which syntax they prefer nor how they want to separate code.</p><p>Also, SDK has its own reconciler. It traverses through each element in the template structure and transforms it into a pure string. Prop <code>children</code> is always converted to a regular string and stored in the <code>childrenContent</code> prop in each component. Check the below example, to see how it works. In addition, you can also see how to apply the composition to templates using components:</p><p>There are some restrictions:</p><ul><li>React hooks feature is not allowed.</li><li>HTML tags are not supported.</li><li>React internal components like <code>Fragments</code>, <code>Suspense</code>, and others are skipped.</li></ul><h2 id="comparison-with-nunjucks">Comparison with Nunjucks</h2><p>The AsyncAPI generator still uses <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">Nunjucks</a> as a default render engine. It's a templating language, heavily focused on string literals, filters (similar to bash pipes), and partials called macros.	</p><p>The next sections compare how you can accomplish certain things in Nunjucks and React. For more complex examples, see the <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates">template-for-generator-templates</a> repository with examples based on React and compare those with <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates/tree/nunjucks">nunjucks</a> branch.</p><h3 id="creating-reusable-parts">Creating reusable parts</h3><p>It may sound obvious, but when writing any code, even a template, a programmer wants to create reusable parts that separate repeating logic.</p><p>In Nunjucks, you can reuse parts of the template using <strong>macros</strong>, in React, using <strong>components</strong>. Imagine that you are writing a template that produces Markdown content. You need to create a reusable macro/component that renders a list from an array of strings.</p><p>Using Nunjucks you can write the code below:</p><p>Using React you can write the code below:</p><p>Looking at both examples we see that in Nujucks we operate on string literals, it means that when passing data to a macro, you always need to know what type of data the macro takes. In React we operate on JS objects/variables. By this, your IDE should always inform you what value, of what type, you must pass to component. Additionally, you must place Nunjucks's macro inside the <strong>partials</strong> folder of the template. Using React, you can put your components wherever you want.</p><h3 id="using-third-party-packages">Using third party packages</h3><p>Using helper functions from third-party packages, in Nunjucks you must apply them as <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/blob/master/docs/authoring.md#filters">filters</a>. For example, you want to use one function from <a href="https://github.com/esamattis/underscore.string">Underscore.string</a> library like <strong>cleanDiacritics</strong>, which replaces diacritic characters with closest ASCII equivalents. To do this, you must create a function inside <strong>filters</strong> folder to convert the function to Nunjucks's filter:</p><p>And then you can use this function inside your template/macro:</p><p>The main problem with this solution is that it creates an unnecessary boilerplate - you must create a function in a separate file. Another problem is that you operate on the name of this helper function which means you must always remember what filters you have included in your template.</p><p>In opposite, in React you can use <code>Underscore.string</code> directly in your template:</p><p>It is worth mentioning that when using packages in this way, you always operate on the reference to the function, not on its name, so you know what functions you have in the file's scope.</p><h2 id="cons--pros">Cons &amp; Pros</h2><p>Like any solution, React has its advantages as well as disadvantages.</p><h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3><ul><li>Using React, you use JS directly. You don't need to learn custom Nunjuck's syntax, only how React works under the hood.</li><li>It provides better debugging functionality that is not possible with Nunjucks.</li><li>It provides better error stack traces.</li><li>Better tools support development. You write templates in JavaScript, you use a reference to functions/variables, and therefore your IDE can tell you what you can use in a given scope.	</li><li>Provides better support for separating code into more manageable chunks/components. You don't need to create <strong>partials</strong> folder. You can create React component wherever you want, also next to the template's source code.</li><li>You can easily test your components. It is difficult with Nunjucks. You can split template file into separate chunks and test them in separate test cases.</li></ul><h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3><ul><li>Common pain when writing templates with React is related to indentations and new lines. However, we have several helpers in SDK to make your life easier, like <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk/blob/master/src/components/Indent.tsx"><code>Indent</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk/blob/master/src/components/Text.tsx"><code>Text</code></a> components.</li><li>Some people don't like to mix logic inside template files, so probably React won't be friendly for them.</li><li>HTML tags at the moment are not supported. The developer must write them as a string literal, like <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates/blob/main/components/ListChannels.js#L18">here</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="resources">Resources</h2><p>We use React render engine already in three official AsyncAPI templates:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates">template-for-generator-templates</a> template showcases features of <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator">the AsyncAPI Generator</a>, including the React renderer. It shows how to write templates, reusable parts (components), what are the recommended patterns. It has simple and complex examples. You can also check how the same things could be done using Nunjucks in <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates/tree/nunjucks">this</a> branch.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/markdown-template">markdown-template</a> is written using React. It generates documentation into a Markdown file.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/ts-nats-template/">ts-nats-template</a> is re-written using React to generate a TypeScript NATS client.</li></ul><p>If you want to check the source code of React renderer, go to the <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk">official repository</a>.</p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>There is a long way ahead of us to stabilize React as a render engine. We know about problems that make it unpleasant to write templates using React, such as indents or new lines, but we will work on that. Additionally, we have a couple of improvements on our list that will allow things like <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk/issues/10">File Templates</a> to be simplified in the Generator. We also plan to support <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk/issues/3">TypeScript</a>.</p><p>We are waiting for your feedback.</p><p>Happy coding!</p><blockquote><p>Cover photo is from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080179/"><code>Drunken Master</code></a> movie.</p></blockquote></article></div>]]>

<p>In Appsmith, our developer users define business logic by writing any JS code in between <code>{{ }}</code> dynamic bindings almost anywhere in the app. They can use this while creating SQL queries, APIs, or triggering actions.
This functionality lets you control how your app behaves with the least amount of configuration. Underneath the hood, the platform will evaluate all this code in an optimized manner to make sure the app remains performant yet responsive.</p>
<p>Let us take an example of binding a query response to a table widget.</p>
<p>It all starts with the binding brackets <code>{{ }}</code> . When the platform sees these brackets and some code in it, in a widget or action configuration, it will flag the field as a dynamic field so that our evaluator can pick it up later. In our example let us bind usersQuery to usersTable</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608182443695/gunous9nM.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot_2020-12-05_at_2.46.08_PM.png"></p>
<p>Since we have added this binding in our tableData field, we will flag this field and store it in our widget config</p>
<pre><code>
{
  <span>"usersTable"</span>: {
        ...
        <span>"tableData"</span>: <span>"{{
            usersQuery.data
                .map(row =&gt; ({
                    name: row.name,
                    email: row.email
                }))
            }}"</span>,
        <span>"dynaminBindingPathList"</span>: [
            {<span>"key"</span>: <span>"tableData"</span>}
            ...
        ]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the background, our evaluation listener, always keeps a lookout for such events that would need an evaluation. For our example, this is a scenario that definitely needs an evaluation, so it kicks off our evaluator.</p>
<p>We pass on our current list of app data constructed in what we call as <code>DataTree</code> to the evaluator thread and patiently wait to hear back from it ⏱</p>
<pre><code>
{
    <span>"usersQuery"</span>: {
        <span>"config"</span>: {...},
        <span>"data"</span>: [...]
    },
    <span>"usersTable"</span>: {
        <span>"tableData"</span>: <span>"{{
            usersQuery.data
                .map(row =&gt; ({
                    name: row.name,
                    email: row.email
                }))
            }}"</span>,
        <span>"dynaminBindingPathList"</span>: [{<span>"key"</span>: <span>"tableData"</span>}]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>For performance reasons, we run our evaluation process in a separate background thread with the help of <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">web workers</a>. This ensures that evaluation cycles running longer than 16ms do not hang up the main thread giving the app bandwidth to always respond to user events.</p>
<p>Inside the thread, the event listener gets a wake-up call and gets to work. </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Get differences</strong>: First it will calculate differences in the <code>DataTree</code> from the last time. This will ensure we only process changes and not the whole tree.</p>
<p>  In our example, we would see the <code>usersTable.tableData</code> has changed and <code>usersTable.dynamicBindingPathList</code> has a new entry.</p>
<p>  It takes each difference, filters any un-important changes, and processes the rest.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Get evaluation order with dependency map</strong>: It also maintains a <code>DependencyMap</code> between various entity properties. The evaluator will notice if any bindings have changed and recreate the sort order accordingly.</p>
<p>  For our example, we will infer that <code>usersTable.tableData</code> now depends on <code>usersQuery.data</code>. This means that the query response should always be evaluated before we can evaluate the table data and that whenever we see a change in the query response, we need to re-evaluate the table data as well</p>
<pre><code>  
  {
      ...
      <span>"usersTable.tableData"</span>: [<span>"usersQuery.data"</span>]
  }

  
  [
      <span>"usersQuery.data"</span>,
      <span>"usersTable.tableData"</span>
  ]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluate:</strong> After creating an optimized evaluation order, we will evaluate the update the tree, in that said order. Evaluation happens via a closed <code>eval</code> function with the whole <code>DataTree</code> acting as its global scope. This is why we can directly reference any object in our <code>DataTree</code> in our code.</p>
<pre><code>  

  <span>const</span> code = <span>`
    usersQuery.data.map(row =&gt; ({
      name: row.name,
      email: row.email
    }))
  `</span>;

  <span>const</span> scriptToEvaluate = <span>`
    function closedFunction () {
      const result = <span>${code}</span>;
      return result
    }
    closedFunction()
  `</span>;

  <span>const</span> result = <span>eval</span>(scriptToEvaluate);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Validate and parse:</strong> We always want to make sure the values returned after evaluation to be in the right data type that the widget expects. The ensures the widget always gets predictable data even if your code has returned some errors. This is also needed for any function down the line in the evaluation order, if it refers to this field, will always get a reasonable data type to work with.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And that completes it. At the end of this, we will have a fully evaluated <code>DataTree</code> that we can then send back to the main thread and start listening for any new event to do this whole process again.</p>
<pre><code>
{
    <span>"usersQuery"</span>: {
        <span>"data"</span>: [...] 
    }
    <span>"usersTable"</span>: {
        <span>"tableData"</span>: [...]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Our main thread gets an event saying the evaluation is complete, with the new evaluated <code>DataTree</code> which it stores in the app redux state. From here, the widgets pick up their data and render it.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608182466454/vym6oXaQG.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot_2020-12-05_at_2.46.22_PM.png"></p>
<h3 id="summarizing-our-philosophy">Summarizing our philosophy</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pull vs Push:</strong> While building a low code app builder for varied developers, we thought hard about how the written code works with the rest of the platform. We wanted configuration to be easy to start yet powerful when it needed to be. For this reason, we went with a Pull based architecture rather than Push.</p>
<p>  What this means is that in most places, you won't have to think about how the data will get to a field. You write code that pulls everything from the global <code>DataTree</code> and sets it to the field where you write it. This way the moment the underlying data changes, it get propagated to all the fields dependant on it and you as a developer do not have to orchestrate ui changes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong> One-way data flow:</strong> Since we are built on top React.js and Redux, we strongly embrace the one-way data flow model.</p>
<p>  What this means is that you cannot set a table's data directly to that field from some other part of the app. If you do need to update the table, you will have to trigger the query to run, which will then cause the table to re-render with the new data. This helps the code you write easy to reason about and bugs easy to find. It also encapsulates each widget's and action's logic in itself for good separation of concern.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Before we begin, I have an announcement to make regarding the future of this podcast. Beginning February 1st, <em>The Grant Williams Podcast</em> will become part of the copper membership tier of my new website, <a href="https://grant-williams.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grant-williams.com</a>. Now, the copper tier will include every future episode of the end game, the super terrific happy hour and the narrative game, as well as access to a series of special one-on-one conversations I’ll be having with a group of truly extraordinary people throughout the rest of this year, beginning with my dear friend and mentor, Anthony Deden of Edelweiss Holdings. At the site, you’ll also find a silver tier, which in addition to access to <em>The Grant Williams Podcast</em>, will include a year subscription to my monthly newsletter, <em>Things That Make You Go Hmmm…</em> But you can find out a lot more about all that by visiting <a href="https://grant-williams.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grant-williams.com</a>. And now on with the show.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Something that’s fascinated me over the last 12 months has been how keen people are to hear my views on cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin in particular. I’ve tried to lay out my position as clearly as I can over that year. And I’ll do the same again here. I understand the bull case for crypto very, very well. In many ways, it’s a similar case to the one I’ve been making myself over the years for gold. Because of that, I’ve been predisposed to be bullish on Bitcoin, but like anything I come across that looks interesting, I maintain what I view as a healthy level of skepticism until I’ve had any fears allayed. As far as Bitcoin goes, I’m just not quite there yet. There are things which concern me about its long-term viability. And so until I can have those questions answered to my satisfaction, Bitcoin, to me, remains a highly speculative asset.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>The difficulty I’ve found in getting my questions answered stems largely from the binary opinion set that I’ve found wherever I’ve searched for those answers. Bitcoin, it seems is either going to eat the world or it’s a complete Ponzi scheme. And finding a space between those two opinions where my possible answers might lie, has proven very difficult for me. Last week, an extremely negative article about Tether, the supposedly dollar-backed stablecoin, did the rounds and from the commentary and discussion around that article, the idea of a debate rose organically on FinTwit, a debate that I was asked to moderate. Needless to say in my own search for answers to my questions, I was happy to oblige. And so here we are.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Joining me today are Mike Green of Logica Funds, a man with a towering intellect and a decidedly negative view of Bitcoin (and Tether for that matter). And Nic Carter, co-founder of Castle Island Ventures &amp; CoinMetrics and another man in position of some serious intellectual firepower, but who sees Bitcoin in a completely different and extremely positive light. But the idea here is to offer both sides of the Bitcoin debate, a chance to speak and engage respectfully with the other, in the hopes of providing anybody listening with something to either challenge their own assumptions, answer nagging questions they might have, or simply provide them with some good old fashioned confirmation bias. The goal isn’t to change anybody’s mind about Bitcoin, although who knows, maybe that can actually happen in either direction, but rather to have a thoughtful, respectful conversation about what is… No matter which side of the debate you find yourself on the hottest topic in finance right now. So let’s get to it. A conversation with Mike Green and Nic Carter.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Gentlemen, welcome both of you to this special podcast that kind of arose organically. And I’m absolutely delighted that the two you were willing to take the time to come on and talk about this because there’s been so much said and written about Bitcoin, obviously, on both sides and right at the top of the show, I’m going to position myself and explain to everybody where I am because I think that’s important for the guy in the middle to understand. I like to refer myself as a ‘bit skeptic’. I understand the potential promise of Bitcoin. I’ve heard some very smart people say very smart things about… A lot of which resonates with me from my time in the precious metals space, but I have questions that I just don’t really… There are things that just don’t quite click with me.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>There are problems that I worry about and what I’ve found when I’ve been on the fringes of this space is that, it’s difficult to get thoughtful, considered answers that… Particularly on Twitter. Thoughtful, considered answers, that don’t just degenerate very quickly into a slanging match from both sides. So to have two thoughtful guys like you, join me on the podcast is a real treat for me. So thank you both for doing that.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>What we’re going to do, I think, is start talking about Bitcoin. And then as part of the conversation that I want to discuss, however, briefly, or however long it takes, the recent Tether piece, the doomsday piece, which got everybody’s in a flat a few days ago. So I think what I might do is start with you, Nic. And just to give us really your kind of introduction to Bitcoin and your thoughts on what it is and what it potentially could be. And perhaps any of the things that trouble you about it, if there is anything, in fact.</p><p>Nic Carter:</p><p>Sure. Yeah. And thanks so much for moderating, Grant. I’m a big fan of your show. And Mike, thanks for agreeing to the debate as well. I’m really excited to talk with you. A fan of yours as well. So from my perspective, I’ve been sort of professionally involved in Bitcoin probably since about 2017. It was when I joined Fidelity as their Bitcoin analyst, right. So I was probably one of the first folks on Wall Street sort of be a dedicated Bitcoin guy. Prior to that, I was just an enthusiast, right. I was an amateur Bitcoiner. I mean, there wasn’t really a crypto industry before that, right. And now, my current affiliation is partner at a venture fund and we invest in startups building on public blockchains. So, I certainly believe in this stuff, putting my capital to work, and I believe in the vision of the future that includes cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Nic Carter:</p><p>The way I see Bitcoin is, it’s kind of two things in one. It is a protocol for sending value through communications medium and encoding value and information. And it’s also an asset. It’s a monetary asset and I would compare it to commodity. So I would say it’s a non-state monetary commodity. It’s something that stores value over time and space. And it’s an independent system of property rights where rather it proposes a state independent system of property rights. So you don’t need an established legal system or a police force or the state to enforce the rights. The rights are enforced through cryptography. And so in that respect, it’s sort of contextually important. So in some cases where you have a functioning financial system, functioning legal system, that has no risk of expropriation, you have no need for Bitcoin, right.</p><p>Nic Carter:</p><p>So in the US, that would characterize most people. They’re puzzled by it. They don’t really see the need for a Bitcoin because everything works great here for now, at least. In other countries where property rights are not really respected and you have inflation or devaluations, or just simply people’s funds, banks accounts get seized on a frequent basis, then maybe there is more of a need for a non-state system. So those are the countries where we’re seeing some adoption of Bitcoin. You also see plenty of Americans getting exposure to it, maybe an anticipation of a future time when it becomes super relevant or just out of the speculative mania too.</p><p>Nic Carter:</p><p>But quite briefly, that’s how I see it. I think it’s important for there to be non-state monetary technologies. I think Bitcoin is extremely promising and it improves upon gold in some really critical respects, particularly along the domain of auditability, verifiability and taking physical settlement, which is where I think it really improves upon gold. But I think if you are positively disposed towards gold, you should probably take a look at Bitcoin because it’s really similar in some of its critical features. Although, of course, not the same thing by any means. So that’s my sort of very short description of Bitcoin.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Yeah. It’s really interesting. And I think my time spent in the precious metal space where my… I was originally exposed to Bitcoin, I saw the similarities between the Bitcoin proposition as it was then, and the things that gold has. I definitely have a few questions about those supposed improvements upon gold, which we’ll get into later on. But I want to turn it over to Mike. Mike, just if you can, your… Because, obviously, your view on Bitcoin is the polar opposite to Nic’s. And so I’m curious to get an overview of that and the things that concern you the most. And then we can perhaps dive into some of these things.</p><p>Mike Green:</p><p>So it’s interesting because I actually don’t think that we are necessarily polar opposites. I think that we have very strongly divergent opinions in terms of the value of it. So my introduction to Bitcoin happened back in 2012, my wife likes to point out that she expressed interest in buying it at $25 and wanted to put $10,000 in. And I said, “Well, why don’t we actually put money in that matters?” And so do $100,000. And she, of course, said that’s far too much and did nothing with it, right. Now, my view on Bitcoin for a very long time was get yourself to neutral. Own enough that it’s not going to make you crazy rich and own enough that you’re not sitting there with an incredible amount of FOMO as you watch others get rich around you.</p><p>Mike Green:</p><p>I changed that view in 2020 for a very, very simple reason, which is, as I began to see the dynamic of Americans express the view that Bitcoin was the solution to an overly aggressive central …</p></div></div></div></div>

  <div>
    <p>I’ve been a contributor to GNU projects for many years, notably both GCC and GNU libc, and recently I led the effort to make the first release of Autoconf since 2012 (<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf/2020-12/msg00002.html">release announcement for Autoconf 2.70</a>). For background and context, see <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/834682/">the LWN article my colleague Sumana Harihareswara of Changeset Consulting wrote</a>.</p>
<p>Autoconf not having made a release in eight years is a symptom of a deeper problem. Many GNU projects, including all of the other components of the Autotools (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/">Automake</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/">Libtool</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/">Gnulib</a>, etc.) and the software they depend upon (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/">GNU M4</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU Make</a>, etc.) have seen a steady decline in both contributor enthusiasm and user base over the past decade. I include myself in the group of declining enthusiasts; I would not have done the work leading up to the Autoconf 2.70 release if I had not been paid to do it. (I would like to say thank you to the project funders: Bloomberg, Keith Bostic, and the GNU Toolchain Fund of the FSF.)</p>
<p>The Autotools are in particularly bad shape due to the decline in contributor enthusiasm. Preparation for the Autoconf 2.70 release took almost twice as long as anticipated; I made five beta releases between July and December 2020, and merged 157 patches, most of them bugfixes. On more than one occasion I was asked why I was going to the trouble—isn’t Autoconf (and the rest of the tools by implication) thoroughly obsolete? Why doesn’t everyone switch to something newer, like <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a> or <a href="https://mesonbuild.com/">Meson</a>? (See the comments on Sumana’s LWN article for examples.)</p>
<p>I personally don’t think that the Autotools are obsolete, or even all that much more difficult to work with than some of the alternatives, but it <em>is</em> a fair question. Should development of the Autotools continue? If they are to continue, we need to find people who have the time and the inclination (and perhaps also the funding) to maintain them steadily, rather than in six-month release sprints every eight years. We also need a proper roadmap for where further development should take these projects. As a starting point for the conversation about whether the projects should continue, and what the roadmap should be, I was inspired by Sumana’s book in progress on open source project management (<a href="https://changeset.nyc/resources/getting-unstuck-sampler-offer.html">sample chapters are available from her website</a>) to write up a <q>strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats</q> analysis of Autotools.</p>
<p>This inventory can help us figure out how to build on new opportunities, using the Autotools’ substantial strengths, and where to invest to guard against threats and shore up current weaknesses.</p>
<p>Followup discussion should go to <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/autoconf">the Autoconf mailing list</a>.</p>

<h2 id="strengths">Strengths</h2>
<p>In summary: as the category leader for decades, the Autotools benefit from their architectural approach, interoperability, edge case coverage, standards adherence, user trust, and existing install base.</p>
<ul>
<li>Autoconf’s feature-based approach to compiled-code portability scales better than lists of system quirks.</li>
<li>The Autotools carry 30+ years’ worth of embedded knowledge about portability traps for C programs and shell-based build scripting on Unix (and to a lesser extent Windows and others), including variants of Unix that no other comparable configuration tool supports.</li>
<li>Autoconf and Automake support cross-compilation better than competing build systems.</li>
<li>Autoconf and Automake support software written in multiple languages better than some competing build systems (but see below).</li>
<li>Autoconf is very extensible, and there are lots of third-party <q>macros</q> available.</li>
<li>Tarball releases produced by Autotools have fewer build dependencies than tarball releases produced by competing tools.</li>
<li>Tarball releases produced by Autotools have a predictable, standardized (literally; it’s a key aspect of the <q><a href="https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/index.html">GNU Coding Standards</a></q>) interface for setting build-time options, building them, testing them, and installing them.</li>
<li>Automake tries very hard to generate Makefiles that will work with <em>any</em> Make implementation, not just GNU make, and not even just (GNU or BSD) make.</li>
<li>The Autotools have excellent reference-level documentation (better than CMake and Meson’s).</li>
<li>As they are GNU projects, users can have confidence that Autotools are and will always remain Free Software.</li>
<li>Relatedly, users can trust that architectural decisions are not driven by the needs of particular large corporations.</li>
<li>There is a large installed base, and switching to a competing build system is a lot of work.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h2>
<p>In summary: Autoconf’s core function is to solve a problem that software developers, working primarily in C, had in the 1990s/early 2000s (during the Unix wars). System programming interfaces have become much more standardized since then, and the shell environment, much less buggy. Developers of new code, today, looking at existing configure scripts and documentation, cannot easily determine which of the portability traps Autoconf knows about are still relevant to them. Similarly, maintainers of older programs have a hard time knowing which of their existing portability checks are still necessary. And weak coordination with other Autotools compounds the issue.</p>
<h3 id="autoconf">Autoconf</h3>
<ul>
<li>Autoconf (and the rest of the Autotools) are written in a combination of four old and difficult programming languages: Bourne shell, the portable subset of Make, Perl, and M4. Competing build systems tend to use newer, more ergonomic languages, which both makes it easier for them to get things done, and makes it easier for them to attract new developers.</li>
<li>All the supported languages except C and C++ are second-class citizens.</li>
<li>The set of languages that are supported has no particular rationale. Several new and increasingly popular compiled-code languages (e.g.&nbsp;Swift and Rust) are not supported, while oddities like Erlang are.</li>
<li>Much of that 30 years’ worth of embedded knowledge about portability traps is obsolete. There’s no systematic policy for deciding when some problem is too obsolete to worry about anymore.</li>
<li>Support for <em>newer</em> platforms, C standard editions, etc. is weaker than support for older things.</li>
<li>Autoconf’s extensibility is unsystematic; many of those third-party macros reach into its guts, and do things that create awkward compatibility constraints on core development. Same for existing <code>configure.ac</code>s.</li>
<li>The code quality of third-party macros varies widely; bad third-party macros reflect poorly on Autoconf proper.</li>
<li>Some of the ancillary tools distributed with Autoconf don’t work well; most importantly, autoupdate (which is <em>supposed</em> to patch a <code>configure.ac</code> to bring it in line with current Autoconf’s recommendations) is so limited and unreliable that it might be better not to have it at all.</li>
<li>Feature gaps in GNU M4 hold back development of Autoconf.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-autotools-as-a-whole">The Autotools as a whole</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are few active developers and no continuing funders.</li>
<li>GNU project status discourages new contributors because of the paperwork requirements and the perceived lack of executive-level leadership.</li>
<li>There is no continuous integration and no culture of code review. Test suites exist but are not comprehensive enough (and at the same time they’re very slow).</li>
<li>Bugs, feature requests, and submitted patches are not tracked systematically. (This is partially dependent on <a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/sysadmin/the-fsf-tech-team-doing-more-for-free-software">FSF/GNU infrastructure improvements</a> which are indefinitely delayed.)</li>
<li>There’s a history of releases breaking compatibility, and thus people are hesitant to upgrade. At the same time, Linux distributions actively want to force-upgrade everything they ship to ensure architecture support, leading to upstream/downstream friction.</li>
<li>Guide-level documentation is superficial and outdated.</li>
<li>Building an Autotools-based project directly from its VCS checkout is often significantly harder than building it from a tarball release, and may involve tracking down and installing any number of unusual tools.</li>
<li>The Autotools depend on other GNU software that is not actively maintained, most importantly GNU M4, and to a lesser extent GNU Make.</li>
<li>Coordination among the Autotools is weak, even though the tools are tightly coupled to each other. There are portions of codebases that exist solely for interoperability with other tools in the toolchain, which leads to overlapping maintainer and reviewer responsibility, slow code review and inconvenient copyright assignment processes multiplying, and causing confusion and dropped balls. For instance, there is code shared among Autoconf, Automake, and/or Gnulib by copying files between source repositories; changes to these files are extra inconvenient. The lack of coordination also makes it harder for tool maintainers to deprecate old functionality, or to decouple interfaces to make things more extensible; maintainers do not negotiate policies with each other to help. For instance, Autoconf has trouble knowing when it is safe to remove internal kludges that old versions of Automake depend on, and certain shell commands (e.g.&nbsp;aclocal) are distributed with one package but abstractly belong to another.</li>
<li>Division of labor among the Autotools, and the sources of third-party macros, is ad-hoc and unclear. (Which macros should be part of Autoconf proper? Which should be part of Gnulib? Which should be part of the Autoconf Macro Archive? Which should be shipped with Automake? Which tools should autoreconf know how to run? Etc.)</li>
<li>Automake and Libtool are not nearly as extensible as Autoconf is.</li>
<li>Unlike several competitors, Automake <em>only</em> works with Make, not with newer build drivers (e.g.&nbsp;Ninja).</li>
<li>Because Automake tries to generate Makefiles that will work with <em>any</em> Make implementation, the Makefiles it generates are much more complicated and slow than they would be if they took advantage of GNU and/or BSD extensions.</li>
<li>Libtool is notoriously slow, brittle, and difficult to modify (even worse than Autoconf proper). This is partially due to technical debt and partially due to maintaining support for completely obsolete platforms (e.g.&nbsp;old versions of AIX).</li>
<li>Libtool has opinions about the proper way to manage shared libraries that Linux distributions actively disagree with, forcing them to kludge around its code during package builds.</li>
<li>Alternatives…</li></ul></div></article></div></div>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Artificial Bodies and the Promise of Abstraction:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>A conversation with Peter Wolfendale</span></span></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></section><p><span><span><span><span><span>© Scott Eaton</span></span></span></span></span></p><div id="comp-kiemep60" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span>Please can you start by saying a few things about the rise of embodiment within contemporary philosophy? It seems to me to be mainly used as a corrective against: 1) the Cartesian notion of an immaterial mind, and 2) the materialist tendency to place the mind in the brain. But what are the main positive claims that defenders of embodiment are making?&nbsp;</span></p>



<p>I think that the meaning of the term “embodiment” in philosophical circles is deceptively diverse, and that those who champion the concept are motivated by concerns that overlap less than is often appreciated. If they are unified by one thing, it is a rogues’ gallery of common enemies. Although Descartes is the most reviled of these, his errors are often traced back to some original sin perpetrated by Plato. However, in order to make sense of these conceptual crimes, it’s worth first distinguishing the <span>explanatory</span> concerns of cognitive science and artificial intelligence from the <span>normative </span>concerns of political and social theory, while acknowledging that both of these are downstream from more general <span>metaphysical</span> concerns regarding the difference and/or relation between matter and mind. So, though there are many purely metaphysical objections to the Platonic dualism of intelligible and sensible worlds, and the Cartesian dualism of mental and physical substances, what really unites the embodiment paradigm is their objection to the outsized role that Plato, Descartes, and their inheritors give to “the life of the mind” in explaining how we make our way in the world, and establishing which aspects of it we should value. For want of a better word, we might call this “intellectualism”.</p>



<p>This “life of the mind” is distinguished by the capacity for <span>abstract thought</span>. This is to say that it abstracts away from concrete features of the context in which thinking occurs: it is <span>theoretical</span>, or unconstrained by the practical problems posed by our bodily environment; and it is <span>contemplative</span>, or independent of the sensorimotor capacities through which we interact with this environment. Both Plato and Descartes take mathematics to exemplify this sort of thinking, and on that basis, thought <span>as such</span>. Mathematical theorems are not strictly about anything in our physical environment, and they can be verified even if they’re not applicable to it, in ways that needn’t involve interacting with it. This being said, what really distinguishes Descartes from Plato is his conviction that the physical world can be accurately <span>represented</span> by mathematical models, and thus that our experiences can be treated as internal representations akin to such models. There are other problematic aspects of the Cartesian picture, but this will do for now.</p></div><section id="comp-kiemep621"><div data-testid="columns"><div id="comp-kiemep64"><div data-mesh-id="comp-kiemep64inlineContent" data-testid="inline-content"><div data-mesh-id="comp-kiemep64inlineContent-gridContainer" data-testid="mesh-container-content"><p id="comp-kiemep661" data-testid="richTextElement"><h2><span>WHAT REALLY DISTINGUISHES DESCARTES FROM PLATO IS HIS CONVICTION THAT THE PHYSICAL WORLD CAN BE ACCURATELY REPRESENTED BY MATHEMATICAL MODELS</span></h2></p></div></div></div></div></section><div id="comp-kiemep68" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span>So, what are the main explanatory objections to intellectualism?</span></p>



<p>There are two. On the one hand, its opponents claim that intellectualism ignores the vast majority of human cognition: most of our lives are spent carrying out tasks and navigating obstacles whose contours are determined by the way our body fits into its environment, rather than reasoning our way from premises to conclusions. Making a cup of tea in an unfamiliar kitchen is a more representative instance of our problem-solving capacity than demonstrating the infinity of primes. On the other, they claim that intellectualism has its priorities backwards: rather than treating this sort of “skilled coping” as a deficient form of abstract cognition, we can only understand the latter by showing how it emerges from the former. Even our ability to imagine complex geometric constructions has at some point been bootstrapped from a basic bodily grasp of orientation and gesture.</p>



<p>The most important targets of these complaints are the classical computational theory of mind in cognitive science and what gets called “good old-fashioned AI” (GOFAI). These see cognition as principally a matter of rule-governed symbol manipulation not unlike mathematical reasoning. They are opposed by a range of “4E perspectives”, so called because they emphasise some combination of the <span>embodied</span>, <span>embedded</span>, enactive, and <span>extended</span> dimensions of cognition. The extent to which these diverge from traditional views varies, but, in rough order, the points of contention are: 1) the extent to which cognition is dependent on features of the body outside of the brain (e.g., the structure of sensory organs), and features of the environment outside of the body (e.g., the availability of cognitive resources), 2) whether the concepts of computation and representation are irredeemably intellectualist (e.g., if they can account for pre-linguistic “meaning”), and 3) whether dependence implies constitution (e.g., if my notebook is part of my mind).</p>



<p><span>What about the normative objections?</span></p>



<p>Again, there are two. On the one hand, opponents claim that intellectualism reflects and reinforces implicit social hierarchies: those who have historically enjoyed the luxury of theoretical contemplation have done so because the practical problems and bodily processes it abstracts away from have been taken care of for them, often by groups who have been systematically <span>identified</span> with their bodies and bodily capacities, such as women, slaves, and colonised peoples. The disembodied Cartesian ego is an illusion engendered by ignorance and privilege. On the other, they claim that intellectualism devalues significant sources of human knowledge: there are forms of “lived experience” and “situated knowledge” that are valuable even if they aren’t (and possibly can’t be) articulated in a manner that divorces them from the embodied contexts in which they occur (e.g., their emotional valence). This Cartesian false-consciousness doesn’t simply impact the way we treat others, but even the way we treat ourselves, potentially disconnecting us from our embodied existence.</p>



<p>The idea that privileging the mind over the body is associated with other sorts of illicit privilege (e.g., economic, racial, sexual, etc.) is now fairly widespread in contemporary feminist and critical theory. However, there are a variety of philosophical frameworks drawn from the Continental tradition that get used to articulate, elaborate, and offer solutions to this problem. Roughly speaking, the main strands are Spinozist (Deleuze, Affect Theory, etc.), Nietzschean (Foucault, Butler, etc.), and phenomenological (Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, etc.), though there is much cross-pollination. The first is characterised by the metaphysical tenor of its critique, proposing some form of materialist monism as an alternative to the dualisms of Plato and Descartes. The second is characterised by its focus upon social dynamics, providing an analysis of the way bodies are “ensouled” by the internalisation of patterns of thought and action. But the last provides the greatest point of overlap with the explanatory concerns discussed above, as it provides a detailed introspective analysis of the body’s involvement in the constitution of experience. Phenomenology has had a marked influence on 4E approaches to cognition, and is responsible for the concept that straddles and sometimes connects all these varying concerns, namely, “the lived body”.</p></div><div id="comp-kiemep6b" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span>The idea of the lived body suggests that the body is not just a causal bridge between ourselves and the world, but rather that the body is our engagement with the world in a way that serves as a condition for the emergence of our subjectivity. This suggests that only a “proper” body will be fit for this purpose – no ersatz or artificial alternative will do. Embodiment is in fact “real meat” embodiment. Is this a fair picture, both in phenomenology and in the other frameworks you discuss above?</span></p>



<p>Though not every proponent of embodiment will go so far as to insist on an essential link between mind and meat, I think it’s fair to say that this is where the rhetoric of embodiment leads. To some extent, this is because it aligns with other philosophical and political goals, such as undermining pernicious distinctions between human and animal or diagnosing dangerous fantasies implicit in the very suggestion that minds could be uploaded into computer simulations. However, there are some arguments for the claim, and I’ll try to tease out the general pattern of these as I see it. But first, it’s worth saying something more about the idea of the lived body.</p>



<p>The cornerstone of the phenomenological tradition is the idea that the<span> content</span> of explicitly articulated representations, such as declarative sentences or mathematical models, depends upon a more primitive form of <span>meaning</span> implicit in ordinary conscious experience. This gets formulated in slightly different ways by Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty, but they essentially agree that our many and varied representations are able to pick out the same <span>object</span> (e.g., galaxies, spleens, recessions) across changes in time, shifts in perspective, differences of opinion, and diverging interests, only because the referential frameworks they deploy (e.g., star charts, anatomy, econometrics), are so many layers arranged on top of those simple <span>unities</span> that tie together our everyday activities (e.g., places, obstacles, tools). My coffee cup is unified as something I can reach out and grasp, but this grasping is not a carefully planned sequence of muscle movements guided by a mechanical understanding of shapes and forces, it is a single fluid movement in which my fingers fit themselves to the cup’s contours without so much as a second thought. What distinguishes the “lived body” from the “biological body” is not simply that it is not yet an object of scientific representation, but rather that it is what ties everything together in the last instance. It is the <span>origin</span> of all intentional …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

This resulted in a decoupling of the two busbars in the Ernestinovo substation, which in turn separated North-West and south-east electric power flows in this substation. As shown in Figure 1 below, North-West bound lines which remained connected to one busbar, connect Ernestinovo to Zerjavinec (Croatia) and Pecs (Hungary), while South-East bound lines which remained connected to another busbar, connect Ernestinovo to Ugljevik (Bosnia-Herzegovina) and Sremska Mitrovica (Serbia).</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ca35232da145a366158c9b4df33d787e40d621c9/129ad/assets/graphics/uploads/system-separation-figure-2.jpg" alt="" title="Figure 1 - Decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo"></p><p><em>Figure 1 - Decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo</em></p><p>The separation of flows in the Ernestinovo substation, lead to the shifting of electric power flows to neighbouring lines which were subsequently overloaded.

At the same time, the frequency in the South-East Area initially increased up to 50.6 Hz before settling at a steady state frequency between 50.2 Hz and 50.3 Hz as illustrated in Figure 4 below:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/af53041f1f9915046a980de1662f685154376b5c/670b8/assets/graphics/uploads/forth.png" alt="" title="Figure 4 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 right after the disturbance and during resynchronisation"></p><p><em>Figure 4 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 right after the disturbance and during resynchronisation</em></p><p>Due to the low frequency in the North-West Area, contracted interruptible services in France and Italy (in total around 1.7 GW) were disconnected in order to reduce the frequency deviation. These services are provided by large customers who are contracted by the respective Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to be disconnected if frequency drops under a certain threshold. In addition, 420 MW and 60 MW of supportive power were automatically activated from the Nordic and Great Britain synchronous areas respectively. These countermeasures ensured that already at 14:09 CET the frequency deviation from the nominal value of 50 Hz was reduced to around 0.1 Hz in the North-West area (Figure 4).</p><p>In order to reduce the high frequency in the South-East Area, automatic and manual countermeasures were activated, including the reduction of generation output (Eg. automatic disconnection of a 975 MW generator in Turkey at 14:04:57). As a consequence, the frequency in the South-East Area returned to 50.2 Hz at 14:29 CET and remained within control limits (49.8 and 50.2 Hz) until the resynchronisation of the two separated areas took place at 15:07:31.6 CET.</p><p>Between 14:30 CET and 15:06 CET the frequency in the South-East area was fluctuating between 49.9 Hz and 50.2 Hz due to the rather small size of the South-East Area where also several production units were disconnected (Figure 5). During this period, the frequency in the North-West Area fluctuated far less and remained close to the nominal value, due to the rather large size of the North-West Area. This frequency behaviour is a subject of further detailed investigation.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/83de537eb517d8e18789e4116bb3561294bf39c8/a45a4/assets/graphics/uploads/graph_nw_se_03_1400h-1515h.jpg" alt="" title="Figure 5 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 for the complete duration "></p><p><em>Figure 5 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 for the complete duration</em></p><p>The automatic response and the coordinated actions taken by the TSOs in Continental Europe ensured that the situation was quickly restored close to normal operation. The contracted interruptible services in Italy and in France were reconnected at 14:47 CET and 14:48 CET respectively prior to the resynchronisation of the North-West and South-East areas at 15:08 CET.</p><p>ENTSO-E continues to keep the European Commission and the Electricity Coordination Group, composed of representatives of Member States, informed and updated with detailed results of the preliminary technical analyses.</p><p>Based on the preliminary technical analyses presented above, a formal investigation following the legal framework under the Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 of 2 August 2017 (System Operation Guideline) will be established, whereby National Regulatory Authorities and ACER are invited to join with TSOs in an Expert Investigation Panel.</p><p>In line with the provisions of the mentioned Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 of 2 August 2017, ENTSO-E will present the results of the investigation to the Electricity Coordination Group and will subsequently publish a report once the analysis is completed.</p><hr><p><strong>Note:</strong> All figures and details about the sequence of the events are still subject to final investigation and possible changes.</p><p><strong>Questions and answers</strong></p><p>What is a system separation?</p><p>The transmission grids of the countries of Continental Europe are electrically tied together to operate synchronously at the frequency of approximately 50 Hz. An event on 8 January 2021 caused the Continental Europe synchronous area to separate into two areas, with an area in the South-East of Europe being temporarily operating in separation from the rest of Continental Europe.</p><p>Is this the first time such an event happens in Continental Europe?</p><p>The Continental Europe synchronous area is one of the largest interconnected synchronous electricity systems in the world in terms of its size and number of supplied customers. Such a kind of event can happen in any electric power system. System resilience and preparedness of system operators in charge have a decisive impact on the consequences of such events. A separation of the synchronous area with a much larger disturbance and impacts on customers took place in Continental Europe on the 4 November 2006. This event was extensively analysed and led to a number of substantial developments, like the European Awareness System (EAS) which is a platform allowing TSOs to exchange operational information in real time, enabling them to react immediately in case of unusual system condition. The TSOs are therefore well prepared in order to coordinate and manage such events and limit the consequences. This preparedness and a permanent observation of the system frequency allowed to resynchronize the two separated areas in a very short period of time.</p><p>How are countermeasures coordinated in Continental Europe in case of frequency deviations?</p><p>In Continental Europe, procedures are in place to avoid system disturbances and especially large frequency deviations with the risk of uncoordinated disconnection of customers or generation. The TSOs Amprion (Germany) and Swissgrid (Switzerland) are responsible for these procedures in their role as synchronous area monitor (SAM) in Continental Europe. The SAM continuously monitors the system frequency. In case of large frequency deviations, they inform all TSOs via the European Awareness System (EAS) and launch an extraordinary procedure for frequency deviations to coordinate countermeasures in a fast and effective manner in order to stabilize the system. One step of this procedure is a telephone conference by Amprion, Swissgrid, RTE (France), Terna (Italy) and REE (Spain). This teleconference took place at 14:09 CET on 8 January 2021. In the telephone conference, the situation was evaluated, the TSOs informed about countermeasures which were already activated. The TSOs of the North-West and South-East Area also coordinated the actions for reconnection in order to reach one synchronous area in Continental Europe again.</p><p>Were end customers disconnected? Were there any other consequences?</p><p>Customers in the order of 70 MW in the North-East Area and in the order of 163 MW in the South-East Area were disconnected. Due to the high resilience of the interconnected network and the rapid response of European TSOs, the security of operation and electricity supply was not endangered further. An important contribution to stabilizing the system was delivered by the previously contracted interruptible services, which were activated in France and Italy. Such contracts which have been agreed with customers allow the TSO to temporarily and automatically reduce the electrical consumption depending on the situation with the electric power system in real-time.</p><p>What is an electrical busbar?</p><p>A busbar is an electrical junction in a substation, which connects overhead lines, cables and transformers through electrical switches. Usually, there are several busbars in a substation, which can be connected by a busbar coupler. Are there special devices protecting the equipment in a substation? Various devices protect the equipment in a substation. One of them is an overcurrent protection relay, disconnecting automatically the equipment (Eg. overhead line or cable) if the electrical …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>Most of the 300,000 + plant species have leaves, and the function of all of them is to perform photosynthesis.&nbsp; They are the ultimate source for all of the oxygen and food for the rest of the food chain and help regulate the global carbon and water cycles.&nbsp; They are also nutrition superstars.&nbsp; To figure out why greens are good for you and whether all leaves are equal in this regard, we need to take quick look at global leaf structural variability and broad evolutionary patterns in the species that make their way onto our tables.<span id="more-937"></span></p>

<p>Across the global flora leaves are extraordinarily structurally variable.&nbsp; They vary in size from a tiny duckweed leaf to a huge palm frond, and in thickness from a thin lettuce leaf to a thick leaf of a succulent aloe or pine needle.&nbsp; We don’t fully understand yet why leaves are so structurally variable across species. My colleagues and I <a title="Osnas et al. Science 2013" href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2013/03/27/science.1231574" target="_blank">recently published a paper</a> demonstrating that across the global flora leaf nutrient concentrations and physiological rates of maximum photosynthetic carbon gain and respiratory carbon loss change in proportion to leaf area more strongly than they change in proportion to leaf mass.&nbsp; We demonstrate the consequences of this area-proportionality of leaf traits for how we measure, analyze and use these leaf traits in models of the global carbon cycle.</p>

<p>Of relevance here, however, is that the high area-proportionality of leaf traits simply means that the parts of the leaf that are most beneficial for humans (digestible protein, vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, digestible fiber) are likely proportional in many species to the leaf’s photosynthetic apparatus, which is clustered in a relatively thin band of cells beneath the epidermis (see image). &nbsp;Adding thickness to a leaf doesn’t necessarily add nutritious tissue and might instead add mostly fibrous, indigestible structural material (see agave photo below). &nbsp;This does not mean that the thinner the leaf, the more nutritious it is; this is just a general tendency across all plants. &nbsp;Scaled up to the level of the whole plant, though, we see that leaves have the highest ratio of nutritious material (digestible protein, vitamins and minerals, fiber) to indigestible material (for most species). &nbsp;Some fruits probably come close, but fruit is rare, and leaves are abundant.</p>

<p>One of the key variables modulating area- vs mass-proportionality of leaf traits is leaf mass per unit leaf area (LMA), which increases with leaf thickness and density. &nbsp;Lettuce leaves have very low LMA, pine needles and holly leaves have high LMA.&nbsp; Although there is very little data on the subject, the leaves that we eat tend to fall on the low end of the global LMA spectrum, shown here for a global dataset of more than 2500 wild species.</p>

<p>Leaf tenderness—reducing LMA–is certainly a trait that has undergone selection in cultivated varieties.&nbsp; In species with varietals that have undergone selection on different structures, the varieties in which selection has been directed at the leaves invariably have more tender, less bitter, and larger leaves than do varieties in which selection has been directed at different structures, such as the roots.&nbsp; For example, chard has larger and more tender greens than do beets (both <i>Beta vulgaris</i>, Caryophyllales); celery grown for stalks and leaves is more tender than the aboveground portion of the celery varietal grown for its root (both <i>Apium graveolens</i>, Apiales); and Siberian kale varieties have more tender leaves than do rutabaga varieties (both <i>Brassica napus</i>, Brassicales).</p>

<p>Kale and collards, grown for their leaves, have leaves that are more tender than those of conspecific <i>Brassica oleracea</i> grown primarily for other structures:&nbsp; kohlrabi, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts (and for those of you keeping track at home, in the <a title="The extraordinary diversity of Brassica&nbsp;oleracea" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/05/the-extraordinary-diversity-of-brassica-oleracea/" target="_blank"><i>B. oleracea</i></a>, <a title="Thanksgiving turnips and the diversity of the genus&nbsp;Brassica" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/598/" target="_blank"><i>Brassica</i></a>, and<a title="The most political vegetables: A whirlwind tour of the edible&nbsp;crucifers" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/the-most-political-vegetables-a-whirlwind-tour-of-the-edible-crucifers/" target="_blank"> Brassicaceae posts</a>,<i> </i>I erroneously lumped all kales into <i>Brassica oleracea</i>—<a title="Brassica napus kales" href="http://seedambassadors.org/Mainpages/still/napuskale/napuskale.htm" target="_blank">some of them are <i>B. napus</i></a>, including my favorite variety: Red Russian kale).&nbsp; Don’t dare throw out your beet, celeriac, rutabaga or <i>B. oleracea </i>greens, though, if you’re lucky enough to get them—they need a bit more cooking or tenderizing, but they’re still delicious and nutritious.&nbsp; At least put your celery root greens in stock.&nbsp; LMA also varies within a varietal based on growing conditions.&nbsp; Leaves grown in sun have higher LMA than leaves grown in shade.&nbsp; The impact of growing conditions within species, however, will have to wait for another time.</p>
<p>LMA is hardly the only determinant of which species make it onto our plates.&nbsp; Otherwise, we’d have our pick of hundreds of species on the low-LMA end of the global curve.&nbsp; Instead, we can put most of our greens species on a fairly legible phylogenetic tree in need of only a few disclaimer paragraphs of omissions.</p>

<p>Like many phylogenetic trees of more than a handful of species, this tree of our “greens species” commits sins of both commission and omission in the interest of producing a readable image. Omission because the species on the tree do not comprise an exhaustive list of species whose leaves people around the globe regularly consume. Commission because I included a few unusual items, such as sweet potato leaves (<i>Ipomoea</i>, Solanales), and pea shoots (Fabales), and a few taxa are single representatives of a large group.&nbsp; Sister to sweet potato on the tree, for example, is the entire family Lamiaceae, the mints.</p>

<p>We mostly use leaves from the mints as herbs and spices:&nbsp; peppermint and spearmint (<i>Mentha </i>sp.), basil (<i>Ocimum</i> sp.), thyme (<i>Thymus</i> sp.), oregano and marjoram (<i>Origanum</i> sp.), rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus</i> sp.), lemon balm (<i>Melissa</i> sp.), lavender (<i>Lavandula</i> sp.), shiso (<i>Perilla frutescens</i>), bee balm (<i>Monarda</i> sp.), and mountain mint (<i>Pycnanthemum</i> sp.).&nbsp; Also, scallions are the only representatives on the tree from the genus <i>Allium</i> in the monocot order Asparagles, which includes many edible species, the leaves of some of which are regularly employed:&nbsp; garlic, <a title="A look at&nbsp;leeks" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2013/03/03/a-look-at-leeks/" target="_blank">leeks</a>, ramps, and onions.</p>
<p>I included some of the more exotic greens in the greens tree both to avoid rousing the ire of their champions and because I was a bit shocked that some large, charismatic orders that feature prominently in the diet at large are reduced to single entries on the greens tree or are gone altogether, meaning we primarily use roots, stems, fruits or seeds from these clades, not leaves.&nbsp; Granted, this “greens tree” is mostly a tree of “greens obtained from Whole Foods and summer farmer’s markets in the continental United States.”</p>

<p>I’ve included a few weedy, wild things that I pick regularly and that one can actually occasionally pay money for at the farmer’s market:&nbsp; nettle (<i>Urtica dioica</i>, Rosales), chickweed (<i>Stellaria media</i>, Caryophyllales), miner’s lettuce (<i>Claytonia perfoliata</i>, Caryophyllales), purslane (<i>Portulaca oleracea</i>, Caryophyllales), and dandelion (<i>Taraxacum officinale</i>, Asterales).&nbsp; Largely, however, I’ve omitted species whose leaves are technically edible, at least in small doses at some point in their life cycle, but that are reduced to curiosities at the modern American table, not staples.&nbsp; Therefore, please hold your fire if you’re shaking your fist at the tree because it omits the young beech (<i>Fagus grandifolia</i>, Fagales), sassafras (<i>Sassafras albidum</i>, Laureles), or violet (<i>Viola odorata</i>, Malpighiales) leaves you like to nibble on when you hike east of the Mississippi. Fern fiddlehead (assorted Polypodiales) enthusiasts, too, forgive me. &nbsp;We use some leaves to prepare other food: &nbsp;banana leaves and corn husks to wrap&nbsp;<em>tamales</em>, and palm fronds and fig leaves to wrap fish for baking or grilling. &nbsp;I salute these leaves, but they’re not on the tree. &nbsp;Some are gone simply because I didn’t have room, such as many of the <a title="The most political vegetables: A whirlwind tour of the edible&nbsp;crucifers" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/the-most-political-vegetables-a-whirlwind-tour-of-the-edible-crucifers/">crucifer greens</a>, and asterids chrysanthemum, borage and comfrey (although those last two haven’t been placed to order yet and would therefore have been difficult to place within the asterids anyway).</p>

                    <p>An alarm clock for the rest of us</p><p>It’s a brand new year, which means I should really start writing a new post.
I’ve been wanting to for a while, but we’ve been in lockdown for two months now and Google Analytics is the only indication that I’m not alone on the planet, and most of that is bots anyway.
I’ve decided to take a page out of the book of my friend, <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/">James Stanley</a>, who both does cool things <em>and</em> actually writes about them, so I’m starting to document all my projects again.</p>
<p>Given my non-frenetic, slow-paced lifestyle, I’ve long had a non-burning need.
I don’t use an alarm to wake up, as I start work late, but I still want to know what time it is when I wake up, just to see if it’s way too early and I can go to sleep again.
A few days a week I have tennis and need to get up early, but if it’s windy or rainy or very cold, the practice gets canceled and I want to know before I’m awake enough to not be able to go to sleep again.</p>
<p>To accommodate this lifestyle, I’ve traditionally turned to my mobile phone, but that has some disadvantages.
Namely, the screen is too bright and wakes me up when I check the time, and I’m too obsessive to not check all my messages instead of falling asleep when I see the notifications on the screen.
I’ve long thought that a bedside alarm clock would be perfect for me, but I couldn’t find one that fulfilled all my requirements:</p>
<!-- break -->

<ul>
<li>I needed something that had a screen that would always be always lit, so I could check the time with one eye and half a brain awake, in the complete darkness of the bedroom.</li>
<li>A screen that wasn’t too bright and wouldn’t disturb sleep, but that would also be legible in direct sunlight, so I could see the time during the day.
This meant adaptive brightness.</li>
<li>Octagonal shape so I can lay it down on its side (or at 45°) instead of having to crane my neck up to check the time when lying down (I really did think of everything).</li>
<li>Weather forecast for the next hour or two, so I can reliably fail to wake up for tennis when not necessary.</li>
<li>Annoying beeper for alarms.</li>
<li>Less annoying built-in LEDs that would increase in brighness for a few minutes before an alarm went off, so I can wake up less annoyed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the result:</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot2.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot2-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>Look at this sexy thing.</span></p></div><p>Sexy.</p>
<h2>Designing this thing</h2>
<p>Conceptually, making an alarm clock to fulfill these requirements isn’t hard.
You take a small OLED screen, an ESP8266, connect them together, add some LEDs and a buzzer, and you’re done!
Since the hardware was more-or-less straightforward, I started with designing the octagonal case:</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/clock-back.png" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/clock-back-small.png"></a></p><p><span>The back of the clock.</span></p></div><p>The OLED screen has four mounting holes, so I designed the mount around them.
For the ESP8266, I use a WeMos D1 Mini board, as it’s quite small and nice to work with.
I initially thought I’d have to connect the WeMos to the four pins of the screen with wires, but I discovered that if you kinda squint, you can get four of the ESP8266’s pins to match up with the screen’s pins and in the correct order, which means I could solder the ESP8266 behind the screen module directly, which simplified the wiring by a lot.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/mockup.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/mockup-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>Look at that subtle off-white coloring.</span></p></div><p>While designing the clock, I created a quick mockup of the screen as I wanted it to show.
I decided I wanted the hour to be displayed in as big letters as possible, since this screen is small, and the other elements I wanted were wind speed, temperature and weather forecast for the next hour.</p>
<p>The other components left to add were a photoresistor (for sensing ambient light), a buzzer and a LED strip.
They were all straightforward to add, the resistor is connected to the ESP8266’s analog pin, and the buzzer and LED strip to some other free pins.</p>
<h2>The software</h2>
<p>The software was the slightly trickier part in this build, although that was pretty straightforward too.
I needed multiple components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting the time somehow (there’s no real-time clock on the ESP8266 and I didn’t want to add one).</li>
<li>Dimming the screen in a pleasing manner.</li>
<li>Getting the weather forecast and current weather.</li>
<li>Connecting to WiFi and autoupdating.</li>
<li>Annoying me into wakefulness in a satisfactory manner.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The clock</h3>
<p>There’s an old Chinese saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>To know the time, you must first connect to the internet.</p>

<p>Luckily, connecting to the Internet is very easy with tzapu’s <a href="https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager">excellent WiFiManager</a> library.
The clock creates an access point, you join it with your phone or computer, give it your WiFi network’s password, and you’re done.</p>
<p>After connecting, an NTP library can fetch the time every so often from the closest server, so the clock is always up to date.
It was important to me that this clock is solid enough to trust with my most important wake-up alarms, and it achieves this goal admirably (unless the internet connection is down).</p>
<p>That also takes care of autoupdates, since I have a simple, secure autoupdate machine I set up using <a href="https://gitlab.com/stavros/espota-server">ESPOTA-server, an autoupdate server I wrote for the ESP8266</a>.
The clock checks for a new update every day, and automatically downloads and installs it.
This way, distributing updates will work reliably, even to millions of devices, for when you realize that collecting all the users’ personal data is slightly monetizable.</p>
<h3>The dimming</h3>
<p>After a bit (or a lot) of searching, I finally found how to dim the OLED screen, and another important feature was well on the way of being implemented.
Because it was rather hard to find, I’ll post the code here, along with the appropriate SEO keyword for people to be able to find it.
Here is the code for dimming an SSD1306-compatible, I2C 128x64 OLED screen:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>void</span> <span>brightnessTask</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>brightness</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Set the brightness of the SSD1306 OLED screen with this hack.</span>
    <span>// From https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFpXfSnDNSY.</span>
    <span>// `brightness` should be a value between 5 (for some reason) and 255.</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>SSD1306_SETCONTRAST</span><span>);</span> <span>//0x81</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>brightness</span><span>);</span>

    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>SSD1306_SETPRECHARGE</span><span>);</span> <span>//0xD9</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>

    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>SSD1306_SETVCOMDETECT</span><span>);</span> <span>//0xDB</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Once I discovered that, the rest of the dimming was easy:
I would just read the ambient light from the photoresistor and set the screen’s brightness according to the photoresistor’s value.</p>
<p>Another job <del>well</del> done.</p>
<h3>The weather</h3>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot1.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot1-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>What a beauty.</span></p></div><p>Getting the weather was easier than I thought.
<a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeather</a> has a simple API, which accepts a pair of coordinates and gives you the current weather and forecast for that location.
It only took a few minutes to fetch that data on the clock, and then I spent some time positioning them on the screen and turning the forecast into an appropriate icon so it could be displayed on the small screen.</p>
<p>To display the icons, I used <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/overview">Adafruit’s always helpful GFX library</a> and converted the OpenWeather icons to a format more suitable for display on a monochrome screen.
This took a bit of trial and error, as I wanted the icons to be easily distinguishable at a glance, even though their size was 12x12 pixels and just one color.
In the end, I think they worked out well, as it’s easy to tell if it’s raining or not.</p>
<h3>The wakefulness</h3>
<p>So the initial plan here was to have a buzzer buzz loudly and annoyingly in an attempt to wake me up.
However, I am a pretty light sleeper, and I hate loud and annoying sounds (surprisingly), so I wanted this to be a last resort.
The solution I came up with here is the following:</p>
<p>Say I want to set the alarm for 9:30, just in time to be ten minutes late for tennis.
The LEDs would start glowing very faintly at 9:20, slowly increasing in intensity over the next ten minutes, at which point they’d reach maximum.
If I still wasn’t up by then, the buzzer would begin beeping at the top of its lung, hopefully waking me up reliably.
This seemed like a pretty good algorithm, and one that would both wake me up pleasantly and reliably.</p>
<p>There was only one problem:
The clock doesn’t have any buttons or controls or any way for me to enter the alarm time.
I could create a web server where I could configure alarms, but I figured I’d rather get a rooster instead, so I did neither and just made an alarm clock that cannot alarm.
This symbolizes the futility of human existence and its incessant search for meaning in a cold and unfeeling universe that’s ultimately profoundly devoid of such, and then you die.</p>
<p>Not having to wake up to a buzzer is cool, though.</p>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>Overall, I’m pretty happy with this clock!
I can now open an eyelid, look at the time and fall asleep again, which is a massive quality-of-life improvement over the previous “fuck sleep I’ve got Instagram likes” situation.
The octagonal shape is a killer feature, I keep the clock angled 45° (as in the photo) and it really is the perfect angle for reading it while lying down.</p>
<p>One thing I’d like to improve in the future is to add a battery, because right now it’s solely USB powered and will obviously die if there’s a power outage. Adding a small LiPo battery and a charger circuit will be pretty easy and will ensure that the clock can keep running for hours even without power.</p>
<p>The source code is here:</p>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/stavros/do-not-be-alarmed">https://gitlab.com/stavros/do-not-be-alarmed</a></p>
<p>It’s not very complete, so use it at your own risk, and I haven’t really added deployment details, but it should be very easy to build with one PlatformIO command.</p>

							<p><em>TLDR: DuckDB now has full-text search functionality, similar to the FTS5 extension in SQLite. The main difference is that our FTS extension is fully formulated in SQL. We tested it out on TREC disks 4 and 5.</em></p>

<p>Searching through textual data stored in a database can be cumbersome, as SQL does not provide a good way of formulating questions such as “Give me all the documents about <strong>Mallard Ducks</strong>”: string patterns with <code>LIKE</code> will only get you so far. Despite SQL’s shortcomings here, storing textual data in a database is commonplace. Consider the table <code>products (id INT, name VARCHAR, description VARCHAR</code>) - it would be useful to search through the <code>name</code> and <code>description</code> columns for a website that sells these products.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>We expect a search engine to return us results within milliseconds. For a long time databases were unsuitable for this task, because they could not search large inverted indices at this speed: transactional database systems are not made for this use case. However, analytical database systems, can keep up with state-of-the art information retrieval systems. The company <a href="https://www.spinque.com/">Spinque</a> is a good example of this. At Spinque, MonetDB is used as a computation engine for customized search engines.</p>

<p>DuckDB’s FTS implementation follows the paper “<a href="https://hannes.muehleisen.org/SIGIR2014-column-stores-ir-prototyping.pdf">Old Dogs Are Great at New Tricks</a>”. A keen observation there is that advances made to the database system, such as parallelization, will speed up your search engine “for free”!</p>

<p>Alright, enough about the “why”, let’s get to the “how”.</p>

<h3 id="preparing-the-data">Preparing the Data</h3>
<p>The TREC 2004 Robust Retrieval Track has 250 “topics” (search queries) over TREC disks 4 and 5. The data consist of many text files stored in SGML format, along with a corresponding DTD (document type definition) file. This format is rarely used anymore, but it is similar to XML. We will use OpenSP’s command line tool <code>osx</code> to convert it to XML. Because there are many files, I wrote a bash script:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> latimes/xml
<span>for </span>i <span>in</span> <span>$(</span><span>seq</span> <span>-w</span> 1 9<span>)</span>
<span>do
        </span><span>cat </span>dtds/la.dtd latimes-<span>$i</span> | osx <span>&gt;</span> latimes/xml/latimes-<span>$i</span>.xml
<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This sorts the <code>latimes</code> files. Repeat for the <code>fbis</code>, <code>cr</code>, <code>fr94</code>, and <code>ft</code> files.</p>

<p>To parse the XML I used BeautifulSoup. Each document has a <code>docno</code> identifier, and a <code>text</code> field. Because the documents do not come from the same source, they differ in what other fields they have. I chose to take all of the fields.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>duckdb</span>
<span>import</span> <span>multiprocessing</span>
<span>import</span> <span>pandas</span> <span>as</span> <span>pd</span>
<span>import</span> <span>re</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that we have a dataframe, we can register it in DuckDB.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># create database connection and register the dataframe
</span><span>con</span> <span>=</span> <span>duckdb</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>database</span><span>=</span><span>'db/trec04_05.db'</span><span>,</span> <span>read_only</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span>
<span>con</span><span>.</span><span>register</span><span>(</span><span>'documents_df'</span><span>,</span> <span>documents_df</span><span>)</span>

<span># create a table from the dataframe so that it persists
</span><span>con</span><span>.</span><span>execute</span><span>(</span><span>"CREATE TABLE documents AS (SELECT * FROM documents_df)"</span><span>)</span>
<span>con</span><span>.</span><span>close</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This is the end of my preparation script, so I closed the database connection.</p>

<h3 id="building-the-search-engine">Building the Search Engine</h3>
<p>We can now build the inverted index and the retrieval model using a <code>PRAGMA</code> statement. The extension is <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/full_text_search">documented here</a>. We create an index table on table <code>documents</code> or <code>main.documents</code> that we created with our script. The column that identifies our documents is called <code>docno</code>, and we wish to create an inverted index on the fields supplied. I supplied all fields by using the ‘*’ shortcut.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>con</span> <span>=</span> <span>duckdb</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>database</span><span>=</span><span>'db/trec04_05.db'</span><span>,</span> <span>read_only</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span>
<span>con</span><span>.</span><span>execute</span><span>(</span><span>"PRAGMA create_fts_index('documents', 'docno', '*', stopwords='english')"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Under the hood, a parameterized SQL script is called. The schema <code>fts_main_documents</code> is created, along with tables <code>docs</code>, <code>terms</code>, <code>dict</code>, and <code>stats</code>, that make up the inverted index. If you’re curious what this look like, take a look at our source code under the <code>extension</code> folder in DuckDB’s source code!</p>

<h3 id="running-the-benchmark">Running the Benchmark</h3>
<p>The data is now fully prepared. Now we want to run the queries in the benchmark, one by one. We load the topics file as follows:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># the 'topics' file is not structured nicely, therefore we need parse some of it using regex
</span><span>def</span> <span>after_tag</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>tag</span><span>):</span>
    <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>findall</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>'&lt;'</span> <span>+</span> <span>tag</span> <span>+</span> <span>r</span><span>'&gt;([\s\S]*?)&lt;.*&gt;'</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>m</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>].</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>''</span><span>).</span><span>strip</span><span>()</span>

<span>topic_dict</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'../../trec/topics'</span><span>,</span> <span>'r'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span>
    <span>bs_content</span> <span>=</span> <span>bs</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>(),</span> <span>"lxml"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>top</span> <span>in</span> <span>bs_content</span><span>.</span><span>findChildren</span><span>(</span><span>'top'</span><span>):</span>
        <span>top_content</span> <span>=</span> <span>top</span><span>.</span><span>getText</span><span>()</span>
        <span># we need the number and title of each topic
</span>        <span>num</span> <span>=</span> <span>after_tag</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>top</span><span>),</span> <span>'num'</span><span>).</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>' '</span><span>)[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>
        <span>title</span> <span>=</span> <span>after_tag</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>top</span><span>),</span> <span>'title'</span><span>)</span>
        <span>topic_dict</span><span>[</span><span>num</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>title</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This gives us a dictionary that has query number as keys, and query strings as values, e.g. <code>301 -&gt; 'International Organized Crime'</code>.</p>

<p>We want to store the results in a specific format, so that they can be evaluated by <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/trec_eval.git">trec eval</a>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># create a prepared statement to make querying our document collection easier

        SELECT docno, score
        FROM scored_docs
        WHERE score IS NOT NULL
        ORDER BY score DESC
        LIMIT 1000)
    """</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>Now that we have created our ‘results’ file, we can compare them to the relevance assessments <code>qrels</code> using <code>trec_eval</code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./trec_eval <span>-m</span> P.30 <span>-m</span> map qrels results
map                     all 0.2324
P_30                    all 0.2948
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Not bad! While these results are not as high as the reproducible by <a href="https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/regressions-robust04.md">Anserini</a>, they are definitely acceptable. The difference in performance can be explained by differences in</p>
<ol>
  <li>Which stemmer was used (we used ‘porter’)</li>
  <li>Which stopwords were used (we used the list of 571 English stopwords used in the SMART system)</li>
  <li>Pre-processing (removal of accents, punctuation, numbers)</li>
  <li>BM25 parameters (we used the default k=1.2 and b=0.75, non-conjunctive)</li>
  <li>Which fields were indexed (we used all columns by supplying ‘*’)</li>
</ol>

<p>Retrieval time for each query was between 0.5 and 1.3 seconds on our machine, which will be improved with further improvements to DuckDB. I hope you enjoyed reading this blog, and become inspired to test out the extension as well!</p>

							<p>Today, the Norwegian Data Protection Authority issued an advance notification of a 100 million NOK (€ 9 600 000) fine to the dating app Grindr, as a result of a legal complaint filed by the Norwegian Consumer Council. </p><p>- This is a milestone in the ongoing work to ensure that consumers’ privacy is protected online. The Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) has clearly established that it is unacceptable for companies to collect and share personal data without user´s permission, Finn Myrstad, director of digital policy in the Norwegian Consumer Council said.</p>
<p>In 2020, the Norwegian Consumer Council <a href="https://www.forbrukerradet.no/side/new-study-the-advertising-industry-is-systematically-breaking-the-law/">revealed how many apps collect and share large amounts of sensitive information</a> without users’ knowledge. Based on these findings, the Consumer Council filed legal complaints, together with&nbsp;noyb, the European Center for Digital Right,&nbsp;against the dating app Grindr and five commercial partners for breaches of the&nbsp;General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>The Data Protection Authority has now upheld the Consumer Council’s&nbsp;complaint&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.datatilsynet.no/en/news/2021/intention-to-issue--10-million-fine-to-grindr-llc/">issued an advance notification of a 100 million NOK&nbsp;</a>(€ 9 600 000)&nbsp;one-time&nbsp;administrative&nbsp;fine, which amounts to 10 percent of Grindr’s global annual revenue.&nbsp;Grindr has until February 15th&nbsp;to provide comments or remarks&nbsp;on the decision.</p>

<p>-  This is excellent news and sends a clear signal that it’s illegal to monitor consumers without their consent 24/7 to collect and share their data. The GDPR does have teeth and consumer groups stand ready to act against those who break the law, Monique Goyens, Director General of The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC), said.</p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">– The message is simple: ‘take it or leave it’ is not consent. If you rely on unlawful ‘consent’ you are subject to a hefty fine.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The decision from the Norwegian Data Protection Authority&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">rules</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;that Grind</span><span data-contrast="auto">r</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;users were not given sufficient information about how personal data was collected and shared onward&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">with</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;third part</span><span data-contrast="auto">y companies</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Consumers&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">had to accept data sharing with third parties in order to use the app.</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">–&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">It is&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">great</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;that the Norwegian Data Protection A</span><span data-contrast="auto">u</span><span data-contrast="auto">thority&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">is taking</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;a lead</span><span data-contrast="auto">ing</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;role in enforcing the General Data Protection Regulation in Europe.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">–&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">There are many examples of how&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">personal data is used to manipulate everything from elections to targeting gambling ads against individuals struggling with addiction.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lately, there’s been renewed interest in clean, simple technology
built to help us focus. Protocols like <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">Gemini</a> strip away
the chaos of the web. Hardware hackers fit screens in
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://onezero.medium.com/smarter-mirrors-and-how-theyre-made-327997b9eff7">mirrors</a> and build beautiful minimalist displays to
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-morning-paper-revisited-35b407822494">read the news</a>, display data neatly in a <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://onezero.medium.com/meet-accent-352cfa95813a">picture
frame</a>, or provide a <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://healeycodes.com/hacking-together-an-e-ink-dashboard/">daily summary</a>. Hidden amongst
these many awesome projects is the <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://remarkable.com/">reMarkable 2</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve been using the reMarkable for the past month or so and it is a
seriously solid device. I use it mainly to take notes, at which it
excels. The e-ink display is the best I have ever seen, barely ever
refreshing the entire screen and almost entirely without the temporary
artifacts that plague similar devices. The pencil is comfortable to
use – slightly fuzzy – and, interestingly, entirely passive: it never
needs to charge. Given that it’s meant to replace your paper, it
shouldn’t be too surprising that the tablet’s also incredibly thin.</p>
<h2 id="cornellnotes"><a href="#cornellnotes" aria-label="Anchor link for: cornellnotes">##
</a>
cornellNotes</h2>
<p>In one of my classes, I’m required to take Cornell notes. On what may
be a related note, it’s a terrible class. Regardless, I need to get an
A and so notes I shall take. The reMarkable comes with a built-in
Cornell notes template. It’s slightly different than the format I’m
used to, but it fits the bill well enough.</p>
<p>It’s hard to describe the experience of using the device. I would
say that it feels shockingly natural. Using it to take notes feels
like writing on a clipboard with none of the usual annoyances – the
paper sliding, having finite pages; and all the benefits of a digital
device – sending files via email, OCR, a select-and-drag tool, etc.
It’s convenient, feels nice, and performs well. Most importantly, it
makes me <em>excited</em> to use it every time I turn it on.</p>
<h2 id="worksheet"><a href="#worksheet" aria-label="Anchor link for: worksheet">##
</a>
workSheet</h2>
<p>In another class, the instructor distributes worksheets every once in
a while to complete during class. Now that we’re in distance learning
due to COVID, these are <code>pdf</code>s – perfect for use with the reMarkable.</p>
<p>I download them onto my laptop, upload them through the app, and
voila. Look Mom, no scratch paper! I can write directly on the
worksheet. I’ve only started doing it this week, and it’s amazing.
Sure, there are programs on the computer that allow you to write
on a <code>pdf</code>, but doing math with a trackpad sounds like torture. With
the reMarkable, it’s enjoyable.</p>
<p>That’s the device’s biggest impact. I used to hate writing by hand.
I would beg my teachers to let me type assignments so I didn’t have
to use a pencil – what am I, a caveman? Now, my paper has superpowers.</p>
<h2 id="notkindle"><a href="#notkindle" aria-label="Anchor link for: notkindle">##
</a>
notKindle</h2>
<p>It’s also a suprisingly good reading device, with native support for
<code>epub</code>s and <code>pdf</code>s. It doesn’t have a backlight, but to be fair
neither do actual books so I’m not too bothered. The default font size
is quite large, and the UI is really minimal which makes for peaceful,
undistracted reading. I own two Kindles already, but I’ve taken to
using the reMarkable instead for a number of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>There’s no ads or tracking. On Kindle there’s an ad on the bottom
of the homescreen, which expands to the whole screen when you turn it
off – plus it sends every move you make to live forever with Big Papa
Bezos. Not so with the reMarkable.</li>
<li>The screen on the reMarkable is physically larger. Though sometimes
the compact size of my Kindle comes in handy, like when traveling,
having a nice big display is definitely an advantage. My Kindle is
closer to a large phone, and the reMarkable is definitely a tablet.</li>
<li>The reMarkable is a fairly open device. The Kindle, on the other
hand, is locked down and dripping with DRM (fairly easy to break but
still an encumberance).</li>
</ol>
<p>The developers have also made a browser extension for Chromium-based
browsers called <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/read-on-remarkable/bfhkfdnddlhfippjbflipboognpdpoeh">Read on reMarkable</a>, which I would love to see
the insides of but is unfortunately closed-source. Basically, it takes
any webpage, turns it into an <code>epub</code>, and sends it off to your device.
I love it and use it near constantly: whenever I run into anything on
HN that is either really long, or I just want to save for later, I
hit a button and it sends it to the tablet. Again, just incredibly
convenient.</p>
<h2 id="jailbreak"><a href="#jailbreak" aria-label="Anchor link for: jailbreak">##
</a>
jailBreak</h2>
<p>This section is titled “jailbreak,” which is actually a bit of
misnomer because the reMarkable runs Linux and you can <code>ssh</code> into it
with ease. It’s also not too fitting because I’m not just going to
talk about modifying the device, but also about official accessories.
My device came with a <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2/folios">Book Folio</a> and <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2/markers">Marker</a> in the
box, which is pretty good value. I did find out while writing this
that they offer a “Marker Plus” that comes with a built-in eraser. It
is, unfortunately, out of stock currently but I plan on buying it once
it returns in “January 2021,” so supposedly sometime in the next week
or so.</p>
<p>Ok now time for the jailbreak-y stuff. There’s an active community on
Freenode, an unofficial <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://remarkablewiki.com/">wiki</a>, and an <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/reHackable/awesome-reMarkable">Awesome list</a>.
All of these are really great resources for cool stuff you can do with
your device, and I’m planning to begin experimenting with them in the
coming weeks. My first goal is to get <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/koreader/koreader">KOReader</a> running so I
can sync my extensive Calibre library to the device. I’m going to
avoid adding any <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/reHackable/awesome-reMarkable#games">games</a> so as not to add additional complexity
to a device that aims to remove distractions, and proceed slowly so I
don’t brick my fancy new toy. Stick around to see how that goes.</p>
<h2 id="ps"><a href="#ps" aria-label="Anchor link for: ps">##
</a>
pS</h2>
<p>The recently published fairly viral <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://surma.dev/things/ditherpunk/index.html">Ditherpunk article</a>
by <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://surma.dev/">Surma</a> gives a really interesting overview of image
dithering. After reading the article, I noticed that the reMarkable
itself uses dithering to “fade off” your writing and make it look
like pencil. Neat.</p>
<p>Also, comparing the reMarkable to the Kindle makes me want to
jailbreak that too – I’ll find some time to look into that soon.</p>

            <div>
                


<div>
<p>- Our preliminary conclusion is that Grindr has shared user data to a number of third parties without legal basis, said Bjørn Erik Thon, Director-General of the Norwegian Data Protection Authority.</p>
<p>Grindr is a location-based social networking app for gay, bi, trans, and queer people. In 2020, <a href="https://www.forbrukerradet.no/side/complaints-against-grindr-and-five-third-party-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Norwegian Consumer Council filed a complaint against Grindr</a> claiming unlawful sharing of personal data with third parties for marketing purposes. The data shared include GPS location, user profile data, and the fact that the user in question is on Grindr.</p>
<p>Our preliminary conclusion is that Grindr needs consent to share these personal data and that Grindr’s consents were not valid. Additionally, we believe that the fact that someone is a Grindr user speaks to their sexual orientation, and therefore this constitutes special category data that merit particular protection.</p>
<p>- The Norwegian Data Protection Authority considers that this is a serious case. Users were not able to exercise real and effective control over the sharing of their data. Business models where users are pressured into giving consent, and where they are not properly informed about what they are consenting to, are not compliant with the law, said Bjørn Erik Thon, Director-General of the Norwegian Data Protection Authority.</p>
<h2>Invalid consents</h2>
<p>The Norwegian Data Protection Authority considers that as a general rule, consent is required for intrusive profiling and tracking practices for marketing or advertising purposes, for example those that involve tracking individuals across multiple websites, locations, devices, services or data-brokering. The same applies where a commercial app wishes to share data concerning users’ sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Users were forced to accept the privacy policy in its entirety to use the app, and they were not asked specifically if they wanted to consent to the sharing of their data with third parties. Furthermore, the information about the sharing of personal data was not properly communicated to users. We consider that this was contrary to the GDPR requirements for valid consent.</p>
<p>- Grindr is seen as a safe space, and many users wish to be discrete. Nonetheless, their data have been shared with an unknown number of third parties, and any information regarding this was hidden away, Thon added.</p>
<h2>Could result in highest Norwegian DPA fine to date</h2>
<p>An administrative fine should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.</p>
<p>- We have notified Grindr that we intend to impose a fine of high magnitude as our findings suggest grave violations of the GDPR. Grindr has 13.7 million active users, of which thousands reside in Norway. Our view is that these people have had their personal data shared unlawfully. An important objective of the GDPR is precisely to prevent <em>take-it-or-leave-it</em> “consents”. It is imperative that such practices cease, Thon emphasised.</p>
<p>We have found that Grindr has a worldwide annual turnover of at least USD $ 100&nbsp;000&nbsp;000. This means that our proposed fine will constitute approximately 10 % of the company’s turnover.</p>
<p>Our investigation has focused on the consent mechanism in place from the GDPR became applicable until April 2020, when Grindr changed how the app asks for consent. We have not to date assessed whether the subsequent changes comply with the GDPR.</p>
<h2>Not a final decision</h2>
<p>The document we have issued to Grindr is a draft decision. Grindr has been given the opportunity to comment on our findings within 15 February 2021. We will make our final decision once we have assessed any remarks the company may have.</p>
<p>Our draft decision concerns the free version of the Grindr app.</p>
<p>The Norwegian Consumer Council also filed complaints against five of the third parties receiving data from Grindr: MoPub (owned by Twitter Inc.), Xandr Inc. (formerly known as AppNexus Inc.), OpenX Software Ltd., AdColony Inc., and Smaato Inc. These cases are ongoing.</p>

<p>We made it into Iceland today! (No pictures of me in this post – I have horrible bed head at the moment, recovering from jet lag.)</p>



<p>As Americans, if we want to visit Iceland, we have a few choices:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Just drop in as a tourist for 90 days</strong> – except this is off-limits now due to the COVID19 travel bans</li><li><strong>Get a work permit and stay for years</strong> – this is what we’d originally planned to do when <a href="https://ozar.me/2020/10/were-planning-to-move-to-iceland-for-a-while/">I first shared that we were moving to Iceland for a while</a>. I had signed on to work part-time for an Icelandic company, a few days per month, in order to get a conventional work permit. However, my soon-to-be-employer had a shakeup, and rather than find another employer, we opted to…</li><li><strong>Get <a href="https://work.iceland.is/working/icelands-remote-work-long-term-visa">Iceland’s new teleworker visa</a></strong> – which lets you stay for 6 months per year as long as you’re from a country that wouldn’t normally need a tourist visa, and you can prove that you have a remote job that makes at least around $100K USD per year.</li></ul>



<p>The good news of using the teleworker visa:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_Iceland">Iceland’s internet infrastructure</a> is fantastic, with full 1Gbit/sec fiber available all over the country, making it easy to work remotely</li><li>I don’t have to work for someone else, and I don’t have to go into an office, so I can limit my possible exposure to COVID19</li><li>It doesn’t affect our tax status – we don’t have to pay extra income taxes in Iceland, just our normal US income taxes back home</li></ul>



<p>The bad news:</p>



<ul><li>It’s only good for 6 months per year – they’ve talked about raising that, but for now it’s still just 6 months</li><li>It’s not eligible for a permanent residency permit – if I’d have had a regular work permit and stayed for 4 years straight (less vacations), we could have gotten a permanent residency permit, so we were planning to build a house in Iceland – that’s off for now</li></ul>



<h3>The teleworker visa application process</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.utl.is/index.php/en/long-term-visa-for-remote-workers-and-their-family-members">teleworker visa application</a> is pretty simple, but can’t be done online: you have to send over real paper forms and passport photos. I would highly recommend shipping your application via a shipping company that includes signed proof of delivery and tracking. If you need help with the application process, <a href="https://www.workfromiceland.com/remotework">WorkFromIceland.com</a> offers an advisory package, but it costs thousands of dollars. (We didn’t use it, but I was tempted.)</p>



<p>After Iceland’s Directorate of Immigration receives your application, it goes into a bit of a black hole. We didn’t get email confirmation that our application was received, and <a href="https://www.utl.is/index.php/en/processing-time-and-applications-being-processed">Iceland’s immigration status page</a> doesn’t show what range of teleworker visas they’re working on. That page is only updated about once a month – if you apply, I’d recommend using a service like <a href="https://distill.io/">distill.io</a> to watch the page for changes.</p>



<p>We received approval via email after 5 weeks to process, but we had a few folks talking to the Iceland government on our behalf, so that might have sped things up. As we worked through the final logistics with the Directorate of Immigration, we found out that we were literally the very first people to get approvals for this new visa!</p>



<p>Iceland sends you a signed email confirmation, at which point you’re eligible to enter the country. You show this email to passport control as you enter Iceland, they check their databases, and in you go.</p>



<h3>Quarantining in Iceland</h3>



<p>Obviously this situation is very fluid, and I’m writing about the January 2021 situation. If you’re reading this later, check <a href="https://www.covid.is/english">covid.is</a> for the latest coronavirus travel restrictions.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="139" height="300" src="https://ozar.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Negative_COVID_19_test-139x300.png" alt="" srcset="https://ozar.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Negative_COVID_19_test-139x300.png 139w, https://ozar.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Negative_COVID_19_test-277x600.png 277w, https://ozar.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Negative_COVID_19_test-600x1299.png 600w, https://ozar.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Negative_COVID_19_test-768x1663.png 768w, https://ozar.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Negative_COVID_19_test.png 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 139px) 100vw, 139px"><figcaption>I passed!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>72 hours before you fly into Iceland, you have to <a href="https://visit.covid.is/">register for your free COVID19 test</a> and download the <a href="https://www.covid.is/app/en">Rakning C-19 app</a>. Iceland tracks you by your cell phone number, and the app helps the country do contact tracing.</p>



<p>When you arrive, you get a free COVID19 test at the airport. Because they’ve got testing gear centralized in one location, you get your results back in the app quickly – ours took just about 8 hours.</p>



<p>From the airport, you have to go into quarantine for 5 days. There are a set list of hotels that accept quarantining guests, or you can go to your house. You’re allowed to pick up a rental car, and if you have a long drive ahead of you, you can stay overnight in a quarantine hotel first before setting off on your journey – but only one night. Because there are storms in the north where we need to go, we decided to just do the whole quarantine at an approved hotel instead. Room service!</p>



<p>After 5 days, you get another free COVID19 test. (The date, time, and location are sent to you via email &amp; via the Rakning-C19 app within a day of you starting quarantine.) After you receive the all-clear from your second test’s results, then you’re done with quarantining. We’ll drive up north, settle into our rental house, set up my home studio. I’m teleworking again, teaching training classes starting February 1. Oh I think I’m supposed to say 1 Feb now. I’m European. (raises pinkie finger)</p>



<p>I’m not teleworking too hard though: during our stay here, we’re working 2 weeks a month, and spending the rest of the time seeing the amazing sights of Iceland.</p>



<p>If you’ve got any questions about the application process or arriving into Iceland, let me know.</p>

<p>I have a hobby. I like citing papers that provide strong evidence that is directly in opposition to what the authors claim. Lucky me, because PNAS just published a paper that fits snuggly into this category. It’s titled <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2016976118#sec-13">“Experienced well-being rises with income, even above $75,000 per year”</a>. An even better title would have been “Income is a poor gauge for well-being; don’t bother”.</p>



<p>This is the central figure:</p>



<figure><a href="https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1024x1013.png" alt="" width="475" height="469" srcset="https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1024x1013.png 1024w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-300x297.png 300w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-768x760.png 768w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-202x200.png 202w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image.png 1034w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px"></a></figure>



<p>Whoa! The paper doesn’t fail to mention (multiple times) how this is virtually a perfect linear relationship between well-being and log(income). The authors conclude that people with higher income are more satisfied with life and experience more well-being!</p>



<h2>The real-life version of this graph</h2>



<p>Let’s see what this graph looks like with a linear x-axis and with simulated raw data (see code below). The black dots are simulated individual participants from the study, assuming that statistical assumptions are met. Their exact distribution along the x-axis is not known (the author did not publish raw data), but that doesn’t matter. It only matters how the dots are dispersed for a given income. </p>

<p>You are one of the black dots. You could be one of the other black dots. But income does virtually nothing to lower or improve people’s well-being or life satisfaction. Income explained 1.5% and 4% of the variance in Well-Being and Life Satisfaction respectively (see code below).</p>



<blockquote><p>Income explained 1.5% and 4% of the variance in Well-Being and Life Satisfaction respectively</p></blockquote>



<h2>Extreme income rise = extreme happiness?</h2>



<p>Let’s study the most extreme case: you have an annual income of just $15,000. But now you get to jump into the life of a rich person all the way to the other side of the (linear) graph with an annual income of $480,000. The result of this 32-fold increase in income is expected to be:</p>



<ul><li>Life Satisfaction: 62% used to rate higher than you. Now only 35% does! But there’s a 24% chance that you will be <em>less</em> happy than before.</li><li>Experienced Well-Being: 58% used to rate higher than you. Now only 40% does! But there’s a 33% chance that you will be <em>less</em> happy than before.</li></ul>



<p>Hmm, hardly the extreme happiness rush that one might expect would expect from reading the paper and the ensuing media coverage. It’s a vanishingly small effect, considering the extremeness of this example. </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I think it’s fairer to say that we’ve now learned that this paper is solid evidence that income is a really poor gauge for happiness. Someone once wrote a song about this:</p>



<figure><img src="https://25.media.tumblr.com/bf7724c5134e8d05cef1d8431e8c1ad1/tumblr_mh1jcs8zyE1rhssuho1_500.gif" alt="money can't buy me love the beatles gif"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://wifflegif.com/gifs/51599-money-cant-buy-me-love-the-beatles-gif">https://wifflegif.com/gifs/51599-money-cant-buy-me-love-the-beatles-gif</a></figcaption></figure>



<h2>Code</h2>



<p>Computing quantiles and probability of deterioration is simple. The z-score is your score relative to the whole population in units of standard deviations. So just the results for Life Satisfaction were obtained by reading off the extremes of the graph and computing the associated quantiles in R: <code>pnorm(-0.3)</code> and <code>pnorm(0.4)</code>. Probability of negative income change is then just <code>pnorm(-0.3, 0.4)</code>.</p>



<p>The plots are fairly straightforward too. First, let’s simulate the raw data:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="r" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group=""># Data
N = 33391  # Number of participants
incomes = exp(seq(log(15000), log(480000), length.out = N))  # x-axis of Figure 1
trend_wb = seq(-0.2, 0.25, length.out = N)  # Linear, read off Figure 1
trend_ls = seq(-0.3, 0.4, length.out = N)   # Linear, read off Figure 1
z_wb = rnorm(N, trend_wb)  # z-score is standard normal
z_ls = rnorm(N, trend_ls)  # z-score is standard normal

# Merge the data in long format
df = data.frame(
  incomes,
  z = c(rnorm(N, z_wb), rnorm(N, z_ls)),
  outcome = c(rep("Experienced Well-Being", N), rep("Life Satisfaction", N))
)
</pre>



<p>Now let’s plot it:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="r" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">ggplot(df, aes(x = incomes, y = z)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1, size = 0.3) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = c(trend_wb, trend_ls), color = outcome), lwd = 2) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 75000, lty = 2, lwd = 1, color = "#555555") + 
  facet_wrap(~outcome) + 
  #scale_x_continuous(trans = "log", breaks = c(15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480) * 1000) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480) * 1000, labels = scales::label_number_auto()) + 
  labs(x = "Houshold income", y = "z-scored well-being") + 
  theme_bw(13) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
</pre>



<p>If you want to verify other results, you can fit the linear models to the (simulated) data and see that we can approximately replicate the r-values reported in the paper (r = 0.17 and r = 0.09) and that this correspond to 4% and 1.5% variance explained, respectively:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="r" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">summary(lm(z_ls ~ log(incomes)))
summary(lm(z_wb ~ log(incomes)))</pre>



<p>I leave it as an exercise to the reader to filter out <code>nonlow_incomes = incomes[incomes &gt; 30000]</code> and assess the predictive performance (<code>lm(z_ls ~ log(nonlow_incomes)</code>).</p>

<h3>Anna Novakov and T. Novakov</h3>
<p><em>like a yellow silken scarf, the thick fog hangs along the quay[1]</em></p>
<p>In the 1880s, London’s frequent and well-documented episodes of fog were a phenomenon unique to England’s most densely populated, diverse, and industrialized urban center. The spectacular nature of the embankment fog, often described by eyewitnesses as changeable and even colorful, caught the imagination of many artists and writers who saw in these atmospheric manifestations a symbol of modernity and the role of industrialization on an evolving urban space. While the illusive city, shrouded in winter fog, created the perfect backdrop for mysterious, criminal activity, it also proved to be a compelling inspiration for those who read the fog as a more positive symbol of London’s cosmopolitan status. In this essay, we seek to interrelate some artistic and literary references to the fog with contemporary explanations addressing the causes of this atmospheric phenomenon. Through this interdisciplinary approach, we hope to shed light on the physical, artistic and even psychological implications of Victorian air pollution.[2]</p>
<p>Expansions of industrial activity during the later half of the 19th century resulted in frequent and severe air pollution episodes. In London, the smoke that billowed as a result of domestic and industrial coal burning began mixing with existing natural fog. Charles Dickens wrote in Bleak House that “smoke lowering down from chimney-pots, making a soft black drizzle, with flakes of soot in it as big as full-grown snowflakes –- gone into mourning, one might imagine, for the death of the sun.”[3] The resulting smog (word coined from smoke + fog), was often sited by both visitors and locals as an optical experience unique to London. These low-laying fogs reduced visibility in the city to less than a mile while resulting in the loss of up to fifty percent of the sunshine in the winter months.[4] Thomas Hardy mentions it is in his 1900 poem “The Darkling Rush” as</p>
<p>I leant upon a coppice gate,<br>
When Frost was spectre-gray,<br>
And Winter’s dregs made desolate<br>
The weakening eye of day.<br>
The tangled bine-stems scored the sky<br>
Like strings of broken lyres,<br>
And all mankind that haunted nigh<br>
Had sought their household fires.[5]</p>
<p>While writer Arthur Symons wrote that “In London, men work as if in darkness, scarcely seeing their own hands . . . and not knowing the meaning of their labour.”[6] French writer Joris-Karl Huyseman likewise wrote in 1884 that “A rainy, colossal London smelling of molten metal and of soot, ceaselessly streaming and smoking in the fog now spread out before his eyes . . . All this was transpiring in vast warehouses along the river banks which were bathed by the muddy and dull water of an imaginary Thames . . . while trains rushed past at full speed or rumbled underground uttering horrible cries and vomiting waves of smoke, and while, through every street, monstrous and gaudy and infamous advertisements flared through the eternal twilight.”[7]</p>
<p>In Jayati Gupta’s essay “London Through Alien Eyes,” published in Literary London: Interdisciplinary Studies in the Representation of London, he references Madame Krishnabhabini Das’ 1880s London experiences. She noted that “this sort of fog persists through the day and assumes different hues – sometimes ashen – sometimes black – sometimes yellow.” Another eye witness L.C.W. Bonacina gave this insightful description of yellow fog’s evolution “A really bad nineteenth century fog appeared early in the morning as a thick white mist, like the country fog, only dirtier. With the lighting of the fires it would soon become yellow and pungent, irritating the throat and eyes, till midday the continued outpouring of chimney products would have turned the fog a sooty brownish black causing the darkness of night.” Furthermore he added that, “During summer months major fogs were virtually unknown in the nineteenth century just as they are in the twentieth.”[8]</p>
<p>These, and other more contemporary reports most often described the yellow hue prevalent in London fog. Oscar Wilde noted the yellow hue in his poem “Impression du Matin”:</p>
<p>The Thames nocturne of blue and gold<br>
Changed to a Harmony in grey:<br>
A barge with ochre-coloured hay<br>
Dropt from the wharf: and chill and cold<br>
The yellow fog came creeping down<br>
The bridges, till the houses’ walls<br>
Seemed changed to shadows and St. Paul’s<br>
Loomed like a bubble o’er the town.[9]</p>
<p>Bonacina’s chromatic observations can certainly be credited to the predominance of domestic coal burning. Tars from low temperature coal combustion in the morning were yellow. The yellow tar, created in the morning, was soluble in fog water and thus colored the fog droplets creating the appearance of chromatic fog. Later in the day, emissions from industry, steam locomotives and ships increased coinciding with the darkening fogs. Tar produced in these higher temperatures took on a dark brown coloration. Atmospheric chemist Peter Brimblecombe proposed the following three possible origins for the yellow fog: (i) light scattering by smoke particles above the fog such that it was illuminated by yellowish light, (ii) the gas and weak electric light gave the fog a yellowish hue at night, and (iii) tarry compounds actually colored the fog, giving preference to the latter possibility.[10]</p>
<p>Victorian writers, noted with some frequency additional chromatic effects produced by the modern fog. In 1899, an article was published in The Artist magazine that read “There’s nothing to be seen like it ever – in any town in Europe. They say it’s due to the smoke and it may be; but just look at it. Look at the purple and crimson, the scarlet and gold . . . until with just the tiniest fleck of pink it sinks into the palest green.”[11] Aaron Watson, in an article in the Magazine of Art, suggests that the city “enfolds all ugliness in a purple haze.”[12] Charles Dickens in his novel Our Mutual Friend notes that “Even in the surrounding country it was a foggy day, but there the fog was great, whereas in London it was, at about the boundary line, dark yellow, and a little within it brown, and then browner, and then browner, until at the heart of the City — which call Saint Mary Axe – it was rustic black.”[13]</p>
<p>Visual artists, such as French painter Claude Monet, witnessed the yellow fogs as well as a variety of additional chromatic atmospheric effects. For Monet, London’s varied fogs were a spectacular manifestation of turn-of-century city life -– an optical phenomenon that he captured in a well documented and frequently referenced series of canvases.</p>
<p>London was a magical place for Monet. He beamed “I so love London! But I love it only in winter. It’s nice in summer with its parks, but nothing like it is in winter with the fog, for without the fog, London wouldn’t be a beautiful city. It’s the fog that gives it its magnificent breadth. Those massive, regular blocks become grandiose within that mysterious cloak.”[14] In 1900 he added that “The weather is magnificent but unsettled . . . I can’t begin to describe a day as wonderful as this. One [colored] marvel, after another each lasting less than five minutes, it was enough to drive one mad. No country could be more extraordinary for a painter.”[15]</p>
<p>The constantly changing chromatic effects of London’s fog were unusual and bear little resemblance to contemporary atmospheric phenomena. To understand this unique development it is vital to discuss the evidence for these chromatic fogs. Taking into account the lack of scientific, measurement-based observations, we would like to employ artistic production, such as Monet’s Thames series, as indirect evidence –- source material that forms the basis for a broader explanatory discussion of this form of air pollution.</p>
<p>Between 1898 and 1901, Monet made numerous extended trips to London. Working from an upscale Savoy Hotel suite, he created numerous paintings of the Waterloo and Charing Cross Bridges. As an accomplished and sensitive colorist, Monet found himself captivated by London’s fog and its spectacular optical appearance, which he referred to as l’enveloppe. Of particular relevance to this essay is Monet’s description “The fog in London assumes all sorts of colors; there are black, brown, yellow, green, [and] purple fogs.”[16] Was the colored fog depicted in these paintings and referenced in written accounts a subjective interpretation of the London’s cityscape or documentary evidence of London’s timely and transient atmospheric effects?</p>
<p>These hazy, colorful paintings are certainly marvelous Impressionist interpretations of the city’s skyline. The chromatic effects that Monet was trying to capture in the bridge scenes were fleeting and momentary. The changeable weather conditions of the morning fog and winter color palette, forced the artist to work on stacks of canvases at the same time. Monet recalled that “At the Savoy Hotel . . . from which I looked at my points of view, I had up to a hundred canvases under way –- of the same subject. By searching among the sketches feverishly, I chose one of them that didn’t differ too much from what I saw; despite everything, I altered it completely. When work was finished, I would notice, in moving my canvases, that I had overlooked precisely the one that would have suited me best and which I had at hand.”[17] Monet’s artistic output and his frantic attempts to capture fleeting effects are visual evidence of the changing and colorful atmospheric effects he witnessed.</p>
<p>For Monet, the Waterloo Bridge took on many manifestations depending on the time of day and visual effects of the fog. The bridge appears as mauve semi-circles in the Chicago Art Institute’s version of the Waterloo Bridge. The painting foreground focuses our eye on surface effects of undulating droplets of colored water. Receding into the background, factory chimneys reinforce the arches of the bridge while further bisecting Monet’s composition. …</p></div></article></div></div></section></div></div></div>

A <strong>Platformer</strong> investigation has found:</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Signal appears to have more than 40 million users, up from approximately 20 million last month</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The company is actively developing features related to user names and cryptocurrency payments, potentially creating new avenues for abuse</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>At least one employee quit Signal in recent weeks over concerns that the 6-year-old company does not have a content policy and has resisted developing one</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton has become heavily involved in daily operations, interviewing engineers and writing code</strong> </p></li><li><p><strong>CEO Moxie Marlinspike tells Platformer: “The thing about software is that you never can fully anticipate everything. We just have to be willing to iterate.”</strong></p></li></ul><p>On January 6th, WhatsApp users around the world began seeing a pop-up message notifying them of upcoming changes to the service’s privacy policy. The changes were designed to enable businesses to send and store messages to WhatsApp’s 2 billion-plus users, but they came with an ultimatum: agree by February 8th, or you can no longer use the app.</p><p>The resulting furor sparked a backlash that led Facebook-owned WhatsApp to delay the policy from taking effect until May. In the meantime, though, tens of millions of users began seeking alternatives to Facebook’s suite of products. Among the biggest beneficiaries has been Signal, the encrypted messaging app whose development is funded by a nonprofit organization. Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">according to one research firm</a>, the six-year-old app had about 20 million users worldwide. But in a 12-hour period the Sunday after WhatsApp’s privacy policy update began, Signal added another 2 million users, an employee familiar with the matter told me. Days of temporary outages followed.</p><p>The pace has hardly relented since. Signal leapt to No. 1 in the app stores of 70 countries, and it continues to rank near the top of most of them, including the United States. While the company won’t confirm the size of its user base, a second employee told me the app has now surpassed 40 million users globally. And while Signal still has a small fraction of the market for mobile messaging — Telegram, another upstart messenger, <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1352368555711365121">says it added 90 million active users in January alone</a> —&nbsp;the rapid growth has been a cause for excitement inside the small distributed team that makes the app.</p><p>Adding millions of users has served as a vindication for a company that has sought to build a healthier internet by adopting different incentives than most Silicon Valley companies.</p><p>“We're organized as a nonprofit because we feel like the way the internet currently works is insane,” CEO Moxie Marlinspike told me. “And a lot of that insanity, to us, is the result of bad business models that produce bad technology. And they have bad societal outcomes.” Signal’s mission, by contrast, is to promote privacy through end-to-end encryption, without any commercial motive.</p><p>But Signal’s rapid growth has also been a cause for concern. In the months leading up to and following the 2020 US presidential election, Signal employees raised questions about the development and addition of new features that they fear will lead the platform to be used in dangerous and even harmful ways. But those warnings have largely gone unheeded, they told me, as the company has pursued a goal to hit 100 million active users and generate enough donations to secure Signal’s long-term future.</p><p>Employees worry that, should Signal fail to build policies and enforcement mechanisms to identify and remove bad actors, the fallout could bring more negative attention to encryption technologies from regulators at a time when their existence is threatened around the world.</p><p>“The world needs products like Signal — but they also need Signal to be thoughtful,” said Gregg Bernstein, a former user researcher who left the organization this month over his concerns. “It’s not only that Signal doesn’t have these policies in place. But they’ve been resistant to even considering what a policy might look like.”</p><p>Interviews with current and former employees, plus leaked screenshots of internal deliberations, paint a portrait of a company that is justly proud of its role in promoting privacy while also willfully dismissing concerns over the potential misuses of its service. Their comments raise the question of whether a company conceived as a rebuke to data-hungry, ad-funded communication tools like Facebook and WhatsApp will really be so different after all.</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>Like a lot of problems, this one started with an imperative familiar to most businesses: growth.</p><p>Encrypted messaging has been a boon to activists, dissidents, journalists, and marginalized groups around the world. Not even Signal itself can see their messages —&nbsp;much less law enforcement or national security agencies. The app saw a surge in usage during last year’s protests for racial justice, even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280112/signal-face-blurring-tool-ios-android-update">adding a tool to automatically blur faces</a> in photos to help activists more safely share images of the demonstrations. This kind of growth, one that supported progressive causes, was exciting to Signal’s roughly 30-member team.</p><p>“That's the kind of use case that we really want to support,” Marlinspike told me. “People who want more control over their data and how it's used — and who want to exist outside the gaze of tech companies.”</p><p>On October 28th, <a href="https://signal.org/blog/group-links/">Signal added group links</a>, a feature that has become increasingly common to messaging apps. With a couple of taps, users could begin creating links that would allow anyone to join a chat in a group as large as 1,000 people. And because the app uses end-to-end encryption, Signal itself would have no record of the group’s title, its members, or the image the group chose as its avatar. At the same time, the links make it easy for activists to recruit large numbers of people onto Signal simultaneously, with just a few taps.</p><p>But as the US presidential election grew closer, some Signal employees began raising concerns that group links could be abused. On September 29th, during a debate, President Trump had told the far-right extremist group the Proud Boys to “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-race-and-ethnicity-donald-trump-chris-wallace-0b32339da25fbc9e8b7c7c7066a1db0f">stand back and stand by</a>.” During an all-hands meeting, an employee asked Marlinspike how the company would respond if a member of the Proud Boys or another extremist organization posted a Signal group chat link publicly in an effort to recruit members and coordinate violence.</p><p>“The response was: if and when people start abusing Signal or doing things that we think are terrible, we'll say something,” said Bernstein, who was in the meeting, conducted over video chat. “But until something is a reality, Moxie's position is he's not going to deal with it.”</p><p>Bernstein (disclosure: a former colleague of mine at Vox Media), added, “You could see a lot of jaws dropping. That’s not a strategy —&nbsp;that’s just hoping things don’t go bad.”&nbsp;</p><p>Marlinspike’s response, he told me in a conversation last week, was rooted in the idea that because Signal employees cannot see the content on their network, the app does not need a robust content policy. Like almost all apps, its terms of service state that the product cannot be used to violate the law. Beyond that, though, the company has sought to take a hands-off approach to moderation.</p><p>“We think a lot on the product side about what it is that we're building, how it's used, and the kind of behaviors that we're trying to incentivize,” Marlinspike told me. “The overriding theme there is that we don't want to be a media company. We’re not algorithmically amplifying content. We don’t have access to the content. And even within the app, there are not a lot of opportunities for amplification.”</p><p>At the same time, employees said, Signal is developing multiple tools simultaneously that could be ripe for abuse. For years, the company has faced complaints that its requirement that people use real phone numbers to create accounts <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9kaxge/how-to-use-signal-without-giving-out-your-phone-number-a-gendered-security-issue">raises privacy and security concerns</a>. And so Signal has begun working on an alternative: letting people create unique usernames. But usernames (and display names, should the company add those, too) could enable people to impersonate others — a scenario the company has not developed a plan to address, despite completing much of the engineering work necessary for the project to launch.</p><p>Signal has also been actively exploring the addition of payments into the app. Internally, this has been presented as a way to help people in developing nations transfer funds more easily. But other messaging apps, including Facebook and China’s WeChat, have pursued payments as a growth strategy.</p><p>An effort from Facebook to develop a cryptocurrency, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/facebook-rebrands-libra-wallet-service-calibra-to-novi/#:~:text=Today%2C%20Facebook%20announced%20that%20Calibra%20has%20a%20new%20name%2C%20Novi.&amp;text=The%20Libra%20blockchain%20is%20supposed,%E2%80%9Cvia%E2%80%9D%20(way).">now known as Diem</a>, has been <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2019/11/05/libras-regulatory-hurdles-appear-taller-after-house-hearing/">repeatedly derailed</a> by skeptical regulators.</p><p>Marlinspike has served as an adviser to MobileCoin, a cryptocurrency built on the Stellar blockchain designed to make payments simple and secure —&nbsp;and, potentially, impossible to trace. “The idea of MobileCoin is to build a system that hides everything from everyone,” <em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/">Wired</a></em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/"> wrote of the project in 2017</a>. “These components make MobileCoin more resistant to surveillance, whether it's coming from a government or a criminal.”</p><p>People I spoke with told me they regard the company’s exploration of cryptocurrency as risky since it could invite more bad actors onto the platform and attract regulatory scrutiny from world leaders.&nbsp;</p><p>Marlinspike played down the potential of crypto payments in Signal, saying only that the company had done some “design explorations” around the idea. But significant engineering resources have been devoted to developing MobileCoin integrations in recent quarters, former employees said.&nbsp;</p><p>“If we did decide we wanted to put payments into Signal, we would try to think really carefully about how we did that,” Marlinspike said. “It’s hard to be totally hypothetical.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>III.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Signal’s growth imperatives are driven in part by its unusual corporate structure. The app is funded by the Signal Foundation, which was created in 2018 with a $50 million loan from WhatsApp co-founder …</p></div></div>

    <p>Over the past several weeks, GameStop stock has traded more like a cryptocurrency than a failing mall-based retailer.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/gme.png" alt="GameStop"></p>

<p>What is going on here?</p>

<p>In one sentence: Institutional investors short GameStop (i.e., the prevailing wisdom, at least until the past few weeks) are playing a game of chicken with retail investors &amp; contrarian institutions who are long. [1]</p>

<h3 id="the-current-situation">The Current Situation</h3>

<p>GameStop is a video game retailer; it has been in decline for several years now. Video games have moved to an online, direct-to-consumer distribution model. Foot traffic in malls (where most GameStops are located) was down even before COVID; many mall-based retailers are struggling.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, over the course of 2020 this led to GameStop becoming one of the <a href="https://www.highshortinterest.com/">most shorted stocks</a> on Wall Street.</p>

<p>However, there were early signs that GameStop was undervalued. Michael Burry (of <em>The Big Short</em> fame) <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-michael-burry-big-short-stock-next-gen-discs-2019-8">took a large long position in 2019</a>, claiming video game discs are not entirely dead. In August 2020, Roaring Kitty (a.k.a. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DeepFuckingValue/">u/DeepFuckingValue</a> on Reddit) published a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alntJzg0Um4">video</a> detailing why GameStop was a good play based on its fundamentals – a future short squeeze would just be the icing on the cake.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/michael_burry.jpg" alt="Michael Burry"></p>

<p>On January 11th, Ryan Cohen (founder of <a href="https://www.chewy.com/">Chewy</a>, which sold to PetSmart for $3.35 billion), <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chewy-co-founder-joins-gamestops-board-after-pushing-overhaul-11610378574">joined GameStop’s board</a> after his investment firm built up a 10% stake in the company. At this point, retail investors, especially those on the popular subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">Wall Street Bets</a> went crazy. They highlighted that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/">GameStop was now a growth play</a>. It is now led by a previously successful founder, its online business is growing at a 300% rate, and it is in the process of turning around its core business. [2] As such, GameStop should be valued at a Venture Capital multiple of 10x+ revenue, rather than a measly 0.5x revenue.</p>

<p>This narrative is compelling. Despite short sellers warning otherwise, GameStop has continued to climb in price. All of the GameStop options issued (with a high strike price of $60) were in the money on Friday (1/22/2021), trigging a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2txra/that_was_a_margin_call/gk87z17/">gamma squeeze</a> as institutions who had written the options rushed to cover their positions. GameStop closed Friday at $65.01.</p>

<p>On Monday (1/25/2021), GameStop opened at $96.73, spiked at $159.18 (likely because of another gamma squeeze), [3] then crashed with pressure from institutional shorts, closing at $76.79 (still up 18% day-over-day).</p>

<p>But the bulls aren’t finished with GameStop. These gamma squeezes are nothing compared to what will be coming: the near-mythical “Infinity Squeeze”. Most famously seen with <a href="https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/">Volkswagen in 2008</a>, when short sellers are forced to cover their positions due to a margin call, the price of the stock rapidly rises (hypothetically to infinity) since the number of shares shorted exceeds the number of shares available to buy.</p>

<h3 id="the-allure-of-wall-street-bets">The Allure of Wall Street Bets</h3>

<p>Can a subreddit comprised of retail investors really move the market like this? I doubt it – all of the big swings in this stock have been caused by institutions. What this subreddit does is <strong>control the narrative</strong>.</p>

<p>First unveiled to the mainstream finance world in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/reddit-s-profane-greedy-traders-are-shaking-up-the-stock-market">February 2020 Bloomberg article</a>, Wall Street Bets is profane (as I’m sure you’ve noticed if you clicked any of the links in this post). But Wall Street Bets isn’t some sinister, market-manipulating entity. Rather, it is a virtual water cooler for individual retail investors to post memes – and emojis, oh so many emojis – about their investments.</p>

<p>Reading Wall Street Bets feels like the discussion at a middle school cafeteria table circa 2000. Redditors on Wall Street Bets (who refer to themselves affectionately as “autists” or “retards”) [4] encourage one another to have “diamond hands” (💎 🤲), the will to stay strong and not sell a stock when things are going poorly. Contrast this with the “paper hands” (🧻 🤲) of those who are weak-willed and sell a stock based on market sentiment. Companies are headed “to the moon” (🚀). Bears are not mentioned without the adjective “gay” (🌈 🐻). Self-deprecating cuckold references to “my wife’s boyfriend” abound.</p>

<p>Despite this language (or perhaps because of it), Wall Street Bets is one of the most entertaining and informative places on the internet. People post meaningful analysis of companies that are undervalued and why they are investing. Browsing the subreddit, you get a crash course on concepts that you would otherwise learn only at a buy-side firm or working as an options trader: EBITDA multiple, book value, delta hedging, implied volatility.</p>

<p>But the most compelling aspect of Wall Street Bets is in its name: the bets. The ability to gain (or lose) a life-changing amount of money – with screenshots to prove it – creates an environment similar to that of the casino floor. And if Wall Street Bets is the casino floor, then Wall Street itself is the house.</p>

<p>The same emotion that caused us to root for the thieves in <em>Ocean’s 11</em> is what makes Wall Street Bets so enticing. Put frankly, Millennials are tired of getting fucked by the man. When you’re underemployed with $100,000 in student loan debt, your financial situation feels overwhelming. You really don’t want to take the advice of your parents or CNBC talking heads [5] to invest 10% of your salary for a 4% annual return. At that point, what’s another $5,000? Might as well buy some short-dated GME calls.</p>

<p>For those of use who don’t fit the underemployed Millennial archetype, Matt Levine’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-04-30/if-you-re-bored-you-can-trade-stocks">Boredom Markets Hypothesis</a> applies. COVID has required us to work from home, without much ability to spend for travel, dining, or entertainment. Putting money into Robinhood is a decent substitute – with the added bonus of it being an “investment”, rather than consumption. In an age where the Fed will print seemingly unlimited money to prop up capital markets, better to be irrational exuberant as a part of the market than be left out of the party.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/money_printer.jpg" alt="money printer go brrrrr"></p>

<p>Further, the narrative presented by the GameStop trade in particular is compelling. It allows the small retail investor to play a role in market events normally only played out at the hedge fund scale (a short squeeze was a key plot element in Season 1 of <em>Billions</em>). The short sellers in this case aren’t particularly sympathetic: Andrew Left of <a href="https://citronresearch.com/">Citron Research</a> released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEi2axM4hwI">video</a> in which he lays out the bear case for GameStop. His main argument was a smug appeal to authority, essentially claiming “Wall Street knows better than you people on message boards”. [6]</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/short_squeeze.jpg" alt="Billions Short Squeeze"></p>
<p>Billions, IRL (image via <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2016/02/09/billions-for-the-99-episode-4-what-it-means-to-face-a-short-squeeze/?sh=5d3100f36d69">Forbes</a>)</p>

<p>So sure, Wall Street Bets is irreverent, has irrational exuberance, and is guilty of hero worship (Elon Musk and more recently Ryan Cohen). But it also provides a sense of community during the stresses of COVID and provides a compelling way for the little guy to stick it to the man.</p>

<p>As Keynes reminded us (in the most overused finance quote of all time): <em>“The markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.”</em> When enough people believe in a vision, it can cause that vision to manifest itself. <a href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/gamestop-and-the-dangerous-game-of-gamma-squeezes-15546125">Wall Street is scared</a> that retail investors can manifest their own vision, rather that the one dictated by the major financial players.</p>

<h3 id="what-george-soros-got-right">What George Soros Got Right</h3>

<p>The entire GameStop scenario is a case study in reflexivity. [7] Reflexivity is the idea that our perception of circumstances influences reality, which then further impacts our perception of reality, in a self-reinforcing loop. Specifically, in a financial market, prices are a reflection of traders’ expectations. Those prices then influence traders’ expectations, and so on.</p>

<p>This may seem obvious to some, but it flies in the face of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis">efficient-market hypothesis</a>. As Soros states,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What makes reflexivity interesting is that the prevailing bias has ways, via the market prices, to affect the so-called fundamentals that market prices are supposed to reflect. [8]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does this mean for GameStop? Because of traders’ bullish sentiment, a previously failing company is now in the position where it can leverage the overnight increase in value to make real, substantive changes to its business. GameStop can pay off debt through the issuance of new shares or make strategic acquisitions using its newly-valuable shares. [9] A struggling company could become solid simply not because of a change in the underlying business, but because investors <strong>decided it should be more valuable</strong>.</p>

<p>Reflexivity may be the best way to understand the 21st Century. <a href="https://emerging.substack.com/p/peak-reflexivity">Passive investing is an example of reflexivity in action</a>. [10] So is winner-take-all venture investing. Uber raised an absurd war chest, causing more investors to want to pile in, which led to more fundraising and eventually a successful IPO. The fact that Uber has not yet turned a profit, yet today has a $100 billion market cap, cannot be explained with traditional financial thinking, but can be explained by reflexivity.</p>

<p>The internet and instant communication only accelerates these trends. Instances of reflexivity like the strange market movements we’ve seen with GameStop are happening more and more – not only in financial markets, but also in the political and social realm, to incredible effect.</p>

<p>When Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016, I distinctly remember writing in my journal: <em>“Anything is possible.”</em> I was blown away that this complete buffoon of a man, someone who the Huffington Post <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-note-about-our-coverage-of-donald-trumps-campaign_n_55a8fc9ce4b0896514d0fd66">refused to cover as politics</a> meme-d his way into the presidency. He was a joke, until suddenly, in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulpa">Tulpa-esque</a> twist…he wasn’t. Similarly, internet conspiracy theories spread via Facebook memes manifested themselves in the real world when Trump supporters <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol">stormed the Capitol</a> a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>Our perception shapes reality. And when enough people agree on a specific perception, it becomes reality. [11] As we become more and more connected, discourse will expand and and accelerate. We’re going to see some strange things become reality.</p>

<p>Even, perhaps, hedge funds going bankrupt and newly-minted …</p></div></div>

January 25, 2021 | https://www.weskao.com/blog/how-to-instantly-show-your-value | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.weskao.com/blog/how-to-instantly-show-your-value">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-f7b3cf53449abc80ad4f"><div><p>Happy new year from Toronto!</p><p>I’ve compiled my favorite ways to convey your product’s value prop. These apply to products and brands, but feel free to apply this to people too. These work for job interviews, selling yourself as a consultant, etc.</p><p><strong>Use before-and-after</strong>: <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/comparisons-heighten-drama" target="_blank">Everyone loves a good before-and-after contrast</a>. Before-and-afters are a powerful application of the idea of “show not tell.” That’s why you see so many before-and-afters when scrolling through your feed: weight loss (not-your-best self vs toned/healthy), home renovation (dingy bathroom vs shiny new renovation), messaging copy (bad writing vs strong writing), etc. A before-and-after is like a jump cut that skips all the boring parts--it emphasizes contrast, which heightens drama and interest. When talking about yourself, show what a project was like before you arrived and what it looked like after your contributions.</p><p><strong>Show, not tell</strong>: I recently came across AI-driven software that reduces background noise on calls. The thing that caught my eye on their homepage is the toggle “on” and “off” button where you can hear a sound sample without their tool versus how much sharper the sound is with their tool. It was pretty incredible and instantly sold me. As a marketer, I’m always on the lookout for <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/case-study-dissecting-an-everyday-story" target="_blank">when I change my mind</a>. It’s hard to change people’s minds, so when it happens successfully, try to learn what worked. Think of how you can demonstrate the value of your product like this.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610079443099_26862"><div><p><strong>Experiential, temporal, sensory</strong>: It’s hard for most brands to describe your product’s value quickly. It’s especially hard if your product has an experiential, temporal, or sensory component.&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><em>Experiential</em>: How do you convey a sense of community and belonging? The altMBA had this challenge. In-person courses had websites that showed photos of participants drawing on post-its and pointing at white boards. But our course was entirely online. Photos of people sitting at a computer would hardly do justice. We ended up using screenshots of Zoom gallery view among other things. Not perfect, but we chose to rely less on photography and more on other design elements given this constraint.</p></li><li><p><em>Temporal</em>: How do you convey the value of your product if it lasts 10x longer than competitors who are selling for cheaper? How do you convey the value or benefit of your product if there’s no immediate benefit in a world that loves instant gratification? Think of examples of products you’ve purchased where there’s less immediate value but more long-term value, and how the value prop was positioned.</p></li><li><p><em>Sensory</em>: How do you convey smell through a computer screen? How do you convey how good your weighted blanket feels? To solve this, consumer products will focus more on the emotion, less on the product features. For body wash, the brand doesn’t talk about how the sulfates will get you clean, how it smells, and the ounces of product you get. They talk about taking a moment for yourself.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Don’t worry about correct grammar</strong>. Go ahead and break grammar rules. The only thing that matters is that your customer takes action and you build trust in the process. I add that last part about building trust because you want to aim for conversion, but not destroy your brand equity in the process. It’s a delicate balance per the <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/brand-marketing-vs-performance-marketing" target="_blank">Brand vs Performance Marketing Spectrum</a>.</p><p><strong>Increase desire, don’t just decrease friction</strong>: People jump through hoops for things they want. Did you pick your spouse because they were the most convenient option? No, you picked them despite needing to overcome obstacles. We tend to focus on removing friction because it feels comfortable and there’s a checklist of ways to do it. There’s less of a formula for <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/increasing-desire-vs-decreasing-friction" target="_blank">increasing desire</a>--which makes it all the more worthwhile because there’s upside potential that fewer people attempt to tap into.</p><p><strong>Be/Have/Do</strong>: This is one of my favorite frameworks for showing transformation. You want to show how your product helps a brand transform. What does your product let your customer be that they weren’t before? What do customers have that they didn’t have before? What can they do now that they couldn’t do before? This is a good exercise to focus your value proposition and generate talking points for business development, sales, and marketing copy.</p><p><strong>Aim for “No brainer status”</strong>: You need to aim for an instant yes. Not a yes after a hundred hours of nurturing. Think about what features, benefits, and value would make this an instant yes for your prospective customers. By the way, even if you think it’s an instant yes, you’ll still need to work at getting the yes. <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/everything-takes-longer-than-you-think-so-plan-accordingly" target="_blank">Everything takes longer than you think</a>. The reason to aim for a no brainer status is because this is like a rubber band. We’re stretching it, but it will snap back a bit.</p><p><strong>Do what makes their eyes light up (ELU)</strong>: You should have your pitch ready, but <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/eyes-light-up-elu" target="_blank">watch out for what makes people’s eyes light up</a>. What makes them lean in? You can tell when someone doesn’t really care about what you’re saying. Then there are moments when suddenly a spark of aliveness flashes in their eyes because you just said something they care about. Watch for ELU.</p><p><strong>Avoid backstory scope creep</strong>: This applies to showing your value via email, pitches, or conversations. Remove the 90% of stuff that’s only moderately relevant, and be ruthlessly focused on the 10% that’s most relevant to your audience. Talking about your camping trip? <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/start-right-before-you-get-eaten-by-the-bear" target="_blank">Start right before you almost get eaten by a bear</a>. Not a detailed agenda of the days leading up to arriving at camp.</p><p><strong>Consider overhauling and starting from scratch</strong>: If you’re struggling to describe your value, figure out <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/how-to-fix-limbo-copywriting" target="_blank">if the problem is the marketing or the underlying idea</a>.</p><p><strong>Focus on what your customer wants to hear about, not what you want to talk about</strong>: This is an easy way to figure out what to trim from your talking points. You think, “I have so much to talk about. Where do I start??” Start by asking yourself what would change your audience’s behavior for the better. I call this principle <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/strategy-not-self-expression" target="_blank">Strategy, Not Self-Expression</a>.</p><p><strong>Choose the right heuristics and design to appeal to people like us</strong>: Upon landing on a site, most customers are judging you within a few seconds. “People like us” refers to whatever group you might identify with. For example, people like us could be thoughtful, design-conscious knowledge workers at tech startups.</p><p>What’s a product that instantly sold you? I’m curious and would love to know…</p></div></div></div>]]>

                    <p>One solution is to buy a decommissioned cargo ship, and then strand it on a very shallow part of the sea, on international waters. You need really deep pockets and an adventurous spirit to succeed with this, but what an exciting adventure it would be!</p>
                    
                    <h2>Finding a ship</h2>
                    <p>The ship has to be large enough to become a small island where you can live permanently, and sustain yourself through growing of food. It also has to be large enough to not get turned over in a storm. This leaves us with large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_tanker" target="_blank">oil tankers</a>. They are flat bottomed, and have several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_the_oil_tanker" target="_blank">compartments</a> for the cargo which will make them more stable in rough seas.</p>
                    <p>To know the price of decommissioned ships we can look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_breaking" target="_blank">ship breaking yards</a>. In <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@22.4365831,91.7317171,15z" target="_blank">Chittagong, Bangladesh</a>, there is one of the biggest ship grave yards in the world, where they run the ships full speed onto the shore, and the locals are busy cutting them up into pieces and selling it as scrap metal.</p>
                    <p><i>Below: The coastline of Chittagong is lined with ships.</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ChittagongShipGraveyard.jpg"></p>
                    <p><i>Below: Zooming in you can see how the ships are being cut to pieces.</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ChittagongShipGraveyard2.jpg"></p>
                    <p>The scrap metal companies buy a medium size ship for around <a href="http://www.jimbojack.com/Countries/Bangladesh/Bangladesh_Chittagong_Ship-breaking_Yards.htm" target="_blank">$10 million</a>. Add to that the cost of sailing the ship to its final destination.</p>
                    <p>What remains is to contact shipping companies, and add yourself to the wait list of one of their vessels.</p>
                    <h2>Destination</h2>
                    <p>The challenge is to find a part of the ocean that is very shallow, but on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea" target="_blank">international waters</a>, which is 22 km (12 nautical miles) from the shoreline. To be safe, it should also be out of each country's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_economic_zone" target="_blank">exclusive economic zone</a>, which is 370 km from the shoreline.</p>
                    <p><i>Below: Waters (light blue) outside of any country's exclusive economic zone (dark blue).</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ExclusiveEconomicZones.jpg"></p>
                    <p>If possible it should be in a climate that makes farming easy, in a part of the world not afflicted by piracy, and in relatively calm waters.</p>
                    <p>How shallow does the ocean have to be? The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(hull)" target="_blank">draft</a> of a reasonably large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panamax" target="_blank">Panamax</a> class tanker is 10 to 15 m.</p>
                    <p>To find the shallow parts of the oceans, we can use <a href="https://www.google.com/earth/" target="_blank">Google Earth</a>&nbsp;to visualize data about seamounts (mountains in the oceans) from <a href="http://www.seaaroundus.org/" target="_blank">SeaAroundUs.org</a>, and then match this with the EEZ areas, as a user has done at the <a href="http://www.seasteading.org/forum-list/topic/natural-breakwaters-avoiding-waves-geography/" target="_blank">Seasteading.org</a> web site.</p>
                    <p>I have saved the data files here for future reference: <a href="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ExclusiveEconomicZones.kmz">ExclusiveEconomicZones.kmz</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/SeamountsUnder100m.kmz">SeamountsUnder100m.kmz</a>.</p>

                    <p>The Vitoria-Trinidade site looks like the easiest and safest option, and also the least afflicted by storms.</p>
                    <p>The ship could possibly be sailed slowly into position, and then sunken to rest on the ocean floor, by initially filling the tanks with water, and then replacing it with rocks sourced from the bottom.</p>
                    <p>But this requires the ocean floor to be reasonably flat, which might prove difficult, so a more realistic approach would be to anchor the ship using several huge anchors and long chains, and then filling up the bottom of the ship with ballast to make the ship behave well in storms.</p>
                    <p>On top of the deck you fill up with soil and plant trees and have various types food production. A Panamax ship has a deck of around 280 x 30 m, which is 8,400 m2, or the size of a soccer field.</p>
                    <p>Fresh water is made by desalination of sea water. Solar panels provide electricity. For housing the existing bunks of the ship is used.</p>
                    <p>Some obvious considerations include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Protection from intruders.</li>
                        <li>Having sustainable food production.</li>
                        <li>Protection from storms and high waves.</li>
                        <li>Hull maintenance, to save it from deteriorating in the saline water.</li>
                        <li>Carefully examining the site to look for geological problems (under water volcanoes, active fractures, etc).</li>
                    </ul>

<p>The War on Drugs is a massive failure. As neuroscientist and Columbia University Professor Dr. Carl Hart writes in his latest book, <em>Drug Use for Grown-Ups: Chasing Liberty in the Land of Fear</em>, “the American taxpayer spends approximately $35 billion each year fighting this war, yet the drugs in question remain as plentiful, if not more so, than they were in 1981, when the sum total of America’s annual drug-control budget was a mere $1.5 billion.” The difference now, Hart describes, is that today, tens of thousands of people are dying from drug-related overdoses—with opioids being the “primary culprit.” But it’s not that simple, when the “opioid crisis” in particular is, in reality, “a crisis of data collection and reporting.” In this account, Hart digs below the surface to re-evaluate the American relationship to drugs, while shedding light on his own personal relationship to drugs, as well. Both captivating and controversial, we caught up with Dr. Hart to talk about drugs and parenting, policy, addiction, and more.&nbsp;</p>

What’s one thing you really want readers to glean from it?&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>CH: The thesis of the book is very simple: It’s about liberty so long as you don’t disrupt other people’s ability to pursue their liberty. I want people to understand that liberty and the pursuit of happiness are protected in our founding document. It’s the core of being American.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h-in-the-book-you-re-very-open-about-your-own-drug-use-what-s-that-like-coming-out-of-the-drug-closet-as-a-professional-and-as-a-parent"><span id="In_the_book_youre_very_open_about_your_own_drug_use_Whats_that_like_coming_out_of_the_drug_closet_as_a_professional_and_as_a_parent"><strong>In the book, you’re very open about your own drug use. What’s that like, coming out of the drug closet, as a professional and as a parent?</strong></span></h2>
<p>That’s a big question I have to face and I still struggle with it. The most important point for me is that I live like the man that I claim to be, and that means that I have to think about how my children see me. They know that I take care of my responsibilities with them and that I care about our broader community. They see people suffering, being vilified, and persecuted for being labeled a drug user—and they know their father is standing up on behalf of those people, who have been cast away in society, and they feel good about it. As long as they feel good, I feel good. My primary concern is my family, and my children in particular.&nbsp;</p>

I think before he thought I would remember, my dad would sometimes smoke “herb” in front of me before I was old enough to register the observation.

<p>My drug use is still personal and private. It’s like asking, “have your children seen you have sex?” I’m 54 years old, I’m not a child, and so I engage in grown-up behaviors in which my children will not observe me. I don’t observe them doing certain things, either. I only care about them being safe and taking care of themselves.</p>

At the same time, it’s a good opportunity to model a responsible, healthy relationship to drugs (be it heroin, cannabis, or even alcohol). How do you reconcile this with the query from those who might bring up the argument that trying drugs, like heroin, will automatically lead to addiction?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>There’s a lot in that question, so let’s unpack the first major point: How do you model responsible drug behavior? First of all, I don’t think of drug-taking behavior as abhorrent or unique. It’s just behavior. How do you model behavior? Well, what do responsible people do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>They keep their appointments, they make their obligations. And with drugs, you set aside time for that activity, and you know how long it takes for you to engage in that activity, and once it’s over, you carry out the other responsibilities you have. It’s not different from any other behavior—this is the big lie that’s so hard to undo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this notion that one hit and you’ll become addicted is nonsense: That point is always overstated. If a person is already irresponsible, then if they take heroin, they might also be irresponsible with their heroin use. How responsible a person is will tell how well they handle those other behaviors; it predicts how well they will do heroin or pay their bills. So their drug behavior, whether heroin or cannabis, is not unique from other behaviors.</p>

<p><strong><em>Read: <a href="https://doubleblindmag.com/end-the-war-on-drugs-psychedelics-drug-decriminalization/">Where Will Psychedelics and Other Drugs Be Decriminalized Next?</a></em></strong></p>

<h2 id="h-so-when-we-talk-about-drug-legalization-and-people-ask-what-about-the-addicts-what-do-you-say"><span id="So_when_we_talk_about_drug_legalization_and_people_ask-what_about_the_addicts-what_do_you_say">So when we talk about drug legalization and people ask—”what about the addicts?”—what do you say?</span></h2>

<p>In the U.S. and around the world, when we think about addiction, people tend to blame the drug—the substance, itself—for causing addiction, and that’s a limited and inaccurate approach. The majority of people who use any drug are not addicted: That tells you that you have to look beyond the drug with people who meet criteria for addiction. You’ll find that people who already have psychiatric disorders, or limited economic opportunities, are more likely to have the criteria for drug addiction. It’s not the drug that you have to focus on, but those other factors, regardless of whether they’re using the drug or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part of the problem with the drug discussion is that addition has hijacked the conversation, such that we only talk about drug addiction when talking about drug use. It’s like only talking about car crashes when we talk about automobiles. It’s ridiculous. So we have to change that, and that’s what I’m trying to do. If when we talk about drug use and we gave addiction proportional treatment of the topic, it wouldn’t be talked about that often. It’s a concern, but the reason people are addicted is not because of the drug.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>When we think about addiction, people tend to blame the drug—the substance, itself—for causing addiction, and that’s a limited and inaccurate approach. The majority of people who use any drug are not addicted: That tells you that you have to look beyond the drug.</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="h-so-if-the-majority-of-drug-users-are-not-problematic-drug-abusers-how-did-drug-use-and-abuse-get-conflated"><span id="So_if_the_majority_of_drug_users_are_not_problematic_drug_abusers_how_did_drug_use_and_abuse_get_conflated">So if the majority of drug users are not problematic drug “abusers,” how did drug use and abuse get conflated?</span></h2>
<p>When we think about the addiction narrative, the reason many of these substances are prohibited is American racism. One of the primary motivating factors behind alcohol prohibition was dislike of the Germans; remember this was around the time of World War I. When we think about cocaine, to vilify it, its negative effects were associated with Black people. When we wanted to vilify opioids, we paired it with the Chinese. All of this media hysteria was inaccurate—lies and misinformation. By connecting horrible acts with those groups and the drugs they used, the media reports and politicians gained standing. They oftentimes used white women as the object of their protections, so they were protecting white women and children from being corrupted with these drugs. Once they were corrupted, they would intermingle with those other racial groups—so they really tied the potential for addiction with these drugs, hoping to make people fearful of taking them in their quest to protect primarily white women. That’s how we have this connection.</p>

And how do we define drug abuse, versus drug use, to begin with?</span></h2>
<p>We define it as when people have certain symptoms in which they have disruptions in their functioning: They may not be meeting their occupational obligations, their family obligations, or other obligations. They may be actively trying to quit and having a hard time. They may experience some negative effects from their drug use, whether physiological or social, and they are disturbed by all these symptoms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They, themselves, must be disturbed by these symptoms. Such as, you may engage in behavior and your significant other may not like it, but you may not be troubled by the behavior or it may not actually be a problem. So the person, themself, must be distressed by these symptoms, too. The person’s own perspective is important.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our country, each of us are guaranteed life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We often think about those rights as guarantees in jingoistic terms, as opposed to unpacking how serious and noble those ideas are, and so I’m trying to remind people that everyone has those unalienable rights. That means they can’t be taken away from them, as long as they don’t disrupt other people’s ability to pursue their rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I had a relative who had a drug problem, I’d be hard pressed to find a place in the U.S. where I would send them—in large part because, too often, those places focus their energies on the drug itself, as opposed to those other psychosocial factors, such as whether that person has housing, health care, or gainful employment (that is, employment that would be appropriate for their age, education, ability to support a family, all those things). Does the person have other psychiatric illnesses or problems going on? All those factors are far more important than the drug itself. And too often the drug rehab centers focus on the drug itself and miss the boat.</p>

<p>For one, why are we missing the boat when we talk about opioids? We are getting it wrong because there is money in getting it wrong. There are grants now to deal with the so-called opioid crisis. This is an economic strategy, as opposed to making sure people have gainful employment. Police organizations get grants. NGOs get grants to deal with opioids. Coroners, medical examiners, everyone is getting money to deal with it. Everything they do, they see opioids because that’s where the spotlight is shining—if you’re looking for something, you’ll find it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-2fc7e2d4=""><p>We love <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. Individually, as an organization - we're just fans through and through.</p>
<p>As such we like to write with the Hacker News audience in mind.</p>
<p>In that regard we've met with a small - tiny, really (but very encouraging) - amount of success: The story of our form app has piqued the curiousity of some fellow bootstrappers as they follow us building and running a small SaaS business.</p>
<p>Here are our analytics numbers for each 3-month period this year  (2020) because for some reason GA restricts segment view windows to 93 days.</p>
<h2 id="january-4th---april-2nd">January 4th - April 2nd</h2>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/thirtyfive-thousand-01-01-2020-04-02-2020.png" alt="January 4th - April 2nd"></p>
<p>You can see our clear, breakaway winner here is our experience with the <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/our-experience-with-stripe-atlas">Stripe Atlas program</a>, a part blow-by-blow business accounting, part love letter to Stripe and this beautiful business-in-a-box tool it's made for small businesses like us. The other top pages are just runoff from the Stripe article, my poor <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/a-blog-in-five-functions">blog architecture</a> post barely scraping the top 10.</p>
<h2 id="april-3rd---july-4th">April 3rd - July 4th</h2>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/thirtyfive-thousand-04-03-2020-07-04-2020.png" alt="April 3rd - July 4th"></p>
<p>This period is a bit more mixed - Hacker News users love Tailwind (surprise!) and are interested in their <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/top-concerns-when-choosing-a-tech-stack-for-your-personal-website">personal stack</a> but otherwise the top pages are just a set of basic application workhorses indicating we're starting to get some more traction in everyday use.</p>
<h2 id="july-5th---october-5th">July 5th - October 5th</h2>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/thirtyfive-thousand-07-05-2020-10-05-2020.png" alt="July 5th - October 5th"></p>
<p>Once again our <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/how-an-email-got-us-five-thousand-aws-credits.png">latest experience with Stripe</a> proved a pretty interesting piece of content to the denizens of Hacker News, as enamored they are with Stripe, like all developers (including us!). This episode relies on the sending of a fateful email, but you can read through the whole thread for the full account.</p>
<h2 id="october-6th---december-31st">October 6th - December 31st</h2>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/thirtyfive-thousand-10-06-2020-12-31-2020.png" alt="October 6th - December 31st"></p>
<p><em>Whomp whomp</em>. You can see this period we did a fraction of our normal HN traffic, which happened because we made a big push to rollout our new file support system(!) (Check out the <a href="https://formcake.com/changelog">changelog</a> for other improvements) that pretty much sucked the life out of anything else (including new blog posts).</p>
<h2 id="the-full-view">The Full View</h2>
<p>So what does this year look like generally, outside of just HN users?</p>
<p>This is what the pageviews look like for all traffic:</p>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/thirtyfive-thousand-01-01-2020-12-31-2020-overview.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Admittedly, though it's interesting and I think useful in other ways to have information on application usage, let's segment it out in just this case to only show us the performance of <code>/blog</code> pages.</p>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/thirtyfive-thousand-01-01-2020-12-31-2020-overview-blog.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Our top three Stripe pieces account for the overwhelming amount of our traffic, at 84% of all unique pageviews.</p>
<p>Funny enough though, our next top contender, on the basis of strong organic traffic, is a simple, short-and-sweet technical article on a topic I found troublesome and surprisingly under-documented - <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/adding-a-single-page-to-hugo">adding a single page to a site powered by Hugo</a>, the static site generator.</p>
<h2 id="2021">2021</h2>
<p>Again, we <em>love</em> Hacker News. Getting anyone from HN to follow an accounting of our small business feels particularly validating.</p>
<p>We have big plans this year - for expanding the app, our online presence, and our internal processes. <a href="https://formcake.com/feed.xml">Subscribe to our RSS feed</a> or, sign-up to the email list below, or, you know, just check back sometime for more about it all!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>COVID-19 created circumstances where many businesses were forced to be flexible or shut down entirely. When no childcare or in-person school was available for workers during government-prompted shutdowns, most businesses knew better than to crack down harshly on parents who still had caregiving duties they couldn't avoid during the workday. Instead, many businesses created an unprecedented level of flexibility, allowing dual-income families, for instance, to shift what time of day or which days of the week when they completed their hours.</p><p>The strong recommendation that workers work from home when possible also changed how businesses viewed workplace flexibility. Rather than seeing work from home as a logistical barrier that they weren't willing to work around, they saw it as the best, most efficient way to keep workers safe while still creating value for the company.</p><p>Shorter work weeks have remained less common than the 5-day work week because of, among other things, distrust among leaders and worries about logistical hassle, despite strong research that many companies grow productivity and job satisfaction when they choose a four day work week. Here are some of the reasons why these hurdles were lowered by the experiences that businesses had in 2020.</p><h2 id="productivity-targets-covid-19-shutdowns-and-caregiving-responsibilities">Productivity Targets, COVID-19 Shutdowns, and Caregiving Responsibilities</h2><p>Not everyone thrived in the work-from-home, somewhat-more-flexible schedule of 2020, but many managers were impressed to discover that their team members were managing to efficiently allocate their work, get things done on time and up to standards, all while handling an impressive array of stressors in their personal lives or caregiving responsibilities for children. Companies who had previously assumed that giving team members greater autonomy and less time in the office total would tank productivity saw that they were wrong.</p><p>Even after schools are fully open and it becomes an expectation that team members will not have any caregiving duties during their work shifts, the lessons of this time period will linger with managers and other workplace leadership. The fact that having to get everything done in the time available was a powerful motivator is part of why research shows that workers with 4 day work weeks actually produce as much or more than their 5 day a week counterparts. When there are constraints on our time, we work smarter, not just harder, to get everything done.</p><h2 id="offering-flexibility-has-proven-its-track-record">Offering Flexibility Has Proven Its Track Record</h2><p>Some companies, realizing that the whole world was experiencing more health anxiety and isolation during COVID-19, made it their mission to remove barriers and make it easier for team members to get their work done. From making in-office work optional (to keep density of people working in the office low) to letting people log their hours any time as long as they got done each week, workplaces tried out unprecedented flexibility and got the chance to create a track record. Of course, managers had to modify their structures, figuring out how to do remote meetings well and making sure they knew if a team member was struggling, but in so many cases, the results were strong because team members were grateful for the flexibility. When we like a perk at work, we work hard to convince leadership to keep that perk. After COVID-19, workers everywhere will be able to point to their performance during a flexible work schedule and say, "see? I personally benefited and the company benefitted too."</p><h2 id="time-with-family-has-proven-valuable-to-many-workers">Time With Family Has Proven Valuable to Many Workers</h2><p>Shorter work weeks have also traditionally been rare partly because some workers say to themselves, "More time at home? What would I do with that?" Even very busy people have been so conditioned to assume that all day every day is for being at work. They couldn't imagine what a slower pace of life might look like.</p><p>Now, not everyone was happy to be at home with whoever they lived with during the pandemic. However, quite a lot of people came to the realization that spending time with roommates or family members slowed them down and reduced their stress. When workplaces were in a lull as the government made decisions about how to proceed, people noticed that they could focus on other things that mattered to them. Workers who previously didn't bat an eye at 50 or 60 hour work weeks may now see a shorter work week as a benefit they could enjoy and take advantage of in the futures.</p><p>As a result of this increased value for shorter work weeks, employers are more likely to see the logistical hurdles as worthwhile for the gains in employee retention and satisfaction.</p><h2 id="the-2020-experiment-prompts-further-experimentation">The 2020 Experiment Prompts Further Experimentation</h2><p>Not every company gave their teams flexibility specifically in the length of the workweek during 2020. Instead, they may have experimented with using more online tools, telecommuting for business meetings, or other strategies that created surprising savings while still allowing the job to get done. Companies whose 'new normal' includes some forms of workplace flexibility will have a harder time turning down other forms of experimentation going forward, especially with so much evidence that shorter work weeks are good for both the team members and the bottom line at the company.</p><p>Trying an experiment with shorter work weeks is likely to be met with enthusiasm among workers, especially when they are designed in a simple, elegant way that doesn't decrease customer experience or make life difficult for payroll or other parts of the company. When you handle issues of what to do when you have a question for someone on their day off and other small concerns, it's easier than you think to implement a pilot program and see what happens. Yes, there are companies that find that four day work weeks clash with their culture, but far more find that the motivation factor, the job satisfaction, and the resulting recruiting power are major benefits.</p><p>Whether 2021 brings more of the same challenges that 2020 brought or results in even more upheaval, companies that are willing to re-evaluate the status quo will be able to confront future challenges with better results.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>When doing image processing, rendering or converting between RGB color spaces, it is easy to end up with RGB values outside of the 0.0 to 1.0 range (or 0 to 255 for 8-bit colors). This normally means that it isn’t possible to encode the color and it needs to be adjusted somehow before being displayed or encoded (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ScRGB">scRGB</a> is an example of an exception, and has a different range). The range of supported colors in a color spaces is referred to as a its <em>gamut</em>.</p><p>Many of the colors outside the gamut are still valid colors, they just can’t be encoded in the given color space. The colors that can’t be encoded can be categorized as follows (for RGB color spaces without <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_color#Imaginary_colors">imaginary primaries</a>):</p><ul><li><strong>One or more RGB values are larger than one, but none are negative</strong><br>These colors are too bright for the color space, but could be encoded at a lower luminance.</li><li><strong>One or more negative values</strong><br>These color are more colorful than the color space is able to encode. Some of these can be real colors, but they can also be colors more colorful than physically possible. This is a consequence of linear encoding of colors, which is able to encode colors that can’t exist in real life.</li></ul><p>The simplest technique for dealing with colors outside the valid range is to simply clamp <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">R</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">G</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> individually. The simplicity of this makes the technique widespread, but unfortunately it has significant drawbacks and can lead to unpleasant color distortions.</p><p>Here is an example of taking a photo and increasing its exposure and colorfulness significantly, with results displayed as sRGB. Colorfulness has been increased by scaling <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/">Oklab</a> chroma. RGB values here are simply clamped to the 0.0 to 1.0 range.</p><br><div><p><a href="https://bottosson.github.io/img/gamutclipping/flowers/original.jpg"><img alt="Original" decoding="async" height="378" loading="lazy" src="https://bottosson.github.io/img/gamutclipping/flowers/original.jpg" width="504"></a><em>Unprocessed</em></p><p><a href="https://bottosson.github.io/img/gamutclipping/flowers/clipped_rgb.jpg"><img alt="Processed" decoding="async" height="378" loading="lazy" src="https://bottosson.github.io/img/gamutclipping/flowers/clipped_rgb.jpg" width="504"></a><em>Processed with out of range values clamped</em></p></div><p>This is of course problematic. Hues are heavily distorted and all the details in the flowers are gone. Better methods are needed. Thankfully, this problem isn’t new and has been researched a lot over the years.</p><p>Two main research topics exist:</p><blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_mapping">Tone mapping</a></strong>, which is concerned with mapping high dynamic range images to a lower dynamic range. This typically involves altering both colors inside and outside the gamut and sometimes involves different kinds of spatial filtering to keep details while reducing overall dynamic range.</p><p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_management#Gamut_mapping">Gamut mapping</a></strong>, which is concerned with mapping colors from one color space to another and dealing with the mismatch in what colors can be encoded. This can either be done using <em>gamut compression</em> or <em>gamut expansion</em>, which adjusts all colors of an image, or using <em>gamut clipping</em>, which leaves colors that exist in both color spaces intact, while mapping colors outside the gamut back in range. For an overview see the paper <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236121201_The_Fundamentals_of_Gamut_Mapping_A_Survey">“The Fundamentals of Gamut Mapping: A Survey”</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Tone mapping, gamut expansion and gamut compression are all useful techniques, but will not be the focus of this article. Instead we will limit the scope to creating a practical alternative to clipping sRGB values, by looking at gamut clipping in the sRGB color space and on relatively simple, robust and portable algorithms. The source code for the operations shown is also available, at the <a href="#source-code">end of the article</a>.</p><p>The techniques investigated are also, with some additional work, applicable to other color spaces, and some of the building blocks can be for other things, such as gamut compression. Combining gamut clipping with tone mapping can also be useful since some tone mapping techniques may still produce colors outside the target gamut.</p><h2 id="gamut-clipping">Gamut Clipping <a href="#gamut-clipping"><span><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" enable-background="new 0 0 512 512" version="1.1" xml:space="preserve" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M459.654,233.373l-90.531,90.5c-49.969,50-131.031,50-181,0c-7.875-7.844-14.031-16.688-19.438-25.813  l42.063-42.063c2-2.016,4.469-3.172,6.828-4.531c2.906,9.938,7.984,19.344,15.797,27.156c24.953,24.969,65.563,24.938,90.5,0  l90.5-90.5c24.969-24.969,24.969-65.563,0-90.516c-24.938-24.953-65.531-24.953-90.5,0l-32.188,32.219  c-26.109-10.172-54.25-12.906-81.641-8.891l68.578-68.578c50-49.984,131.031-49.984,181.031,0  C509.623,102.342,509.623,183.389,459.654,233.373z M220.326,382.186l-32.203,32.219c-24.953,24.938-65.563,24.938-90.516,0  c-24.953-24.969-24.953-65.563,0-90.531l90.516-90.5c24.969-24.969,65.547-24.969,90.5,0c7.797,7.797,12.875,17.203,15.813,27.125  c2.375-1.375,4.813-2.5,6.813-4.5l42.063-42.047c-5.375-9.156-11.563-17.969-19.438-25.828c-49.969-49.984-131.031-49.984-181.016,0  l-90.5,90.5c-49.984,50-49.984,131.031,0,181.031c49.984,49.969,131.031,49.969,181.016,0l68.594-68.594  C274.561,395.092,246.42,392.342,220.326,382.186z"></path></svg><span></span></span></a></h2><p>The goal of gamut clipping is to take colors that are outside the target gamut, and map them back to valid colors in a way that avoids perceived distortion and artifacts.

	<p>Garbage collectors (GCs) feel like some sort of esoteric programming magic.  What’s really funny is
that a simple good-enough garbage collector is actually quite easy to write.  The core functionality
of a basic tri-color GC is only around 250 lines of C code.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The only real hard part about writing a GC is to build the confidence that – yes – <em>you</em> are
capable of writing one!  Really: this isn’t black magic.  If you can write C code, and you
understand pointers and basic bit manipulation, then you’re perfectly capable of understanding and
writing GCs.</p>

<p>I researched a couple different GC algorithms, and settled on a basic tri-color mark-sweep for this
experiment.  I insisted that the GC be incremental so that I could use it in game engines if I
wanted – I didn’t want to have long pauses while the GC was running, which would affect frame rate.</p>

<h2 id="allocation">Allocation</h2>

<p>You would think Garbage Collectors are about collecting garbage.  That’s only half of the equation
though.  The GC begins at <em>allocation</em>.</p>

<p>When you design a garbage collector, you are first designing an allocater.</p>

<h3 id="tables">Tables</h3>

<p>Allocation is pretty simple: I preallocate a large table of each type.  For example, I have a string
table, a list table, a hash table, etc.</p>

<div>

		<p><img src="https://sean.cm/i/tricolor-garbage-collector/hash-table.png" alt="Basic Hash Table" onload="javascript: this.width /= 2; this.onload = null;"></p><p>
	
		Basic Hash Table
	
	</p>
</div>

<p>For the hash table, each slot in the table contains a <code>size</code>, a pointer to the list of <code>keys</code>, and a
pointer to the list of <code>values</code>.  The pointers are <code>NULL</code> when the slot is unallocated.</p>

<h3 id="bitmaps">Bitmaps</h3>

<p>Next, I use a <em>bitmap</em> to track whether a slot is allocated or not.</p>

<p>Basically a bitmap is a list of 64-bit unsigned integers.  That means for each integer in the
bitmap, I can track 64 slots in my table.  For this reason, I preallocate the tables in multiples
of 64 slots, so that every bit in the bitmap is used.</p>

<div>

		<p><img src="https://sean.cm/i/tricolor-garbage-collector/hash-table2.png" alt="Allocation Bitmap" onload="javascript: this.width /= 2; this.onload = null;"></p><p>
	
		Allocation Bitmap
	
	</p>
</div>

<p>If a bit is <code>1</code>, then the corresponding slot is allocated – otherwise, the slot is free to use.</p>

<h3 id="allocation-algorithm">Allocation Algorithm</h3>

<p>At this point, it’s pretty obvious how allocation would work: if we need a new hash, then scan the
allocation bitmap for a <code>0</code>.  The first <code>0</code> we find will give us the slot to use.</p>

<p>Then, set the bit to <code>1</code> to indicate that the slot is now allocated, and return the slot.</p>

<p>The only trick here is to scan the allocation bitmap quickly: we can check 64 slots at a time by
just seeing if the allocation integer is <code>0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFLL</code> (64-bit unsigned int with all bits
set).</p>

<p>Once we find a non-full integer, then find the first bit inside the integer that is a <code>0</code>.  Turns
out the C function <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/ffs.3.html"><code>ffsll</code></a> finds the first <code>1</code>
pretty damn quickly, so we just need to bit-not (<code>~</code>), and search for <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>(<code>ffsll</code> also starts counting at 1, but we want to start counting at 0, so we subtract 1)</p>

<p>Here’s the allocation code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int64_t</span> <span>bmp_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>uint64_t</span> <span>*</span><span>bmp</span><span>,</span> <span>int64_t</span> <span>slots</span><span>){</span>
  <span>// search for the first 0 bit, set it to 1,</span>
  <span>// then return the slot</span>
  <span>// return -1 if nothing found</span>
  <span>slots</span> <span>/=</span> <span>64</span><span>;</span> <span>// checking 64 slots at a time</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int64_t</span> <span>loop</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>loop</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>slots</span><span>;</span> <span>loop</span><span>++</span><span>){</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>bmp</span> <span>==</span> <span>0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFLL</span><span>){</span>
      <span>// this area is full, go to the next area</span>
      <span>bmp</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
      <span>continue</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>// we're guaranteed at least one bit is 0</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>ffsll</span><span>(</span><span>~*</span><span>bmp</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>*</span><span>bmp</span> <span>|=</span> <span>1LL</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>pos</span><span>;</span> <span>// set the bit at pos</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>loop</span> <span>*</span> <span>64</span> <span>+</span> <span>pos</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hopefully that isn’t too scary for you.  It’s just what I’ve described.</p>

<p>The only thing left is when <code>bmp_alloc</code> returns <code>-1</code>, that means our table is completely full, so we
need to grow our table and bitmap.  That’s just a matter of <code>realloc</code> and <code>memset</code>.</p>

<p>And that’s it for allocation!  See, writing your own allocater isn’t that hard :-).</p>

<h2 id="marksweep">Mark/Sweep</h2>

<p>Now we get to the core algorithm.</p>

<p>Mark/sweep is dead simple – our goal is to traverse all the values to see what is reachable from
the machine.  After we’re done traversing, whatever is allocated <em>but unreachable</em> needs to be
deallocated.</p>

<p>So if you think about it, this is what we need:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A way to mark that we’ve visited a value</li>
  <li>A way to crack open a value and visit everything inside</li>
  <li>A starting point</li>
</ol>

<p>The basic algorithm will be:</p>

<h4 id="phase-1-start">Phase 1: Start</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Clear the mark on all values, everywhere</li>
  <li>Create a list of values that need to be processed (the “pending” list)</li>
  <li>Add the starting values to the pending list, marking them</li>
  <li>Go to phase 2</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="phase-2-mark">Phase 2: Mark</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Pull a value off the pending list</li>
  <li>Crack it open and traverse all the values inside of it</li>
  <li>For each child value, if it is already marked, ignore it; if it isn’t marked, mark it, and add
it to the pending list</li>
  <li>Keep pulling values off the pending list and processing them until the list is empty – then go
to phase 3</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="phase-3-sweep">Phase 3: Sweep</h4>

<ol>
  <li>For every allocated value, check to see if it’s marked</li>
  <li>If a value isn’t marked, then free any memory associated with the object, and clear the
allocation bit of its slot, so it can be reused</li>
  <li>Go back to phase 1</li>
</ol>

<p>Make sure this makes sense!</p>

<p>The final code won’t look exactly like this, but this is the essence of the algorithm.  Convince
yourself that this algorithm <em>works</em>.</p>

<p>It’s important to truly and deeply understand this core algorithm, because later we’re going to have
to figure out how to make this incremental without screwing it up.</p>

<h2 id="referenced-bitmap">Referenced Bitmap</h2>

<p>So, it looks like we’ll need a way to mark each value.  Let’s use another bitmap.</p>

<p>For each table, in addition to the allocation bitmap, we’ll have a referenced bitmap.  The
referenced bitmap will have a <code>1</code> if the value is marked, indicating that it is reachable from the
starting point.</p>

<div>

		<p><img src="https://sean.cm/i/tricolor-garbage-collector/hash-table3.png" alt="Referenced Bitmap" onload="javascript: this.width /= 2; this.onload = null;"></p><p>
	
		Referenced Bitmap
	
	</p>
</div>

<p>This might seem a bit weird to use these bitmaps – why not just put an allocation bool and a
referenced bool inside of each slot in the table?</p>

<p>Speed, of course.</p>

<p>Remember that our allocation algorithm could check 64 slots at a time – it didn’t have to run down
each slot and look at each individual bool.  We’ll see more bit tricks that will speed up
deallocation later.</p>

<h2 id="starting-point">Starting Point</h2>

<p>Where do you start?  That depends on your VM.</p>

<p>This experimental VM is a register based machine.  That means I have instructions like
<code>R3 = StrCat R2, R0</code>, which says “create a new string by concatenating the strings in register 2 and
register 0, and store the result in register 3”.</p>

<p>The key insight is that the registers alone work as a starting point.</p>

<p>Why is that?</p>

<p>The only way to reach an object is if the object is in one of the registers, <em>or</em> if you can
traverse to the object using what’s already in the registers.</p>

<p>So, if we use the registers as our starting point, our Mark phase will do the same traversal as
<em>any possible instruction sequence</em>, which guarantees that we won’t accidentally deallocate
something our VM could use.</p>

<h2 id="adding-to-the-pending-list">Adding to the Pending List</h2>

<p>One more thing…</p>

<p>We’ll be adding a lot of things to the pending list, in a lot of different scenarios, so it’s best
to think about solving the general case.</p>

<p>Suppose you are simply given a list of values.  How would you determine if they should be added to
the pending list?</p>

<p>The value’s type must be checked, and categorized into three basic buckets:</p>

<h3 id="non-allocated-values">Non-allocated Values</h3>

<p>If the value is <code>void</code>, <code>null</code>, boolean, or a number, then it’s skipped entirely: the GC doesn’t
operate on these values, because they aren’t allocated in the first place.</p>

<h3 id="allocated-but-non-traversable">Allocated but Non-traversable</h3>

<p>If the value can’t be traversed, then it’s marked, but it isn’t put on the pending list.  Why put
something on the pending list if it doesn’t have any child values?  Think of a string: yes, it’s
allocated, but you can’t crack it open and find more values inside of it.</p>

<h3 id="allocated-and-traversable">Allocated and Traversable</h3>

<p>Lastly, we have values that are allocated and can be traversed – these are things like lists and
hashes.</p>

<p>If the value is already marked, then we ignore it.  That’s because if it’s marked, that means it’s
already been processed, so we don’t want to process it all over again.</p>

<p>Otherwise, <em>finally</em>, at this point, we mark the value, and add it to the pending list.  This is the
only situation where a value is added to the pending list.</p>

<h3 id="code">Code</h3>

<p>Here is a basic implementation.  I call the function <code>gc_add_gray</code> because in traditional GC
terminology, adding something to the pending list is “coloring it gray”. Silly, I know, but we’re
stuck with it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>gc_add_gray</span><span>(</span><span>uint32_t</span> <span>size</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span> <span>*</span><span>vals</span><span>){</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="phase-1-start-1">Phase 1: Start</h2>

<p>Now, it should be obvious how to implement Phase 1.</p>

<p>Clearing the mark for all values is easy, just <code>memset</code> the entire referenced bitmap to <code>0</code> for each
table.</p>

<p>Creating the pending list is easy… something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>pending_list_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>int</span> <span>pending_list_total</span> <span>=</span> <span>256</span><span>;</span>
<span>value</span> <span>*</span><span>pending_list</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>pending_list_total</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is your basic variable length list implementation in C.  Nothing new here.</p>

<p>(In practice, the pending list is only created once, and we just empty it here by setting
<code>pending_list_size</code> to <code>0</code>)</p>

<p>Adding the registers is cake too!</p>

<p>Something like: <code>gc_add_gray(registers_size, registers);</code></p>

<h2 id="phase-2-mark-1">Phase 2: Mark</h2>

<p>This is now pretty simple because we’re guaranteed only traversable values end up on the pending</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p>In the hours following a massive data leak where data from <a href="https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/brazils-health-ministrys-website-data-leak-exposed-243-million-medical-records-for-more-than-6-months/">almost all Brazilians</a> was exposed, users of the only industry where kind of mass security failure routinely happens concluded there was no way to prevent such breaches from taking place. “This is literally hundreds of millions of people, but sometimes these things happen and there’s nothing anyone can do to stop them”, said Bark Megor, echoing sentiments expressed by millions of individuals who post their names, religion, sexuality and personal information into centralized computer networks in order to send cat memes to one another. “And besides,” he continued, “this only happened because some employee uploaded a spreadsheet with usernames, passwords and access keys <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/personal-data-of-16-million-brazilian-covid-19-patients-exposed-online/">into a GitHub repository</a>. Mistakes do happen, after all.”</p>
<p>The incident follows a long string of similar incidents. Some are due to sophisticated hacking, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches#Late_2014_breach">the Yahoo breaches in 2013 and 2014 of all 3 billion accounts on the site</a>, including names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords, and in some cases, personal security questions and answers. Others are due to mere incompetence of a subcontractor, as the <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/virtualization-and-cloud/data-on-123-million-us-households-exposed-due-to-misconfigured-aws-s3-bucket">2017 Equifax leak of nearly all US households</a> or in the <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-vast-breach-likud-campaign-leaks-id-phones-addresses-of-all-israeli-adults/">2020 leak in the Likud Party of names, ID, phones, addresses of all Israeli adults</a>. “You’d think every person in the world would have their name, address and personal information out there by now,” said Larissa Layer, “pretty soon we will reach herd immunity to doxxing so maybe it doesn’t matter so much?”</p>
<p>“It’s a shame, but what can we do?” asks Wenin Denig, quizically raising his eyebrow. “It’s not like we have some kind of  <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2130877/the-biggest-data-breaches-of-the-21st-century.html"><strong>alternative open source platform that lets each person and organization control their own data</strong></a>. ” When asked about WordPress, <a href="https://kinsta.com/wordpress-market-share/#:~:text=WordPress'%20market%20share%20is%2039,one%2Dthird%20of%20the%20web!">which powers 4 in 10 websites in the world</a>, he exclaimed, “Are you kidding? I want videoconferencing, chats, events, payments, profiles, and I want it all in real time with slick notifications. If I am going to check my phone 10 times a day, and share the latest controversy with my friends it’s definitely not going to be on that old software. That’s the modern internet industry. But they better beware, if WhatsApp wants to sell my data, I’ll show them!” At press time, millions of people around the world were seen switching from WhatsApp to Telegram and Signal, in an effort to escape putting all their data, conversations, money and votes in one place.</p>

<p>One of the interesting Amateur cubesats in yesterday’s <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-launches-143-satellites-transporter-1-rocket-landing">SpaceX Transporter-1 launch</a> from Cape Canaveral is <a href="https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/ideassat.htm">IDEASSat</a>, a 3U cubesat from the <a href="https://www.ncu.edu.tw/en">National Central University of the Republic of China</a> (Taiwan) designed to study ionospheric plasma. <a href="https://twitter.com/pe0sat">Jan van Gils PE0SAT</a> drew my attention to this satellite as he was <a href="https://twitter.com/pe0sat/status/1353418234679103489">trying to see</a> if it was possible to decode it with any of the decoders existing in <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/gr-satellites">gr-satellites</a>. <a href="https://www.dk3wn.info/wp/">Mike Rupprecht DK3WN</a> also helped with a good recording, much cleaner than the SatNOGS recording that Jan was using.</p>



<p>Presumably this satellite uses “AX25, 9k6, GMSK”, as listed at the bottom of this page from <a href="https://www.nspo.narl.org.tw/inprogress.php?c=20030402&amp;ln=en">Taiwan’s National Space Organization</a>, and also in <a href="https://irsl.ss.ncu.edu.tw/media/paper/2020281.pdf">this research paper</a>. However, this is not true. It’s simple to check that the usual 9k6 FSK AX.25 decoders aren’t able to decode this signal, and a look at the FSK symbols shows that there is no scrambler (9k6 AX.25 uses the G3RUH scrambler) and that the symbol sequence doesn’t have much to do with AX.25.</p>



<p>After some reverse-enginnering, yesterday I figured out how the coding used by IDEASSat worked, and today I <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/gr-satellites/commit/17be909a338f0a8fe4b9931cc672d7453cff2d52">added a decoder to gr-satellites</a> to help Mike investigate what kind of telemetry the packets contain. The protocol is not very good, so I think it’s interesting to document it in detail, as some sort of lessons learned. In this post I’ll do so. As it turns out, the protocol has some elements that loosely resemble AX.25, so I’m left wondering whether this is some unsuccessful attempt at implementing standard AX.25 (we’ve already seen very weird attempts, <a href="https://destevez.net/2018/12/decoding-eseo/">such as ESEO</a>).</p>



<p>An excerpt of the recording that Mike sent me can be found as <code><a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/satellite-recordings/blob/master/ideassat.wav">ideassat.wav</a></code> in my <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/satellite-recordings">satellite-recordings repo</a>. From the recording, which is already FM-demodulated, it is clear that the modulation is 9k6 FSK.</p>



<p>The first thing that shocked me when looking at Mike’s recording is that there doesn’t seem to be any preamble. The packet starts directly with the data, as shown here. This is very bad, because closed-loop clock recovery algorithms need a preamble to lock to the symbol clock.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_no_preamble.png"><img src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_no_preamble-644x78.png" alt="" width="610" height="73" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_no_preamble-644x78.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_no_preamble-300x36.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_no_preamble-768x93.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_no_preamble.png 1499w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px"></a><figcaption>Beginning of an IDEASSat burst</figcaption></figure>



<p>There is another bad thing about the FSK burst. If we look at the full burst, we see that before and after the burst there is a part that starts negative and slowly decays exponentially to zero.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_full.png"><img width="644" height="77" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_full-644x77.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_full-644x77.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_full-300x36.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_full-768x92.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_full.png 1501w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a><figcaption>Full IDEASSat burst</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is caused by the fact that the FSK low tone is held for some 100ms before and after the FSK burst. Doing this at the beginning of the burst is a bad idea. Most FSK demodulators are AC coupled. Even the digital ones, as they use this to correct for frequency errors. So if one of the FSK tones is held for a significant amount of time, AC coupling will drive this tone to zero (just as we see with Mike’s recording). Thus, when the FSK burst starts, it will do so with a large DC offset, as we can see in the first figure.</p>



<p>In any case, all these problems can be sorted out (at least for manual inspection) by using a DC block in <a href="https://www.gnuradio.org/">GNU Radio</a> to correct for the DC offset at the beginning of the burst and <a href="http://www.ossmann.com/mike/">Mike Ossman’s</a> <a href="https://github.com/mossmann/clock-recovery">whole packet clock recovery script</a> to extract all the symbols in the burst regardless of the lack of preamble.</p>



<p>After looking at the symbols for a while with <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, I realized that they were NRZ-I encoded UART-like data. By NRZ-I I mean the usual differential encoding from AX.25, where a 0 is encoded as a symbol change and a 1 is encoded as no symbol change. I say UART-like because it is exactly like 8-bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter#Data_framing">UART</a> with one stop bit and no parity (1N8 for short) except for the fact that bytes are transmitted most-significant-bit first, whereas most UART transmit bytes in least-significant-bit first ordering.</p>



<p>The clues that lead me to this conclusion are the following:</p>



<ul><li>Differential decoding yields a richer autocorrelation than if we don’t do differential decoding; it’s always handy to see how differential decoding changes the autocorrelation</li><li>After differential decoding, the autocorrelation showed peaks every 10 bits, and much larger peaks every 400 bits (which I’ll explain later)</li><li>Arranging the symbols in 10 bit segments, there were two adjacent bits that had constant and opposite values; these strongly suggest the stop and start bits of UART</li><li>The fact that the start bit of UART must be zero and the stop bit must be one indicates NRZ-I rather than plain differential decoding (the two are related by a bitwise inversion)</li><li>When interpreting the UART bytes as most-significant-bit first, I got ASCII data</li></ul>



<p>When decoded as NRZ-I 1N8 MSB UART, I got the following data in hex. The line breaks are mine for clarity and I’ve corrected a few obvious bit errors at the beginning by hand.</p>

<p>We see that the burst consists of 18 frames which are delimited by <code>0x7e</code> at the beginning and end. These resemble the HDLC flags. However, there aren’t any other aspects of HDLC such as bit stuffing or the CRC-16. In fact, there doesn’t seem to be any CRC that can be used to discard frames with bit errors. Frames have 40 bytes, and begin in the same way, which explains the strong autocorrelation at lags of 400 bits and multiples (recall that with 1N8 UART we have 10 bits per byte).</p>



<p>Now, the beginning of the frames is ASCII for</p>



<pre>BN0CU 0BN0IDA0</pre>



<p>These are almost like the AX.25 destination and source addresses (with a SSID of 0) that occur at the beginning of the AX.25 header. However, in <a href="http://www.ax25.net/AX25.2.2-Jul%2098-2.pdf">standard AX.25</a> these should be written in the 7 MSBs of each byte (so they don’t look like ASCII text), whereas in IDEASSat these are written in the 7 LSBs of each byte. I’ve encountered this misunderstanding about AX.25 address fields in other occasions.</p>



<p>After the two “addresses”, we have the byte <code>f0</code>, which probably is the PID field with the <em>No Layer 3 protocol</em> value. However, the control field byte, which in standard AX.25 is placed between the addresses and the PID, would be missing.</p>



<p>After the “PID field” we have 23 bytes of what seems to be telemetry. We don’t have a description for the telemetry format. However, it seems that the first of these 23 bytes is a counter that counts from 0 to 8 and iterates through 9 different telemetry structures. Most of the telemetry values seem simple 8-bit signed channels, and structure number 5 contains the ASCII string <code>B0BMFUN</code>. In this example burst, each of the two repetitions of each telemetry structure contains the same values. Probably this is always the case to increase the reliability.</p>



<p>So how does the IDEASSat gr-satellites <a href="https://gr-satellites.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components.html#deframers">deframer</a> work? Well, first off, I don’t think that the protocol used by IDEASSat is very good for transmitting data over RF. In fact it is not robust at all, and bit errors will cause all sorts of problems. </p>



<p>Besides the problem of the lack of preamble, using UART over RF is never a good idea. The state machine that tracks start and stop bits is prone to fall into all sorts of traps because of bit errors (unless a very complicate state machine is used). Incidentally, using UART, with or without NRZ-I, guarantees a bit transition every 10 bits, so at least this is good for clock recovery.</p>



<p>The use of <code>0x7e</code> to delimit frames can create a problem if that byte appears in the data (or even if it appears as a cause of bit errors). Finally, there is no means to check if decoded packets are corrupt.</p>



<p>I’m sure that with effort it would be possible to create a somewhat smart decoder for this protocol. Whole packet clock recovery could be used to prevent the problems caused by the lack of preamble. After NRZ-I decoding, the bits could be correlated against the expected UART start and stop bits for robust byte synchronization. If we use the fact that frames are 40 bytes long, then frame synchronization can also be made robust by finding several <code>0x7e</code> bytes (maybe correlating against the 36 <code>0x7e</code> bytes that we know should appear in an 18 frame burst). And finally the bit errors in the UART start and stop bits could be used as a heuristic of how many bit errors there were in the useful data, as a means to discard garbage frames. However, I don’t think it’s worth the effort. In the end, this protocol doesn’t have any FEC, and it is something ad-hoc used by just one satellite.</p>



<p>Therefore, today I decided to write a much simpler deframer for gr-satellites, with the goal of not investing much effort and having quickly something ready that Mike could use to start decoding frames.</p>



<p>The decoder in gr-satellites uses the standard <a href="https://gr-satellites.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components.html#fsk-demodulator">FSK demodulator</a>, which does closed-loop clock recovery with the <a href="https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Symbol_Sync">Symbol sync block</a>. The FSK symbols are NRZ-I decoded and then the sequence <code>00111111010011…</code></p></div></article></div>

    <p><a href="https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/scnow/name/brad-cox-obituary?pid=197454225">Dr. Brad J. Cox Ph.D. 1944 - 2021</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Brad Cox, Ph.D of Manassas, Virginia, died on January 2, 2021 at his residence. Dr. Cox was a computer scientist known mostly for creating the Objective – C programming language with his business partner, Tom Love, and for his work in software engineering (specifically software reuse) and software componentry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had always struggled building apps for the Mac, first in Classic MacOS and then in Mac OS X. I used Java, I used REALbasic, and I even had a professional license for Metrowerk's CodeWarrior so I could write apps in C or C++. But there was always some sort of mental block, or maybe the way my brain worked never really lined up with the way these programming languages did. Out of these I was most efficient with Java, but the UI toolkit was pretty lacking.</p>
<p>Then I saw these cool apps coming out for Mac OS X, and they were proudly written in Objective-C.</p>
<p>I took a couple of runs at it.  The brackets and pointers threw me off, but I kept on trying because I knew I needed to learn this language to build the apps I wanted to see in this world.</p>
<p>And then one day, I believe when plugging away on my little internet search utility <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030204023115/http://www.flyingmeat.com/vnk/">VoodooNetKey</a>, everything clicked.</p>
<p>Pointers, the brackets, selectors, messages. Oh my god, I get it now — the brackets! It's not a function call, it's something way better!</p>
<p>Everything just sort of aligned in my brain. Previously I found myself struggling to express the ideas I had in my head, and it was a frustrating experience. Now I was struggling to type fast enough and come up with new ideas that I could express in Objective-C. I felt like I could do anything I wanted with it.</p>
<p>And loadable bundles, and input managers- I can't express to you about how much fun it was being able to inject my Objective-C code into Safari or other applications to add functionality at runtime. Or using class-dump against the system frameworks to explore private methods. NSObject's <code>performSelector:</code> was just so great when you needed to quickly hack around something.</p>
<p>Objective-C was brilliant, powerful, and elegant.</p>
<p>All my applications are written in Objective-C even to this day. I play around in other languages from time to time, but I haven't found one that fits me like Objective-C does.</p>
<p>I realize it's not for everyone, and that Objective-C requires discipline, but it's been amazing for me. I owe my career in part to Brad Cox's creation, and I am forever grateful for it.</p>

<p>The following draft is concerned with the curious use of the nickname 'Cousin Jack' for the Cornish in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The 'Great Emigration' of the Cornish between around 1815 and the First World War saw what has been termed the 'wholescale scattering' of the Cornish to the new mining frontiers of North and South America, Australia and South Africa. From at least the mid-nineteenth century, these emigrants were known as 'Cousin Jacks', but the origin of this term seems rather obscure. The aim of the following note is to investigate the evidence for the early usage of the term 'Cousin Jack' and make some suggestions as to its origins in light of this evidence.&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qQtckgdORQ0/YAmWCnM8nfI/AAAAAAADP2I/SjbyinJIJ6QT1a5SiULZKMsl4eStLMsowCLcBGAsYHQ/s952/cousin-jack-cover-pryor.jpg"><img data-original-height="952" data-original-width="806" height="500" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qQtckgdORQ0/YAmWCnM8nfI/AAAAAAADP2I/SjbyinJIJ6QT1a5SiULZKMsl4eStLMsowCLcBGAsYHQ/w339-h400/cousin-jack-cover-pryor.jpg" width="424"></a></td></tr><tr><td>The cover of Oswald Pryor's <i>Cousin Jack Cartoons</i>&nbsp;(Sydney, 1945); Pryor was the son of Cornish parents and born at Moonta, South Australia. The books says the following of the front cover image: 'The cover design suggests a miner who has knocked off early, and has come up a ladderway remote from the main shaft in order to avoid running into the boss. Unfortunately he has run into the trouble he meant to avoid. This situation will be, obvious to all who know the Moonta scene. —The miner's hat here depicted is made of hard compressed pulp and colored a deep maroon when new. The candle is stuck on the front of the hat with a lump of wet red clay. This was the practice of old Cornish miners for generations.' (Image: <a href="http://search.slv.vic.gov.au/primo-explore/fulldisplay?vid=MAIN&amp;docid=SLV_VOYAGER951330&amp;context=L">State Library of Victoria</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The 'Great Emigration' of the Cornish in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries seems to have occurred on a quite remarkable scale. Margaret James-Korany has, for example, identified 42,000 individual emigrants sailing from the principal ports of Cornwall for Canada between 1831 and 1860, with some 6,200 leaving from Padstow alone in that period, and this outflow continued long after 1860 too. Thus the&nbsp;<i>Cornish Telegraph</i>&nbsp;for 5 September 1866 published a piece regretting 'the rage for emigration' in recent years, noting that 'the rush for Australia and America has been very great', and recent calculations suggest that at least 240,000 Cornish went overseas between 1860 and 1900, with a similar number leaving for England and Wales, with the result that Cornwall lost around a third of its population across the period. This depopulation was particularly marked amongst the youngest age-groups. Philip Payton observes that 44.8% of the Cornish male population aged fifteen to twenty-four left for overseas between 1861 and 1900, along with 26.2% of the female population in the same age group, and another 30% and 35.5% respectively left for other counties within Britain as well.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn1">1</a>)</p><p>The use of the term 'Cousin Jack' for the Cornish, particularly miners and especially emigrant miners, along with its companion-term 'Cousin Jenny', is well-evidenced from the second half of the nineteenth century onwards. John H. Forster's account of 'Life in the copper mines of Lake Superior', given to the Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society in 1887, contains the following illustrative passage:</p><blockquote><p>The Cornishman, or "<b><u>cousin Jack</u></b>," is a native of the duchy of Cornwall, England... The Cornishman of the present day, like his father, is of a roving disposition. His footsteps may be traced around the globe. There is no prominent mining field in the world wherein you will not find "<b><u>Cousin Jack</u></b>." He is in Alaska, California, the Rocky Mountains, Mexico, Central and South America, in Australia, India and Lake Superior. He is a first rate miner and possesses a certain sturdiness of frame and disposition that commends him to the observer. He works hard, eats well and fights bravely. He is, numerically, very strong in our northern mines, and, being, as a rule, steady, conservative and skillful, he finds ready employment. He likes mining; esteems his vocation among the most honorable, if not aristocratic. He despises the duties of an ordinary day laborer. In short, he is a born miner and nothing else... But "<b><u>Cousin Jack</u></b>'s" language attracts most attention. His dialect, pure and simple, is unique. He uses many English words with a strange twist, while other words of his you would look for in vain in Webster's unabridged... But we find in the mines many gentlemen of Cornish birth who are well educated and efficient, occupying positions of trust and responsibility. Many of the captains and agents are Cornishmen.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn2">2</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Quite when and where these Cornish emigrants started to be known as 'Cousin Jacks' is not wholly clear, unfortunately, and various theories have been proposed over the years, most of which locate the genesis of the term overseas in America, Australia or other places where Cornish miners emigrated to in the nineteenth century. The&nbsp;<i>Cornubian and Redruth Times</i>&nbsp;in 1908, for example, carried a piece suggesting that the term 'Cousin Jack' was first used in the California mining districts in the very late 1840s and spread out from there, with the additional claim that 'twenty years ago the term in Cornwall was unknown'; however, as we shall see, neither claim stands up to scrutiny, and the reality is perhaps even more interesting.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn3">3</a>)</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-exfrGNkOVqo/YAmYpHYdTWI/AAAAAAADP2Y/L6Bvc2jy2Y4RFtBUXCGSsaP6B6uryfqNgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1241/nla.obj-133090696-1.jpg"><img data-original-height="1241" data-original-width="1000" height="500" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-exfrGNkOVqo/YAmYpHYdTWI/AAAAAAADP2Y/L6Bvc2jy2Y4RFtBUXCGSsaP6B6uryfqNgCLcBGAsYHQ/w323-h400/nla.obj-133090696-1.jpg"></a></td></tr><tr><td>An Australian Cousin Jack cartoon by Oswald Pryor from 1915; the caption reads 'Cousin Jack miner:- "Call isself Cap'n 'e do; and I 'spoase ef the truth ez known, 'e never did a day's work underground in all 'ez life."' (Image: <a href="https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-133090696/view">Trove</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Looking at the documentary evidence for the usage of the term, a traditional place to start is with the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, which&nbsp;cites a number of examples of the use of Cousin Jack under their <i>Cousin, n.</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Jack, n.¹</i>&nbsp;entries. One, from Rolf Boldrewood's Australian novel&nbsp;<i>Miner's Right</i>&nbsp;of 1890, describes 'a short man, whose blue-black curly hair and deep-set eyes betrayed the Cousin Jack',(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn4">4</a>) whilst the earliest given is from&nbsp;<i>The Star</i> newspaper&nbsp;of&nbsp;Ballarat, Victoria (Australia) on the 19 March 1857, which runs as follows:</p><blockquote><p>They were ‘Tips’, and ‘Geordies’, and ‘<b><u>Cousin Jacks</u></b>’, altogether, and I did as well as I could.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn5">5</a>)&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The fact that both of the early citations are from Australia has sometimes been taken to suggest that the term could have emerged there, and it is certainly treated as such by the <i>English Dialect Dictionary</i>&nbsp;under&nbsp;its entry for&nbsp;<i>Cousin</i>.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn6">6</a>) In addition to these entries, the <i>OED </i>also records what it treats as a variant of Cousin Jack, <i>Cousin Jacky.</i> This is said to be documented first in the <i>South Australian Register</i>, from Adelaide,<i>&nbsp;</i>for 2 June 1854, via the following passage: 'John O'Connell then said to him, ‘You're a b——, <b><u>Cousin Jacky</u></b>, an't you?'', although the term also occurs in dialogue from Australian court reports of the 1840s too, <i>e.g.</i> 'I don't like <b><u>you cousin Jackies</u></b>, keep your own company, and I'll keep mine', which appeared in the&nbsp;<i>South Australian</i>, 30 May 1848.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn7">7</a>) However, 'Cousin Jacky' is not only documented in Australian contexts; it also appears in, for example, Thomas Quiller Couch's <i>East Cornwall Words</i>, published by the English Dialect Society in 1880, where it is treated as an East Cornwall term for a miner from West Cornwall:</p><blockquote><p>There is a marked difference between the speech of East and West Cornwall... At the beginning of the present century mining adventure, especially in the search for copper, became a furor in East Cornwall, and a passionate enthusiasm brought hither the skilled miners of the West, who flocked to the banks of Tywardreath Bay, and further east to the central granite ridge about the tors of Caradon. These immigrants brought with them and have left an infusion of their language, especially its technical portion, but I remember when it was a great mimetic feat, and productive of much mirth amongst us, to be able to imitate the talk of <b><u>Cousin Jacky</u></b>&nbsp;from Redruth or St. Just.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn8">8</a>)</p></blockquote><p>T. Q. Couch of Bodmin, the father of Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch (aka Q), was born in 1826 at Lansallos near Fowey, and seems to be here recounting a usage known to him in his youth, and is clearly referring to someone from West Cornwall, not a Cornish emigrant overseas. Likewise, in a letter printed in the&nbsp;<i>West Briton and Cornwall Advertiser</i> for 28 March 1862, Christopher Childs of Liskeard uses 'Cousin Jacky' in passing as a seemingly well-known, common and friendly term traditionally used between Cornish miners:</p><blockquote><p>The very motto of the Cornish miners, "One and All," at once bespeaks our favour, and indicates that [Cornish miners] are not naturally selfish, but on the contrary, are kindly disposed one toward another. If any one doubt this, let him attend the funeral of a miner, and observe how they congregate to pay the last sad tribute of respect, and drop a tear over the grave of their departed comrade... How forcibly does the familiar name "comrade," and the expression of "<b><u>Com'se along Cousin Jacky</u></b>," speak in favour of his friendly and social disposition.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn9">9</a>)</p></blockquote><p>In contrast, in Margaret Ann Courtney's <i>West Cornwall Words</i>&nbsp;(which was bound together with Couch's <i>East Cornwall Words&nbsp;</i>of 1880), 'Cousin Jacky' features as&nbsp;a local dialect term meaning 'a foolish person, a coward', with 'Cousin Jan' instead being given as the name for Cornishman—the latter variant is discussed further below, as is the former definition for Cousin Jacky.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn10">10</a>)&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xpy9aMOhrE8/YAmsAmjnqOI/AAAAAAADP3M/MB2xsu27hYkyWoIx53xnp4DtipZEHK_CACLcBGAsYHQ/s1162/CornishGhostStory1862.jpg"><img data-original-height="862" data-original-width="1162" height="370" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xpy9aMOhrE8/YAmsAmjnqOI/AAAAAAADP3M/MB2xsu27hYkyWoIx53xnp4DtipZEHK_CACLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h296/CornishGhostStory1862.jpg" width="500"></a></td></tr><tr><td>The first two pages of Elfin's <i>A Cornish Ghost Story</i>, first published at Truro sometime before 1862; these two pages are taken from an 1868 edition of the text in <i>Cornish Tales in Prose and Verse</i>&nbsp;(Truro: Netherton, 1868), pp. 37<span>–</span>8 (image: <a href="https://archive.org/details/cornishpales00treggoog/page/n243/mode/2up">Internet Archive</a>).</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Needless to say, the above references do seem to cast serious doubt upon the implication of the report in the&nbsp;<i>Cornubian and Redruth Times&nbsp;</i>in 1908 that the term 'Cousin Jack' and similar was unknown in Cornwall in the late 1880s, and in this light it is worth noting that Sharron Schwartz has, in fact, suggested that the 'evidence seems to point to the mines of Devonshire in the eighteenth century' as the place where the term Cousin Jack originated, via migrant Cornish miners seeking work in Devon rather than overseas.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn11">11</a>) Although she unfortunately offers no citation to …</p></div></div>

        <div>
          <p>A few months ago I experimented with DigitalOcean spaces as my backup solution that could <a href="https://mitjafelicijan.com/digitalocean-spaces-to-sync-between-computers.html">replace Dropbox eventually</a>. That solution worked quite nicely, and I was amazed how smashing together a couple of existing solutions would work this fine.</p>
<p>I have been running that solution in the background for a couple of months now and kind of forgot about it. But recent developments around deplatforming and having us people hostages of technology and big companies speed up my goals to become less dependent on <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/17/tech/google-antitrust-lawsuit/index.html">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2048680/dropbox-takes-a-peek-at-files.html">Dropbox</a> etc and take back some control.</p>
<p>I am not a conspiracy theory nut, but to be honest, what these companies are doing lately is out of control. It is a matter of principle at this point. I have almost completely degoogled my life all the way from ditching Gmail, YouTube and most of the services surrounding Google. And I must tell you, I feel so good. I haven't felt this way for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>Anyways. Let's get to the meat of things.</strong></p>
<p>Before you continue you should read my post about <a href="https://mitjafelicijan.com/digitalocean-spaces-to-sync-between-computers.html">syncing to Dropbox</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also to note, I am using Linux on my machine with Gnome desktop environment. This should work on MacOS too. To use this on Windows I suggest using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">Subsystem for Linux</a> or <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="folder-structure">Folder structure</h2>
<p>I liked structure from Dropbox. One folder where everything is located and synced. So, that's why adopted this also for my sync setup.</p>
<pre><code>~/Vault
   ↳ backup
   ↳ bin
   ↳ documents
   ↳ projects
</code></pre>
<p>All of my code is located in <code>~/Vault/projects</code> folder. And most of the projects are Git repositories. I do not use this sync method for backup per see but in case I reinstall my machine I can easily recreate all the important folder structure with one quick command. No external drives needed that can fail etc.</p>
<h2 id="sync-script">Sync script</h2>
<p>My sync script is located in <code>~/Vault/bin/vault-backup.sh</code></p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# dconf load /com/gexperts/Tilix/ &lt; tilix.dconf
# 0 2 * * * sh ~/Vault/bin/vault-backup.sh

cd ~/Vault/backup/dotfiles

MACHINE=$(whoami)@$(hostname)
mkdir -p $MACHINE
cd $MACHINE

cp ~/.config/VSCodium/User/settings.json settings.json
cp ~/.s3cfg s3cfg
cp ~/.bash_extended bash_extended
cp ~/.ssh ssh -rf

codium --list-extensions &gt; vscode-extension.txt
dconf dump /com/gexperts/Tilix/ &gt; tilix.dconf

cd ~/Vault
s3cmd sync --delete-removed --exclude 'node_modules/*' --exclude '.git/*' --exclude '.venv/*' ./ s3://bucket-name/backup/

echo `date +"%D %T"` &gt;&gt; ~/.vault.log

notify-send \
	-u normal \
	-i /usr/share/icons/Adwaita/96x96/status/security-medium-symbolic.symbolic.png \
	"Vault sync succeded at `date +"%D %T"`"
</code></pre>
<p>This script also backups some of the dotfiles I use and sends notification to Gnome notification center. It is a straightforward solution. Nothing special going on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One obvious benefit of this is that I can omit syncing Node's <code>node_modules</code> or Python's <code>.venv</code> and <code>.git</code> folders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use this script in a combination with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">Cron</a>.</p>
<pre><code>0 2 * * * sh ~/Vault/bin/vault-backup.sh
</code></pre>
<p>When you start syncing your local stuff with a remote server you can review your items on DigitalOcean.</p>
<p><img src="https://mitjafelicijan.com/assets/dropbox-sync/dropbox-spaces.png" alt="Dropbox Spaces"></p>
<p>I have been using this script now for quite some time, and it's working flawlessly. I also uninstalled Dropbox and stopped using it completely.</p>
<p>All I need to do is write a Bash script that does the reverse and downloads from remote server to local folder. This could be another post.</p>

January 25, 2021 | https://www.lifespan.io/news/glucosamine-may-be-a-caloric-restriction-mimetic/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.lifespan.io/news/glucosamine-may-be-a-caloric-restriction-mimetic/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Glucosamine emulates caloric restriction in rats due to mitohormesis.&nbsp;</p><div>
																
								
								
<p><a href="https://www.lifespan.io/news/glucosamine/">Glucosamine</a> is a polysaccharide that naturally occurs in cartilaginous joint tissues and is involved in protein and lipid synthesis. Glucosamine is also present in other tissues, such as skin, nails, bones, and ligaments. Synovial fluid contains glucosamine and occupies the space between joints, helping to reduce the friction of joint surfaces. Glucosamine is commonly taken as a supplement to help with the joint pain and inflammation associated with aging.</p>
<p><b>What does not kill us makes us stronger</b></p>
<p>The <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33478352/">study</a> we want to spotlight today shows how glucosamine produces a caloric restriction-like effect in rats. The researchers treated young rats and accelerated aging rats with regular doses of glucosamine, then they examined a number of aging biomarkers.</p>
<p>There was a significant rise in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in both young and accelerated aging rats. ROS are reactive molecules and free radicals derived from oxygen, and while they do have some beneficial uses, such as being used by immune cells as a component of the killing response to combat microbial invasion, they are also very harmful to cells. Free radicals each possess an unpaired electron, making them highly reactive and thus able to damage all macromolecules, including lipids, proteins and nucleic acids.</p>
<p>ROS is produced as a byproduct during the mitochondrial electron transport of aerobic respiration or by oxidoreductase enzymes and metal catalyzed oxidation. Mitochondria also produce increasing amounts of potentially harmful ROS as they become increasingly dysfunctional, and mitochondrial dysfunction is <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/topic/mitochondrial-dysfunction/">a hallmark of aging</a>.</p>
<p>It was originally thought that only phagocytic cells, which protect the body by ingesting harmful foreign particles, bacteria, and dead or dying cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils, produced ROS. This was shown to be incorrect, and more recent research shows that ROS has a role in cellular signaling, serving as both an intra- and intercellular messenger and influencing gene expression, apoptosis, and the activation of cellular signaling cascades.</p>
<p>The researchers suggest that glucosamine spurs a transient increase in ROS, which, in turn, triggers a protective mitohormetic response. Mitohormesis describes a process in which low levels of mitochondrial ROS act as signaling molecules to trigger a cascade of cellular events that protect the cells from harmful effects. Essentially, the small amount of stress caused by the ROS encourages the cell to raise its shields.</p>
<p>They believe that this response produces an effect similar to the stress response observed in caloric restriction, and multiple biomarkers showed that this is the case. The old saying “What does not kill us makes us stronger” appears to apply here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aging is strongly correlated with several non-communicable disorders such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative conditions. Glucosamine (2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose, GlcN) is a naturally occurring amino sugar and is reported to act as a caloric restriction mimetic (CRM). In young and D-galactose-induced accelerated rat aging models, we tested a persistent oral dietary dose of GlcN and evaluated various aging biomarkers in erythrocytes and plasma. A significant increase in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed in GlcN treated young and accelerated senescent rat model. Increased value of Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Potential (FRAP), Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), and Plasma membrane reduced system (PMRS) was observed. We suggest that GlcN induces a mitohormetic impact by a transient increase in ROS. Our findings indicate that GlcN may be a successful CRM.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p>It should be noted that these results are in rats, but the idea that similar effects may occur in humans taking glucosamine is not beyond the realm of possibility. Caloric restriction increases lifespan in multiple species, so finding a way to emulate this effect without the need to engage in caloric restriction could have the potential to help people with metabolic conditions, such as diabetes and obesity.</p>
<p>It appears to be the case that glucosamine significantly reduces all-cause mortality in humans, according to not <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/news/glucosamine-supplementation-reduces-all-cause-mortality/">one</a> but <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/news/human-study-links-glucosamine-and-chondroitin-to-reduced-mortality/">two</a> large-scale studies conducted last year. Glucosamine is cheap, readily available, and has compelling health and safety data behind it, and it would be a dietary supplement worth considering for <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/news/developing-a-science-based-personal-longevity-strategy/">a science-based personal longevity strategy</a>.</p>

        <p>Welcome back. This is the second post in my <em>Terrible Compiler for a Useless Language</em> series, in which I write about my attempt to implement a native Brainfuck compiler for x64 Linux. In this post, I'll be covering a basic parser for Brainfuck. Previous posts in the series:</p>

<p>Yes, how could you tell?</p>
<h2 id="i-got-the-acronym-joke-in-the-last-post-and-i-didn-t-like-it-it-s-in-poor-taste-personally-offends-me"><em>I got the acronym "joke" in the last post and I didn't like it. It's in poor taste/personally offends me.</em></h2>
<p>I don't like that joke either. Some kind of police force is necessary for society to function and we shouldn't say mean things about cops who aren't doing anything wrong (notice the lack of a comma before "who" here before you jump to conclusions). Worse yet, the acronym is <strong>badly spelled</strong>. But I <em>just couldn't resist</em>.</p>
<h2 id="get-to-the-point"><em>Get to the point</em>.</h2>
<p>But of course. Let's examine how Brainfuck works. What does Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">have to say</a> about it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notable for its extreme minimalism, the language consists of only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are the eight commands, then?</p>
<p><code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> respectively move the pointer backward and forward by one memory cell. As we've already mentioned at the very beginning, Brainfuck's memory cells are one byte in size and there's thirty thousand of them. These are our variables. Those of you, dear readers, coming from dynamically-typed languages like Python and JS, should be happy to hear that Brainfuck has no types.<br>
<code>-</code> and <code>+</code> decrement and increment the number in the memory cell at our pointer.<br>
<code>,</code> and <code>.</code> respectively get and put out one byte of data from/to the standard input/output.<br>
<code>[</code> and <code>]</code> are where things get <em>interesting</em> and Turing-complete - the former means "if the value at the pointer is 0, skip over to the instruction after the matching <code>]</code>". The latter means "if the value isn't zero, jump back to the instruction after the matching <code>[</code>". If this looks like a <code>while</code> loop to you, that's because it is one. Obviously, all square brackets must be paired up.</p>
<p>All other characters in a Brainfuck source file are considered comments and can be safely ignored. To work, then! Let's declare a new Cargo project with <code>cargo new bfc-rs</code>. Because we're trying to be slightly more professional this time, we won't stuff all the code in <code>main.rs</code>, we'll also create a <code>lib.rs</code> to hold the program's logic.</p>
<h2 id="defining-the-instructions">Defining the instructions</h2>
<p>Our first step should be to define a data type for Brainfuck commands:</p>
<pre><code><span>/// Type representing a standard Brainfuck instruction.
</span><span>#[</span><span>derive</span><span>(Debug, PartialEq)] </span><span>// this is for tests
</span><span>enum </span><span>BrainfuckInstr {
    </span><span>/// Move the data pointer back one cell.
</span><span>    PointerDec,
    </span><span>/// Move the data pointer forward one cell.
</span><span>    PointerInc,
    </span><span>/// Decrement the value of the current memory cell.
</span><span>    DataDec,
    </span><span>/// Increment the value of the current memory cell.
</span><span>    DataInc,
    </span><span>/// Get a byte from the standard input and store it in the current memory cell.
</span><span>    GetByte,
    </span><span>/// Write the current memory cell's value to the standard output.
</span><span>    PutByte,
    </span><span>/// Begin a while loop conditional on the current value not being zero.
</span><span>    WhileNonzero,
    </span><span>/// Close the while loop.
</span><span>    EndWhile
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>That's a secret. You'll find out two blogposts from now.</p>
<p>Anyway, that was easy. Now let's write a Brainfuck program that writes a newline to the standard output, because typing out a full Hello World would be a stupidly large amount of work:</p>
<pre><code><span>++++++++++ Add 10 to the current byte to make a newline or 0x0A byte
. Print it
</span></code></pre>
<p>I've saved it as <code>newline.bf</code> in our project's directory for later use. Now let's define a <code>Parser</code> struct, a <code>parse</code> function and write a test for it before we implement anything, because I think "Test-Driven Development" looks good on a resumé. From lib.rs:</p>
<pre><code><span>#[</span><span>cfg</span><span>(test)] </span><span>// only declare a "tests" module when the Rust compiler is in test mode
</span><span>mod </span><span>tests;

</span><span>/// The syntax errors possible.
</span><span>#[</span><span>derive</span><span>(Debug)]
</span><span>enum </span><span>SyntaxError {
    </span><span>/// A closing square bracket was found at the contained line:index position, but there was no opening square bracket before it.
</span><span>    PrematureEndWhile(</span><span>usize</span><span>, </span><span>usize</span><span>),
    </span><span>/// The last while loop opened, at the contained line:index position, has no closing bracket.
</span><span>    UnclosedWhile(</span><span>usize</span><span>, </span><span>usize</span><span>)
}
</span><span>/// Struct responsible for parsing Brainfuck.
</span><span>struct </span><span>Parser; </span><span>// empty because it has no internal state yet
</span><span>impl </span><span>Parser {
    </span><span>fn </span><span>parse</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>code</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>str</span><span>) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;BrainfuckInstr&gt;, SyntaxError&gt; {
        unimplemented!()
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The contents of our <code>tests.rs</code> file will be as follows:</p>
<pre><code><span>const </span><span>NEWLINE_PRINTING_PROGRAM</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>str </span><span>= include_str!("</span><span>../newline.bf</span><span>"); </span><span>// same thing as we did with the NASM template while writing HWDPC
</span><span>use super</span><span>::*; </span><span>// import all symbols from our parent module, the library root
</span><span>use </span><span>BrainfuckInstr::*;
#[</span><span>test</span><span>]
</span><span>fn </span><span>test_newline_program</span><span>() {
    </span><span>let mut</span><span> parser = Parser;
    </span><span>let</span><span> output = parser
    .</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>NEWLINE_PRINTING_PROGRAM</span><span>)
    .</span><span>expect</span><span>("</span><span>The newline program contains no syntax errors, something is wrong with the parser.</span><span>");
    </span><span>let</span><span> expected_output: Vec&lt;BrainfuckInstr&gt; = vec![
        DataInc, DataInc, DataInc, DataInc, DataInc,
        DataInc, DataInc, DataInc, DataInc, DataInc,
        PutByte
    ];
    assert_eq!(&amp;output, &amp;expected_output)
}
</span></code></pre><h2 id="writing-the-parser-logic">Writing the parser logic</h2>
<p>If we invoke <code>cargo test</code> right now, the test will unsurprisingly fail, because the <code>unimplemented!()</code> macro in <code>parse</code> makes the compiler think a value of the right type gets returned, but at runtime panics (=crashes) the thread it's running on, thus failing any test we put it in. Let's get to work actually implementing <code>parse</code>, then.</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>parse</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>code</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>str</span><span>) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;BrainfuckInstr&gt;, SyntaxError&gt; {

        </span><span>for </span><span>(ch_number, ch) in line.</span><span>chars</span><span>().</span><span>enumerate</span><span>() {
            output.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>match</span><span> ch {

                '</span><span>&gt;</span><span>' =&gt; PointerInc,
                '</span><span>-</span><span>' =&gt; DataDec,
                '</span><span>+</span><span>' =&gt; DataInc,
                '</span><span>,</span><span>' =&gt; GetByte,
                '</span><span>.</span><span>' =&gt; PutByte,
                '</span><span>[</span><span>' =&gt; WhileNonzero,
                '</span><span>]</span><span>' =&gt; EndWhile,
                _ =&gt; { </span><span>continue</span><span>; </span><span>/* skip this iteration if the character is something else */</span><span>}
            });
        }
    }
    </span><span>// Don't worry about the line and character numbers yet.
    </span><span>Ok(output)
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now, our tests pass, the whole one. This is too good, we need more tests.</p>
<h2 id="test-programs-meant-to-fail">Test programs meant to fail</h2>
<p>Let's write two faulty programs, <code>premature.bf</code> and <code>unmatched.bf</code>, and the corresponding tests.</p>
<pre><code><span>++++.,

</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>+++--.+[+
++[] This should crash the compiler because we never close the outer while loop.
Hey, this means we can use proper punctuation here, cause this code won't run.
</span></code></pre>
<p>The tests:</p>
<pre><code><span>#[</span><span>test</span><span>]
</span><span>fn </span><span>test_premature_program</span><span>() {

<p>These will of course fail:</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p>We haven't actually implemented any bracket-matching behavior, so the parser just keeps producing "valid" lists of instructions wrapped in the <code>Ok</code> variant of Rust's <code>Result</code>. Because we're <code>expect</code>ing an <code>err</code>or, this fails our test. What we want is error data that contains the location of the mistake in the source code.</p>
<p>How could we do this? Well, you see, early on in uni I had this one guy teach one of my courses. He was probably a better researcher than he was a teacher, as he was openly rude to his students and didn't really care to explain anything. His default answer to any question was "it's all in The Book", and his favorite joke was letting someone muddle their way through an exercise, nod along and encourage them, then, when they finished, proclaiming smugly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, this is all completely wrong. Go read the relevant chapter at home, class is over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking back on it, he was kind of an asshole. Or maybe he was going through hard times, but that would mean I don't get to be self-righteous and talk smack about him.</p>
<h2 id="does-this-sob-story-emotionally-colored-digression-lead-anywhere"><em>Does this <del>sob story</del> emotionally-colored digression lead anywhere?</em></h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="js-article">
    

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Last year I published my first book with a publisher, <a href="https://handsonbughunting.com/"><em>Hands on Bug Hunting For Penetration Testers</em></a>.</p>

<p>Going in, I was determined to set up a workflow that would allow me to:</p>

<p>1) Keep a backup of the book.<br>
2) Allow me to easily track my writing progress.<br>
3) Work on the book offline.<br>
4) Keep my own copy of the book.</p>

<p>What set of tools could possibly control the versioning, backup, access control, and portability of plain text?</p>

<p>I had all the tools in front of me - and had already started using them. I could use a git repo to keep a backup of the book and track changes, using Unix tools like <code>wc</code>, <code>cat</code>, <code>ag</code> (basically a faster <code>grep</code>) and others to accomplish everything I needed to - in a workflow I was already comfortable with.</p>

<p>It was tooling kismet.</p>

<h2 id="layout">Layout</h2>

<p>Here’s how the book repo is laid out.</p>

<pre><code>book/
    code/
    docs/
    manuscript/
    promotions/
    cover.jpg
    outline.md
    review-notes.md
    technical-instructions.md
</code></pre>

<p>The directories should be pretty self-explanatory and, as you can tell, deal with more than just the immediate manuscript. <code>promotions</code> lets me keep track of guest blog ideas, content strategy campaigns, and tactics I’m coordinating together with my publisher’s marketing team. <code>code</code> is all my code (surprise!) Although I haven’t found it necessary yet to program a solution for inlining the code snippets, yet (I just copy them over), it could definitely be done.
<code>docs</code> is for research I’m compiling in the course of writing the book, so I can ensure everything is properly cited, and I can pull in the original document for my publisher to inspect if they want to know the source of an idea, statistic, graph, or other quoted resource.</p>

<p>The files are also pretty direct. <code>outline.md</code> is an outline, <code>review-notes.md</code> is a file where I keep <em>my</em> notes on <em>my publishers</em> notes, thinking in text about how to shape the book using their suggested edits. <code>technical-instructions.md</code> is where I’ve kept any extra-textual instructions on setup and troubleshooting, for the technical editor to review, and the <code>cover.jpg</code> is, well, the cover.</p>

<h2 id="the-manuscript">The Manuscript</h2>

<p>But let’s take a deeper dive into the meatiest part of this setup - the actual <code>manuscript</code>.</p>

<pre><code>book/
    code/
    docs/
    manuscript/
        Preface.txt
        Assessment.txt
        Ch1_Introduction.txt
        Ch2_Choosing_Your_Hunting_Ground.txt
        Ch3_Preparing_for_an_Engagement.txt
        Ch4_Unsanitized_Data_A_Case_Study_in_XSS.txt
        Ch5_SQLi_Code_Injection_and_Scanners.txt
        Ch6_CSRF_and_Insecure_Session_Authentication.txt
        Ch7_XML_External_Entities_XXE.txt
        Ch8_Access_Control_and_Security_through_Obscurity.txt
        Ch9_Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Social_Engineering.txt
        Ch10_Framework_and_Application-Specific_Vulnerabilities.txt
        Ch11_Formatting_your_Report.txt
        Ch12_Other_Tools.txt
        Ch13_Other_(Out-of-Scope)_Vulnerabilities.txt
        Ch14_Going_Further.txt
        images/
    promotions/
    cover.jpg
    outline.md
    review-notes.md
    technical-instructions.md
</code></pre>

<p>Flat is better than nested, always. Rather than have chapter directories and possibly keeping images together, I went this route so that I could keep this nice at-a-glance view.</p>

<p>You might be noticing though - why use the <code>txt</code> file extension here but not in other files like <code>review-notes.md</code>, where I use the <code>md</code>? That’s because of a simple wrapper I wrote out around <code>wc</code>. I call it <code>txt</code> and keep it symlinked as a command under <code>/usr/local/bin/txt</code>.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

total=0

for FILE in `find . -type f -name "*.txt"`

do
    wc -w $FILE
    words=`wc -w &lt; $FILE | tr -d ' '`
    total=$(($total + $words))
done

printf "%'d" $total

echo " words
</code></pre>

<p>All this does is add the word count returned by <code>wc</code> and show the total word count of all the <code>.txt</code> files under the path where the command is called, with a file-by-file breakdown As you can see, it only targets <code>.txt</code> files, so using that convention we can keep <code>.md</code> out of the count.</p>

<p>How about <code>images</code>? For that directory I try to use its own naming convention:</p>

<pre><code>arachni-cli-sqli.png                      
arachni-help.png                          
arachni-html-report.png                   
arachni-sqli-timing-attack-part-two.png   
arachni-sqli-timing-attack.png
</code></pre>

<p>There’s no formal convention of chapter-topic-modifier (next time!) but even just grouping common images under compatible topic buckets everything together in an alphabetically-sorted view, and makes it easier to navigate. And because the <code>images</code> are in the <code>manuscript</code> directory, right alongside the individual chapters, referencing an image in a chapter looks like:</p>

<pre><code>![alt image text](/images/some-image-path.png)
</code></pre>

<p>Coincidentally (or not) the layout of my Hugo blog allows me to use this exact syntax and path reference.</p>



<p>So what do I use to take advantage of this all-markdown, all-the-time workflow? A few things</p>

<h3 id="sublime-text-markdownediting-markdownpreview">Sublime Text + MarkdownEditing + MarkdownPreview</h3>

<p>Sublime Text has a couple of great plugins for working with Markdown. Together, these two plugins give you syntax highlighting, a better background / text theme, centers the text, and allows you to use a shortcut to preview the document in your browser.</p>

<h3 id="bat">Bat</h3>

<p>Do you use <code>bat</code>? You should. A “cat clone with wings,” it provides beautiful syntax highlighting, <code>less</code>, and a bunch of other goodies, while also acting as a direct drop-in for <code>cat</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2ea95c30ed625376e3f345df019f4bdf0079a71e/c94a8/images/bat-highlighting.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="ag">Ag</h3>

<p><code>ag</code> is just a faster <code>grep</code>, basically - and having access to quick, easy, full-text search functionality is key. Being able to easily answer questions like “When have a previously referenced OWASP?” in order to avoid repeating myself, or get a quick refresher on how much background I’d given or what I’d already covered, is great.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/841bd5a3f8e3cc92f6ae3526c4271515d888f781/dd196/images/ag-example.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="write">Write</h3>

<p>I paid for the <a href="https://writeapp.co/">Write app</a> a few years ago to try it out, and though I’ve moved on to Sublime Text, I keep it for it’s greate translation ability. Using it I can convert a markdown file to a <code>pdf</code>, <code>doc</code>, <code>rtf</code>, or other common format.</p>

<h3 id="anything-really">Anything, Really</h3>

<p>There’s so much more I could incorporate into the workflow that I haven’t already. Maybe I could set it up so that if I didn’t push a commit of a certain size in a certain period to Github, I’d get a Slack reminder - or use my plain text corpus to create a NN that would try to autocomplete my writing in my own voice. The sky’s the limit! Using the plain-text, markdown-first approach opens up the possible ecosystem to include pretty much anything in the Unix mold.</p>

<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>

<p>Using this workflow I get all the advantages a programmer does with code - a robust version history, a repo back up system (through strategic use of <code>remotes</code>), easy collaboration (add your editor as a github collaborator), and I don’t get locked into any proprietary formats, or rely on some third-party online editor where I fundamentally don’t control what I’m writing.</p>

<p>And I get the portability of markdown! Though my publisher, Packt, requires you to use an online CMS to write books with them, it lacks some of the tooling I need (and has the always-online problem). But because it also uses / supports markdown through a combination markdown/WYSIWYG system, all I have to do is copy and paste each chapter in as I finish it.</p>

<h2 id="parting-thoughts">Parting Thoughts</h2>

<p>The beauty of this system is that you can transpose it onto just about anything. If you write a blog using a static site generator (like I am), then you’re probably already formatting your posts as markdown files under a <code>posts</code> or similar folder.</p>

<p>When all long-form writing projects (documentation, books, blog posts) can use the same system, you get a beautiful convergence of tools that lets you <em>just write</em>, without getting hung up on which particular solution (Word, Google Docs, flat file) fits what particular content.</p>

        <h2 itemprop="headline">Names to avoid in Software Engineering</h2>
        <p itemprop="about"><i>An incomplete list of poor names for libraries, modules, projects and teams</i></p>
        <p>
        by  on <i itemprop="datePublished">2021-01-24</i></p>
        <p><span itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>There's an old joke that says the two hardest problems in Computer Science are
cache invalidation, naming things and off-by-one errors. Now, giving good names
is as much an art as a science, and there are many different schools of advice.
When it comes to variable and function naming, <a href="https://www.lysator.liu.se/c/pikestyle.html">Rob Pike's notes on C
Style</a> capture the essential goals
of good naming practice. However, the Tao of Naming is going to be a contentious
topic, and I have no interest in opening that can of worms today.</p>

<p>Names that stink, however, are much easier to spot. Here is an incomplete list
of names that should give you pause if you ever encounter them in the wild. Some
of these bad names you can fix with just a simple commit. Some of these names
indicate a much deeper problem, that will require you to investigate whether the
object that bears that name should actually exist as one object at all, or if it
must be refactored or reorg into different units.</p>

<h2>File under M for Misc</h2>

<p>Most programming languages offer developers a way to group collections of
similar functions and types into software packages or modules. For some
programmers, the ability to have a place to put code that's shared in one place
is all that they want from this feature, and they approach code organization
with the same amount of thought as their second-from-the-bottom kitchen drawer.</p>

<p>This is why you end up with software modules with names like:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>utils</code></li>
<li><code>lib</code></li>
<li><code>tools</code></li>
<li><code>misc</code></li>
<li><code>etc</code></li>
<li><code>common</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever I see <code>common</code>, I'm very tempted to commit additional packages named
<code>rare</code>, <code>epic</code> and <code>legendary</code>, and have the contents of each of them be just:</p>

<pre><code># You must reach a higher level to use this code
</code></pre>

<p>There's nothing wrong with putting code in a misc place <em>temporarily</em>, while you
work on it. But when you find that the code is already being reused by different
components in your project, it's time to put a little effort into categorizing
what those <code>tools</code> you're stuffing into the drawer are, so that other developers
know to look in there when they need it.</p>

<h2>The ThingDoer is a thing that does something</h2>

<p>When developers adopt design patterns they picked up from textbooks, college
classes or blogs, we can sometimes forget to make the name relevant to the
codebase or task at hand. Perhaps the developers put in a little more
abstraction than they should have into the code. Or, there might be a class that
could just have been a function or a for-loop. This is where we run into the
category of <code>ThingDoer</code> names, like:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Executor</code></li>
<li><code>Manager</code></li>
<li><code>Visitor</code></li>
<li><code>Transformer</code></li>
<li><code>Factory</code></li>
<li><code>SyncService</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Such names might be appropriate for superclasses and interfaces but are not
great matches for business logic. If these classes genuinely need to exist, at
least consider including more context about what ThingDoer does, or how it does
it, in the name.</p>

<h2>Watch out, I'm using Computer Science!</h2>

<p>My conjecture is that developers with an academic background are susceptible to
the trap of naming classes after concepts in computer science. Classwork focuses
on teaching core abstract data types, without introducing any real-world
embellishments. However, in real-world situations the fact that your
<code>LibraryBook</code>s are a <code>Node</code> in a <code>Graph</code> is often less important than the fact
that they are <code>LibraryBook</code>s.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>-Data</code></li>
<li><code>-Info</code></li>
<li><code>Entity</code></li>
<li><code>Set</code></li>
<li><code>Node</code></li>
<li><code>Graph</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Everything is data. I haven't thought through whether I agree with that
statement philosophically. However, when you're programming, <em>everything is data</em>.
Therefore, adding the word <code>Data</code> or <code>Info</code> at the end of a class or variable
name is free of any semantic content.</p>

<p>Similarly, any references between objects in your programs will form a graph, by
definition. Is there something specifically Graph-y about your class, so that
everyone needs to be reminded every time they type it? In the instance of a
purpose-built graph library, that is definitely the case. For the rest of us, we
can name our <code>PetNetworkGraph</code> simply <code>PetNetwork</code>, or even more tersely,
<code>Pets</code>.</p>

<h2>Coordination problems</h2>

<p>Communication and coordination is one of the hardest parts of getting a single
group to do something new, and that is especially true for engineering. This
effect compounds drastically as the number of groups involved grows. The next
names are not specifically bad names, but signify projects that should be
treated with care.</p>

<ul>
<li>Project Voltron</li>
<li>Megazord</li>
<li>Any musical supergroup</li>
<li>Any project named after an Anime mecha that combines into a bigger mecha</li>
</ul>

<p>These names are usually attached to an effort requiring multiple (more than two)
separate teams to coordinate in some deep way. Perhaps the goal is to bring each
of several teams on legacy platforms onto the new standard software. Or maybe
these teams now all need to share data, and build pair-wise data integrations
between all of them. You can probably think of a few examples yourself.</p>

<p>Just like the Power Rangers, this project can succeed if it is run with
teamwork, strong leadership and technical maturity. Nevertheless be on your
guard when you see a Project Voltron.</p>

<h2>This team has an unspecified goal</h2>

<p>The final category I want to touch on today is something that I don't yet fully
understand myself. Engineering organizations of a sufficient size naturally
break into sub-teams that are tasked with specific business functions.
Sometimes, among them, we find a team who is meant to be "closest to the code",
the "most technical of them all". They are responsible for a grab bag of things,
such as developer experience, code standards, performance and libraries. And
they are usually called something like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Platform team</li>
<li>Core team</li>
<li>Core Platform Team (true story)</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't quite know what to make of this team. I've worked on a few Platform
teams myself, and my experience there has generally been very pleasant.</p>

<p>However, <a href="https://danverbraganza.com/writings/the-phoenix-project">The Phoenix Project</a>, changed my
thinking around how engineering teams deliver value. Rather than committing to
large pre-planned projects, it is better to deliver value in small increments.
No value has been created until something is in the hands of a customer, and
so-called Work in Progress represents a large liability on the sheets of the
business.</p>

<p>Based on this, I've now grown skeptical of whether confining engineering talent
to work on "the Platform" without specific business objectives is wise.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/">Don't Call Yourself a
Programmer</a>, Patrick McKenzie quotes Peter Drucker on the difference between Profit
Centres and Cost Centres. In every business, some parts of the organization
directly make the money, and the rest of the business spends money, supporting
them. Patrick admonishes professionals to be attached to the former rather than
the latter.</p>

<p>I am concerned that Platform Teams generally read as cost centers to outsiders.
Even if the Platform Team delivers a piece of technology that is critical for a
product launch, the product team is the one getting the shout-out at all hands.
This is why I am tentatively adding Core Platform Team as another name to
avoid.</p>

Today it's well-suited to people with a side project, that's fine, it doesn't need to address a large market on day one.

The leap of faith we need to make is that there will be an Etsy or Shopify movement and that you can dramatically grow the market for people wanting to build a full-time business out of their side hustle and that some of these businesses will grow large (but that some percentage won't outgrow and leave the platform).

I don't think you're on the path to building full-on enterprise software, nor do I think you should be, but it means that there need to be significantly more small pure software products that want to transform into a small business. This is totally possible but I don't have conviction around that market today."</p><h3 data-id="7b0d8c1b4a96453f8c8615d6d5a9c5d3"><a href="#7b0d8c1b4a96453f8c8615d6d5a9c5d3" title="Index Ventures"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.indexventures.com/">Index Ventures</a></h3><p>"You're in a great area code but you need to be headed towards a specific address."</p><h3 data-id="b66e0bb209ef418bb79e365b2671758e"><a href="#b66e0bb209ef418bb79e365b2671758e" title="Earnest Capital"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://earnestcapital.com/">Earnest Capital</a></h3><p>"Your target customers may be bootstrappers, but what Saasify's trying to do as a platform is much larger and therefore a better fit for traditional VC."</p><h3 data-id="7bc741ab42754f6eaaec3c38e75a7857"><a href="#7bc741ab42754f6eaaec3c38e75a7857" title="SaaS Group"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://saas.group/">SaaS Group</a></h3><p>"Saasify is not worth much if it doesn’t have paying customers.

But what early stage VCs really care about is the size of your initial target market, since trying to build a solution that would apply to all of SaaS is pretty vague and difficult to imagine how you'd get there. </p><p>Stripe is a great example of an index company which fundamentally enables a significant chunk of online payments and SaaS. Saasify, on the other hand, provides a go-to-market solution for developer-oriented SaaS APIs.</p><p>It's pretty difficult for me to imagine Saasify's path to $100M revenue, which is the VC litmus test for whether or not an idea is worth their time. There are definitely some new-age VCs like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://earnestcapital.com/">Earnest Capital</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.indie.vc/">Indie VC</a> that are looking to change this mindset by focusing on profitability over growth, but ultimately my goal with Saasify was more aligned with the traditional VC model of building a high-growth, high-impact company to solve a problem at scale.</p><p>The core problem I had set out to solve with Saasify was helping developers go independent.</p><p>And after several pivots, I ended up with a solution that didn't really solve the original problem that I cared about. It definitely had some early signs of traction, but no real signs of revenue traction or growth potential due to the quality of Micro SaaS products that we attracted.</p><div><p><span role="img" aria-label="⭐">⭐</span></p><p><b><em>I'm currently working to transition Saasify to a more open, community-led platform.</em></b>

<p>UPDATE: Since this blew up 1. I wrote this mostly in response <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/how-wallstreetbets-pushed-gamestop-shares-to-the-moon">this article in Bloomberg</a>. 2. If you want to follow me on Twitter for more hot takes on internet culture and marketing stuff you can do that here: <a href="https://twitter.com/JeromySonne">@jeromysonne</a></p>



<p>I want to preface all of this by saying I am not an investing expert. I currently hold no publicly traded companies’ stock. (Though I might I haven’t logged into Robinhood in a while). What I am pretty good at though is internet culture and understanding communities through that lens. I also don’t agree with the Wallstreetbets culture. I’m just trying to explain it.</p>



<p>The recent dramatic fall and meteoric rise of Gamestop via the short squeeze that happened has a lot of technical reasons that people a lot better at finance can explain. What keeps coming up though is Wallstreetbets and their hand in taking a stock that seemed doomed to failure and rocketing it to new heights. I’m seeing a lot of well-meaning takes on their role that generally miss the “why” of the community and what it does / how it exists. After reading a well-written article in Bloomberg (that ultimately misses the point on WSB). I thought I would take a moment to give some insights.</p>



<p>References to tendies, autism, gay bears, and a bunch of other things don’t really make a lot of sense on the surface (and some make even less sense once you dive in). The culture of Wallstreetbets is an interesting one, to say the least, that has a lot of its language and customs rooted in 4chan. As 4chan users have grown up, migrated to other corners of the internet, and spread their language it’s continued on and evolved in different spaces. You saw a lot of this with the_donald on Reddit a few years ago before it was banned and a lot of similar overlap in language between what the community was and what WSB is now. (Twitter is so late to the party compared to Reddit).</p>



<p>The basic surface-level story of WSB is this. It’s a bunch of autistic losers that live in their mom’s basement who are gambling what little money they have to try and become rich to live lifestyles of hedonism. Since they are basement dwellers their obvious food of choice is chicken tenders aka tendies that they trade in their GBPs (Good boy points) to their mom so they can get more. In this world, they earn good boy points by doing well at stocks.</p>



<p>On the surface, it seems really weird but it’s mostly a type of gallows humor that permeates a lot of especially young millennials and zennial men. That nothing really means anything, that no one cares about them (or in some cases actively hate them), and so they reject buying in on the society they feel actively scorns them. I’ll resist the urge to add my personal opinions or quote Fight Club here, but I’m mostly saying all this to get you in their head.</p>



<p>As someone that deals with some (in the grand scheme of things minor) mental health issues around panic attacks and anxiety attacks the “Fuck it if nothing means anything I may as well do what I want” attitude on a self-destructive and nihilistic level makes sense to me. It’s not logical but it makes sense. If nothing means anything you may as well do what you want and try and have some fun before the existential crisis of death takes us all. To do that though you need cash, and most of us are slammed with student debt, increased COL, and stagnant wages as compared to our parents’ generation. All the “boomer” advice we’re given doesn’t really make sense especially when it comes to the dreaded value investing that we’re told to do when it comes to stocks especially in light of the financial crisis in 2008.</p>



<p>See back in the day if you played the rules, worked the job, saved the money you could mostly live a pretty good life. The system was there and it had your back you just had to play by the rules. At some point that changed. Understanding that fundamentally you can do “everything right” and be totally fucked anyways, never able to achieve your dreams regardless of what you do or don’t do is a shitty feeling. Along comes WSB.</p>



<p>Suddenly, there’s a chance. Not a big one, but a chance to get out of your situation and live the life you want. You can do everything right and never be able to retire anyway, OR you can take super speculative positions in the stock market by making giant bets on risky options that, if you happen to be right, could make you rich. You’ve broken the cycle and you can live the life you want. Worst case? You’re right back where you started.</p>



<p>““<strong>If you owe</strong>&nbsp;your bank a hundred pounds,&nbsp;<strong>you have a problem</strong>. But&nbsp;<strong>if you owe</strong>&nbsp;a million,&nbsp;<strong>it</strong>&nbsp;has.” – Big Daddy Keyne$</p>



<p>I think there are really 2 things you need to understand about WSB (And really this piece of internet culture in general). It’s 50% depression and 50% a Molotov cocktail. You either win and get out or you lose AND you’re sticking it to the man at the same time. Even if I go super long, ratchet up the leverage, and take a big bet and lose guess what?</p>



<p>Nothing.</p>



<p>Seriously nothing. Most of these people are in hopeless debt with no clear path out anyway. They declare bankruptcy and move on. They took the bet, rode the adrenaline rush, and they lost. The silver lining? The elites that hate them are stuck paying the bill. It’s really a win-win situation. The memes, the culture, all of it really stems from this attitude.</p>



<p>I think it’s honestly fascinating that people are finally starting to notice this sub-culture once it’s begun affecting the mainstream financial system. Maybe now that it’s hitting these folks where they live, hurting the only thing they care about, they’ll start thinking about why these people are acting out. Before anyone accuses me of being a socialist I have a startup that sells <a href="https://decibelads.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radio ads called Decibel</a>. I’m a died in the wool capitalist and I can plainly see these issues. That maybe if they felt they had more of a stake in the future, that wealth inequality wasn’t so bad, that they’ll never afford a home, etc. they wouldn’t feel the need to act out. That if they weren’t in such an unwinnable situation they wouldn’t feel the need to throw Molotov cocktails through the front window of the country and the global financial system.</p>



<p>I doubt it, but one can hope.</p>



<p>Until then this is going to get worse, not better.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><p><span>Retro computing platforms all feature some form of a keyboard. In the very early days of home computing, the keyboard differentiated the computers from each other. Later, as applications became more sophisticated, the mouse became the next significant input device to catch-on. Early 8-bit machines from Atari, Commodore, and even Apple all had a mouse interface. However, like other peripherals at the time, they were not compatible with each other. Today's retro computer enthusiast may have a hard time finding a functional mouse for their favorite platform. Sold by </span><a href="https://twitter.com/RetrohaxN" rel="nofollow">Retrohax</a><span>, the </span><a href="https://retrohax.net/the-mouster-project-is-here/" rel="nofollow">mouSTer is a universal modern USB-to-retro mouse adapter</a><span>.</span></p><blockquote>"It all started with an idea to create the most convenient modern USB mouse adapter for as many retro machines as possible."</blockquote><p>Early mice usually featured a DB9-interface, but that interface was not always compatible across platforms. A mouse designed for an Atari Falcon may not work on the Commodore 64. The mouSTer handles those translations. Additionally, it serves as the USB HID host needed to enable a modern mouse. Before mouSTer, retro-mouse adapters tended to favor the older PS/2-style mice. Few mice sold today still have that legacy protocol.</p><p>Retrohax says that nearly every modern mouse they've tested works with the adapter. Advanced features like RGB LEDs could technically be supported, but there is doubt that the retro computers supply enough current for those modern features. In terms of another limitation, there is not support for PC serial mice. Computers like a Commodore 64 expect a pair of analog signals from the mouse. Serial mice on the PC were RS-232 / digital devices.</p><figure></figure><p>MouSTer firmware updates happen via a USB flash drive. A couple of files on the drive allow mouSTer to reflash or reconfigure itself. Today mouse emulation modes default to Amiga, Atari ST, and game pad. The expectation is the adapter should work with Amiga 3000, the Atari XL/XE series, and the Commodore C64 and C128.</p><p><span>Getting a case for mouSTer has been an issue. Injection molding is not an option because it would cause the USB-connector to become filled with plastic. Retrohax has plans to release STL files so that users can 3d print a case. The first batch of 220 units is for sale on the </span><a href="https://retrohax.net/shop/amiga/mouster/" rel="nofollow">Retrohax web store</a><span>, with a plan to produce another batch based on demand. Currently, the price is 116 PLN Polish Zloty, which is about 31 USD.</span></p></div></section></div>]]>

            <p>Artificial Intelligence must be subject to human control, allowing humans to correct or disable it in case of unforeseen behaviour, say MEPs.</p>

            <div><p><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The report, adopted on Wednesday with 364 votes in favour, 274 against, 52 abstentions, calls for an EU legal framework on AI with definitions and ethical principles, including its military use. It also calls on the EU and its member states to ensure AI and related technologies are human-centred (i.e. intended for the service of humanity and the common good).</p>

<p><strong>Military use and human oversight</strong></p>

<p>MEPs stress that human dignity and human rights must be respected in all EU defence-related activities. AI-enabled systems must allow humans to exert meaningful control, so they can assume responsibility and accountability for their use.</p>
<p>The use of lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) raises fundamental ethical and legal questions on human control, say MEPs, <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-8-2018-0341_EN.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterating their call</a> for an EU strategy to prohibit them as well as a ban on so-called â€œkiller robotsâ€�. The decision to select a target and take lethal action using an autonomous weapon system must always be made by a human exercising meaningful control and judgement, in line with the principles of proportionality and necessity.</p>
<p>The text calls on the EU to take a leading role in creating and promoting a global framework governing the military use of AI, alongside the UN and the international community.</p>

<p><strong>AI in the public sector</strong></p>
<p>The increased use of AI systems in public services, especially healthcare and justice, should not replace human contact or lead to discrimination, MEPs assert. People should always be informed if they are subject to a decision based on AI and be given the option to appeal it.</p>
<p>When AI is used in matters of public health, (e.g. robot-assisted surgery, smart prostheses, predictive medicine), patientsâ€™ personal data must be protected and the principle of equal treatment upheld. While the use of AI technologies in the justice sector can help speed up proceedings and take more rational decisions, final court decisions must be taken by humans, be strictly verified by a person and be subject to due process.</p>

<p><strong>Mass surveillance and deepfakes </strong></p>
<p>MEPs also warn of threats to fundamental human rights and state sovereignty arising from the use of AI technologies in mass civil and military surveillance. They call for public authorities to be banned from using â€œhighly intrusive social scoring applicationsâ€� (for monitoring and rating citizens). The report also raises concerns over â€œdeepfake technologiesâ€� that have the potential to â€œdestabilise countries, spread disinformation and influence electionsâ€�. Creators should be obliged to label such material as â€œnot originalâ€� and more research should be done into technology to counter this phenomenon.</p>
<p><br><strong>Quote</strong></p>
<p>Rapporteur <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/124738/GILLES_LEBRETON/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gilles Lebreton (ID, FR)</a> said: â€œFaced with the multiple challenges posed by the development of AI, we need legal responses. To prepare the Commissionâ€™s legislative proposal on this subject, this report aims to put in place a framework which essentially recalls that, in any area, especially in the military field and in those managed by the state such as justice and health, AI must always remain a tool used only to assist decision-making or help when taking action. It must never replace or relieve humans of their responsibilityâ€�.</p>

<h6 id="h6183003">Update January 26. 2021: I received some feedback that people would be interested in more details of the reasons, why the React build process is so complicated, because, well, it is the title of this post. So, I added some more to the "Comparison and reasons" section and the "Conclusion"
    </h6>


    </div>
<p>Have you ever tried to share a freshly designed UI-component as a library? Recently, I was creating some <a href="https://gradientdescent.de/descent-ripple/">ripple-effect animations</a> in <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> and decided to publish them in a library. It is neatly compiled with all the runtime, so it can be used without Svelte. To target the large audience of React developers, I also wrote a convenient <a href="https://gradientdescent.de/react-descent-ripple/">React wrapper component</a> for it. At first, I thought this would be an easy task, but the build process turned out to be harder than I thought. So, I want to share my experience. I will show a simpler example here, so let' go:
    </p>
<h2 id="h2549518">The project
    </h2>

<p>Let's assume, we want to share a simple component, which wraps Html content into a
    </p>
<p>Rocket     
      </p>
<p>The rocket is just a div, which has the borders styled in an unusual way with simple css. It is just a toy example, but I want to do this with React and Svelte, so let's start with the basic steps in Svelte:
    </p>
<h3 id="h3325710">Svelte
    </h3>

<p>To start, create a folder <code><code>svelte-div-rocket</code></code> and in it run
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>npm init</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>and answer the questions to generate a package.json file. As <code><code>"main"</code></code> choose <code><code>"Rocket.svelte"</code></code> and then go ahead and create this file. For this example, I do not bother creating subfolders, for larger projects this would not be wise. Here is the content I put in the <code><code>"Rocket.svelte"</code></code>:
    </p>

<span><span>    </span><span>&lt;slot/&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/div&gt;</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>Let me explain: first, we have a comment bracket <code><code>&lt;!--... --&gt;</code></code> where the component is documented. Then there is the script, where we export a single prop <code><code>direction</code></code>. In the style element, we declare 4 CSS classes, one for each facing direction. And finally, the Html section has a div, where the class is picked based on the direction prop, and we got a slot so that we can add children into the rocket.
    </p>
<p>What else is to say about the component library? Not much, actually. We could add more information to the package.json, a README.md, and a license file, if we wanted to, or we could already publish this to npm. In a Svelte project, we can (after installation, obviously) use the component with
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>// Somecomponent.svelte</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;script&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    import Rocket  from 'svelte-div-rocket';</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/script&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;</span><span>Rocket</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    some text</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Rocket</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>That's it for Svelte.
    </p>
<h3 id="h3616801">React
    </h3>

<p>Let's try the same process. Create a folder <code><code>react-div-rocket</code></code>, run <code><code>npm init</code></code>, answer questions with <code><code>"main":"Rocket.jsx"</code></code>, create this file and put this in:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>// Rocket.jsx</span></span>
<span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>react</span><span>'</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>./rocket.css</span><span>'</span></span>

<span><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> (</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>&lt;div</span><span> </span><span>className</span><span>={</span></span>

<span><span>                (</span><span>direction</span><span> </span><span>===</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>down</span><span>"</span><span>) </span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>downlookingrocket</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>:</span></span>
<span><span>                    </span><span>direction</span><span> </span><span>===</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>right</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>rightlookingrocket</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>:</span></span>

<span><span>            </span><span>{</span><span>children</span><span>}</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>&lt;/div&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    )</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>

<span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>Rocket</span><span>;</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>Also, create a file <code><code>rocket.css</code></code> where the 4 classes from the Svelte style tag are placed. When I try to use it from a project started with <code><code>create-react-app</code></code> the following error appears:
    </p>
<blockquote><div><p>&gt;</p>
        <p>../react-div-rocket/rocket.jsx 8:8<br>
Module parse failed: Unexpected token (8:8)<br>
You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type, currently no loaders are configured to process this file. See <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">https://webpack.js.org</a>
    </p></div>
      
    </blockquote>
<p>It tells me, you can't have .jsx files in a library unless you have an extra webpack loader. The loader would have to be part of the app project, not the library, so it is no option to demand the users of our rocket library to install it. Instead, we have to transpile the jsx into plain js.
    </p>
<p>In this case, we could do this by hand or with the <a href="https://babeljs.io/repl/#?browsers=defaults%2C%20not%20ie%2011%2C%20not%20ie_mob%2011&amp;build=&amp;builtIns=false&amp;spec=false&amp;loose=false&amp;code_lz=GYVwdgxgLglg9mABACwKYBt1wBQEpEDeAUIogE6pQhlIA8AJjAG4B8AEhlogO5xnr0AhLQD0jVgG4iAXyJA&amp;debug=false&amp;forceAllTransforms=false&amp;shippedProposals=false&amp;circleciRepo=&amp;evaluate=false&amp;fileSize=false&amp;timeTravel=false&amp;sourceType=module&amp;lineWrap=true&amp;presets=react&amp;prettier=false&amp;targets=&amp;version=7.12.12&amp;externalPlugins=">Babel online transpiler</a>, since we just need to arrive here:

<span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>Rocket</span><span>;</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>In general, this is a tedious process, so let's start over and try a streamlined version.
First, delete the package.json. Then run
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>npx create-react-library</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>and answer all the questions. Depending on your computer and internet connection speed, you'll have time to grab some coffee. Small recap, the ready-to-use Svelte library has 2 files and uses <strong>~2 kB
    </strong> disk space, and has zero dependencies. To be fair, it does not have a test environment, an example app, or TypeScript linting and transpiling. The React folder has all that now. It takes about <strong>397 MB
    </strong> (<strong>420 MB
    </strong> with TypeScript template) of disk space and the node_modules folder has <strong>1087
    </strong> (<strong>1096
    </strong> with TypeScript) subfolders. It has no "normal" dependencies, but <strong>19
    </strong> dev-dependencies (<strong>29
    </strong> with TypeScript) and 1 peer-dependency (react).
    </p>
<p>It should be easy enough to adjust the template with our rocket component. Or is it not? Copy over the <code><code>Rocket.jsx</code></code> code to src/index.js, copy <code><code>rocket.css</code></code> into the src folder and build the library with the <code><code>npm run build</code></code> command. Then import the component into some app. And et voilà, nothing happens. Well, at least if the React version of the library and your project matches. If not, you get an error.
    </p>
<blockquote><div><p>&gt;</p>
        <p>Quick fix: update both React versions or simply delete the React folder in the node_modules folder in our rocket library.
    </p></div>
      
    </blockquote>
<p>Assuming that there are no more errors, why are we not seeing any rockets? First, note that our CSS classes end up in <code><code>dist/index.css</code></code> but they are renamed during the build process. If we want to style something with our class 'uplookingrocket', we would need to write something like this:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>styles</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>./rocket.css</span><span>'</span><span>;</span></span>

<span><span>&lt;p</span><span> </span><span>className</span><span>={</span><span>styles</span><span>[</span><span>"</span><span>uplookingrocket</span><span>"</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>Adjust our code accordingly aaaand..... still nothing. You can find the reason by looking into the <code><code>Example/App.js</code></code>. There is the following line:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>react-div-rocket/dist/index.css</span><span>'</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>That means, in the app, we have to import the component <strong>and
    </strong> the CSS file. Maybe that makes sense from a technical perspective since React/Webpack wants to bundle CSS into a single file, but from a user perspective, this is rather inconvenient. For our little project, it even questions, whether it makes sense at all. The "magic" happens in CSS, so we could only publish the CSS file in a library and let the user apply it to her Html elements.
    </p>
<h2 id="h295798">Comparison and reasons
    </h2>

<p>Both libraries work, at last. When you only look at the final results which are delivered to the consumer, <code><code>dist/index.js</code></code> and <code><code>dist/index.css</code></code> for React and <code><code>Rocket.svelte</code></code> for Svelte, there is no big difference in size and content. Why is the process to get there so different?<br>
React is much older than Svelte. It has a long history and along the way, it redefined itself and with it the way we look at web apps. The most popular way today is probably to create a bundled app with  <code><code>create-react-app</code></code>. It was not always clear that this would be the preferred operation mode by developers. It is also possible to run React completely from CDNs. This has the advantage that the React library is downloaded only once for all pages. This option explains why our library cannot contain jsx files: we can't know if the library is processed further or if it is directly called in the browser, and the browser does not understand jsx.
    </p>
<p>The Svelte developers on the other side could observe how the landscape of web development changed over time. Developers today transpile and bundle their apps anyway, so why not try to put the heavy lifting into the compile step? So, Svelte is a compiler. It does not have a heavy legacy backpack to carry around (yet?). It gathers all information when the final code is generated. Thus, we don't need to pre-process our library. Svelte condenses a lot that is good in React, but of course, it is much more. It has its own syntax and file type, it gets rid of the <code><code>virtual DOM</code></code> and instead <code><code>redefines reactivity</code></code>, and adds a lot of little helper gimmicks that make the life of a developer much easier.
    </p>
<p>Perhaps React shows the way, that Svelte might also go one day: Commit after commit new Ideas are added and more and more use-cases are covered. At the same time, the codebase grows, and complexity increases. Cutting back in features or supported …</p></div></div>

<p>Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral Space Port Sation, Florida — SpaceX made history again by sending a record number of 143 satellites on a single mission to the lower Earth orbit yesterday. The record was previously held by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) with 103 satellites on a single launch.</p>



<p>Among these were 10 SpaceX Starlink satellites that are deployed to the Polar Orbit (see animation below for explanation). This will make high-speed internet available in the most remote polar locations of our planet.</p>



<p>The SmallSat rideshare program by SpaceX enables customers in launching their satellites to low Earth orbit (LEO) with a budget as low as $1M. In this dedicated launch, most of the small satellites were of SpaceX customers, in the past, SpaceX has been making space for a small number of customer satellites with the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/06/14/falcon-9-starlink-launch-58/">Starlink constellation satellites.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a>‘s space exploration &amp; commercial spaceflight company has used optical laser-linking of the satellites for the first time. Musk has confirmed on Twitter that the black pipe-type objects at the end of each Starlink satellite are actually laser links. I have marked these objects in the following photo of the SmallSat satellite stack photo shared by SpaceX before the launch.</p>

<p>According to Musk, only the polar <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/starlink/">Starlink</a> satellites sent to orbit this year will have laser links, all the other Starlink satellites will get laser-linking feature next year. SpaceX has given the current laser-linked satellites a version number of v0.9, Musk explained.</p>

<h2>Why Laser Links?</h2>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=snoshy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">u/snoshy</a> provided much-needed insight on the use of ‘laser links’ on Starlink satellites as the article made it to the HN front page.</p>



<blockquote><p>These laser links are purely intended for satellite-to-satellite communications for Starlink. They are not (at least at this time, and for the foreseeable future) intended for ground-to-satellite communications.</p><p>The value that sat-to-sat laser links provide is that they create a low latency, high bandwidth path that stays within the Starlink satellite network. Before these 10 satellites, each Starlink satellite has only been capable of communicating directly to ground terminals (either consumer, transit or SpaceX control). For traffic that is intended to move large geographic distances (think transcontinental), this can require several hops back and forth between ground and space, or the traffic from the user terminal is exited at a node that is geared for transiting traffic and most of the data transits along with existing ground Internet links.</p><p>By performing this type of transit directly in space, and exiting at a transit node nearest the destination for the data, you greatly reduce latency. Bandwidth still might not be great, but what this does is unlocks a very financially lucrative consumer use case: low latency finance traffic and critical communications. </p><p>There are many use cases around the world where shaving even 10-20 milliseconds of latency on a data path can unlock finance and emergency capabilities, and this is a long-fought battle throughout the history of these industries. As an example, if you got a piece of news about a company in Australia, and wanted to trade on it as quickly as possible in the USA if you can beat your competitors by 10-20 milliseconds, that can mean a lot of money.</p><p>Laser comms for Starlink sats have long been planned, but have historically proven to be quite hard to get working. They also depend on a sufficient critical mass of satellites so that a given satellite actually does have another satellite within the lock to send the traffic towards.</p><cite>u/snoshy via <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25906513" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hacker News discussion</a>.</cite></blockquote>

<p>Later on, the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket successfully landed on the Of Course I Still Love You drone ship. <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/spacex/">SpaceX</a> posted the landing video on the company’s official Twitter account — still mesmerizes.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="single-content-content"><p>There’s plenty of research on the impact fast food has on your health. For example:</p><p>"Today, eating processed foods and fast foods may kill more people prematurely than cigarette smoking."<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6146358/">The hidden dangers of fast and processed food</a>, American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine, Joel Fuhrman, MD.</p><p>"Just a few days of junk food could change your metabolism. A small <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.21031/abstract">study</a> of 12 healthy young men found eating junk food for just five days led to a reduced ability of their muscles to turn glucose into energy, even though they didn’t eat more calories as part of the study. Over the long term, this change could lead to insulin resistance and eventually type 2 diabetes."</p><p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/sneaking-a-little-junk-food-doesnt-mean-all-is-lost/2018/02/26/828b75fa-1b36-11e8-9de1-147dd2df3829_story.html">This is your body on fast food</a>, Washington Post</p><p>But we’ve never seen how fast food impacts the body in real-time, over 5 days. We decided to put it to the test with another N of 1 experiment (i.e. not a statistically significant sample size but interesting to do nonetheless).</p><p>Before we get into the data, some key metrics that Basis tracks and for you to follow along:</p><p><b>Fasting glucose:</b> This is the glucose test you're likely most familiar with. It's the test you do in the morning, after you've fasted for 8-10 hours. The normal range for blood glucose is 70 to 100 mg/dl (but values may vary for different labs). Levels between 100 and 126 mg/dl are referred to as impaired fasting glucose or pre-diabetes<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm"></a>. Diabetes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm"></a>is typically diagnosed when fasting blood glucose levels are 126 mg/dl or higher. Basis acquires its data from a glucose sensor that measures glucose in the interstitial fluid - not in serum (blood). Measurements can vary up to 10-15% between the results you would get in a lab.</p><p><b>Time in range:</b> Minimizing the number of glucose spikes and more time spent in the optimal glucose range of 70-110 is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31127824">observed in healthy (non-diabetic) adults</a>. </p><p><b>Glucose variability:</b> Glucose variability is the amount of variation that you experience with your glucose throughout the day. Maintaining steadier glucose variation over time <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4543190/#:~:text=Glycemic%20variability%20(GV)%2C%20which,same%20time%20on%20different%20days.">leads to better health outcomes</a>. In healthy, non-diabetic adults, glucose variability targets are &lt;13%.</p><p><b>Heart rate variability (HRV): </b>HRV measures the beat-to-beat variations of your heart rate throughout the day. HRV provides insights into how your heartbeats change over time and is now a crucial measure of overall well-being and physical fitness.</p><p><b>Disclaimer:</b> We don’t recommend that anyone try eating fast food with every meal for a week. If you’re already doing it, we hope this post can have even the slightest of impact in helping you transition towards eating healthier. </p><p><b>Day 1</b></p><p>Loading Chart</p><p><u>Glucose</u></p><p>Low: 85 / Average: 102 / High: 144</p><p>Fasting glucose: 88</p><p>Time in range: 85.5%</p><p>Glucose variability: 13.12</p><p><u>Heart rate</u></p><p>Low: 49 / Average: 99 / High: 174</p><p>HRV: 36.69</p><p><u>Meals</u></p><p><i>Breakfast: </i>Starbucks coffee w/ milk and sugar + butter croissant.</p><p><i>Lunch:</i> Cheeseburger with fries and a beer.</p><p><i>Snacks: Cookies.</i></p><p><i>Dinner:</i> Pizza and a Coke.</p><p><b>Day 2</b></p><p>Loading Chart</p><p><u>Glucose</u></p><p>Low: 76 / Average: 103 / High: 142</p><p>Fasting glucose: 88</p><p>Time in range: 71%</p><p>Glucose variability: 11.82</p><p><u>Heart rate</u></p><p>Low: 51 / Average: 73 / High: 113</p><p>HRV: 17.66</p><p><i>Breakfast: </i>Starbucks coffee w/ milk and sugar + a chocolate croissant.</p><p><i>Lunch:</i> KFC nuggets w/ fries and a Coke.</p><p><i>Snacks:</i> Cookies.</p><p><i>Dinner: C</i>hicken in sweet sauce with fries and a 7up. </p><p><b>Day 3</b></p><p>Loading Chart</p><p>This was the worst day of the week.

But now we have real-time data to confirm just how drastic that change can be. </p><p><b>Other observations:</b></p><ol><li><p>It's hard to glean too much from the heart rate data, but overall I felt tired and slow. My HRV was generally lower than normal, dropping from an average of ~35 to ~25.</p></li><li><p>My subjective well-being went down. I felt overall sluggish and unable to concentrate. And the reason is that every single fast food meal can narrow your arteries, leading to an increase in blood pressure. The quick spike in blood sugar can cause a surge in insulin, and then a quick drop in blood sugar. That leaves you feeling tired, cranky and hungry for more.  </p></li><li><p>Anecdotally, we heard from a number of people that this is the normal way they eat. If anything from my experience extrapolates to the average population, then there's no questioning why we have a diabetic epidemic. </p></li></ol><p>If you’re interested in seeing real-time data from a 3-day fast, check it out <a href="https://basishealth.io/blog/real-time-fasting-data-with-basis/">HERE</a>.</p><br><h3><b>Looking for a clearer view of your health?</b></h3><p><a href="https://basishealth.typeform.com/to/PVvE3guR">Sign up</a> for the Basis Early Access Beta and discover what having real-time access to your health data means. </p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Page speed and UX</strong> will be important forces that will take brands a few steps ahead in the digital race of 2021. So where exactly will you be in this race?</p><p>Powerful tasks offered by Screpy experts and comprehensive analysis reporting from a single point will enable you to track the speed of more projects in a more practical way. We will talk about the contribution of all these to SEO exactly now. Ready to get started?</p><h2>User Experience and Page Speed: You Are What You Offer!</h2><p>UX refers to the experience of a user who enters your website, depending on all factors, from colors, buttons, font to the general theme, content to site speed. Page speed determines how quickly users can access the content they request.</p><p>Now consider the web of the Internet where millions of different pages are ranked for each keyword. How likely are you to give a chance more than once to a site that loads very slowly or responds very slowly to your interactions?</p><p><em>Let’s say: not much</em>. Because there are websites with extremely rich content that will give you a perfect web experience by paying attention to UX on the internet. Moreover, this competition is valid for almost every sector.</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, web speed does not only affect e-commerce sites. Since e-commerce sites directly analyze behaviors such as adding a product to the chart or purchasing an item, the speed optimization of these sites is extremely valuable. However, the user who cannot get around through the categories even on a standard blog site becomes the user who will add +1 digits to the bounce rate tab in a short time.</p><p><strong><em>What does bounce rate mean</em>?</strong> Bounce rate refers to the rate of ‘’abandoning the website’’ of the user just before he or she enters it. As you can imagine, a website that is difficult to load or navigate between pages means a website with an increased bounce rate. So even if the traffic is high in the first process, low UX and low conversion negatively affect traffic and SEO over time.<br></p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="944" height="483" src="https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/speed-index.png.webp" alt="Speed Index" srcset="https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/speed-index.png.webp 944w,  https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/speed-index-300x153.png.webp 300w,  https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/speed-index-768x393.png.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 944px) 100vw, 944px"></figure><h3>Page Speed Manages Brand Perception: Other Side of UX</h3><p>User Experience also includes how a user feels about your brand’s product or service.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember that a YSL user feels special and an Adidas user feels modern and powerful, right? That is what we called brand psychology. The values you attribute to your brand will also affect the experience your customers get from the brands’ products.</p><p><strong><em>Let’s meet a fact:&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p>A fast web page also affects your brand prestige in the eyes of the user. According to a study, especially when e-commerce site users experience situations such as freezing, crashing, taking too long to load, they prefer not to make a purchase from that site. Because this negative experience leaves the users an impression that the website they are on is not professional and competent enough.</p><p>Did that seem too striking to you? The bottom line is that this doesn’t just apply to buying behavior. Unless you support the user’s experience on your website with strong page speed rates, you will forgo the professional appearance of your platform.&nbsp;</p><p>After all, which professional platform would be too careless to take the necessary measures for page speed?</p><h3>There Is More To Talk About: Organic Search Rankings and Page Speed</h3><p>Now, we now know very well that page speed is in constant interaction with the following concepts:</p><ol><li>User experience</li><li>Bounce rate</li><li>SEO (Search engine optimization)</li><li>Purchasing behavior</li><li>Conversion rates</li><li>Organic traffic</li></ol><p>What about organic search engine rankings? Imagine trying to boost your website’s SERP rankings by doing search engine optimization. Better rankings will mean the following:</p><ul><li>Getting more visibility with less need for extra SEM budget,</li><li>To increase traffic organically,</li><li>Increasing brand recognition,</li><li>Increasing sales rates.</li></ul><p><strong><em>So, how does all this relate to SEO?</em></strong></p><p>Google cares that the websites it offers for its users are platforms with high performance and powerful UX. That’s why Google Pagespeed tries to predict the performance of websites using various metrics that measure speed.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="943" height="421" src="https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/performance-report.png.webp" alt="Google Pagespeed Performance Metrics" srcset="https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/performance-report.png.webp 943w,  https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/performance-report-300x134.png.webp 300w,  https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/performance-report-768x343.png.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 943px) 100vw, 943px"><figcaption>Performance Insights</figcaption></figure><p>Would you like to take a look at how many seconds of page loading speed performances together create a theoretical UX?

The user gets the chance to create a real interaction on such sites and gets the responses of the requested functions from the site very quickly.</li><li><strong>1 second</strong>: User experience will have a slightly lower score than the previous option.

Especially if this waiting takes place without any feedback, the brand image and user experience are damaged at the same time.</li></ul><h2>What About Visitor Behavior: UX, SEO, Conversion Rates</h2><p>How can the speed a user encounters when visiting a website somehow affect their SEO score?

This experience causes judgments to be made about the brand’s reputation and easily finding what they are looking for. When these judgments arise, the user organizes subsequent website behavior. Also, page speed performance is an important metric that is evaluated directly within Google Insights, according to Google’s official statements.</p><h3>How is user experience is affected by page speed and how does it affect SEO?</h3><p>User experience varies depending on the page speed performance. A low performance means low UX. Low UX generates the user’s request to leave the site. This means that the bounce rate increases. A website with a high bounce rate will have a low SEO score.</p><h3>How is SEO affected by user experience and page speed?&nbsp;</h3><p>Low SEO score can be caused by low page speed values ​​or low UX scores. This prevents the web page from reaching high rankings in organic search result pages. This makes it difficult to attract user traffic to the website.

<p>I spent this week debug­ging an issue with an inter­nal web tool that our company’s sup­port team relies upon to pull up infor­ma­tion about our cus­tomers, mak­ing changes on their behalf to their sub­scrip­tions of the var­i­ous pack­ages and ser­vices that we offer. Try­ing to view one par­tic­u­lar cus­tomer — one! — would always crash the appli­ca­tion, leav­ing an unhelp­ful mes­sage that said, “Inter­nal Serv­er Error: Please con­tact the serv­er admin­is­tra­tor. More infor­ma­tion about this error may be avail­able in the serv­er error log.” Unfor­tu­nate­ly, there was only a sin­gle line in the log, “Error 500,” which only indi­cat­ed that yes, an error had hap­pened on the serv­er. No details from the application.</p>



<p>Luck­i­ly, this appli­ca­tion was writ­ten in Perl, an expres­sive pro­gram­ming lan­guage with a rich ecosys­tem of open-source libraries. It also has a built-in debug­ger mode that can run your pro­gram step by step, line by line. Any pro­gram that can be run from the text com­mand line can be paused, have its vari­ables and objects exam­ined, new code inter­ac­tive­ly entered, and then con­tin­ue its exe­cu­tion as if noth­ing had happened.</p>



<p>How­ev­er, this was a web appli­ca­tion that assumed it was run­ning in a web serv­er envi­ron­ment, and the customer’s infor­ma­tion was in our pro­duc­tion data­base, safe from pry­ing eyes (includ­ing curi­ous devel­op­ers like me) due to finan­cial com­pli­ance rules. I could not sim­ply run this pro­gram on my desk­top and repro­duce the prob­lem with this one cus­tomer — I had to some­how tease out more infor­ma­tion from a run­ning sys­tem and report it back using the only tool avail­able: the serv­er error log men­tioned above.</p>



<p>But still, the Perl debug­ger approach was appeal­ing. Could I some­how get the appli­ca­tion to log each line of code as it was exe­cut­ed? Could I then see what was run­ning the moment before it crashed, the offend­ing line print­ed in the log like a smok­ing gun that had just mur­dered its vic­tim? And assum­ing that the prob­lem was in our code and not in the mil­lions of lines of third-par­ty code it depend­ed upon, could I fil­ter out all the&nbsp;noise?</p>



<p>The answer, thank­ful­ly, was yes; since the debug­ger itself is writ­ten in Perl and designed to be extend­ed or replaced, I could add code at the begin­ning of our appli­ca­tion that inter­cept­ed each line as it was run, throw out any­thing that came from a file out­side of our application’s direc­to­ry fold­er, and then report the rest (along with help­ful line num­bers) to the error log. Then turn on the “debug” switch on the web serv­er run­ning the appli­ca­tion, and voilà, the log would duti­ful­ly fill up with (slow­er, more mem­o­ry-con­sum­ing) code report­ed by the debugger.</p>



<p>We set up our stag­ing serv­er to use the branch of code with debug­ging enabled, and then instruct­ed the appli­ca­tion to dis­play the prob­lem­at­ic cus­tomer’s records. As expect­ed, the error log imme­di­ate­ly began fill­ing up with line after line of our application’s code and then bang, crashed right after issu­ing a par­tic­u­lar data­base query for ser­vices tied to the account. I had my smok­ing gun! After extract­ing the query and run­ning it on a redact­ed copy of our data­base, I found that it was return­ing some 1.9 mil­lion rows of data as it retrieved pro­vi­sion­ing, billing, and renew­al his­to­ry for every ser­vice owned by the cus­tomer. This was far too many than nec­es­sary — the appli­ca­tion only cares about cur­rent sta­tus, and it was run­ning out of mem­o­ry as it cre­at­ed ser­vice objects for each&nbsp;row.</p>



<p>The data­base expert on my team was able to adjust the query to return only cur­rent infor­ma­tion, and after a quick test on the redact­ed data­base, the change is now wait­ing for qual­i­ty assur­ance test­ing before launch­ing to our pro­duc­tion servers. The debug­ging code branch will be saved until it’s need­ed again, and our team was once again grate­ful that we were work­ing in such a pow­er­ful pro­gram­ming lan­guage as&nbsp;Perl.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>Nine months ago, we embarked on a format migration for the persistent
(on-disk) representation of variable-length strings like symbolicated
call stacks in the <a href="https://www.backtrace.io/">Backtrace</a> server. We
chose a variant of
<a href="http://www.stuartcheshire.org/papers/COBSforToN.pdf">consistent overhead byte stuffing (COBS)</a>,
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-synchronizing_code">self-synchronising code</a>,
for the metadata (variable-length as well).
This choice let us improve our software’s resilience to data
corruption in local files, and then parallelise data hydration, which
improved startup times by a factor of 10… without any hard
migration from the old to the current on-disk data format.</p><p>In this post, I will explain why I believe that the representation of
first resort for binary logs (write-ahead, recovery, replay, or
anything else that may be consumed by a program) should be
self-synchronising, backed by this migration and by prior experience
with COBS-style encoding. I will also describe the
<a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/stuffed-record-stream">specific algorithm (available under the MIT license)</a>
we implemented for our server software.</p><p>This encoding offers low space overhead for framing, fast encoding and
faster decoding, resilience to data corruption, and a restricted form
of random access. Maybe it makes sense to use it for your own data!</p><h2 id="what-is-self-synchronisation-and-why-is-it-important">What is self-synchronisation, and why is it important?</h2><p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-synchronizing_code">code is self-synchronising</a>
when it’s always possible to unambiguously detect where a valid code
word (record) starts in a stream of symbols (bytes). That’s a
stronger property than prefix codes like Huffman codes, which only
detect when valid code words end. For example, the UTF-8
encoding is self-synchronising, because initial bytes and continuation
bytes differ in their high bits. That’s why it’s possible to decode
multi-byte code points when tailing a UTF-8 stream.</p><p>The UTF-8 code was designed for small integers (Unicode code points),
and can double the size of binary data. Other encodings are more
appropriate for arbitrary bytes; for example,
<a href="http://www.stuartcheshire.org/papers/COBSforToN.pdf">consistent overhead byte stuffing (COBS)</a>,
a self-synchronising code for byte streams, offers a worst-case
space overhead of one byte plus a 0.4% space blow-up.</p><p>Self-synchronisation is important for binary logs because it lets us
efficiently (with respect to both run time and space overhead) frame
records in a simple and robust manner… and we want simplicity and
robustness because logs are most useful when something has gone wrong.</p><p>Of course, the storage layer should detect and correct errors, but
things will sometimes fall through, especially for on-premises
software, where no one fully controls deployments. When that happens,
graceful partial failure is preferable to, e.g., losing all the
information in a file because one of its pages went to the great bit
bucket in the sky.</p><p>One easy solution is to spread the data out over multiple files or
blobs. However, there’s a trade-off between keeping data
fragmentation and file metadata overhead in check, and minimising the
blast radius of minor corruption. Our server must be able to run
on isolated nodes, so we can’t rely on design options available to
replicated systems… plus bugs tend to be correlated across replicas,
so there is something to be said for defense in depth, even with
distributed storage.</p><p>When each record is converted with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-synchronizing_code">self-synchronising code</a>
like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_Overhead_Byte_Stuffing">COBS</a>
before persisting to disk, we can decode all records that weren’t
directly impacted by corruption, exactly like decoding a stream of
mostly valid UTF-8 bytes. Any form of corruption will only make
us lose the records whose bytes were corrupted, and, at most, the two records
that immediately precede or follow the corrupt byte range. This
guarantee covers overwritten data (e.g., when a network switch flips a
bit, or a read syscall silently errors out with a zero-filled page),
as well as bytes removed or garbage inserted in the middle of log
files.</p><p>The coding doesn’t store redundant information: replication or erasure
coding is the storage layer’s responsibility. It instead guarantees
to <em>always</em> minimise the impact of corruption, and only lose records
that were adjacent to or directly hit by corruption.</p><p>A COBS encoding for log records achieves that by unambiguously
separating records with a reserved byte (e.g., 0), and re-encoding
each record to avoid that separator byte. A reader can thus assume
that potential records start and end at a log file’s first and last
bytes, and otherwise look for separator bytes to determine where to
cut all potential records. These records may be invalid: a
separator byte could be introduced or removed by corruption, and the
contents of a correctly framed record may be corrupt. When
that happens, readers can simply scan for the next separator byte and
try to validate that new potential record. The decoder’s state resets
after each separator byte, so any corruption is “forgotten” as soon as
the decoder finds valid a separator byte.</p><p>On the write side, the encoding logic is simple (a couple dozen lines
of C code), and uses a predictable amount of space, as expected from
an algorithm suitable for microcontrollers.</p><p>Actually writing encoded data is also easy:
on POSIX filesystems, we can make sure each record is delimited (e.g.,
prefixed with the delimiter byte), and issue a
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904875/functions/write.html">regular <code>O_APPEND</code> write(2)</a>.
Vectored writes can even insert delimiters without copying in
userspace. Realistically, our code is probably less stable than
operating system and the hardware it runs on, so we make sure our
writes make it to the kernel as soon as possible, and let <code>fsync</code>s
happen on a timer.</p><p>When a write errors out, we can blindly (maybe once or twice) try
again: the encoding is independent of the output file’s state. When a
write is cut short, we can still issue the same<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> write call,
without trying to “fix” the short write: the encoding and the
read-side logic already protect against that kind of corruption.</p><p>What if multiple threads or processes write to the same log file?
When we <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904875/functions/open.html">open with <code>O_APPEND</code></a>,
the operating system can handle the rest. This doesn’t make
contention disappear, but at least we’re not adding a bottleneck in
userspace on top of what is necessary to append to the same file.
Buffering is also trivial: the encoding is independent of the state of
the destination file, so we can always concatenate buffered records
and write the result with a single syscall.</p><p>This simplicity also plays well with
<a href="https://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf">high-throughput I/O primitives like <code>io_uring</code></a>, and with
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/append-block">blob stores that support appends</a>:
independent workers can concurrently queue up blind append requests and
retry on failure.
There’s no need for application-level mutual exclusion or rollback.</p><h2 id="fun-tricks-with-robust-readers">Fun tricks with robust readers</h2><p>Our log encoding will recover from bad bytes, as long as readers can
detect and reject invalid records as a whole; the processing logic
should also handle duplicated valid records. These are table stakes
for a reliable log consumer.</p><p>In our variable-length metadata use case, each record describes a
symbolicated call stack, and we recreate in-memory data structures by
replaying an append-only log of metadata records, one for each
unique call stack. The hydration phase handles invalid records by
ignoring (not recreating) any call stack with corrupt metadata,
but only those call stacks. That’s definitely an improvement over the
previous situation, where corruption in a size header would prevent us
from decoding the remainder of the file, and thus make us forget about
<em>all</em> call stacks stored at file offsets after the corruption.</p><p>Of course, losing data should be avoided, so we are careful to
<code>fsync</code> regularly and recommend reasonable storage configurations.
However, one can only make data loss unlikely, not impossible (if only
due to fat fingering), especially when cost is a factor. With the COBS
encoding, we can recover gracefully and automatically from any
unfortunate data corruption event.</p><p>We can also turn this robustness into new capabilities.</p><p>It’s often useful to process the tail of a log at a regular cadence.
For example, I once maintained a system that regularly tailed hourly
logs to update approximate views. One could support that use case with
length footers. COBS framing lets us instead scan
for a valid record from an arbitrary byte location, and read the rest
of the data normally.</p><p>When logs grow large enough, we want to process them in parallel. The
standard solution is to shard log streams, which unfortunately couples
the parallelisation and storage strategies, and adds complexity to the
write side.</p><p>COBS framing lets us parallelise readers independently of the writer.
The downside is that the read-side code and I/O patterns are now more
complex, but, all other things being equal, that’s a trade-off I’ll
gladly accept, especially given that our servers run on independent
machines and store their data in files, where reads are fine-grained
and latency relatively low.</p><p>A parallel COBS reader partitions a data file arbitrarily (e.g., in
fixed size chunks) for independent workers. A worker will scan for
the first valid record starting inside its assigned chunk, and handle
every record that <em>starts</em> in its chunk. Filtering on the start byte
means that a worker may read past the logical end of its chunk, when
it fully decodes the last record that starts in the chunk: that’s how
we unambiguously assign a worker to every record, including records
that straddle chunk boundaries.</p><p>Random access even lets us implement a form of binary or interpolation
search on raw unindexed logs, when we know the records are (k-)sorted
on the search key! This lets us, e.g., access the metadata for a few
call stacks without parsing the whole log.</p><p>Eventually, we might also want to truncate our logs.</p><p>Contemporary filesystems like XFS (and even Ext4) support large sparse
files. For example, sparse files can reach \(2^{63} - 1\) bytes on
XFS with a minimal metadata-only footprint: the on-disk data for such
sparse files is only allocated when we issue actual writes. Nowadays,
we can <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/415889/">sparsify files after the fact</a>,
and convert ranges of non-zero data into zero-filled “holes” in order
to release storage without messing with file …</p></div></article></div></div>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>After the first lock-down ended and the children were packed off back to their incubation pods at school, life got tolerably quiet and I was able to worry about more minor auditory annoyances in life. The cupula above our hallway has an airgap for some reason, and it lets in the dull hubbub of the primary school playground next door. I spent an uncomfortable weekend up a ladder, filling the gaps with a noise insulating expanding foam.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Despite this, I gradually started to wonder if Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) headphones of some sort might be a good answer for working from this new space.</p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In December 2020, Apple announced the <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-max/">Airpods Max</a> and reviewers started waxing lyrical about how amazing these (extremely expensive) new ANC headphones from Apple truly were. As an Apple-eco-system stalwart, I considered that if I was going to spend <em>hundreds</em> of pounds on a pair of great ANC headphones, it might as well be <em>a couple more hundreds</em> of pounds for an <em>Apple</em> pair of headphones that would a) give the best performance and b) "just work" with all my Apple kit. As threats of a second school lock-down came to fruition I bit the bullet and ordered a pair.</p><h2 id="my-requirements">My requirements</h2><p>At this point its worth stating what I was <em>hoping</em> for from the Airpods Max, in priority order:</p><ol><li>Headphone noise cancellation that would cut out the noise of the house and it's occupants coming to my ears</li><li>Microphone voice isolation that would cut out the noise of the house and it's occupants reaching the ears of participants on video calls</li><li>Good-to-great sound quality of my voice on video calls</li><li>Great sound quality for listening to music while working</li></ol><h2 id="most-of-what-has-been-written-about-the-airpods-max-is-true">Most of what has been written about the Airpods Max is true</h2><p>The headphones arrived the second full week of January, a week before my wife and I had to start home-schooling the kids again but a time when both of us were back juggling full-time jobs with minding our 6, 8 and 10 year olds, plus the 10 month old puppy. </p><p>I'm not going to say much about the good bits of the Airpods Max because plenty has already been written on that. They do sound really great for music and for films. The most noticable thing to me was the way they project the sound in front of me when I'm listening to a normal stereo video on Youtube/Twitter/TikTok etc on the iPhone. It comes across as a very definite sound projection of about 30cms. I wouldn't say I like it especially more, but it's definitely a thing.</p><p>The ANC is exceptionally good at cutting out background noise. It fades it when you turn it on and I love the effect - it brings to mind a sound <em>animation</em>. I have subsequently tried a pair of Bose NC 700s and I can categorically say that the ANC on the Airpods Max is more effective at cutting out the normal background noise in my house.</p><p>However, as implied by the title, this isn't an article with a happy ending. In the end I had to send the Airpods Max back to Apple for a refund because they were four things that just did not work out for my use case. Without further ado, here they are...</p><h2 id="the-noise-cancellation-sucked">The noise cancellation sucked</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Let's tak about that ANC again. The use of 'sucked' in the title isn't (just) click-bait. The very first thing I noticed about the Airpods Max was that the ANC didn't feel great in my ears. I'd describe it as like the feeling you have when you need to repressurise your ears on an airplane. It doesn't bother you particularly at the time but when you swallow you realise it feels better. Taking off the Airpods Max felt like returning my inner ears to their natural, unadorned state. When I posted this on Twitter, @madmax helpfully pointed me to <a href="https://www.soundstagesolo.com/index.php/features/178-eardrum-suck-the-mystery-solved">an article</a> about <em>Eardrum Suck</em><sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> which I'm inclined to believe is the issue here. The ANC effect is very good at filtering out background noise, but it definitely <em>feels</em> like an effect.</p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>And then there is event noise. Event noise is what I'm calling any sudden loud noise that is over and above the normal background din. In my environment that is raised voices, dog barks, footsteps on the wooden floor, metallic noises from the kitchen and the previously described <em>ka-thunk</em> of closing doors. The ANC on the Airpods Max does not do well with any of these. To be fair it is a tough challenge. But what I was not expecting, what blew me away<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> was that low frequency event noise (e.g. a <em>ka-thunk</em> of a door) could actually create an uncomfortable ANC burp right into my ear drum. Like a Q-tip that's gone too deep. It's not pleasant and it happens every 10 minutes in my house. Imagine that - a Q-tip to the ear drum every 10 minutes! It doesn't take much of that to make a man want to take his headphones off his irreplaceable ear drums, no matter how expensive they were!</p>

It will negotiate a two-way SCO connection that reduces the audio quality for both the input and the output device. Yes that's right. If the microphone is active, everything sounds worse too. How much worse? Well I'm glad you asked. My desktop Mac<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> uses a Bluetooth 4.0 chipset. When the Airpods Max connect to a Bluetooth 4.0 chipset you end up with 8kHz audio. You can search the internet for this - it also happens for the regular Airpods and Airpods Pro. If you've been on a Zoom call with someone using Airpods that sounded like they are on the world's worst telephone - this is probably the reason. It can support 48kHz streaming audio simplex but only 8kHz duplex. I'm not a Bluetooth engineer but something doesn't add up here.</p>

But we are still getting a sub-par audio experience if the microphones are in use. The standard response from pretty much <em>everyone</em> on the internet is to turn off the device as an input source and use the internal microphone on your machine. They even have complicated instructions on how to fool the Mac into doing this automatically and one of the most popular apps for Airpods management <a href="https://c-command.com/toothfairy/">ToothFairy</a> has the ability to force this built-in. </p><p>Hell no.</p><p>I did not spend all this money on headphones with noise-isolating microphones just to <em>turn it off</em>.</p><p>On my iPhone 11 Pro things are better still.

I'm not sure if this is a Bluetooth 5.0 bandwidth capability or something else. But suffice to say that if you are getting 24kHz duplex then you can probably stop worrying about wireless quality problems. I wish I had a modern Mac with Bluetooth 5 built in to verify that the same is acheiveable on a modern chipset Mac. I'd be willing to believe so and it leaves me confident that Apple are <em>never</em> going to invest the time in making this better for older hardware.

<p>#Davos2021 starts today.</p>
<p>We’ve all been hearing a lot The Great Reset lately, new slogans abound such as Build Back Better, the New Normal, and what seems to be a “new” model called “Stakeholder Capitalism” is being espoused (although it is not new, I wrote about the pendulum swinging from stakeholder supremacy to shareholder supremacy back in the days of Milton Friedman in the <a href="https://bombthrower.com/articles/the-transition-overview-building-companies-that-matter/">inaugural post</a> for this site).</p>
<p>Recently I decided it would be helpful challenge my own reflexive inclination to suspect that we were all being collectively screwed by our institutions, yet again.&nbsp; I wondered if these momentous shifts were simply one of those tectonic phase shifts that occur throughout history and that I shouldn’t leap to the conclusion that it’s some disingenuous and ultimately malevolent&nbsp; pseudo-reality being imposed from above.</p>

<p>It is fitting that on this&nbsp; first day of #Davos2021 I outline my arc in which I tried to suspend disbelief around The Great Reset narrative, forcing myself to pose the question:</p>
<h3>What if The Great Reset was getting a bad rap?</h3>
<p>Maybe it’s true that the world has changed irrevocably, <em>and</em> that change hasn’t been driven or captured by a razor thin scab of elites at the top of the socio-economic pyramid who are setting the agenda. The idea of a reset may be well founded, after all when I first started writing about wealth inequality and crony capitalism over a decade ago, I called it <a href="https://rebootingcapitalism.com/">“Rebooting Capitalism”.</a></p>
<p>So I started going through Klaus Schwab’s books: <strong>The Fourth Industrial Revolution</strong> (2016), <strong>COVID-19: The Great Reset </strong>(2020) and most recently, <strong>Stakeholder Capitalism. </strong>(2021)<strong>. </strong>&nbsp;It started out as s a curious blend of nodding one’s head in agreement, underlining numerous passages, musing that maybe this is just descriptive, not prescriptive. By that I mean, maybe Schwab is simply trying to make sense of the shifts occurring, and not really offering frameworks around what&nbsp;<em>should</em> happen next, but just trying to parse what is happening and possible trajectories of the future.</p>
<p>This former case is similar to Warren Mosler’s description of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). It describes how Mosler and other MMT-ers think the system actually works and why the outcomes will not be as conventional economics generally fears. In Stephenie Kelton’s more recent book <strong>The Deficit Myth</strong>, she builds on this theme that MMT is more descriptive with some prescriptive policy <em>recommendations. </em>But my overall sense of it is that these books about MMT were more about trying to articulate a new way of looking at the existing system and not trying to drive a completely overriding agenda (even if that’s what would happen if policy makers <a href="https://bombthrower.com/articles/the-disturbing-rise-of-modern-monetary-theory-mmt/">seize on MMT as a rationalization</a> for destroying their currencies).</p>
<p>I mention MMT here specifically because we touch on it again when I contrast it to Charles Hugh Smith’s concept of Community Labour Integrated Money Economy (CLIME), a little later.</p>
<p>With Schwab, he spends a lot of time in a descriptive mode, talking about the what is happening in the world, although we do see some of his assumptions creeping in and for awhile, I am cautiously optimistic that if everything Schwab outlines as a&nbsp;<em>policy&nbsp;</em>response to global issues like global poverty, and of course now, the pandemic, maybe it’s just the way of the world and this is the direction things are going without there necessarily being a SPECTRE-like entity in the WEF driving a self-serving agenda.</p>
<p>When Schwab talks about how a grand ideal of a standard issue One World Government model, what he calls the Neoliberal Utopia simply will not work, I breathe a sigh of relief,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Consider&nbsp; a global government [that] regulates multinational companies in global markets, and people gather in a global democracy and global unions. It is an unrealistic an undesirable goal, as it increases the distance between individuals and the immediate social ecosystems they are a part of. It also decreases their feeling of commitment to the people and the environment closest to them…Though the 20th century neoliberalists once may have seen such a global model as a Utopian ideal, it would inevitably end in the political disenfranchisement of local communities. When the center of power is too far removed&nbsp; from people’s everyday realities, neither political governance nor economic decision-making would have popular support.”<br>
— Stakeholder Capitalism p.181</p></blockquote>

<p>But then, the more I read, the more I couldn’t shake the sense that when a guy like Schwab means by the word “commitment, what he really means is “obedience”. Schwab understands that people aren’t really going to accept decisions from on high, especially if on high is a centralized world government.</p>
<h2>What we really need is “Subsidiarity”</h2>
<p>Schwab goes on to introduce with a flourish one of the core pillars of Stakeholder Capitalism: <strong>Subsidiarity&nbsp;</strong>(the other is “Value creation and sharing”):</p>
<blockquote><p>A primary principle for the implementation of Stakeholder Capitalism is therefore that of&nbsp;<strong><em>subsidiarity.&nbsp;</em></strong>It is not an untested or purely theoretical principal. Applied most famously in the governance of the European Union..it asserts that decisions should be taken at the most granular level possible, closest to where they will have the most noticeable effects. It determines, in other words, that local stakeholders should be able to decide for themselves, <strong>except when it is not feasible or effective for them to do so.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Subsidiarity is&nbsp;<em>supposed</em> to mean “whatever can be done at lower levels of government should not be done at higher levels”, but my guess is the devil would be in the details. Like in that last sentence of the quote, when it is not feasible or effective for the “stakeholders” in Stakeholder Capitalism to decide certain matters for themselves, those will have to be decided for them.</p>
<p>What would those sorts of issues be?</p>
<p>Well for starters, there’s climate change. That’s one of the things that’s already been decided…</p>
<blockquote><p>“It makes sense to coordinate this challenge first at the global level.” but then the second level is at the national level, where countries can take different approaches, <em>a limit on auto travel would have significant effect in the United States</em>, where cars are the primary mode of transportation. Taking a different approach, such as <em>limiting air travel</em>, would affect certain groups of people more than others. Subsidiarity supports a national or local level of decision making for countries to determine which path will work best for them to effectively address the global goal”.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Schwab blithely bandies about various limitations and curtailments on everybody else’s range of motion and economic choices, there is never any treatment of climate change as anything&nbsp;<em>but </em> a global crisis that justifies the complete re-ordering of everybody’s lives.</p>
<p>And yet, the same level of drastic re-ordering of everybody else’s lives is proffered in Schwab’s other book, COVID-19: The Great Reset, even though by his own admission in that same book, COVID-19 is a not civilization ending plague:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Even in the worst-case horrendous scenario, COVID-19 will kill far fewer people than the Great Plagues, including the Black Deaths, or World War II did”<br>
— COVID-19: The Great Reset p. 17</p></blockquote>
<p>Albeit one that provides an excellent opportunity to reorder everybody else’s lives,</p>
<blockquote><p>changes that would have seemed inconceivable before the pandemic struck, such as new forms of monetary policy like helicopter money (already a given), the reconsideration/recalibration of some of our social priorities and augmented search for the common good as a policy objective, the notion of fairness acquiring political potency,&nbsp;<strong>radical welfare and taxation measures</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>drastic geopolitical realignments</strong>.</p>
<p>The broader point is this: the possibilities for change and the resulting new order are now unlimited and only bound by our imagination, for better or for worse. Societies could be poised to become either more egalitarian or more authoritarian, or geared towards more solidarity or more individualism, favouring the interests of the few or the many…</p></blockquote>
<p>You get the point: <strong><em>we (as in the WEF)</em>&nbsp;should take advantage of this unprecedented opportunity to reimagine <em>your</em> world</strong>.</p>
<p>If COVID-19 is a comparatively lightweight pandemic to be opportunistically seized upon to drastically reorder everybody’s lives, one cant help but wonder if the climate “crisis” isn’t yet another global softball. Perhaps in the cold light of day, it could turn out that climate change is either out of our hands (if it is driven largely or even partially <a href="https://www.livescience.com/61716-sun-cooling-global-warming.html">by solar cycles</a>) or that climate alarmism is in itself more toxic and destructive than the direct effects of climate change itself, as Michael Shellenberger asserts in <strong>“Apocalypse Never”</strong>,</p>
<blockquote><p>Apocalypse Never explores how and why so many of us came to see important but manageable environmental problems as the end of the world, and why the people who are the most apocalyptic about environmental problems tend to oppose the best and most obvious solutions to solving them.</p>
<p>Shellenberger, Michael. Apocalypse Never (p. xi). Harper. Kindle Edition.</p></blockquote>
<p>Shouldn’t there be some sort of process or governance structure in there to protect the world’s citizens from being overly regulated by somebody else’s idea of what is important? Should there be some counterbalance to these unilateral assessments of when drastic measures are required, especially when those measures would supersede our own agency in directing&nbsp; our own lives?</p>
<p>But there isn’t, not in Schwab’s Stakeholder Capitalism after the The Great Reset.</p>
<p>What we get instead is “subsidiarity”:</p>
<p>Another example around climate change, conspicuous in its lack of coverage in Schwab’s books is the idea of nuclear energy.</p>
<p>If the entire world is headed toward an eventual transition off of fossil fuels (if for no other reason than Peak Oil) then shouldn’t the safest, cleanest, efficient energy source be featured prominently? The <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/x-energy-developing-pebble-bed-reactor-they-say-cant-melt-down">next generation pebble bed reactors</a> and …</p></section></div>

<p>We often get customers&nbsp;ringing for quotes and being surprised (and sometimes shocked) at the prices we charge. We will get comments along the lines of <em>“So-and-so can do that airport trip for £35. <a href="https://www.harttaxis.com/what-does-it-cost-to-go-to-the-airport/">You’re charging £50</a>”</em>.</p>



<p>That is perfectly true. There will <em>always</em> be someone who can do the job at a lower price than Hart Taxis can. We do not compete on price.</p>


<div id="attachment_1405"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1405" loading="lazy" src="https://www.harttaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-Taxi-2-300x300.png" alt="Best Taxi service in Fleet, Yateley, Hartley Wintney" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://www.harttaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-Taxi-2-300x300.png 300w, https://www.harttaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-Taxi-2-150x150.png 150w, https://www.harttaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-Taxi-2-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://www.harttaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-Taxi-2-250x250.png 250w, https://www.harttaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-Taxi-2.png 1056w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-1405">Hart Taxis won the ‘Best Taxi Service in Fleet’ award for two years running.</p></div>
<p>The fact of the matter is that there is a set minimum cost to doing business in the taxi trade. This cost includes such items as hourly rates for drivers, servicing costs for vehicles, insurance, licence fees etc.</p>
<p>Some of these fees are non-negotiable: You have to have insurance and you have to have a hackney carriage licence.&nbsp;Other costs are more malleable. For example rather than trying to let a driver earn a living wage by working a maximum 12 hour shift you can cut the amount you pay a driver and force him to work 14 to 18 hours per day for 7 days per week to earn enough. There is an obvious impact on driver safety when this happens.</p>
<p>The other way is to cut down on the servicing for your vehicles. At a recent snap examination in the small hours of the morning the police and the VOSN stopped a number of taxis in Fleet and found that several of them were running vehicles with questionable service records. One of our competitor’s vehicles&nbsp;was found to have four bald tyres and was immediately impounded by the police as being unsafe to drive on the road. All Hart Taxis vehicles passed with flying colours.</p>
<p>The next time you book a vehicle which is ‘cheap’ bear in mind that the driver <em>may</em> have been working 14 or 15 hours when he gets to you and <em>may</em> be running a vehicle which is barely road legal. Both of these factors put you, the passenger, at risk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I work in the haulage&nbsp;business and understand the issues facing drivers working long hours. I’m happy to pay the rates Hart Taxis charge if it means my taxi will be on time, with a driver who is awake and ready to drive in a road-safe vehicle – A Hart Taxis customer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore there are some taxis who will cut costs by not providing a good service. This may be by promising to arrive at a certain time but then regularly turning up late. Sometimes late enough for you to miss your flight or your train at the station. They may arrive looking scruffy, unshaven or badly dressed. They may take you on a longer route than you expected and <a href="https://www.harttaxis.com/2018/04/know-the-full-fare-before-you-get-in-the-vehicle/">hike the fares up that way</a>. Or there may be additional hidden fees added to your fare when you arrive. A good example of this is those companies that <a href="https://www.harttaxis.com/what-does-it-cost-to-go-to-the-airport/">charge a low fare for an airport pick-up</a> but then hit you with parking fees and waiting time – especially if your plane arrives late.</p>
<p>Let me be clear; I am not saying that <em>all</em> our cheaper competitors are running their drivers ragged with dirty, unsafe vehicles, lying to customers about when they are going to arrive and causing them to miss their planes and trains. But I am saying that every single one of those behaviours has been reported for one or more of the taxi companies working in the Hart district. All of the companies who have had these behaviours reported about them charge less than Hart Taxis for their services.</p>
<p>With Hart Taxis you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smart drivers who have been working a maximum of 12 hours in a single shift and a maximum of 6 shifts per week.</li>
<li>Smart, washed and valeted cars</li>
<li>Road legal vehicles with full service history.</li>
<li>Vehicle tracking services so you can see where your driver is from when they accept your job to when they arrive.</li>
<li>Text information detailing the make, colour and registration of the vehicle that will be picking you up.</li>
<li>Meet and greet service at the airport where we monitor your incoming flight and only send the driver at the appropriate time.</li>

We seem to be able to wrap our heads around how to <a href="https://visiblechild.com/2015/07/20/limit-setting-grabbing/">respectfully set limits</a>, <a href="https://visiblechild.com/2015/07/04/choices-part-1-of-3-why-when/">offer choices</a>, acknowledge their feelings, understand the <a href="https://visiblechild.com/2015/06/22/consequences-how-we-misuse-them/">differences between natural and logical consequences</a>, even calmly support them through tantrums. But when push comes to shove, there is one thing that stumps us:</p>
<p>“What do I do when they simply refuse to do what I am asking them to do?”</p>
<p>I would reword the question, actually.&nbsp; Don’t get me wrong, I hear you.&nbsp; You’re asking what to do when your kids refuse to pick up their toys, put their clothes on, brush their teeth, clean up a mess they made.&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; i would still reword it.&nbsp; I hear the words that you are asking.&nbsp; And after they go through the filter that is oh-so-handily inside my ears, the question looks a lot more like:</p>
<p>“What do I do wh<img data-attachment-id="2056" data-permalink="https://visiblechild.com/2015/09/02/model-graciousness/tickertape/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/tickertape.jpg?fit=880%2C865&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="880,865" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="tickertape" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/tickertape.jpg?fit=300%2C295&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/tickertape.jpg?fit=640%2C629&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/tickertape.jpg?resize=150%2C147&amp;ssl=1" alt="tickertape" width="150" height="147" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/tickertape.jpg?resize=150%2C147&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7">en I’m not in control?”</p>
<p>That’s right.&nbsp; Control.&nbsp;&nbsp; We’re all a little obsessed with control, in my opinion.&nbsp; It’s one of those things that falls solidly in the “should” or “have to” category.&nbsp; It’s the lever on the ticker tape machine (oops, I think I’m dating myself–pic over there, just in case) that rolls out endless tape that reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>“If I don’t make them do it, I’m a pushover,”</p>
<p>“She HAS to.&nbsp; I’m the parent, I have to make her do it,”</p>
<p>“It’s my JOB to teach her.&nbsp; She may be stubborn, but I can outlast her.”</p>
<p>“My life is going to be hell if I don’t insist that they do it.&nbsp; They’ll walk all over me.”</p>
<p>“I am NOT going to have one of those entitled kids who expect their parents to do everything for them.”</p>
<p>“They have to learn responsibility and that actions have consequences!”</p>
<p>“I have to make it clear that I’m in charge. It’s non-negotiable.&nbsp; I’ll sit here until they do it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>What did you think and feel as you read those examples? My guess is that most of you felt some version of “That’s RIGHT!” And you would find a lot of support for that.&nbsp; Yes, even among “gentle” or “respectful” parents and bloggers.&nbsp; Ironically, I’ve found more rigidity among these communities than I might have expected.&nbsp; To me, it looks like a reaction to being seen as “permissive.”&nbsp; We want people to be sure to know that just because we’re respectful or gentle, we <strong><em>aren’t</em></strong> permissive, so we talk a lot about how to get kids to do things, because if we’re tough (and yet still kind), it proves that we’re not the doormats that people make us out to be.</p>
<p>I don’t buy it.</p>
<p>So once again, I find myself in a position of seeing things a bit differently (yeah, it’s my destiny.)&nbsp; You know what I think and feel as I read those examples up there?&nbsp; I think that they all sound a bit like we’re dealing with the enemy.&nbsp; They’re adversarial.&nbsp; I’m right, they’re wrong.&nbsp; I know better.&nbsp; They’re just stubborn.&nbsp; I have to break them.&nbsp; I’m The Parent.</p>
<p>Yup.&nbsp; Control.</p>
<p>And fear.&nbsp; Let’s not forget about fear.&nbsp; Fear that we’ll be ineffectual.&nbsp; Fear that our children will grow up to be entitled.&nbsp; Fear that our friends and relatives who think we’re those kooky people who do that “gentle discipline stuff” will laugh and shake their heads at us, either in our presence or behind our backs, or both.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or worse yet, they’ll “tsk” at us, as if to say “Well, if you were more in charge, your kids would have better manners.”&nbsp; Lots of fear in parenting.&nbsp; Yup.</p>
<p>See, the thing is, I don’t think we don’t have to have that sort of relationship with our children. I know we think we do.&nbsp; But we don’t.&nbsp; It’s a choice.&nbsp; It’s not a non-negotiable.&nbsp; There <em>are</em> other ways.&nbsp; So let’s talk about just one of them.&nbsp; And no, it does NOT lead to children who walk all over you.</p>
<p>Now, before you think I’ve gone completely loony tunes (or–gasp–that I <em>am</em> in favor of permissiveness, which I assure you that I am not), let me say that yes, I do know and accept that our role as parents is to “teach” responsibility, values, helpfulness, manners, self-care, independence, routines, cause and effect, blah blah blah.&nbsp; The problem–and it<em> is</em> a problem–is that these are things that can’t be taught.&nbsp; Well, okay, they can be taught.&nbsp; It’s true, you can make your kid do anything. But the things that you “teach” don’t stick.&nbsp; Not in the way that I want them to at least.</p>
<p>Children do not learn from what we say.&nbsp; They don’t even learn from what we do.&nbsp; <strong>They learn from who we are.&nbsp; And they’re always watching.</strong></p>
<p>That’s why I choose to model graciousness.</p>
<p>Now before we go any further, let me just say that, although I have used this strategy for as long as I can remember–first with the children I worked with and then with my own child–I did not come up with this nifty difty little name.&nbsp; I owe that to a wonderful woman from New Zealand, an unschooling mom that I met online in several RIE discussion groups.&nbsp; Whenever this topic would come up, she would be a lone voice.&nbsp; Amid the fifty or sixty comments in which parents gave one another tip after tip about how to get-the-kid-to-do-the-thing, suddenly her name would appear, and next to it, it would say two words:&nbsp; Model Graciousness.&nbsp; There it was.&nbsp; In two words.&nbsp; Perfect.&nbsp; (<em>Thank you, L.</em>)</p>
<p>So this is my answer (now that I have a name for it and all.)&nbsp; Model graciousness.</p>
<p>What does it mean?</p>
<p>It means that you demonstrate and model for them the authentic spirit and intention that you wish for them to possess.&nbsp; If you want them to be generous, be generous (yes, of spirit, not just with “things.”)&nbsp; If you want them to be helpful, be helpful.&nbsp; If you want them to help without being asked, help without being asked.&nbsp; If you want them to speak softly, speak softly.&nbsp; If you want them to say thank you, say thank you.&nbsp; Always without resentment—because I presume that you don’t want children who resent you.&nbsp; You get the idea.</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; It’s really that simple.</p>
<p>She intentionally (or so it appears) pours a glass of milk on to the table, where it cascades on to the floor.&nbsp; Having he<a href="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/spilled-milk.jpeg?ssl=1"><img data-attachment-id="2051" data-permalink="https://visiblechild.com/2015/09/02/model-graciousness/spilled-milk/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/spilled-milk.jpeg?fit=500%2C623&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="500,623" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="spilled-milk" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/spilled-milk.jpeg?fit=241%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/spilled-milk.jpeg?fit=500%2C623&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/spilled-milk.jpeg?resize=241%2C300&amp;ssl=1" alt="spilled-milk" width="241" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/spilled-milk.jpeg?resize=241%2C300&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a>r help clean it up is a logical consequence.&nbsp; You get her a rag, and you ask (or preferably, tell) her to clean up the milk she spilled.&nbsp; She refuses.&nbsp; Or laughs.&nbsp; Or runs off.&nbsp; You go get her and you calmly explain that the milk is on the floor and it has to get cleaned up because if it stays there it will start to smell really bad and it will make the floor slippery and dangerous, and that you’d like her to help clean it up, and that you will help her.&nbsp; You get two cloths, and offer her one, and you ask (tell) her “I need your help to clean up the milk.&nbsp; Here is your cloth and here is my cloth.&nbsp; We’ll do it together.”&nbsp; Or you get one cloth and a small container of water, and you say “We need to clean up the milk.&nbsp; Would you like to use the cloth to wipe it up or would you like to hold the container while I wipe it up?”&nbsp; <em><strong>(Pay attention: here’s where it gets tricky.&nbsp; don’t stop reading now!)&nbsp; </strong></em>She refuses again.&nbsp; Or laughs again.&nbsp; Or throws the rag.&nbsp; Or runs off again.&nbsp; You’re sitting there (undoubtedly frustrated) thinking <em>“But I asked just the right way!&nbsp; I gave her choices!&nbsp; I offered to help her!&nbsp; She can’t just pour milk on the floor and not have any consequence!&nbsp; I have to wait her out or make her come do it–how do I do that?&nbsp; I’m perfectly calm, I’m not getting upset, I’m doing everything the way the books/experts say to do, and she’s still not helping!&nbsp; I have the most out of control kid ever.&nbsp; What now?!?)</em></p>
<p>I’ll tell you “what now.”&nbsp; Model graciousness.&nbsp; Clean it up.&nbsp; Say, with confidence (and feel with confidence, too…that matters) that you’re happy to help this time and that you’re sure she will help next time.&nbsp; Because you <em>are</em> sure that she’ll help next time (right??)&nbsp; And if it turns out that you’re wrong, and she <em>doesn’t</em> help next time, still have confidence that she will do it the next time (and chalk it up to developmental stage or fatigue or teething or a long day at school or that toy that broke earlier in the day.)&nbsp; Quiet the anxious voices in your head that say “<em>if i clean it up,</em> <em>she’ll never learn responsibility</em>.”&nbsp; Quiet the resentful voices in your head that say <em>“I’m sick of doing everything for her when she’s perfectly capable of doing it herself.</em>” Quiet the punitive voices in your head that say “<em>she spilled it, she needs to clean it up.”</em> &nbsp; Have trust that she will do it next time.&nbsp; Because one of these times, she will.&nbsp; <strong>She will be like you.&nbsp; Helpful.&nbsp; Generous.&nbsp; Altruistic.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I would give another example, but it works pretty much the same way no matter what the example is.&nbsp; You know that expression “Be the change you wish to see in the world?”&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; This is that, parenting style.</p>
<p>You want to know why.&nbsp; I know you want to know why.&nbsp; So I’m going to put it as simply as I possibly can:&nbsp; <strong>“I didn’t do it.”</strong></p>
<p>I know that all of us have heard this,&nbsp; whether as a child ourselves, as a teacher, as a parent, among extended family, or at the park.&nbsp; A parent or a teacher or an older child asks (tells?) children to clean something up.&nbsp; They say “I didn’t do it”&nbsp; or “It’s not my mess” or “<em>You</em> clean it up” or “I wasn’t working over there.”</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but for me, this phrase is like fingernails on a chalkboard.&nbsp; It is the epitome of everything that I do not want my child to be.&nbsp; I want to raise a child who is prosocial, generous, altruistic, empathic.&nbsp; I want my child to be the one the teacher sends an email about because she was the only one who didn’t laugh when another child’s experiment blew up in science class, and the only one who went over and helped him clean it up without being asked.&nbsp; I never want to hear the words “it’s not my mess” come out of my child’s mouth when she is asked to help clean up–by me or anyone else. I want her to smile and say “Sure.”&nbsp; And I don’t only want her to help–I want her to help without resentment of any sort. (is it a pipe dream?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; It isn’t.)&nbsp; This is what altruism <em>is.</em>&nbsp; I hold it sacred.</p>
<p>If I want <em>her</em> to do that and be that person, then<em> I</em> have to do that and be that person.&nbsp; Help without resentment.&nbsp; Accept others’ emotional or developmental limitations, either in general or in the moment.&nbsp; …</p></div></div>

January 25, 2021 | https://nixintel.info/osint-tools/getting-started-with-overpass-turbo-part-1/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nixintel.info/osint-tools/getting-started-with-overpass-turbo-part-1/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> 
						<div>
							 
							
<p>The <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.openstreetmap.org">Open Street Map database</a> contains detailed information about almost every square metre of the surface of the planet. Land use, building types, rivers, park benches, pubs, streets and millions of other data points are all mapped out and documented in detail.</p>



<div><p>You might be familiar with the browser-based <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">Open Street Map (OSM) website</a>. Superficially it resembles mapping services like Google or Bing, but you may not be aware that the huge mapping dataset that powers it can also be accessed directly. Need to find all the power lines in a city? Count the number of pubs per square kilometre? Visualise COVID cases region by region? Or maybe you just want to solve a <a href="https://quiztime.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://quiztime.com">Quiztime</a> puzzle? OSM’s vast database can be queried to support almost any mapping use case you can think of.</p><p>The OSM database can be queried via an API called <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API" data-type="URL" data-id="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API">Overpass</a>. It’s very powerful but it isn’t very beginner friendly and constructing queries requires a little coding knowledge. </p></div>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1030" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.21.47-2048x1030.png" alt="" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.21.47-2048x1030.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.21.47-300x151.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.21.47-768x386.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.21.47-1536x773.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"></figure></div>



<p>A more accessible way to access Overpass exists in the form of <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/">Overpass Turbo</a>. Overpass Turbo allows you to build Overpass queries in a much more user friendly way. You can build the query, run it, and then see the data represented on the map. The results can also be returned in a CSV or JSON format, which makes incorporating them into your own mapping projects much easier.</p>



<h3>Basic Concepts</h3>



<p>Although Overpass Turbo is more user friendly than querying Overpass directly, it is nothing like as easy to use as Google Maps for example. It is much more powerful than Google Maps, but constructing effective queries requires an understanding of the data types that OSM contains. </p>



<div><p>The syntax is also much stricter. If you enter “five star hotel near Disneyland” as your Overpass Turbo query, you won’t get very far.</p><p>It’s worth spending a short time getting familiar with the basic types of OSM data before starting to build queries. </p></div>



<h3>Geometries</h3>



<p>There are three main types of object in the OSM database. These are known as geometries. Every object represented on an OSM map is one of these types.</p>



<h3>Node</h3>



<p>A node is a single point on a map. It has a unique ID number and a set of coordinates. <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4340279542#map=17/52.28932/8.03031" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4340279542#map=17/52.28932/8.03031">This park bench</a> next to a canal in the city of Osnabrück is a single node:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1858" height="1440" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.52.42.png" alt="" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.52.42.png 1858w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.52.42-300x233.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.52.42-768x595.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.52.42-1536x1190.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1858px) 100vw, 1858px"></figure></div>



<p>You can see it has a unique ID number, lat/long coordinates, and some tags that describe its properties. We’ll discuss tags shortly.</p>



<h3>Way</h3>



<p>Next to the bench is a railway line. Linear features cannot be represented by a single node on a map, so paths, roads, rivers and motorways are represented by multiple nodes linked together to form a way. A way is just a collection of linked nodes.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="884" height="882" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.16.52.png" alt="" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.16.52.png 884w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.16.52-300x300.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.16.52-150x150.png 150w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.16.52-768x766.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 884px) 100vw, 884px"></figure></div>



<p>Ways do not just have to be linear like railways or canals. A collection of nodes can start and end on the same point to form a shape. <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/94423432">This airfield</a> just outside Osnabrück is not a node, but a way. Its boundary is defined by a series of single nodes linked together to form a polygon:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1058" height="674" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.19.04.png" alt="" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.19.04.png 1058w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.19.04-300x191.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.19.04-768x489.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1058px) 100vw, 1058px"></figure></div>



<p>So to find objects that are greater than a single point on a map, it is necessary to search for ways and not just nodes. We will see shortly that there is a way to combine these kinds of query, but we need to look at the final data type first.</p>



<h3>Relation</h3>



<p>A node is a single point. A way is a series of linked nodes. A relation combines ways and nodes to form more complex objects. </p>



<p>Let’s say that you want to represent a train route in OSM. You have nodes (stations, signals) and ways (track sections, bridges, perhaps larger stations). To represent the route would require combining these nodes and ways into a single “route” object. These kind of combinations are known as “relations”.</p>



<p>Let’s go back to Osnabrück. The Hafen area is an administrative district in the north of the city. In OSM it is a collection of ways that mark the geographic boundary and also a single node denoting it is an administrative centre. It is too complex an object to be either just a way or just a node, so the nodes and ways are combined to form a relation.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1168" height="1178" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.17.40.png" alt="" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.17.40.png 1168w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.17.40-297x300.png 297w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.17.40-150x150.png 150w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.17.40-768x775.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1168px) 100vw, 1168px"></figure></div>



<p>Multiple ways form the boundary. The single node in the middle refers to the administrative centre. This can be seen in the info panel in OSM (right click on the map and click “query features”):</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="658" height="438" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.38.53.png" alt="" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.38.53.png 658w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.38.53-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px"></figure></div>



<p>The Hafen area is a <em>relation</em> made up of 5 <em>ways</em> and a single <em>node</em>.</p>



<h3>Tags</h3>



<p>Tags are the key to finding information in OSM. As we’ve just seen, every object in OSM is either a node, way, or a relation. These objects contain location data but they do not contain descriptive information. Nodes, ways and objects are labelled and described with a series of Tags. </p>



<p>The first object we looked at was a <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4340279543">park bench</a>. It’s a node with a unique reference number of 4340279543 and lat/long coordinates of <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=18/52.2910290/8.0265765">52.2910290, 8.0265765</a>. That is all the information a node needs to exist – but how could anyone ever find it or even know what it was based on those details alone? </p>



<p>OSM objects need additional information in order for them to be described and indexed properly. Tags are used to do this. The bench has several tags to describe it:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="658" height="438" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.48.49.png" alt="" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.48.49.png 658w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.48.49-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px"></figure></div>



<p>This is a very powerful system, but there is one difficulty with tags. In Overpass Turbo I cannot just do a freetext search like “park bench” and be certain that I will find a matching tag. The tags I use to search have to match exactly with the tags as they were assigned by OSM contributors, so if I just guess the tag name I will probably be wrong and I won’t find what I’m looking for. Overpass Turbo’s Query Wizard can help slightly by suggesting tags based on search terms, but it pays to know how tags are constructed in order to be as accurate as possible with your results.</p>



<h3>TagInfo</h3>



<p>OSM’s <a href="https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/">Taginfo site </a>allows you to search for tags that have already been added to the database. Using the search box in the top right we can search for the keys and values that make up tags so they can be added to our queries.</p>



<p>Let’s say that I want to find wind turbines. I enter the term “wind turbine” into the Taginfo search box and get <a href="https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/search?q=wind+turbine#keys">these results</a>. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-22.04.57.png" alt="" width="722" height="391" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-22.04.57.png 1812w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-22.04.57-300x163.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-22.04.57-768x417.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-22.04.57-1536x834.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px"></figure></div>



<p>OSM Tags are always made up of a key-value pair. You can think of keys as a main type, and values as a subtype. Examples of common key-value pairs might be <code data-enlighter-language="raw">building=school,</code> or <code data-enlighter-language="raw">highway=motorway.</code> </p>



<p>This means that just creating a tag called “wind turbine” won’t work in OSM. The tag must have both a key <em>and</em> a value.</p>



<p>The image above shows how people have created key-value pairs to describe wind turbines. By far the most popular is the tag <code data-enlighter-language="md">generator:method = wind_turbine</code>. </p>



<p>You can see the tag is comprised of the key <code data-enlighter-language="generic">generator:method</code> and the value <code data-enlighter-language="generic">wind_turbine.</code> You can also see that there are 240,052 objects in the OSM database that are tagged this way, so to find a wind turbine this will be the best tag to use. By contrast if I searched with the tag <code data-enlighter-language="generic">name = Wind turbine</code> this would only match 18 objects in the entire database, so I’m unlikely to find what I’m looking for.</p>



<p>Here are all the results for the <code>generator:method = wind_turbine</code> query in Osnabrück:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="421" height="475" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-25-at-14.08.12.png" alt="" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-25-at-14.08.12.png 421w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-25-at-14.08.12-266x300.png 266w" sizes="(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px"></figure></div>



<h3>Bounding Boxes</h3>



<p>Before putting these concepts into action it’s important to mention the concept of bounding boxes. When querying Overpass it is necesary to set a North, South, East and West boundary point of the box you wish to search in. These are normally defined with coordinates sent to the API, but fortunately Overpass Turbo creates this box for you based on the map area in view in the right hand window. The coordinates are represented by the <code data-enlighter-language="generic">{{bbox}}</code> tag in the query code. Overpass Turbo will only search for data matches within the box area you specify.</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>In this post we’ve looked at the basic building blocks of OSM and Overpass Turbo. In the next post we’ll put them together to build some queries and start retrieving data.</p>

way since my <a href="https://www.a1k0n.net/2018/11/13/fast-line-following.html">last post</a> on the subject.
I want to highlight a localization algorithm I came up with which works really
well, at least in this specific setting. I’ve been using it in races for a
while and it really stepped up the speeds I was able to achieve without the car
getting “lost” – about 22mph on the front straight of this small track. It
makes use of a fisheye camera looking towards the ceiling, and a localization
update runs in about 1ms at 640x480 on a Raspberry Pi 3, with precision on the
order of a few centimeters.</p>

<p>Here is a recent race against <a href="https://twitter.com/SmallPixelCar">another car</a>
which is about as fast, except it uses LIDAR to localize using the traffic
cones as landmarks. (My car previously localized using the cones as well,
except using a monocular camera, but the ceiling lights are much better when we
have them. Cone-based localization deserves a blog post of its own.) It’s a
three lap head-to-head race where there’s an extra random cone on the track. We
haven’t developed passing strategies yet though, so there are frequent racing
incidents…</p>

<p><em>DIYRobocars race on March 7, 2020. We had a little accident but my car (blue)
somehow made it through unscathed… I finished my three laps just to record a
time for that heat.</em></p>

<p>I put a fisheye lens Raspberry Pi camera out the front windshield of a 1/10
scale touring car. It’s mounted sideways because it has a wider field of view
horizontally, and I wanted more pixels looking towards the front so I could see
a bit of the ground ahead. (Full hardware details are on <a href="https://github.com/a1k0n/cycloid/">the github
repo</a>.) Here is what it looks like without
the lid:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.a1k0n.net/img/cycloid_hw.jpg" alt="RC car hardware"></p>

<p>I record telemetry and video in each race, which I can then replay through a
<a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">Dear ImGui</a>-based tool:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgfW2d5h_GI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In the lower-right corner of the video is a virtual view of the car’s position
and speed, entirely derived from the ceiling light localization algorithm.</p>

<p>With the fisheye lens, it can see a <em>lot</em> of ceiling lights from any point on
the track, and they’re all set up in a regular grid with one or two exceptions.
The algorithm is robust to extra lights being added, lights being burned out,
and other cars flying over the top of the camera (watch closely at 0:07),
without losing tracking.</p>

<p>Since it’s hard to tell what’s going on from the raw, sideways fisheye camera,
the tool has an option to use <code>cv2.undistort</code> and remap the image as if it were
looking straight out the front windshield:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3FvOCsjPew8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<p>To make this practical at high FPS on a Raspberry Pi, I chose to make some
simplifying assumptions: assume all the ceiling lights are point sources on a
perfectly even grid, and that the camera moves along the floor at a fixed
height. This turned out to be good enough to work in practice. The method
doesn’t necessarily require an even grid, it just needs to be able to determine
the distance to the nearest landmark from any point. In a grid, that’s trivial,
but it’s not hard to use a map of the ceiling layout instead.</p>

<p>I also assumed I knew the grid size ahead of time, since I can just measure the
ceiling tile sizes and count the spaces between lights, and also measure the
height of the ceiling from the camera.</p>

<p>Further, the setting allows us to initialize the algorithm approximately at a
known location, namely the starting line. If the pattern of lights is perfectly
regular, there’s no way to tell which grid cell you started in, so we have to
assume we’re at the one containing the start of the race when we reset our
state.</p>


<p><img src="https://www.a1k0n.net/img/ceiltrack-undistort.jpg" alt="undistorting fisheye"></p>

<p>The first step is to deal with the lens distortion. This is particularly
obvious when using a fisheye lens, but every lens should be calibrated. OpenCV
provides <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/db/d58/group__calib3d__fisheye.html">a
module</a> for
calibrating converting from distorted/undistorted fisheye coordinates.</p>

<p>I won’t go too much into camera calibration here, but what I do is print <a href="https://github.com/a1k0n/cycloid/blob/master/tools/camcal/calboard.png">this
ArUco calibration
target</a>,
take still photos of it from several angles, and use <a href="https://github.com/a1k0n/cycloid/blob/master/tools/camcal/cal.py">this
script</a> to
get the camera intrinsic parameters.</p>

<p>With those parameters, you can use several OpenCV utilities to do things like
undistort images (shown above) or compute ideal pinhole camera ray vectors from
each pixel with <code>cv2.undistortPoints</code>.</p>

<p>In my tracking code, the initialization step computes a lookup table with the
supplied camera parameters. For each pixel, the lookup table has a \(\left[x,
y, 1\right]\) vector which forms a ray in 3D space starting at the camera and
heading out towards the ceiling. There is also a circular mask to filter out
pixels pointing too far away from the ceiling.</p>

<p>Note that the tracking code does <em>not</em> use <code>cv2.undistortImage</code> or equivalent.
The illustration above shows what undistorting the whole image does: objects
far away from the camera with relatively small numbers of pixels in the source
image take up a large number of blurry pixels in the output, and the objects
directly in front taking up most of the image are a small portion of the
output. What I want to do is give equal weight to each pixel in the source
image, and less weight to potential outliers. That way, the lights directly
above the camera are mostly what it will try to track on, which gives better
accuracy.</p>

<p>Once the lookup table is available, the problem reduces to matching a 2D grid
to all the corrected pixel locations for all pixels within the mask which look
like ceiling lights, meaning the grayscale pixel is brighter than some
threshold. The mask is necessary to deal with reflections from the car’s body
and light from nearby windows – it makes sure we’re only looking upwards for
ceiling lights.</p>



<p><img src="https://www.a1k0n.net/img/ceiltrack-iteration.png" alt="aligning a grid to ceiling lights"><br>
<em>Grid alignment objective. Blue dots: initial uninitialized configuration \([u,
v, \theta] = (0, 0, 0)\); orange dots: fit after five iterations of
the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm described below. Left: the grid dots are
transformed back into the fisheye distortion here to show the fit on the
original image. Right: the fit in undistorted space.</em></p>

<p>We can solve this with the same hammer we pound on all the other nails with in
computer vision: nonlinear least squares via
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenberg%E2%80%93Marquardt_algorithm">Levenberg-Marquardt</a>,
which is a fancy name for the ordinary least squares algorithm with a
simple tweak to make sure it converges.</p>

<p>The vehicle state is defined as \([u, v, \theta]\) where \(u, v\) are the
position within the grid along the \(x\) and \(y\) axes respectively, and
\(\theta\) is the heading angle of the vehicle. We’ll also define \(x_{spc}\)
and \(y_{spc}\) as the grid spacing in each axis.</p>

<p>Conceptually, if we superimpose a grid with that spacing on the ceiling, rotate
it by \(-\theta\) around the center and then translate it by \([-u, -v]\), the
grid should line up with the pixels in our image which are above the “white”
threshold.</p>

<p>To do the optimization, we start with an initial guess for \([u, v, \theta\)]
and repeat two steps: First, find the nearest grid point to every transformed
white pixel, and then solve for an updated \([u, v, \theta]\) to minimize the
residuals. Solving for \([u, v, \theta]\) may cause some pixels to match
different grid points, so repeating the two steps a few times is usually
necessary, otherwise it would be solved in closed form. In practice, once the
algorithm is “synced up”, only two iterations are really necessary to keep up
with tracking.</p>

<p>Let’s define a residual for every undistorted white pixel \([x_i, y_i]\)
measuring the distance to the closest grid point \([g_{xi}, g_{yi}]\):</p>

\[\mathbf{r}_i = \begin{bmatrix}\cos{\theta} &amp; \sin{\theta}\\-\sin{\theta} &amp; \cos{\theta}\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}x_i \\ y_i \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix}u \\ v \end{bmatrix} -
\begin{bmatrix}g_{xi} \\ g_{yi} \end{bmatrix}\]

<p>This says: Rotate each pixel \([x_i, y_i]\) by the car’s heading angle
\(\theta\), subtract the car’s position \([u, v]\), and compare it to the grid
point we think it should be on \([g_{xi}, g_{yi}]\). We want to minimize the
sum of the squares of all residuals, \(\sum_{i} \mathbf{r}_{i}^\top \mathbf{r}_i\).</p>

<p>(Note: \([x_i, y_i]\) here are the pixels after undoing the camera transform /
distortion, so they are not pixel coordinates but rather normalized
coordinates. You can think of it as a ray shooting from the camera intersecting
a plane 1 unit in front of the camera; (1, 0) would thus be a ray 45-degree
angle to the right of center shooting out of the camera.)</p>

<p>If we’re fitting to a grid, then \([g_{xi}, g_{yi}]\) can be found simply by
taking the transformed point modulo the grid spacing \(x_{spc}, y_{spc}\). In
principle, any pattern of landmarks, not just grids, can be used here.</p>

<p>Here’s my Python prototype implementation that finds the nearest grid point:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>moddist</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>q</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>q</span><span>/</span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>%</span><span>q</span> <span>-</span> <span>q</span><span>/</span><span>2</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>gxi</span><span>,</span> <span>gyi</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To do the least-squares minimization, we need to compute the Jacobian (a fancy
word for the derivative of a vector with respect to a vector) of the residuals,
which is simple enough. I used <a href="https://www.sympy.org/">SymPy</a> in a Jupyter
notebook:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

\[\left[\begin{matrix}- g_{x i} - u + x_{i} \cos{\left(\theta \right)} + y_{i} \sin{\left(\theta \right)}\\- g_{y i} - v - x_{i} \sin{\left(\theta \right)} + y_{i} \cos{\left(\theta \right)}\end{matrix}\right]\]

<div><div><pre><code><span>J</span> <span>=</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>jacobian</span><span>(</span><span>Matrix</span><span>([[</span><span>u</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span><span>,</span> <span>theta</span><span>]]))</span>

<p>Now, to actually compute our least squares update, we need to compute
\(\delta = \left(\sum_i \mathbf{J}_i^\top \mathbf{J}_i + \lambda \mathbf{I}
\right)^{-1} \left(\sum_i \mathbf{J}_i^\top \mathbf{r}_i\right)\). Looks
complicated, but what it means is we need to add a up contribution for …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

They downloaded all articles that documented corporate scandals involving the term “sexual harassment” or its synonyms. These included for example “sexual misconduct” or “indecent assault.”</p><p>This resulted in a data set of almost 15,000 articles. Many of these articles involved privately held firms, or articles where the term “sexual harassment” occurred in an irrelevant context. These articles were discarded. The researchers also discarded articles about companies that were facing bankruptcy around the time of the scandal (but for reasons unrelated to the scandal), and other confounding factors such as activist investors attempting to gain control of a company’s board.</p><h2>From consumer favorites to financial powerhouses</h2><p>The researchers ultimately wound up with a list of 199 sexual harassment scandals. These included many household names, such as Disney, Tesla, Amazon, Google, and <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/study-claims-72-accuracy-in-predicting-someones-political-orientation-based-on-a-single-photo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a>. The list also included financial firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, and popular media brands including The New York Times, Fox, and CBS.</p><p>About 78% of the scandals took place in the US, and another 18% in other English-speaking countries. The accuser was a female in 88% of the cases; 73% of cases had only one accuser. The data set included roughly equal numbers of physical and non-physical harassment cases. The accused personnel were CEOs (14%), other executives (26%), or non-executives (60%).</p><h2><strong>The economic costs of sexual harassment</strong> <strong>in numbers</strong></h2><p>The researchers found “a negative 1.5% cumulative abnormal return over the event day and the following trading day.” For the roughly 200 companies in their sample, that corresponded to an average impact of $450&nbsp;million.</p><p>In the long term, the companies hit by such a scandal recovered only about half of that lost market value. The long-term average was a 0.8% loss, worth on average about $250&nbsp;million.</p><h2><strong>Emergence of the #MeToo movement</strong></h2><p>The study also found the impact of sexual harassment scandals on company value was about the same both before and after the emergence of the #MeToo movement. The paper dates that mergence as October 5, 2017. That is the day that The New York Times published its first article about the systematic sexual misconduct of Harvey Weinstein.</p><p>In contrast, the number of sexual harassment scandals at public companies has quadrupled since the emergence of the #MeToo movement. About 45% of the cases in this data set took place after October 2017.</p><p>Furthermore, the study also found that the market impact was lower in countries with lower levels of gender equality.</p><h2><strong>What raises or lowers the</strong> <strong>economic costs of sexual harassment</strong>?</h2><p>The involvement of a CEO in the scandal was a consistent driver of negative returns, adding an additional 5% drop in company value. Similarly, more media attention also corresponded to greater losses.</p><p>On the other hand, instances where companies self-disclosed the misconduct before it was discovered by the media were punished considerably less by the market. The market reaction was also less severe in cases where the accused CEO left the firm, versus staying on.</p><p>The study found that these losses stem mostly from damage to the firm’s reputation and public sentiment, rather than the costs of penalties and compensation claims, or the costs associated with the loss of expensive personnel.</p><p>In terms of damage control, the authors found that “immediate attempts at reputational repair are associated with alleviated market responses.” In other words, “the reputational effect and impact on public sentiment is an important channel of impact on market value” for companies embroiled in such a scandal.</p><p>In sum, the authors conclude, “there is a highly significant negative market reaction to sexual harassment scandals that can wipe off enormous amounts of market value in a matter of days.”</p><p>And these findings should put to rest “any remaining contemplation among managers and investors about whether sexual harassment is a real business risk,” they write. “The impact is shown to be both real and economically significant.”</p><hr><p><strong>Study: </strong>“#MeToo: Sexual harassment and company value”<br><strong>Authors:</strong> Mads Borelli-Kjaer, Laurids Moehl Schack, and Ulf Nielsson<br><strong>Published in:</strong> <em><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-corporate-finance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of Corporate Finance</a></em><br><strong>Publication date: </strong>January 6, 2021<br><strong>DOI:</strong> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2020.101875" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2020.101875</a><br><strong>Photo:</strong> by&nbsp;<a href="https://pixabay.com/users/mohamed_hassan-5229782/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=4499303">Mohamed Hassan</a>&nbsp;via&nbsp;<a href="https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=4499303">Pixabay</a>&nbsp;</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

He's the founder and leader of the Storm Weather Shanty Choir, who fans of the show will know as the group of Norwegian musicians who have mastered the art of the modern sea shanty. And Haakon is a REAL sailor - he's heavily involved with Norway's tallship Statsraad Lehmkul and has sailed her trans-Atlantic 4 times, practicing his shanties in real life aboard the ship. I traveled to Bergen to meet Haakon for this interview and to see the Shanty Choir live. </p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1546224470745_55082"><div><p><strong>On The Wind is the evolution of 59º North</strong>, and is, quite simply, long-form conversations with sailors from around the world.

In
<a href="https://www.arun.is/blog/apple-watch">my review of the Apple Watch Series 6</a>, I described how it
sits at the confluence of design, technology, lifestyle, and watchmaking. This
perfect blend of so many different disciplines and constraints puts it in a
category all by itself.</p><p>Apple did this not by taking an age-old wristwatch silhouette and cramming some
electronics in it. Instead, they carefully reimagined every aspect, from the
user interaction patterns to the mechanism securing the interchangeable bands,
the digital crown, the variety of cases and bands, and the use of watch terms
like “complication” in the user experience.</p><p>In particular, the analog faces reveal what Apple does so well — taking the
familiar and making it their own. Over the years, they have released quite a few
faces with roots in history. Each one started as an iconic watch archetype and
was remade to take advantage of the Apple Watch platform.</p><h2 id="watch-terminology">Watch terminology</h2><p>Before jumping into the Apple Watch, let’s review some useful watch terminology.</p><p><span><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/502880983?background=1" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="" title="vimeo video"></iframe></span></p><p>Some additional terms that were difficult to illustrate:</p><ol><li><strong>Case:</strong> The case is the enclosure that houses the watch internals and
around which everything else is attached.</li><li><strong>Movement:</strong> The movement is the heart of the watch. It is the mechanism in
charge of keeping time and running any complications.</li><li><strong>Subdial:</strong> Subdials are smaller dials within the main dial. They are often
used to track the seconds or power reserve.</li><li><strong>Complication:</strong> This term refers to any function aside from time-keeping,
such as the date, or moonphase.</li><li><strong>Crystal:</strong> The crystal is the clear material that protects the watch dial.
Crystals are usually made of plastic, mineral glass, or synthetic sapphire,
which has a hardness only topped by diamond.</li><li><strong>Reference number:</strong> Similar to model numbers in other products, the
reference number can be used to identify the model, material, dial,
movement, and more. Often, collectors use reference numbers instead of names
in order to be specific.</li></ol><h2 id="the-main-elements-of-an-apple-watch-face">The main elements of an Apple Watch face</h2><p>Continuing on, to appreciate what makes each of Apple’s historically-derived
faces unique, let’s start by understanding what they have in common. They come
in two primary shapes, rectangular and circular.</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="intro shapes" title="intro shapes" src="https://www.arun.is/static/672c57426cb2258381db7b34c1c330d7/20801/intro_shapes.jpg" srcset="https://www.arun.is/static/672c57426cb2258381db7b34c1c330d7/98e5d/intro_shapes.jpg 180w,https://www.arun.is/static/672c57426cb2258381db7b34c1c330d7/543cd/intro_shapes.jpg 360w,https://www.arun.is/static/672c57426cb2258381db7b34c1c330d7/20801/intro_shapes.jpg 720w,https://www.arun.is/static/672c57426cb2258381db7b34c1c330d7/b37e7/intro_shapes.jpg 1080w,https://www.arun.is/static/672c57426cb2258381db7b34c1c330d7/33266/intro_shapes.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>Some faces integrate both the dial and bezel on screen, which is likely why
Apple decided to call them faces instead of dials.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>Regardless of the shape, they employ the same hands in slightly different color
combinations. Most have hour, minute, and second hands. Some hands are solid,
while others are outlined with a contrasting color on the inside as if using
luminous material.</p><p><span>

of pre-made color combinations.</p><p>Let’s dive into five Apple Watch faces — California, Chronograph, Chronograph
Pro, Count Up, and GMT.</p><h2 id="california">California&nbsp;</h2><h3 id="the-history-of-the-california-dial">The history of the California dial</h3><p>The California face is not a reference, as some may think, to Apple’s
headquarters, but in fact, to a dial design originating during World War II.</p><p>Originally called the “error proof” or “high visibility” dial, it adorned the
fronts of
<a href="https://www.bobswatches.com/rolex-blog/watch-review/rolex-bubble-back.html">“bubble back”</a>
Rolexes — so-called because of the bubble-shaped back that gave the watches a
thin appearance. Strikingly, the indices are set both in Roman and Arabic
numerals where other watches would stick to one or the other. It’s thought that
mixing numerals aids both the wearer and his brothers-in-arms in reading the
watch in low visibility conditions.</p><p><span>

history. Then, the Bubbleback Rolex made a comeback in Japan during the economic
boom of the 80s<sup id="3"><a href="#footnote_3">[3]</a></sup>. They became so
popular that demand quickly dwarfed supply. A dial finishing company in LA
started refinishing dials on existing watches with half-Roman, half-Arabic
indices to meet the tremendous demand. Legend says that they became known as
California dials as these remakes from LA starting flooding the market. Then, as
the boom became a bust, the popularity of the California dial waned again.</p><p>Since the 80s, the California dial was revived in some Tudors and Panerais,
which are still made today and surprisingly officially referred to as California
dials.</p><p><span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Clean code is like clean garbage – it’s only truly clean if it doesn’t exist. In other words, the only clean code is <a aria-label="no code (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">no code</a>. Let’s start with an acknowledgment that a perfectly clean (empty) codebase is useless. With that in mind, our pursuit of clean code will necessarily consist of tradeoffs. We’ll trade usefulness for cleanliness, complexity for speed, ownership for ease of development, and abstractions for reusability.</p>
<p>DRY (don’t repeat yourself) code is often held aloft as an ideal in the quest for clean code. Before we jump in too deep, let me shamelessly plug my new computer science learning platform <a href="https://qvault.io/">Qvault</a>, check it out if you like CS and like to write code. With that over with, let’s explore why I think DRY can be a good <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/11/30/examples-of-heuristics-in-computer-science/">heuristic</a>, but far from an absolute.</p>
<h2>What is DRY Code?</h2>
<p>According to <a aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Don’t repeat yourself</strong>&nbsp;is a principle aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns,&nbsp;replacing it with abstractions or using&nbsp;data normalization&nbsp;to avoid redundancy. Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.</p></blockquote>
<p>While this definition is fairly exhaustive, what I’ve found people <em>usually</em> mean when they say “DRY code” is that when you find yourself repeating pieces of logic you should instead create a reusable function, interface, class, etc, so that you only have to maintain one copy of it. For example, take the following API calls:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">export async function updateUserHandle(handle) {
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  return await fetch(`${domain}/v1/users/handle`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      handle
    })
  });
}

export async function updateUserInterests(interestUUIDs) {
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  return await fetch(`${domain}/v1/users/interests`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      interestUUIDs
    })
  });
}</code></pre>
<p>You may have noticed, but the beginning of those two API calls are nearly identical – they handle some basic logic that checks to see if the user is properly authenticated and sends that authentication in the request. This might not be a big deal with just two API calls, but what if we have 30? Or maybe 1000? Instead, we can DRY up this code by writing a simple <code>fetchWithAuth</code> function that will centralize all the client’s authentication logic in a single place:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">async function fetchWithAuth(url, params){
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  if (!params.headers){
    params.headers = {};
  }
  params.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  return await fetch(url, params);
}

export async function updateUserHandle(handle) {
  return await fetchWithAuth(`${domain}/v1/users/handle`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      handle
    })
  });
}

export async function updateUserInterests(interestUUIDs) {
  return await fetchWithAuth(`${domain}/v1/users/interests`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      interestUUIDs
    })
  });
}</code></pre>
<h2>Why wouldn’t you DRY out your code?</h2>
<p>Seems like a good idea to reduce code duplication right? Well, yes, in general it is. That said, lets look at some of the drawbacks that come along with too much centralization.</p>
<h3>1. Too many abstractions</h3>
<p>Sometimes code is the same at a given point in time, but later on, it becomes distinct in some way. It’s really hard to guarantee that duplicate code will remain perfect copies of each other forever. A hypothetical example of this would be if the Facebook and Instagram APIs had the exact same way to create a social post. Just because they’re <em>coincidentally</em> the same, probably doesn’t mean that the logic should only be written once.</p>
<p>The solution is likely to remain disciplined about splitting out code that, while it may be similar, is only <em>coincidentally</em> similar. Try to only merge code that’s <em>fundamentally</em> the same. A great example would be a math function like <code>log2</code>. That function should work for every case that you need to calculate a logarithm – each call is fundamentally the same.</p>
<h3>2. External dependency creation</h3>
<p>If two different projects share the same logic, it can often make sense to centralize it in a library package. While this is often a great idea, it can add overhead and can end up being more trouble than it’s worth. For example, even if the abstraction makes sense, you’re definitely adding at least the following complexity to the project:</p>
<ul><li>Management of the dependencies versions and running updates regularly</li><li>Requires multi-project updates in order to get a new change to a specific dependent</li><li>Often involves more remote infrastructure like NPM or PyPy</li><li>Gets harder to make “breaking” changes to the libraries core functions – requires a higher standard of code quality and architecture</li></ul>
<h3>3. Localization complexity</h3>
<p>When debugging or reading code, it would be easiest if the flow of logic started at the top of a file and flowed in a linear path. For example:</p>
<pre><code>START PROGRAM
INSTRUCTION 0
INSTRUCTION 1
INSTRUCTION 2
INSTRUCTION 3
END PROGRAM</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, in useful programs, we need functions, classes, methods, type definitions, etc. that force us to read and write code in a non-linear way. The goal should be to keep everything as linear as possible and sacrifice linearity and simplicity for reusability and separation of concerns as necessary. Every time we extract a chunk of code from a larger function into a smaller more encapsulated one, the code becomes just a little bit harder to follow.</p>
<p>With a highly compartmentalized project, when we see a function called <code>getUser</code>, if we want to <em>really</em> know what’s going on we have to peek into that function and remember the current context because we’re now looking at a different file. Obviously, the cognitive burden becomes greater and greater the more definitions you need to jump through.</p>
<h2>Takeaways – Code smells and hueristics</h2>
<p>Since no code is perfect, we can need to make use of some heuristics (rules of thumb), to try to work towards a cleaner codebase.</p>
<h3>1. WET code, or the rule of three</h3>
<p>WET is a better rule of thumb in my opinion than DRY.</p>
<p>WET stands for “write everything twice”, and forces you to think a bit harder about whether or not a piece of logic deserves an abstraction. The rule of three is an alternative that says you should even wait until you’ve written something three times before breaking it out.</p>
<h3>2. Is it testable?</h3>
<p>Most functions should be predictable and testable. They should behave like math functions or <a aria-label="pure functions (opens in a new tab)" href="https://qvault.io/2020/09/07/how-to-make-pure-functions-in-go/#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20Pure%20Function,of%20data%20outside%20the%20function)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pure functions</a> – given a set of inputs you’ll always receive the same outputs, and the state of the program isn’t mutated. If the code you’re thinking about condensing into a function can be a pure function, then it’s likely a better idea than if it were an impure function.</p>
<p>Pure functions are really easy to write good unit tests for – if your abstraction is easily testable it’s more likely to be a good abstraction.</p>
<h3>3. Are there special cases or arguments only used by a fraction of callers?</h3>
<p>Take a look at the following example:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getArea(height, width){
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>This is a great function! Its very simple, and obviously can be used to calculate the area of any shape. Here’s a bad example:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getArea(height, width, isTriangle){
  if (isTriangle){
    return (height * width) / 2
  }
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>Special cases are bad news – I’m trying to be too abstract. Instead I should just create two separate functions:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getTriangleArea(height, width){
  return (height * width) / 2
}

function getRectangleArea(height, width){

I’ve created a theme template and using Hugo I can easily generate a complete website. The generated website is then uploaded to a public B2 cloud bucket. Access to the website hosted in the B2 bucket is then provided through Cloudflare.</p><p>Taking advantage of the bandwidth alliance between B2 and Cloudflare gives free outbound bandwidth from B2 and inexpensive storage of your data. Currently B2 cloud charges $5 per month for 1TB of data and up to 10GB for free. Cloudflare workers are free up to 100,000 daily requests then it’s $5 per month for a few million requests and an additional 50 cents per million requests. This means the website can serve millions of requests per month for less than $10 per month.</p><h4 id="creating-the-website-bucket">Creating the website bucket</h4><p>After creating an account on B2 cloud create a new bucket and enable public access. Create an application key and give it access to the newly created bucket. Note down the application key and ID as they will be needed in the following steps.</p><h4 id="creating-the-hugo-website">Creating the Hugo website</h4><p>Hugo is a powerful static site generation tool with a large community and many free themes available. It has a powerful template engine and content management tools.</p><p>I created this websites current theme using Hugo templates and found it very enjoyable once I got more familiar with Hugo template order precedence.</p><p>Once the Hugo static website is ready you can build the static files with the <code>hugo</code> command. This generates the HTML files from the templates and content into a public directory.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">❯ hugo

In order to match the routes created in the website we can use Cloudflare Workers to handle the inbound requests. This also gives the ability to modify the request to remove some B2 debugging headers and do some error handling such as serving the 404.html page.</p><p>You will need to configure a domain in Cloudflare for the website. Then create a new worker and routes to send requests to the domain to the worker. Configure the domain with a CNAME record pointing to the domain of the B2 bucket.</p><p><img src="https://roote.ca/about/tutorials/static-site/cloudflare_static.png" alt="Cloudflare DNS setting"></p><p>In the site configuration page rules section ensure cache level is set to everything and automatic HTTPS rewrites are enabled.</p><p><img src="https://roote.ca/about/tutorials/static-site/cloudflare_page_rules.png" alt="Cloudflare Page Rules"></p><p>I’ve based the worker code off of this great example found <a href="https://jross.me/free-personal-image-hosting-with-backblaze-b2-and-cloudflare-workers/">here.</a> Using this code with some small modifications allows you to use B2 as the web server with full caching in the Cloudflare network.</p><p>I’ve made some modifications to allow serving the index.html page without specifying it directly as one limitation of B2 cloud is that there isn’t a concept of an index page for HTTP requests. I’ve also added some checks to see if the request to B2 gives a 404 error, if so it will return the 404 page included with the website. This prevents a user from seeing the 404 page directly from the B2 cloud bucket.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>'use strict'</span>;

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
		Share </p><p>Early my career, a CFO asked me a very good question. “If IT can’t deliver a return on investment that is better than what I could get by putting corporate monies into a bank savings account, then why would I want to invest in IT?”</p>
<p>At the time, I didn’t have a good answer. In fact, I was a bit embarrassed. But looking back, I realize that he was absolutely right.</p>
<p>Is your IT organization delivering a good return on investment? Or is your IT organization being silently killed?</p>
<h2><strong>Where does IT spend the business’ money?</strong></h2>
<p>If I look at the broad categories of IT spend, there are three categories where IT spends the business’ money:</p>
<p><strong>KTLO</strong>, or <strong>K</strong>eeping <strong>T</strong>he <strong>L</strong>ights <strong>O</strong>n, can be thought of as the cost of doing business. All other things remaining equal, KTLO is spend that typically fluctuates little on a year to year basis. This category includes spending on things like support contracts, salaries, training, regulatory and legal compliance, and maintenance and support activities to keep current systems running optimally.</p>
<p><strong>Innovation</strong> represents investments in technology. This type of spend includes initiatives like new systems, new lines of business, technology enablement of new business products, mergers and acquisitions, or significant expansions of existing services. This can be thought of as “grow the business” or “transform the business” kinds of spend.</p>
<p>What is the third category of IT spending?</p>
<p><strong>Break-fix. </strong>Break-fix represents spending related to failed changes. Recurring incidents. Major incidents. Failed deployments. Re-work. Poor quality.</p>
<p>When technology breaks, or changes fail, or an issue occurs that interrupts the business’ ability to do business, IT must stop whatever it is doing and fix the issue. Granted, some (hopefully limited) number of outages and failures should be expected. After all, technology ages and at some point, may fail. Business situations emerge in ways that software was perhaps not designed to manage. The bottom line is that when things break, IT has to fix what’s broken.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing. Regardless of whether IT is spending its time KTLO, innovating, or fixing, it<em> all pays the same</em>. To say it differently, an organization’s IT personnel are paid the same, regardless of what they’re working on.</p>
<p>Here’s the other thing. CFOs expect IT to deliver within its annual budget. IT doesn’t get more budget money to spend, just because it’s spending more money “fixing” rather than “innovating”.</p>
<p>If you’re the CFO, where would you like to see IT spending its time? Certainly not on “break-fix”.</p>
<h2><strong>What is the impact?</strong></h2>
<p>What happens when fixing issues and constant rework becomes (nearly) a way of life for the IT organization?</p>
<p>Well, two things.</p>
<p>First, remember those innovation projects that had been planned? When IT spends more time on “fixing”, those innovation projects get broken out into subprojects in the hopes of getting “something” rather than “nothing” done. Or they get delayed until the next budget cycle.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or they get outsourced to someone else. Or they don’t get done at all. Why? Because IT is too busy with rework and fixing, it has no time to work on the innovation that the business requested.</p>
<p>Second, the reputation and credibility of the IT organization become damaged. While some in IT may be (briefly) recognized for their <a href="https://www.dougtedder.com/2015/05/02/we-dont-need-another-hero/">heroic efforts</a> in “putting out the fires”, the longer-term damage is being done. IT becomes perceived as being too reactive, inconsistent, incompetent, and unreliable.</p>
<h2><strong>Are the silent killers evident at your IT organization?</strong></h2>
<p>I just finished reading “The Art of Business Value” by Mark Schwartz<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>. In the book, Schwartz described the abstracted total of IT capabilities for many organizations – software, infrastructure, the whole bit – as a giant hairball. This giant hairball is continually getting new pieces stuck to it – and not all of it pretty. The hairball clearly has value to the organization – it enables the business! – but the hairball is continually becoming more and more difficult to manage.</p>
<p>And, in my opinion, it’s this hairball that is silently killing IT.</p>
<p>“Break-fix” is just one thing that is silently killing IT. What are some other silent killers?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uneven effort</strong>. There are often overlapping efforts by those in IT – multiple people doing similar activities. Or even worse – there are gaps in effort. Things that should be getting done, but are not.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of transparency</strong>. No one is able to identify what happens to investments in IT. No one can adequately describe the value proposition of IT. All the business knows is that it spends monies on IT. It’s not consistently clear of what is coming out of IT.</li>
<li><strong>Increased spending in KTLO</strong>. Because systems aren’t being retired, or new applications or technologies are continually being bolted-on to legacy systems, the cost just to keep the lights on rises from year to year.</li>
<li><strong>Inability to respond </strong>to changing business needs in a timely fashion. IT is unable to deploy new or updated technology in the timeframes or in a manner required by business.</li>
<li><strong>IT personnel lack business acumen</strong>. IT people think and talk only in terms of “bits and bytes” and have no ability to relate technology efforts to business outcomes and value.</li>
<li><strong>Avoidance</strong>. From the business perspective, it’s too darn difficult to do business with IT. So, the business doesn’t invite IT to strategy discussions. “Shadow” technology projects pop up within business areas, or aspects of technology use are outsourced.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Silencing the Silent Killers</strong></h2>
<p>IT organizations are complex and ever-evolving. And while all of the current talk of IT needing to be more agile and responsive is well and good, the fact remains that most IT organizations are stuck grooming a hairball. And it’s that hairball that is killing the IT organization.&nbsp;&nbsp; What can the IT organization do?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Define the service portfolio</strong>. Identify and capture the business outcomes, total cost of ownership, needed resources, and business value of what IT does in the service portfolio. Not only will this illustrate how technology provides business value, it will also help identify areas of technical debt and help with informed decision-making regarding the use of technology within the organization.</li>
<li><strong>Develop business acumen</strong>. Understanding the business of the business – and the contribution that technology makes to the business – is critical for survival of the IT organization. Talk with business colleagues in business terms!</li>
<li><strong>Formally define processes</strong>. If there ever was anything close to a silver bullet for IT challenges, having defined processes might just be it. First, defined processes help IT understand what is to be done and by whom. Defined processes document and enable flow. Lastly, defined processes enable automation, which helps IT become more responsive to business demands.</li>
<li><strong>Make regular payments on technical debt</strong>. Unabated, the IT hairball will only become worse. IT must dedicate focused efforts to pay down the organization’s technical debt. This should include activities such as kaizens, re-architecting systems from being monolithic to being more modular, and allocating part of all new project spend toward retirement (and shutdown) of non-necessary legacy systems.</li>
<li><strong>Unleash your “inner salesperson”</strong>. If you’re unable to promote the value of IT, you can’t expect anyone outside of IT to perceive value. Continually sell the value proposition of the IT organization.&nbsp;&nbsp; Be able to answer why investment in IT is a good thing for the organization. What will your CFO see as the return in the investment of the business’ monies into IT?</li>
</ul>
<p>What makes the silent killers of IT so dangerous is the fact that IT organizations don’t recognize them…until it is too late. Don’t let your IT organization fall victim to these silent killers. My five actions for stopping the silent killers will help IT demonstrate a good return on investment for the business.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Every novice Pythonista is familiar with the trusty built-in function <code>print()</code>. Its job is simple: output the string representation of an object or expression.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'the answer is'</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>
<span>'the answer is 3'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>But let’s say you want to change the behavior of print. Instead of sending its output to the terminal, let’s send that output to a file on the disk. We can accomplish this by redefining the print variable.</p>



<p>The full function signature of print is:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>objects</span><span>,</span> <span>sep</span><span>=</span><span>' '</span><span>,</span> <span>end</span><span>=</span><span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>file</span><span>=</span><span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>stdout</span><span>,</span> <span>flush</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Note the third keyword argument, <code>file</code>. The default value of <code>file</code> is <code>sys.stdout</code>, which represents the terminal output buffer. The only real requirement for the object passed to <code>file</code> is that it has a <code>.write()</code> method. You know what has a write method? File handlers.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'log.txt'</span><span>,</span> <span>'a+'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span># f is a file handler
</span>    <span>f</span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>'the answer is'</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s redefine the print variable to instead be a wrapper function around the vanilla built-in <code>print()</code>. The wrapped <code>print()</code> needs to be referenced through the <code>builtins</code> module so that we don’t define a recursive function.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> <span>builtins</span>

<span>def</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>):</span>
    <span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'log.txt'</span><span>,</span> <span>'a+'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>builtins</span><span>.</span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>file</span><span>=</span><span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>)</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'the answer is'</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, when we call <code>print()</code>, no output is displayed in the terminal. However, if we read the contents of <code>log.txt</code>, we can see that our redefined <code>print()</code> has written to the file.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>$ </span><span>cat </span>log.txt
the answer is 3</code></pre></figure>



<p>Let’s make it weird. We can actually redefine <code>print()</code> to be a buffer object that stores all the strings that are passed to it for printing. Instead of a function, <code>print</code> will be an instance of a class that inherits <code>io.StringIO</code>.</p>

<p><code>StringIO</code> is a in-memory text buffer that works similarly to a file handler. In fact, file handlers and <code>StringIO</code> both implement the abstract base class <code>IOBase</code>, which means they have many of the same methods defined.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple example of how to use <code>StringIO</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> <span>io</span>

<span>buffer</span> <span>=</span> <span>io</span><span>.</span><span>StringIO</span><span>()</span>
<span>buffer</span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>'here is some input'</span><span>)</span>
<span>buffer</span><span>.</span><span>getvalue</span><span>()</span>
<span>'here is some input'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s define a new subclass of <code>StringIO</code> called <code>PrintWrapper</code>. We’re also going to define a <code>__call__</code> magic method on this new class. <code>__call__</code> allows you to define how an instance of a class behaves when it is called like a function.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> <span>builtins</span>
<span>import</span> <span>io</span>

<span>class</span> <span>PrintWrapper</span><span>(</span><span>io</span><span>.</span><span>StringIO</span><span>):</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>__call__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>):</span>
    <span># Pass the object instance (self) as the file
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>builtins</span><span>.</span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>file</span><span>=</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>)</span>

<span>print</span> <span>=</span> <span>PrintWrapper</span><span>()</span> <span># print is now the printer AND a buffer
</span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'this was added to buffer'</span><span>)</span>  <span># triggers print.__call__()
</span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'this was also added to the buffer'</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>.</span><span>getvalue</span><span>()</span>
<span>'this was added to buffer</span><span>\n</span><span>this was also added to buffer</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Strings that you have printed are seperated by <code>\n</code> when you call print.getvalue(), but you can define a different seperator by passing it as a string to the <code>end=</code> keyword argument of <code>builtins.print()</code>.</p>



<p>Why would you ever want to do any of this? Well, let’s say you are building a web-based programming environment like <a href="https://coderpad.io/">CoderPad</a>. When a user calls <code>print()</code>, you probably wouldn’t want the Python interpreter running on the server to send the printed statement to stdout. You might instead want it to be outputted to a handler that transmits it to the user’s browser over the Internet. There are probably other ways to accomplish this, but redefining <code>print()</code> behind the scenes is one possibility.</p>

<p>This is the first of a series of blog entries I’m calling “baby snakes”, bits of Python arcana aimed at intermediate and advanced Python developers. Please check back soon for more!</p>

How to make it more sustainable?</p><div><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/iter_fusion_reactor_plasma.jpg" alt="Figure 1: Inside the Korean tokamak KSTAR (NFRI)"><figcaption><p>Figure 1: Inside the Korean tokamak <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KSTAR">KSTAR</a> (NFRI)</p></figcaption></figure><p>With corporations like Microsoft, Oracle, and Google truly reinventing
themselves to adapt to an open source world, and typical open source
projects moving towards—oftentimes centralized—governance models, the
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/">Cathedral–Bazaar</a> dichotomy feels increasingly less relevant.</p><p>It was met with
<a href="https://firstmonday.org/article/view/708/618">criticism</a>
even back in the 90s.</p><p>While being an entertaining piece of history with useful takeaways, its
most important achievement was arguably helping create a sense of identity
for hacker culture via the revolutionary Open Source movement, and
promoting the value of the Internet for software development.</p><p>In the Cathedral-Bazaar continuum, contemporary projects like Kubernetes,
Chromium, and VSCode are <i>fusion reactors</i>.</p><p>They have the backing of heavily invested companies with virtually infinite
capital, who are able to staff highly competent teams that not only work
full-time on these projects, but also have enough personpower to maximally
leverage the benefits brought by a gigantic user base.</p><p>Like with fusion power, they seem to be able to leverage a high amount of
energy to generate even more.</p><p>Sometimes, their user base includes <i>other</i> organizations with
endless resources: by means of its success, VSCode is getting
<a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2019/11/21/fb-vs-code.aspx">sizable contributions</a> from Facebook, for example.</p><p>In contrast, the vast majority of open source projects depend almost
exclusively on decentralized volunteer efforts from people sacrificing time
out of their busy schedules and lives to move things forward.</p><p>And yet, projects following this style of development can end up becoming
backbones of modern computing:</p><blockquote><p>The OpenSSL project has been around since 1998. Since the project is open
source, it is an informal group comprised primarily of about a dozen
members throughout the world, most of whom have day jobs, and some of whom
work on a volunteer basis. Being open source, the OpenSSL project’s code
has always been public facing. Any person could download it and modify it
or implement it in their own software.</p><p>[…]</p><p>The fascinating, mind-boggling fact here is that you have this critical
piece of network infrastructure that really runs a large part of the
internet, and there’s basically one guy working on it full time.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/articles/ssl-heartbleed">Steve Marquess in “It’s Not A Fun Week To Work at OpenSSL, The Mostly
Volunteer Project Responsible for the Heartbleed Bug”, (2014)</a></p></blockquote><p>Heartbleed is a symptom of an ever-existing problem: corporations profit
massively by leveraging typically under-resourced open source projects
while not giving back proportionally, or (most commonly) at all; either
with money or people.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/xkcd_load_bearing_open_source.png" alt="Figure 2: &amp;ldquo;Load-Bearing Internet People&amp;rdquo;"><figcaption><p>Figure 2: <a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/">“Load-Bearing Internet People”</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>After Heartbleed the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Infrastructure_Initiative">Core Infrastructure Initiative</a>
was created to support software essential to the "functioning of the
Internet and other major information systems".</p><p>Less critical software like Emacs also follows this decentralized
development style, and similarly, lacks resources.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>So if Emacs wants to compete with these tools then it has to have
seamless, context aware code completion and refactoring support, and GNU
tools has to provide Emacs the necessary information to implement these
features.</p></blockquote><p>I agree. But to have that, the only way is to have motivated volunteers
step forward and work on these features. Otherwise we will never have them.</p><p>Right now, no one is working on that, though everyone is talking. [T]he
same as with weather.</p><p>— <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-10/msg00646.html">Eli Zaretskii in “Re: IDE” (2014)</a></p></blockquote><p>One way to incentivize contributions is by funding developers. Some (most?)
open source contributors would gladly take income to fund their work.</p><blockquote><p>Long-term my big dream has always been to accumulate enough backing to be
able to work full-time on open-source projects, but whether I’ll achieve
this dream or not is entirely up to you.</p><p>— <a href="https://emacsredux.com/blog/2020/09/13/patronage-revisited/">Bozhidar Batsov in “Patronage Revisited” (2020)</a></p></blockquote><p>While others feel that accepting funding would degrade their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:%5FThe%5FSurprising%5FTruth%5FAbout%5FWhat%5FMotivates%5FUs">intrinsic
motivation</a> to contribute.</p><blockquote><p>I can’t speak for all FLOSS developers, but I can speak for myself: I don’t
want monetary rewarding from users. Mainly for the reason, that I don’t
want to change the relationship with my users. Currently it is mostly a
team attitude, we’re working together to solve the problem. And there is
also no legal obligation for me to work on something I don’t like.</p><p>If I accepted contributions I think many users would get a “but I paid for
that, so do what I want” attitude. I definitely don’t want that. I do FLOSS
in my free time to do something that matters, and for my personal
fulfillment, not for money.</p><p>It will also get harder to do the right thing (in contrary to doing what
the users want) since the users can stop the payments.</p><p>So, no payments for me, thanks.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/6pjbn0/sustainable%5Femacs%5Fdevelopment%5Fsome%5Fthoughts%5Fand/">cjk101010 in “Sustainable Emacs development - some thoughts and
analysis” (2017)</a></p></blockquote><p>Which is fair: with compensation comes responsibility, timelines,
expectations, and things can get complicated. From the point of view of the
project, there doesn’t seem to be a conflict: capture funding to enable those
who need (or want) it, while still empowering those who don’t, to contribute
on their own terms.</p><p>Not everyone is in a position to spend unpaid time on open source,
especially consistently. “Free” time <a href="https://www.rightattitudes.com/2017/08/08/opportunity-cost/">isn’t free</a>—<em>it costs life</em>. By
funding work, a project might get to see contributions from talented folks
passionate about it who wouldn’t be able to volunteer their time.</p><p>And sometimes, the reason why your PR isn't getting immediate attention
is that the maintainer is busy literally
<a href="https://github.com/fre5h/DoctrineEnumBundle/pull/12#issuecomment-33023169">fighting</a>
a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_of_Dignity">revolution</a>.</p><p>For Emacs specifically, one problem is that there’s no clear way of funding
“Emacs”. Sending money to the FSF doesn’t guarantee that it will fund Emacs
development. <em>Even if there was</em> a way of “funding Emacs”, the Emacs
community—like many things in life—seems to be roughly divided in two
sides: those who prioritize <em><a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">freedom</a></em>, and those who prioritize <em>progress</em>. So
one would potentially want to fund one side or the other, depending on their
values.</p><p>In the excellent “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0578675862/">Working in Public</a>: The Making and Maintenance of Open
Source Software”, Nadia Eghbal calls attention to a shift in how
individuals support open source. Similarly to platforms like Twitch, more
and more people are funding creators directly instead of projects, as a way
of “incentivizing the ongoing creation of creative work” from developers
who produce things that are in their interests.</p><p>Maintainers of popular Emacs packages, for example, have their own <a href="https://github.com/tarsius/elisp-maintainers">separate
streams of patronage</a>, which receive varying levels of support depending on
their popularity and the value added by what they create.</p><p>For efforts that involve multiple people, like maintaining and evolving
Emacs itself, services like <a href="https://opencollective.com/">Open Collective</a> could be of great assistance by
helping on three fronts:</p><ol><li>providing a legal banking entity</li><li>recurrently collecting funds from individuals and companies</li><li>distributing funds to contributors</li></ol><p>Funds can be transparently collected, and dispersed for specific contract
work, infrastructure costs, and even developer salaries. Take for example
the <a href="https://opencollective.com/babel">Babel</a> project, which draws in enough recurrent income to finance
multiple contractors and a full-time developer earning a San Francisco
salary. An Emacs Open Collective could not only be an answer to “how can I
fund Emacs development?” but also a way to financially support developers
working on it.</p><p>The Clojure community seems to be doing an excellent job at not only
<a href="https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/q4-2020-funding-announcement/">funding</a>
efforts that are making the whole Clojure ecosystem
better but also at surveying and
<a href="https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/q3-2020-survey-results/">responding</a>
accordingly to user
feedback.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors">GitHub Sponsors</a> is another great example of developer empowerment. With it,
not only does GitHub equip people to:</p><ul><li>be more productive by providing great code hosting, bug tracking, wiki,
code reviewing and merging, project management, continuous integration,
documentation, artifact hosting, etc.</li><li>have a broader impact by giving projects more visibility and standardized
workflows that are familiar to others already on the platform</li></ul><p>It also makes it possible for its <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">40 million users</a> to frictionlessly fund
work on open source, and for a large number of maintainers to be
conveniently compensated for their labor. I just started sponsoring someone
with literally two clicks!</p><p>The power of platforms can’t be understated.</p><p>Whether you like GitHub or not, it’s undeniable that it has, and continues
to revolutionize Open Source, simply by providing a significantly better
and unified experience for all aspects of building software.</p><div><p>When there are people making over
<a href="https://changelog.com/posts/i-just-hit-100000-per-year-on-github-sponsors">100k/year</a>
on GitHub Sponsors, you better have a great reason to <b>not</b> try to
<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/neovim">take advantage</a>
of it.</p><p>In the case of Emacs, the reason is <i>freedom</i>.</p></div><p>I wouldn’t mind if Emacs development moved to GitHub, but <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/repo-criteria-evaluation.en.html">I don’t think
it’s ever going to happen</a>. Maybe for good reason: GitHub is backed by a
for-profit corporation and is far from perfect, both in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906213/github-ice-microsoft-software-email-contract-immigration-nonprofit-donation">moral</a> and <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc">technical</a>
terms. It might be a great tool today, but being a proprietary platform,
its users are at their complete mercy.</p><p>I should point out that from my perspective GitHub has been for the
most part a force for
<a href="https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/">good</a>.</p><p>It would be great if main development at least moved from a
mailing-list-driven process to a modern <em>forge</em> style of contribution. It
<a href="https://emba.gnu.org/emacs/emacs">seems that it <em>might</em></a>, but whether or not it will is still <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/28152">unclear</a>.</p><p>In the same way that corporations extract value out of open source, open
source projects should as much as possible leverage “energy” generated by
corporations. In this new open source world, companies have their workforce
contributing millions of person-hours to projects that benefit everyone.
LLVM equips people to build programming languages. LSP gives people potent
software development capabilities. Rails empowers people to build powerful
web applications.</p><blockquote><p>More than 3,000 people have committed man-decades, maybe even
man-centuries, of work for free. Buying all that effort at market rates
would have been hundreds of millions of dollars. Who would have been able
to afford funding that?</p><p>That’s a …</p></blockquote></div></div>

      <p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> is a great resource. However, I seemed to constantly run into two issues. 1. If I didn't visit at least once a day, top items would scroll off the top pages and I would never see them. 2. If I was procrastinating and visiting the page often, I would find it difficult to determine what was new on the page. That frustration led to <b><a href="https://hckrnews.com/">hckr news</a></b>, a chronologic list of items that have made it onto the Hacker News homepage.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>With more and more content being hosted on GitHub it's a shame that you can't get notified when a particular file has changed. At least not by GitHub, that is. But you can build your own notification service. Here is how.</p> <picture> <source srcset="https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2020/12/githubwatch-notification.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2020/12/githubwatch-notification.png" alt="Adaptive card with a notification about a changed file on GitHub displayed in Microsoft Teams"> </picture> <h2>More than source control</h2> <p>GitHub is more than just the place where developers post their code. Over the last few years, it evolved also into a huge repository of content published through blogs and docs. For many, it's the go-to place to stay up-to-date on what's new.</p> <p>While GitHub offers us a way to get notified of changes to repos, the notifications options are limited. You can get notified of new releases or pull requests, but you can't get notified when a particular file has changed. With many devs using specific pages for announcing releases or keeping their changelog, being able to get notified of changes to these specific files, allows you to stay up-to-date on what's new and what's coming.</p> <h2>Build your own GitHub file changes notifier</h2> <p>To build your own GitHub file changes notifier, all you need is an <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azure subscription</a>. In the subscription, you will create a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/?WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">function app</a>, a <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/storage/?WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage account</a> and a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/?WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">logic app</a>. Here is the high-level of the solution architecture:</p> <picture> <source srcset="https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2020/12/githubwatch-diagram.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2020/12/githubwatch-diagram.png" alt="Diagram showing architecture of the solution"> </picture> <p>The storage account holds the list of files to check for changes. For each file, you will store its URL, title - for use with notifications, and a hash of its contents used to determine if the file has changed since the last time.</p> <p>The function app hosts the scheduled process that at the specified time retrieves the list of files from the storage account (1), iterates through them, for each (2) one checks if it changed and sends a notification if it did (3). If the file has changed, the function app also updates the file hash in the storage account (4).</p> <p>While there are unlimited ways to send a notification, I find using logic apps the easiest. Logic apps are extremely versatile and with just a few clicks you can set them up to receive notifications on Teams, via email, or on your phone, without having to deal with authentication, response handling, etc.</p> <h3>Set up a storage account</h3> <p>Start, by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal&amp;WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creating a storage account</a> in your resource group. In the storage account, create a table named <code>files</code>. For each file that you want to track, insert an item to the table including its <code>title</code> and <code>url</code>.</p> <picture> <source srcset="https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2020/12/githubwatch-insertentity.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2020/12/githubwatch-insertentity.png" alt="Table row showing information about a file on GitHub to monitor for changes"> </picture> <p>For each file, use the same partition key and a unique row key.</p> <h3>Create a logic app for sending notifications</h3> <p>In this example, we'll <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow?WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create a logic app</a> that sends a notification to the user on Microsoft Teams.</p> <p>In your resource group, create a logic app. Use the <strong>When a HTTP request is received</strong> trigger. As a sample payload, to generate the request schema specify:</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"abc"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"url"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"def"</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>Then, add the <strong>Post your own adaptive card as the Flow bot to a user</strong> action. Specify your email as the recipient. Choose two parameters: <strong>Message</strong> and <strong>Headline</strong>. In the <strong>Message</strong> parameter, enter:</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Let's walk through the different pieces of the script.</p> <h4>Load dependencies</h4> <p>Start, by loading the necessary dependencies:</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>axios</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>axios</span><span>'</span><span>).</span><span>default</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>crypto</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>crypto</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We'll use <strong>axios</strong> to execute web requests to download files and trigger notifications. <strong>axios</strong> makes it way easier than using the raw HTTP calls from Node.js. We also need the crypto functions so that we can calculate the hash for the downloaded file contents.</p> <h4>Reference input binding</h4> <p>Extend the function's function to include the <strong>Table parameter name</strong> you copied previously. This argument will contain all files that you've added to the storage account.</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>module</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>context</span><span>,</span> <span>timer</span><span>,</span> <span>inFilesTable</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <h4>Store information about changed files</h4> <p>Next, let's define two arrays for storing information about changed files:</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// array of files that have changed</span>
<span>const</span> <span>modifiedFiles</span> <span>=</span> <span>[];</span>
<span>// array of notifications</span>
<span>const</span> <span>modifiedFilesNotifications</span> <span>=</span> <span>[];</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We need two arrays because if we've just added a file to the storage account, its hash (<code>null</code>) will not match the hash retrieved from GitHub and would result in you getting a notification that the file has changed, while it's not quite the case. Storing information about the file that changed and files for which we should issue a notification allows avoiding the unnecessary initial notification.</p> <h4>Retrieve file contents</h4> <p>Then, let's retrieve contents of all files we're tracking:</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// retrieve file contents</span>
<span>const</span> <span>requests</span> <span>=</span> <span>inFilesTable</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>file</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><main><p>A single-threaded event loop like the one used by JavaScript and Node.js, makes it somewhat harder to have race conditions, but, SPOILER ALERT: race conditions are still possible!</p><p>In this article, we will explore the topic of race conditions in Node.js. We will discuss some examples and present a few different solutions that can help us to make our code <em>race condition free</em>.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-race-condition%3F">What is a race condition?</h2><p>First of all, let's try to clarify what a <em>race condition</em> actually is.</p><p>A race condition is a type of <em>programming error</em> that can occur when multiple processes or threads are accessing the same shared resource, for instance, a file on a file system or a record in a database, and at least one of them is trying to modify the resource.</p><p>Let's try to present an example. Imagine that while a thread is trying to rename a file, another thread is trying to delete the same file. In this case, the second thread will receive an error because, when it's trying to delete the file, the file has already been renamed. Or, the other way around, while one thread is trying to rename the file, the file was already deleted by the other thread and it's not available on the filesystem anymore.</p><p>In other cases, race conditions can be more subtle, because they wouldn't result in the program crashing, but they might just be the source of an incorrect or inconsistent behaviour. In these cases, since there is no explicit error and no stack trace, the issue is generally much harder to troubleshoot and fix.</p><p>A classic example is when 2 threads are trying to update the same data source and the new information is the result of a function applied to the current value.</p><p>Let's pretend we are building a Roman Empire simulation game in which we can manage some cash flow and we have a global balance in <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aureus"><em>aureus</em></a> (a currency used in the Roman Empire around 100 B.C.E.). Now, let's say that our initial balance is <code>0</code> <em>aurei</em> and that there are two independent game components (possibly running on separate threads) that are trying to increase the balance by <code>50</code> <em>aurei</em> each, we should expect that in the end, the balance is <code>100</code> <em>aurei</em>, right?</p><pre><code>0 + 50 + 50 = 100 ðŸ¤‘</code></pre><p>If we implement this in a naive way, we might have the two components performing three distinct operations each:</p><ol><li>Read the current value for <code>balance</code></li><li>Add <code>50</code> <em>aurei</em> to it</li><li>Save the resulting value into <code>balance</code></li></ol><p>Since the two components are running in parallel, without any synchronisation mechanism, the following case could happen:</p><span><picture><source type="image/png" srcset="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-64.png 64w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-128.png 128w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-256.png 256w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-512.png 512w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-2002.png 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-64.webp 64w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-128.webp 128w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-256.webp 256w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-512.webp 512w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-2002.webp 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="A race condition example showing 2 processes trying to update a balance" src="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-64.png" width="64" height="30"></picture></span><p>In the picture above you can see that <strong>Component 2</strong> ends up having a <em>stale</em> view of the balance: the balance gets changed by <strong>Component 1</strong> after <strong>Component 2</strong> has read the balance. For this reason, when <strong>Component 2</strong> performs its own update, it is effectively overriding any change previously made by <strong>Component 1</strong>. This is why we have a race condition: the two components are effectively racing to complete their own tasks and they might end up stepping onto each other's toes! This doesn't make <em>Julius</em> happy I am afraid...</p><p>One way to solve this problem is to isolate the 2 concurrent operations into <em>transactions</em> and make sure that there is only one transaction running at a given time. This idea might look like this:</p><span><picture><source type="image/png" srcset="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-64.png 64w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-128.png 128w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-256.png 256w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-512.png 512w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-2022.png 2022w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-64.webp 64w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-128.webp 128w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-256.webp 256w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-512.webp 512w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-2022.webp 2022w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="Fixing a race condition using a transaction" src="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-64.png" width="64" height="31"></picture></span><p>In the last picture, we are using transactions to make sure that all the steps of <strong>Component 1</strong> happen in order before all the steps of <strong>Component 2</strong>. This prevents any <em>stale read</em> and makes sure that every component always has an up to date view of the world before doing any change. You can stop holding your breath now, Julius!</p><p>In the rest of this article, we will zoom in more on race conditions in the context of Node.js and we will see some other approaches to deal with them.</p><h2 id="can-we-have-race-conditions-in-node.js%3F">Can we have race conditions in Node.js?</h2><p>It is a common misconception to think that Node.js does not have race conditions because of its single-threaded nature. While it is true that in Node.js you would not have multiple threads competing for resources, you might still end up with tasks belonging to different logical transactions being executed in an order that might result in <em>stale reads</em> and generate a race condition.</p><p>In the example that we illustrated above, we intentionally represented the various tasks (<em>read</em>, <em>increase</em> and <em>save</em>) as discrete units. Note how the system is never executing more than one task at the same time. This is a simple but accurate representation of how the Node.js event loop processes tasks on a single thread. Nonetheless, you can see that there might be situations where multiple logical transactions (e.g. multiple deposits) are scheduled concurrently on the event loop and the discrete tasks might end up being intermingled, which results in a race condition.</p><p>So... <strong>Yes</strong>, we can have race conditions in Node.js!</p><h2 id="a-node.js-example-with-a-race-condition">A Node.js example with a race condition</h2><p>Now, let's talk some code! Let's try to re-create the Roman Empire simulation game example that we discussed above.</p><p>In ancient Rome, Romans used to export olives and grapes. No wonder Italy is still famous worldwide for olive oil and wine! In our game, we want to be able to harvest olives and grapes and then sell them as a means to acquire more <em>aurei</em>.</p><p>We are going to have two functions that can increase the balance by <code>50</code> <em>aurei</em> which we are going to call <code>sellOlives()</code> and <code>sellGrapes()</code>. We will also assume that every time the balance is changed, it is persisted to a data storage of sort (e.g. a database). For the sake of this example, we won't be using a real data storage, but we will just simulate some random asynchronous delay before reading or modifying a global value. This will be enough to illustrate how we can end up with a race condition.</p><p>For starts, let's see what a buggy implementation might look like:</p><pre><code><br><br><span>const</span> <span>randomDelay</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span><span>(</span><span>resolve</span> <span>=&gt;</span><br>  <span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span>resolve<span>,</span> Math<span>.</span><span>random</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>100</span><span>)</span><br><span>)</span><p><br><br><span>let</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>0</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>loadBalance</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <br>  <span>await</span> <span>randomDelay</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  <span>return</span> balance<br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>saveBalance</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <br>  <span>await</span> <span>randomDelay</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  balance <span>=</span> value<br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>sellGrapes</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellGrapes - balance loaded: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br>  <span>const</span> newBalance <span>=</span> balance <span>+</span> <span>50</span><br>  <span>await</span> <span>saveBalance</span><span>(</span>newBalance<span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellGrapes - balance updated: </span><span><span>${</span>newBalance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>sellOlives</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellOlives - balance loaded: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br>  <span>const</span> newBalance <span>=</span> balance <span>+</span> <span>50</span><br>  <span>await</span> <span>saveBalance</span><span>(</span>newBalance<span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellOlives - balance updated: </span><span><span>${</span>newBalance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>main</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> transaction1 <span>=</span> <span>sellGrapes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>  <span>const</span> transaction2 <span>=</span> <span>sellOlives</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>  <span>await</span> transaction1 <br>                     <br>  <span>await</span> transaction2<br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Final balance: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></p></code></pre><p>If we execute this code we might end up with different results. In one case we might get the correct outcome:</p><pre><code>sellOlives - balance loaded: 0<br>sellOlives - balance updated: 50<br>sellGrapes - balance loaded: 50<br>sellGrapes - balance updated: 100<br>Final balance: 100</code></pre><p>But in other cases we might end up in a bad state:</p><pre><code>sellGrapes - balance loaded: 0<br>sellOlives - balance loaded: 0<br>sellGrapes - balance updated: 50<br>sellOlives - balance updated: 50<br>Final balance: 50</code></pre><p>Note how in this last case, <code>sellOlives</code> is essentially a stale read and therefore it will end up overriding the balance disregarding any work already done by <code>sellGrapes</code>. Yes, we do have a race condition, unfortunately!</p><p>Now, this example is simple ad it is not too hard to pinpoint exactly where the race condition has originated by just looking at the code.</p><p>Take a minute or two to read the code again. Check out the output from the 2 cases as well. Pay attention to the notes and the log messages and try to imagine how the Node.js runtime might execute this code in the 2 different scenarios.</p><p>Ok, now that you have done that, let's discuss together what happens.</p><p>In our <code>main</code> function, when we execute <code>sellGrapes()</code> and <code>sellOlives()</code>, since we are not awaiting the two operations independently, we are essentially scheduling both operations onto the event loop.</p><p>We only await the two transactions after they have been already scheduled, which means that they will work concurrently. After the two transactions have been scheduled, we wait for <code>transaction1</code> to complete and only then we wait for <code>transaction2</code> to complete. Note that <code>transaction2</code> might complete even before <code>transaction1</code>. In other words, awaiting for <code>transaction1</code> doesn't block <code>transaction2</code> in any way.</p><p>This approach is similar to writing the following code:</p><pre><code><span>await</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>sellGrapes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>sellOlives</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Using <code>Promise.all()</code> is a more commonly used way to schedule different tasks to run concurrently.</p><p>Note that with <code>Promise.all()</code>, the resulting promise will reject as soon as any of the promises rejects. In our previous example, since we await the two promises independently, we will always catch errors in <code>transaction1</code> before <code>transaction2</code>.</p><p>But let's not digress too much into this. Now that we understand the problem, how do we fix the race condition?</p><p>Well, it turns out that in this simple case, we might make things right quite easily:</p><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>main</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>await</span> <span>sellGrapes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>  <span>await</span> <span>sellOlives</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>                     <br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Final balance: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre><p>This implementation will consistently produce the following output:</p><pre><code>sellGrapes - balance loaded: 0<br>sellGrapes - balance updated: 50<br>sellOlives - balance loaded: 50<br>sellOlives - balance updated: 100<br>Final balance: 100</code></pre><p>As we can observe, <code>sellGrapes</code> is always started and completed <em>before</em> we start <code>sellOlives</code>. This makes the two logical transactions isolated and makes sure their tasks won't end up being mixed together in random order.</p><p>Problem solved... <em>vade in pacem</em> dear race condition!</p><h2 id="using-a-mutex-in-node.js">Using a mutex in Node.js</h2><p>OK, the previous example was illustrative, but if we are building a real game, chances are things will end up being a lot more complicated. We will probably end up having many different actions that might cause a change of balance. Those actions might be the result of a particular sequence of events and it might become hard to track down the discrete logical …</p></main></article></div>

  <p>I recently built a static website for a friend using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. We installed everything he needed to add content to his website on his laptop. And by all I mean just Hugo and Visual Studio Code. Then he reset his laptop and that set me thinking if we can do with even less, preferably installing nothing at all on his computer.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">GitHub Codespaces</a> came to mind. With GitHub Codespaces (currently in early access) we get a full VSCode powered development environment in the browser. Best of all it runs in an Ubuntu container giving terminal access, includes tools like Hugo out of the box and handles port forwarding for us.</p>
<p>There's something to be aware of with the automatic port forwarding and static assets such as images. So in this post I'll show how you can build and debug a static site built with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> in GitHub Codespaces.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>We'll first create an empty repository in GitHub. Make sure to add an empty README file, so we can easily open it with codespaces later on.</p>
<p><img src="https://shotor.com/blog/build-a-hugo-static-site-in-your-browser-using-github-codespaces/new-repository.png" alt="Create new repository with README"></p>
<p>Open GitHub Codespaces in the navigation bar.</p>
<p><img src="https://shotor.com/blog/build-a-hugo-static-site-in-your-browser-using-github-codespaces/codespaces.png" alt="Codespaces link in the GitHub navbar"></p>
<p>Then create a new Codespace by selecting our repository.</p>

<h2 id="hugo">Hugo</h2>
<p>Let's start with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. We'll run the commands of the <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Hugo quick start</a> with one modification. If you prefer to just look at the code, check out the <a href="https://github.com/shotor/hugo-codespaces-example">repository</a>.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># create a new site in the root folder, force it because it's not empty
</span><span>hugo</span><span> new site .</span><span> --force

</span><span># add ananke theme
</span><span>git</span><span> submodule add https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke

</span><span># set theme
</span><span>echo </span><span>'theme = "ananke"' </span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span> config.toml

</span><span># create new post
</span><span>hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
</span></code></pre>
<p>We'll add some content to our <code>my-first-post.md</code> file and also an image that we'll place in the <code>/static</code> folder (just drag it into the sidebar of your Codespace).</p>
<pre><code data-lang="md"><span>---
</span><span>title: 'My First Post'
date: 2021-01-24T12:00:00Z
</span><span>---

</span><span>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus in fringilla libero.

</span><span>![</span><span>Placeholder image</span><span>]</span><span>(</span><span>/image.png</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now we'll forward the port in the remote explorer tab. We know Hugo will run on 1313, so that's the port we will forward.</p>
<p><img src="https://shotor.com/blog/build-a-hugo-static-site-in-your-browser-using-github-codespaces/port-forward.png" alt="Our forwarded port"></p>
<p>Now if we just run Hugo (<code>hugo server -D</code>) our homepage will work fine. But any internal link or image will fail with a 404 error because it refers to localhost and not our GitHub url. And also there's a port included in all the links.</p>
<p>To fix this we run a modified start command where we set the <code>baseUrl</code> to the url provided by GitHub. We can get this url by right clicking on our forwarded port, and copying the url. We also need to disable the port section (in this case :1313). Our command becomes:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="sh"><span>hugo</span><span> server</span><span> -D --baseUrl</span><span>=</span><span>"https://your-github-url"</span><span> --appendPort</span><span>=</span><span>false
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now when we click on our first post, we'll see the blog post as well as the image we uploaded.</p>
<p>That's it, we now have a full development workflow completely in our browser. We can access it from anywhere to add content or make changes to the layout.</p>
<p>In this case we used Hugo, a static site generator. But this idea can be adapted to any type of webserver, for instance NodeJS or Django. As long as you bind the server to localhost and then forward the port. Making sure any internal links or images use the forwarded url as its base url.</p>
<h2 id="deployments-using-netlify">Deployments using Netlify</h2>
<p>To finish it off we'll add deployments using <a href="https://netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. We'll follow <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/">the Hugo tutorial</a> and create a <code>netlify.toml</code> file in the root directory.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="toml"><span>[</span><span>build</span><span>]

</span><span>HUGO_ENABLEGITINFO </span><span>= </span><span>"true"
</span></code></pre>
<p>Make sure we set the base url in <code>config.toml</code> to our Netlify url:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="toml"><span>baseURL </span><span>= </span><span>"https://pensive-sammet-17c943.netlify.app/"
</span><span>languageCode </span><span>= </span><span>"en-us"
</span><span>title </span><span>= </span><span>"Hugo Codespaces Example"
</span><span>theme </span><span>= </span><span>"ananke"
</span></code></pre>
<p>We can now commit and push all our changes. Which will trigger a build and deploy our static site. We can also create Pull Requests and have Netlify create preview environments for us, so we can test changes before merging them.</p>
<p>Our site is now live at <a href="https://pensive-sammet-17c943.netlify.app/">https://pensive-sammet-17c943.netlify.app/</a></p>
<p>All that's left to do is <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/">add a custom domain</a>.</p>
<h2 id="final-words">Final words</h2>
<p>Codespaces makes it really easy to work on projects hosted on GitHub.</p>
<p>There are limitations, the Ubuntu container doesn't allow you to run just any command you want, which makes sense.</p>
<p>For instance I tried to run a <a href="https://getzola.org/">Zola</a> project, but Zola requires <a href="https://snapcraft.io/">snapcraft</a>. Which is not included and cannot be installed in Codespaces. To get Zola working I had to upload the Zola binary file myself. No big deal, but on a local or a self-hosted remote vscode environment this is a non-issue.</p>
<p>Right now I'm only using it for small projects. I'm very interested to see how it holds up with bigger projects. In terms of size, as well things required from the operating system.</p>

                    <p>By Ryan Lambert -- Published January 23, 2021</p><p>Data quality is important.  This post continues exploring the
improved quality of OpenStreetMap data loaded to Postgres/PostGIS
<a href="https://github.com/rustprooflabs/pgosm-flex">via PgOSM-Flex</a>.
These improvements are enabled by the
<a href="https://osm2pgsql.org/doc/manual.html#the-flex-output">new flex output of osm2pgsql</a>,
making it easier to understand and consume OpenStreetMap data for
analytic purposes.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2020/12/osm2gpsql-flex-output-to-postgis">started exploring the Flex output</a>
a few weeks ago,
the <a href="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2021/01/postgis-openstreetmap-flex-structure">post before this one used PgOSM-Flex v0.0.3</a>.
This post uses PgOSM-Flex v0.0.7 and highlights a few cool improvements
by exploring the OSM place data.  Some of the improvements made of the past
few weeks were ideas brought over from the legacy PgOSM project.
Other improvements were spurred by questions and conversations with the
community, such as the
<a href="https://github.com/rustprooflabs/pgosm-flex/issues/37">nested admin polygons</a>.</p>
<h2>Improved places</h2>
<p>This post focuses on the <code>osm.place_polygon</code> data that stores things like
city, county and Country boundaries, along with neighborhoods and other details.
The the format of place data has a number of improvements covered in this post:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consolidated name</li>
<li>Remove duplication between relation/member polygons</li>
<li>Boundary hierarchy</li>
</ul>
<p>The data loaded for this post is the <a href="https://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/us-west.html">U.S. West sub-region</a> from
Geofabrik.  It was loaded using the <code>run-all.lua</code> and <code>run-all.sql</code> scripts
in
<a href="https://github.com/rustprooflabs/pgosm-flex">PgOSM-Flex</a>.</p>
<!--endteaser-->

<blockquote>
<p>This post is part of the series <a href="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2018/06/pg-series-toc"><em>PostgreSQL:  From Idea to Database</em></a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Consolidated Name</h2>
<p>There are a variety of name tags used throughout various OSM features,
such as <code>name</code>, <code>alt_name</code>, <code>short_name</code>, and so on.
Since not all features are tagged equally, the name cleanup implemented in 
<a href="https://github.com/rustprooflabs/pgosm-flex/blob/main/flex-config/helpers.lua">helpers.lua</a> attemps to catch the majority of the name tags used.
The <code>get_name(tags)</code>
function is used for the <code>name</code> column in every layer throughout PgOSM-Flex,
not just the place layers.</p>
<pre><code>function get_name(tags)
    if tags.name then
        return tags.name
    elseif tags.short_name then
        return tags.short_name
    elseif tags.alt_name then
        return tags.alt_name
    elseif tags.loc_name then
        ...
</code></pre>
<p>This query shows more than 4,500 roads that end up with a value in <code>name</code>
that otherwise be missing.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM osm.road_line r
    INNER JOIN osm.tags t
        ON t.geom_type = 'W' AND r.osm_id = t.osm_id
            AND t.tags-&gt;&gt;'name' IS NULL -- The main name tag is empty
    WHERE r.name IS NOT NULL -- The road has a name
;

â”‚  4585 â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>The above query takes advantage of the <code>osm.tags</code> table
that stores every feature with its full set of unaltered tag data.  <code>osm.tags</code> is the largest object loaded by PgOSM-Flex, considerable size can be saved by using <code>run-no-tags.lua</code> instead of <code>run-all.lua</code>.</p>
<p>Also, of note, is the use of <code>JSONB</code> instead of <code>HSTORE</code> throughout PgOSM-Flex.  The osm2pgsql project is still defaulting to <code>HSTORE</code> for legacy reasons.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Relations and Member Polygons</h2>
<p>Many administrative boundaries have multiple parts making up their complex
shapes.
This results in the full relation polygon and multiple sub-parts being loaded
into PostGIS. This query looking for Golden, CO returns two rows instead
of the expected one.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT osm_id, osm_type, boundary, admin_level, name, member_ids
    FROM osm.place_polygon p
    WHERE p.name = 'Golden'
    ORDER BY osm_id;
</code></pre>
<p>Note the the <code>osm_id</code> in the second row is listed in the
<code>member_ids</code> column of the first row.  The negative ID value
(<code>osm_id = -112204</code>) indicates that row is
<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/112204">a relation</a>
while the other is <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/33113240">a way</a>.</p>
<pre><code>â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”�

</code></pre>
<p>The legacy osm2pgsql process did not make it easy to remove the component
geometries, at least not that I found. When using this data for
analysis, this resulted in duplication that generally required manual cleanup.</p>
<p>The <code>member_ids</code> column shown above is pulled in during osm2pgsql processing
by the <a href="https://github.com/rustprooflabs/pgosm-flex/blob/main/flex-config/place.lua">place.lua</a> style. The tables get a new column defined:</p>
<pre><code>{ column = 'member_ids', type = 'jsonb'},
</code></pre>
<p>The processing uses the <code>way_member_ids()</code> function.</p>
<pre><code>local member_ids = osm2pgsql.way_member_ids(object)
</code></pre>
<p>The associated post-processing SQL script
(<a href="https://github.com/rustprooflabs/pgosm-flex/blob/main/flex-config/place.sql">place.sql</a>) creates a view <code>osm.places_in_relations</code> that is then
used to create the materialized view <code>osm.vplace_polygon</code>.</p>
<p>Querying <code>osm.vplace_polygon</code> only returns the one relation result for Golden, CO.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT osm_id, osm_type, boundary, admin_level, name, member_ids
    FROM osm.vplace_polygon p
    WHERE p.name = 'Golden'

<h2>Nested places</h2>
<p>Nested places refers to administrative boundaries that are contained, or 
contain, other administrative boundaries. An example of this is the
State of Colorado contains the boundary for Jefferson County, Colorado.
Determining these hierarchical structures can be accomplished in PostGIS using 
spatial joins, using
<a href="https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Contains.html"><code>ST_Contains()</code></a>
or
<a href="https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Within.html"><code>ST_Within()</code></a>.
An example of a query using <code>ST_Within</code>() is below.</p>
<pre><code>EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, VERBOSE)
SELECT cn.*
    FROM osm.vplace_polygon st -- State  
    INNER JOIN osm.vplace_polygon cn -- County
        ON ST_Within(cn.geom, st.geom) AND cn.admin_level::INT = 6
    WHERE st.name = 'Colorado'
;
</code></pre>
<p>My laptop runs this query in 57 ms (22 ms planning + 54 ms execution).
The <code>EXPLAIN</code> <a href="https://explain.depesz.com/s/PK9V">output shows</a>
the spatial index scan is the most time consuming step, taking more than 40 ms.</p>
<pre><code>Index Scan using gix_osm_vplace_polygon ... (actual time=3.497..43.628 rows=69 loops=1)
</code></pre>
<p>A screenshot to visualize the results from the above query because
pictures are nice.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot from DBeaver showing the Colorado county polygons in blue over the Stamen Mono basemap." src="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/static/images/osm-counties-in-colorado-stamen-mono-basemap.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note:  An astute reader may notice the <code>name</code> column is not indexed, indicated by the <code>Seq Scan</code> portion of the plan.  The <code>Seq Scan</code> took 9 ms, replacing it with an index scan reduced that step (and the overall query) by only 4-5 ms.  As the next section shows, this still falls short on performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Prepare the nested data</h3>

The columns <code>nest_level</code>, <code>name_path</code>, <code>osm_id_path</code> and <code>admin_level_path</code>

This process runs really fast on small regions (e.g. Colorado) but can take quite a while (&gt; 1 hour) on larger regions (Europe).

<p>This calculates the nesting of each row in small batches, default batch size 100. After each batch runs it is committed.
Once all rows have processed, the final steps calculate a boolean <code>innermost</code> 
column to easily identify boundaries
that do not contain other boundaries, e.g. the narrowest, most …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><main><p>A single-threaded event loop like the one used by JavaScript and Node.js, makes it somewhat harder to have race conditions, but, SPOILER ALERT: race conditions are still possible!</p><p>In this article, we will explore the topic of race conditions in Node.js. We will discuss some examples and present a few different solutions that can help us to make our code <em>race condition free</em>.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-race-condition%3F">What is a race condition?</h2><p>First of all, let's try to clarify what a <em>race condition</em> actually is.</p><p>A race condition is a type of <em>programming error</em> that can occur when multiple processes or threads are accessing the same shared resource, for instance, a file on a file system or a record in a database, and at least one of them is trying to modify the resource.</p><p>Let's try to present an example. Imagine that while a thread is trying to rename a file, another thread is trying to delete the same file. In this case, the second thread will receive an error because, when it's trying to delete the file, the file has already been renamed. Or, the other way around, while one thread is trying to rename the file, the file was already deleted by the other thread and it's not available on the filesystem anymore.</p><p>In other cases, race conditions can be more subtle, because they wouldn't result in the program crashing, but they might just be the source of an incorrect or inconsistent behaviour. In these cases, since there is no explicit error and no stack trace, the issue is generally much harder to troubleshoot and fix.</p><p>A classic example is when 2 threads are trying to update the same data source and the new information is the result of a function applied to the current value.</p><p>Let's pretend we are building a Roman Empire simulation game in which we can manage some cash flow and we have a global balance in <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aureus"><em>aureus</em></a> (a currency used in the Roman Empire around 100 B.C.E.). Now, let's say that our initial balance is <code>0</code> <em>aurei</em> and that there are two independent game components (possibly running on separate threads) that are trying to increase the balance by <code>50</code> <em>aurei</em> each, we should expect that in the end, the balance is <code>100</code> <em>aurei</em>, right?</p><pre><code>0 + 50 + 50 = 100 ðŸ¤‘</code></pre><p>If we implement this in a naive way, we might have the two components performing three distinct operations each:</p><ol><li>Read the current value for <code>balance</code></li><li>Add <code>50</code> <em>aurei</em> to it</li><li>Save the resulting value into <code>balance</code></li></ol><p>Since the two components are running in parallel, without any synchronisation mechanism, the following case could happen:</p><span><picture><source type="image/png" srcset="https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-64.png 64w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-128.png 128w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-256.png 256w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-512.png 512w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-2002.png 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-64.webp 64w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-128.webp 128w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-256.webp 256w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-512.webp 512w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-2002.webp 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="A race condition example showing 2 processes trying to update a balance" src="https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-64.png" width="64" height="30"></picture></span><p>In the picture above you can see that <strong>Component 2</strong> ends up having a <em>stale</em> view of the balance: the balance gets changed by <strong>Component 1</strong> after <strong>Component 2</strong> has read the balance. For this reason, when <strong>Component 2</strong> performs its own update, it is effectively overriding any change previously made by <strong>Component 1</strong>. This is why we have a race condition: the two components are effectively racing to complete their own tasks and they might end up stepping onto each other's toes! This doesn't make <em>Julius</em> happy I am afraid...</p><p>One way to solve this problem is to isolate the 2 concurrent operations into <em>transactions</em> and make sure that there is only one transaction running at a given time. This idea might look like this:</p><span><picture><source type="image/png" srcset="https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-64.png 64w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-128.png 128w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-256.png 256w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-512.png 512w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-2022.png 2022w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-64.webp 64w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-128.webp 128w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-256.webp 256w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-512.webp 512w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-2022.webp 2022w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="Fixing a race condition using a transaction" src="https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-64.png" width="64" height="31"></picture></span><p>In the last picture, we are using transactions to make sure that all the steps of <strong>Component 1</strong> happen in order before all the steps of <strong>Component 2</strong>. This prevents any <em>stale read</em> and makes sure that every component always has an up to date view of the world before doing any change. You can stop holding your breath now, Julius!</p><p>In the rest of this article, we will zoom in more on race conditions in the context of Node.js and we will see some other approaches to deal with them.</p><h2 id="can-we-have-race-conditions-in-node.js%3F">Can we have race conditions in Node.js?</h2><p>It is a common misconception to think that Node.js does not have race conditions because of its single-threaded nature. While it is true that in Node.js you would not have multiple threads competing for resources, you might still end up with tasks belonging to different logical transactions being executed in an order that might result in <em>stale reads</em> and generate a race condition.</p><p>In the example that we illustrated above, we intentionally represented the various tasks (<em>read</em>, <em>increase</em> and <em>save</em>) as discrete units. Note how the system is never executing more than one task at the same time. This is a simple but accurate representation of how the Node.js event loop processes tasks on a single thread. Nonetheless, you can see that there might be situations where multiple logical transactions (e.g. multiple deposits) are scheduled concurrently on the event loop and the discrete tasks might end up being intermingled, which results in a race condition.</p><p>So... <strong>Yes</strong>, we can have race conditions in Node.js!</p><h2 id="a-node.js-example-with-a-race-condition">A Node.js example with a race condition</h2><p>Now, let's talk some code! Let's try to re-create the Roman Empire simulation game example that we discussed above.</p><p>In ancient Rome, Romans used to export olives and grapes. No wonder Italy is still famous worldwide for olive oil and wine! In our game, we want to be able to harvest olives and grapes and then sell them as a means to acquire more <em>aurei</em>.</p><p>We are going to have two functions that can increase the balance by <code>50</code> <em>aurei</em> which we are going to call <code>sellOlives()</code> and <code>sellGrapes()</code>. We will also assume that every time the balance is changed, it is persisted to a data storage of sort (e.g. a database). For the sake of this example, we won't be using a real data storage, but we will just simulate some random asynchronous delay before reading or modifying a global value. This will be enough to illustrate how we can end up with a race condition.</p><p>For starts, let's see what a buggy implementation might look like:</p><pre><code><br><br><span>const</span> <span>randomDelay</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span><span>(</span><span>resolve</span> <span>=&gt;</span><br>  <span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span>resolve<span>,</span> Math<span>.</span><span>random</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>100</span><span>)</span><br><span>)</span><p><br><br><span>let</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>0</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>loadBalance</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <br>  <span>await</span> <span>randomDelay</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  <span>return</span> balance<br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>saveBalance</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <br>  <span>await</span> <span>randomDelay</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  balance <span>=</span> value<br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>sellGrapes</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellGrapes - balance loaded: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br>  <span>const</span> newBalance <span>=</span> balance <span>+</span> <span>50</span><br>  <span>await</span> <span>saveBalance</span><span>(</span>newBalance<span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellGrapes - balance updated: </span><span><span>${</span>newBalance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>sellOlives</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellOlives - balance loaded: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br>  <span>const</span> newBalance <span>=</span> balance <span>+</span> <span>50</span><br>  <span>await</span> <span>saveBalance</span><span>(</span>newBalance<span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellOlives - balance updated: </span><span><span>${</span>newBalance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>main</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> transaction1 <span>=</span> <span>sellGrapes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>  <span>const</span> transaction2 <span>=</span> <span>sellOlives</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>  <span>await</span> transaction1 <br>                     <br>  <span>await</span> transaction2<br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Final balance: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></p></code></pre><p>If we execute this code we might end up with different results. In one case we might get the correct outcome:</p><pre><code>sellOlives - balance loaded: 0<br>sellOlives - balance updated: 50<br>sellGrapes - balance loaded: 50<br>sellGrapes - balance updated: 100<br>Final balance: 100</code></pre><p>But in other cases we might end up in a bad state:</p><pre><code>sellGrapes - balance loaded: 0<br>sellOlives - balance loaded: 0<br>sellGrapes - balance updated: 50<br>sellOlives - balance updated: 50<br>Final balance: 50</code></pre><p>Note how in this last case, <code>sellOlives</code> is essentially a stale read and therefore it will end up overriding the balance disregarding any work already done by <code>sellGrapes</code>. Yes, we do have a race condition, unfortunately!</p><p>Now, this example is simple ad it is not too hard to pinpoint exactly where the race condition has originated by just looking at the code.</p><p>Take a minute or two to read the code again. Check out the output from the 2 cases as well. Pay attention to the notes and the log messages and try to imagine how the Node.js runtime might execute this code in the 2 different scenarios.</p><p>Ok, now that you have done that, let's discuss together what happens.</p><p>In our <code>main</code> function, when we execute <code>sellGrapes()</code> and <code>sellOlives()</code>, since we are not awaiting the two operations independently, we are essentially scheduling both operations onto the event loop.</p><p>We only await the two transactions after they have been already scheduled, which means that they will work concurrently. After the two transactions have been scheduled, we wait for <code>transaction1</code> to complete and only then we wait for <code>transaction2</code> to complete. Note that <code>transaction2</code> might complete even before <code>transaction1</code>. In other words, awaiting for <code>transaction1</code> doesn't block <code>transaction2</code> in any way.</p><p>This approach is similar to writing the following code:</p><pre><code><span>await</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>sellGrapes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>sellOlives</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Using <code>Promise.all()</code> is a more commonly used way to schedule different tasks to run concurrently.</p><p>Note that with <code>Promise.all()</code>, the resulting promise will reject as soon as any of the promises rejects. In our previous example, since we await the two promises independently, we will always catch errors in <code>transaction1</code> before <code>transaction2</code>.</p><p>But let's not digress too much into this. Now that we understand the problem, how do we fix the race condition?</p><p>Well, it turns out that in this simple case, we might make things right quite easily:</p><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>main</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>await</span> <span>sellGrapes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>  <span>await</span> <span>sellOlives</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>                     <br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Final balance: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre><p>This implementation will consistently produce the following output:</p><pre><code>sellGrapes - balance loaded: 0<br>sellGrapes - balance updated: 50<br>sellOlives - balance loaded: 50<br>sellOlives - balance updated: 100<br>Final balance: 100</code></pre><p>As we can observe, <code>sellGrapes</code> is always started and completed <em>before</em> we start <code>sellOlives</code>. This makes the two logical transactions isolated and makes sure their tasks won't end up being mixed together in random order.</p><p>Problem solved... <em>vade in pacem</em> dear race condition!</p><h2 id="using-a-mutex-in-node.js">Using a mutex in Node.js</h2><p>OK, the previous example was illustrative, but if we are building a real game, chances are things will end up being a lot more complicated. We will probably end up having many different actions that might cause a change of balance. Those actions might be the result of a particular sequence of events and it might become hard to track down the discrete logical …</p></main></article></div>

<p>After a decade of fierce rivalry with China's technology giant Huawei, Europe's telecoms equipment champions Nokia and Ericsson could soon face myriad new competitors to contend with.</p>



<p>As Europe cuts back on using Huawei equipment in its 5G networks, mobile operators are looking far and wide for companies to replace it. The Continent's "big four" telcos Deutsche Telekom, Telefónica, Vodafone and Orange on Wednesday <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1578702">published</a> a joint "<a href="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20/POLITICO-Memorandum-of-Understanding-OPEN-RAN-big-four-operators-January-2021.pdf">memorandum of understanding</a>" pledging to prioritize the development of "Open RAN" technology, a concept that would benefit smaller equipment and software makers.</p>



<p>Open RAN encompasses the idea of chopping up the 5G supply chain into smaller pieces and imposing standards on equipment and software firms so their products can work together — a "Lego approach," as one expert called it, to digital infrastructure. It would allow operators to procure specialized kit and services in smaller contracts with different players to piece together a 5G network, breaking the market power of “end-to-end” vendors like Ericsson and Nokia.</p>



<p>The operators' public campaign in favor of the standards comes after years of lobbying against 5G security laws that will significantly decrease Huawei's market presence in Europe in coming years. The operators, now barred by governments from using Huawei in several European markets, see Open RAN as a fix to what they consider a duopoly in the vendor market that allows Ericsson and Nokia to charge higher prices for 5G equipment.</p>



<p>Once in place, Open RAN could help equipment makers like South Korea’s Samsung and Japan’s NEC, cloud providers and tech giants like Amazon, Google and Microsoft as well as smaller, specialized software companies like Altiostar and Mavenir gain a stronger foothold in Europe’s growing 5G market.</p>



<p>The big four operators said they'd also "promote to European policymakers and industry that adopting a competitive Open RAN ecosystem will place Europe and European industry at the front in the race of technological leadership."</p>



<p>But for the two European leading vendors, Ericsson and Nokia, the political push to boost new competitors could put more strain on already-narrow profit margins and troubled financials.</p>



<h3>Geopolitics of standards</h3>



<p>Operators across the world in 2018 started working on new standards in an association called the <a href="https://www.o-ran.org/about" target="_blank">O-RAN Alliance</a>. It's a standard-setting body that includes participants from more than 200 companies across the tech sector, including Microsoft, Facebook, chipmakers, software firms and Europe's leading vendors Ericsson and Nokia.</p>



<p>The O-RAN Alliance includes Chinese operators but not its tech giant Huawei — which is telling. </p>



<p>The Chinese giant has always perceived Open RAN as a challenge to its dominance: "O-RAN is currently hijacked for geo-political reasons. It's been weaponized, specifically against Huawei," a company official said in a conversation in June, requesting not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.</p>



<p>The push for Open RAN standards quickly gained pace in the U.S., where lawmakers realized the country's technology industry had missed the boat on developing 5G equipment.</p>



<p>U.S. Congress in November <a href="https://www.rcrwireless.com/20201118/policy/house-unanimously-passes-750-million-open-ran-5g-bill" target="_blank">passed a bill</a> approving $750 million in public funding to develop Open RAN technologies.   </p>



<p>The U.S. tech industry has also been leaning on European capitals through a lobby group called the <a href="https://www.openranpolicy.org/about-us/members/" target="_blank">Open RAN Policy Coalition</a>, formed in May last year. It gathers smaller U.S. software firms like Altiostar and Mavenir with household names like Cisco and Juniper and tech giants Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Intel and others. Non-U.S. names include Samsung, NEC, Fujitsu, Rakuten, as well as Europe's three largest telecoms operators and Nokia.</p>



<p>"One thing we've heard from European governments ... is that a diverse ecosystem is very important and they want to see that European vendors have a share of the market," said Alex Botting, senior director at Venable, a lobby firm that represents the coalition in talks with European authorities. </p>



<p>In London, the initiative got backing from the government when it <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1532681">presented</a> its "diversification strategy" in November. It pledged £250 million in funding to boost innovation in Open RAN and try to introduce new, smaller 5G equipment makers. It also pledged to fund a new trial with Japanese telecoms vendor NEC.</p>



<h3>Europe's gain, Europe's loss</h3>



<p>For European lawmakers, the question is which specific European companies would gain from Open RAN — besides the operators that expect it to bring down procurement prices.</p>



<p>The concept comes with risks to its own leaders in the field, Ericsson and Nokia, who increasingly have free range in markets that have blocked or are shunning Chinese vendors. </p>



<p>"If you break that duopoly and you have lots of new suppliers, what does that do to the two European incumbents?" said Alex Sinclair, chief technology officer at global telecoms operators association GSMA.</p>



<p>Nokia has arguably been more receptive to the idea of Open RAN, but Ericsson has been lukewarm. </p>



<p>Its Chief Technology Officer Erik Ekudden said <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1431389">in an interview in July</a> that the technology was still&nbsp;“maturing.” He said the telecoms network market was already open for competitors to try and enter, but few had succeeded because it's a tough market. “We have a consolidated market, we have relatively few radio access network vendors … But it’s still an extremely competitive market,” Ekudden said.  </p>



<p>Lawmakers in Europe have still sought to diversify telecoms vendors as part of the EU's "<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_123" target="_blank">5G security toolbox</a>" process that aimed to decrease the dependency on Huawei. </p>



<p>Regulators, lawmakers and industry officials are exploring policy options to soften the blow of phasing out Huawei, in working groups within the EU's digital services department as well as in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/nis-cooperation-group" target="_blank">NIS Cooperation Group</a>, a roundtable of cybersecurity experts of EU countries and the Commission.</p>



<p>In Berlin, the government also expressed support for Open RAN in recent updates of telecoms security rules, and operators have launched <a href="https://uk.nec.com/en_GB/press/202012/global_20201216_01.html" target="_blank">pilot projects</a> with new vendors already. </p>



<h3>Technical challenges ahead</h3>



<p>Above all, the operators' document Wednesday is a signal to both the industry's supply chain and the regulators overseeing it that they take Open RAN seriously.</p>



<p>In the document, they pledged to work together on Open RAN standards, invest in developing the technology and push governments and regulators to contribute research funding and “policy support.”</p>



<p>The four telcos, together with U.S. and Chinese counterparts like AT&amp;T, Verizon, China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom and others, buy the most network equipment. A choice for a certain technology is certain to spur research by suppliers in coming years, and that could speed up the process to get large Open RAN networks up and running. </p>



<p>"Left to its natural course, this would probably take many years to become significant," said GSMA's Sinclair, adding that operators' public support "is all about accelerating this."</p>



<p>But running a network of smaller building blocks also increases technical headaches, he said: "If you're dealing with smaller suppliers, you have quite a lot of procurement problems," adding Open RAN networks would need a "system integrator" company to manage all the different parts — a role that operators in past decades have sourced out to vendors like Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia.</p>

            Sun Jan 24 2021
          
          </p><p>The year is 2021.
The world has been transformed into a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
COVID-19 has been cured,
but one of the vaccines went horribly awry:
some of the people who got the Oxford-Zeneca vaccine started
frothing at the mouth,
indiscriminately biting people,
and chanting <em>"Volker Halbach, Volker Halbach"</em>
before succumbing to their lack of qualia.</p>
<p>Two back-to-back pandemics were too much for the world to handle,
and the remnants of humanity have been reduced to
scavenging for GrabFood discounts.</p>
<p>But there is hope. A new screening test has been devised:
a perfect test that can detect for sure
whether someone has the virus in a matter of seconds...</p>
<hr>
<p>You are an overworked civil servant at the Ministry of Health.
Your boss comes in one day
brandishing a couple of important-looking documents.</p>
<p>"New directive from the Minister---we need
to test every traveler that comes in to the country.
Can you write me a proposal by today?"</p>
<p>What choice do you have? You get to work.</p>
<h2 id="0.-the-basic-one">0. The basic one</h2>
<p>The proposal goes something like this:
All visitors to the country will line up at a testing booth.
When it's their turn they'll spit in a cup
and then their secretion will be tested for the virus.
If they test negative, they're free to go;
if they test positive, they're whisked away
to a quarantine facility <s>never to be seen again</s>.
You bang it all out and send it to your boss.</p>
<p><img src="https://lieuzhenghong.com/img/group_testing/queue.png" alt="How to test travelers"></p>
<p>You get a call the next day.
Your boss is aghast.</p>
<p>"We haven't got nearly enough tests
to test everyone who comes!" he shouts.</p>
<p>"Can we order more tests?" you ask.</p>
<p>"No, the whole world is out of tests."</p>
<p>You take a deep breath to calm yourself.</p>
<p>"The Minister wants us to test everybody that comes in, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"But we don't have enough tests to test everybody?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>A few choice words come to mind, but you (wisely) stay silent.</p>
<p>If your boss had any shame he'd have the courtesy
to at least <em>look</em> sheepish,
but unfortunately all senior civil servants have had that
part of the brain surgically excised.
In any case, he wants you to come up with a new proposal.
"Can you find some way to test everyone, but with fewer tests?
As few as possible?"
You try to say something noncommittal but he's already hung up.</p>
<hr>
<p>Clumps of your hair lie morosely on the table.</p>
<p>Testing everyone without enough tests for everyone?
How is that possible?</p>
<p>You review the evidence.
Preliminary findings suggest that
out of every 1000 people,
roughly 3 people will have the virus.
Also, the test is perfectly accurate and infinitely-sensitive,
which means that it always gives the right answer,
and we can test as many people as we want with one test.
(Since the test is infinitely-sensitive, you can test the tiniest
drop of a person's spit, and it will give you the right answer).</p>
<p>Then you have a flash of insight:</p>

<p>Let's make one small change to the protocol.
Visitors will have to queue-up-and-spit---just as before---but
now TWO visitors will spit in one cup.
This combined cup will then be sent for testing.
Because the test is infinitely sensitive, it will test
positive if either (or both) of the visitors have the virus.
If the combined test comes back negative, then neither visitor
has the virus, and they are free to go.
If it comes back positive, then at least one of the pair has the virus.
We then test each of them individually.</p>
<p>This two-visitors-one-cup protocol will save almost half
of the tests because most of the tests will come out negative.
Why is this so?
The key here is that <strong>most travelers don't have the virus.</strong></p>
<p>Let's use an example to illustrate.</p>
<p>Suppose we have 1,000 travelers and 3 of them have the virus. <sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>
If you test them individually then you will use up 1,000 tests.
If you pair them up at random, however, one of the following
must be the case:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are three pairs with one positive person,
and 497 all-negative pairs.</li>
<li>There is one pair with two positive people,
one pair of one pair with one positive person,
and 498 all-negative pairs.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the first case,
we will use 500 tests for each of the pairs.
Three of those tests will come out positive and we will use
an additional two tests for each of them.
The total number of tests is
<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>500</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>∗</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>506</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">500 + 3*2 = 506</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>In the second,
we will again use 500 tests for each of the pairs,
and use two additional tests for each of the two positive pairs,
for a total of
<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>500</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>∗</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>504</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">500 + 2*2 = 504</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>In either case, we've cut the number of tests needed by almost half!
This method only works because most travelers are negative,
and so most pairs will test negative.
By contrast, if the infection rate was much higher
and 800 out of every 1000 people had the virus then
almost all of the pairs would test positive
and you would do better just testing everyone individually.</p>

<p>If two is good, surely three is better, four even better,
and ten double-plus-good better?
We'll divide travelers into groups---of, say, ten---
and get them all to spit into the cup.
Doing so could save us even more
tests if most visitors don't have the virus.
Assuming we only have three visitors with the virus
out of our 1000 visitors,
there can be at most three positive groups <em>no matter the group size.</em>
Doing groups of 10 would mean at most thirty individual tests,
for an upper bound of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>100</mn><mo>+</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>∗</mo><mn>10</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>130</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">100 + (3*10) = 130</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> tests.</p>
<p>But of course, there's an upper bound to how many people you can
put in a group.
If you get all 1,000 people to spit into the same bucket (yucks) and test <em>that</em>
you'll only have to do one combined test,
but that test is definitely going to come out positive
and you're going to have to test all 1,000 people individually.
Then you haven't saved any tests at all.</p>
<p>We can calculate the optimal size for each group.
The trade-off of having bigger groups
is that you do fewer group tests that combine multiple people,
but have to do more individual tests when a combined test comes back positive.
Let's introduce some notation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of total people = <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></li>
<li>Number of infected = <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>K</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></li>
<li>Number of groups = <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">G</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></li>
<li>Number of people in each partition = <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mi>G</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N/G = p</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>In the worst case you have to do <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi><mo>+</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>∗</mo><mi>min</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>K</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>G</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">G + (p * \min(K, G))</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> tests.</p>
<p>Why is this so?
In the first step you need to test the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">G</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> groups.
And in the worst case, all <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>K</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> of the groups will come out positive
(ergo each positive group has exactly one positive person),
and you'll have to test each of those <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>K</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> groups individually
which takes <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> tests each.</p>
<p>We can prove by differentiation
that the optimal number of people in each partition,

<p>Using our example of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1000</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N=1000</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>K</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K=3</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>,
this would mean that the optimal group size is <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msqrt><mn>333</mn></msqrt></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sqrt{333}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>
which is something like 18.5. <sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> If we use <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>20</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p = 20</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> instead
(just so the numbers are easier to work with)
you would need <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>50</mn><mo>+</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>∗</mo><mn>20</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>110</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">50 + (3*20) = 110</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> tests at most
in the worst case, where you do 50 combined tests,
then test the 3 positive groups of 20 individually.</p>
<p>That's quite a big reduction.
By grouping people together into larger groups and testing those groups
we can decrease the number of tests needed by almost 90%,
from 1,000 to around 100.</p>
<p>You sketch out a diagram of how this larger group test approach works
and email it to your boss.
He makes a couple of quick scribbles on it
and it's quickly distributed to Border Control:</p>
<p><img src="https://lieuzhenghong.com/img/group_testing/group_test_base_2.png" alt="Handout to ministry workers"></p>
<p>For a while, all is well.
You've done the impossible with your great leap of insight
and your boss gives you an A in your performance appraisal.
Your meteoric rise through the ranks of the Civil Service
is all but assured, you think to yourself -- but alas,
Fate is never so kind...</p>
<hr>
<p>A few months later, you enter the office and find it in a
state of upheaval.</p>
<p>It is pandemonium.
Your colleagues are screaming, jumping on desks,
and smashing file cabinets:
files and papers litter the floor,
and your Director is bawling his eyes out.</p>
<p>"What happened here?" you ask,
and in between racking sobs he points to a
stack of papers on his desk:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As part of the Digital Government Blueprint
and the continuing economic difficulties
caused by the post-pandemic pandemic,
we call upon the Whole-of-Government
to embark upon a Productivity Improvement and Digitisation Journey
to increase WoG efficiency and reduce government expenditure...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lesser men would have gotten hopelessly lost
in the thick thicket of Bureaucrat-ease,
but you realise the subtext immediately.
In order for your boss to keep his year-end bonus
all his charges must demonstrate a 25% efficiency increase
---which means <em>you</em> have to reduce the number of tests by 25%.</p>
<p>(At this point the reader might wonder if a fairly mundane requirement
of a efficiency increase could lead to such an exaggerated scene.
I congratulate such a reader for his good fortune not to have worked
in the Civil Service).</p>
<p>You steal a furtive glance at your boss.
He seems to have recovered very quickly
and is now eyeing you expectantly.
You try to tell him that you've <em>already</em> saved him 90% of tests
but he's having none of it.
He quickly shoos you out of his office,
leaving you once again to do the seemingly impossible...</p>
<hr>

<p>Your most recent proposal is to test groups of 20.
If any group's test comes back positive,
test every single person in that group.
But must we test everyone individually once a group tests positive?
Can't we group people together again into subgroups of, say, 5?
And if that subgroup tests positive, can't we group people together <em>again</em>?
And so on.
After all, if we were able to save tests by
splitting our original group of 1000 into sub-groups,
maybe we can save even more tests by
splitting our sub-groups into sub-subgroups etc.</p>
<p>Here's an example. We have a group of 20 that tested positive.
We might then choose subgroups of 5 from that 20,
and start testing the first subgroup of 5.
If <em>that</em> subgroup tests positive we then split them
<em>again</em> into sub-subgroups of 2 and 3, and if those sub-subgroups
test positive we test them individually.
As before, if any group/subgroup/subsubgroup... tests negative
then we simply move on to the next one.</p>
<p><img src="https://lieuzhenghong.com/img/group_testing/breadth_first_search_2.png" alt="Breadth-first search"></p>
<p>Does this actually save us tests?
Let's think about how many tests we would use in the worst case.
The worst case is when the positive tests are as
"spread out" …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/apple">Apple</a> issued further warning stating that the additional magnets in <a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/iphone12">iPhone 12</a>, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max, also, <a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/magsafe">MagSafe</a> accessories pose a risk to people with pacemakers and defibrillators.</p>
<p>Apple had previously accepted that the tendency for the magnets to interfere with some implanted medical equipment, however, the company, now, has going further to explain the risk attached, then offering advice. Apple advised that distancing is of importance, most especially while charging wirelessly.</p>
<p>Not too long ago in October 2020 — coinciding with the release of its new phones — Apple made mention that there’s a risk of electromagnetic interference with some medical devices. The company, now, has finally updated the earlier issued support document which warned of the risks to give further advice.</p>

<p>Apple has, particularly, now provided more information on how far to distant iPhone and MagSafe accessories from sensitive medical devices.</p>

<p>This updated advice came after a report which was published in the Heart Rhythm Journal had warned of the danger from latest generation iPhone 12 “which can potentially subdue lifesaving therapy in a patient especially while placing the phone in upper pockets” .</p>
<p>Please find full text of the support document below:</p>
<p><strong>“About the magnets inside iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max, and MagSafe accessories</strong></p>
<p><em>iPhone contains magnets as well as components and radios that emit electromagnetic fields. All MagSafe accessories (each sold separately) also contain magnets — and MagSafe Charger and MagSafe Duo Charger contain radios. These magnets and electromagnetic fields might interfere with medical devices.</em></p>
<p><em>Though all iPhone 12 models contain more magnets than prior iPhone models, they’re not expected to pose a greater risk of magnetic interference to medical devices than prior iPhone models.</em></p>
<p><em>Medical devices such as implanted pacemakers and defibrillators might contain sensors that respond to magnets and radios when in close contact. To avoid any potential interactions with these devices, keep your iPhone and MagSafe accessories a safe distance away from your device (more than 6 inches / 15 cm apart or more than 12 inches / 30 cm apart if wirelessly charging). But consult with your physician and your device manufacturer for specific guidelines.</em></p>
<p><em>Consult your physician and medical device manufacturer for information specific to your medical device and whether you need to maintain a safe distance of separation between your medical device and iPhone or any MagSafe accessories. Manufacturers often provide recommendations on the safe use of their devices around wireless or magnetic products to prevent possible interference. If you suspect iPhone or any MagSafe accessories are interfering with your medical device, stop using your iPhone or MagSafe accessories.</em></p>
<p><em>We provide more information on safety at <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ng/guide/iphone/iph301fc905/ios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Important safety information</a> for iPhone in the iPhone User Guide.</em>”</p>

<p>Be safe…</p>

      <p>Send a simple email</p> 
      <p>Ogham provides a single entry point (<code>MessagingService</code>) to send any message. To send an email, just prepare the email content using the <code>Email</code> class. The fluent API lets you chain API calls and also helps to guide developers.</p> 
      <p>In standalone mode (without framework integration), <code>MessagingService</code> has to be instantiated. In this sample, the predefined behavior is used. The properties are used to configure the SMTP protocol/implementation.</p>

      <p>Send using a template</p> 
      <p>In real world applications, messages content need to be constructed with variable parts. That’s why Ogham provides integration with several templating engines.</p> 
      <p>The only difference here is the use of <code>TemplateContent</code> instead of a string. This indicates to Ogham that the content is a template to evaluate.</p> 
      <p>The template is located in the classpath (use of <code>classpath:</code>). The template contains variables (<code>name</code> and <code>value</code>). To evaluate the template, a model is needed to provide values for <code>name</code> and <code>value</code>. In the example, the class <code>SimpleBean</code> is defined with the properties and used as model.</p> 
      <p>Templates can be used for SMS or whatever in the same way.</p> 
      <p>In the sample, Thymeleaf template engine is used but it could be any template engine.</p>

<p>
The field of graph representation learning has grown at an incredible (and sometimes unwieldy) pace over the past seven years, transforming from a small subset of researchers working on a relatively niche topic to one of the fastest growing sub-areas of deep learning.
</p>
<p>
This book is my attempt to provide a brief but comprehensive introduction to graph representation learning, including methods for embedding graph data, graph neural networks, and deep generative models of graphs.

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>2020 was an intense year. I hope you're healthy and keep being healthy. I am privileged (as lots of software engineers and academics are) to be able to work from home during the pandemic. Let's not forget people in less privileged situations,  and let’s try to give them as much practical, psychological and financial support as we can these days. And as much joy as possible to everyone around :)</p>
<p>I cancelled the autumn MirageOS retreat due to the pandemic. Instead I collected donations for our hosts in Marrakech - they were very happy to receive our financial support, since they had a difficult year, since their income is based on tourism. I hope that in autumn 2021 we'll have an on-site retreat again.</p>
<p>For 2021, we (at <a href="https://robur.coop/">robur</a>) got a grant from the EU (via <a href="https://pointer.ngi.eu/">NGI pointer</a>) for "Deploying MirageOS" (more details below), and another grant from <a href="https://ocaml-sf.org/">OCaml software foundation</a> for securing the opam supply chain (using <a href="https://github.com/hannesm/conex">conex</a>). Some long-awaited releases for MirageOS libraries, namely a <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-first-release-of-awa-ssh">ssh implementation</a> and a rewrite of our <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-release-of-ocaml-git-v3-0-duff-encore-decompress-etc/">git implementation</a> have already been published.</p>
<p>With my MirageOS view, 2020 was a pretty successful year, where we managed to add more features, fixed lots of bugs, and paved the road ahead. I want to thank <a href="https://ocamllabs.io/">OCamlLabs</a> for funding work on MirageOS maintenance.</p>
<h2 id="Recap-2020">Recap 2020</h2>

<p>Here is a very subjective random collection of accomplishments in 2020, where I was involved with some degree.</p>
<h3 id="NetHSM">NetHSM</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.nitrokey.com/products/nethsm">NetHSM</a> is a hardware security module in software. It is a product that uses MirageOS for security, and is based on the <a href="https://muen.sk/">muen</a> separation kernel. We at <a href="https://robur.coop/">robur</a> were heavily involved in this product. It already has been security audited by an external team. You can pre-order it from Nitrokey.</p>
<h3 id="TLS-1-3">TLS 1.3</h3>

<p>Dating back to 2016, at the <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2016/tron-workshop-programme/">TRON</a> (TLS 1.3 Ready or NOt), we developed a first draft of a 1.3 implementation of <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls">OCaml-TLS</a>. Finally in May 2020 we got our act together, including ECC (ECDH P256 from <a href="https://github.com/mit-plv/fiat-crypto/">fiat</a>, X25519 from <a href="https://project-everest.github.io/">hacl</a>) and testing with <a href="https://github.com/tlsfuzzer/tlsfuzzer">tlsfuzzer</a>, and release tls 0.12.0 with TLS 1.3 support. Later we added <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls/pull/414">ECC ciphersuites to TLS version 1.2</a>, implemented <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls/pull/414">ChaCha20/Poly1305</a>, and fixed an <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls/pull/424">interoperability issue with Go's implementation</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto">Mirage-crypto</a> provides the underlying cryptographic primitives, initially released in March 2020 as a fork of <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-nocrypto">nocrypto</a> -- huge thanks to <a href="https://github.com/pqwy">pqwy</a> for his great work. Mirage-crypto detects <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/53">CPU features at runtime</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Julow">Julow</a>) (<a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/96">bugfix for bswap</a>), using constant time modular exponentation (powm_sec) and hardens against Lenstra's CRT attack, supports <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/39">compilation on Windows</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/avsm">avsm</a>), <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/90">async entropy harvesting</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/seliopou">seliopou</a>), <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/65">32 bit support</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/72">chacha20/poly1305</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/abeaumont">abeaumont</a>), <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/84">cross-compilation</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/EduardoRFS">EduardoRFS</a>) and <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/78">various</a> <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/81">bug</a> <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/83">fixes</a>, even <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/95">memory leak</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/talex5">talex5</a> for reporting several of these issues), and <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/99">RSA</a> <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/100">interoperability</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/psafont">psafont</a> for investigation and <a href="https://github.com/mattjbray">mattjbray</a> for reporting). This library feels very mature now - being used by multiple stakeholders, and lots of issues have been fixed in 2020.</p>
<h3 id="Qubes-Firewall">Qubes Firewall</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mirage/qubes-mirage-firewall/">MirageOS based Qubes firewall</a> is the most widely used MirageOS unikernel. And it got major updates: in May <a href="https://github.com/linse">Steffi</a> <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/qubes-users/c/Xzplmkjwa5Y">announced</a> her and <a href="https://github.com/yomimono">Mindy's</a> work on improving it for Qubes 4.0 - including <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/vm-interface/#firewall-rules-in-4x">dynamic firewall rules via QubesDB</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://prototypefund.de/project/portable-firewall-fuer-qubesos/">prototypefund</a> for sponsoring.</p>
<p>In October 2020, we released <a href="https://mirage.io/blog/announcing-mirage-39-release">Mirage 3.9</a> with PVH virtualization mode (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/mato">mato</a>). There's still a <a href="https://github.com/mirage/qubes-mirage-firewall/issues/120">memory leak</a> to be investigated and fixed.</p>
<h3 id="IPv6">IPv6</h3>

<p>In December, with <a href="https://mirage.io/blog/announcing-mirage-310-release">Mirage 3.10</a> we got the IPv6 code up and running. Now MirageOS unikernels have a dual stack available, besides IPv4-only and IPv6-only network stacks. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/nojb">nojb</a> for the initial code and <a href="https://github.com/MagnusS">MagnusS</a>.</p>
<p>Turns out this blog, but also robur services, are now available via IPv6 :)</p>
<h3 id="Albatross">Albatross</h3>

<p>Also in December, I pushed an initial release of <a href="https://github.com/roburio/albatross">albatross</a>, a unikernel orchestration system with remote access. <em>Deploy your unikernel via a TLS handshake -- the unikernel image is embedded in the TLS client certificates.</em></p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/reynir">reynir</a> for statistics support on Linux and improvements of the systemd service scripts. Also thanks to <a href="https://github.com/cfcs">cfcs</a> for the initial Linux port.</p>
<h3 id="CA-certs">CA certs</h3>

<p>For several years I postponed the problem of how to actually use the operating system trust anchors for OCaml-TLS connections. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/emillon">emillon</a> for initial code, there are now <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ca-certs">ca-certs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ca-certs-nss">ca-certs-nss</a> opam packages (see <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-ca-certs-and-ca-certs-nss">release announcement</a>) which fills this gap.</p>
<h2 id="Unikernels">Unikernels</h2>

<p>I developed several useful unikernels in 2020, and also pushed <a href="https://mirage.io/wiki/gallery">a unikernel gallery</a> to the Mirage website:</p>
<h3 id="Traceroute-in-MirageOS">Traceroute in MirageOS</h3>

<p>I already wrote about <a href="https://hannes.robur.coop/Posts/Traceroute">traceroute</a> which traces the routing to a given remote host.</p>
<h3 id="Unipi-static-website-hosting">Unipi - static website hosting</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/roburio/unipi">Unipi</a> is a static site webserver which retrieves the content from a remote git repository. Let's encrypt certificate provisioning and dynamic updates via a webhook to be executed for every push.</p>
<h4 id="TLSTunnel-TLS-demultiplexing">TLSTunnel - TLS demultiplexing</h4>

<p>The physical machine this blog and other robur infrastructure runs on has been relocated from Sweden to Germany mid-December. Thanks to UPS! Fewer IPv4 addresses are available in the new data center, which motivated me to develop <a href="https://github.com/roburio/tlstunnel">tlstunnel</a>.</p>
<p>The new behaviour is as follows (see the <code>monitoring</code> branch):</p>
<ul><li>listener on TCP port 80 which replies with a permanent redirect to <code>https</code></li><li>listener on TCP port 443 which forwards to a backend host if the requested server name is configured</li><li>its configuration is stored on a block device, and can be dynamically changed (with a custom protocol authenticated with a HMAC)</li><li>it is setup to hold a wildcard TLS certificate and in DNS a wildcard entry is pointing to it</li><li>setting up a new service is very straightforward: only the new name needs to be registered with tlstunnel together with the TCP backend, and everything will just work</li></ul>

<h2 id="2021">2021</h2>

<p>The year started with a release of <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-first-release-of-awa-ssh">awa</a>, a SSH implementation in OCaml (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/haesbaert">haesbaert</a> for initial code). This was followed by a <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-release-of-ocaml-git-v3-0-duff-encore-decompress-etc/">git 3.0 release</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/dinosaure">dinosaure</a>).</p>
<h3 id="Deploying-MirageOS-NGI-Pointer">Deploying MirageOS - NGI Pointer</h3>

<p>For 2021 we at robur received funding from the EU (via <a href="https://pointer.ngi.eu/">NGI pointer</a>) for "Deploying MirageOS", which boils down into three parts:</p>
<ul><li>reproducible binary releases of MirageOS unikernels,</li><li>monitoring (and other devops features: profiling) and integration into existing infrastructure,</li><li>and further documentation and advertisement.</li></ul>

<p>Of course this will all be available open source. Please get in touch via eMail (team aT robur dot coop) if you're eager to integrate MirageOS unikernels into your infrastructure.</p>
<p>We discovered at an initial meeting with an infrastructure provider that a DNS resolver is of interest - even more now that dnsmasq suffered from <a href="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DNSpooq_Technical-Whitepaper.pdf">dnspooq</a>. We are already working on an <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-dns/pull/251">implementation of DNSSec</a>.</p>
<p>MirageOS unikernels are binary reproducible, and <a href="https://github.com/rjbou/orb/pull/1">infrastructure tools are available</a>. We are working hard on a web interface (and REST API - think of it as "Docker Hub for MirageOS unikernels"), and more tooling to verify reproducibility.</p>
<h3 id="Conex-securing-the-supply-chain">Conex - securing the supply chain</h3>

<p>Another funding from the <a href="http://ocaml-sf.org/">OCSF</a> is to continue development and deploy <a href="https://github.com/hannesm/conex">conex</a> - to bring trust into opam-repository. This is a great combination with the reproducible build efforts, and will bring much more trust into retrieving OCaml packages and using MirageOS unikernels.</p>
<h3 id="MirageOS-4-0">MirageOS 4.0</h3>

<p>Mirage so far still uses ocamlbuild and ocamlfind for compiling the virtual machine binary. But the switch to dune is <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage/issues/1195">close</a>, a lot of effort has been done. This will make the developer experience of MirageOS much more smooth, with a per-unikernel monorepo workflow where you can push your changes to the individual libraries.</p>


<p>If you want to support our work on MirageOS unikernels, please <a href="https://robur.coop/Donate">donate to robur</a>. I'm interested in feedback, either via <a href="https://twitter.com/h4nnes">twitter</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@hannesm">hannesm@mastodon.social</a> or an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/hannesm/hannes.nqsb.io/issues">data repository</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-21858">
	
	<!-- .entry-header -->

	<div>
		<p>There is a book by Wall Street Journal reporter Zuckerman, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Solved-Market-Revolution/dp/073521798X">The Man Who Solved the Market: How Jim Simons Launched the Quant Revolution</a>, about James Harris Simons–a former mathematician, physicist, and code breaker–who launched arguably the most successful hedge fund ever, Renaissance Technologies, which for decades has posted annual returns in excess of 40%,  making it by far the most successful hedge fund ever. Equally impressive is that in the nearly 40 years of its existence, Renaissance has never had a down year. Unfortunately but understandably, Harris’ methodology of how he ‘solved’ Wall Street remains opaque in spite of intense interest and sleuthing online, but one can infer that it involves various ‘statistical methods,’ which is still hopelessly vague but the best we can infer with the information Zuckerman and others have supplied.</p>
<p>But move over Harris, because there is a cadre of traders who also appear to have ‘solved the market,’ but unlike Harris, they make their trades openly public for ‘bragging rights’ and ‘meme value.’ But Renaissance Technologies is in a league of its own in terms of uninterrupted, smooth returns, but in terms of absolute returns, especially at an endeavor in which so few beat the market, these new traders possibly have him beat. </p>
<p>But let’s go back  a bit in history. For years, probably as far back as the late ’90s, message boards and blogs dominated online financial discourse. Then came Twitter, along with YouTube, creating new avenues for traders share wins, losses, and strategies . Sites such as StockTwits, which leveraged the Twitter platform and popularized ‘dollar hashtags’ (such as $AAPL for Apple), grew in popularity. By 2013-2015 or so, at its peak, the ‘finance sphere’ was composed of YouTube channels (such as Tasty Trade, which makes me cringe just typing it out), blogs (such as Seeking Alpha, which aggregates many blogs, and also individually-run blogs), popular message boards (such as Elite Trader and Yahoo Finance message boards), StockTwits (which still exists but is full of ads and is a shadow of its former popularity, having been subsumed by Twitter), trading podcasts, and also Reddit.  </p>
<p>Looking back, I only realize now that that all those platforms had one thing in common: no was actually making money . Except for proprietors of newsletters, as well as YouTube channels and blogs that collected ad revenue, the actual traders themselves tended to either lose money or make only table scraps. In spite of this torrent of content, the one thing everyone was ultimately seeking–profits–was out of reach or only a pittance.</p>
<p>Then in 2015, the Reddit sub /r/WallStreetBets changed all of that. Suddenly people were making money for a change, posting verifiable screenshots and video screenshot captures of substantial returns. In any given day, one can easily find many posts  of option traders turning thousands or even hundreds of dollars into <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8tbz0/recovered_4_months_40k_from_pltr_yolo/">tens</a> of thousand, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63ykM9PBNK8&amp;feature=youtu.be">hundreds</a> of thousand, or even <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8n3io/1m_from_460_video_so_the_haters_among_you_dont/">millions</a> of dollars of profit. Other are making substantial, market-beating returns with ‘buy and hold,’ without options, which tend to be riskier than stocks but produce far greater returns. Of course, given the inherently risky nature of options and leverage, some traders on WallStreetBets also lose substantial sums of money (getting rekt, blowing up, or washed-out, as it’s called), posting screenshots of the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8i3ko/105000_gone_in_30_days_fucked_myself_bigtime_on/">losses</a> in all their glory. One ‘degenerate’ [as part of the in-group culture and lingo, traders on WallStreetBets often refer to each other as degenerates or autists, which is not at all that inaccurate of a description], for example, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k30ty7/410k_of_losses_over_8_months/">lost</a> $400k on ill-timed Tesla options. In regard to the above links of massive wins, it is not like I am cherry-picking: all of these were selected within a single day, going no deeper than 2 pages within the sub. On any given day, one can easily find at least three or more screenshots and other documented evidence of substantial profits, all within the first page. </p>
<p>Memes and jokes aside, we’re talking big money. Millions of dollars is nothing to scoff at, especially given the statistically improbable and high frequency of such profitable trades, all fully disclosed to the public, and the inherent difficulty of trading and ‘beating the market,’ which is a goal retail speculators and institutional investors alike  aspire to but many fall short of, so seeing these ‘autists and degenerates’ post the sort of consistent returns that make Google salaries seem small by comparison, is bound to draw some attention. Consequently, after relative obscurity in 2015, WallStreetBets has exploded in popularity over the past few years as the Trump bull market and the even bigger bull market in tech stocks has enriched speculators greatly, and whipped people up into a get-rich-quick frenzy, and especially since Covid, as young people find themselves with ample free time and money (in spite of joblessness and ‘tough times’, there always seems to be money to trade).</p>
<p>So back to James Simmons, I believe, contrary to EMH purists, that actual trading ‘skill’ exists, and that returns comparable Renaissance Technologies, or even greater, are possible, and that there are traders on /r/WallStreetBets who are doing that now (sure, they do not have billions of dollars, but you have to start somewhere, and small, successful strategies can be scaled up). The common retort is that if losses and wins follow a normal distribution, then we would expect given a large enough pool of traders that some traders on the tail-end of the distribution will appear very successful and have a long string of big wins, by pure chance. Yet empirical observation seems to suggest otherwise.  Despite the large losses, it is evident some traders have a knack for making consistent, large profits, and that some strategies are superior to others, with far greater frequency that can be attributed by chance alone. Even if unsuccessful traders are disinclined to post their results on /r/WallStreetBets, there are enough large winning trades and successful traders, that we can infer such a strategy. Even hedge funds are taking notice , trying to elicit such tradable and replicable strategies and gems from the pile of memes and ‘shitposts’. </p>
<p>So why is WallStreetBets, large losses not withstanding, so successful , when all prior communities failed to deliver on actual profits? My belief, again deferring to HBD, is that the addition of 20 or more extra IQ points from the generally high-IQ Reddit community created superior strategies. The blogs and communities that predated WallStreetBets focused mostly on technical analysis (annotating stock charts with lines and diagrams to predict price direction) and small cap stocks (penny stocks are often very popular on stock massage boards and blogs, yet few people make money trading them), but those strategies are inferior to the strategies the successful traders on WallStreetBets employ. Eschewing technical analysis or small cap stocks, traders on WallStreetBets focus instead on dominant, big tech companies and employ a more holistic, fundamental approach and ignore chart patterns. Traders on WallStreetBets correctly deduced that the ‘easy money’ is made with $50-500+ billion companies such AMZN and TSLA, not small or medium-sized stocks, which tend to be more volatile and give up their gains too easily, whereas mega-cap tech stocks such as Tesla and Amazon hold their gains, have less volatility, and have superior absolute returns compared to smaller stocks despite being orders of magnitude bigger (Tesla stock, for example, despite being worth $600 billion , was up 700% for 2020). </p>
<p>A possible objection is that, sure, we can go back in time and find successes such as Tesla and Amazon, but how do we know this is not just luck, versus skill? Maybe they just got lucky in choosing those stocks and that the luck will run out. But consider the recent success of Palantir (PLTR). As soon as Palantir went public on September  30th, WallStreetBets traders immediately honed in on it and began buying. For example, one trader <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j3fdws/i_went_yolo_on_palantir_ipo_yesterday/">bought</a> shares as soon as it began trading, on the IPO, at what was then $9/share. Palantir, just 2 months later,  trades at  $27/share–a gain of 200%, far surpassing the S&amp;P 500, which was only up 15% year-to-date. Scanning the archives of WallStreetBets, one finds dozens of instances of traders speculating, correctly, that Palantir would go higher and profiting greatly by buying call options on Palantir or buying shares outright, typically on Robinhood. Many traders have made six figures in profit doing so.   So out of a pool of thousands of companies to choose from, WallStreetBets correctly singled out Palantir, one of the strongest-performing stocks of the past 2 months even before it it gained 200%. This is demonstrative of actual skill and not just guessing. </p>
<p>Hedge funds spend inordinate amounts of money hiring some of the smartest PHDs and other credentialed experts to find strategies that may give their funds even just a small edge over the S&amp;P 500 or some other benchmark, yet the retail traders on WallStreetBets appear to leave these experts in the dust. Sure, in fairness, hedge funds seek to minimize volatility whereas WallStreetBets  traders appear inured by the volatility that comes with trading highly speculative call options, yet it would at the same time seem as if they have found a strategy that otherwise was overlooked by the experts. The experts have been trying to time the bottom on value stocks and commodity stocks, for years, to no avail, but WallStreetBets traders chose growth, market dominance, and size over cheapness.  By possessing above-average IQs and a strong and reliable intuition about how the market works, WallStreetBets traders were able to ferret-out–much like how James Harris, who is a genius, was able to find winning strategies–that buying call options and or ‘buying and holding’ these handful of large, dominant tech …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>In the confusing jungle of transpiler languages for JavaScript, there are some gems. <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TypeScript</a> is mainstream, <a href="https://rescript-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ReScript</a> is starting to establish itself, and <a href="https://elm-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elm</a> is still an insider tip. This article takes a detailed look at ReScript – but also sheds light on the limitations of the young language. In what projects does its use make sense? What projects should rather use TypeScript on the one hand or Elm on the other?</i></p><p>In web environments, nothing works without JavaScript. Not surprisingly, JavaScript is a popular <a href="http://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">target language for transpilers</a> – compilers that do not convert to bytecode but into the source code of another language. Teams like to use transpiler languages such as TypeScript, ReScript, or Elm for their advantages like static typing, modern language features, or support for functional programming. Static typing and functional programming are of particular interest here.</p><h2>Static typing</h2><p>The topic of static typing is highly controversial and often leads to religious wars. A strong type system helps detect and avoid errors. But whether type checks should happen at runtime or at compile time is a matter of opinion. More objectively, there are arguments for both sides. Clear advantages of static type systems are</p><ul><li>early error detection (type safety)</li><li>auto-completion</li><li>documentation</li><li>optimizations</li></ul><h3>Type safety</h3><p>The costs for the removal of a defect depend on the moment of its discovery. If an error is discovered that has just occurred, it is usually quickly found and corrected. An error that a customer discovers months later in production often takes considerably more time to fix. Almost every experienced developer has an anecdote about how he or she spent three days looking for a bug.</p><p>Static typing helps detect certain error classes at an early stage and thus avoid efforts like debugging. Test-driven development (TDD) has the same effect. However, type safety and TDD address different error classes. A combination of both is desirable. The claim that static typing alone leads to less error-prone code is controversial – scientific studies have not been able to <a href="https://danluu.com/empirical-pl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prove it</a>.</p><h2>Auto-completion &amp; Documentation</h2><p>In many web projects it is not uncommon to constantly use new APIs from libraries or even other project teams. In this respect, a good autocomplete in the IDE can save a lot of time. Even without auto-completion, type specifications serve as documentation and help to understand functions faster.</p><h4>Optimization</h4><p>A compiler/transpiler that knows the type of a value can sometimes perform optimizations in the generated code that would otherwise not be possible.</p><h4>Costs of static typing</h4><p>On the other hand, it is necessary to consider the costs of static typing. These include:</p><ul><li>Code noise</li><li>additional effort due to type conversion</li><li>higher compiler runtimes</li><li>increased complexity</li></ul><h3>Code noise</h3><p>Code noise means that the readability of code can deteriorate significantly when many type annotations obscure the view. JavaScript blogger Eric Elliot calls this <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-typescript-tax-132ff4cb175b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TypeScript tax</a> and questions the return of investment of static type systems.</p><h3>Effort, complexity &amp; compilation time</h3><p><strong>Additional effort</strong> may be required if it is necessary to convert values into other types, e.g. to pass them to an external function. <strong>Long compilation times</strong> can cause developers to lose focus while waiting for the result of a change – a frustrating experience for experimental tasks. Finally, a static type system comes with its own set of concepts that need to be mastered – resulting in an <strong>increase in complexity</strong>.</p><h2>Exploiting the type system</h2><p>Since static type systems have advantages and disadvantages, there are two strategies:</p><p><strong>Option 1:</strong> The team forgoes a type system and thus the benefits, but also the costs – the language of choice is classic JavaScript or <a href="https://picostitch.com/blog/2020/05/12-typescript-for-javascript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TypeScript without type annotations</a>. This option is often ridiculed, but it can be a legitimate choice. To ensure the quality of the software, high test coverage is even more important here.</p><p><strong>Option 2:</strong> The team tries to exploit the type system as much as possible. That is, it is important to maximize the advantages and minimize the disadvantages. Some features of the type system can help: Type inference and structural typing can minimize code noise and refactoring efforts. Discriminated unions help write code that is as error-free as possible and detect problems at compile time – more on this later.</p><h2>Functional programming</h2><p>An increasing number of JavaScript developers are discovering functional programming for themselves – libraries such as underscore, <a href="https://lodash.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lodash</a> or <a href="https://ramdajs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RamdaJS</a> have long been favorites of many teams. The functional-inspired <em>React</em> is considered the most popular UI-framework and even the classic object-oriented <em>Angular</em> relies on a variant of functional programming in the form of <a href="https://rxjs.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RxJS</a>. The strengths of functional programming include:</p><ul><li><strong>Immutable</strong> data structures</li><li>A <strong>stateless</strong> programming model</li><li>Simple <strong>composition</strong> of functions</li><li>Reduction of complexity</li></ul><p>One of the big problems of imperative programming is the so-called <em>Mutable State</em> – i.e. a state that can be changed. The fact that the state changes means that the code at runtime can differ significantly from the code that the IDE shows statically. As a result, a debugger is often required to understand what the code is doing in the first place. Functional programming minimizes the problem by avoiding mutable state. To ensure that this is possible in performant way, the language must be optimized for this, or the team uses an appropriate library, such as <a href="https://github.com/immerjs/immer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Immer</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://github.com/rtfeldman/seamless-immutable" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seamless-immutable</a>.</p><p>However, libraries can extend JavaScript only to a limited extent. Some concepts require direct language support.</p><h2>Transpiler languages</h2><p>Transpiler languages like TypeScript, ReScript, and Elm help by providing a static type system and support for functional concepts.</p><h2>TypeScript</h2><p>TypeScript hardly needs an introduction, as it is the most popular of the transpiler languages. The <a href="https://2019.stateofjs.com/javascript-flavors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">State of JS 2019</a> study also reported the highest developer satisfaction:</p><div id="attachment_79461"><p><a href="https://2019.stateofjs.com/javascript-flavors"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-79461" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/12/stateofjs-1024x282.png" alt="State of JS 2017 - Language Flavors: Developer Satisfaction" width="1024" height="282" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/12/stateofjs-1024x282.png 1024w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/12/stateofjs-1280x352.png 1280w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/12/stateofjs-768x211.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/12/stateofjs-400x110.png 400w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/12/stateofjs.png 1337w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-79461">State of JS 2019 – Language Flavors: Developer Satisfaction</p></div><p>A closer look reveals that TypeScript does not resemble rigid type systems of well-known OOP languages; rather it has features that are more reminiscent of functional languages. These include, among others:</p><ul><li>Structural typing and <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-compatibility.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">structural subtyping</a></li><li>An algebraic type system including <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/unions-and-intersections.html#discriminating-unions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discriminated union types</a></li></ul><h3>Structural typing</h3><p>TypeScript relies on so-called <em>structural typing</em>, i. e. not the name of a type is relevant (<em>nominal typing</em>), but the structure. Here is an example:</p><div><pre>type Person = { firstName: string; lastName: string };
type User = { firstName: string; lastName: string };
type Dog = { firstName: string };

let person1: Person = { firstName: "Alice", lastName: "Foo" };
let user1: User = { firstName: "Bob", lastName: "Bar" };
let dog1: Dog = { firstName: "Wuffy" };

let greet1 = (person: Person) =&gt;`Hello ${person.firstName}`;

greet1(person1); //OK
greet1(user1);   //OK
greet1(dog1);    // =&gt; Error (as expected)</pre></div><p>This brings some advantages: converting a value to match the type is not necessary. As long as the structure is the same, TypeScript accepts the value. This is also a prerequisite for so-called <em>structural subtyping</em> – a concept similar to <em>duck typing</em> that is only available in dynamic languages:</p><div><div><pre>let greet2 = (person: { firstName: string }) =&gt;`Hello ${person.firstName}`;

greet2(person1); //OK
greet2(dog1);    //OK, the obj has prop "firstName"
greet2(27);      // =&gt; Error (as expected)</pre></div><p>Function <em>greet2</em> accepts any object as long as the subtype <em>“an object with firstName of type string”</em> is fulfilled. Whether or not the object has other properties, such as <em>lastName</em>, is irrelevant for the call of <em>greet2</em>.</p></div><h3>Discriminated union types</h3><p>To maximize the error detection of a type system, it is important to design types correctly: valid values must be representable in the type system, invalid ones must be rejected. Domain-driven design calls this <em>enforcing invariants</em> (see <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/179133.Domain_Driven_Design?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=Kq7YXEJnKH&amp;rank=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software</a>). Of course, it is easy to code checks that enforce invariants at runtime. However, a good type system checks for invariants at compile time. Here&nbsp;an example with so-called <em>discriminated union types</em>:</p><div><pre>type Color = "green" | "red" | "blue";

type Circle = {
  kind: "Circle";
  radius: number;
};

type Rectangle = {
  kind: "Rectangle";
  height: number;
  width: number;
};

type Shape = Circle | Rectangle;

let circle1: Shape = { kind: "Circle", radius: 10 };       //OK
let <em>rectangle1</em>: Shape = { kind: "Rectangle", radius: 10 }; //Error correctly detected
let <em>rectangle2</em> = { kind: "Rectangle", radius: 10 };        //OK, but should be an Error</pre></div><p>In the case of <em>color</em>, the union type still looks like a simple <em>enum</em>. However, <em>shape</em> should make clear that different variants of shapes can also bring different data. A shape here is either a circle or a rectangle. Circles have a <em>radius</em>, rectangles <em>height</em> and <em>width</em>. A rectangle must not have a <em>radius</em>.</p><p>If a value (here: the variable <em>rectangle1</em>) is marked as a shape, TypeScript can detect the error – in our case: rectangle with radius. Sidenote: <em>kind</em> is not a keyword of the language, any identifier is possible.</p><p>If the type annotation is missing, as is the case with <em>rectangle2</em>, the type system of TypeScript unfortunately fails to detect the error. TypeScript is considered <a href="http://logan.tw/posts/2014/11/12/soundness-and-completeness-of-the-type-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unsound</a>. ReScript goes a step further here and can detect the error with <em>rectangle2</em> using type inference – more about this later.</p><h3>AnyScript</h3><p>The TypeScript type system is particularly helpful for teams that have the discipline to type consistently. However, TypeScript also provides the ability to gradually type less. This is a useful feature for teams that plan to migrate existing JavaScript code to TypeScript piece by piece. The downside, however, is that it can cause the team to neglect typing. The temptation is always near to assign an <em>any</em> instead of a difficult type annotation or even to switch off the typing by means of an <em>@ts-ignore</em> comment.</p><p>What saves time at first usually takes its toll later on, namely when the compiler …</p></div></div>

				<p>Latches and barriers are coordination types that enable some threads to wait until a counter becomes zero. You can use a <code>std::latch</code> only once, but you can use a <code>std::barrier</code> more than once. Today, I have a closer look at latches.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/LatchesAndBarriers/TimelineCpp20.png" alt="TimelineCpp20" width="650" height="224"></p>
<p>Concurrent invocations of the member functions of a <code>std::latch</code> or a <code>std::barrier</code> are no data race. A data race is such a crucial term in concurrency that I want to write more words to it.</p>
<h2 id="h1-data-race">Data Race</h2>
<p>A data race is a situation, in which at least two threads access a shared variable at the same time and at least one thread tries to modify the variable. If your program has a data race, it has undefined behavior. This means all outcomes are possible and therefore, reasoning about the program makes no sense anymore.</p>
<p>Let me show you a program with a data race.</p>

  <span>int</span> balance{<span>100</span>};                                                 <span>// (3)</span>               
};

<span>void</span> <span>addMoney</span>(Account<span>&amp;</span> to, <span>int</span> amount){                             <span>// (2)</span>

  <span>for</span> (<span>auto</span><span>&amp;</span> thr<span>:</span> vecThreads) thr.join();

<p>100 threads adding 50 euros to the same account (1) using the function <code>addMoney</code> (2). The initial account is 100 (3). The crucial observation is that the writing to the account is done without synchronization. Therefore&nbsp;we have a data race and, consequently, undefined behavior. The final balance is between 5000 and 5100 euro (4).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/LatchesAndBarriers/addMoney.png" alt="addMoney"></p>
<p>What is happening? Why are a few additions missing? The update process <code>to.balance <span>+=</span> amount; </code>in line (1) is a so-called read-modify-write operation. As such, first, the old value of <code>to.balance</code> is read, then it is updated, and finally is written. What may happen under the hood is the following. I use numbers to make my argumentation more obvious</p>
<ul>
<li>Thread A reads the value 500 euro and then Thread B kicks in.</li>
<li>Thread B read also the value 500 euro, adds 50 euro to it, and updates <code>to.balance</code> to 550 euro.</li>
<li>Now Thread A finished its execution by adding 50 euro to <code>to.balance</code> and also writes 550 euro.</li>
<li>Essential the value 550 euro is written twice and instead of two additions of 50 euro, we only observe one.</li>
<li>This means, that one modification is lost and we get the wrong final sum.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, there are two questions to answer before I present <code>std::latch</code> and <code>std::barrier</code> in detail.</p>
<h2 id="h2-two-questions">Two Questions<code><br></code></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is the difference between these two mechanisms to coordinate threads?</strong> You can use a <code>std::latch</code> only once, but you can use a <code>std::barrier</code> more than once. A <code>std::latch</code> is useful for managing one task by multiple threads; a<code> std::barrier</code> is helpful for managing repeated tasks by multiple threads. Additionally, a <code>std::barrier</code> enables you to execute a function in the so-called completion step. The completion step is the state when the counter becomes zero.</li>
<li><strong>What use cases do latches and barriers support that cannot be done in C++11 with futures, threads, or condition variables combined with locks?</strong> Latches and barriers address no new use cases, but they are a lot easier to use. They are also more performant because they often use a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm">lock-free </a>mechanism internally.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me continue my post with the simpler data type of both.</p>
<h2 id="h3-std-latch"><code>std::latch</code></h2>
<p>Now, let us have a closer look at the interface of a <code>std::latch</code>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/LatchesAndBarriers/memberFunctionsLatch.png" alt="memberFunctionsLatch" width="600" height="161"></p>
<p>The default value for <code>upd</code> is <code>1</code>. When <code>upd</code> is greater than the counter or negative, the behavior is undefined. The call <code>lat.try_wait()</code> does never wait as its name suggests.</p>
<p>The following program <code>bossWorkers.cpp</code> uses two <code>std::latch</code> to build a boss-workers workflow. I synchronized the output to <code>std::cout</code> using the function <code>synchronizedOut</code> (1). This synchronization makes it easier to follow the workflow.</p>

    andreiWork.join();
    andrewWork.join();
    davidWork.join();
  
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>The idea of the workflow is straightforward. The six workers <code>herb</code>, <code>scott</code>, <code>bjarne</code>, <code>andrei</code>, <code>andrew</code>, and <code>david</code> in the <code>main</code>-program have to fulfill their job. When they finished their job, they count down the <code>std::latch workDone</code> (2). The boss (<code>main</code>-thread) is blocked in line (3) until the counter becomes 0. When the counter is 0, the boss uses the second <code>std::latch goHome</code> to signal its workers to go home. In this case, the initial counter is <code>1</code> (4). The call g<code>oHome.wait</code> (5) blocks until the counter becomes 0.</p>

<p>When you think about this workflow, you may notice that it can be performed without a boss. Here is the modern variant:</p>

<pre><span>// workers.cpp</span>

<span>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>
<span>#include &lt;latch&gt;</span>
<span>#include &lt;mutex&gt;</span>

std<span>::</span>latch workDone(<span>6</span>);
std<span>::</span>mutex coutMutex;

    std<span>::</span>lock_guard<span>&lt;</span>std<span>::</span>mutex<span>&gt;</span> lo(coutMutex);
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> s;
}

<span>class</span> <span>Worker</span> {
 <span>public:</span>
    Worker(std<span>::</span>string n)<span>:</span> name(n) { };
  
    <span>void</span> <span>operator</span>() () {
        synchronizedOut(name <span>+</span> <span>": "</span> <span>+</span> <span>"Work done!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>);
        workDone.arrive_and_wait();  <span>// wait until all work is done  (1)</span>
        synchronizedOut(name <span>+</span> <span>": "</span> <span>+</span> <span>"See you tomorrow!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>);
    }
 <span>private:</span>
    std<span>::</span>string name;
};

<span>int</span> <span>main</span>() {

    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>'\n'</span>;

    Worker herb(<span>"  Herb"</span>);
    std<span>::</span><span>thread</span> herbWork(herb);
  
    Worker scott(<span>"    Scott"</span>);
    std<span>::</span><span>thread</span> scottWork(scott);
  
    Worker bjarne(<span>"      Bjarne"</span>);
    std<span>::</span><span>thread</span> bjarneWork(bjarne);
  
    Worker andrei(<span>"        Andrei"</span>);
    std<span>::</span><span>thread</span> andreiWork(andrei);
  
    Worker andrew(<span>"          Andrew"</span>);
    std<span>::</span><span>thread</span> andrewWork(andrew);
  
    Worker david(<span>"            David"</span>);
    std<span>::</span><span>thread</span> davidWork(david);

    herbWork.join();
    scottWork.join();
    bjarneWork.join();
    andreiWork.join();
    andrewWork.join();
    davidWork.join();
  
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>There is not much to add to this simplified workflow. The call <code>workDone.arrive_and_wait(1)</code> (1) is equivalent to the calls <code>count_down(upd); wait();</code>. This means the workers coordinate themself and the boss is no longer necessary such as in the previous program <code>bossWorkers.cpp</code>.</p>

<h2 id="h4-what-s-next">What's next?</h2>
<p>A <code>std::barrier i</code>s quite similar to a <code>std::latch</code>. <code>std::barrier</code>'s strength is it to perform a job more than once. In my next post, I will have a closer look at barriers.</p>

<p>I’ve tried lots of things for remote desktop, then settled for Chrome Remote Desktop. Official docs are not so reliable, and this gist did
the trick.</p>

<p>Honestly I don’t use this at all, but I think it is nice to have.</p>




<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/organizm/ae09f72bd5badc64d4727a0d38fc590b">https://gist.github.com/organizm/ae09f72bd5badc64d4727a0d38fc590b</a></p>



<ul>
  <li>Jellyfin is free &amp; open source, and it is not bloated with ads.
Start Jellyfin with Nvidia hardware acceleration enabled(You can check out <a href="https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/hardware-acceleration.html">docs</a> for more). Docker-compose is buggy with GPUs, so I have to use command
line for this. You have to install <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker">nvidia-docker2</a> before hand.</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code>docker run <span>-d</span> <span>\</span>
 <span>--name</span><span>=</span>jellyfin <span>\</span>
 <span>-e</span> <span>NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES</span><span>=</span>all <span>\</span>
 <span>-e</span> <span>NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES</span><span>=</span>all <span>\</span>
 <span>--gpus</span> all <span>\</span>
 <span>--pid</span> host <span>\</span>
 <span>--runtime</span><span>=</span>nvidia <span>\</span>
 <span>-p</span> 8096:8096 <span>\</span>

 <span>-v</span> /data/jellyfin/cache:/cache <span>\</span>
 <span>--restart</span> unless-stopped <span>\</span>
 jellyfin/jellyfin:unstable
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since it is sharing(<code>--pid host</code>) PID namespace with host, you can run <code>nvidia-smi</code> on host machine directly to see if
Jellyfin is using GPU when transcoding content.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.lsgrep.com/images/jellyfin-nvidia.png" alt="jellyfin-nvidia"></p>

<ul>
  <li>Register an <a href="http://opensubtitles.org/">OpenSubtitles.org</a> account and install the plugin for the Jellyfin. You have
 to login with your account in the plugin settings page. With this you can add subtitles to your videos without too much effort.</li>
</ul>



<p><code>rclone</code> is kinda aggressive, so you have to use <code>--max-delete 0</code> to keep your files intact in your destination.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>rclone <span>sync</span> <span>--max-delete</span> 0 <span>-v</span> REMOTE_DRIVE:legal_movies movies <span>--stats</span> 10s
</code></pre></div></div>

January 25, 2021 | https://panelbear.com/blog/why-not-open-source/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://panelbear.com/blog/why-not-open-source/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Let me start by saying that there's many open source projects that have successfully demonstrated that open-source can support a business, and I have great respect for them. I’m thinking of projects like <a href="https://sidekiq.org/" rel="noopener">Sidekiq</a>, <a href="https://sentry.io/" rel="noopener">Sentry</a>, and <a href="https://matomo.org/" rel="noopener">Matomo</a>, but there's plenty more.</p><p>As a developer, I also prefer having access to the source code for the systems I rely on. That way, I can inspect it, and even patch it for my specific needs whenever the license allows.</p><p>I’ve learned a lot by reading code written by more experienced people than me, mostly from open source projects like <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="noopener">Django</a>, <a href="https://github.com/twitter/finatra" rel="noopener">Finatra</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" rel="noopener">Kubernetes</a>, or <a href="https://reactjs.org/" rel="noopener">React</a> to name a few. Needless to say, I owe a lot to the open source community, and for that I will forever be grateful.</p><p>That said, I'm writing this from the angle of building a sustainable SaaS service <em>as a solo founder</em>. Your own context will influence whether my story is relatable to you.</p><h2>Been there, learned a lot</h2><p>I want to offer reliable software that I continue to maintain over the years, whether it’s open source or closed source, free or paid. However, I also need to be able to pay my bills. Ideally I'd build free, open-source software and still be able to afford a place to live (housing in Munich has gone insane). Unfortunately life's not that simple, and it doesn’t appear to work for most projects unless backed by established companies or those that happen to be at the right place at the right time. Donations could help, but odds are I won’t be able to support my livelihood with this model and continue to build and support the project.</p><p>So about three years ago I thought I had found the holy grail: I would develop the SaaS as an open source project that anyone could self-host, while offering a hosted version which I can manage for my customers. I assumed 90% of the users would just self-host it themselves, but it’d be a good enough compromise. So I went ahead, and did exactly <a href="https://traduora.com/" rel="noopener">that</a>.</p><p>Needless to say, I was very naive to think that running a business is the same as running an open source project. Just because lots of people and organizations use your software each month, doesn’t mean you can automatically support your livelihood.</p><p>But business model aside, the main issue comes along in the form of expectations regarding your commitment as an open source maintainer. For some reason, many people have come to expect open-source maintainers to deliver the same quality in the same amount of time that an entire team at a company could, and they want it for free. I learned that nothing makes people disappear faster from a GitHub thread than asking them if they want to contribute the code changes themselves.</p><p>This particular project I’m talking about has been downloaded more than half a million times (Docker pulls + GitHub clones) over the past two years. While this helped me raise awareness about the project, it did not lead to a successful business model on its own as I had (naively) assumed.</p><h2>What went wrong</h2><p>Back then, I choose to open source the project alongside a SaaS offering based on the following assumptions:</p><ul><li>It would lead to a healthier codebase, as more eyes were looking into it.</li><li>It would improve trust, as anyone can audit my code.</li><li>It would reduce the support burden, as people can look at past issues, and participate in the discussion threads.</li><li>It would help me drive growth, as marketing is not my strength.</li><li>The community would help me build new features for their specific use cases.</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, almost all points above were false assumptions in my case. And sometimes it actually led to the opposite result. I won't dive into each point, but the main issue that this created for me was: increased operational burden as a solo-founder. If I was working together with a small team, the story may be different.</p><p>That said, there are many people who did contribute to the project, and for that I’m very grateful. It’s just unfortunate that they’re by far the minority.</p><p>Also I made the mistake of trying to be everything for everyone. I was too focused on developing every feature, trying to give support to every single ticket, and I completely ignored the marketing aspects of it as I had no time for it. It also made it really difficult to understand which issues to prioritize, and which ones might lead to more people supporting the business.</p><p>Not only that, but things like backwards compatibility for those self-hosting, handling support requests via email and chat groups, providing assistance to those installing it on incompatible platforms, were just taking away too much of my time. I was a solo founder, wearing all hats, prioritizing everything that came my way. Looking back, I ask myself: how could that work?</p><p>So while the project was used by several organizations, I quickly realized that it wasn't going to pay the bills given the time I was putting into it. Very soon I lost what helped me push along the whole way: my motivation. I knew while the project was of relative success on the open source front, it would require massive effort on my side to turn things around operationally and business-wise. However, without motivation, it’s easier said than done. The spark had simply faded away.</p><p>I did learn a lot out of this experience, and that's also why I have a lot of appreciation for those who have managed to get it right. I once read that making software is only 30% of what makes a tech company, and while I cannot confirm that number is accurate, the idea behind it rings true to me.</p><p>In short, like everyone else, I only have a limited amount of time in this world, and I have a life with family and friends to live too. Over the years I’ve had to re-evaluate how much time I'm willing to allocate to supporting each project.</p><p>So it needs to be sustainable if I want to do this for the long-term. I do continue to support every project I open source, but have reduced the release frequency to about twice per year. The main exception is security issues, which I do try to handle as soon as humanly possible.</p><p>I really don't want to be that guy that cannot be relied on, but I have other things going on in my life, just like everyone else, and have to watch out for my health too. Running a business, contributing to open-source, getting everything to run on the latest M1 chips is fun stuff, but so is living a full life with your loved ones.</p><h2>Pick your battles</h2><p>Last year I launched a new service, <a href="https://panelbear.com/" rel="noopener">Panelbear</a>, which is what the rest of this post is about. In short, it's a simple performance monitoring + website analytics SaaS that I started last September. It's fully self-funded, but this time I’m not open sourcing it from the start.</p><p>In the past, when it came to running a business <em>as a solo-founder</em>, having it open source created too much maintenance burden for very specific feature requests. In particular from non-paying users, who sometimes sent me emails directly, demanding I look at their issue, or help them fix things “as soon as possible”.</p><p>I am now trying another approach, and so far it’s more sustainable in my case. I have a better idea of which features to prioritize based on paying customers, which surprisingly tend to be more respectful of my time when they needed support.</p><p>Not being open source from the start, means I’ve been able to pivot and reinvent features more easily, as there’s not many “breaking changes” to coordinate (except for public APIs and libraries), or self-hosted deployments to support. I’m able to move faster because there’s only one deployment environment to support (or two if you count staging).</p><p>It’s also much more sustainable to build and grow a product at a pace in which it’s “just a thing I do” along with other things going on in my life, while being able to cover your expenses. There’s a saying: “slow is smooth, smooth is fast”, which feels very fitting in this case.</p><h2>I continue to open-source, when it makes sense</h2><p>Don't get me wrong, I do rely on, and continue to contribute to many open-source projects. I would have never gotten this far without the amazing community that continues to build, and support all these projects on their own time.</p><p>It's not entirely out of the question if I might one day reconsider, and open-source new projects. But for now I'll mainly open up libraries, and utilities, with a much smaller scope. That way I can afford to provide support for them, and hopefully more people are able to contribute since the codebase is smaller.</p><p>One day I might write a blog post reflecting on my second SaaS. That's the joy of the journey, there’s always something to learn.</p></div></div></div>]]>

                    <p>An alarm clock for the rest of us</p><p>It’s a brand new year, which means I should really start writing a new post.
I’ve been wanting to for a while, but we’ve been in lockdown for two months now and Google Analytics is the only indication that I’m not alone on the planet, and most of that is bots anyway.
I’ve decided to take a page out of the book of my friend, <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/">James Stanley</a>, who both does cool things <em>and</em> actually writes about them, so I’m starting to document all my projects again.</p>
<p>Given my non-frenetic, slow-paced lifestyle, I’ve long had a non-burning need.
I don’t use an alarm to wake up, as I start work late, but I still want to know what time it is when I wake up, just to see if it’s way too early and I can go to sleep again.
A few days a week I have tennis and need to get up early, but if it’s windy or rainy or very cold, the practice gets canceled and I want to know before I’m awake enough to not be able to go to sleep again.</p>
<p>To accommodate this lifestyle, I’ve traditionally turned to my mobile phone, but that has some disadvantages.
Namely, the screen is too bright and wakes me up when I check the time, and I’m too obsessive to not check all my messages instead of falling asleep when I see the notifications on the screen.
I’ve long thought that a bedside alarm clock would be perfect for me, but I couldn’t find one that fulfilled all my requirements:</p>
<!-- break -->

<ul>
<li>I needed something that had a screen that would always be always lit, so I could check the time with one eye and half a brain awake, in the complete darkness of the bedroom.</li>
<li>A screen that wasn’t too bright and wouldn’t disturb sleep, but that would also be legible in direct sunlight, so I could see the time during the day.
This meant adaptive brightness.</li>
<li>Octagonal shape so I can lay it down on its side (or at 45°) instead of having to crane my neck up to check the time when lying down (I really did think of everything).</li>
<li>Weather forecast for the next hour or two, so I can reliably fail to wake up for tennis when not necessary.</li>
<li>Annoying beeper for alarms.</li>
<li>Less annoying built-in LEDs that would increase in brighness for a few minutes before an alarm went off, so I can wake up less annoyed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the result:</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot2.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot2-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>Look at this sexy thing.</span></p></div><p>Sexy.</p>
<h2>Designing this thing</h2>
<p>Conceptually, making an alarm clock to fulfill these requirements isn’t hard.
You take a small OLED screen, an ESP8266, connect them together, add some LEDs and a buzzer, and you’re done!
Since the hardware was more-or-less straightforward, I started with designing the octagonal case:</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/clock-back.png" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/clock-back-small.png"></a></p><p><span>The back of the clock.</span></p></div><p>The OLED screen has four mounting holes, so I designed the mount around them.
For the ESP8266, I use a WeMos D1 Mini board, as it’s quite small and nice to work with.
I initially thought I’d have to connect the WeMos to the four pins of the screen with wires, but I discovered that if you kinda squint, you can get four of the ESP8266’s pins to match up with the screen’s pins and in the correct order, which means I could solder the ESP8266 behind the screen module directly, which simplified the wiring by a lot.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/mockup.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/mockup-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>Look at that subtle off-white coloring.</span></p></div><p>While designing the clock, I created a quick mockup of the screen as I wanted it to show.
I decided I wanted the hour to be displayed in as big letters as possible, since this screen is small, and the other elements I wanted were wind speed, temperature and weather forecast for the next hour.</p>
<p>The other components left to add were a photoresistor (for sensing ambient light), a buzzer and a LED strip.
They were all straightforward to add, the resistor is connected to the ESP8266’s analog pin, and the buzzer and LED strip to some other free pins.</p>
<h2>The software</h2>
<p>The software was the slightly trickier part in this build, although that was pretty straightforward too.
I needed multiple components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting the time somehow (there’s no real-time clock on the ESP8266 and I didn’t want to add one).</li>
<li>Dimming the screen in a pleasing manner.</li>
<li>Getting the weather forecast and current weather.</li>
<li>Connecting to WiFi and autoupdating.</li>
<li>Annoying me into wakefulness in a satisfactory manner.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The clock</h3>
<p>There’s an old Chinese saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>To know the time, you must first connect to the internet.</p>
<p>– Sun Inc</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily, connecting to the Internet is very easy with tzapu’s <a href="https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager">excellent WiFiManager</a> library.
The clock creates an access point, you join it with your phone or computer, give it your WiFi network’s password, and you’re done.</p>
<p>After connecting, an NTP library can fetch the time every so often from the closest server, so the clock is always up to date.
It was important to me that this clock is solid enough to trust with my most important wake-up alarms, and it achieves this goal admirably (unless the internet connection is down).</p>
<p>That also takes care of autoupdates, since I have a simple, secure autoupdate machine I set up using <a href="https://gitlab.com/stavros/espota-server">ESPOTA-server, an autoupdate server I wrote for the ESP8266</a>.
The clock checks for a new update every day, and automatically downloads and installs it.
This way, distributing updates will work reliably, even to millions of devices, for when you realize that collecting all the users’ personal data is slightly monetizable.</p>
<h3>The dimming</h3>
<p>After a bit (or a lot) of searching, I finally found how to dim the OLED screen, and another important feature was well on the way of being implemented.
Because it was rather hard to find, I’ll post the code here, along with the appropriate SEO keyword for people to be able to find it.
Here is the code for dimming an SSD1306-compatible, I2C 128x64 OLED screen:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>void</span> <span>brightnessTask</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>brightness</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Set the brightness of the SSD1306 OLED screen with this hack.</span>
    <span>// From https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFpXfSnDNSY.</span>
    <span>// `brightness` should be a value between 5 (for some reason) and 255.</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>SSD1306_SETCONTRAST</span><span>);</span> <span>//0x81</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>brightness</span><span>);</span>

    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>SSD1306_SETPRECHARGE</span><span>);</span> <span>//0xD9</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>

    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>SSD1306_SETVCOMDETECT</span><span>);</span> <span>//0xDB</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Once I discovered that, the rest of the dimming was easy:
I would just read the ambient light from the photoresistor and set the screen’s brightness according to the photoresistor’s value.</p>
<p>Another job <del>well</del> done.</p>
<h3>The weather</h3>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot1.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot1-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>What a beauty.</span></p></div><p>Getting the weather was easier than I thought.
<a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeather</a> has a simple API, which accepts a pair of coordinates and gives you the current weather and forecast for that location.
It only took a few minutes to fetch that data on the clock, and then I spent some time positioning them on the screen and turning the forecast into an appropriate icon so it could be displayed on the small screen.</p>
<p>To display the icons, I used <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/overview">Adafruit’s always helpful GFX library</a> and converted the OpenWeather icons to a format more suitable for display on a monochrome screen.
This took a bit of trial and error, as I wanted the icons to be easily distinguishable at a glance, even though their size was 12x12 pixels and just one color.
In the end, I think they worked out well, as it’s easy to tell if it’s raining or not.</p>
<h3>The wakefulness</h3>
<p>So the initial plan here was to have a buzzer buzz loudly and annoyingly in an attempt to wake me up.
However, I am a pretty light sleeper, and I hate loud and annoying sounds (surprisingly), so I wanted this to be a last resort.
The solution I came up with here is the following:</p>
<p>Say I want to set the alarm for 9:30, just in time to be ten minutes late for tennis.
The LEDs would start glowing very faintly at 9:20, slowly increasing in intensity over the next ten minutes, at which point they’d reach maximum.
If I still wasn’t up by then, the buzzer would begin beeping at the top of its lung, hopefully waking me up reliably.
This seemed like a pretty good algorithm, and one that would both wake me up pleasantly and reliably.</p>
<p>There was only one problem:
The clock doesn’t have any buttons or controls or any way for me to enter the alarm time.
I could create a web server where I could configure alarms, but I figured I’d rather get a rooster instead, so I did neither and just made an alarm clock that cannot alarm.
This symbolizes the futility of human existence and its incessant search for meaning in a cold and unfeeling universe that’s ultimately profoundly devoid of such, and then you die.</p>
<p>Not having to wake up to a buzzer is cool, though.</p>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>Overall, I’m pretty happy with this clock!
I can now open an eyelid, look at the time and fall asleep again, which is a massive quality-of-life improvement over the previous “fuck sleep I’ve got Instagram likes” situation.
The octagonal shape is a killer feature, I keep the clock angled 45° (as in the photo) and it really is the perfect angle for reading it while lying down.</p>
<p>One thing I’d like to improve in the future is to add a battery, because right now it’s solely USB powered and will obviously die if there’s a power outage. Adding a small LiPo battery and a charger circuit will be pretty easy and will ensure that the clock can keep running for hours even without power.</p>
<p>The source code is here:</p>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/stavros/do-not-be-alarmed">https://gitlab.com/stavros/do-not-be-alarmed</a></p>
<p>It’s not very complete, so use it at your own risk, and I haven’t really added deployment details, but it should be very easy to build with one PlatformIO command.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>A printed photo in an album can easily last 20+ years without deterioration.</p>
<p>Digital files are another story altogether: computers fail, hard drives crash,
and CDROMs deteriorate.</p>
<p>Reliably and robustly storing digital files used to require an IT staff and rack
of expensive hardware. Recent innovations have made this affordable and easy to
do, even for non-nerds.</p>
<p><em>TL;DR: Make sure you have <strong>multiple copies</strong>, on <strong>separate hardware</strong>, and
preferably <strong>at least one</strong> copy offsite. Newer filesystems available on NAS
devices can provide additional data integrity safeguards. And remember, <a href="https://photostructure.com/faq/raid-is-not-a-backup/">RAID
doesn’t count</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-old-axiom-3-2-1-backups">The old axiom: “3-2-1 backups”<a href="#the-old-axiom-3-2-1-backups" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>The “3-2-1” backup strategy from several decades ago was one of the more common
strategies for keeping files safe.</p>
<p>This strategy requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>at last <strong>three</strong> different copies of every file, with</li>
<li>at least <strong>two</strong> different <em>storage formats</em>, and</li>
<li>at least <strong>one</strong> copy offsite.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nowadays, though, you can do better.</p>
<h2 id="why-different-storage-formats">Why different storage formats?<a href="#why-different-storage-formats" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>If you store your data on different formats, the hope is that the different
formats will have different lifespans. When one copy fails before the other, it
gives you time to make a new copy.</p>
<p>There are several problems with this line of reasoning, though.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://photostructure.com/img/2020/06/dvd.jpg" alt="Optical media"> <figcaption>
<p>Optical media</p>

</figure>
<p>The first issue is that storage formats available to consumers are typically
only hard drives and optical storage media (CD-R, DVD-R, or BD-R). The latest
optical storage technology (as of July, 2020), is quad-layer blue ray which can
store 100GB per disk. External hard drives are regularly in the 6-12TB range,
which are <strong>60-120x larger</strong>. Backing up a $150 12TB hard drive on optical media
would be ridiculously herculean and expensive: it would take 120 BD-R disks, and
$1,400 in media, using $12 M-Discs.</p>
<h2 id="why-3-2-1-isnt-enough-data-integrity">Why 3-2-1 isn’t enough: data integrity<a href="#why-3-2-1-isnt-enough-data-integrity" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>All commonly available storage formats eventually suffer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_degradation">data
degradation</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_corruption">corruption</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CD-R’s with organic dyes may only last a couple years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive">Solid-state drives</a>, or SSD,
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/solid-state-disks-lose-data-if-left-without-power-for-just-a-few-days/">lose data integrity when unplugged in as little as a
year</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SD cards, when left unplugged, experience “cell voltage drift,” and lose integrity in 5-7 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive">Hard disk drives</a>, commonly
called HDD or “spinning rust”, have <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/hard-drive-test-data.html">substantial failure rates after 4-6 years
of continuous
service</a>. Even when
kept offline, HDD data integrity will degrade after 5-10 years due to
demagnetization of the iron oxide substrate, or servo and platter motor
failures. (Feel fortunate if your decade-old external drive still spins up!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Data integrity is the big issue that “3-2-1 backups” doesn’t address: <strong>even if
you’ve got several copies of your data, how do you know that each copy hasn’t
suffered from data degradation?</strong></p>
<h2 id="an-example-of-data-degradation">An example of data degradation<a href="#an-example-of-data-degradation" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>Your photos and videos are comprised of hundreds of thousands, millions or even
tens of millions of bits of data.</p>
<p>If a handful of those bits are “flipped” due to storage defects or media
degradation your file can become unreadable.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of an image with only a couple bits flipped:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://photostructure.com/img/2020/06/bitrot.jpg" alt="JPEG bit rot after flipping 0, 1, 2, or 3 bits (source)"> <figcaption>
<p>JPEG bit rot after flipping 0, 1, 2, or 3 bits (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_degradation">source</a>)</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Note that the rightmost image contents are 99.999% correct, yet isn’t viewable.</p>
<h2 id="error-correction-codes">Error correction codes<a href="#error-correction-codes" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>Hard drives and optical disks use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">error correction
codes</a> to provide some
amount of resiliency to bit rot. Typical ECC allows for several bits in a file
to flip, be detected, and be automatically repaired.</p>
<p>ECC can only detect and repair a specific rate of bit rot, however. Data
degradation in older storage media may exceed this rate.</p>
<h2 id="treating-the-symptom">Treating the symptom<a href="#treating-the-symptom" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>In developing PhotoStructure, we found that many of our photos on older hard
drives had succumbed to some amount of bit rot. We taught PhotoStructure how to
detect and skip over photos and videos that are corrupt, in the hope that you’ll
have several copies of a given photo, and one of them won’t have bit rot.</p>
<p>But this feature just treats the symptom: this doesn’t fix the underlying
problem.</p>
<h2 id="overcoming-bit-rot">Overcoming bit rot<a href="#overcoming-bit-rot" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>Several advanced filesystems, including
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs">btrfs</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS</a>, support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_scrubbing">data
scrubbing</a>, which detects and
repairs bit rot automatically.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, neither Windows nor macOS support these filesystems (and their
newer filesystems, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_File_System">APFS</a>,
still don’t detect bit rot). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_(macOS)">Time
Machine</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup_and_Restore">Backup and
Restore</a> don’t detect bit rot
either.</p>
<p>So: <em>how do normal people use these fancy new filesystems?</em></p>
<h2 id="nas-to-the-rescue">NAS to the rescue<a href="#nas-to-the-rescue" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage">Network-attached
storage</a> (NAS) devices
hold several large hard drives and quietly do their work safely storing your
files. You can keep using your favorite OS, but you don’t have to worry about
bit rot anymore.</p>
<p>Most NAS also support Docker, which is a way of packaging and running
third-party applications, like PhotoStructure.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/products/series/home">Synology</a> is the easiest
and most “plug and play” of these solutions. Be sure to get a <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/Storage/Which_Synology_NAS_models_support_the_Btrfs_file_system">newer NAS that
supports
btrfs</a>.</p>
<p>Synology’s proprietary hardware comes at a bit of a cost premium than if you
built it yourself, and docker support via their UI is a bit limited (which can
be overcome by using a tool like <a href="https://www.portainer.io/">Portainer</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://unraid.net/">Unraid OS</a> runs on hardware you already
have, supports XFS and btrfs, has great docker support, but requires a
commercial license to use. It’s very flexible in adding and removing drives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.truenas.com/truenas-core/">TrueNAS CORE</a> (previously “FreeNAS”) is
free and fairly easy to install. It uses ZFS, and supports a wide variety of
hardware. If building a computer is intimidating and you’d like to try
TrueNAS CORE, the <a href="https://www.truenas.com/truenas-mini/">TrueNAS Mini</a> comes
pre-assembled.</p>
<p>Note that expanding existing volumes by adding additional disks (which is
simple on Synology and Unraid) is <em>not fun</em> on FreeNAS, due to limitations in
ZFS. FreeNAS natively uses FreeBSD jails, which are technically excellent but
decidedly less popular than Docker. More recent versions of FreeNAS have added
docker support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.snapraid.it/">SnapRAID</a> is different from these other
alternatives, in that it’s not an operating system nor a filesystem: it’s an
open-source application that runs on Linux, macOS and Windows.</p>
<p>SnapRAID is the only non-realtime data integrity product here: it must be run
periodically to build snapshots or check and repair data integrity errors.
SnapRAID requires command-line expertise and manual setup.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(PhotoStructure has no commercial affiliation with any of these products. We’d
caution against cheaper NAS brands, however, as lax security updates may lead to
malware infections and data loss.)</em></p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-your-nas">Getting started with your NAS<a href="#getting-started-with-your-nas" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Consider getting a NAS that supports 4 or more drives. More slots for more
drives gives you a lot more flexibility in the future, should your data
exceed your original drives. If you’re building a box to run Unraid,
<a href="https://www.fractal-design.com/">Fractal</a> makes some nice cases: the new
<a href="https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/define/define-7/black/">Define
7</a> and
<a href="https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/meshify/meshify-2/black/">Meshify

support 12+ HDDs (!!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buy 50% more storage than you need right now so you have room to grow in the
near future.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Enable

</li>
<li>
<p>Set up your NAS to either apply security patches automatically or notify you
to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider installing a virus scanner and malware detection package on your
NAS. Synology has a “security audit” tool as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure your router has recently-updated firmware</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use secure admin and user passwords. Enable 2FA if available. Using a
password manager like <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a> makes this easy to
do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure your NAS to tell you if it has any errors: <strong>you don’t want any
disks dying or backups failing without you knowing it.</strong></p>

<p>Please understand: <a href="https://photostructure.com/faq/raid-is-not-a-backup"><strong>RAID is not a backup</strong></a>. Please
read that post before continuing.</p>
<p>Satisfy the 2nd or 3rd copy of the “at least 3 copies” rule by copying the
entire contents of your NAS to an external hard drive that normally stays
powered down and offline. Do this quarterly.</p>
<p>Consider storing this drive near your emergency kit so you can grab it as you
leave your house in case of an emergency.</p>
<p>This external drive can also reduce your dataloss if your NAS catastrophically
fails, or if you get hit by malware like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoLocker">cryptolockers</a>.</p>

<p>Satisfy the “at least 1 offsite” rule by setting up your NAS to back up to a
cloud service automatically. <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/">Backblaze</a> and
<a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/">tarsnap</a> are both well-regarded offsite storage
solutions, and both have solutions that work with your new NAS.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to pay for cloud storage, you can set up another NAS (like at
a friend or family member’s house). Both FreeNAS and Synology support NAS-to-NAS
replication.</p>
<p>Make sure you configure the replication job to run in the middle of the night,
and throttle network bandwidth so you don’t make your friends or family grumpy.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Generating APIs is becoming more and more popular. Especially the GraphQL community is "suffering" from this trend.
Production-ready APIs with authentication and caching in minutes, define the schema, and you're almost done.
As we all know, everything comes at a cost.
This post takes a critical look at generated GraphQL APIs, the benefits as well as the tradeoffs you're going to make.</p><h2>History and Trends<a href="#history-and-trends" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Generated GraphQL APIs look like a hot trend nowadays. Some venture backed companies push this topic hard to make it mainstream.
We hear praises of the amazing developer experience and how productive people are.
However, is this really a sustainable business?</p><p>If we look back a few years you might remember the term "Backend as a Service" (BaaS), established by companies like Parse.
The impact of parse, nowadays seems to be diminished. A lot of others jumped on the BaaS train, but except Firebase, you don't hear much on the topic nowadays.</p><p>Then came GraphQL and companies tried the same thing again.
If we look at the graveyard of failed companies you might find some familiar names like Reindex, Graphcool, etc...</p><p>Today, we have tools like Appsync and Hasura leading the pack, followed by many smaller companies who imitate them and try to diversify in various ways.</p><p>Appsync might be an outlier because their goal is not only BaaS but making AWS products easy to integrate, which is a different value proposition than their competition.</p><p>Another emerging trend is (Serverless) Databases as a Service.
dgraph offers a native GraphQL Database.
FaunaDB offers a Serverless Database which also comes with a GraphQL interface.
Then there's edgeDB which also offers a GraphQL interface.
I guess if you search for a while you'll find more.</p><p>Another quite popular category is Content Management Systems with GraphQL APIs.
The distinction from just BaaS is that these tools allow non-technical people to create content while developers can consume the content via GraphQL APIs.</p><p>How comes that the idea of BaaS/generated APIs keeps coming up while most of the implementations fail?</p><p>We might be able to look back in time to better understand why this approach is failing.
If you ask Prisma, the makers of Graphcool, they refer to this tweet:</p><blockquote><p>Exposing the database schema 1:1 via a generated graphql api totally misses the point of graphql - or an api as an intended abstraction.</p><p>-- <cite>Manuel Schoebel</cite></p></blockquote><p>We'll come back to this citation later.</p><h2>Developer experience of generated APIs<a href="#developer-experience-of-generated-apis" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>One feature of generated APIs you cannot deny is the developer experience.
If you're an experienced Full-Stack developer you're able to start new projects in minutes.
Spin up a database, define the schema, API done. You're now able to start building the frontend.</p><p>Some of the services allow you to build the schema using a user interface only.
This allows even less experienced Frontend developers to build their own "APIs".
You click a few buttons and your API with authentication is ready to use.</p><p>But what about maintenance?
How do you evolve applications built using this approach?
What if you don't just have one API consumer?</p><p>Let's have a look at possible use cases.</p><h2>Use cases of generated APIs<a href="#use-cases-of-generated-apis" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Generating APIs can be an amazing time-saver if you're a single developer, working on a small project.
You don't have to expose the API to other developers. It's just you using them.
You understand the tradeoffs, e.g. leaking some business logic into the client.
You're still happy because you saved a lot of time not having to build a backend.</p><p>Another good example where generated APIs can be very helpful is prototyping.
You want to bring an idea to life. You don't care about the quality of your API.
All you need is some CRUD methods to demonstrate an application to a prospect.</p><p>What about larger teams and projects? Are generated APIs also a good fit for enterprise use cases?</p><p>In order to answer this question, let's first have a look at what an API is.</p><h2>What is an API?<a href="#what-is-an-api" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>I'll not go into much detail of this topic, as I want to stay focused.
If you're interested to learn more about what an API is, I can highly recommend Erik Wilde <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDYeU2T4v2o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">talking about the topic</a>.</p><p>Too long, didn't watch:</p><p>An API is an interface, abstracting away an implementation of a contract.
In Eriks example, he explains how a weather forecast company exposes their forecasts through an API to other developers.</p><p>GraphQL is a Query language, offering one way of implementing APIs.</p><p>APIs make integrations scalable because we can rely on standards and don't have to understand every detail of a system.
E.g. if an API speaks GraphQL, clients know already how to interact with the system.
We can understand the API by issuing an introspection Query and from there on use the Queries and Mutations defined in the GraphQL schema.</p><p>Without tools like GraphQL, we had to invent custom contracts and integration tooling for every API.</p><p>One important aspect of the success of an API is its design.
APIs must be able to cover common use cases of API consumers.
E.g. a weather API is useless if it's almost impossible to get forecasts for the next few days in a very easy way.</p><p>Next, we'll look into API design to further understand why generated APIs don't scale.</p><h2>On good API design<a href="#on-good-api-design" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Going back to the weather forecast service, we talked about success factors of the API.
An API can also be seen as a product as it serves a specific purpose.</p><p>How can a weather forecast API be successful?
As with any other product, you have to talk to your users and adapt to their needs.
You have to re-shape your product to serve your customers well.</p><p>In case of an API, re-shaping means finding a good API design.</p><p>And with that, we're at the core of the problem of generated APIs.</p><p>It's impossible to design an API when all you do is deriving it from e.g. database tables.
A good API is not just making raw data accessible. A good API is driven by use cases, making it easy to integrate.
It doesn't have to be a public facing API. If you're providing an API to other developers it should be designed around their use-cases.
Deriving APIs from database schemas, tables or whatever it is means, you're not designing, you're not focussing on your users.</p><p>The consequences are well described by Erik:</p><blockquote><p>If you're designing an API by avoiding designing it, you end up with the design you deserve.</p><p>-- <cite>Erik Wilde</cite></p></blockquote><p>If you skip the design phase, you'll end up with unhappy users.
If your company depends on the success of your APIs, this could be a deal breaker.</p><p>Imagine you're an engineer and your task is to build a new steering wheel for a car.
You'll take the whole description of the CAN-BUS (internal communication system) description of the car and "generate" a panel of knobs from it.
This steering wheel might have thousands of buttons and is barely usable.</p><p>Wouldn't it make more sense to figure out how people would want to steer a car?
What knobs they need on it to control the radio without losing control of the car?
Once you have figured out the requirements you could then start mocking a few designs.
With those designs you'd then go to users and test if they work they way you expect.
You'll then iterate your ideas until you find a good design.
Only then, you'll actually build a real steering wheel.
One that you're confident will solve the problem of your user.</p><p>What's different from a steering wheel and the API of your service?
Why is it not obvious that generated APIs don't solve the problem.</p><p>You'd be much faster generating a steering wheel because you don't have to spend time designing and implementing it.
If you're the only user of your steering wheel, this might work because you know all about CAN-BUS systems.
However, this approach won't scale if you want to build APIs for other teams and companies.</p><h2>Information hiding principle<a href="#information-hiding-principle" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Another important aspect of APIs is abstraction and information hiding.</p><p>API consumers should not have to think about the implementation.
But what if the API is leaking implementation details?</p><p>Let's have a look at this simple example:</p><p>Even if the language is GraphQL, it's clear that we're talking to a relational database and SQL is used behind the scenes.</p><p>Should an API consumer have to think about primary keys? Isn't that a concern of storing data, a completely different layer?</p><p>How about JSON selectors as arguments?</p><p>Isn't the implementation leaking information on how data is being stored?</p><p>Here's another example where GraphQL is being abused as an ORM.</p><p>The consequence of these examples is that it's almost impossible to make changes to the implementation.</p><p>Developers who know some basics on databases might see another problem with this approach.
In case of complex WHERE clauses (hello SQL) or aggregations, you have to make sure that the required indices exist on the database.
Otherwise, you'll run into full table scan problems.</p><p>I think it's clear that all these examples violate the principle of information hiding.</p><h2>Implementing APIs<a href="#implementing-apis" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>In the very beginning, we were looking at the developer experience of generated APIs and how much time you can save by not implementing the API but generating it.
We then learned that generated APIs generally don't scale well beyond personal projects because they are not driven by use cases.</p><p>Now, let's have a look at what actually makes a good API implementation.</p><p>A good API implementation decouples the API contract from data storage and other aspects like e.g. authentication.
A good API implementation allows you to change how you store data without breaking the API contract.
A good API also allows you to easily evolve and extend the contract for new use cases.
These three requirements are impossible to accomplish with generated APIs that are tightly coupled to infrastructure.</p><p>But there's one additional component that tops all of them: Business logic or state machines.
A good API doesn't force API consumers to implement their own state machine to interpret the data of the API.
Forcing API consumers to interpret raw data and derive state is prone to errors and should be avoided.</p><p>Let's have a closer look at state machines.</p><h2>State …</h2></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	

	<p>Open source licenses are in the news again. Elastic recently <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changed the licensing for ElasticSearch and Kibana</a> from Apache 2.0 to a choice of <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Server Side Public License</a> (SSPL) or the non-open source Elastic license. Like most open source licensing changes, this one prompted a lot of discussion. Examples <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25776657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25833781" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> include some of the more printable comments.&nbsp;</p><p>But we’re not here to discuss Elastic’s business model or their choice of license(s).&nbsp; We’re here to discuss ClickHouse licensing and Altinity’s view of it. Here’s the executive summary.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ClickHouse is Apache 2.0.&nbsp; Altinity is committed to ensuring it stays that way.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Our contributions to ClickHouse are<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Apache 2.0</a>. Our ecosystem projects like the ClickHouse Kubernetes operator are likewise Apache 2.0. We believe the Apache 2.0 license is best for our users. It’s also the best way to make ClickHouse the most popular SQL data warehouse on the planet. There are several reasons for our outlook.&nbsp;</p><p>The most important feature of Apache 2.0 is that it allows use for any purpose, which is the first of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four essential freedoms</a> of open source software. Such freedom is important for all applications, regardless of whether they run on-prem or as cloud services. Apache 2.0 opens the door to imaginative new services as well as creative paths to develop them. Installed&nbsp;applications morph into online services. Services that hide data behind APIs morph into open data. This freedom is key to enabling innovative new ways to incorporate analytics into applications, which in turn unlocks new business opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>Apache 2.0 is also a great license for contributors.&nbsp; It has been around since 2004, which is a long time in open source. Corporate legal departments understand it and can easily approve contributions from employees. Individual contributors understand the freedom Apache 2.0 confers to publish their work and use it freely in future. It’s a win-win: companies are motivated to make investment decisions in open source projects, and contributors are motivated to implement them.&nbsp;</p><p>Apache 2.0 licensing opens a path to increasing ClickHouse capabilities and worldwide use. More important, it is enabling a flood of innovation in analytic applications. In a crowded market with many database products besides ClickHouse, that’s a critical competitive advantage.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 id="h-apache-2-0-creates-a-level-playing-field">Apache 2.0 creates a level playing field</h2>
</p><p>Since the ClickHouse Apache 2.0 license places no restriction on business use, we can expect many competing services that leverage ClickHouse in one way or another.&nbsp; This includes hosted ClickHouse and value-added analytic services built on top of ClickHouse capabilities. It also extends to add-ons for countless existing services ranging from web analytics to network flow log management to financial asset valuation and everything in between.</p><p>The competition will be distressing for unprepared vendors, but it’s great for users. Competing services mean that users have alternatives. It also means that innovation is not random but focused on things that users care about: SQL features, performance, security, cost-efficiency, and time to market.&nbsp;</p><p>The same vendors that offer ClickHouse managed services have contributed popular features to ClickHouse like <a href="https://altinity.com/blog/clickhouse-and-s3-compatible-object-storage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S3 storage integration</a>, <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/operations/access-rights/#role-management" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Role-based Access Control</a>, <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/select/with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Common Table Expressions</a>, and many more. ClickHouse is experiencing the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coopetition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-opetition</a> feedback effect that helped fuel the success of Linux, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, and other open source projects.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 id="h-restrictive-licenses-like-sspl-are-antithetical-to-user-interests">Restrictive licenses like SSPL are antithetical to user interests</h2>
</p><p>The Server Side Public License is an attempt to set back the clock on open source software development. It rules out new SaaS offerings based on projects whose value&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote>
<p>…entirely or primarily derives from the value of the Program or modified version, or offering a service that accomplishes for users the primary purpose of the Program or modified version.&nbsp; (SSPL Section 13).&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
</div><p>The goal of the SSPL and similar licenses is nothing short of setting up monopoly providers of SaaS offerings. It has ambiguous terms–creating uncertainty for potential competitors–and onerous viral requirements. Services that fall under Section 13 must release all source code required to run the entire SaaS offering. That includes everything from the service management plane down to deployment and backup scripts. SSPL is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">copyleft</a> with fangs.&nbsp;</p><p>This obviously affects vendors trying to set up competing services to the copyright holders of SSPL projects. But the effect on the market is far wider.&nbsp; Analytics are pervasive in modern applications and SaaS is the primary way that software is now distributed. The SSPL potentially harms any user building an application who just wants a managed offering to take care of running it. We believe that’s an unacceptable limitation.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 id="h-but-wait-what-about-amazon">But wait, what about Amazon?</h2>
</p><p>Many vendors have justified <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/mongodb-switches-up-its-open-source-license/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open source relicensing as a necessary defense</a> against “strip mining” from public clouds. Aren’t we afraid of this ourselves? If so, it’s a bit late. There are already multiple cloud services for ClickHouse, including our own offering, <a href="https://altinity.com/cloud-database/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Altinity.Cloud</a>. There’s also <a href="https://cloud.yandex.com/services/managed-clickhouse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yandex.Cloud</a> and at least three services in China. New entrants need to compete by adding additional value, <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/07/08/suse-acquires-rancher-labs-reported-600m-chases-1b-revenue-goal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just as Rancher did</a> in the Apache 2.0-licensed Kubernetes market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our goal at Altinity is to help customers bring high-value analytic applications to market quickly and operate them cost-effectively. We focus on development efficiency, data privacy, world-class support, and operations. We do so on all platforms, both public cloud and on-prem. Anybody who has worked on such services knows there’s opportunity here to build many valuable companies, not just one.&nbsp;</p><p>Other paths are possible. Vendors may fork ClickHouse and try to add licenses that create a proprietary fortress. If so, we would point to some friendly advice from a famous competitive analyst of the Italian Renaissance:&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote>
<p><em>So the best fortress that exists is to avoid being hated by the people. If you have fortresses and the people hate you, they will not save you</em>.</p>
<p><cite><em>Niccolo Machiavelli, The Prince</em></cite></p></blockquote>
</div><p>We don’t want to build new fortresses to protect ourselves against our users. We want to tear them down. Apache 2.0 is the key to enabling a new generation of analytic applications based on ClickHouse. Altinity is all in.&nbsp;</p><p>P.S., If you are worried about ElasticSearch and Kibana switching licenses, this might be a nice time to look at alternatives. ClickHouse can store log data remarkably well. More on that in future articles.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>A close look at the psychology of wine, how marketing affects your perceptions, and why you’re paying too much for wine.</em></p>



<p>In 2002, four Wall Street businessmen sat down for dinner at the Balthazar in New York City. They ordered a Mouton Rothschild 1989 for the table.</p>



<p>The Balthazar menu lists this wine at $2,000. It’s not hard to see why. The Mouton Rothschild 1989 is an exceptional wine, produced from grapes grown on 205 acres near Pauillac, just northwest of Bordeaux. At the time the grapes were grown, the vineyard was owned by Philippine de Rothschild, a member of the infamous Rothschild family at the center of banking in Europe from the eighteenth century onward. According to the <a href="https://www.liz-palmer.com/wine-review-chateau-mouton-rothschild-1989/">tasting notes</a> of Liz Palmer, the noted wine critic, the Mouton Rothschild 1989 is “a lovely Pauillac that has reached its plateau of maturity; notably dark ruby in colour; It has an engaging cedar and tobacco bouquet with hints of mint; not much fruit concentration; the palate follows suit – is medium-bodied and continues the aromatic theme of cedar and tobacco; demonstrates great persistence; well-defined – ‘old school’.” At a tasting in 2018, Jane Anson, the Bordeaux correspondent for <em>Decanter </em>magazine, gave it 97 points out of a possible 100.</p>



<p>That was the wine they ordered.</p>



<p>But it wasn’t the wine they got.</p>



<p>Instead, their server brought them an $18 Pinot Noir.</p>



<p>There had been a mix-up. The staff had poured the two wines into two decanters and sent the wrong decanter to the table.</p>



<p>Five minutes later, the restaurant manager rushed to their table to explain what had happened.</p>



<p>How did they these businessmen react? With incredulity, that a restaurant could make such a costly mistake? That their dinner had been ruined?</p>



<p>Nope.</p>



<p>Though they suspected what they were drinking wasn’t the wine they had ordered, they didn’t realize they were drinking an $18 Pinot Noir.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, a few tables away, the beneficiaries of the mistake—a couple who ordered the $18 Pinot Noir—didn’t realize it, either. In fact, as they unknowingly drank the $2,000 Mouton Rothschild 1989 they “jokingly pretended to be drinking an expensive wine.”<span id="easy-footnote-1-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-65224613" title="Mercer, C. (2020) NY restaurant couple mistakenly served $2000 Mouton 1989 after ordering $18 Pinot. <em>Decanter</em>. October 22, 2020."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>



<p>How could this have happened?</p>



<p>Not the mistake in the kitchen: the swapped decanters, the wrong wine at the wrong tables.</p>



<p>The real mistake was a mistake in perception: that an $18 Pinot Noir and a $2,000 Mouton Rothschild 1989 could be confused in the first place.</p>



<p>In today’s post, we’re going to take a deep dive into the world of expensive wine. We’ll see if expensive wine really tastes better or if the mix-up at the Balthazar was a one-off mistake. We’ll explore the ways price signals quality. We’ll look at how expectations influence perceptions. And we’ll finish with a definitive guide to buying great wine.</p>



<p>Sometimes you can answer a question with a statement supported by data, science, and story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer to the question—<em>does expensive wine really taste better?</em>—is not such an answer. Instead, this answer is a series of layers, each one more complicated than the last, and each one introducing a new set of questions—and a new set of revelations about taste, status, and perception.</p>



<h2>People can’t tell the difference between expensive wine and cheap wine</h2>



<p>When people don’t know the price, they like cheap wine just as much as expensive wine.&nbsp;Between April 2007 and February 2008, Robin Goldstein and his colleagues conducted 6,175 blind tests with 506 participants tasting 523 wines that ranged in price from $1.65 to $150.00 per bottle. About 12% of the participants had taken a sommelier course or had some kind of training. The test was double-blind: neither the person drinking the wine nor the person serving the wine knew the price. After each taste, participants rated it either “Bad,” Okay,” “Good,” or “Great.” Goldstein found that, on the whole, people actually gave <em>higher </em>ratings for cheap wine than expensive wine. However, compared to non-experts, the experts rated expensive wine more favorably. It seems that everyone likes cheap wine more than expensive wine, though experts are better at rating expensive wines compared to non-experts.<span id="easy-footnote-2-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-65224613" title="Goldstein, R., Almenberg, J., Dreber, A., Emerson, J. W., Herschkowitsch, A., &amp;amp; Katz, J. (2008). Do more expensive wines taste better? Evidence from a large sample of blind tastings. <em>Journal of Wine Economics</em>, 3(1), 1-9."><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Other blind tastings have produced the same results. In 2011, Johan Almenberg and Anna Dreber of the Stockholm School of Economics had 135 people rate a $40 wine and 131 people rate a $5 wine, both on a scale of 1 to 100. They split the tasters into three groups:</p>



<ol><li>Some people learned the price <em>before </em>they tasted it.&nbsp;</li><li>Others learned the price <em>after </em>they tasted it, but before they rated it.&nbsp;</li><li>And a third group did a blind tasting: they never learned the price and only tasted and rated the wine.</li></ol>



<p>Of this third group, people rated the cheap wine a 60.0 and the expensive wine a 58.5. To them, the $5 wine tasted better than the $40 wine!<span id="easy-footnote-3-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-65224613" title="Almenberg, J., &amp;amp; Dreber, A. (2011).

<p>For many people, a $40 wine sounds expensive. But for others, such as sommeliers, wine critics, and others, a $40 wine is still well below the threshold of what a great wine should cost. What if we compare a $40 wine (expensive to some, but cheap to others) to a $400 or $4,000 wine? In 2013, Vanessa Harrar and her colleagues conducted a blind tasting of seven sparkling wines, including six Champagnes. There were fifteen tasters, including four who considered themselves experts and five who considered themselves novices. This tasting, too, revealed no correlation between price and rating. Cheap Champagnes taste better than expensive Champagnes. In fact, of the wines sampled, the lowest rating was a Perrier-Jouët Belle Epoque Blanc de Blanc 2002, priced at £400; while the highest rated wines were a Mumm Vintage 2004 (£40) and a Perrier-Jouet Belle Epoque 2004 (£100). It seems that not only do cheap wines taste the same as expensive wines, but expensive wines taste the same as <em>very</em> expensive wines, too. <span id="easy-footnote-4-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-65224613" title="Harrar, V., Smith, B., Deroy, O. et al. Grape expectations: how the proportion of white grape in Champagne affects the ratings of experts and social drinkers in a blind tasting. <em>Flavour </em>2, 25 (2013)."><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Follow-up studies confirmed this. The next year, Robert H. Ashton published the results of his tasting session in the <em>Journal of Wine Economics</em>. In his study, 48 people, all members of a wine appreciation club at Duke University, tasted six wines each. They rated each wine on a scale of 1 to 10. As before, people thought the cheaper wines tasted better. In fact, in one of the tastings, the most expensive wine (a $119 bottle) was ranked a 3.70 and the cheapest wine (a $22 bottle) was ranked a 4.00.<span id="easy-footnote-5-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-65224613" title="Ashton, R.

<p>These and numerous other studies point in the same direction: in blind taste tests, people can’t distinguish cheap wine from expensive wine.</p>



<h2>People can’t tell the difference between two wines</h2>



<p>There’s a deeper issue, though. The real reason people can’t distinguish expensive wine from cheap wine is because they can’t distinguish <em>any </em>wine from <em>any other</em> wine—at least at rates that are no better than chance. In a series of two tastings, Roman Weil, the former co-chairman of the Oenonomy Society of the US, poured two wines into four glasses: one wine split between two glasses and the other wine split between the other two glasses. Then, he took one of the four glasses away, and served the remaining three glasses in the tasting. Thus, two of the three glasses were poured from the same bottle, and one of the three glasses from its own bottle. (If this is getting confusing, scroll down to the image.) Weil asked people to identify which two were the same and which one was different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How did people do?</p>



<p>Not great.</p>



<p>In the first tasting, people identified the wines from the same vintage only 41.5% of the time. That’s not very good when you consider that people would correctly pick the two wines from the same bottle 33.3% of the time if they made decisions at random: there are three glasses, so picking the two of three glasses at random would be correct 1 in 3 times. <span id="easy-footnote-6-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-65224613" title="Weil, R.L. (2001). Parker v. Prial: The death of the vintage chart. <em>Chance</em>, 14, 27–3"><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Weil’s second tasting produced similar results. This time, Weil had 395 people compare 855 pairs of regular wines and reserve wines, which are usually produced from superior grapes. People correctly identified only 346 of the 855 pairs, or roughly 40.5% of pairs, compared to the 33.3% that would be expected from random chance. Then, in a final step, Weil asked the 346 people who got it right to tell him which wine was the regular wine, and which wine was the reserve—the purportedly better wine. Of the 346 people, 170 people (49.1%) preferred the regular wine and 176 (50.9%) preferred the reserve—rates that are virtually the same as picking one of the wines at random (50.0%).<span id="easy-footnote-7-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-7-65224613" title="Weil, R.L.

<p>Weil’s studies show that people can tell two wines apart at rates that are barely better than chance (1 in 3) , and when they can, they pick the better wine at rates equal to chance (1 in 2).</p>



<p>Wine is an acquired taste. It takes time, training, and practice to tell good wine from bad (which could, itself, be evidence that great wine isn’t objectively great, though I digress). Perhaps expert tasters would perform better?</p>



<p>Unfortunately not. Professionals don’t do any better than novices: even people who are trained to taste, describe, and recommend wine for a living—and whose recommendations carry enormous weight within the industry and beyond—can’t tell one wine from another in a blind test. One of the first studies to reveal these inconsistencies took place at the wine competition of the California State Fair between 2005 and 2008. The competition is the oldest in the United States, and its judges include, “winemakers, wine buyers, wine critics and professors of enology and viticulture,” according to Robert T. Hodgson, the retired statistics professor and 35-year owner of the Fieldbrook Winery in California who conducted the study. Wineries are happy to pay more than $1 million collectively in entry fees to have their wine judged at the fair, since a gold medal awarded by judges at the fair can propel an unknown wine to the top of the market.<span id="easy-footnote-8-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-8-65224613" title="Hodgson, R.T.

<p>Typically, judges at the state fair taste between four and six flights of wine per day, and each flight contains 30 wines. However, Hodgson served them a second flight that contained …</p></div></article></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In this post, I introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariant_formulation_of_classical_electromagnetism">covariant electrodynamics</a> in the least painful way I know: by extending the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_product#Vector_triple_product">vector triple product</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space">Minkowski spacetime</a>. The reader is assumed to have some familiarity with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-vector">four-vectors</a> and Euclidean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus">vector calculus</a>, but we won’t use any index gymnastics or explicit rank-2 tensors; just four-vectors. (In <a href="https://michaelallenwarner.github.io/physics/2020/03/31/electrodyadics.html">Part II</a> we’ll use dyadics, which are like “tensors lite.”)</p>

<p>I developed this approach myself, and I’ve found no other sources that employ it. If you’ve seen it elsewhere, please let me know (email address at the bottom of the page).</p>

<h2 id="mathematical-preliminaries">Mathematical Preliminaries</h2>

<h3 id="the-bac---cab-rule">The “bac - cab” Rule</h3>

<p>In three-dimensional Euclidean space, we have this lovely vector identity:</p><p>

\[\mathbf a \times (\mathbf b \times \mathbf c) = \mathbf b (\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf c) - \mathbf c (\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b) .\]

</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product">cross product</a> \(\mathbf b \times \mathbf c\) is perpendicular to \(\mathbf b\) and \(\mathbf c\) and defined only in three dimensions (where an axis that’s orthogonal to a pair of vectors is unique). The vector triple product \(\mathbf a \times (\mathbf b \times \mathbf c)\), on the other hand, is a linear combination of \(\mathbf b\) and \(\mathbf c\), which is to say that it’s a vector that <em>lies in the plane they span</em> (its direction is given by the projection of \(\mathbf a\) onto that plane, rotated 90° in the \(\mathbf c\)-to-\(\mathbf b\) sense—see the illustration below <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Cross_product_triple.svg">from Wikipedia</a>, but don’t let it mislead you into thinking that the vector’s <em>magnitude</em> is necessarily equal to that of \(\mathbf a\)’s projection onto the plane). So although the cross product is restricted to three-dimensional Euclidean space, there’s nothing stopping us from using the “bac - cab” combination in other contexts.</p>

</p>

<h3 id="four-vector-triple-product">Four-Vector Triple Product</h3>

<p>Accordingly, we can define a “vector triple product” in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime:</p><p>

\[\mathbf A \; \text{“} \mkern-5mu \times (\mathbf B \times \mkern-5mu \text{”} \, \mathbf C) = \mathbf B (\mathbf A \cdot \mathbf C) - \mathbf C (\mathbf A \cdot \mathbf B).\]

</p><p>Here the dot means the <em>Minkowski</em> dot product (we’ll use capital letters for four-vectors in this post), and the scare quotes on the left side remind us that the cross product itself isn’t actually defined in Minkowski spacetime (don’t take the \(\times\) notation literally!).</p>

<p>If you need a refresher, a four-vector in standard Minkowski coordinates has one time component and three Cartesian spatial components that together obey the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation">Lorentz transformation</a>. Adopting the \((+, -, -, -)\) sign convention, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-vector#Standard_basis,_(+%E2%88%92%E2%88%92%E2%88%92)_signature">Minkowski dot product</a> of \(\mathbf Q = (Q^t, Q^x, Q^y, Q^z) = (Q^t, \mathbf q)\) and \(\mathbf W = (W^t, \mathbf w)\) is:</p><p>

\[\mathbf Q \cdot \mathbf W = Q^t W^t - (\mathbf q \cdot \mathbf w) ,\]

</p><p>where \(\mathbf q \cdot \mathbf w = q_x w_x + q_y w_y + q_z w_z = Q^x W^x + Q^y W^y + Q^z W^z\) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">Euclidean dot product</a> (we’ll use superscript indices for four-vector components and subscript indices for three-vector components).</p>

<h3 id="adding-curl-to-the-mix">Adding Curl to the Mix</h3>

<p>A special case of the vector triple product is when the “inner” cross product is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics)">curl</a> of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field">vector field</a> \(\mathbf c = \mathbf c (\mathbf r)\) (using \(\mathbf r\) for the position vector):</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\mathbf a \times (\del \times \mathbf c) &amp;= \del _{\mathbf c} (\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf c) - \mathbf c (\mathbf a \cdot \del _{\mathbf c}) \\[3pt]
&amp;= \del _{\mathbf c} (\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf c) - (\mathbf a \cdot \del) \mathbf c ,
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus_identities#Special_notations">subscript</a> indicates that \(\del\) (“del”) operates on \(\mathbf c\) and only on \(\mathbf c\), regardless of its placement in a term. Note that because the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus_identities#Curl_of_gradient_is_zero">curl of a gradient</a> is always the zero vector, this differential vector triple product is unchanged by a transformation that takes \(\mathbf c\) to (\(\mathbf c + \del f\)) for <em>any</em> scalar field \(f = f (\mathbf r)\):</p><p>

\[\mathbf a \times [\del \times (\mathbf c + \del f)] = \mathbf a \times (\del \times \mathbf c) ,\]

</p><p>or using the “bac - cab” expansion:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\mathbf a \times [\del \times (\mathbf c + \del f)] &amp;= \del _{\mathbf c \, + \del f} \, [\mathbf a \cdot (\mathbf c + \del f)] - (\mathbf a \cdot \del) (\mathbf c + \del f) \\[3pt]
&amp;= \del _{\mathbf c} (\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf c) + \del _{f} (\mathbf a \cdot \del f) - (\mathbf a \cdot \del) \mathbf c - (\mathbf a \cdot \del) \del f \\[3pt]
&amp;= \del _{\mathbf c} (\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf c) - (\mathbf a \cdot \del) \mathbf c \\[3pt]
&amp;= \mathbf a \times (\del \times \mathbf c),
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>because for the scalar \(f\) we have \(\del _{f} (\mathbf a \cdot \del f) = \del _{f} (\mathbf a \cdot \del) f = (\mathbf a \cdot \del) \del f\) (if you need convincing write it out in terms of components).</p>

<p>The “four-del” is:</p><p>

\[\vecpartial = \left( \frac{1}{c} \, \frac{\partial}{\partial t} , \, - \del \right)\]

</p><p>(\(c\) is the speed of light, and yes, that’s a negative sign—without it the four “components” <a href="http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_25.html#Ch25-S3">wouldn’t obey the Lorentz transformation</a> and thus wouldn’t together constitute a four-vector operator). With \(\mathbf R\) as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-vector#Four-position">four-position</a>, the <em>Minkowski</em> differential vector triple product for a four-vector field \(\mathbf C = \mathbf C ( \mathbf R )\) is:</p><p>

\[\mathbf A \; \text{“} \mkern-5mu \times (\vecpartial \times \mkern-5mu \text{”} \, \mathbf C) = \vecpartial _{\mathbf C} (\mathbf A \cdot \mathbf C) - (\mathbf A \cdot \vecpartial) \mathbf C .\]

</p><p>The resulting vector is likewise unchanged by a transformation that takes \(\mathbf C\) to (\(\mathbf C + \vecpartial F\)) for any spacetime scalar field \(F = F (\mathbf R)\), though now we can <em>only</em> show this with the “bac - cab” side:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\mathbf A \; \text{“} \mkern-5mu \times [ \vecpartial \times \mkern-5mu \text{”} \, ( \mathbf C + \vecpartial F ) ] &amp;= \vecpartial _{\mathbf C \, + \, \vecpartial F} \, [\mathbf A \cdot (\mathbf C + \vecpartial F)] - (\mathbf A \cdot \vecpartial) (\mathbf C + \vecpartial F) \\[3pt]
&amp;= \vecpartial _{\mathbf C} (\mathbf A \cdot \mathbf C) + (\mathbf A \cdot \vecpartial) \vecpartial F - (\mathbf A \cdot \vecpartial) \mathbf C - (\mathbf A \cdot \vecpartial) \vecpartial F \\[3pt]
&amp;= \vecpartial _{\mathbf C} (\mathbf A \cdot \mathbf C) - (\mathbf A \cdot \vecpartial) \mathbf C \\[3pt]
&amp;= \mathbf A \; \text{“} \mkern-5mu \times (\vecpartial \times \mkern-5mu \text{”} \, \mathbf C).
\end{aligned}\]

</p><h3 id="the-double-curl">The Double Curl</h3>

<p>Then there’s the <em>extra</em> special case of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus_identities#Curl_of_curl">curl of the curl</a>, which outputs a vector <em>field</em>:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\del \times (\del \times \mathbf c) &amp;= \del (\del \cdot \mathbf c) - (\del \cdot \del) \mathbf c \\[2pt]
&amp;= \del (\del \cdot \mathbf c) - \nabla^2 \mathbf c ,
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>with \(\nabla^2 = \del \cdot \del\) as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_Laplacian">(vector) Laplacian</a>, a scalar operator. The four-vector “double curl” is:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\vecpartial \; \text{“} \mkern-5mu \times (\vecpartial \times \mkern-5mu \text{”} \, \mathbf C) &amp;= \vecpartial (\vecpartial \cdot \mathbf C) - (\vecpartial \cdot \vecpartial) \mathbf C \\[2pt]
&amp;= \vecpartial (\vecpartial \cdot \mathbf C) - \Box \mathbf C ,
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>with \(\Box = \vecpartial \cdot \vecpartial\) as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Alembert_operator">d’Alembertian</a>. Taking \(\mathbf C\) to (\(\mathbf C + \vecpartial F\)) here looks like:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\vecpartial \; \text{“} \mkern-5mu \times [ \vecpartial \times \mkern-5mu \text{”} \, ( \mathbf C + \vecpartial F ) ] &amp;= \vecpartial [\vecpartial \cdot (\mathbf C + \vecpartial F)] - \Box (\mathbf C + \vecpartial F) \\[3pt]
&amp;= \vecpartial (\vecpartial \cdot \mathbf C) + \vecpartial \Box F - \Box \mathbf C - \Box \vecpartial F \\[3pt]
&amp;= \vecpartial (\vecpartial \cdot \mathbf C) - \Box \mathbf C \\[3pt]
&amp;= \vecpartial \; \text{“} \mkern-5mu \times (\vecpartial \times \mkern-5mu \text{”} \, \mathbf C) ,
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>where we’ve used \(\Box \vecpartial = \vecpartial \Box\) (because \(\Box\) is a scalar operator).</p>

<h2 id="covariant-electrodynamics-four-vectors-only">Covariant Electrodynamics, Four-Vectors Only</h2>

<p>The physics is really pretty simple now. We’ll do this in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz%E2%80%93Heaviside_units">Heaviside–Lorentz units</a>.</p>

<h3 id="four-current-density-four-potential-lorenz-gauge">Four-Current Density, Four-Potential, Lorenz Gauge</h3>

<p>Charge- and current-densities together constitute a four-vector \(\mathbf J = (\rho, \, \mathbf j / c)\) called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-current">four-current density</a>, which is the electromagnetic source field. (Usually it’s defined as \((\rho c , \, \mathbf j)\), but dividing by \(c\) now saves us from having to divide \(\mathbf J\) by \(c\) later when it appears in other equations.) We then define the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_four-potential">four-potential</a> \(\mathbf A\) as any four-vector field whose (negative) “double curl” is the four-current density:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\mathbf J &amp;= - \vecpartial \; \text{“} \mkern-5mu \times (\vecpartial \times \mkern-5mu \text{”} \, \mathbf A) \\[2pt]
&amp;= \Box \mathbf A - \vecpartial (\vecpartial \cdot \mathbf A) .
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>We haven’t yet established why we’d care about the four-potential, but this equation tells us how the “value” of \(\mathbf A\) at a given spacetime location is determined by the value of \(\mathbf J\) elsewhere in spacetime. Scare quotes around <em>value</em> because \(\mathbf A\) isn’t uniquely defined: remember, the above differential triple product is unchanged by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory#Classical_electromagnetism">“gauge” transformation</a> that takes \(\mathbf A\) to (\(\mathbf A + \vecpartial \psi\)) for <em>any</em> spacetime scalar field \(\psi\). And look what happens if we choose a \(\psi\) that satisfies \(\Box \psi = - \vecpartial \cdot \mathbf A\):</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\Box ( \mathbf A + \vecpartial \psi ) - \vecpartial [ \vecpartial \cdot ( \mathbf A + \vecpartial \psi ) ] &amp;= \Box ( \mathbf A + \vecpartial \psi ) - \vecpartial ( \vecpartial \cdot \mathbf A + \Box \psi ) \\[2pt]
&amp;= \Box (\mathbf A + \vecpartial \psi) .
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>We’re left with just a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation">wave equation</a> for the “new” four-potential \(\mathbf A + \vecpartial \psi\), which we see is divergenceless: \(\vecpartial \cdot (\mathbf A + \vecpartial \psi) = 0\). Making this transformation is called imposing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_gauge_condition">Lorenz gauge</a>, and it’s always possible to do. For any <em>divergenceless</em> \(\mathbf A\), then:</p><p>

<p>It is assumed that the reader has installed node &amp; yarn before proceeding further.</p>
<p>Let's get to work.</p>
<h2>Bootstrapping a barebones mod</h2>
<p>The following command can be run to bootstrap a fresh mod project <em>automatically</em>:</p>
<!-- <Shell children='$ yarn create factorio-mod <mod-name>' /> -->
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn create factorio-mod &lt;mod-name&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>For demonstration purposes, I will create a mod called <code>vroom</code>. This mod will make the character accelerate as he runs, allowing the player to travel at warp speed!</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn create factorio-mod vroom</span>
...
Victory! Your mod is ready to roll. Execute the following commands to get going:
  - cd "/Users/cdaringe/src/vroom"
  - yarn start
✨  Done in 5.75s.</code></pre>
<p>This step automatically installs the aforementioned dependencies and sets up the compiler toolchain.
If you want to do these steps manually, please see the <a href="https://github.com/cdaringe/vroom">vroom</a> codebase, and replicate the artifacts hosted there. <a href="https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vroom">@mods.factorio.com</a></p>
<h2>Understanding the barebones mod</h2>
<p>Let us <code>cd "path/to/vroom"</code>, and study the content. If you
are familiar with the <a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/Tutorial:Mod_structure">factorio mod directory stucture</a>,
this should look quite familiar.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>info.json</code> - the entrypont to all factorio mods, pre-populated with some essentials</li>
<li><code>control.ts</code> - this file will compile to <code>control.lua</code>, which Factorio uses to run your mod!</li>
<li><code>tsconfig.json</code> - typescript configuration, critically including <a href="https://typescripttolua.github.io/docs/configuration">TypescriptToLua configuration</a></li>
<li><code>package.json</code> &amp; <code>node_modules</code> - resources to support your TS development experience :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's open up <code>control.ts</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onTick = <span>(<span>_evt: OnTickPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  game.print(serpent.block({
    <span>hello</span>: <span>"world"</span>,
    <span>its_nice</span>: <span>"to see you"</span>
  }));
};

script.on_event(defines.events.on_tick, onTick);</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>script.on_event</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>game</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>serpent</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>evt</code> - typed, via casting</li>
</ul>
<p>Boom! Types for everything!</p>
<p>...but not quite. The Factorio Lua documentation is <em>lossy</em>, and has many cases where we simply <em>cannot</em> parse correct type definitions from the Factorio website. Until the factorio development team publicly supports  machine-readable API documentation, <code>factorio-type-kit</code> TypeScript provisions will generally only be 70-80%+ complete. Thus, TypeScript users will be periodically disappointed to find <code>any</code> or <code>unknown</code> types in various interfaces. With that said, <code>factorio-type-kit</code> users are welcome to manually backfill essential definitions to make our community's development kit better.</p>
<h2>Starting the mod compiler</h2>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn start</span></code></pre>
<p>Momentarily after launching the watching compiler, <code>control.lua</code> should be emitted. Open it up:</p>
<pre><code>onTick = <span><span>function</span><span>(_evt)</span></span>
    game.<span>print</span>(
        serpent.block({hello = <span>"world"</span>, its_nice = <span>"to see you"</span>})
    )
<span>end</span>
script.on_event(defines.events.on_tick, onTick)</code></pre>
<p>The TypeScriptToLua compiler does a fanstastic job on producing readable Lua.</p>
<h2>Implementing vroom</h2>
<p>The very first thing the <code>vroom</code> mod needs to do is detect when the player is in motion.</p>
<p>Rather that pull up the documentation, I'll just open up another call <code>script.on_event</code>, then
begin typing in <code>defines.events.</code>. After intellisense presents me options, I will select <code>on_player_changed_position</code>. The type definitions tell me a callback is also required. I will enter in <code>onPositionChanged</code>.</p>
<pre><code>script.on_event(
  defines.events.on_player_changed_position,
  onPositionChange
);</code></pre>
<p><code>onPositionChange</code> is not defined yet. Let's discuss what it needs to do then draft it.
First, it needs to get the player's current speed. Next, the speed needs to increase when running. Because the purpose of the mod is to accelerate the user, we multiply the previous speed by a scalar every so often.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onPositionChange = <span>(<span>evt: OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>const</span> player = game.get_player(evt.player_index);
  <span>if</span> (player.walking_state.walking) {
    
  }
};</code></pre>
<p>Immediately take note that we have manually specified the type of <code>evt</code> as <code>OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</code>. All factorio script event types follow the event naming convention: <code>&lt;CamelCased-EventName&gt;Payload</code>. A future version may automatically apply types to the <code>on_event</code> callback, so you not need cast.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed was that <code>evt</code> did not have a reference directly to the player I needed.
It does contain the <code>player_id</code> however, and with that ID we can call the <code>get_player</code> method on the global <code>game</code> instance. <code>get_player</code> returns an instance of a <code>LuaPlayer</code>, contains a <code>walking_state</code> property. Let's use <em>that</em>. We know that we <em>only</em> want to speed up the player if he is in motion, so let's further wrap our logic inside a conditional--<code>if (player.walking_state.walking) { ... }</code>.</p>
<p>Next up, how do we actually speed up the player? After searching the API documentation, I concluded that there was not a direct value specifying a velocity of the character. However, I did come across <code>character_running_speed_modifier</code>, which the type definitions told me is of type <code>number</code>. Unexpectedly, through trial and error, I learned that <code>character_running_speed_modifier</code> could be zero. <code>Speed * 0 = 0</code>, so Factorio likely does a 0 check internally before calculating the player's speed. We will have to do a similar check. Notice that typescript did not me help uncover my bug! Anything of type <code>number</code> can rightfully be zero, so shame on me! Defensive programmers everywhere are saying "you should have seen this coming", and they would be correct :). Equipped with this knowledge, let's fill in the rest.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onPositionChange = <span>(<span>evt: OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>const</span> player = game.get_player(evt.player_index);
  <span>if</span> (player.walking_state.walking) {
    <span>const</span> lastSpeed = player.character_running_speed_modifier;
    <span>const</span> baseSpeed = lastSpeed == <span>0</span> ? <span>1</span> : lastSpeed;
    player.character_running_speed_modifier = baseSpeed * <span>1.01</span>;
  }
};</code></pre>
<p>When our player stops running, we want to restart the acceleration process for the next time he runs.
My original approach was to listen for <code>keyup</code> events. Alas, Factorio has no key events. How else could I determine if the player has stopped running, and thus safely reset the speed modifier? Easy! On every tick of the game, I can check all players for motion--and turn off the multiplier if they are stopped!</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onTick = <span>(<span>_evt: OnTickPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>Object</span>.entries(game.players).forEach(<span>(<span>[_id, player]</span>) =&gt;</span> {
    <span>if</span> (
      player.character_running_speed_modifier &gt; <span>0</span> &amp;&amp;
      !player.walking_state.walking
    ) {
      player.character_running_speed_modifier = <span>0</span>;
    }
  });
};</code></pre>
<p>That is, for every player, if there is a positive speed modifier and and the player is not walking, zero out the modifier.</p>
<p>Why didn't we just do a <code>game.players.forEach</code>? <code>game.players</code> isn't an array, so that won't work. TypeScript protected us from making that mistake! What about <code>Object.entries(game.players).forEach</code>? Yep, that worked! Why did we not do <code>Object.values(...)</code>? Because <code>game.players</code> is a <a href="https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/LuaGameScript.html#LuaGameScript.players">special dictionary</a> in Lua. Not all iterables map cleanly between languages. <code>Object.values(...)</code> wouldn't have given us compiler error, but still would have failed. Improved typing is needed to protect against these failures. While TypeScriptToLua generally helps out a great deal protect us from writing erroneous code, it is only as good as its applied type constraints.</p>
<p>When using JS standard library provisions, as we did above, the compiler will add a typescript-lua polyfill, <code>lualib_bundle</code>. The emitted Lua perhaps is not as elegant:</p>
<pre><code><span>require</span>(<span>"lualib_bundle"</span>);

onTick = <span><span>function</span><span>(_evt)</span></span>
    __TS__ArrayForEach(
        __TS__ObjectEntries(game.players),
        <span><span>function</span><span>(____, ____bindingPattern0)</span></span>
            <span>local</span> _id = ____bindingPattern0[<span>1</span>]
            <span>local</span> player
            player = ____bindingPattern0[<span>2</span>]
            <span>if</span> (player.character_running_speed_modifier &gt; <span>0</span>) <span>and</span> (<span>not</span> player.walking_state.walking) <span>then</span>
                player.character_running_speed_modifier = <span>0</span>
            <span>end</span>
        <span>end</span>
    )
<span>end</span></code></pre>
<p>Even with the extra boilerplate generated, the code is still quite readable. Could be cleaner! Surely as the TypeScriptToLua compiler evolves in time, it will be.</p>
<h2>Deploy it</h2>
<p>I do not yet have clean, polished package &amp; deploy scripts, but I do have functional ones.
Do your best to cover your eyes. Running <code>yarn install_mod</code> syncs the mod into the local Factorio installation. Coupled with a watch script, every code change immediately syncs in the game folder, and requires only a scenario reload to exercise the new scripts.</p>
<pre><code>"scripts": {
  "clean:install": "rm -rf ~/Library/Application\\ Support/factorio/mods/vroom*",
  "copy:install": "VERSION=$(cat info.json | jq -r .version) &amp;&amp; rsync -r --exclude node_modules --exclude '.git*' --exclude build --exclude 'npm*' --exclude README.md --exclude package.json --exclude '*.lock'  ./ ~/Library/Application\\ Support/factorio/mods/vroom_$VERSION/",

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As I was sitting at work, coming up with a way to solve some synchronization issue between our relational database and a search index, it got me thinking… Is it possible to have a database that can handle this stuff for me, the way, for example, Postgres handles the creation and maintenance of an index? Just one <strong>CREATE INDEX</strong> away from efficient and fast queries. What about a database that can serve every need: storing and reading data effectively, scaling smoothly as the workload increases, being able to run complex searches, do batch and stream processing for analytical purposes and work with every other access pattern we can imagine.</p><p>Almost any organization that handles data uses a relational database in its stack. It makes sense, it’s a battle-tested technology that stood the test of time. For a large percent of the applications, the need won’t arise for a different kind of data system. Take Postgres for example: it’s highly scalable, it has transactions with ACID properties, materialized views, supports partitioning and replication, joins, views, triggers, stored procedures, hot backups, all that kind of stuff. We can go
along way with it without having to worry about problems with the dataflow in our system. But of course, not all data models are suitable for Postgres, and even though it supports things like full-text searches and JSON columns, some times it is more suitable or easier even, to use different technology.</p><p>But even though relational databases have come a very long way, still they are not designed to handle every possible workload, so we resort to having to combine multiple systems to handle this broad variety: we use Redis for caching, Elasticsearch for searching, Kafka for stream processing, and many more similar tools and technologies, each of them serving a very narrow purpose in handling our different use cases.</p><p>But is there a way to unify the interface across these systems?</p><p>These technologies are great at what they do, we just need something that nicely ties them together instead of putting that burden on our applications. Putting the application in this role is too much of a responsibility, storing and transporting the data from one place to another as well as handling all of the business logic is a sure way of making those systems permanently inconsistent with each other.</p><p>Instead, if we can figure out a way of making these diverse components work nicely together, we will have a much more reliable solution. Kinda like the pipe in Unix, allowing the user to compose different workflows together out of simpler programs, by sending the output of one command to another, for further processing.</p><p>Now I know there are tools today that handle some of these cases that I mentioned, and they are getting better each day, but they’re far from simple to operate and maintain, and more importantly, they’re not of declarative nature.</p><p>Instead of relying on tools, is it possible to have some abstraction akin to SQL, some declarative language that will hide away the complexities of storing and synchronizing the data across the different data systems, making it easier to combine the disparate technologies, while also providing escape hatches in case the need arises to access the underlying storage directly?</p><p>Taking inspiration from the UNIX philosophy which emphasizes building complex systems out of simpler, extensible, and modular components, can we apply the same principles here, to our future data systems?</p></div></div>]]>

                            For many children of the '80s, a good portion of your childhood probably revolved around sitting too close to the TV, clutching a plastic safety cone-colored hand gun and blasting waterfowl out of a pixilated sky in <em>Duck Hunt </em>(also, trying to blow that dog’s head off when he laughed at you). The <em>Duck Hunt</em> gun, officially called the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Zapper, seems downright primitive next to the Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s Kinect, but in the late 80s, it filled plenty of young heads with wonder. How did that thing work?
                        
</p><h4>Annie Get Your Zapper</h4><p>
    
                            The Zapper’s ancestry goes back to the mid 1930s, when the first so-called “light guns” appeared after the development of light-sensing vacuum tubes. In the first light gun game, <a href="http://www.pinrepair.com/arcade/rayolit.htm">Ray-O-Lite</a> (developed in 1936 by Seeburg, a company that made parts and systems for jukeboxes), players shot at small moving targets mounted with light sensors using a gun that emitted a beam of light. When the beam struck a sensor, the targets – ducks, coincidentally – registered the “hit” and a point was scored.
                        
</p><p>
    
                            Light guns hit home video game consoles with <em>Shooting Gallery</em> on the Magnavox Odyssey in 1972. Because the included shotgun-style light gun was only usable on a Magnavox television, the game flopped. The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Zapper then fell into the hands of American kids in October 1985, when it was released in a bundle with the NES, a controller and a few games. Early versions of the peripheral were dark gray, but the color of the sci-fi ray gun-inspired Zapper was changed a few years later when a federal regulation required that toy and imitation firearms be “blaze orange” (color #12199, to be exact) so they wouldn’t be mistaken for the real deal.
                        
</p><p>
    
                            While there were a number of Zapper-compatible games released for the NES (when I was a kid and my dad worked from home, we wasted plenty of afternoons away playing <em>Hogan’s Alley</em>), most lived in the shadow of the iconic <em>Duck Hunt</em>, the most recognizable and popular Zapper game.
                        
</p><h4>Gone in a Flash</h4><p>
    
                            While older light guns like the Ray-O-Lite rifle emitted beams of light, the Zapper and many other recent light guns work by receiving light through a photodiode on or in the barrel and using that light to figure out where on the TV screen you're aiming.
                        
</p><p>
    
                            This target flashing method helped Nintendo overcome a weakness of older light gun games: cheaters racking up high scores by pointing the gun at a steady light source, like a lamp, and hitting the first target right out of the gate.

<p><span>March 17, 2014</span>
</p>
<p>Remember <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/" rel="nofollow">Galton’s experiments on visual imagination?</a> Some people just don’t have it. And they never figured it out. They assumed no one had it, and when people talked about being able to picture objects in their minds, they were speaking metaphorically.
</p>
<p>And the people who <em>did</em> have good visual imaginations didn’t catch them. The people without imaginations mastered this “metaphorical way of talking” so well that they passed for normal. No one figured it out until Galton sat everyone down together and said “Hey, can we be really really clear about exactly how literal we’re being here?” and everyone realized they were describing different experiences.
</p>
<p>I thought about this recently during a conversation with Ozy:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> I am currently eating chickpeas and rice and I am <em>delighted</em> by the fact that I can eat this <em>whenever I want</em>. The nice thing about DISCOVERING YOUR FOOD PREFERENCES is that suddenly all the food in my cupboards is food I like and am looking forward to eating. And usually I get food I like by, like, luck? So this is excitement.
</p>
<p><strong>Scott:</strong> I don’t understand, why didn’t you buy things like that before?
</p>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> It took me a while to have enough of a sense of the food I like for “make a list of the food I like” to be a viable grocery-list-making strategy.
</p>
<p><strong>Scott:</strong> I’ve got to admit I’m confused and intrigued by your “don’t know my own preferences” thing.
</p>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> Hrm. Well, it’s sort of like… you know how sometimes you pretend to like something because it’s high-status, and if you do it well enough you <em>actually believe</em> you like the thing? Unless I pay a lot of attention <em>all</em> my preferences end up being not “what I actually enjoy” but like “what is high status” or “what will keep people from getting angry at me”
</p>
<p><strong>Scott:</strong> How does that apply to food?
</p>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> Well, sometimes people will tell you a certain food is high-status or healthy or a thing that everyone enjoys, and then I would like it. And a lot of times I just ate whatever was in front of me or ordered whatever the cheapest vegetarian thing on the menu was. And I… sort of vaguely had a sense that some things were more pleasurable to eat than other things but I didn’t like <em>keep track</em> of what they were or anything. Because if I knew I might like the <em>wrong things</em>. And also because I didn’t intuitively grasp that the “liking” thing everyone was talking about was related to pleasure and not to like popularity/status.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So the fact that people talk about what foods they like about a zillion times a day isn’t enough to make everyone realize liking foods is a thing.
</p>
<p>But it gets worse. A high school friend posted on Facebook a link to <a href="http://www.quora.com/Graduate-School/Is-going-for-a-Ph-D-worth-it-if-Im-extremely-passionate-about-a-field-but-dont-really-want-to-spend-my-20s-poor-toiling-away-in-a-lab-and-living-in-a-city-that-I-dont-particularly-want-to-live-in/answer/Mark-Eichenlaub?srid=slK&amp;share=1" rel="nofollow">a really interesting answer on Quora</a>. It makes you log on, so I’ll copy the relevant part below:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have anosmia, which means I lack smell the way a blind person lacks sight. What’s surprising about this is that I didn’t even know it for the first half of my life.
</p>
<p>Each night I would tell my mom, “Dinner smells great!” I teased my sister about her stinky feet. I held my nose when I ate Brussels sprouts. In gardens, I bent down and took a whiff of the roses. I yelled “gross” when someone farted. I never thought twice about any of it for fourteen years.
</p>
<p>Then, in freshman English class, I had an assignment to write about the Garden of Eden using details from all five senses. Working on this one night, I sat in my room imagining a peach. I watched the juice ooze out as I squeezed at the soft fuzz. I felt the wet, sappy liquid drip from my fingers down onto my palm. As the mushy heart of the fruit compressed, I could hear it squishing, and when I took that first bite I could taste the little bit of tartness that followed the incredible sweet sensation flooding my mouth.
</p>
<p>But I had to write about smell, too, and I was stopped dead by the question of what a peach smelled like. Good. That was all I could come up with. I tried to think of other things. Garbage smelled bad. Perfume smelled good. Popcorn good. Poop bad. But how so? What was the difference? What were the nuances? In just a few minutes’ reflection I realized that, despite years of believing the contrary, I never had and never would smell a peach.
</p>
<p>All my behavior to that point indicated that I had smell. No one suspected I didn’t. For years I simply hadn’t known what it was that was supposed to be there. I just thought the way it was for me was how it was for everyone. It took the right stimulus before I finally discovered the gap.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So I guess you can just <em>not be able to smell</em> and not know it.
</p>
<p>This makes me wonder what universal human experiences I and my friends are missing out on without realizing it.
</p>
<p>I know one friend’s answer. He discovered he was color-blind sometime in his teens. This still surprises me. People are always taking Ishihara tests (those colorful dotted circles with numbers inside of them) and discovering they’re color blind. Going through life with everyone else saying “The light was red, but now it’s green” and thinking it was weird that they were making such a big deal about subtle variations in shades of brownish-gray, but it was probably one of those metaphors.
</p>
<p>As for me? I took a surprisingly long time to realize I was asexual. When I was a virgin, I figured sex was one of those things that seemed gross before you did it, and then you realized how great it was. Afterwards, I figured it was something that didn’t get good until you were skilled at it and had been in a relationship long enough to truly appreciate the other person. In retrospect, pretty much every aspect of male sexual culture is a counterargument to that theory, but I guess it’s just really hard for my brain to generate “you are a mental mutant” as a hypothesis.
</p>
<p>But even bigger than that, I think I might not have had emotions, at least not fully, for about five years as a teenager when I was on SSRIs. I even sort of noticed myself not having emotions, but dismissed that as an odd thing to happen and probably other people were just being really overexuberant about things. Later I learned emotional blunting is a commonly reported side effect of SSRIs and I was probably just really not experiencing emotions. When I came off them it took me several years to get used to having normal-intensity feelings again, but it wasn’t a sudden revelation, like “Wow, I was missing a fundamental human experience for the past several years!” Just a sense of things being different which was hard to cash out.
</p>
<p>As always, I wonder if a lot of what other people interpret through vague social things might be biological, or at least more <em>complicatedly</em> social. I can’t enjoy jazz music even a little – the best I can do is pick up something sort of like a beat and half-heartedly feel like maybe I could snap my fingers to it if I could build up the energy. My brother fell in love with jazz as soon as he heard it and is now a professional jazz musician who has dedicated his life to it. Are we listening to the same thing when we hear a jazz tune? Or am I like a guy who can’t smell trying to appreciate perfume?

	  <p>Introduction</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/photography/T/w/Two-Surfers-On-The-Beach/Two-Surfers-On-The-Beach-Ireland.html"><img alt="Two surfers on the beach" title="Two surfers on the beach" src="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/photography/photos/T/w/Two-Surfers-On-The-Beach-225x150.jpg" width="225" height="150"></a></p><p>
            This documentation presents the UNIX kernel I wrote
            in 1994-1995.  It's an almost complete implementation of the
            POSIX.1 standard (IEEE Std 1003.1-1988).  My main motivation
            was learning about operating systems design and
            architecture, kernel algorithms, resource allocation,
            process scheduling, memory management policies, etc.  The
            result is a new POSIX compliant UNIX kernel with many
            features real operating systems have: virtual memory, demand
            paging, protection, swapping, etc.  It is not perfect, it
            probably has bugs, but in time they will get fixed and the
            kernel will become more stable.  Since many high-quality
            free software packages are available on the Internet, coming
            especially from the GNU project, I have ported many of them
	    to my system, with the idea of getting real functionality.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  As of December 2007, Thix has been taken over by 
	  <a href="mailto:paulhulme@thix.eu">Paul Hulme</a>.  His work
       	  will be distributed through <a href="http://thix.eu/">thix.eu</a>.
          </p>

          <p>Status</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/photography/B/a/Batroun-Village-Club-Amphitheatre/Batroun-Village-Club-Amphitheatre-Lebanon.html"><img alt="Batroun Village Club Amphitheatre" title="Batroun Village Club Amphitheatre" src="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/photography/photos/B/a/Batroun-Village-Club-Amphitheatre-225x150.jpg" width="225" height="150"></a></p><p>
            The Thix Operating System is fully functional at this time.
            Many free software packages have been succesfully
            compiled/run under it, including development tools such as
            the GNU C/C++ Compiler suite.  However, there is no
            networking support and the only drivers available are for
            floppy disks, (E)IDE hard disks, printers, virtual
            terminals, mem, kmem and null.
          </p>
          <p>
            The format of the executable is still a.out which is very
            hard to maintain due to its so many variants.  Maybe I'll
            switch to ELF one day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thix has been developped under Linux with GCC.  Many thanks
            to all the people that made this possible.

          </p>
          <p>
            December 2006, i.e. 10 years later...  Yeah, it's been
            <em>that</em> long since I touched this stuff.  I could
            never get Thix to work in VMware, not straight out of the
            box anyway, but now that I got a Mac and <a href="http://parallels.com/" rel="external-parallels" title="Parallels">Parallels</a> seems to handle it quite
            well (minor keyboard issues notwithstanding), I figured I'd
            put an image out there for people to play with.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have created 3 images that can be useful for a number of
            things (development, study, or plain curiosity).  The first
            one is a <a href="http://vmware.com/" rel="external-vmware" title="VMware">VMware</a> image with an old distribution of
            S.u.S.E Linux (circa 1996).  This distribution has the old
            versions of GCC and binutils required to compile Thix.  I've
            set up two accounts, <em>root</em> and <em>tudor</em>, both
            using the account name as the password.  The <em>tudor</em>
            account contains the sources for the kernel and all the tools
            that have been ported to Thix.  I tried getting the same Linux
            version to install in Parallels under Mac OS X (Tiger) as well
            as convert the VMware image to Parallels once installed, and
	    failed miserably in both cases, so for now development is under
	    VMware and testing under Parallels.
          </p>
          <p>
            The more exciting part though are the other two images, one
            which is a full installation of Thix complete with a rescue
            floppy disk.  These are raw images (the disk one corresponds
            to an IDE disk with C/H/S=163/16/63 geometry).  Unfortunately,
            I couldn't get Thix to work in VMware, so these images, as you
            can tell from the file extensions, are for Parallels.
          </p>

          <p>
            ... now back to the old stuff.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thix is distributed under the GNU Public Licence.  You can
            download the <a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/thix/download/src/thix-0.3.7.tar.gz"> Thix
            kernel sources</a> and the <a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/thix/download/src/tfs-0.2.1.tar.gz">sources of the fsck</a>
            utility, a great tool in repairing damaged Thix File
            Systems.  To get an idea of how Thix works, you can download
            the raw compressed image of a 3.5" bootable <a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/thix/download/demo/thix-demo.bin.gz">demo floppy</a>.
            Uncompress it with gunzip, dump it on a formatted 3.5"
            floppy and boot from it.  At the login prompt type
            <em>root</em> to enter as superuser or <em>guest</em> to log
            in as an ordinary user.  The <em>root</em> password is
            <em>root</em> and the <em>guest</em> password is
            <em>guest</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are curious and want to install the entire Thix
            distribution (including the GNU C compiler and the related
            utilities), just download the sources (you will need them
            anyway), and read the installation instructions in the
            INSTALL file.
          </p>
          <p>
            Basically, you will have to download the <a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/thix/download/dist/thix-install.bin.gz"> install floppy</a>
            and the packages in the distribution:

<p>One of the central challenges in data science (DS) and machine learning (ML) is
managing and maintaining data quality. As an ML engineer and  practitioner who
frequently constructs, cleans, explores, and models proprietary (i.e. non-benchmark)
datasets, "bad data" makes all the difference between accurate versus misleading
data visualizations, statistical inferences, and models. In this article I want
to hone in on three problems that are fairly unique to DS/ML practice when it comes to
dealing with tabular data in the Python ecosystem using <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a>,
which is one of the de facto tools for data manipulation in the DS/ML toolchain.</p>

</div>

<div>
<h3 id="Data-Integrity-Errors-Fail-Silently">Data Integrity Errors Fail Silently<a href="#Data-Integrity-Errors-Fail-Silently"> </a></h3>
</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>Tooling for type safety is improving in the Python ecosystem with the broad adoption
of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html">typing</a> module and
projects like <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a>, which eases the developer
experience for writing readable, reliable code.</p>
<p>However, for most DS/ML work, this isn't quite sufficient. This is because
logical data types don't always capture the statistical distributions of the
variables under study, which is a key thing to do when, for example, your data
distribution shifts as a result of a world-wide pandemic,
<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/11/1001563/covid-pandemic-broken-ai-machine-learning-amazon-retail-fraud-humans-in-the-loop/">causing ML models to break</a>
in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Having systems in place that fail early (and loudly 🔊) when the data distribution
is not what you assumed is one of the critical pieces to building reliable
production systems, and we need better tooling for this.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>Another important tool in the developer's arsenal is testing. There are many
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1617296279">books</a>, <a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests">articles</a>, and
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5357601/whats-the-difference-between-unit-tests-and-integration-tests">discussions</a>
available online about different types of testing techniques and how to put them
into practice. I won't dive deeply into it here, but in short, testing your code
makes it easier to change it and know when you've broken something while at the same time serving as
documentation.</p>
<p>Even in exploratory or research contexts, it's a good idea to write tests for your
code because it strengthens your confidence in the robustness of the insights that
you're taking away from your analysis.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>The challenge with testing software compounds when processing data for the
purpose of statistical analysis and modeling.</p>
<p>Consider a machine learning pipeline that creates a predictive model from
survey responses. The barriers to testing data and transformation code
tends to be much higher than the business logic that processes survey responses
and stores raw values in a database because the latter tends to be simpler
and more atomic by design.</p>
<p>By <em>atomic</em> ⚛ I mean that each piece of data that's filled out by respondents
and stored in the database can be tested in isolation without having to
analyze the aggregate statistical patterns across a larger sample of responses.
On the other hand, for my statistical analysis to make sense, the overall
integrity of the statistical distribution 📊 of the responses needs to be taken
into account.</p>

<div>
<h3 id="Technical-Debt:-No-Tests-==-Legacy-Code">Technical Debt: <code>No Tests == Legacy Code</code><a href="#Technical-Debt:-No-Tests-==-Legacy-Code"> </a></h3>
</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>Because the effort that goes into exploring, cleaning, and figuring out how to
test my dataset is so high, I'm discouraged from writing tests for my pipeline
code. As the famous software development quip goes:</p>
<blockquote><p>"legacy code is code without tests"</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael C. Feathers, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Robert-Martin/dp/0131177052">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>But you might think: "but when I put my code in production, surely I
– or one of my collaborators – will write tests then?". The thing is,
regardless of who writes those tests or when they're written, someone'll have to
do it at some point, so the sooner and more quickly you can climb
the technical debt mountain 🏔 the better!</p>
<p>In the rest of this post I'll try to convince you that statistical typing gives
us the tools we need to do just that.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>If you've used strong, statically-typed languages before, or the <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a>
static type checker with type-hinting in Python, you may have noticed that type definitions can
often catch nasty type-related bugs 🐞 that render certain kinds of unit tests unnecessary. Other
tools, like <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/">pydantic</a>, enforce types at runtime via a
data parsing model.</p>

Statistical data types builds on top of logical data types, and in fact there's considerable overlap between the two.</p>
<p>For example, the <em>binary</em> logical data type is also a statistical data type. The key
difference is that statistical data types hold additional semantics that govern the kinds
of statistical operations that we can perform on variables of a particular type and
probability distributions that describe those variables.</p>

<div>
<p>What if you can specify the set of acceptable values that a variable can take,
from the data type, set/range of values, or even what distribution a particular
variable is drawn from? This is the goal of statistical typing: to enumerate a
practical set of constraints that specify what should be considered valid data for
a particular dataset.</p>
<p>For example, we might want a <em>categorical</em> variable to be drawn <em>somewhat</em> uniformly
from a set of values <code>{A, B, C}</code>. We can express this as a hypothesis test that
causes our pipeline to fail if any one of the values occurs significantly more
frequently than the others, given a pre-defined level of statistical significance.</p>
<p>Or we may want a <em>real-valued</em> variable to be drawn roughly from a normal
distribution with mean <code>µ</code> and variance <code>σ</code>, which can also be specified with an
alpha value that we deem acceptable for a particular analysis.</p>
<p>In essence, a statistical typing implementation involves specifying three kinds
of metadata for a given set of variables:</p>
<ol>
<li>logical data types, e.g. <code>int</code>, <code>str</code>, <code>float</code>, etc.</li>
<li>deterministic properties, e.g. <code>categorical</code> values and <code>real-valued</code> ranges</li>
<li>probabilistic properties, e.g. sufficient statistics like <code>mean</code> and <code>standard deviation</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The challenge presented by item <em>3</em> is obvious: discovering the underlying
probability distributions of real-world data is often non-trivial. However,
even if we can only express or automatically infer these metadata up to point
<em>2</em>, we can still get something quite powerful 💪: <strong>property-based testing of statistical
analysis code</strong>.</p>

<p>With a statistically-typed dataframe, not only can we validate real-world data to
ensure that our assumptions about them hold up, but we can also test our data
transformation, analysis, and modeling code <em>given valid samples</em> according to
our schema definition. Statistical typing effectively gives DS/ML practitioners
the tools to easily isolate their code from real-world data, providing a convenient
way of implementing unit tests.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>Let me illustrate how these concepts would work in practice with a toy problem using
<a href="https://github.com/pandera-dev/pandera">pandera</a>, a runtime data validation library
for <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas dataframes</a> that I've been developing over
the last few years.</p>
<p>Suppose you're building a predictive model of house prices given features about
different houses:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>In the raw data above you can see that we have the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>feature 1: <code>square_footage</code></li>
<li>feature 2: <code>n_bedrooms</code></li>
<li>feature 3: <code>property_type</code></li>
<li>target: <code>price</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Our modeling pipeline will involve two steps:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h3 id="Defining-Schemas-with-pandera">Defining Schemas with <code>pandera</code><a href="#Defining-Schemas-with-pandera"> </a></h3>
</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>At its core, <code>pandera</code> provides a flexible and expressive API for defining
dataframe schemas and seamlessly integrating data validation logic into your
data analysis pipelines, all while separating the concerns of data cleaning
and validation.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>In the code above, we can see that we're defining a <code>BaseSchema</code>, which shares
columns that are common between the raw and processed data. We're also making
sure that the columns are coerced to the expected data types during validation.</p>
<p><code>RawData</code> and <code>ProcessedData</code> inherit from <code>BaseSchema</code>, and just by looking
at them we can see the difference that we expect between the raw and processed data:
our <code>process_data</code> function should convert the <code>property_type</code> categorical
variable into a set of dummy variables.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h3 id="Runtime-Data-Testing">Runtime Data Testing<a href="#Runtime-Data-Testing"> </a></h3><p>Now we use python's type-hinting syntax to annotate the <code>process_data</code> and
<code>train_model</code> functions, decorating them with <code>@pa.check_types</code> to make sure
that the inputs and outputs are validated at runtime:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Now every time we run our pipeline our data is validated as it passes through
the various transformations:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>So if we pass invalid data into <code>run_pipeline</code>, we should get an error:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Here, <code>pandera</code> tells exactly what went wrong: the <code>property_type</code>
column has an invalid category <code>unknown</code> at the 0th entry.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h3 id="Property-based-Testing">Property-based Testing<a href="#Property-based-Testing"> </a></h3><p>But wait, there's more! Since we've already defined our schemas, we can isolate
the processing and model-training code from real-world data to test that
each component in your pipeline is functioning as expected.</p>
<p><code>pandera</code> builds on top of the <a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/">hypothesis</a>
package to generate synthetic data from search strategies that try to find
the simplest case that would falsify your tests:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>We could run this as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html">unittest</a>
or <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/">pytest</a> suite, but for now we can just run the
tests manually like so:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>So if we were to incorrectly implement any of the components in our pipeline,
we'd see errors early on. In this case, we're just going to return the raw data
without the dummified <code>property_type</code> variable.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Here, our test suite catches the fact that <code>property_type_condo</code> doesn't exist
in our processed data output.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>We can get some more intuition about what's going on with the data synthesis
strategies by interactively generating data using the <code>example</code> method.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Under the hood, <code>pandera</code> is collecting all of the schema properties and
converting it into a search strategy using the
<a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/numpy.html#pandas">pandas-supported hypothesis strategies</a>.
Currently, one limitation that you can see from the <code>ProcessedData</code> example above is that the
generated data doesn't quite capture the joint distribution between the <code>property_type_*</code> dummy
variables, as the second row contains <code>1</code>s for all of the property types. Depending on</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="articleBody"><p dir="ltr"> workers with a universal basic income did not reduce the amount of effort they put into their work, according to an experiment conducted by Spanish economists, a sign that the policy initiative could help mitigate inequalities and debunking a common criticism of the proposal.</p><p dir="ltr">Examining a universal basic income worth about one-fifth of workers' median wages, the researchers also found that the threat of being replaced by robots did not impact workersâ€™ productivity, nor did a tax on firms when they replace a worker with a robot or automated process, though the latter successfully created a disincentive for managers.</p><p dir="ltr">Their <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00676-8">research</a>, published last month in <em>Humanities and Social Sciences Communications</em>, utilized a behavioral economics lab set up by FundaciÃ³n COTEC, a nonprofit organization honorarily led by the king of Spain that promotes innovation as a driver of economic and social development. The foundation aimed to understand how automation and universal basic income may impact entrepreneurs, companies and the public sector.</p><p dir="ltr">Researchers recruited 900 individuals to take part in the experiment, 59% of whom were female and 98% of whom were university students. The average age was 21, with a minimum age of 19 and a maximum age of 30. Participants were asked to work on a set of tasks and were paid based on their performance. Researchers then introduced several different scenarios, such as replacing certain participants with robots and creating a universal basic income worth about one-fifth of the workersâ€™ median pay, to see how worker productivity was impacted.</p><p dir="ltr">Though it was a laboratory experiment, Angel SÃ¡nchez, a co-author of the research and professor at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, said the researchers wanted to ensure their findings would be applicable in real-world situations, so the money given to participants had to be earned.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œItâ€™s not like I just give you money and then you donâ€™t feel you should care much about what to do with it,â€� SÃ¡nchez said. â€œNo â€” you earned it and youâ€™re going to feel itâ€™s yours and you donâ€™t want to throw it away. And thatâ€™s key in the experiment because thatâ€™s what we think gives external validity to the experiment.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">The researchers also vetted their experiment with the FundaciÃ³n COTEC board of trustees, many of whom are part of Spainâ€™s largest companies, â€œand they think this experiment made perfect sense, of course as a stylization of real life,â€� SÃ¡nchez said.</p><p dir="ltr">Though most of the experiment participants were university students, SÃ¡nchez said this, too, adds to the robustness of their methods â€” 40.9% of people under 25 in Spain are unemployed, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the highest youth unemployment rate for OECD companies.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œSo we thought that they would be, for this particular problem, a very good audience because this is something that touches upon what they are going through now,â€� SÃ¡nchez said. â€œSo in that respect, Iâ€™m more confident.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">He added, though, that the results of the experiment are likely applicable outside Spain. Finland, for example, experimented in 2017 and 2018 with a universal basic income and <a href="https://www.kela.fi/web/en/news-archive/-/asset_publisher/lN08GY2nIrZo/content/results-of-the-basic-income-experiment-small-employment-effects-better-perceived-economic-security-and-mental-wellbeing">found</a> that it improved individualsâ€™ mental and economic well-being, though the employment effects were small, which SÃ¡nchez said disproves the common argument that a universal basic income would cause fewer people to work.</p><p dir="ltr">The Spanish government, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52707551">begun</a> its own nationwide experiment with a monthly basic income, providing approximately $500 to each adult in the program. Spain is prioritizing families, including single-parent households, and hopes to reach 1 million homes with the initiative.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, SÃ¡nchez said he hopes to see more research done on robots and automation, especially around how a tax on substituting a human with a robot might impact the economy.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œItâ€™s probably something governments could try at least on a smaller scale for some sectors and see what happens,â€� he said. â€œBecause this is something that, outside of this experiment, I havenâ€™t seen.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">Though a worker-replacement tax could help pay for a universal basic income, SÃ¡nchez and his colleagues also wrote in their research that an automation tax might impede technical change, which could pose long-term problems for society.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œSo other theoretical studies would be useful, too, in whatâ€™s the way to either prevent workers from being substituted by machines or to get money from the guys that are now using machines to compensate the workers that are laid off,â€� SÃ¡nchez said. â€œThese two schemes need a lot of research. Thereâ€™s very little done there.â€�</p><p dir="ltr"><em>The study â€œRobots, labor markets, and universal basic income,â€� published Dec. 16, 2020, in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, was authored by Antonio Cabrales, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; PenÃ©lope HernÃ¡ndez, Universitat de ValÃ¨ncia; and Angel SÃ¡nchez, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> It is a mystery often mentioned in the foundations of mathematics that our best and strongest mathematical theories seem to be linearly ordered and indeed well-ordered by consistency strength. Given any two of the familiar large cardinal hypotheses, for example, generally one of them proves the consistency of the other. Why should this be? The phenomenon is seen as significant for the philosophy of mathematics, perhaps pointing us toward the ultimately correct mathematical theories. And yet, we know as a purely formal matter that the hierarchy of consistency strength is not well-ordered. It is ill-founded, densely ordered, and nonlinear. The statements usually used to illustrate these features are often dismissed as unnatural or as Gödelian trickery. In this talk, I aim to overcome that criticism—as well as I am able to—by presenting a variety of natural hypotheses that reveal ill-foundedness in consistency strength, density in the hierarchy of consistency strength, and incomparability in consistency strength. </p>



<p>The talk should be generally accessible to university logic students, requiring little beyond familiarity with the incompleteness theorem and some elementary ideas from computability theory.</p>
