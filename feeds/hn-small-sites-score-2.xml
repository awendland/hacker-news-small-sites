<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Something I learned recently and I thought was <em>amazing</em> - you can create sockets straight from your shell! Well, assuming you use bash or zsh - from some surface level digging, I couldnâ€™t find anything for fish.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s how it works:</p>

<h2 id="bash">bash</h2>
<p>Bash supports tcp and udp connections out of the box, and does so with an imaginary device in <code>/dev</code>. Enter</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"text!"</span> <span>&gt;</span> /dev/<span>$PROTO</span>/<span>$HOST</span>/<span>$PORT</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And youâ€™ll create a connection to <code>HOST:PORT</code>. <code>$PROTO</code> can be <code>tcp</code> or <code>udp</code>. If the connection canâ€™t be made, writing to/reading the file will fail.</p>

<p>Along with being easy to access from the terminal, itâ€™s <em>very</em> handy for scripts, especially if you donâ€™t have <code>nc</code>/<code>telnet</code>. For example, if a local build of a web app runs on port 8000, you can check if itâ€™s running with:<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>if </span><span>exec </span>3&gt;/dev/tcp/localhost/8000 <span>;</span> <span>then
	</span><span>echo</span> <span>"server up!"</span>
<span>else
	</span><span>echo</span> <span>"server down."</span>
<span>fi</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And then use that information somewhere else.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re unfamiliar, <code>exec</code> without any arguments is used to redirect file descriptors and files. By associating fd 3 with <code>/dev/tcp/localhost/4000</code>, it attempts to create a file there and thus a connection. We use <code>&gt;</code> to open the socket for writing, although we donâ€™t need to write anything in this case.</p>

<p>By using <code>&lt;&gt;</code> we can open a file for reading and writing, and use it to create a super simple curl:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>exec </span>3&lt;<span>&gt;</span>/dev/tcp/<span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>/80
<span>echo</span> <span>-e</span> <span>"GET / HTTP/1.1</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span> <span>&gt;</span>&amp;3
<span>cat</span> &lt;&amp;3
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code>$ ./simplecurl www.google.com
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 03 Dec 2020 00:57:30 GMT
Expires: -1
....
&lt;google website&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Iâ€™m sure you can see the power of being able to open sockets with bash alone. Go play around with it!</p>

<h2 id="zsh">zsh</h2>
<p>zsh has an external module you can load in order to use itâ€™s socket capabilities. It doesnâ€™t support udp like bash, but itâ€™s more powerful in a few ways!</p>

<p>To load the module, put the following in your <code>.zshrc</code> or run it in your shell:</p>


<p>We now have access to the zsh networking builtin - <code>ztcp</code>!</p>

<p><code>ztcp</code> allows creating connections, like bash, but also allows listening for connections.</p>

<p>Straight from the zsh docs, we can create a connection between two machines with <code>ztcp</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># host machine:</span>
ztcp <span>-l</span> 7128
<span>lfd</span><span>=</span><span>$REPLY</span>
ztcp <span>-a</span> <span>$lfd</span>
<span>talkfd</span><span>=</span><span>$REPLY</span>

<span># client machine</span>
ztcp HOST 7128
<span>talkfd</span><span>=</span><span>$REPLY</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>$REPLY</code> variable here is a file descriptor returned by the last <code>ztcp</code> command, referring to the socket/connection it just created.</p>

<p>So, <code>talkfd</code> on both machines is a file descriptor for talking to the other:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># host machine</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>-e</span> <span>"hello!"</span> <span>&gt;</span>&amp;<span>$talkfd</span>

<span># client machine</span>
<span>read</span> <span>-r</span> line &lt;&amp;<span>$talkfd</span><span>;</span> print <span>-r</span> - <span>$line</span>
<span>&gt;</span> hello!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Again, thereâ€™s a lot more you can do, especially with the ability to listen for connections.</p>

<p>Hope this was as interesting to you as it was to me!</p>

<p><strong>Status: 00:27 in the morning of December 4 my account was restored again.</strong> No words or explanations on how it happened – yet.</p>



<p>This morning (December 3rd, 2020) I woke up to find myself logged out from my Twitter account on the devices where I was previously logged in. Due to “suspicious activity” on my account. I don’t know the exact time this happened. I checked my phone at around 07:30 and then it has obviously already happened. So at time time over night.</p>



<p>Trying to log back in, I get prompted saying I need to update my password first. Trying that, it wants to send a confirmation email to an email address that isn’t mine! Someone has managed to modify the email address associated with my account.</p>



<p>It has only been two weeks since someone <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/16/i-lost-my-twitter-account/" data-type="post" data-id="15196">hijacked my account</a> the last time and abused it for scams. When I got the account back, I made very sure I both set a good, long, password and activated 2FA on my account. 2FA with auth-app, not SMS.</p>



<p>The last time I wasn’t really sure about how good my account security was. This time I know I did it by the book. And yet this is what happened.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-03-Losenordsaterstallning.png" alt="" width="467" height="328"><figcaption>Excuse the Swedish version, but it wasn’t my choice. Still, it shows the option to send the email confirmation to an email address that isn’t mine and I didn’t set it there.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>Communication</h2>



<p>I was in touch with someone at Twitter security and provided lots of details of my systems , software, IP address etc while they researched their end about what happened. I was totally transparent and gave them all info I had that could shed some light.</p>



<p>I was contacted by a Sr. Director from Twitter (late Dec 4 my time). We have a communication established and I’ve been promised more details and information at some point next week. Stay tuned.</p>



<h2>Was I breached?</h2>



<p>Many people have proposed that the attacker must have come through my local machine to pull this off. If someone did, it has been a very polished job as there is no trace at all of that left anywhere on my machine. Also, to reset my password I would imagine the attacker would need to somehow hijack my twitter session, need the 2FA or trigger a password reset and intercept the email. I don’t receive emails on my machine so the attacker would then have had to (also?) manage to get into my email machine and removed that email – and not too many others because I receive a lot of email and I’ve kept on receiving a lot of email during this period.</p>



<p>I’m not ruling it out. I’m just thinking it seems unlikely.</p>



<p>If the attacker would’ve breached my phone and installed something nefarious on that, it would not have removed any reset emails and it seems like a pretty touch challenge to hijack a “live” session from the Twitter client or get the 2FA code from the authenticator app. Not unthinkable either, just unlikely.</p>



<h2>Most likely?</h2>



<p>As I have no insights into the other end I cannot really say which way I think is the most likely that the perpetrator used for this attack, but I will maintain that I have no traces of a local attack or breach and I know of no malicious browser add-ons or twitter apps on my devices.</p>



<h2>Details</h2>



<p>Firefox version 83.0 on Debian Linux with Tweetdeck in a tab – a long-lived session started over a week ago (ie no recent 2FA codes used), </p>



<p>Browser extensions: Cisco Webex, Facebook container, multi-account containers, HTTPS Everywhere, test pilot and ublock origin.</p>



<p>I only use one “authorized app” with Twitter and that’s Tweetdeck.</p>



<p>On the Android phone, I run an updated Android with an auto-updated Twitter client. That session also started over a week ago. I used <em>Google Authenticator</em> for 2fa.</p>



<p>While this hijack took place I was asleep at home (I don’t know the exact time of it), on my WiFi, so all my most relevant machines would’ve been seen as originating from the same “NATed” IP address. This info was also relayed to Twitter security.</p>



<h2>Restored</h2>



<p>The actual restoration happens like this (and it was the exact same the last time): I just suddenly receive an email on how to reset my password for my account.</p>



<p>The email is a standard one without any specifics for this case. Just a template press the big button and it takes you to the Twitter site where I can set a new password for my account. There is nothing in the mail that indicates a human was involved in sending it. There is no text explaining what happened. Oh, right, the mail also include a bunch of standard security advice like “use a strong password”, “don’t share your password with others” and “activate two factor” etc as if I hadn’t done all that already…</p>



<p>It would be prudent of Twitter to explain how this happened, at least roughly and without revealing sensitive details. If it was my fault somehow, or if I just made it easier because of something in my end, I would really like to know so that I can do better in the future.</p>



<h2>What was done to it?</h2>



<p>No tweets were sent. The name and profile picture remained intact. I’ve not seen any DMs sent or received from while the account was “kidnapped”. Given this, it seems possible that the attacker actually only managed to change the associated account email address.</p>

        <small>2020-12-03</small>
        <p>This has been the most fun I’ve had with JavaScript in some time. A spiritual successor to the <a href="https://underjord.io/live-server-push-without-js.html">stupid solution</a> which allowed both me and my visitors to see the number of concurrent readers. It is also a piece of whimsy I’ve wanted to do for a while to add more magic and life to the site. The animations default to off to preserve CPU but do turn on the magic switch in the top right if you can and want to see the visuals. This is arguably less stupid.</p>
<p>What is it? Well, a live number of my readership for the entire site for one. If you turn on the magic you should also see the rough positions of other readers on the site that are on the same page as a small hovering geometric shape. I call them wisps.</p>
<p>It’s not often that you can see the footfalls of other people on the web unless they write a comment or something. I don’t want to expose my readers to one another in any privacy-sensitive way or in any fashion that requires moderation. This simply gives a rough indication of activity on the site and whether people are reading the same thing as you. And it moves around in fun ways.</p>
<p>Anyway, I enjoy it and I hope you will too. So how is this done? A small backend in Phoenix using Channels (basically just WebSockets), a small amount of Javascript to render new elements and update positions based on the state updates from the backend. The idle hovering of the symbols is CSS Animation and moving from area to area as the reader reads on is done via CSS Transitions.</p>
<p>I was hoping to default to on, but as I’ve found out with my sweet animated gradient lines, CSS aninmation can get CPU intensive. Right now my gradient lines pause after a period of inactivity and only run if there is activity. They hit 12% or so on my CPU which is dumb. A better fix to make them more lightweight is on the way, the idle-handling is a mitigation. So for these I wanted to avoid a big performance hit. They perform okay right now from my tests, they use the cheap-to-animate transforms so there’s nothing too heavy. But also, there’s not a known upper bound on the potential number of wisps active at the same time and if that scales poorly on some browsers I don’t want to default to setting someone’s phone on fire.</p>
<p>The number is available regardless since that doesn’t animate. I think showing this sort of thing is a fair way of both measuring concurrent visitors and sharing that with the visitor. I can see it, you can see it. I’ve also been considering a 90’s web visitor counter that is actually live. Could be fun. Just gotta find the right aesthetic.</p>
<p>I like this way of extending my site. I guess in a JAMStack fashion. The site is static but I can build small interactive parts and back them with minimal backends which for stateful applications Elixir does exceedingly well. If these backends go down the site will still work. All the important stuff is there. The fun stuff degrades to a connection error in the console.</p>
<p>Let me know how you like it, I do get and read responses to my posts and I appreciate when y’all reach out so try that via <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or @ me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a>.

<p><strong>Paid partnership with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://spartez-software.com/">Spartez Software</a></strong></p>



<p>Yep, you read that right. This week I am working with <a href="https://spartez-software.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spartez</a> to review their new <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1223211/whiteboards-for-jira-team-collaboration?hosting=cloud&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Whiteboards for Jira App</a>. And before you get worried – no, I have no intention of letting that change how I do reviews. I’ll go over the general idea of an app and give you some use cases. Then I’ll take a deeper dive into the feature set and end with my usual analysis – including how the App can be improved. And you can always find a way to enhance any App. I should note now, though, that the App is for Jira and Confluence Cloud only. But we’ll get to that in a bit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, the world has had a crash course in working remotely. I had a bit of a head start, with me starting a remote job at the End of September ’19, versus most everyone’s February to March ’20. However, there is one thing that I’ve missed most. Sometimes it’s just easier to get someone into a meeting room with a markerboard and collaborate while drawing out the workflow, feature, automation, or what-have-you. There isn’t a good analog in the virtual space. A slack meeting comes close, but *not* quiet there, and both Zoom and Webex don’t even come close.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Spartez has been thinking the same thing. If you are not familiar with them, they are often known for Apps like Agile Poker and Agile Cards. To me, it seems they are always a go-to pick when you need to bridge the gap between the physical world and the digital one for your Agile practices. I’ve used both of the apps mentioned above before and have rarely had a problem with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, they were facing a similar problem that most of us now face. How do we take some of the same practices we used to do in person together and take that online? One such challenge is Whiteboarding an idea out. And this was what Grzegorz Tańczyk was thinking about as he was preparing for Atlassian’s Codegeist 2020 hackathon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This concept isn’t a new idea, however. There are several similar products already on the market, including Gliffy and Miro. However, the key to this is that it is Jira Cloud Native. This fact means it can import and change your issues already in Jira and create new content on your whiteboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I saw the demo, I couldn’t help but think of all the potential use cases. There were the normal ones for sorting and updating issues. For example, you can set an “Update Issues” area to be a “Rank” Area and sort your issues there, and that new ranking will be updated on the Jira Issues. Or you can set an “Update Issues” Area to update the assignee so that any issues dragged there are assigned to that person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2678" data-permalink="https://thejiraguy.com/image-170/" data-orig-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image.png" data-orig-size="1192,587" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image.png?w=1024" src="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image.png?w=1024 1024w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image.png?w=150 150w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image.png?w=300 300w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image.png?w=768 768w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image.png 1192w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>However, the idea that captured me was the ability to add Images to it. Imagine this – you are on a UI/UX Team. You need some feedback on a new design change you are working on. So you set up a Webex/Zoom, so everyone can talk, and set up a Whiteboard with the new design on it. Then people can comment on various parts of it on the whiteboard – in real-time. And once a comment is settled on, you can directly convert those comments into Jira issues to be worked on.</p>

<p>That’s the thing, though; this lets you collaborate in real-time. During the product demo, I was invited onto the board. So imagine, here I am in the US; meanwhile, the two people giving the demo for Spartez are in Poland. However, on the call, I could see the edits I was making show up on their board in real-time. That fact alone was amazing. And I didn’t even have to sign up to their Jira instance and take up a license!&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, let’s drill down into some features and see what this App can do.</p>







<h2>Collaborate concurrently with all your team members</h2>



<p>I’ve already touched on this – but this is the whole point. An in-person whiteboard is fantastic for collaboration. And this App is one of the closest experiences I’ve seen to that experience. This App allows you and your teammates, stakeholders, or any interested party to get together and work on an idea or task quickly, all while being aware of what is in Jira.</p>



<h2>Easily populate the whiteboard with existing Jira issues or create new ones.</h2>



<p>This concept, I think, is where this App excels against its competitors. To my knowledge, no other integration allows you to inject your Jira issues directly to the board to be a part of the experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Edit, update, rank, or transition Jira issues – individually, in a bulk, or via update zones.</h2>



<p>So, in the “before times,” one thing I liked about using whiteboards is it allowed you to organize information in a 2D space. Jira Agile Boards comes close, but they only allow you to manage along one axis.</p>



<p>Here, you are free to set up 2D “Zones” that affect your Jira issues. This ability means you can have one area of the board for your backlog, where you rank your issues, then another for planned work, where you have different “Buckets” to assign it to users, then a third to represent your Agile board. All of this is managed on the same screen, as intuitively as “drag-and-drop.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="2683" data-permalink="https://thejiraguy.com/image-4-16/" data-orig-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png" data-orig-size="597,587" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=597" src="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=597" alt="" srcset="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png 597w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=150 150w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px"></figure></div>



<p>You can also drag and select a group of issues, edit them in real-time, give you a refined “Bulk Edit” option, or edit issues individually. The team leaned in because this was connected to Jira and really worked to make sure these capabilities were up to snuff, and it shows. Well done!</p>



<h2>Control the access using Jira permissions.</h2>



<p>This. 100% This. I consider permissions to be essential for any app. Yeah, you might want to keep this open and let everyone use it. Or you might not. Or some mix there-in. The fact is, having permissions that can easily be set gives you that control, rather than the App Developer.</p>



<h2>View in real-time what other participants do.</h2>



<p>They do mean real-time. As I said, this point was the one where most of my concerns lay during the demo. However, Spartez was willing to demonstrate it, granting me limited access to their demo board. And there was a slight delay – but that’s only because Physics is a cruel mistress. But honestly, I had to&nbsp;<strong><em>really&nbsp;</em></strong>pay attention to even notice it – most users probably won’t ever see it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Use post-it cards, images, videos, or draw anything.</h2>



<p>Sure, this can be a useful feature. I stated a use case for this above. But this feature can be fun. Yes, the App does support animated gifs. I checked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="2682" data-permalink="https://thejiraguy.com/image-3-16/" data-orig-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-3.png" data-orig-size="365,493" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-3.png?w=222" data-large-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-3.png?w=365" src="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-3.png?w=365" alt="" srcset="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-3.png 365w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-3.png?w=111 111w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-3.png?w=222 222w" sizes="(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px"><figcaption>You’re going to have to trust me that the hamster is dancing…</figcaption></figure></div>







<h2>What this App does Well</h2>



<p>Well, this App does what it sets out to do, which is enable collaboration by allowing users to work on a virtual Whiteboard. However, the ability to manipulate your Jira issues in real-time via the board is where this App shines. It’s intuitive, useful, and fun to use. And it’s not often I can say that in Jira.</p>



<h2>What this App could work on</h2>



<p>Well, the obvious needs to be stated here. Whiteboards for Jira is only available for Jira Cloud right now. I know for some of you out there, this is a deal breaker.  This situation is sufficient to start with, but I too would love to see this on a Jira Server or Data Center instance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another feature I’d love to see is an option to “Snap to grid.” You can always snap things to other nearby objects, but the first object is always free-hand. I’d love to see some way to add an option to snap it to a grid – because, you know, some of us are perfectionists.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Would I recommend this App?</h2>



<p>First, given the current offering, I can only recommend this App if you are on Jira Cloud. I’m hoping that will change soon, but Cloud is the only place you can get it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And honestly, this App is meant to solve a specific problem. Some teams prefer to use a whiteboard; some teams are fine using digital tools and don’t need it. So, if your one of the former teams who, in the “before-times,” would use a whiteboard, I say get it. Your Teams will likely thank you for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Whiteboard for Jira’s Tier Rank</h2>



<p>This one was hard for me. If I go on functionality alone, It’s an easy A. However, the limited availability is an essential factor. I maintain a free tier Jira Cloud system for testing, but it’s not my daily driver. Given the whole package, I need to give it a B+, with upgrade potential to an A down the road.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>If you trace the news in financial services (banking, insurance, etc.), it's hard not to be overly enthusiastic - the terms like <em>'digital disruption'</em>, <em>'fintech innovation'</em>, <em>'banking 3.0'</em>, <em>'blockchain-powered XYZ'</em>, <em>'transformative services'</em> are flying left and right in everyday announcements. Apparently, very conservative, highly regulated, traditional institutions are now in absolute avant-garde of user-focused, technological revolution, making Internet-era behemoths like Google, Microsoft, Amazon or Facebook pale in comparison.</p><p>Or maybe it's <u><strong>utter crap</strong></u>?</p><p>Cheap PR? Buzzword bingo? Painting the dead grass green? A modern equivalent of H.C.Andersen's <em>"The Emperor's New Clothes"</em>? Hmm, what could be the easiest way to verify that?</p><p>How about performing a ... <strong>time travel</strong>? I mean: going back in time 10-15 years and comparing what banks (or other financial institutions) provided THEN with what they do provide NOW. Because that's what really matters - making a difference from the customer's perspective by providing better customer experience, more valuable products and services, etc. Updating the visual style to look like material design ain't enough.</p><p>Time travel sounds like something beyond our capacity these days, but ... luckily I think can help here. In this particular case, I can really make it happen! How come?</p><p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAVVy_x3Erg">Stay awhile and listen ...</a></em></p><p>In 2001 I've opened a bank account in a completely new bank which was (AFAIK - I'm not 100% sure here) the 1st true Internet bank (no physical branches, just the Internet access - you could do everything on-line, even opening the account) in Poland. It was named <a href="https://inteligo.pl/">Inteligo</a>, and you can read more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inteligo">here</a>. To be honest: those days it was a real game-changer (when compared to traditional banking with money transfers that required you to appear physically in the bank's branch or postal office ...).</p><p>But the very next year (in 2002) <strong>Inteligo</strong> was fully (100%) acquired by the largest bank in Poland - <strong>PKO BP</strong>. That institution was (and is) perceived as a very traditional one - aimed at retirees, elderly people - in general folks who are somewhat distrustful and reluctant to change. What a marriage, wasn't it?</p><p>Fast forward 18 years:</p><ul><li><strong>PKO BP</strong> didn't really "merge" with <strong>Inteligo</strong> at all - it's still a separate service (with a separate brand, pool of financial products, UI, etc.)</li><li>the development of <strong>Inteligo</strong>, which was unquestioningly one of the most innovative banks of its era, has ... pretty much ceased (except few meaningless details I'll cover later) - probably its owner didn't want to invest there and focused on its core e-banking offer (named <a href="https://www.ipko.pl/">'iPKO'</a>) instead; feel free to check the "evolution" of the infosite frontpage in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010601000000*/inteligo.pl">web archive</a>.</li><li>the development of iPKO has progressed steadily (backed up with shitloads of investment) throughout all the past years, bringing the new versions of the web user interface, mobile apps, etc.</li><li>nevertheless, I didn't terminate my <strong>Inteligo</strong> account - I still use it mainly to pay the monthly bills, like a small "sash" just for that purpose</li></ul><figure><img src="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/12/header.png" alt="" srcset="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/header.png 600w, https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/12/header.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Oh, those gradients, so 90-tish :)</figcaption></figure><p>You've probably figured it out already, but I'll state it explicitly - that situation provides me a unique opportunity <u>to compare a banking experience straight from 2002 with the one of the 2020 industry leader</u> (here in Poland). And answer the following questions:</p><ol><li>how much did the banks really progress in the past 18 years?</li><li>what is easier/better/more convenient from the end-user's perspective?</li><li>... or maybe some things have actually worsened?</li><li>did the changes introduced by banks change my behaviors when it comes to finances?</li></ol><p>I can't wait to dive into the details, so let's not delay any longer!</p><p>Let's expand the context on how I do banking, just a bit. My financial behavioral profile looks like that:</p><ul><li>I have both private and company (as an individual entrepreneur) accounts - in a few currencies (usual suspects like EUR or USD, none of the exotics)</li><li>I use both debit and credit cards</li><li>I have used both cash loans and the mortgage in the past</li><li>I've bought car insurance via the bank's partnership once</li><li>I don't use direct debit, its paperwork is freaking cumbersome - I prefer to set subscription-based, regular payments out of the bank</li><li>obviously, I do money transfers, domestic and international</li><li>I've used a few forms of savings, but no investments like stocks or derivatives</li><li>No installment purchases</li><li>I've requested few atypical operations in the past: like early repayments or rebinding mortgage to a different current account - but nothing really fancy</li></ul><p>I don't think I'd call myself a heavy financial instruments user, but probably I'm still above the average. On top of that, I'm a tech-savvy, heavyweight Internet user - I avoid both physical branch visits and call-centers (both phone and video-call versions) at all cost.</p><p>When it comes to banking, I generally prefer browser over mobile apps (exception: Revolut, because they have really good, laser-focused mobile apps). The reason is simple: when I'm browsing my savings or making a transfer, I'd like to have some privacy. In my case, privacy usually means having one of my laptops within a hand reach anyway, so ...</p><p><em>To be continued (next week)</em></p>

<p>Last month saw the passing of Ruth Klüger, one of the most influential memoirists of the Holocaust, at age 88. Born to a Jewish family in Vienna in 1931, Klüger was deported to Theresienstadt with her family shortly before her eleventh birthday then transferred to Auschwitz and a women’s subcamp of Gross-Rosen concentration camp. She survived Auschwitz by lying about her age, after a female clerk told her to say she was 15 when she was only 12 order to be transferred for work in a labor camp. In her memoir, Klüger presents this moment, to which she owed her life, as neither heroic, nor redemptive, but human. “What more do you need for an example of perfect goodness?” (<em>Still Alive</em>,108). Klüger and her mother ultimately survived by escaping from a death march. Her brother and father were murdered. After the war Klüger studied in Regensburg and then in 1947 emigrated with her mother to the United States, where she graduated from Hunter College and went on to earn a Ph.D. in from Berkeley. She became a professor of German literature and taught at a number of universities, including Princeton (where she became the first female full professor of German) and the University of California, Irvine.</p>



<p>At Irvine, Klüger oversaw a study abroad program in Göttingen, Germany, where she was struck by a bicycle in 1989. As she emerged from a days-long coma, she began to recall long-repressed memories and began to write. As <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctttv6p4.9">Michael Rothberg</a> writes, “In her reconstruction of her thoughts as the bicyclist bore down on her, the bicycle and headlight are transformed into barbed wire and a spotlight” (130). Klüger’s memoir, <em>Weiter Leben</em>, published in German in 1992 (“German, strange as this statement may sound, is a Jewish language” (<em>Still Alive</em>, 205)), when she was 70, was a bestseller and won major awards. It can be said to exemplify what Freud called <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0959354314530812"><em>Nachträglichkeit</em>, trauma delayed</a>. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctttv6p4.9">Rothberg</a> praised her memoir for depicting “a site of extreme violence as a borderland of extremity and everydayness” and described it as a model of a literary mode he termed “traumatic realism,” which breaks through deadlock between “realist” versus “antirealist” Holocaust representation (109).The English version, <em>Still Alive</em>,was published in 2001. The book is widely taught in university courses and is used as an eyewitness testimony in major works of Holocaust historiography including Saul Friedländer’s <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/nazi-germany-and-the-jews-saul-friedlander"><em>Nazi Germany and the Jews</em></a>(1997/2007) and Peter Fritzsche’s <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=nIUFQGN2y4EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><em>Life and Death in the Third Reich</em></a>(2008).</p>

<p>Klüger stands out among survivors for her outspoken critical stance toward Holocaust remembrance culture. She <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43555106">once said to the German Studies Association</a>, “the present memorial cult that seeks to inflict certain aspects of history and their presumed lessons on our children, with its favorite mantra, ‘Let us remember, so the same thing doesn’t happen again,’ is unconvincing. To be sure, a remembered massacre may serve as a deterrent, but it may also serve as a model for the next massacre” (GSA, 392). She called out Holocaust tourism, asking what the “carefully tended, unlovely remains” of former concentration camps could possibly communicate of the experience of being imprisoned there (<em>Still Alive</em>, 63). “I don’t go to these concentration camp memorial sites,” she once flatly told <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/holocaust-survivor-ruth-klueger-vienna-reeks-of-anti-semitism-a-435879.html"><em>Der Spiegel</em></a>, and she even asked the Auschwitz Museum to take down her poems, which were displayed there against her wishes (111). “I don’t hail from Auschwitz, I come from Vienna,” she wrote, and it seems that this attitude led her to <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/holocaust-survivor-and-author-ruth-kl%C3%BCger-dies-at-88/a-55188986">opt</a> to have the number tattooed on her arm removed in later life (112). She remained especially critical of German attempts to identify with victims from the Nazi era. “Defeat,” she reflected, “bred its own variants of nationalism”—a kind of <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=eATtDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT416&amp;lpg=PT416&amp;dq=%22negative+exceptionalism%22+rabinbach&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pF_fBLAbO7&amp;sig=ACfU3U39FqK-RnvEvVtrDkPULc064HmiFg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjgmt-RnpztAhXmGVkFHd6mCN0Q6AEwAXoECAEQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22negative%20exceptionalism%22%20rabinbach&amp;f=false">negative exceptionalism</a> about German crimes (163).</p>



<p>Writing in the wake of popular milestones like <em>Holocaust </em>(1978) and <em>Schindler’s List </em>(1993), &nbsp;Klüger echoed critics of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14623529908413937">“the Americanization of the Holocaust”</a> and <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzj0m">“the end of the Holocaust,”</a> for whom brutal historical reality was displaced by redemptive and enjoyable kitsch. The problem of this oxymoronic “Holocaust aesthetics” became apparent to Klüger after a young woman approached her at a book signing and said, with a smile, “<em>I love the Holocaust</em>.” Klüger was taken aback. She understood that the woman loved not the event itself, but reading about it. “But her naïve and undisguised pleasure brought up the question: Should she love to read about the Holocaust? <em>Should</em> we in any shape or form feel positive and empowered or cathartically purged when we contemplate the extinction of a people? My impulse was to say to this woman: You shouldn’t. Stop reading these books, including mine, if you enjoy them” (GSA, 393).</p>



<p>This anecdote, Klüger reflects, validates continued discussion of Theodor Adorno’s famous <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=f1y_dX04yBgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">claim</a> that to write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric, however much one may <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/488568">disagree with it</a>. She worried about <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43555106">Holocaust literature slipping into “kitsch”</a>&nbsp; and reflected about the popularity of Anne Frank’s diary, “it is easier to shed tears over an unfortunate little girl than to agree or disagree with an eminently rational Italian chemist with pronounced opinions that was Primo Levi” (GSA, 400). Telling are the two other survivor authors she praises: the Hungarian Imre Kertész, who reflected on the paradox that once the Holocaust is written about, experience is substituted by the “artefact” of narrative representation, and who was also critical of <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=toS1uAAACAAJ&amp;dq=The+Holocaust+as+Culture+Thomas,+Kert%C3%A9sz,+Imre&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjlsqPEpprtAhUaRTABHVy6AqUQ6AEwAHoECAAQAg">“Holocaust culture.”</a> She also names the Polish writer Tadeusz Borwoski, whose acerbic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Way_for_the_Gas,_Ladies_and_Gentlemen"><em>This Way to the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen</em></a>(1946) she criticizes for its antisemitism and fictional embellishments, while also recognizing “the starkness with which Borowski portrays the slide from indifference to depravity at the edge of human existence and endurance” (GSA, 402).</p>



<p><em>Still Alive </em>is also notable for its “feminist” discussions of <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/668607">nonconsensual sex work</a> in the camps that debunked popular “whorehouse fantasies” and “a thriving cottage industry” of Holocaust-themed pornography (184), while also problematizing Holocaust “photos as an instrument of sublimated voyeurism” (159). But <em>Still Alive</em> stands out most for its <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/T/bo25956860.html">bitter tone</a>. A reviewer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/us/ruth-kluger-dies.html">wrote</a> thatKlüger “unsentimentally redefined the conventional mythos of the heroic Holocaust survivor,” and indeed, she <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/ruth-kluger-author-of-searing-and-celebrated-holocaust-memoir-dies-at-88/2020/10/09/eeee3b16-0a2a-11eb-9be6-cf25fb429f1a_story.html">rejected</a> the idea that suffering united victims as “sentimental rubbish.” Instead she <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/ruth-kluger-author-of-searing-and-celebrated-holocaust-memoir-dies-at-88/2020/10/09/eeee3b16-0a2a-11eb-9be6-cf25fb429f1a_story.html">challenged her readers</a> to “rearrange a lot of furniture in their inner museum of the Holocaust,” <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/holocaust-survivor-ruth-kl%C3%BCger-germany-has-changed/a-19005242">reminding</a> them that “Surviving was not normal. Death was normal.” As the <a href="https://www.wienerzeitung.at/nachrichten/kultur/literatur/2077830-Autorin-Ruth-Klueger-gestorben.html"><em>Wiener Zeitung</em></a> fittingly titled their obituary, Klüger modeled “surviving relentlessly.”</p>



<p>As Klüger’s former colleague <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.5769434/holocaust-survivor-ruth-kluger-would-not-accept-inequality-says-friend-1.5769532">Gail Hart reflects</a>, “I think she was a little bit too hard on those who, say, visited Holocaust memorials and Holocaust museums because she said that, you know, they were trying to admire themselves for hating the Nazis.” In <em>Still Alive </em>(as once <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v37/n03/slavoj-zizek/in-the-grey-zone">quoted by Slavoj Žižek</a>), Klüger recounts a conversation with German graduate students in Göttingen:</p>



<blockquote><p>One reports how in Jerusalem he made the acquaintance of an old Hungarian Jew who was a survivor of Auschwitz, and yet this man cursed the Arabs and held them all in contempt. How can someone who comes from Auschwitz talk like that? the German asks. I get into the act and argue, perhaps more hotly than need be. What did he expect? Auschwitz was no instructional institution…You learned nothing there, and least of all humanity and tolerance. Absolutely nothing good came out of the concentration camps, I hear myself saying, with my voice rising, and [the student] expects catharsis, purgation, the sort of thing you go to the theatre for? They were the most useless, pointless establishments imaginable. That is the one thing to remember about them if you know nothing else. (<em>Still Alive, </em>65)</p></blockquote>



<p>Klüger refuses to cast herself as a saint on account of her experience (unlike the <a href="https://time.com/4392426/ronald-lauder-elie-wiesel-holocaust/">canonized</a> but also <a href="https://www.tikkun.org/a-variety-of-perspectives-on-elie-wiesel">criticized</a> figure of Elie Wiesel). On the contrary, she even recounts a disturbing incident from the postwar years, while she waited in vain for her father and brother to return from the camps, in which she accidentally killed a little dog by forgetting to turn off the gas in the kitchen where he slept. “Of course I was mortified the next morning when I found his lifeless body and was despondent for days. Accident or symptom? And if the latter, symptom of what?” (<em>Still Alive</em>, 158). This fundamental recognition of moral fallibility led fellow Auschwitz survivor Primo Levi to coin the term “the grey zone” to describe how the camps generated <em>amorality</em>, not morality among victims. Yet while Levi similarly characterized Auschwitz as a <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Black_Hole_of_Auschwitz.html?id=VxbSTfGI638C">“Black Hole,”</a> he also, in sharp contrast to Klüger, called it his <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Kf3FAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CAuschwitz+had+been+his+true+university.%E2%80%9D&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi7mdLrkpztAhWhFVkFHVRWCmYQ6AEwAHoECAAQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CAuschwitz%20had%20been%20his%20true%20university.%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false">“true university”</a> for understanding human nature.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2002/11/07/surviving/">Gabriele Annan</a> spoke for many when she called Klüger “merciless” and “outspoken to the point of aggressiveness”: “She also resents all views on the Holocaust that do not tally exactly with her own, and gets indignant about everyone who criticizes her….Levi told a similar story without making one feel so hectored.” <a href="https://www.bundestag.de/en/documents/textarchive/speech-klueger-403862">Speaking</a> before Angela Merkel and the German Bundestag on Holocaust Remembrance Day in 2016, Klüger <a href="https://www.bundestag.de/en/documents/textarchive/speech-klueger-403862">called</a> her own approach “bitter and aggressive,” yet also positively connected her experience with the plight of other groups, praising the “heroic” act of welcoming refugees from war-torn Syria. (She similarly <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.5769434/holocaust-survivor-ruth-kluger-would-not-accept-inequality-says-friend-1.5769532">opposed</a> inhumane treatment of asylum-seekers at the U.S.–Mexico border.) Hart, her former colleague, reflects of Klüger, “She is a very direct interrogator. She doesn’t have any of these conciliatory mechanisms that most women have. And she seeks argument. And at first I found that a little bit off-putting and I kind of avoided her.” As Klüger admitted herself, “Damn right. I <em>am</em> hard to satisfy” (<em>Still Alive</em>, 184).</p>

        <div>
            
<p>I enjoy challenging myself on some weird programming ideas. It's a good way to have fun and to learn new things. This time the challenge was to draw a cheeseburger in CSS using a single empty div.</p>
<p>After a lot of trials and errors, I ended up with this.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>That's probably not the best looking burger ever. However I've been super impressed that it was actually possible to draw something as complex as this with a single div.</p>
<p>In this article we are going to make this cheeseburger, step by step. </p>
<h2>The HTML</h2>
<p>The HTML is very short: a charset, a title, a link to the CSS file, and a single div. </p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Cheesburger&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" /&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class="burger"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>That's it! Now we will focus our attention on the style.css file. </p>
<h2>The CSS</h2>
<p>The most basic CSS for our burger may look like this.</p>
<pre><code>.burger {
  /* Contains all the parts of the burger */
  /* Bun, cheese, meat, lettuce, and sesame seeds */
}</code></pre>
<p>But that's too limited, we won't be able to fit a whole burger inside a single selector. To find more space, we should use the <code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code> pseudo elements. </p>
<pre><code>.burger {
  /* The cheese, meat, and lettuce */
}

.burger:before {
  /* The bun */
}

.burger:after {
  /* The sesame seeds */
}</code></pre>
<p>That might not seem much, but that will be enough for our purpose. </p>
<h2>The bun</h2>
<p>The bun is made of 2 parts: the top bun and the bottom bun. So we have to find a way to draw 2 different shapes in a single CSS selector, which is not that complicated.</p>
<p>We start by drawing 2 rectangles using the <code>border</code> property. </p>
<pre><code>.burger:before {
  content: ""; 
  display: block;

  /* Space between the buns */
  width: 400px;
  height: 55px;

  /* Top bun */
  border-top: 80px solid #f5b230;

  /* Bottom bun */
  border-bottom: 50px solid #f5b230;
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then we use <code>border-radius</code> to curve the bread nicely.</p>
<pre><code>.burger:before {
  /* Same code as previously */
  content: ""; 
  display: block;
  width: 400px;
  height: 55px;
  border-top: 80px solid #f5b230;
  border-bottom: 50px solid #f5b230;

  /* New line */
  border-radius: 30% 30% 20% 20%; 
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/2.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>The ingredients</h2>
<p>Next, we will add the main burger ingredients: cheese, meat, and lettuce. This time it's 3 shapes that we have to fit in a single CSS selector. </p>
<p>Let's focus on the meat for now.</p>
<pre><code>.burger {
  /* Size */
  width: 380px;
  height: 40px;

  /* Color and shape */
  background-color: #681f24;
  border-radius: 15px; 
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/2a.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Well, that's not great. We have some meat, but it's not in the correct position. Unfortunately we can't use <code>margin</code> or <code>padding</code> to fix that, since it would move the whole burger and not just the steak.</p>
<p>Let's try something different: drawing the meat with a <code>box-shadow</code>.</p>
<pre><code>.burger {
  /* Same as previously */
  /* We just removed the background color */
  width: 380px;
  height: 40px;
  border-radius: 15px;

  /* New line */ 
  /* The parameters: margin-left, margin-top, color */
  box-shadow: 10px 85px #681f24; 
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>That works! However we face another issue: how can we  add the cheese and the lettuce in the same CSS selector? To answer that we need to realize 2 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The meat, the cheese, and the lettuce may have the same shape as long as their color is different.</li>
<li>In CSS it's possible to use as many box shadows as we want.</li>
</ul>
<p>So... we simply add more box shadows! </p>
<pre><code>.burger {
  /* Same code as before */
  width: 380px;
  height: 40px;
  border-radius: 15px; 

  /* Updated box shadow */
  box-shadow: 
      10px 50px #fddb28, /* Cheese */
      10px 85px #681f24, /* Meat */
      10px 120px #82af15; /* Lettuce */
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Note that the shadows' order is important, since the first one will have a higher z-index and will appear in front of the others. </p>
<h2>The sesame seeds</h2>
<p>Our burger is taking shape, but it currently looks a lot like a hot dog. We should fix that by adding some sesame seeds to the top bun. </p>
<p>First we draw a single sesame seed with a <code>box-shadow</code>.</p>
<pre><code>.burger:after {
  content: "";
  display: block;

  /* Size and shape */
  width: 10px;
  height: 6px;
  border-radius: 40%;

  /* Position and color */
  box-shadow: 100px -165px #ffffff;
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/5b.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then we duplicate it by using many box shadows.</p>
<pre><code>.burger:after {
  /* Keep same code as before */
  content: "";
  display: block;
  width: 10px;
  height: 6px;
  border-radius: 40%;

  /* Add new box-shadow */
  box-shadow: 
      /* Top row */
      100px -165px #ffffff,
      160px -165px #ffffff,
      230px -165px #ffffff,
      290px -165px #ffffff,

      /* Bottom row */
      60px -135px #ffffff,
      125px -135px #ffffff,
      190px -135px #ffffff,
      255px -135px #ffffff,
      330px -135px #ffffff;
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/5.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Better cheese</h2>
<p>It would be nice if we could make our cheese look more like cheese. For example by showing one of the corners of the cheese slice. This means drawing a new shape (a yellow triangle) even though we already use all our CSS selectors.</p>
<p>If we look carefully at our code, we will notice that there's one thing we haven't really used so far: the <code>content</code> property. Let's see what happens when we add the character <code>▾</code> in it.</p>
<pre><code>.burger:before {
  /* Change the content property */
  content: "▾";

  /* Color and Size of the ▾ */
  color: #fddb28;
  font-size: 120px;

  /* Then keep everything else the same */
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/5c.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We do get a new shape displayed, but it's in the wrong position. And once again we cannot use <code>margin</code> or <code>padding</code> to solve that. </p>
<p>But with some CSS tricks, we will make this work. </p>
<pre><code>.burger:before {
  /* Add 8 spaces before the triangle */
  content: "        ▾";

  /* Actually display the spaces in the "content" */ 
  white-space: pre;

  /* Vertically position the ▾ */
  line-height: 25px;

  /* Then keep everything the same */
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And we finished our cheeseburger!</p>
<h2>Bonus</h2>
<p>When emailing a friend about my challenge, she replied with this clever answer.</p>
<pre><code>.burger:before {
  content: "🍔";
  font-size: 100px;
}</code></pre>
<p>That's a lot less CSS for a better looking result. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I'm really impressed with what I managed to achieve with a single div and some CSS. Of course using SVG would have made more sense, but where's the fun in that?</p>
<p>For your information, the full source code of the cheeseburger is available on <a href="https://github.com/lesscake/cheeseburger-css-div">GitHub</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unlike Django, Flask is not directly tie-up with any database. So we can use Flask with either SQL and No-SQL. And that makes the Flask framework superior among other web frameworks and most suitable for serverless architecture. In this article, I’m going to explain how to code the flask application and database as DynamoDB and deploy to AWS Lambda.</p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>The application architecture will look like this, First I’ve created the file resources.py where I initiate the boto3 client. And I’ve created a models.py file that holds all the class references. And finally, I have the JSON file to create the DynamoDB table automatically from the script.</p><h2 id="table-json">Table JSON</h2><p>You can also create the table directly in the AWS console but my local development
I’m using DynamoDB local instance so I’ve to reply on other technique to create the
the table in my local and one of the methods is using the awscli command.</p><pre><code>{
    "TableName": "User",
    "KeySchema": [{ "AttributeName": "email", "KeyType": "HASH" }],
    "AttributeDefinitions": [{ "AttributeName": "email", "AttributeType": "S" }],
    "ProvisionedThroughput": { "ReadCapacityUnits": 5, "WriteCapacityUnits": 5 }
  }
</code></pre><p>Once you have the JSON file you can run the below command to create the table.</p><pre><code>aws dynamodb create-table --cli-input-json file:////actual_file_path/models/create-user.json --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000
</code></pre><p>You can remove the <code>--endpoint-url</code> if you’re creating the table in AWS console.</p><h2 id="models">Models</h2><p>I’ve created the class reference for each table. One of the benefits of having this Python object is to deal with DynamoDB response in your template and code.</p><p>Also, for authentication purposes, I’ve used the flask login so that you can create authentication with this code.</p><pre><code>from flask_login import UserMixin

class User(UserMixin):
    def __init__(self):
          self.email = None
           self.first_name = None
           self.last_name = None

   def get_id(self):
        return self.VE


    def init_user(self, response):
        self.email = response["email"]["S"]

        if "first_name" in response:
            self.first_name = response["first_name"]["S"]

        return self
</code></pre><h2 id="resources">Resources</h2><p>In order to make the CRUD operation very easy i’ve created the prepare function.
That takes the args, kwargs and turn into the dict. This dict will be useful in
update operation.</p><p>And the get function nothing but make the DynamoDB call and convert into the
class object. And then you can use this class object in your template. Also you can
pass the class object to jinja2 template and use it in the template as you like.</p><pre><code>import boto3

dynamo_client = boto3.client("dynamodb")
dynamodb_resource = boto3.resource("dynamodb")
</code></pre><pre><code>def prepare_user(email, first_name=None, last_name):
    return {"email": email, "first_name": first_name, "last_name": last_name}
</code></pre><p>Main purpose of this prepare user is to create the dict that directly use in CRUD operation.</p><pre><code>def get_user(email):
    response = dynamo_client.get_item(Key={"email": {"S": email}}, TableName="User")

    if "Item" in response:
        return User().init_user(response["Item"])

    return None
</code></pre><p>you can also create the update_user and delete_user function and use it in your code.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>What we have seen is how to incorporate DynamoDB in our flask based project. First the
resources and the creation of the table from JSON file and then have the model class based
python reference and then finally the CRUD operation function.</p></div><p>This article published under

December 2, 2020 | https://carolchen.me/blog/iconic-computer-science-images/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://carolchen.me/blog/iconic-computer-science-images/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="js-article">
    
<p>Over the years I've noticed some images (not diagrams or graphs) that are recognizable to programmers. These images also often have backstories that contain educational information, so here they are! </p>
<h3 id="lena">Lena<a href="#lena" aria-label="Anchor link for: lena"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/lena.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Lena is a Swedish model and this photo of her is from a Playboy cover. Her name is sometimes spelled "Lenna" to encourage her name to be pronounced as "leh-nah" instead of "lee-nah", which is a mildly amusing parallel to classification tasks. The full image has her mostly nude. </p>
<p>The photo was first used six months after release in 1972 because of the mixture of textures and colours for testing an image compression algorithm. This eventually led to JPEGs (first released 1992). It's was standard to use the image to showcase differences between image compression algorithms .</p>
<p>For obvious reasons, having a nude model be the face of all image processing has raised concerns. Still there are blog posts, papers and websites that still use Lena for image processing, though recently it's been about computer vision, style transfer, etc. </p>
<h3 id="the-cornell-box">The Cornell Box<a href="#the-cornell-box" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-cornell-box"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/cornellbox.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Anyone who has taken a graphics course has seen this box as it was first presented at a SIGGRAPH in 1984. It consists of five planes, an overhead light, a rectangular prism and cube. Variations are often seen with spheres of different materials such as dielectrics (glass),  and metals instead of lambertians (the matte texture). </p>
<p>For a raytracer (or pathtracer) this tests a lot of important features. The shadowing of the rectangle onto the wall, contrasting wall colours that should emit some colour onto the white (this is called diffuse reflection). </p>
<p>As shown below, it can also showcase (or rather, suffer from) tone mapping, which is a technique used to map a set of colours to another to make the range look "dynamic" or at least correct. The image below has a bug where the lack of tonemapping causes the image to bug out where it tries to make the colour brighter than a pure white pixel. </p>
<p>Another issue with the image below is the noise, which can be fixed by more sampling in this specific case as it's a monte carlo ray tracer, so it uses some brute force and randomization as computers can't actually simulate light going in infinite directions. </p>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/badtracer.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Other classic rendering images include the Stanford bunny and the Utah teapot. It's been a meme to hide the Utah teapot into random scenes, and the teapot is the graphics version of "Hello World". It appears in Toy Story, the Simpsons, a Windows screensaver, and the Sims. Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIxt9guMbXo">2.5 minute video about the teapot from Tom Scott</a>. </p>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/bunny.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/utahteapost.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="the-big-red-mobile">The Big Red Mobile<a href="#the-big-red-mobile" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-big-red-mobile"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/bigred.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>CLRS! The iconic graphic on the textbook is obviously representative of a tree, but it's actually based on a piece of art. It was made by Alexander Calder in 1959. If you don't already know about mobiles, they're really cool, carefully engineered to work with equilibrium and air currents. Big Red, made from sheet metal and steel weird, can be found at the Whitney Museum of American Art! </p>
<p>Fun fact, Cormen (the C in CLRS) and co wanted to recolour the depiction to use red and black, but the Calder estate would not allow it. You can also purchase <a href="https://www.hangingmobilegallery.com/big-red-mobile/">similar versions of the mobile</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-dragon-book-cover">The Dragon Book Cover<a href="#the-dragon-book-cover" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-dragon-book-cover"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/dragon.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This popular compilers textbook is often referred to as the "Dragon Book" because of the 🐉.The Dragon's shirt says "Complexity of Compiler Design", the shield says "Syntax Directed Translation" and the sword says "LALR Parser Generator". The older edition also has the knight riding a horse labeled "Data Flow Analysis". </p>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/greendragon.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="syntax-directed-translation">Syntax Directed Translation<a href="#syntax-directed-translation" aria-label="Anchor link for: syntax-directed-translation"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The shield describes a method where the compilation is guided by the parser, and describes a more simpler subset of compilers. Syntax directed translation is a method of implementation used on context-free grammars (there's a whole linguistics thing behind this, but it's mostly what it sounds like) as a Type 3 language (on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy#Type-2_grammars">Chomsky Heirarchy</a>) could not be driven by the parser. There aren't too many commonly used languages that would be described as completely context free though there are languages that only have small caveats to become CFGs (not to be confused with control flow graphs, another compilers concept). If you want to read more, this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14589346/is-c-context-free-or-context-sensitive">Stack Overflow question</a> is a good start. </p>
<p>Anywho, this is likely the shield because it prevents any blurring of "execution" and "compilation" by not having any ambiguities embedded in the grammar. </p>
<h4 id="lalr-parser-generator">LALR Parser generator<a href="#lalr-parser-generator" aria-label="Anchor link for: lalr-parser-generator"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>LALR is a type of parser (look ahead left to right) that is simpler than an LR parser (left to right, rightmost derivation) but more powerful than LL parsers (left to right, leftmost derivation). Parser generators greatly improve the pains of writing a parser. GCC started off with a parser generated (it's handwritten as of 2004), CPython makes their own LL* parser generator (*it's a bit variant, CPython devs may correct me), Haskell+OCaml+Ruby are on LALR generators. </p>
<p>Writing a nice parser that works, is fast <em>and</em> surfaces nice syntax errors is a difficult design task, and a bit tedious after designed! Hence the dragon will be slayed by a LALR parser generator (YACC is taught in the book). </p>
<h4 id="data-flow-analysis">Data Flow Analysis<a href="#data-flow-analysis" aria-label="Anchor link for: data-flow-analysis"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Data flow analysis is what it sounds like, tracking the movement of variables or other stored memory through a program. It is represented as the horse the knight is riding probably because it powers most things. I tried to think of why it might be removed from the cover, but there's no obvious answer and everything I came up with just sounded like a conspiracy theory. </p>
<h3 id="o-reilly-animals">O'Reilly Animals<a href="#o-reilly-animals" aria-label="Anchor link for: o-reilly-animals"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/animals.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Iconic meme-able book covers! But who draws them? Who picks the animals when the book is not just called Python? Why are they pictures of animals?</p>
<p>O'Reilly claims that this originated in the weirdness of Unix terms like awk, sed and yacc, and really the rest of it was "it just clicked". Many of them were drawn by one Lorrie LeJeune, and were done with pen and paper! There are also amusing stories of complaints from the arachnephobic who had to deal with spiders on covers. You can find a list of all the books and animals <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/animals.csp">here</a>.</p>
<p>Edie Freedman, the creative director who saw over this claimed that there's meaning to how all the animals that were selected though they aren't revealed. But here are some of the answers. </p>
<h4 id="the-obvious-ones">The Obvious Ones<a href="#the-obvious-ones" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-obvious-ones"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Many (but not all) of the Python books have snakes, Rust has a crab, OCaml has a Camel, GNU has a gnu. </p>
<h4 id="oracle-bugs">Oracle Bugs<a href="#oracle-bugs" aria-label="Anchor link for: oracle-bugs"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>"Oracle Essentials" has a cicada, "Oracle Regular Expressions" have spiders, "Oracle 8i Internal Services" has a bumblebee, dragonfly, dung beetle, lady bug, lantern fly, leaf insect, ants, praying mantis, etc. <em>Very</em> consistently bugs. The speculation is often "oracle software bad" but its likely just a meaningless theme (with each animal having a deep meaning) and not meant to piss off Oracle. It is special as even Python is not consistently snakes, and other groups of books like Google, Regular Expressions, Javascript, etc, do not have any themes. </p>
<h4 id="perl-camel">Perl Camel<a href="#perl-camel" aria-label="Anchor link for: perl-camel"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Here's a weird one, as the obvious choice would be an oyster for the pearl. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB870061922836237000">Wall Street Journal claims</a> that Larry Wall, creator of the language, wanted a camel because like Perl it's ugly but can go a long way without water. Some also claim it's a reference to the proverb "a camel is a horse designed by a committee" and how Perl is easily identifiable as a mixture of other languages. It's cool as the camel as adopted as Perl's mascot after the O'Reilly book. </p>
<h4 id="python-entirely-my-conspiracy">Python (entirely my conspiracy)<a href="#python-entirely-my-conspiracy" aria-label="Anchor link for: python-entirely-my-conspiracy"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Not all of the Python books have snakes! "Data Wrangling with Python" has a lizard, which seems to be a reference to giving Python "legs" to work with data. "Python Programming On Win32" is a crocdile, which to me just screams "PYTHON BUT MAKE IT SCARY". "Learning Python" is a rat and "Python Coobook" is a rabbit, which may be a reference to them being more introductory Python books as they're snake food. </p>
<h3 id="macos-powder-explosion-wallpaper">MacOS Powder Explosion Wallpaper<a href="#macos-powder-explosion-wallpaper" aria-label="Anchor link for: macos-powder-explosion-wallpaper"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>MacOS has always had some iconic wallpapers, especially of California views so this one stood out to me as "this should be generated". This isn't related to programming but I thought I'd investigate it since I've always wanted to know. </p>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/explosion.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Apple explicitly scrubs EXIF data, which is all that microchip tracking metadata that are automatically attached to your images for location, time, device, shutter speeds, etc. The one time the EXIF was leaked on one image it had a bunch of nitpicking notes like "fill in this area close to the edge with more tree so it doesn’t create awkward negative shapes" and "darken some of the stars that are a bit smaller and darker, so there is a little more difference in the starfield" which I guess could be expected for the quality of the Apple wallpapers and the anxiety that comes with being the photographer for a MacOS wallpaper. </p>
<p>Spoiler alert, I didn't actually figure out if these were generated or photographed, but I did figure out <em>how</em> one would generate/photograph them, and that they are <em>very</em> probably photographed. Here is the precedence: photographed ethereal Apple productions. </p>

<p>As expected, making these powder explosions would be a pain. One must first have the space, the high speed camera (powder flying through the air like that lasts less than a second) and cover all of the equipment. The powder is typically flour, and mixed with "holi" powder which is just high pigment powder for photoshoots/parties/crafts. It seems that many photographers actually have people in suits to throw the powder and those shots tend to look more like powder clouds than explosions. I found someone who did something a bit more clever, which involves a simple canon mechanism (silicon tubing and a pump) and sound triggered. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Over the last decade there has been some really great software products that
have been shut down with little to no warning. This is getting so common that
someone created a website called <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">Killed by Google</a>.
After Google <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html">shutdown Reader in 2013</a>, I spent months trying to find a replacement.
During this research I determined I should try to find solutions to services
I use everyday that wouldn’t be shut down in some board room over profit
margins.</p><p>About five years ago, I started researching smart home products and services
as well as automation software to use in my next home. I started to notice the
following trends:</p><ul><li>Software products and services being shutdown with no notice</li><li>No software updates for promised features or security fixes</li><li>Software updates that remove out of the box functionality (features/bricking)</li><li>Free software that suddenly requires a paid subscription</li><li>Companies are selling or hording your data.</li></ul><p>For the sake of relevancy let’s just cover what’s happened since the start of
2019.</p><h2 id="2019">2019</h2><h3 id="ecobee">ecobee</h3><p>When ecobee launched the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ecobee-Switch-Smart-Amazon-Built/dp/B0798LCLJ5?tag=niemyjski-20">ecobee Switch+</a>
I became super interested in them due to the shear amount of sensors in a small
device. They had also stated there would be API support as well as it would be
integrated as a remote temperature sensor for an
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/ecobee4-Thermostat-Built-Sensor-Included/dp/B08BZTPMW1?tag=niemyjski-20">ecobee smart thermostat</a>.</p><p>It took most of 2019, before 15 of my ecobee switches got the firmware update
to be added to my thermostat but the delivered promise of api support never came.</p><h3 id="best-buy-insignia-shut-down">Best Buy Insignia shut down</h3><p>Best Buy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/6/20853671/best-buy-connect-insignia-smart-plug-wifi-freezer-mobile-app-shutdown-november-6">quietly announced on <strong>September 6th</strong></a>
that it was shutting down it’s Insignia brand of smart home devices on
<strong>November 6th</strong>. App access would no longer be available rendering most of the
products unusable.</p><blockquote><p>The announcement has already been purged from the Best Buy Insignia website.</p></blockquote><h3 id="lowe-s-iris-shut-down">Lowe’s Iris shut down</h3><p>Lowe’s Iris platform first launched in 2012, offered free and paid subscription
options. An <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/2/18208407/lowes-iris-smart-home-platform-shutting-down-march-2019">announcement on <strong>January 31st</strong></a>
that it was shutting down on <strong>March 31st</strong>, rendering devices dead.</p><p>I’m happy they offered a program to trade in any purchased devices for a
prepaid credit card so users could migrate to a different solution.</p><blockquote><p>The announcement has already been purged from the Lowe’s Iris website.</p></blockquote><h3 id="chamberlain-myq-breaking-api-changes">Chamberlain MyQ Breaking API Changes</h3><p>When it comes to automating garage door openers there are few out of the box
solutions that work and are as popular as the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smart-Garage-Opener-Chamberlain-MYQ-G0301/dp/B075H7Z5L8?tag=niemyjski-20">Chamberlain MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener</a>.</p><p>An open source project created a python library that many other open source
projects use to integrate with MyQ using the MyQ Api. Unfortunately the MyQ
team has broken this <a href="https://github.com/arraylabs/pymyq/issues/27">api multiple times</a>
in 2019 causing automations to break.</p><blockquote><p>I hesitate a little bit every time I see an MyQ app update on my phone. as
I’m always wondering if this will trigger my opener firmware to be updated
and break my home automations.</p></blockquote><p>It’s been a cat and mouse game between smart home developers and the MyQ team.</p><h3 id="stringify-shut-down">Stringify shut down</h3><p>Stringify was launched in 2014 and bought by Comcast in 2017. Fast forward 18
months later to <strong>April 8th</strong>, Stringify <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/410576/stringify-is-shutting-down-after-five-years/">announces via email</a>
it will be shutting down new sign ups immediately and all data will be deleted
on <strong>July 8th</strong>.</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Stringify has announced that it will be shutting down in the upcoming months. <a href="https://t.co/VFshmwCeKK">https://t.co/VFshmwCeKK</a></p>— Stringify (@StringifyIt) <a href="https://twitter.com/StringifyIt/status/1115370840353202177?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 8, 2019</a></blockquote><h3 id="sonos-bricking-devices">Sonos bricking devices</h3><p>In <strong>December</strong> it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21042871/sonos-recycle-mode-trade-up-program-controversy">uncovered</a>
that Sonos was bricking devices upon agreeing to recycle your device or by
upgrading the speaker.</p><blockquote><p>Recycle Mode is a state your device enters 21 days after recycling
confirmation in the Sonos app. In Recycle Mode, all data is erased and the
device is permanently deactivated so you can safely and securely dispose of
it. Once a device is in Recycle Mode, it cannot be reactivated.</p></blockquote><p>This decision was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21166777/sonos-ending-recycle-mode-trade-up-program-sustainability">overturned</a> in <strong>March 2020</strong>.</p><h3 id="works-with-nest-shut-down">Works with Nest shut down</h3><p>Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-nest/helpful-home/">announced</a> on
<strong>May 7th</strong> that it would be shutting down <code>Works with Nest</code> on <strong>August 31st</strong>.
It was only after massive backlash that they <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-nest/updates-works-with-nest/">announced</a>
that they would continue to support integrations until they were available in
the new API’s backed by a single Google Account.</p><p>Current users have to be super careful not to migrate their existing Nest
accounts to the new Google account for fear of losing integrations. I believe
this migration and integration support for various hubs will be completed in
2021.</p><h3 id="wink-product-availability">Wink product availability</h3><p>For over five months users in the Wink ecosystem couldn’t purchase any new
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wink-WNKHUB-2US-Smart-home-White/dp/B01KW8WGZQ?tag=niemyjski-20">Wink devices</a>
due to <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/409925/why-we-cant-recommend-wink-hubs-anymore/">product availability issues</a>.
This lasted from <strong>November 2018</strong> through <strong>March 2019</strong>.</p><h2 id="2020">2020</h2><h3 id="august-connect-firmware">August Connect firmware</h3><p>In early 2020, I received a firmware update that caused all five of my
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0752VPHVK?tag=niemyjski-20">August Smart Lock Pro Connect Hubs</a>
from connecting to my Wi-Fi. Slowly but surely they’ve came online but every
now and then I’ll have one drop offline. Thankfully I have the Z-Wave version
and access the locks that way.</p><h3 id="dark-sky-shut-down">Dark Sky shut down</h3><p>On <strong>March 31st</strong> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201666/apple-acquires-weather-app-dark-sky-shut-down-android-wear-os-ios">Apple acquired Dark Sky</a>
and announced it would be shutting down it’s API at the end of <strong>2021</strong>. A lot
of smart home users used the API to power weather automations.</p><blockquote><p>Apple did the right thing by giving users plenty of time to move off of the API.</p></blockquote><h3 id="ecobee-1">ecobee</h3><p>As stated in the 2019 section, when remote thermostat sensors support was
rolled out to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ecobee-Switch-Smart-Amazon-Built/dp/B0798LCLJ5?tag=niemyjski-20">ecobee Switch+</a>
via an firmware update. A few months later it was removed with a second firmware
update. Now only some of my switches are paired as a remote sensor to my
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/ecobee4-Thermostat-Built-Sensor-Included/dp/B08BZTPMW1?tag=niemyjski-20">ecobee smart thermostats</a>.</p><p>To make matters worse there is an unresolved server side bug that keeps
renaming any switch that has a custom defined name back to the serial number of
the device. This should never happen to a consumer device paired with cloud
outages leaves a lot to be desired from ecobee when it comes to software.
I recommend using ecobee’s HomeKit support to get around these limitations
where possible.</p><h3 id="home-assistant-breaking-changes-and-os-changes">Home Assistant breaking changes and OS changes</h3><p>In <strong>May</strong> the Home Assistant team <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2020/05/26/installation-methods-and-community-guides-wiki/">announced</a>
that they were dropping support for generic linux installs without consulting
the community. This was a major change that left many users frustrated. It makes
sense that users should be using the managed Home Assistant operating system,
but a large portion of users installed it on Ubuntu and other linux operating
systems of which may have been used for other purposes.</p><blockquote><p>As the platform matures there will be less churn and breaking changes.</p></blockquote><p>As we near the 1.0 release of Home Assistant, we’ve seen more integrations
be removed as well as changes to the API surface. Although these are good
changes they still require work by end users. This is to be expected of pre
version 1.0 software.</p><blockquote><p>Although breaking changes do happen from time to time. You control the
updates on your own time, helping to limit breaking changes.</p></blockquote><h3 id="chamberlain-myq-breaking-api-changes-1">Chamberlain MyQ breaking API changes</h3><p>For the second year running the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smart-Garage-Opener-Chamberlain-MYQ-G0301/dp/B075H7Z5L8?tag=niemyjski-20">Chamberlain MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener</a> has had issues due to MyQ trying lock out users
from using the MyQ API. It has been a cat and mouse game between smart home
developers and the MyQ team.</p><h3 id="tuya-firmware-locking">Tuya firmware locking</h3><p>I love <a href="https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/securing-smart-home-devices-with-esphome-and-home-assistant/">flashing retail devices</a>
from the stock firmware to ESPHome. I do this mainly for privacy and to ensure it
can be brought into Home Assistant easily. It appears there is a
<a href="https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert/wiki/Collaboration-document-for-PSK-Identity-02">new firmware</a>
on some Tuya devices that is preventing flashing causing vendor lock in to
unknown third party services. I can’t blame companies for wanting to lock down
the firmware, it just leaves little options for smart home integrations when
the company leaves the space.</p><h3 id="logitech-harmony-express-remote-shut-down">Logitech Harmony Express remote shut down</h3><p>On <strong>July 9th</strong> Logitech <a href="https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360048494053">announced</a>
it was discontinuing the 15 month old smart remote control that cost $250. It
would also be shutting down the Alexa service on <strong>September 30th</strong>, rendering
the device useless to control by it’s main selling feature.</p><blockquote><p>Logitech is offering a free upgrade if you bought this product!</p></blockquote><h3 id="wink-subscription">Wink Subscription</h3><p>On <strong>May 20th</strong> Wink <a href="https://blog.wink.com/wink-blog/2020/5/6/introducing-wink-subscription">announced</a>
that it would start charging all users $4.99 a month. Failure to subscribe
would result in severely limited functionality, pretty much forcing users to
upgrade in order to add or edit devices, add automations, or use voice control.</p><h3 id="ifttt-subscription">IFTTT Subscription</h3><p>On <strong>September 10th</strong> IFTTT <a href="https://ifttt.com/explore/introducing_ifttt_pro">announced</a>
a pro plan that costs $9.99 a month. The existing free plan would be severely
limited to 3 applets.</p><h3 id="smart-things-classic-shut-down">Smart Things Classic shut down</h3><p>On <strong>June 24th</strong> SmartThings <a href="https://community.smartthings.com/t/update-on-smartthings-classic-shutdown/213037">announced</a>
that SmartThings classic will be shutting down on <strong>December 1st</strong> . All users
who haven’t migrated to the new SmartThings API will have major disruptions
(e.g., your integrations will be deleted).</p><h3 id="wemo-cloud-only">Wemo cloud only</h3><p>On <strong>May 26th</strong> Wemo <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/05/26/wemo-is-replacing-its-awful-network-based-smart-home-management-with-online-accounts/">announced</a>
<code>Wemo Accounts</code>, a new way to manage all of your devices with an online account.</p><blockquote><p>The new account system shifts all of the device management away from your
local network and onto cloud services, which should reduce problems with the
Wemo apps and integrations with third-party services. However, account
creation is currently broken, which is very on-brand for Wemo.</p></blockquote><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>It’s worth looking at all the services and products that were shut down and
disappeared like they never even existed. Some of these products and service
had amassed hundreds of thousands of users. Is there an emerging pattern? Would
you ever trust this company again?</p><p>I recommend buying devices that can be controlled locally though ESPHome, mqtt,
Thread, Zigbee or Z-Wave. Stay away from products that use a vendor specific
protocol especially if the company has a history of shutting down services or
products. I’d also avoid large investments in new products by any company
unless they have a positive track record or can be controlled via a standard.</p><blockquote><p>If an online service doesn’t charge you a monthly fee, you are the product.
Products that have a free cloud dependency have to find a way to turn a
profit or they will shut down. Someone has to pay for the cloud services.</p></blockquote><p>I do feel comfortable sticking with HomeKit supported devices as I can control
them locally and Apple has a good track record of privacy, supporting devices,
and part of HomeKit was <a href="https://github.com/apple/HomeKitADK">open sourced</a> too.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The story I am going to share below has so many variations, but the lesson is always the same. This specific version I got from <a href="https://twitter.com/Shadaya_Knight_/status/1327881911214157825">Twitter</a>:</p><p>A father said to his son: "You've graduated with honors, here is a car (Nissan Skyline R34) that I bought years ago, it's old. BUT before I give it to you, take it to the USED CAR STORE &amp; tell them you want to sell it &amp; see how much they offer you. The son went to the USED CAR STORE, returned to his father &amp; said: "They offered me $1000 because it looks very worn out". The father said, "Now take it to the PAWN SHOP"...</p><p>The son went to the PAWN SHOP &amp; returned to his father &amp; said: "The PAWN SHOP offered $100 because it's a very old car". Then the father asked the son to go to a CAR CLUB &amp; show them the car. The son took the car to the CAR CLUB &amp; told his father: "Some people in the club offered as much as $100 000 for it since it's a NISSAN SKYLINE R34, an ICONIC car &amp; sought after by many"...</p><p>Then the father replied: "I wanted to let you know that the right place values you in the right way. Don't find yourself in the wrong place and get angry if you are not valued. Those that know your value are those who appreciate you, don't stay in a place where nobody sees your value. KNOW YOUR WORTH"</p><p>...</p><p>Immediately after graduating from college with a CS degree, I was on the hunt for a developer job. Lucky enough and through some personal connection I was able to land a front-end developer role.</p><p>I was so happy to have gotten that job that I did lowball myself when asked how much do I want to get paid...At that time I was interning and I was being paid $20 an hour...so I said to myself let's just say anything between $22/hr to $25/hr ...Guess what! That's exactly what I got paid. I met the president of the company after an interview, and after reviewing my offer he said...something like... what I said for my offer is around the same salary range people at the company start with ...They sent me an official offer letter just a few days after that...and I was offered $45k a year...You can imagine what was going through my mind...I lowballed myself...Why did I say $22/hr? ...I was happy to get the job but was kinda sad that I didn't capitalize on the opportunity. The reason was mainly that after graduation I was kinda desperate to get a job...I was out of the school dorms, I needed to have my own place, I needed to take care of my own expenses. So I was just ready for anything that would pay me.</p><p>After like 5 months of working in this job I wasn't so happy...I felt as if what I was doing did inspire me enough...That, plus a few other personal reasons led me to quit my job. Where I was interning when I was in college...by the time I was ending my time before my full-time job, the boss had upped my salary to $30/hr. What I was doing to my boss at the internship place was valuable enough for him to increase my salary without even asking and just after 5 months of working for him. This was one of the greatest lessons I learned...that Know Your Worth...There will be places where your skills are valued higher than other places. Find those places and people who value your skills.</p><p>...</p><p>Here is another story I had read a few months ago...it goes like this...There was a marathon in one of the US cities, and two people put their table stands where the runners would pass. One of them had oranges and another one had donuts...Almost all runners passed by the oranges station to grab the oranges and continue their race. Almost none grabbed the donuts. The reason is plain clear...the tired runners wanted some refreshing fluid in their body at the time...you really can't imagine a marathon runner grabbing a donut in the middle of the race, it's just not fitting. A fresh orange was a better offer to the runners. While the donut person had good intentions...he/she wasn't there at the right moment. Actually, at the finish line of the race, most of the runners wished there were some donuts there to greet them...but unfortunately, a donut person was nowhere to be found. So while a donut would be so valuable once the race was over, the oranges pretty much saved the day in the middle of the race. Again, know your value...know where you will be valued.</p><p>Are you a designer in a company that thinks design work is not as important as developing (programming) ...just get out...and find a place where designers are valued. Are you a developer that think they're not as valued as the business side of the company...you have an opportunity to go somewhere where your skills will be valued and you will be compensated accordingly.</p><p>So folks that's the lesson of the day...KNOW THY VALUE</p><blockquote>Everyone is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid</blockquote>

December 2, 2020 | https://www.science4all.org/article/the-triangle-of-power/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.science4all.org/article/the-triangle-of-power/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>The web is full of amazing and surprising creations. One such creation that has caught my attention lately was a video by 3Blue1Brown on the so-called “Triangle of Power”.</p>
<p><iframe width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sULa9Lc4pck" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Apparently, the ideas originated on <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/30046/alternative-notation-for-exponents-logs-and-roots" target="_blank">a Math Stack Exchange thread</a> asking for more unified notations for exponents, logarithms and radicals. Indeed, while these formulas $2^3 = 8$, $\sqrt[3]{8} = 2$ and $\log_2 8 = 3$ are all discussing the same relationship that holds between 2, 3 and 8, they look so different that a student may not witness their commonality.</p>
<p>I see. So, the question is whether there could be a more explicit notations to unify and better visualize this relationship…</p>
<p>Yes indeed. One alternative notation has gained much interest. It is the so-called <strong>Triangle of Power</strong>. In our case, this triangle of power can depict the relationship between 2, 3 and 8 in a wonderfully compact and harmonious way, namely by denoting $_2\overset{3}{\Delta}_8$.</p>
<p>And that triangle $_2\overset{3}{\Delta}_8$ is a formula?</p>
<p>No! It’s more like an identity in itself. To perform computations, it might be useful to move one of the entries of the triangle to the other side of an equal sign as follows:<br>
$$_2\overset{3}{\Delta}_8 \Longleftrightarrow \; _2\overset{3}{\Delta} = 8\Longleftrightarrow \overset{3}{\Delta}_8 = 2\Longleftrightarrow \; _2\Delta_8 = 3.$$</p>
<p>3Blue1Brown argues that this beautiful notation greatly simplifies the understanding of the mathematical underlying objects, namely exponents, logarithms and radicals. This claim is quite disturbing at first. Indeed, again and again, I had to translate the equations of his video into equations in terms of the notations I am more familiar with. I could not think in terms of the triangle of power.</p>
<p>So you think it’s a bad notation…</p>
<p>Actually, no. This just helped realize how dependent on current flawed notations my mathematical thinking was! That’s not good! Moreover, I did get stunned by some of the many artful equations that this new notation yielded, e.g.<br>
$$_x\overset{y}{\Delta}_{_x\overset{y}{\Delta}}, \; _x\overset{_x\Delta_z}{\Delta}_z, \; _{\overset{y}{\Delta}_z}\overset{y}{\Delta}_z, \; \overset{+}{\Delta}_\times, \;  _\times\Delta_\times, \; _\times\overset{\oplus}{\Delta}, \; _x\overset{y}{\Delta} = \overset{1/y}{\Delta}_x, \; _{_x\overset{y}{\Delta}}\overset{z}{\Delta}_{_x\overset{yz}{\Delta}}, \; _x\Delta_y \; _y\Delta_z = \; _x\Delta_z, \; _e\overset{i\tau}{\Delta}_1, \; _e\overset{i\tau/4}{\Delta}_i \ldots $$</p>
<p>By the end of the video, I got hooked.</p>
<p>Even though you couldn’t follow the computations…</p>
<p>That’s true. And it would have been hypocritical of me to claim that they were indeed the way to go, if I had not yet experienced the actual benefaction of using and thinking in terms of this triangle of power. Following 3Blue1Brown’s advice, it seemed that the only way for me to do so is to go explore and play with the triangle of power. So I gave myself homeworks.</p>
<p>What homework?</p>
<p>I’ve decided to redefine and rederive well-known results about exponents, logarithms and radicals. And since I love the web, I couldn’t not share it with you.  Enjoy!</p>
<h2>Defining the Triangle of Power</h2>
<p>Let us start from the bottom. We’ll assume that integers and real numbers have been well-defined, as well as the addition and the multiplication. In this section, we’ll redefine the triangle of power $_x\overset{y}{\Delta}_z$ for all $x,z &gt; 0$ and $y \in \mathbb R$. It won’t be straightforward though. The first step is to define the triangle of power for top integer values of $y$, then for top rational values, and finally we shall use continuity to generalize it for real tops.</p>
<p>OK… Let’s start with integer tops.</p>
<p>Let’s define $_x\overset{n}{\Delta}$ for all $x &gt; 0$ <a href="http://www.science4all.org/article/proof-by-induction/" target="_blank">by induction</a> on $n$. For $n=0$, we define $_x\overset{0}{\Delta}_1$, and we consider the induction $_x\overset{n\pm 1}{\Delta}_{x^{\pm 1} \times \overset{n}{_x\Delta}}$. We indeed use the “+” sign to define induction over positive integers, and the “-” sign for induction over negative integers.</p>
<p>Wait… Are you sure you’ve given an actual inductive definition?</p>
<p>Getting used to the meaning of the compact triangle-of-power notation is likely to be troublesome at first. What we really mean in terms of equations is that we define respectively $_x\overset{0}{\Delta} = 1$ and $_x\overset{n\pm1}{\Delta} = x^{\pm1} \times\; _x\overset{n}{\Delta}$. More generally, we have<br>
$$_x\overset{n}{\Delta}_y \Longleftrightarrow \; _x\overset{n}{\Delta} = y\Longleftrightarrow \overset{n}{\Delta}_y = x\Longleftrightarrow \; _x\Delta_y = n.$$ From this definition, it follows straightforwardly that $_1\overset{n}{\Delta}_1$, $\;_x\overset{m+n}{\Delta} = \;_x\overset{m}{\Delta} \times\, _x\overset{n}{\Delta}$, $\; _x\overset{-n}{\Delta} = \;_{1/x}\overset{n}{\Delta} = \;\left( _x\overset{n}{\Delta} \right)^{-1}$ and that $x \mapsto \;_x\overset{n}{\Delta}$ is strictly increasing for $n \geq 1$ (and thus injective).</p>
<p>I think I follow…</p>
<p>Take your time. These notations can be very troubling.</p>
<p>Sure. You can move on.</p>
<p>Let us now a prove our first beautiful theorem. For $x&gt;0$ and $n,m\in \mathbb Z$, we have $_{_x\overset{m}{\Delta}}\overset{n}{\Delta}_{_x\overset{mn}{\Delta}}$. I cannot help to comment on how cool I think that this elegantly structured notation is a theorem! We prove this by induction on $n$. The case $n=0$ boils down to the definition of the triangle of power for zero top value. Assuming that the result holds for $n$, we now have, using the induction definition of the triangle of power, $_{_x\overset{m}{\Delta}}\overset{n+1}{\Delta} = \;_x\overset{m}{\Delta} \; \times\, _{_x\overset{m}{\Delta}}\overset{n}{\Delta} = \;_x\overset{m}{\Delta} \times\, _x\overset{mn}{\Delta} = \;_x\overset{m(n+1)}{\Delta}$. This equality can be equivalently rewritten as $_{_x\overset{m}{\Delta}}\overset{n+1}{\Delta}_{_x\overset{m(n+1)}{\Delta}}$, which concludes the induction proof.</p>
<p>There is elegance in the notation indeed…</p>
<p>I know! Here’s another beautiful theorem. For all $x,y &gt; 0$ and $m,n \in \mathbb Z$, we have $_x\overset{n}{\Delta}_{y} \Longleftrightarrow \; _x\overset{mn}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{m}{\Delta}}$. Using the previous result, we see that the right-hand side is equivalent to $_{_x\overset{n}{\Delta}}\overset{m}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{m}{\Delta}}$. For the left-to-right implication we can replace the left of the main triangle by $y$, yielding $_y\overset{m}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{m}{\Delta}}$, which is equivalent to $_y\overset{m}{\Delta} = \; _y\overset{m}{\Delta}$, which is clearly true. To go from right to left, we notice that $z = y$ is a solution of $_z\overset{m}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{m}{\Delta}}$. Yet the map $z \mapsto \; _z\overset{m}{\Delta}$ is injective, thus it is the only solution. Thus $_x\overset{n}{\Delta} = y$, which concludes the proof for positive integers $n$. </p>
<p>Cool! And I guess that the case for negative integers $n$ is dealt with similarly.</p>
<p>Yes! The theorem we’ve just proved can now be used to define the triangle power for rational tops. For $p \in \mathbb Z$ and $q \in \mathbb Z^*$, we define $_x\overset{p/q}{\Delta}_{y}$ if $_x\overset{p}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{q}{\Delta}}$. To prove the consistency of this definition, we need to make sure that it holds for any $p’,q’$ instead of $p,q$, whenever $p’/q’ = p/q$. To prove this it suffices to show that $_x\overset{p/q}{\Delta}_{y} \Longleftrightarrow _x\overset{kp/kq}{\Delta}_y$, i.e. $_x\overset{p}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{q}{\Delta}} \Longleftrightarrow \; _x\overset{kp}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{kq}{\Delta}}$. But this boils down to applying the two previous theorems. Indeed, $_x\overset{p}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{q}{\Delta}} \Longleftrightarrow\; _x\overset{kp}{\Delta}_{_{_y\overset{q}{\Delta}}\overset{k}{\Delta}} \Longleftrightarrow \;_x\overset{kp}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{kq}{\Delta}}$.</p>
<p>Cool! Top integers, checked. Top rationals, checked. All we have left to define are top reals!</p>
<p>Yes. But to get there, we’ll need to first prove another beautiful theorem: $_x\overset{p/q}{\Delta}_y \Longleftrightarrow \; _x\overset{p}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{q}{\Delta}} \Longleftrightarrow \; _x\overset{p}{\Delta} = \; _y\overset{q}{\Delta} \Longleftrightarrow \; _y\overset{q}{\Delta}_{_x\overset{p}{\Delta}} \Longleftrightarrow \; _y\overset{q/p}{\Delta}_x$. In other words, by fixing $r = p/q$, we obtain the reflection theorem. For $x,y &gt; 0$ and $r \in \mathbb Q^*$, we have $_x\overset{r}{\Delta}_y \Longleftrightarrow \; _y\overset{1/r}{\Delta}_x$. This is so pretty! Moreover, by continuity, in the next section, we’ll see that this holds for nonzero real tops as well.</p>
<p>Are we now ready to define the triangle of power for top reals?</p>
<p>Almost! We now need to prove that for any $x\geq 1$, we have $_x\overset{1/n}{\Delta} \rightarrow 1$. Notice to start with that $_x\overset{1/n}{\Delta} \geq 1$. Now we consider $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Then it is easy to see that $_{1+\epsilon}\overset{n}{\Delta} \rightarrow \infty$. In particular, there exists $N$ large enough so that $_{1+\epsilon}\overset{N}{\Delta} \geq x$. Moreover, for $n \geq N$, we have $_{1+\epsilon}\overset{n}{\Delta} \geq x$. By montonicity of the triangle power, this means that $1+\epsilon \geq \overset{n}{\Delta}_x = \;_x\overset{1/n}{\Delta} \geq 1$. This corresponds exactly to saying that $_x\overset{1/n}{\Delta} \rightarrow 1$. Using $_{1/x}\overset{1/n}{\Delta} = \left(\; _x\overset{1/n}{\Delta} \right)^{-1}$ and monotonocity, we can generalize this result for all $x&gt;0$ and rational top. Namely, for any $x&gt;0$ and $\epsilon &gt;0$, there exists some $\delta&gt;0$ such that for any rational $r \in (1-\delta,1+\delta) \cap \mathbb Q$, we have $\left|\;_x\overset{r}{\Delta} – 1\right| \leq \epsilon$.</p>
<p>In other words, the right side of the triangle of power is sort of continuous with respect to rational tops.</p>
<p>This is almost what we’ve proved, and exactly where I’m going with that! Let’s show that if a rational sequence $r_n$ converges, then, for all $x &gt; 0$, the sequence $_x\overset{r_n}{\Delta}$ converges too. We have $ \left| \; …</p></div></div>

That's why blockchains are built to enable censorship-free financial access.</p><p>As CoinDesk noted <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-wallet-regulations-industry-pros">in a recent analysis of the situation</a>, there exists a revealing difference in the language used to refer to crypto wallets by regulators and crypto investors.</p><p>Regulators call crypto wallets <em>unhosted wallets,</em> whereas investors refer to them as <em>self-hosted wallets</em>. The difference here is all about privacy — crypto users believe in financial independence, freedom from oversight, and digital asset autonomy.</p><p>On the other hand, an unhosted wallet points to the view that such wallets lack hosting — a situation that should be remedied by regulation and the cooperation of centralized institutions.</p><p>This seemingly small difference in language does indeed point to a large divide in exactly how each side views the purpose of storing crypto assets.</p><p>As Armstrong noted in his original Twitter thread, the crypto industry has been preparing for this eventuality for at least a few months. In fact, they've known long enough to form a lobby, and have responded to the rumors by sending the US Treasury a plea to leave crypto alone.</p><p>The regulation is expected to come into effect before the year's end, mostly owing to the US election results and the impending changing of the guard. As such, the rush is on for Mnuchin to push through regulations before time is up.</p><p>Does data-collection on self-hosted crypto wallets amount to the US government declaring a ban on cryptocurrency wallets we know them?</p><p><strong>Not really</strong>.</p><p>Moreover, can the government enforce these regulations and push people onto the centralized platforms decentralized blockchains were built to avoid?</p><p>The answer there is clearer: <strong>certainly not.</strong></p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606858594054_28135"><div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>When my students bombed their first semester exam, it shocked me. It was my second year of teaching eighth grade math, and unlike the previous year, my students had actually done well on the exit tickets and tests up to that point. However, my students seemed to have forgotten everything.</p><p>The next semester, I made a concerted effort to carve out time for review, but it was tedious, and I never knew which specific topics to review, and how often to review each topic.</p><p>Years later when I was no longer a teacher, I found out that there was actually a science behind the best way to review, and that there was also <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a large body of research to back it up</a>.</p><h5>Ebbinghaus and the Forgetting Curve</h5><p>This body of research goes as far back as the 1880s, when a German psychologist named Hermann Ebbinghaus mapped out memory and how we forget over time.</p><p><img src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bo_Ae_Chun/publication/324816198/figure/fig1/AS:620205050982405@1524879815703/Ebbinghaus-forgetting-curve-and-review-cycle.png" alt="Forgetting Curve"></p><p>In his model of memory, Ebbignhaus stated that when content is first learned, without review, memory of that content deteriorates quickly. However, with each subsequent review and retrieval of that information, the memory becomes more durable, and over time, less and less review is required to keep retention fresh.</p><p>When I first learned about this, I felt an "Aha!" moment as Ebbinghaus broke down exactly why my students struggled when I was teaching.</p><p>For me, because planning out new lessons was already such a tough process, I never had enough time to adequately review throughout the school year. Instead, every year in March, I dedicated an entire month to review all of the content before the state exam. In fact, several lower-performing districts encouraged students and teachers to have â€œreview weeksâ€� to cram review before state assessments. We would power through countless hours of material that students had already "learned", but it never stuck as well as I would have liked.</p><p>Ebbinghaus proposed something that I had always intuitively known, but failed to put into practice in my own classroom: spreading out review over time is much more effective than cramming it all into one session.</p><h5>More Research</h5><p>Since Ebbinghuas, several researchers have fleshed out this idea of the forgetting curve and spaced review.</p><p>To start, <a href="https://pcl.sitehost.iu.edu/rgoldsto/courses/dunloskyimprovinglearning.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Dunlosky, a professor of psychological sciences at Kent State University, and others broke down 10 different learning techniques</a>, including common practices like re-reading and highlighting, and found that spaced review was one of the most effective ways to learn and retain knowledge and skills.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/~cogedlab/pubs/Kang(2016,PIBBS).pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sean Kang, a cognitive psychologist at the University of Melbourne, highlighted spaced review as a highly effective learning technique</a> that does not require more time and drastic changes to the classroom.</p><p>Specifically, he states:</p><blockquote><p>Incorporating spaced practice into education can be a cost-effective approachâ€” learning becomes more durable in the same amount of time (relative to massed practice), and this can lead to future savings because less time needs to be spent on relearning content that has been forgotten, leaving more time for other productive learning activities (e.g., higher order analysis, application of knowledge). <strong>In short, spaced practice enhances the efficacy and efficiency of learning, and it holds great promise as an educational tool.</strong></p></blockquote><p>In a different paper, <a href="https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lindsey-et-al.-2014.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Lindsey, another research scientist and now the founder of Imagen Technologies, and others also assessed the efficacy of a computer program that personalized review for each student over time</a>. In this study, personalized spaced review improved retention by 16.5%!</p><p>The more research I read, the more I was perplexed â€”perplexed as to why I hadn't learned about this research-backed learning technique while I was teaching. I had sat through countless hours of professional development and undergone a long certification process, but I had never once heard about how to maximize learning in my classroom through spaced review.</p><p>Clearly, there was a gap between research and practical application, and I wanted to see if there was a way to fill that gap.</p><h5>Spacing in the Classroom</h5><p>So how would spaced review work in the classroom?</p><p>After I learned about spaced review, I shared it with my best friend, Chris, who is currently a science teacher in Texas. He also dug into the research and was excited to try it out in his classroom the next school year. He did a deep dive into all of the learning tools available to help him facilitate spaced review in the classroom. Most tools he came across seemed better suited for individual learners, and were not well-suited for the classroom.</p><p>Long story short, Chris and I decided to build out Podsie, a platform that fully automates spaced review in a personalized way for each student. With Podsie, Chris creates an exit ticket of around 5-8 questions that assesses the content that students learned that day. When students complete a question, the question goes into that student's personal deck.</p><p>Each student's personal deck is powered by a spacing algorithm that determines when the student should review a question again. Then, Chris gives his students 10 minutes in the beginning of class to complete every question that is due on their personal decks, ensuring that each student reviews exactly what they should be reviewing on that day.</p><p>With this approach, Chris no longer has to do the traditional cram session before state assessments. This year, even with distance learning, the spaced review has been so effective for him that he's decided to completely cut out that month of review that he also traditionally did. Like the quote from Sean Kang above predicted, spacing out review saved Chris a significant amount of time because "less time needs to be spent on relearning content that has been forgotten."</p><h5>Last Thoughts</h5><p>In Sean Kang's paper on spacing, he reflects:</p><blockquote><p>Despite over a century of research findings demonstrating the spacing effect, however, it does not have widespread application in the classroom. <strong>The spacing effect is â€œa case study in the failure to apply the results of psychological researchâ€� (Dempster, 1988, p. 627).</strong></p></blockquote><p>Podsie hopes to be that bridge between psychological research and the classroom.</p><p>We know this year has been extraordinarily challenging for everyone in the education system, and we hope that by providing an effective and efficient tool, each student and teacher's life can be made a little easier.</p><p><strong><em>If you're interested in using Podsie in your classroom to help with your students' retention of content, you can <a href="https://www.podsie.org/#sign-up">sign up here!</a></em></strong></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I got into the habit of dumping quick blog post ideas into issues on my blog’s repo. It’s a convenient place to iterate on them and share with friends for feedback before actually publishing on my blog post.</p><p><img src="https://shazow.net/posts/github-issues-as-a-hugo-frontend/100761218-a6cb2280-33c0-11eb-92df-1b52d91cc16e.png" alt="image"></p><p>The drafts keep accumulating, how do I trick myself into publishing more? Perhaps by reducing the effort required for the next step? Let’s do it!</p><h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2><p>My blog is statically generated using <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo">Hugo</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/shazow/shazow.net">code is hosted on Github</a>, then when a pull request comes in it is built, previewed, and published on merge by <a href="https://netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.</p><p>The blog post drafts are posted as Github issues, so there is a clear gap: How do we convert issues into pull requests for Netlify? Enter Github Actions!</p><h2 id="github-action-issue-to-pull-request">Github Action: Issue to Pull Request</h2><p>My <a href="https://github.com/shazow/shazow.net/blob/master/.github/workflows/publish.yml">full workflow lives here</a> if we want to jump ahead, but let’s break down the broad strokes.</p><p>I decided to trigger the publishing process once an issue is labelled with ‘publish’, so let’s start with that:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span>Publish<span> </span>post<span> </span>from<span> </span>issue<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>on</span><span>:</span><span>

</span><span></span><span>jobs</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>build</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>if</span><span>:</span><span> </span>${{<span> </span>github.event.label.name<span> </span>==<span> </span><span>'publish'</span><span> </span>}}<span>

</span><span>    </span><span>steps</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>...<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Next up we want to specify the steps, first thing is to check out the repository into the action’s environment:</p><p>Once the source code is available, we want to generate the blog post from the issue metadata. Here is a very basic version of this, though I ended up doing more tweaking in the end:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>      </span>- <span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span>Generate<span> </span>Post<span>
</span><span>        </span><span>env</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>          </span><span>POST_TITLE</span><span>:</span><span> </span>${{<span> </span>github.event.issue.title<span> </span>}}<span>
</span><span>          </span><span>POST_BODY</span><span>:</span><span> </span>${{<span> </span>github.event.issue.body<span> </span>}}<span>
</span><span>        </span><span>run</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>|
</span><span>          cat &gt; "content/posts/${POST_TITLE}.md" &lt;&lt; EOF</span><span>
</span><span>          </span>${POST_BODY}<span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p><em>Don’t forget to&nbsp;<a href="https://get.acloudguru.com/reinvent2020">throw in your email address</a>&nbsp;to get an executive summary in your inbox from ACG each day of re:Invent!</em></p><p>AWS, you sneaky devils.</p><p>Look at the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/eks-anywhere/faqs/">FAQ for EKS Anywhere</a>, announced yesterday for a 2021 launch, and you’ll find plenty of references to “on-premises”, bare metal compute, and VSphere. AWS’s stated rationale for expanding access to their managed Kubernetes service is all about hybrid cloud, which traditionally has meant “your old busted servers plus AWS’s shiny goodness.”</p><p>But wait … EKS Anywhere<em>? </em>Does that really mean <em>anywhere</em>?</p><p>Could it mean … Azure?</p><p>Lo and behold, <a href="https://www.protocol.com/aws-multicloud-era">Protocol has obtained confirmation</a> that EKS Anywhere (and technically ECS Anywhere, but let’s be real, if you want to run on multiple cloud providers you’re using Kubernetes) <strong>will support workloads running on Azure and GCP as well as private data centers</strong>. AWS is giving you a single pane of glass that will let you roll out config updates, instrument monitoring, and connect other app services to container workloads on your cloud of choice.</p><p>That’s right: AWS just rolled out a multi-cloud container management service.</p><p>You are now permitted thirty seconds to pick your jaw off the floor.</p><h2 id="h-what-does-aws-gain-from-doing-this">What does AWS gain from doing this?</h2><p>This marks … shall we say … a bit of a departure from AWS’s classic “one cloud to rule them all” rhetoric. After all, at various other times in Tuesday’s re:Invent keynote Andy Jassy unleashed <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/babelfish/">a frontal assault on Microsoft SQL Server</a>, dunked gleefully on archnemesis-turned-punching-bag Oracle, and found GCP so unthreatening that he closed his presentation, without comment, on a song lyric that used “Google” as a verb.</p><p>And yet multi-cloud is here to stay, and Jassy knows it.</p><p>Check out my recent piece <a href="https://cloudirregular.substack.com/p/aws-hearts-multi-cloud-its-gonna">“AWS Hearts Multi-Cloud”</a> for a full analysis of why, but here’s the gist. <a href="https://cloudpundit.com/2020/09/18/the-multicloud-gelatinous-cube/"><strong>Multi-cloud is a gravitational inevitability for enterprises</strong></a>. ACG’s recent <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/news/a-cloud-guru-unveils-state-of-cloud-learning-report">State of Cloud Learning Report</a> found that while about 75% of cloud shops still use AWS as their primary cloud provider, the same 75% also have at least some workloads running on Azure or another cloud. Could be due to acquisition, service envy, bet-hedging, or simple lack of coordination – or all of the above. Reality is messy and getting more so.</p><p>AWS has a huge head start on the rest of the cloud industry, but 75% of people won’t think of AWS as their “primary” cloud provider forever. Not when there are so many best-of-breed services to choose from, both on other clouds and on focused SaaS providers like Snowflake and Datadog. And certainly not given that plenty of industries have active incentive to avoid deep integration with a cloud provider owned by Amazon.</p><p>So AWS has a limited window of opportunity to keep that central status in cloud teams’ hearts. Providing higher-level, cross-cloud management tools is the easiest way to do it. The other cloud providers certainly get this; Azure isn’t hamstrung by an inability to admit the validity of AWS workloads, and they’re rushing into the breach with tools like Arc and Sentinel.</p><h2 id="h-this-is-only-the-beginning">This is only the beginning</h2><p>Really, the amazing thing is that AWS spun the “Anywhere” releases so adroitly, and described them so diffusely, that it took a day to confirm that multi-cloud was really their intent. And they can’t keep playing both sides much longer. They need to signal to large customers that yes, they get that Azure isn’t going away, and they’ll provide the tools to continue deserving the status of <em>preferred </em>cloud provider even if they can’t be the <em>only </em>cloud provider.</p><p>If you think that’s a bridge too far, you haven’t been paying attention to what makes AWS tick. I closed my last multi-cloud piece by pointing out that AWS created ECS because they have great engineers; they sell EKS because they are smart. As long as they are willing to cannibalize their own offerings in pursuit of customer value, they will remain hard to beat.</p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My ears are perking up at <a href="https://twitter.com/ajassy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ajassy</a>'s comments about working with third parties, not being afraid of cannibalizing yourself, etc … are we revving up to the announcement of AWS's much-ballyhooed multicloud play? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/reinvent?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#reinvent</a></p>— Forrest Brazeal @re:Invent 2020 (@forrestbrazeal) <a href="https://twitter.com/forrestbrazeal/status/1333806720993333250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2020</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>Lo and behold, Jassy echoed the same themes in his keynote. And while he never used the word “multi-cloud” (not yet!), you can be sure that EKS Anywhere isn’t a one-off or an accident. It’s the first glimpse of a massive strategic shift. Because once you realize what yesterday’s emphasis on “hybrid, open-source” rhetoric really means, it’s clear that AWS’s multi-cloud play is just beginning.</p></div></div></div>]]>

    <section>
<p>It’s fairly common for folks who haven’t used mutation testing before to not immediately see
the value in the practice. Mutation testing is, after all, still a fairly niche and under-used
tool in the average software development team’s toolbox. So today I’m going to show a few specific
types of <em>very</em> common problems that mutation testing is great at finding for us, and that
are hard or impossible to find with other methods. This is the code that we’ll be working with
today:</p>

<p>Here’s what <code>cover</code> says about our tests:</p>
<p><img src="http://devonestes.com/images/cover_example.png" alt="cover output"></p>
<p>We can see here that we have 100% code coverage, so we should be all good in terms of testing,
right? There’s no way we could have any bugs here, and there’s <em>definitely</em> no way we can
reasonably break this code without causing a failing test.</p>
<p><strong>Just kidding!!</strong> Neither of those two functions work at the moment, and we’re not testing all of
the behavior in either of them despite “100% code coverage,” so it’s really easy to introduce a
regression without causing a failing test.</p>
<h2>The “multiple execution paths on a single line” problem</h2>
<p>In our test for the <code>stringify_keys/1</code> function, and the <code>cover</code> output for that test, we can see
that we’re testing both branches in the <code>if</code> statement in that function. But our test for that
function only passes a tuple as a key and never a map! So, if we were to change that code to be:</p>

<p>we wouldn’t see a failing test. This could be correct behavior, or we could be introducing a bug
that might cause real problems for the users of our software - we just don’t know, because that
behavior isn’t tested anywhere! This is one of the huge ways in which “code coverage” that just
counts by lines of code executed in a test run falls short: it assumes that each line of code
contains a single execution path through the code in question, and that’s <strong>often</strong> wrong.</p>
<p>Mutation testing, on the other hand, shows us if we’re missing test cases based on the <strong>logic</strong>
in our code instead of based on the <strong>lines</strong> in our code. I think we can all agree that this is a
far better measure of code coverage for an application, right?</p>
<h2>The “untested side effect” problem</h2>
<p>At first glance, the code in our <code>write_json_to_file/2</code> function might <em>seem</em> correct, and it
certainly is doing <em>something</em>, but based on those variable names I don’t think it’s actually
doing what we want. If you run this test, you might see a strange file created on your filesystem:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat '{"test":"map"}'
tmp/CoverExampleTest/test-write_json_to_file-2-gives-us-the-correct-JSON</code></pre>
<p>Yep - the file path and the file contents are switched! And yet we have 100% code coverage and
no failing tests, so all the feedback we’re getting is telling us that things are good. This is
because we have an <strong>untested side effect</strong> in that function. And the real kicker is, like 90% of
the really important and useful stuff that happens in most applications are <strong>side effects</strong>. If
we’re not testing them, then we’re running a really high likelihood of a regression in an
important part of our application.</p>
<h2>The “missing pin” problem</h2>
<p>Those first two problems I’d say are the biggest things that mutation testing can find for you
that you <em>can’t</em> easily find through things like looking at code coverage based on LOC. This next
problem however, is much more rare (although I still see it at least a couple times a year) and
very Elixir specific, so I figured I’d include it here today.</p>
<p>Our test for <code>write_json_to_file/2</code> is currently passing even though we’re probably not doing what
the developer wanted it to do. Why could that be?</p>
<p>We’re missing a <code>^</code>! The <code>^</code> (called the “pin operator”) is used to avoid re-binding a variable in
a pattern match, but it’s <em>super</em> easy to forget them in tests, or to use the match operator <code>=</code>
in place of the equality operator <code>==</code> in a test. In either of those cases, you’ll end up with a
passing test where you shouldn’t have one.</p>
<p>If we change <code>assert expected = stringified</code> to <code>assert ^expected = stringified</code> or
<code>assert expected == stringified</code> we’ll see the failure that the developer who wrote that code
probably intended to show. Mutation testing can give us this feedback to at least let us know that
there’s something that’s still not quite right and might need some additional human intervention
to resolve.</p>
<h2>Use computers instead of humans</h2>
<p>The most important thing to note here is that currently, without mutation testing, the only way
you’ll get feedback about these issues is from a human giving it to you. Either you’ll figure it
out yourself as you’re working on the code, or maybe someone will pick it up in a PR review, or
you’ll get a bug report from a QA tester or a user. But for most teams there’s no automated way of
getting this feedback quickly and easily that will scale with a development team as it grows -
this is where mutation testing comes in!</p>
<p>Code coverage is yet another thing that roughly follows the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto Principle</a>. Code coverage based on lines
of code executed gets you 80% of the way there and takes 20% of the effort. It’s easy to do, and
it’s pretty good! But for applications that need (or want) a higher level of coverage, they’re
going to need something like mutation testing to give them that extra 20% that other tools and
techniques just can’t offer.</p>

        <strong>Rebase</strong> is a new conference for and by practitioners who want to engage academics about tomorrow's technologies while fondly recalling the achievements of yesterday.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This year, <strong>Rebase</strong> was planned to occur twice, once in Berlin
        with the <a href="https://2020.ecoop.org/">ECOOP</a> conference and
        once in Chicago with the <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/">SPLASH</a> conference.
        Due to outside forces, there will be a single virtual event.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Rebase</strong> will use the Clowdr platform for interaction,
        registration allows attendees to ask questions and meet with each other
        and with speaker. Registration also give access to all of the
        <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/">SPLASH</a> co-located events.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Rebase is free. All talks were streamed live and are now available on <br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyrlk8Xaylp6aNlOgiyE4W30X7DpXx74m"><i></i>&nbsp;YouTube</a>.</strong>

<p>The growth of AI and machine learning (ML) has led researchers to think, research and stress the development of ethical AI solutions - with AI models / solutions able to provide:</p>
<!--more-->
<ul>
<li>Explainability &amp; Interpretability</li>
<li>Privacy&nbsp;</li>
<li>Fairness</li>
<li>Model Governance</li>
</ul>
<p>The concept of privacy introduced for ML has been extended from individual / standalone models to distributed training such as federated learning. Here models trained locally are sent to decentralized servers that aggregate model weights and inferences from several individual devices to yield an aggregated ensemble model of greater privacy and trust. With further extensive AI research and translating research to productionizing solutions, hybrid ML models find its usage in different industrial domains.</p>
<p>Such hybrid models built using Differential Privacy at Application level and Secured Transfer Protocol at transport level have been used extensively to build scalable solutions in the following industry domains.</p>
<ul>
<li>Distributed Control Systems</li>
<li>Industrial IoT Systems</li>
<li>Supply Chain</li>
<li>Retail</li>
<li>Financial Services</li>
<li>Health Care</li>
<li>Automotives and Electrical vehicles&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<ol>
<li>Differential Privacy applications developed by software giant's Google, Apple, Microsoft</li>
<li>Differential Privacy for Location Based Services</li>
<li>Differential Privacy for IoT Sensors for Edge and Fog Computing</li>
</ol>
<p>Our discussion remains confined within the scope of Local Differential Privacy where each user is responsible for maintaining a differentially private mechanism to their <strong>own</strong> data through addition of noise mechanisms. To know more about Global vs Local Differential Privacy refer to <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/local-global-differential-privacy.html%C2%A0" rel="noopener">this article</a>.</p>
<h2><span>Local Differential Privacy (LDP) Based Solutions</span></h2>
<h3><span>Rappor By Google</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/42852.pdf" rel="noopener">RAPPOR (Randomized Aggregatable Privacy-Preserving Ordinal Response)</a> implemented in Chrome browse collects data from opt-in users, tens of millions per day by Tracking in&nbsp; settings in the browser, e.g. home page, search engine and protects them from unwanted or malicious hijacking. It eliminates the need for a trusted third party server and puts control over client’s data back into their direct control.</p>
<p>It works on the principle of randomized response that provides strong Differential Privacy (DP) guarantee and protection. It operates by collecting statistics on sensitive topics by crowdsourcing from end-users, through client-side software where survey respondents wish to retain confidentiality. The RAPPOR mechanism is performed locally on the client, and does not require a trusted third party. In terms of frequency, the data from clients where data is collected repeatedly (or even infinitely often).</p>
<p>RAPPOR can be used to collect statistics on categorical client properties, by having each bit in a client’s response represent whether, or not, that client belongs to a category.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It functions by limiting the number of correlated categories, or Bloom filter hash functions, reported by any single client. This helps RAPPOR to maintain its differential-privacy (DP) guarantees even when statistics are collected on multiple aspects of clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The foremost limitation of RAPPOR is Its slowness and limited application.</p>
<h3><span>LDP in IOS, IPhone, Mac - Apple Products</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_differential_privacy" rel="noopener">Local Differential Privacy (LDP)</a>, applied on the platforms used by Apple works on the principle of&nbsp; statistical noise that is slightly biased and can mask a user’s individual data before it is shared with Apple. On receiving similar data inputs from several people, the added noise helps to average out large numbers of data points, thereby setting a clear inference before Apple which they can use as their benefit to derive meaningful information.</p>
<p>It uses the principle of privacy budget (quantified by the parameter epsilon), and sets a strict limit on the number of contributions from a user in order to preserve their privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suitable metrics with insights improves the intelligence and usability from the following applications. In addition, it also protects the privacy of user activity in a given time period</p>
<ul>
<li>QuickType suggestions</li>
<li>Emoji suggestions</li>
<li>Lookup Hints&nbsp;</li>
<li>Safari Energy Draining Domains</li>
<li>Safari Autoplay Intent Detection (macOS High Sierra)</li>
<li>Safari Crashing Domains (iOS 11)</li>
<li>Health Type Usage (iOS 10.2)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Count Mean Sketch technique allows Apple to determine the most popular emoji to help design better ways to find and use our favorite emoji.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Count Mean Sketch and Hadamard Count Mean–based Sketch techniques for differential privacy relies on noise addition along with hash encoding using a series of mathematical functions.</p>
<p>Apple Sketches and Transform count frequencies of items/typing statistics. Apple uses their system to collect data from iOS and OS X users Popular emojis, popular words, which websites to mute and where to play audio.</p>
<p>The system is composed of Ingestor and Aggregator where private info like IP is stripped off and processed in a batch that removes metadata, such as the timestamps of privatized records received, and separates these records based on their use case.</p>
<p>The architecture strives to obtain a tradeoff among factors, including privacy, utility, server computation overhead, and device bandwidth, without lowering accuracy.</p>
<h3><span>Local Differential Privacy&nbsp; in Microsoft Products</span></h3>
<p>Microsoft leveraged Local Differential Privacy (LDP) to protect user privacy in several applications, including telemetry in Windows (used by millions of users), advertiser queries in LinkedIn, suggested replies in Office, and manager dashboards in Workplace Analytics which is a pluggable open source library of differentially private algorithms.</p>
<p>The DP platform provided by Microsoft provides a <span>host of components that can be flexibly configured, allowing big data specialists to use the best and right set of services for their environments.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2020/05/19/new-differential-privacy-platform-microsoft-harvard-opendp/"><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zIFIysy5VB-XCPLAS0bkOHfGkn845bAZq11Qy_bgi4-FLikmdt-SiW_dZn9wxnIh2jlIq7jnqoaHwBVFTypuqnYrszj0UnMxtpyJ80C9Ez_zv8-mY3Z9A_6nMyqA9uD-_gRqB358" width="835"></span></a></p>
<p><em><a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2020/05/19/new-differential-privacy-platform-microsoft-harvard-opendp/" rel="noopener">Image source</a></em></p>
<p>The framework is equipped with mechanisms related to implementations based on mature differential privacy research and APIs for defining an analysis. Each analysis is supported by suitable validation techniques for estimating the total privacy loss.</p>
<p><span>The Telemetry private data collection employs:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>1BitMean to collect numeric data, independently from different users</li>
<li>dBitFlip to collect (sparse) histogram data from each user independently, distributed across buckets.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Microsoft’s DP design principles <em>“the continuous collection of counter data is strong when the user's behavior remains approximately the same, varies slowly, or varies around a small number of values over the course of data collection”.</em></p>
<p>Memoization and perturbation techniques applied by Microsoft in the context of private collection of counters, avoids substantial losses in accuracy or privacy, functioning well when data is collected over long periods of time.</p>
<h2><span>Challenges</span></h2>
<p>The real challenge in scaling DP solutions lies in its integration into real-world environments with highly customized data structures. Further it also needs good KPIs for performance and reliability. Legacy DP systems require modification to existing data pipelines or replacement of database engines, while integrating to ML systems and Big Data pipelines.</p>
<p>For edge computing the challenge lies in limitations of individual edge-servers in detecting threats. Edge servers are middleware components that can serve as a distillation point for sensitive data before they are sent to the cloud. Further, when edge servers become the centre of data processing and storage, then they may not have enough resources to protect themselves.</p>
<p>To develop a safe ecosystem for edge-computing, it’s essential to design a scalable, efficient, and decentralized security mechanism.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span>Differential Privacy for Location Based Services</span></h2>
<p>For automotives and related location-based services real-time data processing along with preserving location privacy are essential for providing security&nbsp; to the driver. Edge-computing can be seen as a promising solution to offer efficient differentially privacy-preserving&nbsp; location-based services where computing and storage resources can be placed at the network&nbsp; edge. Edge nodes (e.g., road side</p>
<p>infrastructures and base stations) takes the responsibility from remote-servers to provide privacy enabled solutions&nbsp; by ensuring location privacy in its coverage by balancing both utility and privacy.</p>
<p>The fundamental principle in building&nbsp; the framework lies in creating two services, Differentially Privacy-preserving&nbsp; Location-based Service Usage (Pri-LBS) mechanism and Privacy Level Adjustment (PLA) module, which are designed to enable vehicles to request useful information based on&nbsp; the&nbsp; submitted&nbsp; location&nbsp; without&nbsp; revealing&nbsp; their&nbsp; location privacy.&nbsp; Any vehicle registered with this service first submits its location to the edge node. The edge node executes the privacy-preserving mechanism by …</p></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

December 2, 2020 | https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2020/topology_graphs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2020/topology_graphs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>I have written at lengths about certain aspects of topological data
analysis, but I have neglected to discuss one of its main applications,
i.e. the classification of graphs. In this post, I will therefore take
you on a quick tour of our ICML paper <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/rieck19a/rieck19a.pdf">A Persistent Weisfeiler–Lehman Procedure for Graph Classification</a>.</p>
<p>Let us assume that we are given a graph with node label information. The
graph could, for instance, be a molecule, whose nodes are atoms such as
carbon or oxygen, and whose edges indicate chemical bonds. The goal
could now be to classify a given molecule into a set of classes, such as
‘toxic’, ‘carcinogen’, etc. How can we achieve such a classification?
One of the simplest techniques dates back to the 1960s and involves
calculating an <em>iterative fingerprint</em> of the graph! This procedure was
suggested by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Weisfeiler">Boris Weisfeiler</a>
and Andrei Lehman&nbsp;(sometimes also transliterated as ‘Leman’) in
their seminal article <a href="https://www.iti.zcu.cz/wl2018/pdf/wl_paper_translation.pdf">The reduction of a graph to canonical form and the
algebra which appears therein</a>.</p>
<p>At its core, the algorithm is an iteration scheme that works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>For a node $v$, collect its label and the labels of adjacent nodes in
a multiset.</li>
<li>Assign this multiset a new label by hashing it—with the proviso
that the hashing function is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function"><em>perfect</em></a>, i.e.
it maps distinct labels to distinct values with no collisions.</li>
<li>Replace all node labels by their multiset hashes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Intuitively, each step of the algorithm accumulates more information
from nodes that are further removed from the current node. The hashed
multiset label is thus an expression of the neighbourhood around
a node—and after a sufficiently large number of iterations, the
hashed labels will not change any more.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you are dealing with this simple graph&nbsp;(to
prevent confusion of node labels and node IDs, I used <em>colours</em> to
indicate node labels in this example):</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/weisfeiler_lehman_graph.svg" alt="Weisfeiler--Lehman example graph" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>Tabulating the neighbourhood of each node then results in the following
table:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/weisfeiler_lehman_table_1.svg" alt="Weisfeiler--Lehman multiset example (before hashing)" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>Now for the hashing step. In this example, <em>perfect hashing</em> means
choosing a set of colours that is distinct for every distinct
combination of neighbourhood labels and vertex labels:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/weisfeiler_lehman_table_2.svg" alt="Weisfeiler--Lehman multiset example (after hashing)" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>Notice how nodes A, B, and G are hashed to the same colour—because
in the first iteration of the algorithm, they cannot be distinguished.
How can we use the information about the hashed labels in a subsequent
comparison task? The answer is lies in <em>counting</em> them in a histogram
vector, which is indexed by the unique labels—this is where our
requirement of the perfect hashing function is helpful. For the
previously-shown graph, it looks like this:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/weisfeiler_lehman_feature_vector.svg" alt="Weisfeiler--Lehman subtree feature vector" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>The <em>fingerprint</em> of this graph, according to the first iteration of the
Weisfeiler–Lehman scheme is therefore $(3, 1, 2, 1)$. Further iterations
just make the feature vector longer&nbsp;(technically, the initial
labels already give rise to a feature vector of counts). This procedure
can now be repeated for higher-order iterations and the resulting
feature vectors can be compared across graphs by evaluating, for
example, their dot product. More formalisations of this idea have
resulted in the very successful <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume12/shervashidze11a/shervashidze11a.pdf">Weisfeiler–Lehman Graph
Kernels</a>
publication. This method arguably constitutes the basis for graph neural
networks—in fact, these networks can be seen as a parametrised
version of the Weisfeiler–Lehman iteration scheme. But I digress—if
you are interested in these aspects, please read <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/beyond-weisfeiler-lehman-approximate-isomorphisms-and-metric-embeddings-f7b816b75751">Michael Bronstein’s
article on going beyond graph
isomorphism</a>
for more details.</p>
<p>Now, despite its great practical utility, this feature vector is lacking
some <em>structural</em> information about the graph. It does not know whether
a certain label contributes much to the topological structure of
a graph—such as a ring of carbon atoms would in molecule—or not. To
this end, we introduced a notion of topological relevance for each node
label! Briefly put, we first developed a distance metric that would
permit us turn any <em>labelled</em> graph into a <em>weighted</em> graph. We then
calculate a persistence barcode, a topological descriptor of the graph.
This descriptor assesses the relevance of a topological feature created
by some node label. We use the topological relevance of each feature as
an additional <em>weight</em> for the previously-shown feature vector. In
essence, labels that contribute a large amount of topological structure
in a graph are assigned a higher weight than labels that only contribute
a meagre amount!</p>
<p>Here is a graphical depiction of our process:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/p_wl_pipeline.svg" alt="Persistent Weisfeiler--Lehman pipeline" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>If you want to brush up your understanding of the barcode calculation,
head on over to <a href="https://christian.bock.ml/">Christian’s website</a>; he has
an <a href="https://christian.bock.ml/posts/persistent_homology">excellent article on persistent
homology</a>.</p>
<p>The neat thing about our approach is that we can easily integrate
information about <em>cycles</em> into the feature vector—this is
a functionality that the original Weisfeiler–Lehman Graph Kernels
Framework lacks. Moreover, these cycles turn out to be crucial in
improving classification performance—we get an increase of more than
3% in classification accuracy by considering them in some data sets!</p>
<p>If this has whet your appetite, I invite you to <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/rieck19a/rieck19a.pdf">read our
paper</a> or <a href="https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/P-WL">take
a look at the code</a>. If you want
to learn more about graph classification using graph kernels, take
a look at our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03854">recent survey on graph kernels</a>,
which will hopefully be officially announced in time for NeurIPS 2020.
In the best tradition of Fermat, I would very much like to cover the
content of the survey here, but this blog is too small to contain all of
it—maybe for a subsequent post?</p>
<p>Until next time!</p>

After nearly a year and tens of thousands of dollars — we launched it.</p><p id="d4d8">Ghost town. Crickets. Nobody wanted what we’d built.</p><p id="998b">I determined that the missing piece of the puzzle was my <a rel="noopener" href="https://mgadams.com/want-to-learn-to-code-start-with-excel-4f5902fb1b2f?source=collection_home---6------0-----------------------">lack of technical ability</a>, so I enrolled as one of the first dozen students at a now-famous<a href="https://www.hackreactor.com/" rel="noopener"> coding bootcamp</a> and actually got a job as a software engineer at a <a href="http://opentable.com/" rel="noopener">real company</a>.</p><p id="3b53">So surely when I started my <a href="https://twitter.com/missionu?lang=en" rel="noopener">next start-up</a>, this time things would be different. This time we talked to dozens of potential users and industry experts before we built anything. This time it worked. Sort of.</p><p id="d494">Our mission was compelling as we launched to <a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/201806/leigh-buchanan/missionu-career-training-school.html" rel="noopener">fanfare</a> and raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/14/missionu-raises-8-5m-to-build-an-alternative-one-year-education-program/" rel="noopener">$11.5M</a> within 10 months of founding the company. However, after just two years we were acqui-hired, our investors got their money back, and the product was immediately <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2018/05/23/missionu-self-styled-alternative-higher-education-closes-after" rel="noopener">shut down</a>.</p><p id="6863">I was gutted, still am TBH.</p><p id="0f28">But with hindsight, I could look back to my original research notes and see I had ignored several fatal warnings. I had listened to what they said — exactly as they said it, but I did not realize until much later that I failed to actually understand what they meant.</p><p id="9305">So if I wanted to avoid failing a third time, I needed to figure out what I was missing about how to <em>really</em> understand users.</p><p id="9c98">Marty Cagan, Silicon Valley Product Group founder and former PM at early eBay, says there are “<a href="https://svpg.com/the-inconvenient-truth-about-product/" rel="noopener">two inconvenient truths about product</a>.”</p><p id="b881">Truth #1: <strong>At least half of our ideas are just not going to work</strong>:</p><p id="ed0c">Truth #2: <strong>Even the good ideas take several iterations to become viable.</strong></p><p id="3d8c">My experience has also been that there’s simply no escaping these inconvenient truths — I only wish I would have learned about them sooner.</p><p id="30d3">It doesn’t matter how smart or experienced we may be, statistically speaking, most of our ideas are simply not going to work. And the successful ones take time and hard work to turn into a real product that gets widely adopted by a market.</p><p id="de93">Your ideas are not nearly as important as your process — and the best process starts with understanding what the customers you wish to serve <em>already</em> do to solve their problems today and even more importantly, understanding why.</p><p id="9883">Yet, even as a 3rd time founder, I fell into the trap of ignoring the two inconvenient truths <em>again.</em></p><p id="87c7">Confirmation bias is a hell of a drug.</p><p id="f8b7">When we started <a href="http://grain.co/?utm_source=medium" rel="noopener">grain.co</a> two years ago, we began with a specific product solution in mind, built prototypes, and got feedback from users. They told us they’d love to use it but after months turning prototypes into a product, few actually did.</p><p id="a400">So we started over from scratch, but this time with a different approach:</p><ol><li id="2be7">Focus on a very specific user type with a very specific job to be done.</li><li id="bb56">Interview dozens of them only to understand how and why they solve their problem today.</li></ol><p id="0128">Our goal was not to validate whether the merit of a specific solution but to observe existing customer behaviors and desires as a means of generating new ideas for potential product solutions.</p><p id="3dec">This is what is known as <strong>generative research</strong>.</p><p id="4699">As you listen to your target market describe what they do today to solve their problems, you can better understand potential customers’ existing incentives, behaviors, and desires in anticipation for how they’d react to a new solution.</p><p id="331b"><a href="https://twitter.com/robfitz" rel="noopener">Rob Fitzpatrick</a> has famously coined this generative research phase “ <a href="http://momtestbook.com/" rel="noopener">The Mom Test</a>,” which is a set of simple rules to ask good questions so that even your Mom can’t lie to you in her answers to protect your ego.</p><p id="7e65">Generative research questions are focused on understanding existing behavior. For example, here are some questions from an interview guide we used at <a href="http://grain.co/" rel="noopener">Grain</a> to understand how our prospective users already document and share information from live meetings:</p><ul><li id="fcb3">What’s your current process to document and share information from a video meeting?</li><li id="fa1f">How important is it that the information you document and share is accurate?</li><li id="6568">What measures do you currently take to ensure accuracy of captured information?</li><li id="33f9">What can happen if your documentation is inaccurate?</li><li id="32f3">How often are you in conversations where you don’t need to document or share anything?</li><li id="cda6">Which types of conversations are the most important for you to document and share?</li></ul><p id="9e72">Be sure to avoid hypothetical questions about what people <em>might</em> do. Don’t try to validate your future product with questions that begin with “would you use this” or “what do you think about the possibility of” — that’s what we call leading the witness, and it will inevitably bias your data and waste your time building the wrong thing. At this stage, you simply need to observe what users are <em>already doing,</em> not what they might theoretically do.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="69d3">I recently connected with <a href="https://twitter.com/robfitz" rel="noopener">Rob</a> where he shared an updated model of 3 ways where users will lie to you if you’re not careful:</p><ol><li id="afa0">Asking the wrong questions</li><li id="6697">Remembering the wrong thing</li><li id="6a57">Making the wrong decision “justified” by what you think you heard</li></ol><p id="ecb1">Rob and most other researchers suggest asking for permission from their interviewees to record these interviews and take time-annotated notes that will help them to accurately remember and codify behavioral patterns that could eventually help to define <a href="https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2019/02/the-pitfalls-of-personas-and-advantages-of-jobs-to-be-done.php" rel="noopener">“jobs to be done”</a> that product, engineering, and design teams can build for with confidence.</p><p id="556d">After gaining insights about the problems your target market faces in generative research, you may be confident enough to test out a specific product solution to see if these users would actually value it.</p><p id="4717">This is the concept behind <strong>evaluative testing</strong>.</p><p id="f326">At this early stage, you want to put an <em>ultra-lightweight implementation </em>of a product solution in front of your target users to see how they react. While the closer to reality your prototype is the better, it doesn’t need to be a fully functional product yet: designs on paper, prototypes, mock-ups-anything like that will work.</p><p id="b1b0">Your goal at this stage is to get clear qualitative signals that users:</p><ol><li id="9f21">understand the proposed product solution</li><li id="fcda">express unmistakable excitement about the prospect of the product as a superior solution to the status quo</li></ol><p id="2033">Unfortunately, all too many product teams speed through this testing or skip it all together and simply march ahead to engineering and delivery. Depending on the complexity of the market and the problem you’re trying to solve, this stage could take months or, in some cases, years.</p><p id="d10d">That might sound discouraging and time-consuming, but I know this for certain: the success of your product will be <strong><em>directly proportiona</em>l</strong> to the quality of work done in this initial customer discovery phase. It’s worth doing it, and it’s certainly worth doing it well.</p><p id="0fd4">Even if your team creates something that people want, if customers can’t figure out how to use it, the product is dead in the water. This is why product teams conduct usability testing throughout the build process.</p><p id="ee09">The traditional approach to usability interviews is to set up a test environment, where we watch as a user navigates the product. An interviewer encourages a user to explain what they see, think, and observe. The interviewer also offers prompts for what the user might consider next if they get stuck using the product. Usability issues in the product become self-evident in most of these cases.</p><p id="8825">My friend <a href="https://medium.com/u/b2d49a9606e3?source=post_page-----c68feaecac44--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Behzod Sirjani</a>, has created a framework for conducting usability testing interviews where he recommends asking the participant about their:</p><ol><li id="084d">Expectation (about what will happen)</li><li id="4d83">Reaction (to what happens)</li><li id="64e1">Reflection (on the difference between 1 and 2)</li></ol><figure><div></div></figure><p id="ec98">A less scientific and more agile approach to identifying lower-hanging usability issues is concierge onboarding. In concierge onboarding, someone from your team guides — via video call is best — new users through setting up the product and answers the questions in real-time. Concierge onboarding helps the team member understand the steps users are asked to take and the ways those steps directly lead to value.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="2293">In a recent Zoom call with Behzod, he told me how at Slack it was essential to turn usability interviews into video highlights of moments of user struggle to help his team form a shared understanding of the problem and gain alignment around solutions that will actually work.</p><p id="5379">The best product teams never stop this work of generative and evaluative testing for new features. Even as their initial research and testing turns into a real product, they know the importance of creating a customer discovery and product delivery engine that never stops learning and growing.</p><p id="b7d9">It’s much more common for product teams to continually learn and discover from their existing users than it is for them to gather insights from completely unbiased non-users. But a balance between the two groups — existing and new — is ideal. New users can give you a better understanding of your initial product experience, and existing “power users” can offer you insights that come from living with a product for weeks or months.</p><p id="1af9">Great product teams develop long-standing relationships of trust with their most active users. You’ll often see the people on these teams setting up recurring feedback sessions to gain insight and listen to users’ concerns and ideas. The point of these interviews is to find out what’s delightful and what’s frustrating, what’s there and working well, and …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Today we are happy to announce a new, powerful <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://opennebula.io/true-hybrid/" target="_blank">True Hybrid Cloud Architecture</a> for OpenNebula. This reference architecture is composed of hybrid clusters that can run <strong>any workload</strong>, both virtualized and containerized, on <strong>any resource</strong>, physical or virtual, <strong>anywhere</strong>, on-premises and on the cloud.</p>



<p>Our <strong>True Hybrid Cloud Architecture</strong> implements enterprise-grade features for performance, availability and scalability with <strong>a very simple design</strong> that enables workload portability across geographic distributed clusters, <strong>avoids vendor lock-in</strong> and reduces complexity, resource consumption and operational costs across the board.</p>







<div><figure><img src="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Consolidated-Infra-Cluster.png" alt="" width="661" height="398"></figure></div>







<p>Now more than ever, IT departments need the right blend of on-premises, public and edge cloud environments to support the collection of existing and emerging use cases. They also need to <strong>combine virtual machine workloads with application containers in a shared environment</strong> that can offer the best of both worlds—mature virtualization technology and secure container orchestration.</p>



<p>Over a decade’s worth of experience working with hundreds of users and customers has helped us define a <strong>True Hybrid Cloud Architecture</strong> that is much simpler than the traditional cloud computing architectures made of complex, proprietary general-purpose software systems for storage and networking. This one builds upon storage and networking technologies that already exist in the Linux operating system and modern storage hardware that are available from existing cloud and edge providers, leading to a greatly simplified design.</p>



<p>The <strong>True Hybrid Cloud Architecture</strong> will be the recommended and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://opennebula.io/true-hybrid/" target="_blank">commercially supported cloud configuration</a> for hybrid and edge computing with OpenNebula. While support for this architecture won’t be available to the general public until the next version of OpenNebula (due in January 2021), in the following days we are announcing the delivery of cloud deployment services, enterprise support and managed services for <strong>OpenNebula 5.12 </strong>clouds<strong> </strong>based on this innovative architecture. You can enjoy a <strong>single vendor experience</strong> with a <strong>complete cloud stack fully supported and managed by OpenNebula Systems</strong>. This ultimately affords a simplified experience for procurement, consulting, support and management.</p>

                  There are different reasons why this has happened, but one of the main reasons is that the way we work hasn't really changed. When companies started shifting their workforce to a remote model, they took the tools they were already using (e.g. Slack, Zoom) and sent their employees home.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These tools are now being used in the same way they were used in the office, where most of the interaction happened in real-time.

                  A quick chat is now another Zoom meeting in a long succession of meetings and a tap on the shoulder is yet another Slack message that pulls you away from what you were doing.
                  This firehose of messages and meetings is not sustainable as it leads to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/28/remote-work-burnout-is-growing-as-coronavirus-pandemic-stretches-on.html">anxiety</a>, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90554935/the-red-flag-signs-you-may-be-burning-out-while-working-from-home">burnout</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2020/09/06/how-remote-workers-can-recognize-burnout-and-6-actions-to-take/?sh=64da6cf14326">pressure</a> to always be connected.

Most people agree that whatever happens, companies will be way more distributed than they were before the pandemic.
                  One thing is for sure -- the communication &amp; collaboration tools that exist today just don't cut it.

                  <b>This is where <a href="http://rock.so/">Rock</a> comes in</b>. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/liming/">Ming</a> and I started building Rock about a year ago to make it easier to shift towards a <a href="http://rock.so/about">more asynchronous way of working</a>. This way of working gives you <b>more control</b> over your workday, makes you <b>more productive</b> while <b>reserving face-to-face meetings</b> for the most important things. It's also ideally suited to a workforce that is more distributed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the right tools and mindset, working with your team becomes more like a <b>relay race</b>. Everybody knows what's going on, you can pick things up when you're ready, and work happens in a state of flow.
                </p>

              <div>
                <p>
                  Rock combines real-time messaging and video calls with more asynchronous ways of communicating like <a href="http://rock.so/tasks">tasks</a>, <a href="http://rock.so/notes">notes</a>, and <a href="http://rock.so/files">files</a> and makes this available in <a href="http://rock.so/product">one space</a>. Because we combine these different types of communication, we make it easy for you to pick and choose the best way to interact with your team. We also work with Google Drive (and will work with Zoom and others soon) so it's easier to tap into your existing workflows.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When you <a href="http://rock.so/better-than-slack">compare Rock to Slack</a> you can easily see why we think Rock just works better for how work happens today.

                  It's our mission to <b>build tools to empower anyone to work from anywhere</b>. When this happens - companies are more diverse, job opportunities are not limited by location and we all meet less, while doing more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We have a lot more to say and lots more to build.

<hr>
<p>PTM is a Windows 10 C++ library that allows a programmer to manipulate all memory, physical, and virtual from user-mode. The project inherits an interface from VDM allowing the use of a physical memory read-write primitive to fuel this project. VDM is used solely to configure the page tables in such a way that PTM can manage them from user-mode. Once the page tables are configured for PTM VDM is no longer required. However, VDM can inherit an instance of PTM as a means to read and write physical memory. Both VDM and PTM work extremely well together and independently from each other.</p>

<hr>
<p>Page table manipulation is an extremely powerful primitive. One that allows groundbreaking projects to be created such as patching the kernel only in specific process-contexts, or mapping of a source process address space into a target process address space. PTM is a user-mode library that allows a programmer to manipulate page tables from user-mode on 64-bit Windows 10 systems. PTM does this by using VDM; a project designed to abuse vulnerable drivers exposing a physical memory read-write primitive (RWP) to elevate to arbitrary kernel execution. VDM is used to configure the page tables in such a way that they can be managed from user-mode without the need for VDM’s vulnerable driver being loaded into the kernel after initialization. PTM can then be used to get and set all levels of page table entries, translation linear virtual addresses from user-mode, map physical memory into virtual memory, and even create new page tables. PTM can also be used as a means to directly read and write physical memory, thus it can be used with VDM to leverage arbitrary kernel execution without the need of VDM’s vulnerable driver being loaded into the kernel.</p>

<hr>
<p>Paging is the concept of breaking memory into fixed-sized chunks called pages. Pages can be moved in and out of physical memory allowing for memory that is not accessed frequently to be moved to disk. In order for this to work, the CPU cannot directly interface with physical memory instead the CPU interfaces with virtual memory. Virtual addresses are translated to physical addresses using a set of tables called page tables. On a 64-bit system with the CPU in long mode, there are four layers of page tables: PML4(s), PDPT(s), PD(s), and lastly PT(s). All page tables are the same size (1000h bytes) unless configured otherwise. Each page table entry is eight bytes in size. This means that each table contains 512 entries (8 * 512 = 1000h). The last twelve bits of every virtual address is called the page offset and is an offset into a physical page. The page offset of a virtual address can be bigger than 12 bits depending on the paging structure configuration for a given virtual address. The length of the page offset field can be either 12 bits (physical page is 4kB), 21 bits (2MB physical page), or 30 bits (1GB page).</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/IqB4B22.png"></p><p>In order to translate linear virtual addresses to linear physical addresses, the page tables must be traversed. As depicted in figure one, each virtual address space has its own PML4, the physical address of this table is stored in CR3.</p>

<hr>
<p>On Windows, the thread scheduler utilizes KPROCESS.DirectoryTableBase when scheduling threads. The KPROCESS structure is a substructure of the EPROCESS structure and contains DirectoryTableBase at offset 28h. A programmer using VDM can obtain the linear physical address of the PML4 of a process easily by DKOM’ing a desired process KPROCESS structure.</p>
<pre><code>kd&gt; dt !_KPROCESS ffffc38759d9e080
nt!_KPROCESS
   +0x000 Header           : _DISPATCHER_HEADER
   +0x018 ProfileListHead  : _LIST_ENTRY 
   +0x028 DirectoryTableBase : 0x00000001`15684000
   +0x030 ThreadListHead   : _LIST_ENTRY 
   +0x040 ProcessLock      : 0
   +0x044 ProcessTimerDelay : 0
   +0x048 DeepFreezeStartTime : 0
</code></pre><p>Once the physical address of the desired processes PML4 has been obtained the trick is interfacing with the paging structures. Although VDM allows reading and writing of physical memory, be aware that MmMapIoSpace cannot be used to map the paging structures into virtual memory. Drivers that use MmCopyMemory and ZwMapViewOfSection to interface with physical memory can however be used to directly manipulate the page tables. To properly support VDM which PTM inherits as a codebase, the project does not rely on the physical read and write primitive exposed from the driver. Instead PTM allocates its own set of page tables and inserts a PML4E into the current processes PML4 pointing at such tables. This allows a programmer to map physical memory at will into the current virtual memory address space, all from user-mode. In other words, once the tables are allocated and configured, there is no need for VDM anymore since the paging tables can be controlled entirely from user-mode.</p>

<hr>
<p>The translation look-aside buffer is a hardware-based cache that assists in translating linear virtual addresses to linear physical addresses. The TLB caches virtual to physical address translations, as well as other information like page access rights and cache type information. Although extremely important for efficiency, the TLB has made PTM an interesting challenge. For example, when physical memory is mapped into a virtual address space, page table entries will be inserted, or changed. This insertion or alteration of an existing page table entry may be of a cached entry in the TLB. This means that the effects applied to the page table entry will not be seen until the TLB entry for the given virtual page has been invalidated, along with the changes written to main memory. To counteract this, the CPU has an instruction that allows a programmer to invalidate a page table entry in the TLB’s cache. This instruction is called INVLPG and is a privileged instruction. It’s not something PTM can use since the library is designed to operate entirely from user-mode. Directly invalidating TLB is not the only way to invalidate entries. If a page fault occurs, the TLB invalidates entries for the given address that caused the fault (the address in CR2). This is an effective method for invalidating desired virtual addresses from user-mode but is extremely slow. Context switches do not inherently cause the TLB to flush, rather the PCID is changed to another PCID. This allows the TLB to retain entries from multiple address spaces and improve performance. However, yielding execution can invalidate TLB entries because the scheduler will reschedule the logical processor to execute somewhere else for some time, possibly filling the TLB with other entries and removing the ones that were previously cached.</p>

<hr>
<p>Although the TLB is an effective hardware-based cache, it cannot cache linear virtual addresses that have not been accessed before, this simple fact means a programmer can create a new linear virtual address every single time they would want to map a new physical page into virtual memory. This, however, is not a solid solution that works soundly on all modern CPUs. With the industry pushing forward with virtualization technology, the expansion of the TLB continues. Thus solely generating a new linear virtual address every time you would want to interface with a physical page is not a sound solution and is already unstable on most modern AMD chips. Instead combining this technique with other techniques is ideal.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>auto</span> ptm_ctx<span>::</span>map_page(<span>void</span><span>*</span> addr) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>void</span><span>*</span>
{
	<span>++</span>pte_index;
	<span>if</span> (pte_index <span>&gt;</span> <span>511</span>)
	{
		<span>++</span>pde_index;
		pte_index <span>=</span> <span>0</span>;
	}

	<span>if</span> (pde_index <span>&gt;</span> <span>511</span>)
	{
		<span>++</span>pdpte_index;

	}

	<span>if</span> (pdpte_index <span>&gt;</span> <span>511</span>)
		pdpte_index <span>=</span> <span>0</span>;

	<span>// insert paging table entries down here…
</span><span></span>	<span>//... (refer to PTM repo to see that code)...
</span><span></span>	<span>// returns the newly generated virtual address...
</span><span></span>	<span>return</span> <span>get_virtual_address</span>();
}
</code></pre></div><p>The code above generates a new linear virtual address that has not been accessed before. This linear virtual address points to the requests physical page in memory. This allows the programmer to circumvent the TLB by accessing new linear virtual addresses instead of trying to invalidate TLB entry of an existed and already cached page. This however has limitations since the code only provides 512^3 different possible virtual pages.</p>
<h3 id="tlb_benefit_of_the_doubt"><a href="#tlb_benefit_of_the_doubt">TLB - Benefit of The Doubt</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>Although outrunning the TLB is the fastest solution for mapping physical memory into virtual memory without needing to invalidate any TLB entries, it is not the most stable on modern hardware. Instead, a mixture of generating a new virtual address and an SEH try/except loop is preferred. By giving the new virtual address the benefit of the doubt that it has not been cached yet, an attempt to access the newly created page is performed. If the access is successful, the new linear virtual address is returned to the caller of ptm::ptm_ctx::map_page. However, if the access causes a page fault, the TLB invalidates the entries associated with this newly created linear virtual address. The except block then attempts to access the new page in a loop whilst yielding execution at each failure to access the new virtual address. This technique provides the most performant solution to dealing with the TLB from user-mode. This method guarantees that the linear virtual address generated is accessible before returning it to the caller.</p>

  <p>Making it easy for users to destroy their work in a single click violates one of the most basic usability principles, which is to respect and protect the user’s work at almost any cost.<br>
—<cite><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/top-10-application-design-mistakes-2008/?lm=top-10-application-design-mistakes&amp;pt=article">Top 10 Application-Design Mistakes of 2008. Nielsen Norman Group.</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mistakes happen. Discarding a user’s form data when he or she attempts to navigate away from the page—perhaps accidentally—can lead to frustrated users, lower form response rates, and abandoned carts.</p>

<p>Many web forms prompt for confirmation before accepting requests to navigate away from the form. These warnings improve the application’s user experience. Unfortunately, they are not trivial to implement. Single-page applications, in particular, must handle navigation within the application as well as external navigation.</p>

<p>This article implements a web form navigation confirmation using TypeScript and React. Traditional web applications are covered first. This solution is then extended to work for single-page applications.</p>
      <h2 id="preventing-form-data-loss-in-traditional-multi-page-web-applications">
        
        
          Preventing form data loss in traditional multi-page web applications <a href="#preventing-form-data-loss-in-traditional-multi-page-web-applications">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>In a traditional web application, users interact with the server by requesting and receiving wholly-formed HTML documents. The user may request and receive other resources such as images or JavaScript files, but each discrete interaction between client and server will result in an HTML document that can be processed and rendered by the browser.</p>

<p>This model of navigation is relatively straightforward:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Resources are offered to the user via URLs.</li>
  <li>Navigating to a new URL will unload the current document and replace it with a new document from the server.</li>
  <li>The current document’s URL can be tracked by the browser and displayed to the user via the address bar.</li>
</ul>
    
      <h3 id="dom-events">
        
        
          DOM events <a href="#dom-events">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Requesting and rendering documents from the server is not the only function of the web browser. Even though client/server interactions result in the loading of a new page in traditional web applications, client-side scripting is still often employed to improve the UI/UX associated with displaying the server’s data or facilitating the user’s next request.</p>

<p>Modern browsers allow client-side scripts to track and react to many actions that occur within the context of the web page via DOM events. Common examples include reacting to user mouse clicks or keypresses, but DOM events also exist for actions handled by the browser itself such as loading or unloading a document, monitoring the user’s connection, etc. As of November 2020, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events">MDN</a> lists 191 events in the “Standard” category representing events defined in official Web specifications which should be supported by standards-compliant browsers.</p>
    
      <h3 id="the-beforeunload-event">
        
        
          The beforeunload event <a href="#the-beforeunload-event">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>The <code>beforeunload</code> event is particularly useful for preventing form data loss. As the name would imply, this event is fired before the current page is unloaded. It prompts the user, who is then able to cancel or confirm the navigation.</p>

<p>At first glance, this is a perfect solution. An event handler can be implemented that checks if the user has provided input. If so, it can prompt for confirmation before unloading the page. However, there are a few caveats.</p>

<p>Most DOM event handlers are flexible. With the right JavaScript, clicking a button could submit a form, change the background image, or navigate to an entirely different page. The <code>beforeunload</code> event is much more restrictive. While a developer <em>could</em> place arbitrary code within the handler, the user will be given a generic confirmation box regardless of the additional code.</p>

<p>This is for good reason! One could imagine a nefarious developer blocking all attempts to navigate away from a page if the event allowed more flexibility.</p>

<p>Earlier browsers limited the outcome to a dialog box but allowed custom text within that dialog. Even this presents a risk. The aforementioned developer could place misleading or annoying text in the confirmation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your account is currently being upgraded. Navigating away from the site before the upgrade is finished could permanently disable your access! Click “OK” to risk breaking your account.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It looks like you are leaving. Our service is best in class, so this must be a mistake!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A particularly devious developer could even word the confirmation so that the user believes that the confirm/cancel operations are inverted, leading the user to cancel the navigation despite wanting to proceed.</p>

<p>The browser may even choose not to display the confirmation dialog at all, particularly if the user does not appear to have interacted with the page. This bias to conservatism is specifically encouraged by the HTML standard.<sup><a href="#footnotes">1</a></sup></p>

<p>As a final word of caution, setting this event listener currently renders the page “unsalvageable” meaning that it will likely not be reused if the user navigates back during the same session. <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/5889">This may be changing soon</a> and is likely not a meaningful concern for most applications.</p>

<p>Despite these minor inconveniences to the developer, <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=beforeunload">the event is widely supported</a>, and the restrictions likely make the web a much more user-friendly place than it would be without them.</p>
    
      <h3 id="browser-support">
        
        
          Browser support <a href="#browser-support">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Although the event has broad browser support, there are minor differences in the interface it exposes. <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-beforeunloadevent-interface">According to the specification</a>, invoking the event’s <code>preventDefault</code> method is both necessary and sufficient to indicate that the page desires to show a confirmation. Most browsers <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_window_beforeunload_event_preventdefault_activation">choose to ignore this guideline</a>. Alternative approaches include <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_window_beforeunload_event_return_string_activation">returning a string</a> and assigning a string <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_window_beforeunload_event_event_returnvalue_activation">to the event’s <code>returnValue</code> property</a>. As a practical matter, it is best to implement all three approaches to improve browser coverage.</p>

          Implementing the <code>useUnloadConfirmation</code> hook <a href="#implementing-the-useunloadconfirmation-hook">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Having made it through all the background, we can finally implement the hook.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>useEffect</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'</span><span>react</span><span>'</span>

<span>const</span> <span>handleEvent</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>e</span><span>:</span> <span>BeforeUnloadEvent</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>e</span><span>.</span><span>preventDefault</span><span>()</span>

    <span>// This custom message will only be used in older browsers</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>message</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>Your changes may not be saved.</span><span>"</span>

    <span>e</span><span>.</span><span>returnValue</span> <span>=</span> <span>message</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>message</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>useUnloadConfirmation</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>shouldPrompt</span><span>:</span> <span>boolean</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>eventName</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>beforeunload</span><span>'</span>
    <span>useEffect</span><span>(()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>shouldPrompt</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>eventName</span><span>,</span> <span>handleEvent</span><span>)</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>removeEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>eventName</span><span>,</span> <span>handleEvent</span><span>)</span>
            <span>}</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>},</span> <span>[</span><span>shouldPrompt</span><span>])</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>useUnloadConfirmation</code> hook accepts a single parameter indicating if the confirmation should be shown on navigation. This parameter will typically represent whether the form is “dirty” or not. The hook runs an internal <code>useEffect</code> whenever the value of <code>shouldPrompt</code> changes. This <code>useEffect</code> hook adds a handler that runs on <code>beforeunload</code> events. It returns a clean-up function that removes the listener when <code>useEffect</code> runs next or the component unmounts.</p>

<p>Consuming the custom hook is as simple as adding a line to each relevant form component.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>formIsDirty</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>FormLibraryOfChoice</span><span>()</span>
<span>useUnloadConfirmation</span><span>(</span><span>formIsDirty</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
    
      <h2 id="single-page-application-navigation">
        
        
          Single-page application navigation <a href="#single-page-application-navigation">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>The <code>useUnloadConfirmation</code> hook provides a lot of functionality in a small amount of code, but it makes an important assumption: navigation that could cause data loss is preceded by a page unload event.</p>

<p>This assumption tends to hold for traditional web applications. Single-page applications (SPAs), however, were created specifically to violate this assumption.</p>

<p>SPAs create the illusion of navigation—changing the URL and title, displaying new content, etc.—without prompting the page to reload. Without an <code>unload</code> event ever firing, it should be fairly obvious that <code>useUnloadConfirmation</code> will not be effective.</p>

<p>Instead of loading separate HTML documents to retrieve and display content, SPAs load an initial document which is then incrementally updated using client-side scripting combined with AJAX requests. “Navigation” within this single, ever-evolving document is typically handled via the History API.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://innolitics.com/img/articles/spa-navigation.svg" alt="Common browser elements and their method of navigation in single-page applications">
    <figcaption>Figure 1: In a single-page application, navigation can occur via a page unload/load cycle or the History API.</figcaption>
</figure>
    
      <h3 id="the-history-api">
        
        
          The History API <a href="#the-history-api">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Web browsers keep an ongoing list of addresses visited by the user during the current session. This list allows users to traverse their browsing history using the browser’s “back” and “forward” buttons.</p>

<p>The History API provides a mechanism to view and mutate this list (with restrictions). As a simple example, an SPA could implement a navigation bar with several “links.” Clicking these links does not navigate to a separate document. Instead, it fires a <code>click</code> DOM event which notifies the page’s JavaScript to display new content and uses the History API to modify the URL shown in the address bar.</p>
    
      <h3 id="conditionally-blocking-spa-navigation">
        
        
          Conditionally blocking SPA navigation <a href="#conditionally-blocking-spa-navigation">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Since any calls to the History API are handled by the page’s JavaScript, which also typically handles determining when navigation should be blocked, there is a conceptually straightforward approach to preventing form data loss: wrap all calls to the History API in code that checks if the page has indicated navigation should be blocked.</p>
    
      <h3 id="a-react-router-example">
        
        
          A React Router example <a href="#a-react-router-example">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Many developers will use a specialized library to handle SPA navigation rather than working directly with the History API. The examples below use React Router and, specifically, its <code>history</code> package. Fortunately, <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/history/issues/690#issuecomment-477203090">there are many similarities</a> between <code>history</code> …</p></div></div></div>

    <div>
        <p><em>Metaprogramming</em> is a scary word: it sounds like voodoo for programmers, and in some manners it is. It is used by most popular Elixir libraries (Ecto, Phoenix and Elixir itself) and as I leveled up as an Elixir programmer, I needed to understand how it worked under the hood. </p><p>I personally felt intimidated by the topic, and I owned the <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/cmelixir/metaprogramming-elixir/"><em>Metaprogramming Elixir</em> book</a> for more than a year before actually reading it 😱</p><figure><img src="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2020/11/elixir-books.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/elixir-books.jpg 600w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/elixir-books.jpg 1000w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2020/11/elixir-books.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>My Elixir personal library&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>But for any seasoned Elixir programmer, it is an excellent handbook and very pleasant to read. It is also pragmatic and I concur 100% with Chris McCord’s introductory advice:</p><blockquote>Rule 1 : Don't Write Macros - Chris McCord</blockquote><p>Be cautious with <em>metaprogramming</em> as it is hardly maintainable and a pain to debug; don't even think about writing your application core features with it. It is more relevant for technical libraries, custom DSL and any other specific subjects.</p><h2 id="it-s-a-kind-of-magic">It's a kind of magic</h2><p>As many of you, I came from a Ruby on Rails development background and I remember that while learning Rails, I was so impressed by the language expressivity and its magic features. Coming then from a Java background, it was a blessing to me!</p><figure><pre><code>irb&gt; 2.years.from_now + 5.days.from_now

The compiler will parse your code and turn it into an AST, then the BEAM will evaluate the AST in order to run it.</p><figure><img src="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2020/11/Untitled-2020-11-20-0920.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Untitled-2020-11-20-0920.png 600w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Untitled-2020-11-20-0920.png 1000w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Untitled-2020-11-20-0920.png 1600w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2020/11/Untitled-2020-11-20-0920.png 1938w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)</figcaption></figure><p><em>Metaprogramming</em>, which we previously defined as « code to generate code » could be achieved by generating raw Elixir code (as strings) but it would be unefficient and hardly maintainable. </p><p>That’s why Elixir provides API’s to generate and evaluate AST. Here comes <code>quote</code>: an Elixir primitive which can convert any Elixir code into its AST.</p><pre><code>iex(1)&gt; quote do 5 + 8 * 3 end
#=&gt; {:+, [context: Elixir, import: Kernel],
#=&gt;   [5, {:*, 
#=&gt;     [context: Elixir, import: Kernel], 
#=&gt;     [8, 3]
#=&gt;   ]}]
#=&gt; }</code></pre><p>This code can be evaluated the same way you would have evaluated code in a string (think <code>eval</code> in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval">Javascript</a>)</p><pre><code>iex(1)&gt; Code.eval_string("5 + 8 * 3")
#=&gt; {29, []}
iex(2)&gt; Code.eval_quoted(quote do 5 + 8 * 3 end)
#=&gt; {29, []}</code></pre><p>Now what happens if you try to evaluate code with dynamic parts? </p><pre><code>iex(1)&gt; a = 5
iex(2)&gt; Code.eval_string("3 * a")
#=&gt; ** (CompileError) nofile:1: undefined function a/0</code></pre><p>Of course <code>a</code> is unknown to your evaluated code and a simple way to fix this would be to use text interpolation.</p><pre><code>iex(1)&gt; a = 5
iex(2)&gt; Code.eval_string("3 * #{a}")
#=&gt; {15, []}</code></pre><p>Well the good news is you can interpolate within your quoted code as well: use the <code>unquote</code> primitive.</p><pre><code>iex(1)&gt; a = 5
iex(2)&gt; Code.eval_quoted(quote do 3 * unquote(a) end)
#=&gt; {15, []}</code></pre><p>Simple as that! So whenever you think you are lost between your <code>quote</code> / <code>unquote</code> blocks, just look at it as if it were text interpolation. </p><p>Then you need to know about <code>defmacro</code> which you probably already encountered in your Phoenix project. It's a special construct able to produce code, from quoted expressions and parameters.</p><p>Here is an example that generates a few functions :</p><pre><code>defmodule MyMacro do
  defmacro generate_functions(name_and_values) do
    for {name, value} &lt;- name_and_values do
      quote do
        def unquote(name)(), do: unquote(value)
      end
    end
  end
end

defmodule MyModule do
  require MyMacro
  
  MyMacro.generate_functions([{:one, 1}, {:two, 2}, {:three, 3}])
end

iex(1)&gt; MyModule.two + MyModule.three 
#=&gt; 5</code></pre><p>There are quite a few other things to know when it comes to Elixir <em>metaprogramming</em>, but <code>quote</code>, <code>unquote</code> and <code>defmacro</code> are the basics and can already help you to build powerful stuff.</p><h2 id="ok-but-what-for">Ok, but what for?</h2><p>I will end this post with some examples of the way we use <em>metaprogramming</em> in our Elixir projects.</p><h3 id="extends-ecto-query-api">Extends Ecto query API</h3><p>Ecto provides a fully featured querying API that mimics SQL. It relies on Elixir Macros and will be able to trigger compilation errors whenever your query is malformed.</p><figure><pre><code>iex(1)&gt; query = from u in User, where: u.age &gt; 0, select: u.name
iex(2)&gt; Repo.all(query)</code></pre><figcaption>Typical Ecto query</figcaption></figure><p>But every now and then you'll want to use some specific database functions not available in Ecto API. You can then use <code>fragment</code> Ecto function which let you insert raw SQL in your Ecto Query:</p><figure><pre><code>query = 
  from u in User,
  where: is_nil(fragment("?-&gt;&gt;?", u.metadata, "phone"))</code></pre><figcaption>Using fragment to access a field within a Postgres JSONB column</figcaption></figure><p>But the proper way is to leverage on macros to extend the Ecto query API:</p><figure><pre><code>defmodule MyQueryMacros do
  defmacro jsonb_get(column, key) do
    quote do
      fragment("?-&gt;&gt;?", unquote(column), unquote(key))
    end
  end
 end
 
 query = 
   from u in User,
   where: is_nil(jsonb_get(u.metadata, "phone"))</code></pre><figcaption>Same Ecto query using our homemade jsonb_get macro</figcaption></figure><h3 id="aliases-imports">Aliases &amp; Imports</h3><p>As your Elixir codebase grows, you can see that you repeat over and over the same <code>alias</code> and <code>import</code> blocks at the head of your files. Not really <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>...</p><p>Phoenix already offers a solution you can use through the <code>use</code> / <code>__using__</code> macro. To declare a <em>controller</em> or a <em>view, </em>phoenix suggests a bunch of default aliases and imports declared in <code>my_app_web.ex</code> file. Here is an example of <a href="https://changelog.com/">changelog.com</a> <code>*_web.ex</code> file :</p><figure><a href="https://github.com/thechangelog/changelog.com/blob/master/lib/changelog_web.ex"><div><p>thechangelog/changelog.com</p><p>Hacker to the 💚.

  use MyAppWeb, :controller
  
  # ...
end</code></pre><p>In our own project, we also brewed our own <em>aliasing</em> system that we can use like this to prevent us from declaring the same aliases over and over.</p><pre><code>defmodule MyApp.Contracts.SomeContractService do
  use MyApp,
    aliases: [:campaigns, :contracts, :users],
    private_aliases: [:contracts]
    
  # ...
end   </code></pre><p>I may write further about these specific macros in another post 😉</p><h3 id="changix">changix</h3><p>A final example of how we use macros in our main Elixir application is our <strong>application changelog</strong>. We present new features, bug fixes and improvement to our users with a changelog sidebar (and a blinking badge to draw their attention).</p><figure><img src="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2020/11/changelog.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/changelog.jpg 600w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/changelog.jpg 1000w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2020/11/changelog.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A changelog sidebar embedded in our webapp</figcaption></figure><p>Instead of feeding this changelog from database, we use <em>markdown</em> files with a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/">YAML front matter</a> header.</p><figure><img src="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2020/11/markdown.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/markdown.jpg 600w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/markdown.jpg 1000w, https://www.christianblavier.com/content/images/2020/11/markdown.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Our markdown changelog files, commited right along source code</figcaption></figure><p>At first, we used to parse these files at runtime everytime a user triggered the sidebar, then we cached the HTML output in memory in order to improve performance.</p><p>But after reading Chris McCord's book, we realized that these <em>markdown</em> files could be considered as source code and be compiled as well (or at least processed at compile-time). Here comes <a href="https://github.com/cblavier/changix"><strong>changix</strong></a>: a library relying on macros to provide compile-time changelog features. </p><figure><a href="https://github.com/cblavier/changix"><div><p>cblavier/changix</p><p>Compile-time changelog features for Elixir.

However, that war will (hopefully!) be slow and boring, with countries prioritizing directed energy and electronic attacks on satellites over kinetic ones so as to avoid creating debris that would deny space access as much to themselves as others. <a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/07/23/u-s-officials-say-russia-tested-a-new-anti-satellite-weapon/" target="_blank">Russia</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-satellite_weapon#United_States_ASATs" target="_blank">US</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Chinese_anti-satellite_missile_test" target="_blank">China</a>, &amp; <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/15/india-s-asat-test-incomplete-success-pub-78884" target="_blank">India</a> all have direct ascent anti-satellite weapons (with the latter three countries having spread space debris during ill-conceived weapons tests), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_3#:~:text=Arrow%203%20may%20serve%20as%20an%20anti-satellite%20weapon" target="_blank">Israel may as well</a>. At least the US and Russia also have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335506/russia-anti-satellite-weapon-test-kosmos-2543" target="_blank">anti-satellite satellites</a> that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21117224/russian-satellite-us-spy-kosmos-2542-45-inspection-orbit-tracking" target="_blank">maneuver around</a> and muck with other satellites in undefined ways. These countries also likely have ground and satellite-based jammers and lasers (both dazzling and destructive). Satellites are very hard to defend because they have predictable orbits and very limited maneuvering budgets, so instead of having a few <a href="https://spacenews.com/the-end-of-sbirs-air-force-says-its-time-to-move-on/" target="_blank">exquisite satellites as the US military does now</a>, the US DOD is following (and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21503165/spacex-space-development-agency-contract-missile-warning-satellites-starlink" target="_blank">employing</a>) the NewSpace industry toward a proliferation of small, disposable satellites. Related: A <a href="https://aerospace.org/sites/default/files/2020-10/Reesman_PhysicsWarSpace_20201001.pdf" target="_blank">PDF entitled “The physics of space war: how orbital dynamics constrain space-to-space engagements”</a> from Aerospace Corp. talks about how the limited ∆v budgets of space vehicles limits warfare and makes planning and timing essential to an attack.

Orbital Mechanics has been around since well before artificial satellites were even remotely possible—for example, Walter Hohmann discovered his eponymous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit" target="_blank">transfer orbit</a> in 1929. This simple transfer maneuver consists of two velocity changes, the first to elongate an orbital ellipse so that it intersects a target apogee and a second to circularize the ellipse (<a href="https://youtu.be/aKXNbf6NCKU" target="_blank">video explainer</a> 📺). Orbital plane changes, avoided whenever possible due to high energy cost, are completed by normal acceleration at the point around which the orbital plane should pivot. Meanwhile, rendezvous between two craft in different orbits often requires the application of multiple maneuvers (see <a href="https://www.spaceflightinsider.com/missions/human-spaceflight/breakdown-of-crew-1-flight-plan-an-inside-look/" target="_blank">Crew-1's flight plan</a>). Timing an orbital transfer is key, as the maneuvering spacecraft must give the target the correct lead time or it will end up&nbsp;in front or behind. Rendezvousing with another object in the same orbit is perhaps the most counterintuitive, as you must adjust your orbital period by leaving the shared orbit and later re-entering it. To "slow down" you accelerate to increase the height of your orbit, lengthening your orbital period relative to the other craft, let time pass, and then re-enter the original orbit once they've caught up. Conversely, to catch up, you decrease velocity to achieve a smaller, more eccentric orbit, which has a shorter orbital period. There are tons of resources out there for diving into the math of orbital mechanics (and related concepts like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect" target="_blank">Oberth effect</a> and Sun-synchronous orbits that are only possible because of torque from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_bulge" target="_blank">Earth’s equatorial bulge</a>). Surprisingly, an easy read comes from the FAA's Office of Aerospace Medicine <a href="https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/cami/library/online_libraries/aerospace_medicine/tutorial/section3/spacecraft_design/" target="_blank">as part of their "Advanced Aerospace Medicine On-line" course</a> (we're not sure how Hohmann transfers relate to patching up wounded astronauts). You can also <a href="https://orbitalmechanics.info/" target="_blank">play with orbits in a simulator</a>, but we generally recommend <a href="https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/" target="_blank">Kerbal Space Program</a> if you really want to develop a more intuitive sense of two-body orbital mechanics while having a blast (pun very much intended). Sadly, KSP 2, the much-anticipated sequel with multiplayer support, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/11/5/21551754/kerbal-space-program-2-release-date-delayed-2022" target="_blank">has now slipped to a 2022 release</a>.</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div> <strong>Papers</strong><ul><li> <a href="https://earthsky.org/space/is-it-true-that-jupiter-protects-earth" target="_blank">Jupiter may protect us from asteroids</a>, but it also likely prevented us from having siblings—had the solar system not had a gas giant, we might have up to 6 planets in our habitable zone (<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ab9ffe" target="_blank">paper</a>).

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
  
  
  <p><span>02 Dec 2020</span></p><p>A couple of weeks ago, I decided to delete my AirBnB account. I had only used it two times in some years anyway and – while their platform is certainly comfortable to use – I prefer not to externalize my cost of traveling to those who need a place to live in, as I do in my own hometown. Turns out, deleting your account is easier said than done. While I was writing this article, I even found out that I had already tried to delete my account a year ago without success.</p>

<p>So what happened? The account deletion procedure is quite straightforward: You log into your account, after a while you find the form to delete it, verify yourself with a code sent to your phone, and that is it. Some dark patterns trying to make you “deactivate” your account, which pretty much doesn’t do anything at all, but we’re used to that, right?</p>

<p>Except, a while after I did this, I received an email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We understand that you would like to exercise one of your data rights, namely the right of erasure. Airbnb is required to verify that the person making the request is the data subject entitled to the information being requested. […]</p>

  <p>We kindly ask you to send us both of the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A re-statement of your request</li>
    <li>A photocopy of a valid official government ID such as your driver’s license or passport to validate your identity and to facilitate your request</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words: Thanks for your request. How about you ask us again? Further, your email, password, and the code sent to your phone certainly enable you to spend your money here, but our login system is not secure enough to authorize a deletion of your data.</p>

<p>Well, slightly annoyed, I repeated my request, mentioning that I verified three factors (Email+Password/Phone number/Ownership of email) to authorize my request now. The GDPR was on my side, since <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/">Art. 17</a> defines the right to erasure. While <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-12-gdpr/">Art. 12(6)</a> reads “[…] where the controller has reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request referred to in Articles 15 to 21, the controller may request the provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject.”, I don’t see any way in which my identity could have been reasonably doubted at this point.</p>

<p>Long story short, what followed was 10 more emails full of customer service bullshit, a mail to the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), and finally, three weeks after my initial request – and without me uploading my passport:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We understand that you would like to delete all of your personal data. Please understand that this means that we will no longer be able to provide our services to you.</p>

  <p>As you have provided us with sufficient information to prove your identity, we’ve started to review your request.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a boring adventure! Well, aside from AirBnB not giving a damn about our funny European GDPR, I wondered the most about the DPC’s answer, that, while generally helpful, included the following paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please also note that the Data Protection Commission (the “DPC”) acts as an
independent regulator, and is therefore not in a position to approve or
otherwise any specific data processing operations as this could prejudice
the investigation of any future complaints. We are an independent office
whose primary function is to give general guidance to members of the public
regarding data protection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be clear: The responsible party for all AirBnB’s non-payment activity in Europe, where I live, is <em>Airbnb Ireland UC</em><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>,
which makes the <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/">Irish DPC</a> the responsible agency to send complaints to. This agency tells you that it won’t actually interfere with any data processing operations, since this might influence how future complaints are handled. That’s exactly what I thought was part of their job: Giving out fines to companies, thereby further clarifying the GDPR’s application. Or is the Irish DPC more of an outsourced call center for US companies to keep complaining customers busy? It’s not a secret you sometimes <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/10/14/privacy-activist-max-schrems-sues-irish-data-watchdog-letting/">have to sue the DPC</a> to make them do their job. But such a clear confession that they don’t intend to enforce the only law they are supposed to deal with is bizarre.</p>

<p>In the European Union, we have a traditional race to the bottom, in which Luxembourg, failing to contribute economic value, makes its money by being an <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100115/why-luxembourg-considered-tax-haven.asp">inner-European tax haven</a>. In the same way Luxembourg welcomes companies that don’t intend to pay taxes, Ireland openly advertises for companies who don’t want to be bothered by the GDPR. I told you that AirBnB is based in Ireland? Guess, where AirBnB based their <a href="https://blog.derhagen.eu/assets/airbnb_addresses.png">payment services in Europe</a><sup id="fnref:1:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I was following some interesting discussions about how no one should trust a print screen of a tweet, and it got me thinking regarding how to overcome such a challenge.</p>



<p>What if somehow we could attach a verifiable piece of text (or image QR code) to a tweet that could&nbsp;<strong>quickly disprove</strong>&nbsp;a fake print screen or still optimistically could point that this print&nbsp;<strong>might</strong>&nbsp;be legit.</p>

<p>I thought about using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC" target="_blank">HMAC</a> to solve this problem, where <strong>the secret</strong> is something that only Twitter knows and it’s <strong>tied to each user</strong>. Every tweet must have an SHA 256 signature, <strong>signature = HMAC(user.secret, tweet).</strong></p>



<p>For the sake of UX/UI, this signature can show only its first ten characters, a short hash and it still retains a good number of permutations (16^10).</p>



<p>Now when you see a print screen <strong>claiming</strong> that @someone told “this and that” you can <strong>go to</strong> somewhere like twitter.com/<strong>check</strong> and <strong>type</strong> the username, the message plus its <strong>alleged signature</strong> and verify whether it’s fake or might be legit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sounds good and simple, done:</p>

<p><strong>Of course not</strong>, such an idea needs to be refined and proven to be safe. <strong>I foresee many challenges</strong>, one of them being, let’s say someone is trying to check a print however this person might <strong>not be able to replicate</strong> the images, emojis, special characters or even to match the number of spaces/newlines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For that reason, a kind of allow list filtering out anything else might be in hand. The question is, what characters such a set would hold? The basic Latin character set [a-z, A-Z] is not enough. We have special accent characters in languages such as Portuguese, Spanish and French. And languages such as Hebrew, Japanese, Chinese are best represented by Unicode/UTF-8 characters.</p>



<p>Also, since I’m not a security specialist in any capacity, I don’t know what happens <strong>if the secret remains the same over time</strong> with a ton of tweets and signatures exposed. Is it possible for an observer <strong>to break</strong> this thing?</p>



<p>Well, that’s my silly approach to try to fight the Fake Tweet Print Screen. What do you think? Is it feasible? Is it even necessary to build such a system? Or is it just a plain stupid idea?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today we <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/materialize-raises-40-million-to-simplify-streaming-data-with-sql-and-speed-up-real-time-analytics-301180777.html">announced</a> that we raised a $32M Series B round of funding led by Kleiner Perkins. This follows a $8.5m Series A last year led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, bringing our total funding to-date to a little over $40 million. With our Series B, <a href="https://www.kleinerperkins.com/people/bucky-moore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bucky Moore</a> joins <a href="https://lsvp.com/?team=ravi-mhatre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ravi Mhatre</a> on our board of directors.</p>
<p>At Materialize, we believe that at every business it will soon be essential for all information to be always up-to-date. Whether it’s delivering personalized experiences, accurately identifying fraud, building predictive AI, or discovering new business opportunities, the ability to run complex queries on multiple streams of data and keep their answers up to date is critical to making better decisions about the changing world around us.</p>
<p>While the past decade has seen a groundswell in the adoption of streaming platforms, they are still too difficult to use. Current systems require users to make tradeoffs between dumbing down their queries, waiting for hours-long batch ETL pipelines to finish, or building and orchestrating sprawling microservices. We believe users should not have to make these tradeoffs.</p>
<p>Materialize’s mission is to make queries against streaming data simple. We support industry standard SQL: write queries with multi-way joins, correlated subqueries, and complex aggregations, and we’ll keep the answers always up to date for you. In a world where “real-time” has become an empty buzzword, Materialize provides answers that are up to date within milliseconds. All of this comes in <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/install/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a single binary</a> that is easy to install, easy to use, and easy to deploy. With Materialize, users can get interactive and always-up-to-date answers about their changing data using only their existing SQL skills.</p>
<p>While Materialize is a young company, it is built on top of the award winning Timely Dataflow project, spanning almost a decade of cutting-edge research on stream processing led by my co-founder Frank McSherry. Starting from this solid foundation, $40 million dollars of capital gives us the resources to build the no-compromise streaming database that lets every developer build streaming applications.</p>
<p>With this new round of funding, we are well equipped to deliver on <a href="https://materialize.com/blog-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an ambitious roadmap</a>, including a fully-managed cloud service with tiered storage and replication. We’re also excited to continue work on broadening the suite of SQL tools that we support, as well as investing in a SQL optimizer, performance and benchmarking work, and in making Materialize more resilient and battle-tested. If you’re interested in working on any of these challenges, Materialize <a href="http://materialize.com/careers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is hiring</a> across the board.</p>
<p>And finally, while it is exciting to build Materialize, it has been even more exciting to see how Materialize is being used to build applications that previously would have required months of development, using just a few simple SQL queries. If you’re as excited about Materialize as we are, we’d love for you to get involved. <a href="https://materialize.com/quickstart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download</a> and try Materialize, try <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/katacoda/?intro-wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a demo</a> in your browser, <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/materializecommunity/shared_invite/zt-jjwe1t45-klG9k7V7xibdtqA6bcFpyQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">join the community</a> and say hello, or <a href="http://materialize.com/careers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apply</a> to join our growing team today!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Several years ago when I was working on a big data project, I saw something a data engineer shouldn’t see. Curious to understand the level of detail in a new credit score dataset we’d received in our data lake, I queried it. I was surprised at how easily and suddenly my screen was flooded with the mortgage history, overdraft limits and year-end financial statements of my colleagues, and I felt deeply uneasy. 
</p><p>If I stumbled upon this data, how easy would it be for a malicious user to sell PII (personally identifiable information) data across the dark web? The kind of breach that has since lost trading licenses and slapped several organizations with fines for millions of dollars.</p><p>More recently, contracting at a large global financial services firm, my team encountered constant challenges getting our data projects signed off and into production. The biggest was meeting the maze of data compliance controls. 
</p><p>Asking for special dispensation was getting more difficult in a world of Dodd-Frank, MIFID II and post-financial crash. 
</p><p>Fast forward a few years, the level of regulation has increased, as has the need for engineering teams to continuously access real-time data.
</p><p>We knew that helping organizations meet data compliance for Apache Kafka should be one of our priorities. This would be with the following in mind:
</p><ul><li><p> <b>Responsiveness to real-time needs: </b>The likes of Apache Kafka are powerful Open Source streaming technologies, but we need rules in place to make them useful for business outcomes.</p></li><li><p> <b>
Design for a world of DevOps and DataOps:</b> This means introducing controls in a world of agile data management and data engineering.</p></li><li><p> <b>Flexibility to apply constant regulation updates</b> and change access controls to cover multiple regulatory frameworks, including SEC,<a target="_blank" href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/04/how-you-can-keep-your-real-time-data-operations-on-the-right-side-of-gdpr-apache-kafka/"> GDPR</a>, CCPA, HIPAA etc.
</p></li><li><p> <b>Identifying (and mitigating) data risk:</b> Not all data carries the same impact and level of confidentiality. </p></li><li><p> <b>Passing audits without manual processes:</b> Helping speed up the reporting time of audits.</p></li></ul><p>For us this has been implemented as a Data Policy framework. 
</p><p>The framework is designed to cover data compliance and information security best practices for real-time data. 
</p><p>And although we often talk about protecting PII data, the Data Policies framework helps address data compliance more broadly.  For example, we give visibility over sales transactions whilst masking the order value from internal employees to meet insider trading compliance. 
</p><p>Here we outline the framework and the journey you can take to increase your compliance. </p><h2>Discovery of PII residing in Kafka</h2><p>As your Kafka adoption across teams and projects expands, it’s easy for data sources to proliferate. And to find yourself non-compliant at any moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Keeping track of information flowing through Apache Kafka will be especially important when it comes to conducting audits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But Apache Kafka as a black box doesn’t make this easy.</p><p>This usually means weeks if not months of manual reporting and interviewing teams when it comes to a compliance audit.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the first problem we're addressing with our<a href="https://help.lenses.io/using-lenses/data/data-policies/"> Data Policies</a>.</p><p>We do this by intelligently keeping track of metadata across your Kafka Streams, no matter the serialization (CSV, <a target="_blank" href="https://lenses.io/videos/custom-serde-classes-google-protobuf-for-apache-kafka/">Protobuf </a>and custom proprietary formats).&nbsp;</p><p>It’s the same technology that powers our <a target="_blank" href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/07/Why-new-Streaming-SQL-opens-up-data-platform/">SQL engine</a> to query data on the wire as well as our <a target="_blank" href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/07/data-dump-real-time-data-catalog-apache-kafka/">data catalog</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>And it's presented as a data experience UI. Having a variety of ways to interface with data policies makes it easier to zoom in or out of topics and applications to see how they are interrelated, whether in a list or in a Topology as shown here:</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/4ZsimkLEYFBGwb0hyLIl42/e02f5ddd45be08a4bddc0b1c3fadb865/Data-Policies-Illustrations_04.png" alt="Data-Policies-Kafka"></p><p>Understanding how data is related allows us to define interesting fields that represent datasets.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span><p>The new buzz word in town is the term CTO. As all industries start to embrace technology as part of the core business, the person incharge of this technology will then start to grow in its important. Do you then know what does the role of a CTO entails? Beyond the glamorous term comes with a ton of responsibilities that is paramount for the development of the company across its stages. If you ever aspire to be a CTO yourself someday, this article is for you.</p>
<br>

<p>We will be going through these sections:</p>

<p>What does CTO do across stages of a startup</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Challenges</p>
</li>

<h2>What does CTO do across stages of a startup</h2>
<br>
<h3>1. Pre-seed stage</h3>

<p>Here you have 0 - 1 developer to basically kick start your entire idea. From git repo initilisation to actually be able to see a UI. Here is where your pre-seed stage will be.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Building the MVP</li>
</ul>

<p>Startup CTOs should be well versed in the tools and technologies available for building MVPs, whether those be web apps, mobile apps, desktop software. They cannot be afraid to get their hands dirty because even if there is a budget to hire a team, the CTO plays backup for any roles that cannot be immediately filled.</p>

<p>You need to create this MVP that can be able to gain real-time user feedback as fast as possible.</p>
<br>
<h3>2. Early startup</h3>

<p>You actually have some intermittent market feedback of a market fit and now you are looking to ramp up your development work. Here, you will look to have 1 - 10 engineers to kick start your development process. I’ve come to believe that different companies sits in this stage for various durations. The size of the engineering team should only appropriately grow in proportion with the performance and traction of the product or service. You do not want to find yourself to be in a situation where you are mass-hiring but each engineers are actually relatively unproductive. You should only ramp up the size of the engineering when you have processes in place to better manage these additional manpower. Truly, many cooks spoil the broth. Listed below are some of the scope of a CTO in the early start phase:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Hiring engineers, IT professionals, and data scientists.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finding and bringing on engineering talent is one of the hardest things for tech startups to do. Hiring for cultural fit at a small startup is challenging. Many developers want to specialize while startups demand generalists.</p>

<p>CTO at a startup has to be good at hiring, onboarding, training, and eventually replacing the company’s technical staffs. Having a proven hiring process and strong network will help.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Figuring out company-wide security</li>
</ul>

<p>When no security policy was done before, it falls onto the lap of CTOs to own the security component, run audits, document security procedures, and train everyone on the basis of it.</p>

<p>Simple security includes a VPN to protect your servers &amp; database from public access.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Product management</li>
</ul>

<p>While the CTOs primary goal is to make the vision of the non-technical product manager a reality, it also means that they have to manage the flow of work into the engineering team. Often times, CTOs take an active role in laying out the product planning process. It is common for startup CTOs to learn both product and technology. Its challenging but learning new things is the norm at startups.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Clear technical debts<br>
A good startup CTO will recognize when poor architecture is slowing down the team, and will step in to settle these technical debts when needed. Eventually these architecture clean ups may be delegated to senior engineers, but it will be likely to fall onto the CTO once in a while.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Bug triage</li>
</ul>

<p>First without a Quality Assurance team, it falls onto the CTO to triage bugs, replicate and document down the behavior of the feature, then distribute these bugs to the team for a fix. Deciding how to debug an issue requires detailed understanding of the implementation.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>QA and testing</li>
</ul>

<p>Without a proper initial team of quality assurance engineers, the testing layer falls onto the responsibility of the engineering team, headed by the CTO. Planning out the testing layers requires hands-on, hands dirty experiments.</p>
<p>Attached is an article on how to create your testing layer in your company. Check it out <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/testing-layers">here</a>.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>DevOps</li>
</ul>

<p>Your servers are your digital assets, and until a DevOps engineer is hired to manage these assets, it will too fall onto the CTO to manage them during the interim period.</p>
<br>
<h3>3. Growth</h3>

<p>Here the company has been gaining traction and is now looking to grow the team from 10 - 100 engineers. The company’s product is starting to mature and people are looking to settle into your company as a possible career-long alternative. In here, then you have to focus on ensuring employee retention and a healthy career progression for each of your employees.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Vendor and customer relationship</li>
</ul>

<p>The CTO has to be clear to figure out what is needed to be done to streamline the company’s technical cost. It could be for the developers processes, or the company’s process through technology.<br>
This is essential if the product is starting to integrate with other softwares or has its own API. The external technical relationships will be the responsibility of the CTO. This is essential if we have power users whom are integrating with us, requesting for some ‘must-have’ features.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Team growth management</li>
</ul>

<p>Managing a team of 5 is different from managing a team of 100. Once the company expands and grow, you will start to hire more specialised engineers which isn’t looking for exciting and challenging tasks. Their focus will just be the traditional benefits, vacation days, and a structured career ladder. The ability to develop the skillset to manage the startup across different life stages will also be the challenge the CTO has to undergo.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Employee retention</li>
</ul>

<p>The early employees whom joined for the challenges may consider other options as the startup phases into a mid-sized startup. As tech workers has plenty of options, its rare to keep one for more than 2, 3 years. The CTO that moves the company across phases has to learn how to retain their employees with strong alignment to the worker’s personal goals.</p>
<br>
<h3>4. Expansion</h3>

<p>Generally, once you are in the phase of expansion, you have to be laser focused to get your technology vision and mission in your company. This does not imply that your company has to utilize the latest technology all the time. Fundamentally, what is your company’s vision and problem statement? Focus on that, and ensure that we are using the best technology available out there to achieve this goal.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/q9pg24tufqwzoog/expansion.png?raw=1" alt=""></p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>The challenges a CTO face will be endless. Even as a developer, the amount of challenges you face are endless and everyday you have a ton of todos and blockers to clear. More specifically for CTOs, just as I was reading up on the this aspect, the key challenges faced by all CTOs are primarily hiring and alignment with business people.</p>
<br>
<h3>1. Hiring</h3>

<p>Good engineers that can help you to marry business and technology are hard to find. It will be all the more in demand in times when the world is embracing digital transformation. Even investors are willing to put their millions into savings plans through video calls. It is key to hire not just gifted engineers but those whom will also help shape the culture of the business.</p>
<br>
<h3>2. Focusing on customer engagement</h3>

<p>If you want to create a good technology, it is only just as good as whom the technology is created for. You may create the world’s first robotic arm for minimally invasive surgery but if i’m only washing dishes, why would that be of value to me? You have to benchmark the quality of your product to the utility of your target audience. They have the valuable feedback. In a world where there is a imperfect information, one can only move in the most informed decision; but always with a certain level of uncertainty and risk. Continuously engage with your ‘customers’ and find out what will empower them and set them up to do more with less using your product.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>5 Key learning opportunities</h2>

<p>Not everyone is born ready for such a big role. It will stretch you, ‘forces’ you to rise up to the occasion and you may even be surprised by what you are able to achieve when you’re placed under the pressurized cooker of your business demands. Generally, CTO is a leadership role. As glamorous as it may sound, it is still in essence just a role. What is most important is the being that is placed in that role. Are you developing yourself to face the bigger problems that are before you?</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Technical knowledge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technical leadership and strategy planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communication and Mentoring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project management and Operational excellence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sense of entrepreneurship and anticipation of the future</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>What better way to find out your key areas of learning opportunities than to hear from founders themselves. Here’s a video that sums this up</p>

<br>
<h2>TLDR;</h2>

<p>The end goal, the article gives a in-depth glimpse into the scope of a CTO’s day to day. How then can one possibly keep up with this pace of work? Only if you have a clear vision of the possible future. Technology is no longer just a tool for your Business-as-usual. It could possibly shape your future and redesign how life could be, should be, and will be.</p>

<p>From here on, I wish to share with you all a really cool podcast called <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://moderncto.io/">Modern CTO</a>. It is a podcast whom CTOs of all different companies will share some of their thoughts, journey, and learnings as CTOs. One thing is common: their level of curiosity for the world around them. Whatever role you are to play, stay curious and be a future explorer!</p>

                    <p>It has become fashionable to lambast big tech corporations and social media sites, the Facebooks and Twitters and Googles, blaming them for a litany of social ills. Seemingly escaping this ire has been the—in my view—most pernicious by far: Netflix.</p><p>Simply put, Netflix (and its imitators) produce too many TV shows that are too good—and too easy to binge. Consequently, too many great minds spend their time watching TV rather than thinking and inventing and creating.</p><h2 id="the-greatness-we-lose">The Greatness We Lose</h2><p>Consider the writer Matthew Yglesias. He just wrote an excellent <a href="https://www.amazon.com/One-Billion-Americans-Thinking-Bigger/dp/0593190211/">book</a>, which partially inspired my <a href="https://www.forourposterity.com/canada-and-mexico-should-join-the-union/">last post</a>. Recently, Yglesias <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200912220900/https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1304904789055156225">tweeted</a>:</p><blockquote>Someone asked … “how’d you get this book written without taking time off work?” and the dumb boring answer was basically “didn’t watch much TV for six months.”</blockquote><p>He adds,</p><blockquote>I am perfectly aware that the difference between times when I’m most productive &amp; creative and times when I’m not is how much of the week I waste on watching television, yet tonight I’m almost certainly going to finish season two of Hannibal.</blockquote><p>Yglesias, turn off the TV! Write more books instead! Heck, write more tweets, if you prefer!</p><p>Just think of all the original ideas Yglesias could be contributing if he continued to abstain from watching TV. Of them we are being robbed. That is an epic <a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/murder-of-wilbur/">tragedy</a>.</p><h2 id="why-modern-tv-is-different">Why Modern TV Is Different</h2><p>I don’t mean to pick on Yglesias. In fact, I don’t blame him. Modern shows are just too good. As a result, it’s become accepted—even the norm—among elite, educated classes to watch inordinate amounts of TV.</p><p>Modern shows are different from classic TV in two key ways. First, they are much more engrossing. Netflix shows are just on a different level in terms of quality than what TV once offered. Second, they are bingeable. Instead of tuning in for an hour each week, Netflix encourages viewers to enter the dark hole of watching episode after episode after episode. This becomes a vicious cycle. Viewers binge late into the night, lose sleep, and then don’t feel energetic enough to do much in their free time the next day besides…watching more Netflix.</p><p>Movies were always pretty engrossing. But the boundless quantity of content on Netflix—as well as their deliberate addictiveness—puts it on a different level.</p><p>To be sure, the broad America public has always watched <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/05/when-did-tv-watching-peak/561464/">extraordinary amounts</a> of television, in particular retirees. For them, the improved quality of modern shows is surely an upgrade. But I do think Netflix has distinctly changed the culture around TV among the young and educated.</p><p>As an undergraduate at Columbia, it was extremely common for students to spend much of their free time engorging themselves on Netflix. Many were caught in that maelstrom of bingeing, losing sleep, and then bingeing more. What was most shocking was this practice’s sheer acceptability. Watching dozens of hours of Netflix a week wasn’t something out of the ordinary, something people were embarrassed by. Rather, Netflix bingeing was a core part of the culture, something people would make countless memes about and base their identities on. Amazingly, people’s chief complaint was often that they had exhausted all of Netflix’s content (how do you even do that?!).</p><p>Yglesias got his start blogging in college. Would the next Yglesias be able to do the same? Or would his free time and energy instead be sucked up by the latest, ever-more addictive Netflix show? What a loss for civilization that would be.</p><h2 id="for-a-new-temperance-movement">For a New Temperance Movement</h2><p>Again, I don’t blame the students. I am victim to the same human follies. But I do blame the culture we have created. We don’t tell our bright young minds that it’s alright to waste away your days drinking or abusing drugs. Sure, some end up doing so regardless, but the cultural tabu keeps those impulses in check. Why do we tell them it’s alright to waste away your days watching Netflix?</p><p>Indeed, there has been considerable pushback against video games, which for some are a similar time suck. While many still struggle, this cultural pushback has kept video games in check. At least among the educated classes, Netflix and its imitators have become the far greater time suck.</p><p>For those who can enjoy TV in moderation—great. Modern shows are often meaningful art worth appreciating. The problem with modern TV is that for many, it is closer to alcoholism than a one-off drink. One you watch that first episode—take that first drink—it often doesn’t stay at one episode—as it doesn’t stay at one drink.</p><p>Perhaps it is time for a modern TV-temperance movement. It would be worth encouraging moderation in TV consumption in general. But given that many TV habits resemble alcoholism, it may be appropriate to take a more radical approach: advocating TV-abstinence. Although complete avoidance of TV may be difficult at first, once it becomes a habit, I think most wouldn’t miss much. But they would enjoy an abundance of reclaimed time and energy. And the rest of us would enjoy the wonderful works they create with that newfound time and energy.</p><h2 id="brains-in-vats">Brains in Vats</h2><p>The culture we establish around Netflix matters not just for the present, but for what comes next. As entertainment technology relentlessly advances, are we destined to become brains in vats, nominally pumped full of artificial bliss but doomed to lives of passivity and complacency?</p><p>Look, if that’s what the Europeans want to do, they should go for it. But part of what makes America special is a certain harshness—first embodied in the Puritans and their quest to settle America’s unforgiving wilderness. Great achievements, new ideas, ingenious inventions emerge from a culture that prizes travail and perseverance, not one that prioritizes comfort and ephemeral satisfaction.</p><p>A blithe acceptance of Netflix has insidiously infiltrated our culture. We should push back. Let’s look to the stars, not the next episode.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="content-pane"><div><p>The founding stories of big tech companies get people pumped on the idea of starting their own thing, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">SaaS</a> products to <a href="https://trends.vc/trends-0036-paid-newsletters/" title="https://trends.vc/trends-0036-paid-newsletters/">paid newsletters</a> . The concept sounds awesome. Build something, it picks up speed, and swiftly grows into a multi-million dollar company. It’s a crazy success story, you’re set for life! Silicon Valley has no shortage of examples to be gawked at: AirBnb, Amazon, Dropbox, Facebook, Google, Netflix, etc which all exploded in the last 15 years.</p><p>Once you start trying to create it, though, odds are your idea is not a runaway success. There are ideas where the problem is so important, so valuable, so sticky to businesses that you can give them the worst pile of garbage in the world and they will fork over bajillions of dollars. If you are in that camp and pulling in cash is as easy as drinking water, stop reading, this isn’t for you.</p><p>Getting users is really freakin’ hard. Getting customers who will pay you to use your idea is even harder. When you’re struggling to acquire new users, it’s frustrating to look at the big tech companies and realize they have millions, if not billions of users. How are you ever supposed to convince that many people your idea is awesome, but you’re struggling to get just 10.</p><p>Divorce yourself from the notion you need to match those giant tech companies. How many customers does it actually take to support one person? Is it a million? 100,000? 10,000? Try 99.</p><p>I’ll back it up with the math in a second, but for now, think about how awesome this is. 99 is an achievable number. You know more than 99 people on a first-name basis. You’ve waited in lines longer than 99 people! But, I’m just some guy on the internet saying this. Heck, for all you know I’m not actually a person, this is just a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/16/21371049/gpt3-hacker-news-ai-blog" title="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/16/21371049/gpt3-hacker-news-ai-blog">pile of words GPT-3 thinks sound nice together</a>. So let’s break it down and see how you only need 99 people’s support to make a drastic change to your life.</p><h2 id="assumptions--definitions">Assumptions &amp; Definitions</h2><p>Assumptions first. I’ll be calculating this for one person, but it should scale up if you have a team. When it comes to making money, I see several inflection points of Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR).</p><ol><li>$1</li><li><strong>Beer Money (BM) MRR</strong> - $100</li><li><strong>Rent MRR</strong> - $1,000</li><li><strong>College Grad (CG) MRR</strong> - $5,000</li><li><strong>Magical (MA) MRR</strong> - $10,000</li></ol><p>Stage 1, you’ve made your first dollar. Somebody out there thinks your idea doesn’t suck. Celebrate this, it’s a big achievement! One caveat for your dollar, it does <strong>NOT</strong> count if it came from your mom.</p><p>At <strong>Beer Money MRR</strong>, you are making $100 every month. You have cracked the 3 digit barrier, and can buy a lot of beer/wine/cheese/whatever without feeling too guilty about your budget.</p><p><strong>Rent MRR</strong> is where things get good, this is $1,000 a month. In some places this isn’t enough to live on by itself, but it is life-changing money no matter where you are. It likely covers all or a good chunk of your rent, hence the name. If you are poo-pooing me for saying $1k MRR is a big deal, you should get your head out of your ass and look at the rest of the world outside your bubble.</p><p><strong>College Grad MRR</strong> is $5k a month. This is $60k a year, which is near the average for a college graduate in the U.S. and more importantly, the math is easy when it divides nice. No calculators needed to read this article!</p><p><strong>Magical MRR</strong> is the last stop for this train. This is $10k a month, which is a <strong>TON</strong> of money. You’ll have taxes and expenses and junk, but to have people paying you $120k a year to use your idea must feel fantastic. I call it magical because $10k gets thrown around a lot in indie hacker articles &amp; community as a magic number to reach.</p><h2 id="show-me-the-money">Show Me the Money!</h2><p>Ok we have some definitions locked in, now we’ll go through 2 product examples: <strong>Product A</strong> at $10 and <strong>Product B</strong> at $50, again keeping the math easy. This could be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">SaaS</a> charging monthly, an eBook, a course, paid newsletter, whatever. We’re looking per month, so the specifics of what is pulling in the dough don’t matter for this article. I took a couple liberties to knock off 1 sale here and there to keep it to 2 or 3 digits, because seeing those inflection points is what inspires me personally. Only 2 digits of people? I can do that.</p><p><strong>Product A, $10:</strong></p><p><strong>BM =</strong> 10 people</p><p><strong>Rent =</strong> 99 people is all it takes</p><p><strong>CG =</strong> 500 people</p><p><strong>MA =</strong> 999 people a month need to feel like your idea is worth it</p><hr><p><strong>Product B, $50:</strong></p><p><strong>BM =</strong> 2 people</p><p><strong>Rent =</strong> 20 people is all it takes</p><p><strong>CG =</strong> 99 people</p><p><strong>MA =</strong> 200 people a month need to feel like your idea is worth it</p><p>You can reach a life changing amount of money from your side hustle, and you need to convince less than 1,000 people that what you do/create/build is worth it. It’s often thrown around that you need <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/" title="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/">1,000 true fans</a>, or as the math would suggest, just 99. Out of <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/" title="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/">7.8 billion</a> humans, you only need 99 in your corner to break the threshold to <strong>Rent MRR</strong>. It’s still a large group of people, don’t get me wrong. I would be terrified to give a speech to that crowd, but it’s small enough you can comprehend it. To make it even easier, let’s do some visualizations and connect these numbers to concrete concepts in our lives. Recognizing a connection with something you already know helps it feel achievable.</p><h3 id="20-people">20 People</h3><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>At some point in your life, you’ve been in a class greater than 20 people.</p><p>Your extended family gatherings are close to this many people.</p><p>You’ve likely been forced to give a presentation to <em>at least</em> this many listeners.</p><h3 id="99-people">99 People</h3><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>You’ve waited in lines longer than 99 people.</p><p>This is a small lecture hall, mostly full.</p><p>You could reasonably have a short conversation with 99 different people over the course of a day.</p><h3 id="200-people">200 People</h3><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️ - 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️</p><p>A couple hundred people could fit in a crowded bar or a conference presentation.</p><p>You can know the names and faces of 200 people with very little effort.</p><p>The majority of you have <a href="https://brandongaille.com/17-great-facebook-friend-statistics/" title="https://brandongaille.com/17-great-facebook-friend-statistics/">more than 200 friends on Facebook</a>.</p><p>If you’ve ever worked in a customer facing job, you’ve probably talked to more than 200 people in one shift!</p><h3 id="500-people">500+ People</h3><p><a href="https://blog.lime.link/visualizing-crowd-sizes/" title="https://blog.lime.link/visualizing-crowd-sizes/">This article</a> gives a great rundown of audience sizes from 50 to 100k people, and it’ll have to cover for the 500+ user visualizations. I won’t make you look at another 1499 emoji people. Okay, just one more. This is you making something awesome for all these people 👩‍💻 .</p><h2 id="the-real-world">The Real World</h2><p>The real world can be brutal when theories come into contact with it. It’s easy for me to sit here and talk about how you only need 99 customers to change your world, but you want to see something to back it up and show it still rings true out in the wild. Luckily, there are a lot of companies that share their stats as a part of being <a href="https://trends.vc/trends-0015-open-startups/" title="https://trends.vc/trends-0015-open-startups/">Open Startups</a>, many listed at <a href="https://openstartup.dev/" title="https://openstartup.dev/">https://openstartup.dev/</a> and <a href="https://baremetrics.com/open-startups" title="https://baremetrics.com/open-startups">https://baremetrics.com/open-startups</a>. You can also find great interviews on <a href="http://starterstory.com/" title="http://starterstory.com">starterstory.com</a>, where they go in-depth on how people started their businesses and their current revenue. Diving into a few data points from Nov 2020:</p><p>$1.3k : 124 users - <strong>Grip</strong> <a href="https://grip.baremetrics.com/" title="https://grip.baremetrics.com/"><em>https://grip.baremetrics.com/</em></a></p><p>$5.3k : 49 users - **Friendly **<a href="https://friendly.baremetrics.com/" title="https://friendly.baremetrics.com/"><em>https://friendly.baremetrics.com/</em></a></p><p>$7.0k : 144 users - <strong>Bannerbear</strong> <a href="https://www.bannerbear.com/open/" title="https://www.bannerbear.com/open/"><em>https://www.bannerbear.com/open/</em></a></p><p>$7.6k : 513 users - <strong>Simple Analytics</strong> <a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/open" title="https://simpleanalytics.com/open"><em>https://simpleanalytics.com/open</em></a></p><p>$9.0k : 479 users - <strong>Software Ideas</strong> (Paid reports/newsletter) <a href="https://softwareideas.baremetrics.com/" title="https://softwareideas.baremetrics.com/"><em>https://softwareideas.baremetrics.com/</em></a></p><p>$11k : 728 users - <strong>Hypefury</strong> <a href="https://hypefury.baremetrics.com/" title="https://hypefury.baremetrics.com/"><em>https://hypefury.baremetrics.com/</em></a></p><p>. . . . and then a crazy one</p><p>$<strong>133k</strong> : 871 users - **Baremetrics **<a href="https://demo.baremetrics.com/" title="https://demo.baremetrics.com/"><em>https://demo.baremetrics.com/</em></a></p><p>These companies are in all sorts of industries, they all have less than 1,000 users, and yet are making at minimum <strong>Rent MRR.</strong> While most of the Open Startups I listed are SaaS products built by developers, don’t be discouraged if you are non-technical or not interested in building software. There are examples out there of people growing non-technical products like ebooks, courses, newsletters, and more to sustain their livelihood if you take the time to look. Starter Story, mentioned above, is a collection of interviews &amp; ideas built up to <a href="https://www.starterstory.com/open" title="https://www.starterstory.com/open">$18k MRR in ~2 years</a>.

You can aim to just support yourself. Find your true fans, as Kevin Kelley calls them in his essay <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/" title="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/">1000 true fans</a>, and create for them.</p><p>This is not to trivialize the work needed to get to $100 MRR , or 10 users that love your product. It’s hard to get users. But making your vision more achievable helps keep the fire burning. It feels different pulling in the 1st of 99 people than the 1st of 100,000. So go forth and make something, you have the power and the global reach of the internet at your disposal. Go find 99 people that love your idea enough to pay you for it, and …</p></div></section></div>

                    <p>By Ryan Lambert -- Published November 29, 2020</p><p>A few months ago I started experimenting with a few project ideas
involving data over space and time.  Naturally, I want to use
Postgres and PostGIS as the main workhorse for these projects,
the challenge was working out exactly how to pull it all together.
After a couple false starts I had to put those projects aside for other priorities.
In my free time I have continued working through some related reading on the topic.
I found

by Anita Graser and recommend reading that before continuing with this post.
In fact, read <a href="https://www.austriaca.at/0xc1aa5576_0x00390cbe">Evaluating Spatio-temporal Data
Models for Trajectories in PostGIS
Databases</a>
while you're at it!  There is great information in those resources
with more links to other resources.</p>
<p>This post outlines examples of how to use these new PostGIS trajectory tricks with
OpenStreetMap data I already have available
(<a href="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2020/01/postgis-osm-load-2020">load</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/rustprooflabs/pgosm">prepare</a>
).
Often, trajectory examples assume using data collected from our
new age of IoT sensors sending GPS points and timestamps.  This example approaches
trajectories from a data modeling perpective instead, showing how to synthesize trajectory data using <code>pgrouting</code>.
Visualization of data is a critical component of sharing information,
<a href="https://qgis.org/">QGIS</a>
has long been my favorite GIS application to use with PostGIS data.</p>

<h2>Route data</h2>
<p>Routes for this example are created with manually selected start (<code>s_id</code>)
and end (<code>e_id</code>) nodes.  These id values line up to pgrouting node data
in the table <code>osm_routing.roads_noded_vertices_pgr</code>.
To set the stage for temporal data a start time (<code>s_time</code>) is also included.  This example
gives each route a start time of 5:00 AM, but makes it easy to adjust start times to explore
the impact.</p>
<pre><code>route_id|s_id |e_id  |s_time             |
--------|-----|------|-------------------|

       7|30505|113816|2020-11-01 05:00:00|
</code></pre>
<p>The start and end nodes (<code>r.s_id</code> and <code>r.e_id</code> below) are fed into pgrouting's <code>pgr_dijkstra()</code> routing function.
The <code>osm_routing.roads</code> table contains OpenStreetMap data for Denver, CO prepared by PgOSM.
The <code>pgosm.layer_detail</code> and <code>pgosm.routable</code> tables are used to
easily filter down to roads usable by motorized traffic (cars).
The <code>osm_routing.roads_noded</code> (edges) table was prepared with <code>pg_routing</code> and is based on the base <code>osm_routing.roads</code> table.</p>
<p>The route details are created and saved into a new table
(<code>osm_routing.route_details</code>) using the following query. </p>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE osm_routing.route_details AS
WITH rte AS (
SELECT * 
    FROM osm_routing.routes
)
SELECT r.route_id, d.*, n.the_geom AS node_geom, e.the_geom AS edge_geom
    FROM rte r
    INNER JOIN pgr_dijkstra(
        'SELECT rn.id, rn.source, rn.target, rn.cost_length AS cost,
                rn.the_geom
            FROM osm_routing.roads_noded rn
            INNER JOIN osm_routing.roads r ON rn.old_id = r.id
            INNER JOIN pgosm.layer_detail ld ON ld.code = r.code
            INNER JOIN pgosm.routable rbl
                ON rbl.layer_detail_id = ld.layer_detail_id
                    AND rbl.route_motor
            ',
        r.s_id, r.e_id, directed := False
        ) d
        ON True
    INNER JOIN osm_routing.roads_noded_vertices_pgr n ON d.node = n.id
    INNER JOIN osm_routing.roads_noded e ON d.edge = e.id
;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>pgr_dijkstra()</code> function returns one row for each step of a given route.
The <code>route_id</code> value links back to <code>osm_routing.routes</code>.
The <code>cost</code> used a simple length based cost with meters as the unit.
The <code>node</code> and <code>edge</code> values point back to the id values in their respective tables
used by pgrouting.</p>
<pre><code>route_id|seq|path_seq|node |edge |cost              |agg_cost          |

<p>The nodes (blue circles) and edges (red lines) for each of the routes are shown
below.  We can easily confirm with code (<code>ST_Intersects()</code>) and visually on
the map that these routes intersect using simple spatial checks.
Would these routes intersect if time was also considered?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The animated version of these routes is at the bottom of this post under <em>Animate in QGIS</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Path to Trajectory</h2>
<p>A simple approach to adding time to geometry is by adding two <code>TIMESTAMPTZ</code> columns
for start and end times. Unfortunately this simple approach quickly falls apart
as later queries will illustrate.
Luckily, the PostGIS extension comes to the rescue (again) with built in trajectory
support.  What is a trajectory?
It starts with at least two points that include a Measure (<code>M</code>)
representing time.  These points can be created with
<a href="https://postgis.net/docs/ST_MakePointM.html"><code>ST_MakePointM()</code></a>.
Points including <code>M</code> can be made into a line with <code>ST_MakeLine()</code>, and
now you have a trajectory.</p>
<p>The key detail added to make a trajectory is <code>M</code>, or the Measure.
Many trajectory use cases use time as the measure. Unfortunately,
the <code>TIMESTAMPTZ</code> format cannot be used but using
the epoch is an easy enough workaround in Postgres.</p>
<h2>Assign Speeds</h2>
<p>To get to a <code>M</code> value for each step of the route we need the speed traveled
for each edge.  Add a column for <code>edge_mph</code>.</p>
<pre><code>ALTER TABLE osm_routing.route_details ADD edge_mph NUMERIC;
</code></pre>
<p>Quite a series of joins to get back to the speed limit.
In the future this step will most likely be done far earlier on in the data processing pipeline.</p>
<pre><code>UPDATE osm_routing.route_details rd_update
    SET edge_mph = rbl.max_speed
    FROM osm_routing.route_details rd
    INNER JOIN osm_routing.routes rte ON rd.route_id = rte.route_id
    INNER JOIN osm_routing.roads_noded rn ON rd.edge = rn.id
    INNER JOIN osm_routing.roads r ON rn.old_id = r.id
    INNER JOIN pgosm.layer_detail ld ON ld.code = r.code
    INNER JOIN pgosm.routable rbl ON rbl.layer_detail_id = ld.layer_detail_id
    WHERE rd_update.route_id = rd.route_id
        AND rd_update.seq = rd.seq
        AND rd_update.path_seq = rd.path_seq
;
</code></pre>
<h2>Calculate time for each edge</h2>
<p>Add a column to store the time for each node.</p>
<pre><code>ALTER TABLE osm_routing.route_details ADD node_ts TIMESTAMPTZ;
</code></pre>
<p>To get the value for each <code>node_ts</code> we need to calculate
cost in seconds based on an edge's speed.  Our distance is in meters, our
speed in MPH, and we need seconds.  Perfect use case for a function!</p>
<p>The following function accepts two parameters, <code>length_m</code> and a <code>miles_per_hour</code>,
and returns the time in seconds required to travel the edge.</p>
<pre><code>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION osm_routing.mph_length_m_to_cost_seconds(
    length_m NUMERIC, miles_per_hour NUMERIC)
 RETURNS NUMERIC
 LANGUAGE sql
 SECURITY DEFINER
 SET search_path TO 'pg_temp'
AS $function$
/*
 * miles per hour * 0.44704  = meters per second
 */
    SELECT ($1 / ($2 * .44704))

$function$
;
</code></pre>
<p>This makes it easy to calculate the time to traverse an edge based on its length and
speed. How many seconds does it take to travel 1,000 meters at 60 miles per hour?</p>
<pre><code>SELECT osm_routing.mph_length_m_to_cost_seconds(1000, 60);

mph_length_m_to_cost_seconds|
----------------------------|
         37.2822715342400382|
</code></pre>
<p>What about 1000 meters at 20 mph?</p>
<pre><code>SELECT osm_routing.mph_length_m_to_cost_seconds(1000, 20);

mph_length_m_to_cost_seconds|
----------------------------|
        111.8468146027201145|
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>edge_times</code> CTE below uses the <code>mph_length_m_to_cost_seconds()</code> function
to calculate each segment's time to traverse.
The <code>time_to_node</code> CTE uses uses <code>SUM()</code> as a window function to provide a running total of
cost in time to each node.  The final <code>UPDATE</code> query sets the <code>node_ts</code> to the 
route's start time (from <code>osm_routing.routes</code>) plus the appropriate number of seconds
from the previous window function.</p>
<pre><code>WITH edge_times AS (
SELECT r.route_id, rd.seq, rd.path_seq, 
        r.s_time, rd.cost, rd.agg_cost, rd.edge_mph,
        CASE WHEN (rd.edge_mph &gt; 0 AND agg_cost &gt; 0)
            THEN osm_routing.mph_length_m_to_cost_seconds(rd.cost::NUMERIC, rd.edge_mph)
            ELSE NULL
            END AS edge_time_s
    FROM osm_routing.routes r
    INNER JOIN osm_routing.route_details rd ON True
    WHERE r.route_id = rd.route_id
), time_to_node AS (
SELECT SUM(et.edge_time_s)
            OVER (PARTITION BY et.route_id ORDER BY et.seq, et.path_seq)
            AS time_to_node_s,
        *
    FROM edge_times et
)
UPDATE osm_routing.route_details rd
    SET node_ts = ttn.s_time + (ttn.time_to_node_s || ' seconds')::INTERVAL
    FROM time_to_node ttn
    WHERE rd.route_id = ttn.route_id
        AND rd.seq = ttn.seq
        AND rd.path_seq = ttn.path_seq
        AND rd.node_ts IS NULL
;
</code></pre>
<p>The above <code>UPDATE</code> query does not set the route's initial node. The following
<code>UPDATE</code> fixes the first record in each route equal to the <code>s_time</code>.</p>
<pre><code>UPDATE osm_routing.route_details rd
    SET node_ts = r.s_time
    FROM osm_routing.routes r
    WHERE rd.route_id = r.route_id
        AND rd.node_ts IS NULL
        AND rd.seq = 1
;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>osm_routing.route_details</code> table now includes a speed limit and timestamp
for each segment for the included routes.</p>
<pre><code>route_id|seq|path_seq|edge_mph|node_ts            |
--------|---|--------|--------|-------------------|
       1|  1|       1|   45.00|2020-11-01 05:00:00|

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>The <code>grep</code> tool is a real workhorse for shell users - once you've learned how to use it you will find yourself using it again and again. In this chapter we'll see how you can use <code>grep</code> for common tasks, and how to use it in combination with other tools.</p><p>As with the other tools we'll introduce in this chapter, we'll also look at when <code>grep</code> is the right tool for the job and when we should consider other options.</p><p>A quick check of the manual page for <code>grep</code> gives an overview:</p><pre><code>$ man grep

GREP(1)                   BSD General Commands Manual                  GREP(1)

NAME
     grep, egrep, fgrep, zgrep, zegrep, zfgrep -- file pattern searcher

SYNOPSIS
     grep [-abcdDEFGHhIiJLlmnOopqRSsUVvwxZ] [-A num] [-B num] [-C[num]] [-e pattern] [-f file]
          [--binary-files=value] [--color[=when]] [--colour[=when]] [--context[=num]] [--label]
          [--line-buffered] [--null] [pattern] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The grep utility searches any given input files, selecting lines that match one or more
     patterns.  By default, a pattern matches an input line if the regular expression (RE) in
     the pattern matches the input line without its trailing newline.  An empty expression
     matches every line.  Each input line that matches at least one of the patterns is written
     to the standard output.
</code></pre><p>Wow. Lots of options for this command. And confusingly, lots of alternative forms as well (such as <code>egrep</code>, <code>zgrep</code> and so on).</p><p>Maybe the <code>tldr</code> tool will provide a more concise overview?</p><pre><code>$ tldr grep

  grep

  Matches patterns in input text.
  Supports simple patterns and regular expressions.
</code></pre><p>That is indeed a little more concise. By the way, if you are not familiar with how you can get help on commands, check out <a href="https://effective-shell.com/docs/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/5-getting-help/">Chapter 5 - Getting Help</a>. As the manual pages indicate, <code>grep</code> is used to match patterns in files. More advanced users will most likely know exactly what this means, but a more simple description is just:</p><blockquote><p>Grep lets you search for text or filter text.</p></blockquote><p>That's it. You can search in files, but you are not <em>limited</em> to searching in files. And you can search for <em>literal</em> text, such as the word ‘error’, or you can search for <em>patterns</em>. <em>Patterns</em> in this case means <em>regular expressions</em> - expressions which allow you to be more specific in how you search (such as looking for a set of 16 numbers in a row, like a credit card number, or any text which looks like an email address). You can also do the opposite - filtering out parts of text.</p><p>We'll use <code>grep</code> to search through text. Let's get straight into it!</p><p>Why the odd name? Grep is such a commonly used tool that the name has become a verb amongst technologists (people will often suggest you <em>grep</em> for something in files).</p><p>The name comes from a command which was used in the original <code>ed</code> text editor - the command:</p><pre><code>g/re/p
</code></pre><p>This command ran on all lines (<code>g</code>, for <em>global</em>), applied a regular expression (<code>re</code>, for <em>regular expression</em>) and then printed (<code>p</code> for <em>print</em>) the results. A colleague of Ken Thompson, one of the early innovators and inventors in the Unix world, needed to edit a large file - a file which was too large to fit in <code>ed</code>. Ken wrote the <code>grep</code> program overnight to allow the file's text to be filtered - and the results passed to the <code>ed</code> editor!</p><p>You can read more about this story and some of the fascinating history of the early days of Unix in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfOnGZUZDk&amp;feature=emb_title">great interview with Brian Kerninghan</a> from Computerphile<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p><p>If you've been working through this book, you've probably entered quite a few commands in the shell. Most shells keep a history of the commands you type. Under the hood, when you use the up and down keys to look through commands you entered earlier, or use the <code>Ctrl-R</code> shortcut to <em>search</em> through earlier commands, your shell is looking through this file. If these tricks are not familiar, check <a href="https://effective-shell.com/docs/part-2-core-skills/8-fly-on-the-command-line/">Chapter 9 - Fly on the Command Line</a>.</p><p>The file which keeps the history can vary from shell to shell. For example, on my system, my history for Bash is in the file <code>~/.bash_history</code>. But most ‘Bash-like’ shells provide a built-in environment variable which let's you find the path of the shell history. Let's at this file:</p><pre><code>cat $HISTFILE

...
cat ~/.ssh/config
ssh bastion.cloudops
help echo
help cd
exit
</code></pre><p>This file will generally contain a list of the commands that the logged in user has entered in their shell. This file will likely be huge. Let's search through it using <code>grep</code>! Here's how we can use the <code>grep</code> command to search for lines which contain the text <code>man</code>:</p><pre>grep man $HISTFILE

...
<strong>man</strong> socket
k describe services eventstoredb-http-<strong>man</strong>agement
<strong>man</strong> cal
gcb refactor/perfor<strong>man</strong>ce/standardise-eventstore
vi src/tests/handlers/test_com<strong>man</strong>d_handlers.py
gco src/handlers/com<strong>man</strong>d_handlers.py
gcb feat/perfor<strong>man</strong>ce/use-eventstore-writer
nvim perfor<strong>man</strong>ce.md
<strong>man</strong> grep
</pre><p>Here I can see all of the commands I have recently entered which have the text <code>man</code> in them. Note that the text which matches is highlighted and shown in bold.</p><p>Now what if you a different shell, or forget where the history file lives? A nice trick here is to use the <code>history</code> command. This command prints out the history, as well as the line number. The <code>history</code> command writes to <code>stdout</code>. If we don't give <code>grep</code> a source file, it will simply search through <code>stdin</code>. Just as we learnt in <a href="https://effective-shell.com/docs/part-2-core-skills/7-thinking-in-pipelines/">Chapter 7 - Thinking in Pipelines</a> this means we can just <code>grep</code> the output of the <code>history</code> command!</p><p>Here's how that would work:</p><pre>history | grep man

...
 9125  <strong>man</strong> socket
 9188  k describe services eventstoredb-http-<strong>man</strong>agement
 9211  <strong>man</strong> cal
 9341  gcb refactor/perfor<strong>man</strong>ce/standardise-eventstore
 9344  vi src/tests/handlers/test_com<strong>man</strong>d_handlers.py
 9347  gco src/handlers/com<strong>man</strong>d_handlers.py
 9352  gcb feat/perfor<strong>man</strong>ce/use-eventstore-writer
 9355  nvim perfor<strong>man</strong>ce.md
10002  <strong>man</strong> grep
</pre><p>This is easier to remember! There's one more cool trick - if we just type in the exclamation point symbol followed by any line number shown above, we repeat the command! For example, typing in:</p><pre><code>!9355
</code></pre><p>Would repeat line <code>9355</code> of the history (which is <code>nvim performance.md</code>).</p><p>Now as you can see from the output above, when we searched through my history, we didn't just find times I executed the <code>man</code> command - we found <em>any</em> line which has the characters <code>man</code> in it. What about if we only wanted to find the lines which start with <code>man</code>?</p><p>To perform a search like this, we can use a <em>regular expression</em>. Here's how it would work:</p><pre>history | grep "[0-9]\+  man"

...
 <strong>9125  man</strong> socket
 <strong>9211  man</strong> cal
<strong>10002  man</strong> grep
</pre><p>Let's break this down. In this search, we are using a <em>pattern</em> to search for text. The pattern in this case is a <em>basic regular expression</em>. Regular expressions allow us to use some clever constructs to search for text. The expression we've used is made up of the following components:</p><ul><li><code>[0-9]\+</code> At least one number - any character in the range zero to nine.</li><li><code>man</code> The literal text written, i.e. two spaces and the letters <code>man</code>.</li></ul><p>Now for anyone who is familiar with regular expressions, you might wonder why we have a slash before the <code>+</code> symbol, when the <code>+</code> symbol has a specific meaning in regular expressions (it means ‘at least one of the previous characters). The reason we have a leading slash is that by default <code>grep</code> is using <em>basic regular expressions</em>. In general, this will be less familiar for users and will be different to what they are used to from different tools.</p><p>To make regular expressions more ‘standard’, we can use the <code>-E</code> flag to tell <code>grep</code> to use <em>Extended Regular Expressions</em>. We can also use the <code>egrep</code> tool, which assumes the pattern will be an extended regular expression. Using either approach will work, and allow you to re-write the pattern as below:</p><pre><code>history | grep -E "[0-9]+  man"

# ...or...

history | egrep "[0-9]+  man"
</code></pre><p>This is just a little hint of the power of regular expressions. They can be daunting at first, and many people never become comfortable with them, but I would strongly encourage you to start exploring them.</p><p>If you ever want to see how a regular expression works, try using the website <a href="https://regex101.com/">regex101.com</a>. It let's you test out regular expressions and also describes exactly how they work. For example, if I enter the regular expression we just used I'll see this:</p><p><img src="https://effective-shell.com/docs/part-3-manipulating-text-and-streams/12-get-to-grips-with-grep/images/regex101.png" width="800px" alt="Screenshot of the 'regex101' website"></p><p>We're going to see more about regular expressions as we go through the book.</p><p>If there's one command I use a lot, it's this:</p><pre><code>grep -i err
</code></pre><p>The <code>-i</code> flag makes the search case-insensitive. This makes this a very quick way to scan through a file for any text which matches the letters <code>err</code> - making it a very quick way to find <em>errors</em> in log files.</p><p>You can try this out by using some of the log files in the <code>logs</code> folder of the playground.

<p>    Marwin Mueller, age 65, owns Spass GmbH. An SME in Luzern which has an annual turnover of close to 1.000.000 CHF and an annual profit of 200.000 CHF.  </p>
<p>    Spass GmbH has been operating in the hospitality industry for the last 30 years and is managing renouned hotels and villas in the Luzern Lake area.  </p>
<p>    Anne Kingston, age 29, is Marwins assistant and accountant. She has joined a year back and during her interactions, she mentioned to Marwin that she is a single mom of a six year old boy named Ryan.  </p>
<p>    Anne is a pleasant and helping personality. She likes plants and playing video games.  </p>
<p>    Marwin is very proud of his business achievements and sometimes acts as an arrogant boss. He is a bit insensitive to kids, due to his experiences. In general, he gets along with Anne and they form a great team at Spass. In the past year, Anne took over most of the office tasks at Spass. She is technology savvy and Marwin likes this quality of Anne's over his other staff.  </p>
<p>    Marwin and Anne worked on important digital initiatives at Spass like listing its properties on booking portals, creating their own website, launching social media accounts and enabling online banking at UBC Bank in Luzern.  </p>
<p>    This gave Marwin an edge over his competitors and Spass has seen a 30% increase in revenues and profits this year.  </p>
<p>    Today, Marwin remembers that two weeks back, Anne came to him and wanted a 1 week vacation to spend time with her son Ryan on occasion of his birthday.  </p>
<p>    Once again, Marwin and Anne had arguments on Anne's vacations in peak season and Marwin blamed Ryan for this.  At the end, Marwin reluctantly agreed to the holidays.</p>
<p>Since then, Anne did not turn up for work. She is not reachable on her mobile and her house is locked.</p>
<p>Marwin has just found that his bank account is debited with 2.000 CHF every day since Anne left.</p>
<p>Marwin has no idea what is happening and he is worried. Therefor, as trusted friends, he has requested that you come here and help him.</p>
<p>Marwin believes it is not a good idea to report the incident immediately to the police or bank as it can damage his reputation.</p>
<p>Now it's Friday. It's 7pm and the UBC Bank is already closed for the weekend.</p>
<p>You need to analyze the gaps Anne might have in her Cybersecurity awareness and secure the Online Banking to stop the money transfers.</p>
<p>Also, try to find out where Anne might be.</p>
<p>All the very best.

          <p>
            We investigate the limitions of statistical methods, a subclass of which is called "machine learning", taking the opportunity to touch on several aspects of the industry, including the future of employment, various industry practices, and privacy. It's written as a wide-audience article, and only assumes a passing familiarity with software and statistics. We start from a seemingly hardline stance, and follow a line of flawed reasoning leading up to the point where humans become near-obselete, an event commonly known as the "singularity". Finally, we step back to see where we stumbled.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use the following starting point: using any combination of statstical methods, of any complexity, it is impossible to develop any sort of "understanding" that resembles human intelligence. Instead of trying to tackle questions about the nature of intelligence, or entering a deep philosophical rabbit-hole about whether "intelligence is computable", we start with the modest goal of understanding what statistical methods are.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a starting point, one might argue that the world is made of up of a collection of "facts" that need to be "memorized" after having seen them stated multiple times correctly. A variation of this is the "monkey brain", in which you train the monkey by asking it to perform a certain task, rewarding it everytime it gets it right, and penalizing it everytime it gets it wrong. This is the basic idea behind "reinforcement learning", the kind used to get machines to play "games". Speed up the task-to-[reward or penalty] cycle exponentially, and you have a "smart monkey". While the "smart monkey" might make silly mistakes on a bad day for irrational reasons, a "bad day" for a statistical model is the event when it is presented with data that it doesn't know how to fit. The monkey's emotional engine can arguably be emulated by weighting the penalty that the machine receives, based on how fundamental the mistake was, and how many hours of training it had received. The procedure we've described of "training" a machine like this falls under the class of "supervised learning", which, as one might argue, is the same way a human learns from an assignment or exam.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let us assume that a machine can successfully memorize trillions of "facts", and look into how these might be represented. In most commonly-used applications today, they are encoded in the form of matrices of floating-point numbers, with some weighted arithmetic operations connecting them, as chosen by the person building the model. The model is fed a matrix of floating-point numbers, and outputs a matrix of floating-point numbers. We might argue that the inability to interpret these individual numbers is akin to not being able to interpret the voltages of the individual neurons in the brain, and this doesn't seem to be a problem in practice. The said "facts", now lost in a soup of numbers, can be generalized into a broader class of "things that can be inferred from data". With every attempt at being able to handle a new situation, the model simply does arithmetic on the soup (a large class of which are just matrix multiplications), and the numbers in the soup adjust themselves with every "feedback" we give it. This is the basic idea behind "neural networks". While it's easy to get lost in the details, note that we're still doing statistical analysis. The additional "frills" haven't changed the essential nature of the method: the machine is "learning by example", and attempting to "generalize" it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Among human beings, learning by example is a very effective way to learn, when starting out. Most programmers would attest to the fact that they started out by copying examples, tweaking them, and checking them with a program (these programs are known as "compilers"). Some would argue that this approach doesn't scale in human beings, because they don't have the computational power to continue learning by example, and "cheat" by reading some kind of specification as they become more experienced. Does it mean that classical programmers (aka. those not engaged in building statistical models) could be replaced by machines in the future?
          </p>
          <p>
            The key to seeing the viability of this argument is to consider two things: (1) the structural complexity of the task, and (2) the number of examples available to concretely reinforce the patterns, and nullify the anti-patterns. It's no secret that there are several good tools for aiding with "simple" programming langauages (otherwise called IDEs), which a reductionist would phrase as "machines are good at dumb tasks". Using simple frequency analysis, the IDE can order its auto-complete suggestions and corrections intelligently. To date, there is no IDE that can assist with the help of the vast repositories of open-souce code, but it doesn't require a big leap in imagination to assume that this will be possible in the future. In fact, we should be open to the possibility that compilers start building repositories of error-messages, and run in the background, suggesting even more intelligent fixes, based on how others who encountered a similar error fixed it. A philophically-minded reader would be interested in whether the "intent" of the programmer can be dissected, and if, by labelling various segments of publicly available code with some kind of abstract "function", the machine can write entire programs with a few prompts. Assuming for a minute that this might be possible, can classical programmers stay relevant by simply moving to newer languages or technologies, on which there are few examples?
          </p>
          <p>
            This poses a quandary: are we playing some kind of primal game, where the prey constantly has to come up with new strategies to outrun the predator? Some would argue that by refining our statistical methods, one can emulate the process of generalization effectively enough to beat the prey's creativity on the "search space" completely. What if this is the nature of every human specialization? An event, commonly referred to as the "singularity", whereby humans become near-obselete, is predicted in 2040. Why is this claim so ludicrous?
          </p>
          <hr>
          <p>
            To better understand where statistical models are succesful, let us enumerate some recent accomplishments in the field.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beating the best human player at Go, a program referred to as AlphaGo. The problem is well-defined, and there are very few starting rules. How does a human become good at Go? Just like in Chess, the rules play an insignificant role in the player's learning, and most of the training is about analyzing previous games. There are huge databases of expertly-played games available, and human players usually try to follow a semi-systematic approach. It could be argued that the machine is inefficient, because it doesn't follow a systematic approach, but the raw computational power makes this handicap look irrelevant. It's a little like arguing that a machine doesn't know the decimal system, or the tables of multiplication, and simply flips 0s and 1s to perform arithmetic. Humans here are the disadvataged class in both cases, and it is completely unsurprising that, despite certain "inefficiencies", AlphaGo essentially does what a human player does to beat them at it: analyzing lots of games.
          </p>
          <p>
            A language engine, referred to as GPT-3. How do humans master a natural language? They do it semi-systematically, starting from the association of simple words to real-world objects, then moving on to phrases describing something, learning some construction rules and absorbing culture along the way; and finally by reading a lot of good literature. Of course, the grammar rules play a very small part of the overall learning, so it is unsurprising that GPT-3 is able to produce grammatically correct responses to human-supplied prompts. However, literature talks about things in the real world, and for it to make sense, sufficient interaction with the real world is a prerequisite. It's not a bounded game, where all the necessary information is contained on a map or a board. It is, therefore, entirely unsurprising that GPT-3 can't "know" whether dropping a metallic plate would cause it to melt. It cannot infer the relationship between real-world objects, nor can it differentiate between factual and fictional human experiences. Producing good literature requires a whole lot more than that. This landmark achievement, despite having access to terabytes of text, and an unimaginable amounts of compute power, has failed to infer much more than grammar, sentence construction, and context.
          </p>
          <p>
            The translation engine behind Google Translate. Someone who has just started using the product with no knowledge of the underlying technology would be puzzled about why this is chalked up as an achievement. Indeed, it's unlikely that we'll even have a half-decent translation engine using purely statistical methods. Translation engines have been around for a long time, and their latest iteration might be a significant improvement over the previous ones, but on an absolute scale, something seems to be off about relying on a pure statistical method to learn natural language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Medical diagnostics. In this field, it is absolutely imperative to organize every little piece of data about every patient in a highly systematic manner: a missing entry is a life-or-death situation. On millions of these remarkably well-organized records, it should come as no surprise that a machine can serve as a valuable aid to a doctor. Statistical models have been a resounding success in this area. The achievement here, perhaps, should be attributed to the subfield of …</p></article></div>

                <p><strong>LONDON –</strong> Britain today became the first Western country to approve a Covid-19 vaccine for general use as it announced a rollout of Pfizer-BioNTech's drug from next week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The government has today accepted the recommendation from the independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to approve Pfizer-BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine for use," the Health Department said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The vaccine will be made available across the UK from next week," the statement said. Priority groups will include care home residents, health and care staff, the elderly and the clinically extremely vulnerable.</p>

<p>After months of "rigorous" clinical trials and thorough analysis of the data, the MHRA "concluded that the vaccine has met its strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness", the statement added.</p>

<p>"To aid the success of the vaccination programme, it is vital everyone continues to play their part and abide by the necessary restrictions in their area so we can further suppress the virus and allow the NHS (National Health Service) to do its work without being overwhelmed."</p>

<p>Pfizer chairman Albert Bourla said it was a "historic moment in the fight against Covid-19".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This authorisation is a goal we have been working toward since we first declared that science will win, and we applaud the MHRA for their ability to conduct a careful assessment and take timely action to help protect the people of the UK," he said.</p>

<p>Pfizer and BioNTech added that they expected further regulatory decisions from other countries "in the coming days and weeks".</p>

<p>The announcement came as England exited a month-long coronavirus lockdown, but most of the country remained under restrictions as a new regional system for cutting infection rates kicked in.</p>

<p>The four-week lockdown, which began last month, was imposed to stop surging rates of infection, ease pressure on health services, and to allow families to gather for Christmas.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a Covid survivor, succeeded in winning a vote on the measures in parliament late yesterday, despite significant opposition within his own Conservative ranks.</p>

<p>"All we need to do now is to hold our nerve until these vaccines are indeed in our grasp and indeed being injected into our arms," he told lawmakers before the vote.</p>

<p>Until then "we cannot afford to relax, especially during the cold months of winter", he warned. – AFP, December 2, 2020</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <div>

              
    <div>
      
            
      <p>Our mission to secure the world’s connected devices got a timely boost when the US Senate passed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr1668/BILLS-116hr1668eh.pdf" target="_blank">Internet of Things (“IoT”) Cybersecurity Improvement Act (H.R. 1668)</a> into law. This is the brainchild of Congresswoman Robin Kelly from Illinois.
The legislation provides for the establishment of a minimum set of cybersecurity standards for government purchased, internet connected devices.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been directed through the legislation to provide standards and guidelines for the  federal government agencies to comply with in order to better  manage the security of their IOT devices. These standards and guidelines are designed to provide a high level of continuity and more progress on the work already done by these agencies to address considerations around vulnerability detection, identity management, patching and the configuration of their IOT devices. </p>
<p><em>Don’t comply, Fed won’t buy</em></p>
<p>There is also a procurement dimension to the legislation and the law will require federal purchasers to apply restrictions on the purchase of devices from vendors who do not meet the NIST standards and guidelines. There are waivers in certain instances such as national security or research purposes, but the general rule will apply greater discipline to the treatment of security in product design and sale. This is obviously going to have a very big impact on manufacturers in the private sector who will need to meet these requirements to sell into federal government departments. There is likely to be an overspill effect into broader industrial and consumer electronics markets as the government starts to stand up and take IoT device security at all levels very seriously.</p>
<p><em>Get out of the kitchen if you can’t take the heat</em></p>
<p>It’s timely that in a <a href="https://mender.io/blog/good-news-the-u-s-house-passes-the-iot-cybersecurity-bill" target="_blank">recent blog post</a> our CEO Thomas Ryd noted that with these new IOT cybersecurity regulations being introduced, vendors who have not placed security at the center of their product development strategies will have to take a serious look at what they are doing, if they want to stay relevant and competitive in the market. </p>
<p>The <strong>Triangle of Trust</strong> is the strategic framework that guides product strategy and development at Northern.tech and Mender. We educate our customers to put this principle at the centre of their connected device management strategy. </p>
<p>Only <strong> authorised people</strong> can deploy <strong>authorised software</strong> to <strong>authorised devices</strong>. </p>
<p>Which leads to</p>
<p>Only the <strong> right people</strong> deploying the <strong>right software</strong> to the <strong>right devices</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Security in action in our IOT</em></p>
<p>We have developed the security features and strategic partnerships to translate this principle into operational reality for our customers. This puts us at the forefront of the market. For example, we work with NXP to support hardware encryption on their iMx gateway processors. This means that a device is highly secure from tampering with and malicious take over attempts. We also support Mutual TLS handshakes and PKP certificates and align to enterprise security standards and policies. We also consider less complex gateway devices and support elliptic curve cryptography for resource-efficient security and protection. </p>
<p>We thank Congresswoman Kelly for progressing and enacting this important legislation with fellow legislators in the US Senate. We believe that we are a provider that has prepared for this day, and have anticipated the requirements knowing that it was in the best interests of the customers we serve to make sure their devices avoid malicious attacks. </p>

    <p>It's 2020. Quarantines are everywhere – and here I'm writing about one, too.
But this quarantine is of a different kind.</p>

<p>In this article I'll describe the <strong>Linux Kernel Heap Quarantine</strong> that I developed
for mitigating kernel use-after-free exploitation. I will also summarize
the discussion about the prototype of this security feature on the Linux Kernel
Mailing List (LKML).</p>



<p>Use-after-free (UAF) vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel are very popular for
exploitation. There are many exploit examples, some of them include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q4/607">CVE-2016-8655</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/02/26/2">CVE-2017-6074</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2017/03/24/CVE-2017-2636.html">CVE-2017-2636</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ssd-disclosure.com/ssd-advisory-linux-kernel-af_packet-use-after-free/">CVE-2017-15649</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2020/02/15/CVE-2019-18683.html">CVE-2019-18683</a></li>
</ul>

<p>UAF exploits usually involve <strong>heap spraying</strong>.
Generally speaking, this technique aims to put attacker-controlled bytes at a defined memory
location on the heap. Heap spraying for exploiting UAF in the
Linux kernel relies on the fact that when <code>kmalloc()</code> is called, the slab
allocator returns the address of memory that was recently freed:</p>

<p>So allocating a kernel object with the same size and attacker-controlled
contents allows overwriting the vulnerable freed object:</p>

<center><a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf.png"><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf.png" width="70%"></a></center>


<p>Note: Heap spraying for out-of-bounds exploitation is a separate technique.</p>



<p>In July 2020, I got an idea of how to break this heap spraying technique for UAF
exploitation. In August I found some time to try it out. I extracted the slab
freelist quarantine from <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/kasan.html">KASAN</a> functionality and called it <code>SLAB_QUARANTINE</code>.</p>

<p>If this feature is enabled, freed allocations are stored in the quarantine
queue, where they wait to be actually freed. So there should be no way for them
to be instantly reallocated and overwritten by UAF exploits.
In other words, with <code>SLAB_QUARANTINE</code>, the kernel allocator behaves like so:</p>

<p>On August 13, <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/08/13/7">I sent</a> the first early PoC to LKML and started deeper research of
its security properties.</p>



<p>For researching the security properties of the kernel heap quarantine, I developed
two <code>lkdtm</code> tests (<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/7">code is available here</a>).</p>

<p>The first test is called <code>lkdtm_HEAP_SPRAY</code>. It allocates and frees an object
from a separate <code>kmem_cache</code> and then allocates 400,000 similar objects.
In other words, this test attempts an original heap spraying technique for UAF
exploitation:</p>

        <span>...</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>spray_addrs</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>addr</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>pr_info</span><span>(</span><span>"FAIL: attempt %lu: freed object is reallocated</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>);</span>
            <span>break</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
    
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>SPRAY_LENGTH</span><span>)</span>
        <span>pr_info</span><span>(</span><span>"OK: original heap spraying hasn't succeeded</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If <code>CONFIG_SLAB_QUARANTINE</code> is disabled, the freed object is instantly
reallocated and overwritten:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  # echo HEAP_SPRAY &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT
   lkdtm: Performing direct entry HEAP_SPRAY
   lkdtm: Allocated and freed spray_cache object 000000002b5b3ad4 of size 333
   lkdtm: Original heap spraying: allocate 400000 objects of size 333...
   lkdtm: FAIL: attempt 0: freed object is reallocated
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If <code>CONFIG_SLAB_QUARANTINE</code> is enabled, 400,000 new allocations don't overwrite
the freed object:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  # echo HEAP_SPRAY &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT
   lkdtm: Performing direct entry HEAP_SPRAY
   lkdtm: Allocated and freed spray_cache object 000000009909e777 of size 333
   lkdtm: Original heap spraying: allocate 400000 objects of size 333...
   lkdtm: OK: original heap spraying hasn't succeeded
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That happens because pushing an object through the quarantine requires <strong>both
allocating and freeing memory</strong>. Objects are released from the quarantine as
new memory is allocated, but only when the quarantine size is over the limit.
And the quarantine size grows when more memory is freed up.</p>

<p>That's why I created the second test, called <code>lkdtm_PUSH_THROUGH_QUARANTINE</code>.
It allocates and frees an object from a separate <code>kmem_cache</code> and then performs
<code>kmem_cache_alloc()+kmem_cache_free()</code> for that cache 400,000 times.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>addr</span> <span>=</span> <span>kmem_cache_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>spray_cache</span><span>,</span> <span>GFP_KERNEL</span><span>);</span>

        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>push_addr</span> <span>==</span> <span>addr</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>pr_info</span><span>(</span><span>"Target object is reallocated at attempt %lu</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>);</span>

    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This test effectively pushes the object through the heap quarantine and
reallocates it after it returns back to the allocator freelist:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, the number of the allocations needed for overwriting
the vulnerable object is almost the same. That would be good for stable
UAF exploitation and should not be allowed.
That's why I developed <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/6"><strong>quarantine randomization</strong></a>. This randomization
required very small hackish changes to the heap quarantine mechanism.</p>

<p>The heap quarantine stores objects in batches. On startup, all
quarantine batches are filled by objects. When the quarantine shrinks,
I randomly choose and free half of objects from a randomly chosen batch.
The randomized quarantine then releases the freed object at an unpredictable moment:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 107884
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 265641
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 100030
   lkdtm: Target object is NOT reallocated in 400000 attempts
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 204731
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 359333
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 289349
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 119893
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 225202
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 87343
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, this randomization alone would not stop the attacker:
the quarantine stores the attacker's data (the payload) in the sprayed objects!
This means the reallocated and overwritten vulnerable object contains the payload
until the next reallocation (very bad!).</p>

<p>This makes it important to <strong>erase heap objects before placing them in the heap quarantine</strong>.
Moreover, filling them with zeros gives a chance to detect UAF
accesses to non-zero data for as long as an object stays in the quarantine (nice!).
That functionality already exists in the kernel, it's called <code>init_on_free</code>.
<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/5">I integrated it</a> with <code>CONFIG_SLAB_QUARANTINE</code> as well.</p>

<p>During that work I found a bug: in <code>CONFIG_SLAB</code>, <code>init_on_free</code> happens too
late. Heap objects go to the KASAN quarantine while still "dirty." I provided the fix
in a <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/4">separate patch</a>.</p>

<p>For a deeper understanding of the heap quarantine's inner workings, I provided an <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/8">additional
patch</a>, which contains verbose debugging (not for merge).
It's very helpful, see the output example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>   quarantine: PUT 508992 to tail batch 123, whole sz 65118872, batch sz 508854
   quarantine: whole sz exceed max by 494552, REDUCE head batch 0 by 415392, leave 396304
   quarantine: data level in batches:
     0 - 77%
     1 - 108%
     2 - 83%
     3 - 21%
   ...
     125 - 75%
     126 - 12%
     127 - 108%
   quarantine: whole sz exceed max by 79160, REDUCE head batch 12 by 14160, leave 17608
   quarantine: whole sz exceed max by 65000, REDUCE head batch 75 by 218328, leave 195232
   quarantine: PUT 508992 to tail batch 124, whole sz 64979984, batch sz 508854
   ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The heap quarantine <code>PUT</code> operation you see in this output happens during kernel memory freeing.
The heap quarantine <code>REDUCE</code> operation happens during kernel memory allocation, if the quarantine
size limit is exceeded. The kernel objects released from the heap quarantine return to the allocator
freelist – they are actually freed.
In this output, you can also see that on <code>REDUCE</code>, the quarantine releases some part of
a randomly chosen object batch (see the <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/6">randomization patch</a> for more details).</p>



<p>I made <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/10/01/7">brief performance tests</a> of the quarantine PoC on real hardware and in virtual machines:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/compilers/1.png" alt="Compilers security report"></p><p>Online compilers are a handy tool to save time and resources for coders, and are freely available for a variety of programming languages. They are useful for learning a new language and developing simple programs, such as the ubiquitous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program">“Hello World”</a> exercise. I often use online compilers when I am out, so that I don’t have to worry about locating and downloading all of the resources myself.</p><p>Since these online tools are essentially remote compilers with a web interface, I realized that I might be able to take remote control of the machines through command injection. My research identified a common weakness in many compilers: inadequate sanitization of user-submitted code prior to execution. My analysis revealed that this lack of input filtration enables exploits that an hacker can use to take control of the machine or deliberately cause it to crash.</p><p>A clever attacker can exploit built-in C functions and POSIX libraries to gain control over the computer hosting the online compiler. Commands like <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/execl">execl()</a>, <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/system">system()</a>, and <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/getenv">GetEnv()</a> can be used to probe the target machine operating system and run any command on its built-in shell.</p><p>I wanted to write this article to remind how sandboxed environment are important when shipping an application such as this!</p><h2 id="vulnerability-description">Vulnerability description</h2><p>In this section, I will introduce the reader to the vulnerability explaining both theory and practice processes.</p><h3 id="gaining-access">Gaining access</h3><p>In several of the C/C++ compilers that I analyzed, the GetEnv(), system(), functions allow an attacker to study and execute any command on the remote machine. The GetEnv() function allows a hacker to learn information about the machine that is otherwise concealed from the web interface, such as the username and OS version.</p><p>Once this information is revealed, the attacker can begin testing various exploits to achieve privilege escalation and gain access to a root shell. For example, the system() command can be used to execute malicious code and access sensitive data such as logs, website files, etc.</p><p>Since the exploit I discovered involves inserting hostile commands to gain control of an unwitting machine, this attack vector is classified as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_injection">code injection</a> vulnerability.</p><h3 id="maintaining-control">Maintaining control</h3><p>If hacker tries to run the online compiler every time they want to send a new command, the attack would leave an obvious trace, and the resource use might draw attention to the suspicious activity. These obstacles can be conveniently sidestepped by using the execl() function, which allows the user to specify any arbitrary program to replace the current process. An attacker can gain access to the machine’s built-in shell by invoking the execl() function to replace the current process with <code>/bin/sh</code>, with catastrophic implications.</p><p>Many compilers allow input from the browser, in which case the hacker can craft a program to relay input commands to the shell of the compromised machine. Once the hacker uses <code>execl()</code> to open a shell via browser, they can simply operate the remote machine using <code>system()</code> to inject various instructions. This avoids the need to run the compiler each time the attacker wishes to explore or exploit the compromised machine.</p><h3 id="implications">Implications</h3><p>A hacker that obtains shell access in this way gains access to files and services typically protected from outside users. The attacker now has many options at their disposal for exploiting the machine and/or wreaking havoc; how they proceed will depend on their tools and motives.</p><p>If the attacker wishes to crash the target machine, they can achieve this by (mis)using the fork() function, which creates <a href="https://serhack.me/articles/introduction-to-monerov-and-its-inherent-risks/"><del>a new cryptocurrency</del></a> clone of the current process. A fork() function placed within a while (true) loop will execute indefinitely, repeatedly cloning the process to greedily consumed precious RAM memory. This rapid uncontrolled use of resources will overwhelm the machine, causing a self-DOS (denial of service attack).</p><p>Instead of maliciously crashing a machine, an attacker may wish to monetize their illicit access. This can be accomplished by injecting a cryptocurrency miner, which will generate funds for the attacker at the expense of the victim’s computational resources and electric bill. My analysis showed that this maneuver allows useful exploitation of online compilers that successfully stymied other attacks by sandboxing the environment or adopting more advanced techniques to limit file access.</p><h3 id="theory">Theory</h3><p>This section documents the commands used to gain and maintain access to the online compiler. These functions require the unistd.h and stdlib.h libraries.</p><h4 id="execl">execl()</h4><h5 id="declaration">Declaration</h5><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>int</span> <span>execl</span>(<span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span>pathname, <span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span>arg, ...);</code></pre></div><p>Parameters:</p><ul><li><p><strong>pathname</strong> - char*, the name of the program</p></li><li><p><strong>arg</strong> - char*, arguments passed to the program, specified by _pathname_</p></li></ul><h6 id="description">Description</h6><p>The execl() function replaces the current process with a new process.

}</code></pre></div><h3 id="solutions-sandboxed-environment">Solutions: sandboxed environment</h3><p>Thankfully, most of the risks highlighted above can be mitigated relatively easily. Access to protected files and services can be prevented by creating a secure sandbox for the application. This minimizes the potential for collateral damage and inappropriate data access, but will not prevent some attacks such as cryptocurrency miner injection. In order to avoid these “mining” attacks, the sandbox should have limited resources and it should be able to reboot itself every 10 minutes.</p><p>To eliminate the underlying weakness, the libraries could be recompiled without the particular exploitable functions. An attacker cannot gain a foothold if the execl() and system() are removed or disabled by recompiling libraries.</p><p>In addition to this, tools such as <a href="https://docker.com/">Docker</a> might be used to create a sandboxed environment. A sandbox is a mechanism to run applications in a limited space. It usually provides a restricted and controlled set of resources to the program that needs to be tested, such as a restricted area of memory or a set of limited system calls; normally, network access, the ability to inspect the host system or read from input devices, are disabled or highly restricted.</p><p>At the time of my search, I found at least two compilers with a non-sandboxed environment. I contacted the managers and they resolved in less than a week. For others I verified that they were actually under a sandboxed environment. Injected scripts were immediately identified and the “malicious” user was banned.</p><p>Do you have any suggestions for my articles?

    <p>Firestore is Google’s serverless document database offering.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-serverless-mean">What does serverless mean?</h2>

<p>Serverless means that we don’t have to worry about managing the servers on which the database runs. All the management is done automatically by Google. The database will scale up or down depending on the demand.</p>

<h2 id="whats-a-document-database">What’s a document database?</h2>

<p>A document database is a non-relational database that stores data in a semi-structured format. A common format used by many document databases is JSON.</p>

<p>In a relational database, we usually create tables with a defined structure (columns and types). In a document database, it’s not necessary to specify the different columns.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>

<p>There are two concepts we need to be familiar with to model our Firestore database: <code>documents</code> and <code>collections</code>.</p>

<p>A <code>document</code> is similar to a JSON object. Each top level attribute is called a <code>field</code>. A document can’t be bigger than 1MB.</p>

<p>A <code>collection</code> is a group of documents. We can think of it as a table without a schema, just a name.</p>

<p>A <code>document</code> can point to a <code>collection</code>, and <code>documents</code> in that <code>collection</code> can point to other <code>collections</code>.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-database">Creating a database</h2>

<p>When we talk about creating a database, we are referring to making it possible to create <code>collections</code> and <code>documents</code> in Google Cloud. At the time of this writing, Firestore databases come in 2 flavors:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Native mode</code> - Recommended for mobile apps or browsers</li>
  <li><code>Datastore mode</code> - Recommended for back-end servers</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently there is no way to create a database in <code>datastore mode</code> using <code>gcloud</code> cli, so we need to do it from the cloud console. If we want to create a database in native mode we can use:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>gcloud firestore databases create
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This command triggers some initial setup that might take a few minutes.</p>

<p>Once we choose the mode for a Google Cloud project, it can’t be changed. If we want to change it, we would need to create a new project and create another database there.</p>

<h2 id="writing-data">Writing data</h2>

<p>In relational databases we need to define our tables and schemas in advance. That’s not the case on Firebase. Documents are created in collections. If a collection doesn’t exist, it will be created on the fly.</p>

<p>Clients exist for various programming languages. We’re going to use Golang in this article.</p>

<p>Note that <code>GcpCredentialsFile</code> must be a valid service account key with permissions for Firestore (roles/datastore.user), and <code>ProjectId</code> should be the id of the project where the database lives.</p>

<p>We can run our program with:</p>



<p>The <code>Set</code> operation creates a new record or replaces an existing one. The <code>Doc("1")</code> part of the command tells firestore to use <code>1</code> as a document identifier. There can’t be two documents with the same identifier in a collection.</p>

<p>It’s also possible to tell firestore to <code>merge</code> an existing document instead of replacing it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>client</span><span>.</span><span>Collection</span><span>(</span><span>"tacos"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>Doc</span><span>(</span><span>"1"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>Set</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>,</span> <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>interface</span><span>{}{</span>

<span>},</span> <span>firestore</span><span>.</span><span>MergeAll</span><span>)</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each document we write is represented by a path. For the document we just created, this will be the path:</p>

<p>In the example above, we used <code>==</code>, but we can also use:</p>

<p>It’s also possible to use <code>limit</code> to specify how many documents to return:</p>

<h2 id="indexes">Indexes</h2>

<p>A very brief note about indexes, because they work differently than in other databases. There are two types of indexes in firestore, <code>single-field indexes</code> and <code>composite indexes</code>.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, <code>single-field indexes</code> are indexes made of a single field. Firestore automatically creates <code>single-field indexes</code> for all the fields in a document, so we don’t have to worry about creating these ourselves.</p>

<p>As opposed to <code>single-field indexes</code>, <code>composite indexes</code> are not created automatically. These are indexes formed by more than one field and need to be defined before they can be used.</p>



<p>This article scratched the surface of what can be done with <code>Firestore</code>. There are many things about querying that I didn’t cover, as well as other interesting topics like transactions and arrays. I’m planning on using it in a project, so hopefully I’ll be writing about these topics in the future.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Integrating security as a part of application development is desirable, but it's often forgotten or dismissed in practice. Dependabot is a Github feature that will help you keep all your dependencies invulnerable and up-to-date, and you can enable it in just a few clicks!</p>
</section><article><section><p>I've often been told that integrating security as a role and shared responsibility in application development is important. Yet, in my experience, security is frequently given a low priority by developers. Progress is primarily estimated by looking at an application's new features, and security measures are considered invasive and complicating to our day-to-day-work. Luckily, there are tools that requires little effort to increase our focus on security, such as Github's Dependabot  </p>
<h2>What is Dependabot?</h2>
<p>Simply put, Dependabot is a tool designated to keep dependencies secure and up-to-date. How it works can be summarized in the following three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dependabot scans your dependency files for outdated or insecure dependencies.</li>
<li>Dependabot creates pull requests for dependencies that need an update.</li>
<li>You review, test and merge Dependabot’s changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Following Github's acquisition of Dependabot in May 2019, the feature was added natively to Github. With only a few clicks, Dependabot can easily be enabled from the Github dashboard, and help you keep your application’s dependencies up-to-date.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Enough background information, let us talk about how to get started. Github's security settings can be configured for an <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-organization">entire organization</a>, applying to all of the organization’s repositories, or it can be configured <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-repository">per repository</a>. Which is the better option depends on your context. If you are the owner of your organization and it is desirable to enable the security features across all of its repositories, obviously it would be less time consuming to configure this on the organization level, rather than for each repository individually. However, if you are a part of a large organization with lots of teams and projects, enabling Dependabot on the repository level might be the only option.</p>
<p>In this example, we will enable Dependabot on a single repository. In your repository, there should be a button titled “Security”. Note that the security option is only visible to administrators, hence it will not be visible if you don't have the admin role in the repository. </p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/kScW0pN/screenshot-2020-11-21-at-18-06-01-1.png" alt="To enable Dependabot, click on the &quot;Security&quot; button."></p>
<p>In the security overview, there is a row titled “Dependabot alerts”. If not already activated, there should be a button to “Enable Dependabot alerts”. Click it. You should now have three options that you can enable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dependency graph</li>
<li>Dependabot alerts</li>
<li>Dependabot security updates</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dependency graph</h3>
<p>The dependency graph is a summary of the manifest and lock files stored in a repository. Enabling this feature is a prerequisite for the other options, as Dependabot requires access to the dependency graph in order to create alerts and updates.</p>
<h3>Dependabot alerts</h3>
<p>The alerts allows Dependabot to notify you when it finds a weakness. This is probably the key feature that you are here for. When activated, the number of unresolved alerts is highlighted in the "Security" button that we previously clicked. On the security tab, the alerts highlighting currently outdated dependencies are listed. By clicking on an alert, you will find more details on it, such as a description of the vulnerability and in what version of the dependency it was patched.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/VMrM5Kh/screenshot-2020-11-16-at-19-59-16.png" alt="Security: Dependabot alerts" title="Unresolved Dependabot alerts are listed in the repository."></p>
<h3>Dependabot security updates</h3>
<p>By enabling the third option, the security updates, whenever a vulnerable dependency is discovered, Dependabot will try to fix it. If it is possible to upgrade the vulnerable dependency without disrupting the dependency graph of the repository, Dependabot will generate a pull request bringing the dependency up-to-date. The pull request is given a compatibility score indicating whether the update could cause breaking changes. The number is based on the percentage of tests in public repositories that passed when performing the same update.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/2vr3GBb/dependabot-pull-request.png" alt="Example pull request generated by Dependabot" title="A pull request generated by Dependabot"></p>
<p>Unfortunately, in my experience working with Dependabot, more often than not, it is unable to generate pull requests. This is often because the source of the vulnerability is an indirect or transitive dependency. The Dependabot documentation states that <em>“(...) security updates are triggered only for dependencies that are specified in a manifest or lock file. Dependabot is unable to update an indirect or transitive dependency that is not explicitly defined.”.</em> This means that even though Dependabot is able to perform some automatic updates, you should expect to perform most of the updates yourself - for now.</p>
<p>Even though Dependabot is unable to perform automated dependency updates most of the time, I would recommend enabling the feature. Occasionally it <em>will</em> be able to create the pull request for you, and you'll have saved yourself a couple of minutes that you can spend on something else.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/xXLhGLr/dependabot-pr-error.png" alt="Error message: Dependabot cannot update to the required version" title="More often than not, Dependabot is unable to generate a pull request"></p>
<p>If you already have established an effective process to update your project's dependencies, Dependabot might not be able to help you. Otherwise, you should definitely give it a try. It's free, it takes minimal effort to set up and - no matter how you use it - it's a better option than not monitoring your dependencies in any way.</p></section></article></div>]]>

<p>Reggie Fowler, the former NFL minority owner linked to missing Tether and Bitfinex funds, owes his defense team more than $600,000, according to a new<a href="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/106df130-d8cc-418e-bbc0-8e46715e7b0a.pdf"> court filing</a> on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fowler’s lawyers <a href="https://amycastor.com/2020/11/12/reginald-fowlers-lawyers-want-to-quit-did-he-neglect-to-pay-them/">want to drop out of the case</a> due to nonpayment, but they need to get permission from the court first.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://amycastor.com/2020/11/24/reggie-fowler-hoodwinks-his-own-defense-team/">Last we left off</a>, U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter ordered attorneys at law firm Hogan Lovells—also representing defense lawyer Scott Rosenblum at Rosenblum Schwartz &amp; Fry—to file three versions of a sealed letter dated Nov. 18.</p>



<p>The public version—redacting what should not be revealed to the government or the public—discloses more details on the lawyers’ frustrations with a client who perpetually strings them along.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hogan Lovells attorneys James McGovern and Michael Hefter initially asked for a $25,000 retainer in late 2018 when they first met with their client. Fowler only ever paid the retainer, and two years later, he now owes them $600,000.</p>



<p>His defense team believed all the stories he told them that he was swimming in money, so they weren’t too concerned—at first.</p>



<p>“From the very inception of this matter, we have been led to believe that Mr. Fowler is a high net worth individual with substantial assets, which would allow him to pay his legal bills with little hardship,” the lawyers said in their letter to the judge. </p>



<p>Hogan Lovells started working with Fowler on October 18, 2018. They had their first meeting with him on Nov. 8, 2018, around the time Fowler was initially contacted by the FBI. </p>



<p>“When we agreed to represent Mr. Fowler, it was our understanding that he had been targeted by cryptocurrency businessmen seeking to take advantage of Mr. Fowler’s personal balance sheet as a means of transacting cryptocurrency transactions without drawing the attention of bank compliance officers or regulators,” they said. </p>



<p>Fowler was later arrested in Chandler, Arizona, on<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/arizona-man-and-israeli-woman-charged-connection-providing-shadow-banking-services"> </a>April 30, 2019. (<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/arizona-man-and-israeli-woman-charged-connection-providing-shadow-banking-services">DoJ press release and indictment</a>.)</p>



<p>After his release in May <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/05/11/reginald-fowler-man-at-center-of-cryptocurrency-scheme-out-on-5-million-bail/">on $5 million bail</a>, Fowler hired Scott Rosenblum to join the defense team. Rosenblum asked for a $275,000 retainer and an additional $85,000 per week retainer, if the case went to trial.&nbsp;Rosenblum received a partial retainer of $100,000, which Hogan Lovells notes that Fowler paid “while he had several unpaid, overdue invoices for legal services issued by Hogan Lovells.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, Fowler paid another lawyer (unnamed) in Portugal in full for her services. He also paid international law firm Reed Smith LLP for&nbsp;services rendered in 2018.</p>



<p>“The fact that other attorneys had received payments from Mr. Fowler for their services led us reasonably to believe that Mr. Fowler’s representations to us that he would pay our bills was truthful,” the lawyers said.</p>



<p>In the second half of 2019, the lawyers were diligent about contacting Fowler for money. Each time they reached out, he told them payment was imminent and that “transactions or business deals that would fund the payment of our fees were in process”—but he never paid him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In February, following a plea bargain that went awry and a superseding indictment, the defense team realized the case would likely go to trial, requiring a substantial amount of work, and still no check from their client. </p>



<p>Fowler has ample funds, they said, including “$10 million in real estate that is unencumbered and could have been liquidated or monetized at any point during the past two years.” His refusal to pay, the lawyers added, has “led to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.”</p>



<p>The government has till Dec. 8 to respond and replies are due Dec. 11.</p>

December 1, 2020 | https://functional.christmas/2020/2 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://functional.christmas/2020/2">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main id="main-content"><article><div><section><p>This is an opinionated post. Consider yourself warned. You will probably disagree with at least some of it, and that is completely fine. The important part is the thought process – don’t just read through it and agree or disagree, think about <em>what</em> you agree or disagree with and <em>why</em>. Becoming aware of these things is valuable: once you become aware of why you dislike something, you can start doing something about it.</p>
</section><article><section><p>Over the years, I have noticed there is a small set of features I value more than others in programming languages. These features allow me to express myself in a concise and clear manner, makes my code more readable, and minimizes the amounts of errors I make. They are not "magical" in any way. Far from it. Rather, they are more.. fundamental aspects of the progamming language itself. Let’s dive in!</p>
<h2>Expressive type system</h2>
<p>Types help me reason. Explicitly typed code communicates intent better, and is easier to navigate without losing context completely. Type systems comes in a variety of flavors, ranging from the most simple ones to more advanced systems with gradual typing, dependent types, type classes, and so on. Although I personally prefer more advanced ones, I believe this is more of a subjective topic. And of less importance, really. The main benefit of type systems exists in even the simplest ones: increased safety and readability. Remember: the compiler is your friend – the more it can verify, the better!</p>
<h2>Type inference</h2>
<p>I was a bit unsure if this point had its place in this blog post. On one hand, I feel its more of a convenience feature than strictly neccessary. On the other, an overly chatty and boilerplaty type system can cause more harm than good –&nbsp;if your business logic drowns in types, it’s too far in the wrong direction. Java, around the 1.5 era, is an example of this. In addition, type inference itself is a a double-egded sword. If the compiler inferes a different type than what you would have thought, it can be quite hard to spot where the actual error is. This is the reason some languages and communities define best practices around type inference, like being explicit in function signatures. Anyway. When I find that perfect spot between explicit types and inferred types, it just makes me really happy.</p>
<h2>Algebraic data types</h2>
<p>I remember the first time I enountered sum types. My first response was «but.. Isn’t this just some kind of enums?». I can kind of see why I thought that, but I feel this is a limiting way of approaching them. Where enums helps me limit valid values, algebraic data types is so much more. It enables me to model my domain and state in a precise and correct manner, and makes illegal states «impossible». This didn’t really become clear to me until I went back to Java. I find modelling without them cumbersome and hard, and sometimes even end up in situations where I can’t avoid impossible states. Few things are more confusing than finding the comment «this can’t happen» in a branch of someones code.</p>
<h2>First class functions</h2>
<p>I don’t even understand why this is subject to discussion anymore, but functions should be treated just like any other value <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> in a programming language. Returning functions and accepting functions as parameters is a fundamental feature to create abstractions and solve problems with composition. This just isn’t up for debate – I would take first class functions over any other feature any day of the week!</p>
<p><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> – I use the term "value" loosely here. I don’t mean to debate value types, reference types, and pass by value or reference. Those are implementation details. The point is to see what advantages you get when a language treats simple values and functions the same. </p>
<h2>Functional Programming</h2>
<p>Functional programming taught me to value these features. Sure, you will find imperative languages with these features as well, but they never feel like a core feature of the language. Even Java comes with some sort of primitive type inference these days, but it mostly feels tacked onto the language.</p>
<p>With some notable exceptions (looking at you, LISP), these are core features in all functional programming languages I use. They make my day better, so I would think hard before adopting a language without them these days.</p>
<p>Which feature do you miss or disagree with the most?</p></section></article></div></article></main></div></div>]]>

<p>
As an archaeologist, Florian Huber is in the truest sense of the word with all waters. He searched for ancient Mayan antiquities in the flooded caves of the Yucatán, and dived to the bottom of fjords and deep alpine lakes. Again and again, however, the Kiel underwater researcher was drawn to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, where he tracked down wrecks or examined flora and fauna together with biologists.
</p>
<p>
It was here, of all places, that the well-traveled researcher made his most exciting discovery. Huber was actually working with two colleagues in the Geltinger Bucht, not far from Flensburg, in the service of environmental protection. The divers looked for ghost nets, abandoned fishing nets that become deadly traps for marine animals at the bottom.
</p>
<p>
From on board the “Mola Mola”, a nearly eight-meter-long motor catamaran, the researchers systematically scanned the sea floor with sonar. If the system detects a disused network or another object on the ground, the tracking device receives conspicuous sound pulses. The divers then slip into their suits, strap on their compressed air cylinders and drop backwards from the ship’s railing into the cold water to check.

  <div>
    <p>I’ve been spending an unreasonable amount of time trying to understanding performance jitters in a C++ application I’m working on. I have been measuring the time taken to execute a physics update as part of a graphics loop, something like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>update</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Need to analyze performance of this function:
</span><span></span>    <span>step_physics</span><span>();</span>

    <span>// Regular OpenGL drawing stuff, glBuffer etc
</span><span></span>    <span>draw</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I’m interested in optimizing the physics step, so I instrument it using <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono"><code>std::chrono</code></a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>update</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>using</span> <span>namespace</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>chrono</span><span>;</span>

    <span>auto</span> <span>start</span> <span>=</span> <span>high_resolution_clock</span><span>::</span><span>now</span><span>();</span>
    <span>step_physics</span><span>();</span>
    <span>duration</span><span>&lt;</span><span>double</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>elapsed</span> <span>=</span> <span>high_resolution_clock</span><span>::</span><span>now</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>start</span><span>;</span>
    <span>double</span> <span>physics_time</span> <span>=</span> <span>elapsed</span><span>.</span><span>count</span><span>();</span>

    <span>// Regular OpenGL drawing stuff, glBuffer etc
</span><span></span>    <span>draw</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here’s what time taken looks like:</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://karthikkaranth.me/img/blog/performance-benchmarking-beware-frequency-scaling/time_jitter.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>That’s a terrifying amount of jitter! Many dead ends and experiments later, I noticed that the performance stabilized when I started <em>drawing more things</em> to understand the problem. Turns out, the jitters were a result of <em>not doing enough work</em> in the draw call!</p>

<p>Operating systems typically employ some form of <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CPU_frequency_scaling">CPU frequency scaling</a> to save power when the system isn’t doing much work. The default governor on my system would keep the CPU at a low-power low-frequency mode, and dynamically increase it when the system load increases.</p>

<p>My application ran at 60FPS(about 16.67ms per frame). Since the update took much less than that overall, the process would sleep till the next frame. The default CPU governor <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CPU_frequency_scaling#Scaling_governors">powersave</a> would keep the CPU at a lower frequency because it sees the process mostly sleeping! During the update function however, the frequency would be scaled. This caused massive fluctuations in the recorded benchmarks!</p>

<p>Also, I should note that this was a symptom of improper benchmarking: I knew that the performance was stable if I simply ran the physics updates and didn’t draw anything. :( This entire ordeal was an attempt to understand why drawing would cause such massive differences in performance!</p>

<p>To verify this, I <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/855744">switched the governor</a> to performance:</p>

<![CDATA[The 25 Best Episodes of This American Life]]>

December 1, 2020 | https://podcastreview.org/list/best-episodes-of-this-american-life/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://podcastreview.org/list/best-episodes-of-this-american-life/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span>F</span></span>irst broadcast in November 1995, <em>This American Life</em> is the most influential precursor to narrative podcasting as it exists today. Over the last 25 years, the show founded and led by Ira Glass has built a vast network of producers and writers who have set standards across all genres of audio production. Two of the biggest names in the podcasting boom — <em>Serial</em>’s Sarah Koenig and Gimlet Media’s Alex Blumberg — were deeply involved with the show’s golden age. Many other producers from that period: Starlee Kine, Brian Reed, Hillary Frank, Scott Carrier, Jonathan Goldstein, and former intern PJ Vogt, to name just a few, have gone on to create acclaimed podcasts of their own.</p><p>What makes a good <em>This American Life</em> story? The show’s <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/about/submissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">submissions page</a> narrows it down to two principles: “There are characters in some situation, and a conflict,” and “[the] stories raise some bigger question or issue, some universal thing to think about.” But I would argue that the key ingredient is the contributor. The variety of styles on display in <em>This American Life </em>has separated the program from a traditional newsmagazine, whether that be <em>60 Minutes</em> or one found in print. And so, to make a list of the best episodes of <em>This American Life,</em> is to spotlight the work of the many staff and producers who make the show.</p><p>Surveying the following list, two things become apparent. First, episodes 300 to 400 (released from roughly 2006 to 2010) indeed constituted a kind of “golden age” for the show. During this period, production of <em>This American Life</em> moved from Chicago to New York (on account of the show’s <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/node/43664" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brief experimentation with television</a>), and the program became a force beyond itself. While much of the show’s first 10 years turned around the show’s home base of Chicago, once in New York, the show went global. It might be that no one takes you seriously until you’ve been at work for a decade, or it might just be that this was the moment Gen X became a silent majority of the culture industry. There was a political dimension to this: as the Bush administration tripped over itself in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and the follies of the Iraq and Afghan Wars became ever more apparent, <em>This American Life</em> was perfectly positioned to reach into the heart of these major stories and record the shifting ground under life in these United States.</p><p>The second fact is that we like long episodes. During that same five-year period, <em>This American Life</em> began to earn its reputation for blockbuster, hour-long narratives that would carry it into the 2010s. Some of these episodes — “The Giant Pool of Money,” “#1 Party School” among them — are so legendary that one can now forget that the show’s bread and butter has always been its act-based structure. The power of this method, one which many podcasts, due to their niche focuses, can never quite live up to, is to find disperse stories on a theme and situate them together in a way that makes them resonate in new ways.</p><p>This resonance gives these stories, some of them goofy, nerdy, or downright silly, the power to reshape one’s feelings. While on the surface <em>This American Life</em> can fall prey to the kind of neoliberal ephemera people lambast public radio for, underneath there is a radical current that infuses many of the episodes that we’ve chosen here. The program can be a one-hour chapter of <em>The People’s History</em> delivered to radio each week. It puts the faults and frailties of the U.S. on naked display, stripped of the power, prestige, and distance that older and more traditional mediators dress them in. It is for this reason, and the ones listed below, that we find <em>This American Life</em> to be one of the greatest American journalism projects. <em>– Brendan Mattox</em></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/15/dawn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15: Dawn</a></strong></p><p>An early highlight of <em>This American Life</em> is “Dawn,” the episode first to give the entire hour over to a single contributor. Master storyteller and magazine journalist Jack Hitt’s work holds a strong influence over the first decade of the program. “Dawn” follows Hitt as he interviews old friends and family in Charlotte about a mysterious neighbor. Fans of the podcast <em>S-Town</em> will find much to love here, as the Faulkneresque story of the end of The Old South yields to a story about sexuality, gender, and the way that media inserts itself into the stories of our lives.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/61/fiasco-1997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">61: Fiasco!</a></strong></p><p>One of <em>This American Life</em>’s most rerun episodes, “Fiasco!” is a collection of masterful debacles. Everything goes wrong, at least once in a while. When it does, you can only hope someone is there to record the wreckage. A community theater’s attempt to dazzle in their production of <em>Peter Pan </em>shatters the fourth wall and a rookie cop succumbs to a devious foe (a squirrel). Each of the episode’s four acts investigates a doomed, hilarious series of errors.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/80/running-after-antelope" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">80: Running After Antelope</a></strong></p><p>The legend about TAL contributor Scott Carrier (later explored in Carrier’s own podcast <em><a href="https://homebrave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home of the Brave</a></em>) is that he started making radio by hitchhiking, cross-country, from his home in Utah to the NPR headquarters in Washington, D.C. Arriving on a Saturday, he asked the first <em>Weekend Edition</em> producer who would listen to teach him how to make radio. Carrier is fiercely partisan, an outsider in every possible sense, and keenly unafraid to burn bridges. He writes like Hemingway, with brief language, quick movement, and constant grappling with the more toxic angles of masculinity. He can sound, at times, both dangerous and uniquely tuned to an unknown rhythm. All of these traits are on display in “Running After Antelope,” a 40-minute narrative of a decade-long attempt to chase down an antelope on foot, and how his desire to be “primitive” conflicted with the inexorable movement of time. Carrier would later get a full episode of <em>This American Life</em> dedicated to his work (<a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/181/the-friendly-man" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">181: The Friendly Man</a>).</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/109/notes-on-camp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">109: Notes on Camp</a></strong></p><p>This episode is yet another example of <em>This American Life</em>’s ability to turn a mundane topic — in this case, stories from summer camp — into a meaningful exploration of our values. The camp stories are funny and awkward, as we all were during our early adolescent summers. The scary stories, first kisses, and halting efforts at adulthood that appear throughout the episode answer at least some of the questions they pose about community and the importance of being together.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/172/24-hours-at-the-golden-apple" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">172: 24 Hours at the Golden Apple</a></strong></p><p>One of the hallmarks of <em>This American Life</em> is its commitment to telling stories of everyday life, eschewing the need for every episode to be relevant to the news. “24 Hours at the Golden Apple,” an episode with a rather literal title, shows this approach can be revelatory. In this episode, Glass and a few other producers spend the day at a local Chicago diner, from early morning until late into the night. We meet a regular who plays harmonica as the sun rises, a waitress who’s been working the night shift for the past 26 years, a pair of teen girls trying to corral friends to come join them at the diner, and many, many others.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/199/house-on-loon-lake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">199: House on Loon Lake</a></strong></p><p>In this engrossing episode, producer Adam Beckman tells the story of how, when he was eleven years old, he and two friends came across an abandoned house in the small town of Freedom, New Hampshire. The three boys dare each other to venture inside, and what they find — a crumbling newspaper, decaying clothes, old letters, and much more — hints that the home had been untouched for decades. From there, “a sort of real-life Hardy Boys mystery” commences, as Beckman and his friends work to uncover who lived in the house and the circumstances under which they had to leave.</p><p><strong><em>Want to receive our latest podcast reviews and episode recommendations via email? <a href="https://podcastreview.org/newsletter">Sign up here</a> for our weekly newsletter.</em></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/205/plan-b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">205: Plan B</a></strong></p><p>“Plan B”&nbsp;features stories from two of <em>This American Life</em>’s former contributors, John Hodgman and Jonathan Goldstein. In one sense, John Hodgman’s story, It’s Another Tequila Sunrise, is about Cuervo Man, Jose Cuervo’s Princeton-educated brand ambassador who seemingly exists to balance tequila shots on his head and be the life of the party. In another, it’s about fear and acceptance of who we are. Jonathan Goldstein faces similar considerations as he deals with his unexpected success as a telemarketer. Both segments wrap the discomfort of self-examination in the humor of Hodgman and Goldstein’s small absurdities.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/220/testosterone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">220: Testosterone</a></strong></p><p>The episode in which every <em>This American Life</em> crew member decides to measure their testosterone levels competition-style begins with Alex Blumberg’s quest to find out how much the hormone has shaped his life. Two excellent, extended interviews give this 2002 show its verve: one with a journalist whose body briefly stopped producing testosterone, one with a transgender man who noticed a series of astounding changes to his own thought patterns when he began testosterone injections. The episode doesn’t seek to prove anything, but hearing these two men, plus every TAL producer, try to understand how hormones inform their character is funny and fascinating.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/241/20-acts-in-60-minutes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">241: 20 Acts in 60 Minutes</a></strong></p><p>The entire cast of characters briefly guest star in the 2003 episode that abandoned the regular act-based structure for 20 mini-stories. Jonathan Goldstein tells a long joke. David Rakoff reveals his bad instincts. Starlee Kine finds the perfect punch line about low-level celebrity. David Sedaris finds out he’s been duped for years. Ira Glass discovers the mystery of Vienna Beef. The ultimate highlights of the experiment, Acts 6 and 20, tell two stories from separate juvenile detention centers.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/266/im-from-the-private-sector-and-im-here-to-help" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">266: I’m from the Private Sector and I’m Here to Help</a></strong></p><p>If one wants to pinpoint the shift of <em>This American Life</em> towards its current reputation for intensely original reporting, a strong contender is this 2004 report on the employees of Custer Battles, one of the many private security contractors to flood Iraq in the wake of the United States contentious (and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3661134.stm">illegal</a>) invasion in 2003.

              <h2>Youâ€™ve launched your new productâ€¦ Now what? Time to Get Selling! Hereâ€™s how...</h2>

<p>While the transition from initial product development to sales sounds easy enough, the shift is actually one of the biggest challenges for entrepreneurs and startups. After months of long, hard work developing your product, the actual launch feels like the finish line. In fact, the race has just begun. You finally have something to offer, so now itâ€™s time to get selling. Make it rain.</p>

<p>But, you have no idea how to make a light drizzle, let alone a rainstorm. You need to find people who want your product and are willing to pay for it. Beyond friends and family, how do you find people interested in what you offer? You need leads and there are tools that can help you find them.</p>

<p>Lead generation <em>(or lead gen, as many entrepreneurs call it)</em> is the process of locating prospects that might be interested in your product so that you can reach out, introduce your product and start to get people interested. It helps you to start selling, which you need to create revenues, keep the lights on, and, ultimately, grow.</p>

<p>Of course, lead-gen is the start of the selling process. The sales cycle can be quite involved, including lead nurturing and conversion, but letâ€™s focus on lead-gen for now.</p>

<h2>How Do You Generate Leads?</h2>

<p>It all starts with understanding your target customer. Who actually needs the product you offer? Who is experiencing the problem your product solves? Is this a solution for large corporations, medium-sized companies, or small, emerging businesses? Or perhaps it appeals to individuals, to families, to retired homeowners or bicycle commuters or Parkour-practicing pet owners. To be successful, start with one target. You can expand with other campaigns to broaden your revenue streams down the road, but for now, focus on one.</p>

<p>Whoâ€™s the decision-maker for this solution within the organization. If you are offering accounting software, for example, you might want to target the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and the financial team. For office cleaning products, youâ€™d want to reach office managers, and if itâ€™s an employee training program, youâ€™d target the HR team.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the sales team would seek out lists from organizations that reach the target audience -- often magazines or trade organizations. A list of CFO Magazine readers, for example, was the best way to reach leads who worked in finance. The rise of social media has changed this, providing new ways to interact with a target audience. Today, businesses need a better way to sell than simply making cold calls downs on a static list. You need dynamic solutions that find qualified leads and provide information that helps you sell better.</p>

<p>Fortunately, lead-gen has become automated and highly targeted. Drawing on lists, but also social information and data, lead-gen can provide a more detailed context to help you sell. Beyond finding CFOs who might want your product, look for a solution that helps you understand the preferences of each lead. What are the CFOâ€™s preferred social media channels? Is she active on LinkedIn? How long has she been the CFO? Does she belong to a professional organization? Is she quoted in business news articles?</p>

<p>To take advantage of these new techniques, look for Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solutions that can generate leads, provide rich information on each customer, and help you manage the experience throughout the entire customer lifecycle. While some stand-alone lead-gen applications can help, the integrated CRM approach will help you not only generate leads but convert them to loyal customers that can fuel your growth for years to come.</p>

<p>There are mM=any CRM solutions to choose from. The market leaders are effective for large, enterprise customers but are costly and can be overkill for small, emerging businesses. Seek out a CRM solution designed for start-ups and high-growth companies. You want a solution that will generate leads, help you start selling, and successfully move from pure product development to sales that will allow your company to survive and thrive â€” without the high cost or high-pressure upsell from the CRM provider.</p>

<p>Tapdesk is a CRM platform designed for companies as small as one solopreneur and is extremely effective for businesses with up to 250 users. Itâ€™s a solution designed to help startups get started, generate revenue, and begin to grow. It was built to make lead gen easy and straightforward, to help your company get selling.</p>

We are quickly embracing digital alternatives because they are more efficient and easy to use.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Holiday greetings are being written on WhatsApp or email because itâ€™s fast, grocery lists are written in a to-do app because itâ€™s convenient, and documents are being written in the cloud because itâ€™s collaborative. But the convenience has a downside.</span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><strong>People are gradually forgetting how to write.</strong></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span>Especially those whose languages depend on strokes and symbols like Chinese and Japanese. A </span><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxHskrqMqII" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">street-survey</a></span><span> by a popular YouTube channel, Asian Boss has showed that all of their Chinese interviewees have â€” to a certain extent â€” forgotten how to write certain words. A similar </span><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJNxPRBvRQg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">street-survey</a></span><span> by That Japanese Man Yuta on YouTube reported the same outcome with native Japanese people. The main reason? Keyboards.</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong><span><span>But is this a bad thing? Yes and no.</span></span></strong></span></span></p><p><span><span>Yes, because writing will be a lost art but most importantly, there are evidences that suggest writing have certain cognitive benefits.</span></span></p><p><span><span>However, as a language-learner, this speeds up the process of learning. Rather than learning how to write complex characters, learners will only need to learn how to recognize them. Vocabulary flashcards and reading exercises are sufficient and more practical to learn characters.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Since the world is becoming less reliant on pen and paper, there is no need for casual â€” or even serious â€” language learners to learn how to write. Take the Japanese language proficiency exams for instance. There is no written exam at all, from beginner to advanced tests. All you need to know is how to read and comprehend conversations.</span></span></p><p><span><span>I personally havenâ€™t used a pen for serious writing in years. I am also learning various languages, like Mandarin and Arabic, by reading and typing instead of writing. Am I declining cognitively? I donâ€™t think so. I exercise every day, eat moderately, and read abundantly. Surely, thatâ€™s enough.</span></span></p><p><span><span>How do you feel about this?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In this article, we are going to get AirDrop running on a Raspberry Pi 3 (not B+, unfortunately) running Rasbian Stretch.
While AirDrop itself implements a HTTP-based protocol (see <a href="https://owlink.org/code/">OpenDrop</a>), it uses a dedicated Wi-Fi based link layer called Apple Wireless Direct Link (AWDL). In order to use AirDrop, we’ll enable AWDL capabilities on the Raspberry Pi using <a href="https://owlink.org/code/">OWL</a>, our open AWDL implementation. OWL is implemented as user space program and requires a Wi-Fi card with working monitor mode and frame injection.</p>

<h2 id="enable-monitor-mode-with-frame-injection">Enable monitor mode with frame injection</h2>

<p>Since the BCM43430A1 Wi-Fi chip in the RPi3 does not support monitor mode out-of-the-box, we’ll use <a href="https://nexmon.org/">Nexmon</a> to patch the firmware.
The following steps are adapted from the project’s <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon/blob/master/README.md">README</a>.</p>

<p>First, we need to install some dependencies.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt update <span>&amp;&amp;</span> apt upgrade
<span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>raspberrypi-kernel-headers git <span>\</span>
                 libgmp3-dev gawk qpdf bison flex make
<span>sudo </span>apt remove wpasupplicant
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, we prepare Nexmon…</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon.git
<span>cd </span>nexmon
<span>touch </span>DISABLE_STATISTICS
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>… and compile required libraries and tools.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>su
<span>if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>!</span> <span>-f</span> /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libisl.so.10 <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span> <span>\</span>
   <span>cd </span>buildtools/isl-0.10/ <span>&amp;&amp;</span> ./configure <span>&amp;&amp;</span> make <span>&amp;&amp;</span> make <span>install</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>\</span>
   <span>ln</span> <span>-s</span> /usr/local/lib/libisl.so <span>\</span>
         /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libisl.so.10 <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>\</span>
   <span>cd</span> ../../ <span>;</span> <span>fi
</span><span>source </span>setup_env.sh
make
<span>cd </span>utilities/nexutil/ <span>&amp;&amp;</span> make <span>&amp;&amp;</span> make <span>install</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>cd</span> ../../
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We are now ready to build and install the monitor mode firmware patch.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>cd </span>patches/bcm43430a1/7_45_41_46/nexmon/
make
make backup-firmware
make install-firmware
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that the above step is only necessary for Wi-Fi chips/drivers where monitor mode and frame injection support is missing. Other chips using the ath9k driver such as the Atheros AR9280 work out-of-the-box. Since Nexmon does not offer frame injection for the BCM43455C0 chip yet, you currently cannot use OWL on a 3B+ model.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="install-owl">Install OWL</h2>

<p>Next, we are installing <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/owl">OWL</a>, our AWDL implementation. First, we need some libraries (libpcap, libev, and libnl).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>libpcap-dev libev-dev libnl-3-dev <span>\</span>
                 libnl-genl-3-dev libnl-route-3-dev
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, it should be as easy as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/seemoo-lab/owl.git
<span>cd </span>owl
git submodule update <span>--init</span>
<span>mkdir </span>build
<span>cd </span>build
cmake ..
make
<span>sudo </span>make <span>install</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="install-opendrop">Install OpenDrop</h2>

<p>In the last step, we’ll install our AirDrop-compatible <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/opendrop">OpenDrop</a> client and server.
Again, we need some dependencies:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>python3 python3-pip libjpeg-dev libopenjp2-7-dev
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, we can clone and install the software.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/seemoo-lab/opendrop.git
<span>sudo </span>pip3 <span>install</span> ./opendrop
</code></pre></div></div>

<div>
	<p><a href="https://owlink.org/assets/raspi-airdrop.png">
		<img title="Sending a file to a Raspberry Pi 3 via AirDrop" alt="Sending a file to a Raspberry Pi 3 via AirDrop" src="https://owlink.org/assets/raspi-airdrop.png">
	</a></p><p>Sending a file to a Raspberry Pi 3 via AirDrop</p>
</div>

<h2 id="receive-files-via-airdrop">Receive files via AirDrop</h2>

<p>Now that all tools are installed, we can start a test run and use the Raspberry Pi to receive files via AirDrop.</p>

<p>Since we use Nexmon to enable monitor mode, we need to manually enable monitor mode and set the correct Wi-Fi channel (the RPi3 only supports the 2.4 GHz band, so we’ll use channel 6).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>iw phy <span>`</span>iw dev wlan0 info | gawk <span>'/wiphy/ {printf "phy" $2}'</span><span>`</span> interface add mon0 <span>type </span>monitor
<span>sudo </span>ifconfig mon0 up
<span>sudo </span>nexutil <span>-k6</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, we start <code>owl</code> to enable frame reception via AWDL (option <code>-N</code> tells <code>owl</code> that the interface is already in monitor mode, you can add <code>-v</code> to increase the logging output).</p>



<p>In a second shell, we can start the <code>opendrop</code> receiver.</p>



<p>Now, when opening the sharing pane on an iOS device, a new receiver appears after a short delay and we can send files!</p>

But over time, Front has grown from being a product for a specific kind of workflow to being a tool that people use across organizations.</p><p>The fact is that most companies are still stuck in time from twenty years ago when it comes to managing how they triage, assign, and respond to all those emails. That's a big pain point, because as it turns out, a lot of the critical work that companies do takes place over email. </p><p>What Front has realized is that owning the orchestration and collaboration around email puts them in a position to “back into” $66B worth of vertical markets—CRM, project management, knowledge management, conversational marketing, and others.</p><p>To show the size of that opportunity and demonstrate the progress that Front has made towards its goal in this report, we aggregated all the public data out there on Front, then extrapolating and interpolating to fill in the gaps using backchannels to confirm our numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>We learned that Front, like Slack, has consumer-grade engagement, elite compounding revenue from their land and expand strategy, and increasingly broad adoption inside teams.</p><p>By focusing on external vs. internal communication, however, Front may also have a TAM that is several times as large as Slack's.</p><h2 id="front-s-roadmap-to--2b--4b--20b">Front's roadmap to $2B/$4B/$20B</h2><ul><li><strong>Our financial model values Front at $1.3B, with a price per share around $11.</strong> At their Series C in January, they were valued at $920M, or about $7.70~ per share.</li><li><strong>Front is currently trading on the secondary market between $7.25 and $9.00 per share.</strong> 5-year IRR for each scenario in our model ranges from 3% to 22% in the bear case, 22% to 46% in the base case, and 84% to 118% in the bull case.</li><li><strong>Front is like Slack for email</strong>. It is a multiplayer tool that lets teams better communicate—via chatting with other team members within the context of a personal or shared inbox—and coordinate—via tagging, rules, and 3rd-party integrations—how they respond to email.</li><li><strong>Front's 72% DAU/MAU ratio is on par with elite, consumer-grade apps</strong>. WhatsApp was at 70% pre-Facebook acquisition. Combined with its 148 minutes of average active daily usage (compare to Slack at 90 minutes) Front effectively has the engagement of a high-grade consumer app.</li><li><strong>Front's 137% net dollar retention demonstrates they are landing and expanding with an extremely efficient bottom-up model.</strong> Compare to 143% for Slack at IPO and 140% for Zoom at IPO.</li><li><strong>Zendesk and Intercom pose a threat because they have much deeper access to customer data. </strong>Intercom embeds itself in their customers' websites, giving them direct insight into the behavior of their customers, while Zendesk serves as a centralized hub for all things sales, support, and/or knowledge management for hundreds of thousands of companies.</li><li><strong>However, Front's high engagement platform makes them attractive to third-party developers. </strong>The more activity Front can promote on its platform, and the larger the variety of integrations their customers are using, the more adoption they'll have inside organizations and the wider their moat—based on the cost of switching away to another email product—will become.</li><li><strong>Expanding across organization opens up the opportunity to "back into" $66B worth of adjacent vertical markets </strong>. While today Front is focused on facilitating third-party integrations to tools like Hubspot, Marketo, and Salesforce, building their own versions of these products would allow them to (at minimum, and per product) 2-3x their average revenue per user—today, Zendesk's Enterprise plan costs $199 a seat, while Front's most expensive plan is just $79 per seat.</li><li><strong>Building their own vertical solutions also puts Front on a converging course with Salesforce ($226B), Microsoft ($1.63T), and Google ($1.19T).</strong> Front's endgame is essentially to recreate the Google or Office 365 suite. But Microsoft was able to overtake Slack's active user count within just two years—a company that had similar ambitions. The threat Microsoft/Google pose and their ability to freely push copycat products to a user base of millions could make it extremely challenging for Front to move upmarket and reach enterprise scale.</li><li><strong>Front's product also makes them an attractive acquisition target. </strong>Rather than attempt to build their own team email product, Microsoft and/or Google could buy Front. That said, Salesforce is the company most likely to acquire Front—both because they don't have any email tool of their own yet and because there's no risk of cannibalization or customer confusion as there would be with a Microsoft/Google acquisition.</li><li><strong>Ultimately, Front’s consumer-grade engagement and ability to achieve org-wide adoption position them well to compete on their own in the cloud productivity space</strong>. Most deep workflow products serve specific functional units (Intercom, Zendesk, Salesforce) while products that serve whole teams (Outlook, Gmail) have only superficial access to customer data. Front, on the other hand, is a workflow product and an org-wide tool all in one: a combination that could make them a formidable competitor even to the 800 lb. gorillas of B2B SaaS.

              <p>This is my own journey on getting a CS degree and why I think you should or shouldn't major in Computer Science.</p><p>If you google right now, what are the best majors to study in college, it's a guarantee that Computer Science (CS) will be on almost every list. There are so many statistics about how much <a href="https://insights.dice.com/2019/06/12/computer-science-graduates-earnings/">CS graduates make</a>. At some big companies the likes of FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google), fresh CS graduates can easily command six figures salaries, including benefits and cool perks. The total compensation in these companies is hardly less than six figures ($100,000)!</p><p>Computer Science is considered one of the top majors as far as ROI (Return on Investment) is concerned. Just year one out of school and into the workforce a CS grad will be making higher compared to grads from other majors. Even when someone isn't lucky enough to land one of the positions in big tech companies (FAANG), still they can easily make 55k fresh from school. <em>It should also be noted that the writer of this article is based in the US, so the figures here might not be so representative of other regions in the world.</em></p><p>So looking at the job prospects and earning potential, you can see why there is such a flux of students wanting to do CS in college.</p><p>And here is the question, should you major in Computer Science? </p><p>This post is about my journey on deciding to major in CS and why I would advise someone to major or not to major in CS. </p><p>...</p><p>December 2014, I got the news that I will be going to a small college in the Midwest of the United States for my college education. I was 23 by the time and at that point in my life, I had made some big life mistakes already (like quitting high school to become a professional athlete). As you might have guessed that didn't end well. 2 years and a half taught me a lot about life, dreams, aspirations. and most importantly it taught me about family...that will be a blog post for some other time. But there I was reading the email that in about 8 months I would be in school again for my bachelor's. Before quitting high school, I used to say to myself... "if I go to college I would study Psychology and Philosophy"...because the two fields really dug my intellectual curiosity. But when people asked me what would I do with Psychology or Philosophy...I didn't know what to tell them...I only knew I wanted to learn more about the two fields. I wasn't interested in a professional career in any of the two fields...just wanted to study them. Did that ever happen to you?</p><p>So I didn't want to make the same mistakes I did during high school years...I intentionally made a choice of choosing a major field of study that will be lucrative and pretty much guarantee me success. There I was googling the best majors to study in college.</p><p>Here is a short snippet of that research:</p><figure><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Majors-That-Pay-Back.png" alt="Majors That Pay You Back" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Majors-That-Pay-Back.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Majors-That-Pay-Back.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Majors-That-Pay-Back.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Majors-That-Pay-Back.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Majors That Pay You Back</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Major-vs-Salary.png" alt="Major vs Salary Potential" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Major-vs-Salary.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Major-vs-Salary.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Major-vs-Salary.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Major-vs-Salary.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Major vs Salary Potential</figcaption></figure><p>Armored with that research plus a lot of other information I got from friends who were already studying CS and those who graduated with good jobs, I narrowed to Computer Science.</p><p>...</p><p>Fall 2015, my first year in college:</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Fall-2015-CS-Classes.png" width="2000" height="1200" alt="" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Fall-2015-CS-Classes.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Fall-2015-CS-Classes.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Fall-2015-CS-Classes.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Fall-2015-CS-Classes.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Spring-2016-CS-Classes.png" width="2000" height="1200" alt="" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Spring-2016-CS-Classes.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Spring-2016-CS-Classes.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Spring-2016-CS-Classes.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Spring-2016-CS-Classes.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div><figcaption>Fall 2015 (Left) &amp; Spring 2016(Right) CS Classes</figcaption></figure><p>Sophomore year, Fall 2016</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Fall-2016-CS-Classes.png" width="2000" height="1200" alt="" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Fall-2016-CS-Classes.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Fall-2016-CS-Classes.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Fall-2016-CS-Classes.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Fall-2016-CS-Classes.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Spring-2017-CS-Classes.png" width="2000" height="1200" alt="" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Spring-2017-CS-Classes.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Spring-2017-CS-Classes.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Spring-2017-CS-Classes.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/11/Spring-2017-CS-Classes.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div><figcaption>Fall 2016 (Left) &amp; Spring 2017 (Right) CS Classes</figcaption></figure><p>By the end of Spring semester 2017, I had completed<strong> 22 credits of the 46 credits</strong> required by the CS program at my school.</p><p>In the fall of 2017, I didn't return back to campus...I had an opportunity to study abroad in London where for the whole semester I didn't take any Computer Science class.

But for easy of following through I just listed in the order of the first time I took them. In addition, I took one elective from another school which was <strong>CS 428</strong> <strong>Network Programming, </strong>and also I took <strong>EN 300C,</strong> an <strong>Advanced Writing</strong> class from another department in my school which substituted for my <strong>Technical Writing</strong> class in my CS major. And one more <strong>Math class</strong> was required to satisfy the requirements for the CS major.</p><p>So in a nutshell, that was my major. 4.5 or 5 years later, <strong>46 CS credits</strong> bagged and I graduated with a bachelor's in Computer Science.</p><p>The reason I listed all those classes above is to give you kinda a full picture of what a CS degree is about. When you just hear the words 'Computer Science', you might not really know what it's about...So the subjects above will at least shade some light. However, if you really wanna dive deep, I would suggest not just to look at the subjects offered in the program BUT make sure you read the syllabus too if you're able to get one. Syllabi will list topic by topic and week by week of exactly what the specific CS subjects will cover, there will be no surprises!</p><p>...</p><p>Now comes the meat of my blog post...Should you major in Computer Science?</p><p>Taking the money component out - we already know that a CS major can result in higher earning potential overall. What other reasons are there for you to major in Computer Science? Are you even interested in the field itself?</p><p>Most people when they hear about the Tech fields or Silicon Valley or working at Google or Microsoft, they mostly think about Computers and they might think about Computer Science as a way to get there, though they might not really know much about the Computer Science field itself.</p><p>I don't blame them, I was in the same situation...Initially I thought Computer Science will be learning about how to create these beautiful websites that I see on the Internet. Or maybe by studying Computer Science I will be able to make the next Facebook, Instagram and so forth. That was what initially clouded my mind.</p><p>Some of you might be surprised to know that a career in tech especially the one involving Computer Science or Programming for that matter...might not necessarily constitute you making products from scratch. There will be a lot of trying to understand, fix and maintain past code base. It might not be as alluring as some of the TV shows might make you believe. The technologies you work with might not be the ones of your interest. For example, I have never liked C# as a programming language or .NET framework as a web dev platform but there I was at my first job...using Windows, Visual Studio and .NET framework. You can imagine how excited I was.</p><p>...</p><p>As someone who has traveled this journey though not for so long, I can't emphasize enough on the importance of knowing exactly what you're getting yourself into. After all, college is a big investment both in terms of money and time, so pick both your majors and careers carefully. One way of getting a good feel for what you're getting yourself into, either it's Computer Science or any other field is to make sure you get some internships while in college. Get an internship in something you're either majoring in or considering a career in. That will give you real-world experience of what your profession will look like once you graduate. It will give you time to think about the work culture, the work hours, the pressure, the work itself, etc. ...I had a friend in college who after doing an internship for about 4 months or so...he found out a career in Computer Science or programming wasn't for him. And he went ahead and changed his major from Computer Science to Economics, on the way he secured a minor in Computer Science.</p><figure><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/12/Monalidor---Do-you-like-your-job.png" alt="Do you like your job?" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Monalidor---Do-you-like-your-job.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Monalidor---Do-you-like-your-job.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Monalidor---Do-you-like-your-job.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/12/Monalidor---Do-you-like-your-job.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Do you like your job?</figcaption></figure><p>One of the things that will make you like your job is by first enjoying studying the field that you're in. Do you enjoy the field you're majoring in?</p><p>Look at the classes I listed above, do they interest you in any way? If they do then congrats! A CS program might be a good fit. But don't just end there like I said in the beginning...I would like you to go and check the syllabus for all those classes and see what you will study week in and week out. </p><p>Let me tell you something... as someone who was more interested in web development...I didn't enjoy most if not all of my CS classes. Had I used that time to learn more about web design and development...learning specific languages used for the job I would have benefited more and enjoyed my time in college. Here am talking about web development technologies like JavaScript, PHP and their frameworks together with WordPress, SASS, the JAM stack, etc.</p><p>So what am I trying to say here..? If the reason you decided to get into a CS program is because you love to design and develop websites...then you might be in the wrong place...a CS class in Computational modeling will be pretty much a bore to you. You would appreciate that time instead if you were learning first hand the tools and languages you will be working with in the real world.</p><p>Walk this process backward...ask yourself...who do you want to become...a web developer? a software engineer? a UI/UX engineer? a database administrator..? a network engineer? Then once you know whom you want to become...look for resources that will allow you to do that...these might involve a major in college, maybe a minor, books, online courses, tools used in the industry, etc.</p><p> If you pick a major, don't be blinded by a bracket name like a 'Computer Science'. Understand exactly what that entails...go and look at the syllabus of each course you will take in that major. Don't just assume a CS major will grant you those mobile or web development skills etc. The job market can be very specific...They might look for a Java developer, a PHP developer, a Python developer, an iOS developer etc. While knowledge of one language might help you easily pick up another one...it's a good thing if you can focus on what you're interested in early on. </p><p>...Being a mobile developer is …</p></div></div>

<p>In Segmentâ€™s early days, we hit countless problems as a founding team. And at the time, I thought those problems were unique to our own special snowflake of a founding journey. I chalked it up to us being new grads and first-time founders.</p><p>But as I've worked with more and more startups, I've realized just how wrong I was.</p><p>Over the past five years, I've made about 25 different seed-stage investments. In doing so, it's taught me a <em>LOT</em> about the common errors that startup founders make. Even across different industries and levels of experience, I see founders hitting the exact same set of problems we encountered in the early days of Segment!</p><p>This post shares a handful of the top lessons that benefit todayâ€™s early stage founders. Itâ€™s a list of the things I wish weâ€™d figured out earlier at Segment. [1]</p><p>This sounds incredibly boring... but the #1 mistake I see startups making is that they donâ€™t set goals. If you take one thing from this post, it's that you should set goals for where you want to be.</p><p>For the longest time at Segment, we didn't have goals. We moved ahead in various (often random) directions, and we would launch features consistently... but we never really set goals at all.</p><p>As we grew the company, we started to lose momentum. Teams were spending time on a bunch of stuff that frankly just didn't really matter to the overall business.</p><p>It wasn't until we hired our VP Eng, Tido, that we finally started setting focused and audacious product goals. Just by verbalizing where we wanted to go and then grading our results, our velocity improved by an order of magnitude.</p><p>I don't care if you call them OKRs, sprints, or something else entirely. Just set a deadline when you want to have something done and a metric you want to move or some other concrete result.</p><p>When early stage founders do attempt to set goals, I often see them agonize over what specific goals to choose. In practice, a "pretty good goal" is way better than "no goals at all". Perfect is the enemy of good.</p><p>If you don't yet have product-market fit, your goal should probably be getting your first 3-5 customers using the product. If you've hit the level where you now have dozens of users, your goal should be growing by an order of magnitude. It's better to get in the habit of setting and driving towards goals rather than being too worried about their exact semantics. Worst case, you just pick a better goal later.</p><p>A great set of goals answers the question: <em><strong>"what would have to be true in order for us to feel good about our progress at the end of the month?"</strong></em><em> [2]</em></p><p>If each teammate can independently answer "what are our goals for the month?" in the same way, you'll know you've succeeded. If youâ€™re looking for prior art, read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221">Measure What Matters</a>. </p><p>If you strictly focus on making things true by a certain date, you are bound to make at least some progress towards your end result. </p><p>At the end of the day, every billion-dollar startup is really just the sum of many small deltas.</p><p>Let's get one thing straight: your investors won't know everything. But investors won't know <em>anything</em> if you don't keep them updated on how things are going.</p><p>For the longest time, we were fearful of our Segment investors, to the point that we wouldn't bother sending them emails unless they asked about us. I can say now with confidence that this was 100% the wrong approach.</p><p>We worried that investors would think that we were screwing up (true) and failing (true as well!). And while that might be the case, a founder-friendly investor won't think that way. Investors, especially angels, invested because they believe in <em>you</em>. If I didn't think a team would go somewhere, I wouldn't put money in.</p><p>With each investor, <strong>include the goals you're working towards, as well as the asks for them</strong>. I think monthly is about the right cadence for this in the early days, moving to quarterly around Series A/B time when you start partnering more with a few board members.</p><p>Simply writing the updates should clarify your own thinking tremendously. If it takes you more than 1-2h to put together an update on the most important things happening at the company, it's probably a sign that you should be doing more thinking about the big picture.</p><p>When asking for help, the things that our investors have been able to help us with evolved quite a bit over time. But here's a good rule of thumb for what to ask for:</p><ul><li><p><u>Seed/Pre-seed</u>: user-testing, intros to beta users, hiring</p></li><li><p><u>Series A</u>: hiring, early customers, go-to-market</p></li><li><p><u>Series B/C+</u>: comparables at other companies, senior/exec hires, specific expertise around things like management, infrastructure, systems, etc.</p></li></ul><p>Not all investors will be able to help with everything. But at the very least, sending them information will help you be top of mind. I've lost track of how many times a moment of serendipity where I'm catching up with an old friend has led to a meaningful conversation for a company I've invested in.</p><p>As an extra bonus, the strongest startups send these updates to everyone on their team. It's amazing how much putting the goals in writing helps everyone stay on the same page about what's most important.</p><p>One other note here: take pictures. I now wish we had far more pictures of Segment at every stage of the company. They help turn investor updates into cherished memories.</p><p>Okay, this lesson is taken directly from the YC playbook. And YET, I see so many founders (including YC founders) fail to launch their product. </p><p>If no one notices your launch... just ignore it and then launch again. If you're doing things right, you'll never run out of stuff to launch! [3]</p><p>Why is launching so important? Let me share a personal story...</p><p>We spent about 1.5 years building different iterations of analytics tools. For every iteration, we had a waitlist that users could sign up to use. We personally reached out to the users who we thought were the best fits, and then tried to set up time to use the product. </p><p>The result? Nobody cared. We had no users. We never launched. </p><p>When we finally launched Segment in it's current incarnation, we threw out that approach entirely. We put up a self-service flow, and let anyone who wanted to sign up for it.</p><p>That's when something strange happened... we attracted an entirely new set of developers who just were crawling out of the woodwork and excited to use the new product we'd built. They were coming from companies far outside of SV that we'd never heard of.</p><p>It floored me.</p><p><strong>Lesson learned: the people you happen to be talking to now are probably not the people who have the biggest problem in your space. Do everything you can to reach the folks with the biggest problem, and then, reduce any barriers they might encounter.</strong></p><p>I expect a bunch of you reading this post to ignore this advice, just like we did in the early days. It takes a certain confidence to launch something you've built and put it out there for the world to see. Ultimately though, the rewards are worth it. You'll see users coming from communities you've never even heard of.</p><p>Let me tell you a tale of two startups.</p><p><strong>Startup A</strong> is constantly putting up interesting content on their blog. Their founders are sharing product launches, engineering posts, and creatively brainstorming about what it takes to solve problems in their market.</p><p><strong>Startup B</strong> is operating in stealth. You can't find much about them online, but one of the founders reached out with a nice personalized email mentioning their funding by a top-tier VC. </p><p>Suppose you're looking for a job... do you pick Startup A or Startup B? In my experience, A almost always wins. Momentum is a compounding force.</p><p><strong>Unless you are working in a space that heavily depends on IP, you should probably be publishing more content about what you are doing.</strong> This could be open source, it could be a weekly newsletter, it could be a changelog. [4]</p><p>Whatever it is, it's going to help you both hire <em>and</em> attract customers. So much of the internet is merely about consuming, that just by putting ideas out there, youâ€™ll have a leg up on the competition.</p><p>In the early days of Segment, our <a href="https://segment.com/blog/show-hn-to-series-d/">user acquisition was powered by open source projects and blog posts</a>. But I've seen founders have success with Twitter, Substacks, Podcasts and a variety of different channels.</p><p>If you're looking for inspiration, the <a href="https://railway.app/changelog">Railway</a> and <a href="https://linear.app/changelog">Linear</a> changelogs are epic examples. Companies like <a href="https://baremetrics.com/blog/i-sold-baremetrics">Baremetrics</a> and <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/shareholder-update-q2-2020-and-july/">Buffer</a> differentiated themselves by just being open and honest. <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/globe">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-feature-the-making-of-the-new-auto-layout/">Figma's blogs</a> not only share what they build, but how they built it.</p><p>There are three big inputs that all startups need to continue growing</p><ol><li><p>product capabilities</p></li><li><p>customers and users</p></li><li><p>hiring</p></li></ol><p>I've put them in roughly the order that most teams encounter them. </p><p>Startups begin with a small product that has a modicum of utility. It starts attracting a handful of customers organically. And as more and more customers start using the product, the founders realize that they need extra help to stay on top of all of those requests.</p><p>Remember though, the real goal here is #2. Itâ€™s not the size of your team, itâ€™s the value youâ€™re able to provide to the world. [5]</p><p>I see hiring a big team before you have product-market fit as a red flag. If the company doesn't yet have a set direction, it's going to be harder to pivot with 10 people than it is with 3.</p><p>But, I've worked with startups who have traction and runway... and just seem to be spinning their wheels under load from existing customers.</p><p>I get it. Hiring isn't the most fun, especially for an introvert. It's a lot of interviewing and feeling like there's a lot of rejection. Rejecting people sucks. Losing candidates sucks. For many of our roles at Segment, we've had to talk with 50-100 different people to make an eventual hire.</p><p><strong>If you have 24 months of runway, and a clear list of things youâ€™d do if you had more copies of yourself: you probably aren't spending time to hire the people you need.</strong></p><p>At Segment, my co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/ivolo">Ilya</a> fulfilled this role. It was back in 2014, we were 12 people at the time, had raised a $10m Series A, and had $1m in revenue.</p><p>Thing…</p></div></div>

<p>‘<a href="https://perl.org/">Perl</a> is dead’, is a meme that’s just plain wrong. <a href="https://www.perl.org/about.html">Perl isn’t dead</a>. It’s just dead to some programmers. Complicated regexes? Sigils? There’s more than one way to do it (<a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/glossary#TMTOWTDI">TMTOWTDI</a>)? Sometimes when programmers encounter Perl in the wild they react with fear. “WTF!?”, they cry! But fear needn’t be a Perl killer. If you take the time to see past Perl’s imperfections and <a href="https://www.perl.org/learn.html">walk the learning curve</a>, there are rich rewards: Perl is an imperfect but pragmatic and expressive language that for 30+ years has helped programmers get the job done.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall">Larry Wall</a> <a href="https://design.raku.org/">designed</a> <a href="https://raku.org/">Raku</a>, with the <a href="https://github.com/Raku/mu/blob/master/AUTHORS">help of the Perl community,</a> he fixed most of Perl’s imperfections and doubled down on Perl’s DNA. Perl values pragmatism, expressivity, and whipupitude and Raku does too! Why stop at sigils ($@%) when you can have twice the fun with <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#Twigils">twigils</a> ($!, %!, @! etc)?</p>



<p>For some programmers, however, the mere sight of a twigil can induce fear. Like Perl, Raku’s expressive power is a double-edged sword – potentially stopping other programmers in their tracks. A Raku programmer’s, “<a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/glossary#DWIM">DWIM</a>” (do what I mean) can be another programmer’s, “<a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/glossary#WAT">WAT</a>!?”</p>



<h2><a href="https://gist.github.com/nige123/2b7b384dfe2c6e732ecb1c62b3ce6c52#fear-free-code-that-flows"></a></h2>



<h2>Fear-free code that <em>flows</em></h2>



<p>We write programs for two audiences: humans and the computer. It’s the humans that should come first. If I can’t understand my own code in a week’s time, what hope do my colleagues have? Fortunately we can help ourselves, and each other, to have a smooth ride up the Raku learning curve.</p>

<p>Learning Raku is never boring but when did you last encounter a bump while learning Raku? That’s a chance for you to help yourself and others. You could leave an empathic comment in your code, contribute some documentation, write a blog post, give a talk, ask and answer a question on StackOverflow etc.</p>



<p>The joy of programming is <em><a href="https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2015/12/20/perl-6-christmas-have-an-appropriate-amount-of-fun/">finding flow</a> </em>for ourselves and each other while getting things done. No Raku-riffing-rockstars required.</p>

<h2>Surfing the learning curve</h2>



<p>Maybe you haven’t started learning Raku yet? Now is the perfect time to add Raku to your toolbox. Here are some of the learning resources I’ve found useful and I hope you do too.</p>



<p>Firstly, there is the pithy and concise <a href="https://raku.guide/">introduction to Raku</a> that includes instructions on how to install Raku. The Raku interpreter itself is very helpful. If your Raku program contains errors <a href="https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2016/12/19/fixing-flow/">Raku often suggests ways to fix them</a>.</p>



<p>For programmers coming from other language(s), <a href="http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Raku">RosettaCode</a> showcases coding solutions in different languages side-by-side. Prepare to be pleasantly surprised by the expressive power of Raku’s operators. Raku’s expressivity typically results in <a href="http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Last_Friday_of_each_month#Raku">less lines of code</a> (LLOC).</p>



<p>An idea for your first Raku program is to translate a progam you know well from a different language. Here are some helpful guides for translating from other languages to Raku: <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/5to6-nutshell">Perl</a>, <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/py-nutshell">Python</a>, <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/rb-nutshell">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/haskell-to-p6">Haskell</a> and <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/js-nutshell">Javascript</a>.</p>



<p>There’s a growing list of books on Raku and a <a href="https://perl6book.com/">flowchart for choosing one</a>. Here’s a selection:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.learningraku.com/">Learning Raku</a></li><li><a href="https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484261088">Raku Fundamentals</a></li><li><a href="https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484262573">Raku Recipes</a></li><li><a href="https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484232279">Parsing with Perl 6 Regexes and Grammars</a></li></ul>



<p>Searching for Raku-related problems will often point to the official documentation at <a href="https://docs.raku.org/">docs.raku.org</a> or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/raku">Raku answers on StackOverflow</a>.</p>



<p>When you want to learn more about a specific sub-topic or dive into the deeper design philosophy of Raku check out <a href="https://www.jnthn.net/slides.html">Jonathan Worthington’s clear presentations and explanations</a>.</p>



<p>Finally if you’re stuck on something, or just want to share in the –<a href="https://www.raku.org/fun/">Ofun</a> of learning Raku the <a href="https://www.raku.org/community/irc">#raku IRC channel on freenode</a> is friendly and welcoming.</p>



<p>Both Perl and Raku are useful tools in any programmer’s toolbox: no fear needed, just remember to help the code <em>flow</em>!</p>



<p>Long live Perl and Raku.</p>



<p>Happy Christmas!</p>

<p>Labels: Syntax</p>

<h3 id="indentation-defined-program-structure">Indentation-defined program structure</h3>

<p>I’ve planned for a long while to make Tuplex program structure indentation-defined like in e.g. Python.
Dispensing with curly braces and semicolons makes the code easier on the eye, and easier to type.
However this required a complete rewrite of the lexical scanner - the first compilation pass that scans the source text -
so I had been putting it off. Now it’s done!</p>

<h3 id="syntax-summary">Syntax summary</h3>

<p>The scanner will produce tokens INDENT and DEDENT upon increases and decreases in the indent level.
These have the same semantic meaning regarding scope structure as { and } did previously.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a decrease doesn’t match an earlier indent level an <em>inconsistent indentation</em> error is generated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A sub-scope is preceded by a header, which ends with a colon and a newline, and is demarcated using an increased indent.
(A missing INDENT after COLON NEWLINE is an error.)</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if i &gt; 0:
    do_this()
    do_that()
else:
    do_other_stuff()
do_in_any_case()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Semicolons are now optional. A newline is in most cases sufficient statement terminator.</p>

<p>One-liners are written like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if flag: v = 128; else: v = 256
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h3>

<p>Most programming languages do not use significant whitespace. Instead they use explicit printable tokens,
such as begin/end or { }. This makes it easier to implement parsers,
easier to programmatically generate source code (or embed source code within other files and programs),
and reduces risks of ambiguities in the grammar.</p>

<p>Explicit scope / suite enclosure also makes it easier to format statement lines and blocks as the
programmer sees fit. One can distribute a long statement across several lines,
or list several short statements as a concise one-liner. It separates source formatting from program logic.</p>

<p>If indentation is significant it means the tabs-or-spaces question is no longer entirely facetious.
In any given source text one or the other must be chosen. Although the parser can count both tab and space
characters just fine, it is debatable how many spaces shall correspond to a tab,
and above all they are not visually distinguishable.
Mixing tabs and spaces leads to ambiguity for the programmer, and is therefore disallowed.</p>

<h3 id="good-bye-curly-braces">Good-bye curly braces</h3>

<p>Python popularized the indentation-defined syntax and showed it can be combined with a largely elegant and
unambiguous grammar if the whole language syntax is designed with this approach in mind.</p>

<p>Curly braces are clear in meaning and stand out visually. But above all they are for the benefit of the parser,
not the programmer. Braces (or begin/end keywords) make it significantly easier to parse blocks and program structure.</p>

<p>A good programmer will indent the code consistently anyway. Braces only rarely convey meaning to a human reader
that isn’t already apparent from the indentation, which means they are typically redundant to the human.
If they are redundant they add noise that the programmer must look past, and if they also stand out visually
more attention must be spent on it.</p>

<p>In short, braces are for parsers and indentation is for programmers. Tuplex strives to impose a minimum of syntactic
and grammatical artefacts, and eliminate redundancy and boilerplate as much as possible. Thus the choice to 
reduce visual friction rather than make parser implementation easier.</p>

<h3 id="good-bye-semicolons">Good-bye semicolons</h3>

<p>Semicolons are optional, for much the same reasons as braces. The newline is in most cases a very natural statement
terminator. Semicolons may still be specified, for example to denote the empty (no-op) statement, or to separate
multiple statements on the same line.</p>

<p>Some statements get very long, for example long argument lists and complex long condition expressions are not that uncommon.
To facilitate this, a line that ends with a comma will have its linebreak ignored.
And in order to write a long expression across multiple lines it can be enclosed in parentheses.</p>

<p>Generally, any source text enclosed in (parentheses), [brackets], or {braces} will ignore line breaks.</p>

<h3 id="attempts-at-supporting-both-indentation-defined-and-brace-defined-syntax">Attempts at supporting both indentation-defined and brace-defined syntax</h3>

<p>With the existing grammar parser (built using Bison) there are still some limitations on how smart it can be
parsing the indentation- and newline-defined syntax. This causes some extended one-liner constructs to still
require braces, or an occasional extra semicolon at the end.</p>

<p>I explored a grammar design that would allow for both worlds, both brace-enclosed and
indentation-defined blocks, used and mixed as the programmer sees fit.
However this leads to a bunch of edge cases, and the biggest
problem is that resolving them requires ad-hoc rules for the grammar - there is
no intuitive “obviously correct way” when mixing them.</p>

<p>Consider for example, if allowing brace-enclosed and indentation-defined blocks within each other,
what a consistent treatment of these blocks would be:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if condition: {
        brace-enclosed body  ## note - INDENT
    }  ## note - DEDENT...
    {
        body part 2 with its own var-scope
    }

if condition:
    ## can an if-true-body now consist of several brace-enclosed blocks because they have similar indentation?
    {
        body part 1 with its own var-scope
    }
    {
        body part 2 with its own var-scope
    }
else:
    something_else()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the end, I enabled support for brace-enclosed scopes but disallowed mixing them with indentation-defined ones.
Within braces, INDENT, DEDENT, and NEWLINE are simply ignored (same as between parentheses and brackets).</p>

<h4 id="consistent-rules">Consistent rules</h4>

<p>A couple of specific rules needed to be defined to avoid ambiguities.</p>

<p>A. Within braces, all statements must be terminated with semicolon. (This makes the syntax similar to C et al.)</p>

<p>B. The colon must be on the same line as the preceding statement in order to prevents this sort of ambiguity:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if condition
    :            ## INDENT
    something()  ## no INDENT...

if condition
    : something()   ## INDENT
      other()       ## inconsistent INDENT
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>C. One-liner syntax can’t be mixed with indentation body syntax. This is an error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if condition: do_this()
    do_that()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>D. Brace-enclosure is needed to support single-line statement suites:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if cond1: do_a(); else: if cond2: { do_b(); do_c(); } else: do_d()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>E. For lambda expressions within statements, an extra semicolon can be necessary:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>localFunc := ( a : Int )-&gt;Int : return a * 2; ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Without a custom context-sensitive grammar / recursive descent parser the last semicolon above is hard to
avoid. In the current Tuplex grammar it is necessary.
The first semicolon terminates the lambda body’s statement; the second terminates the assignment statement.</p>

<h3 id="implementing-a-custom-scanner">Implementing a custom scanner</h3>

<p>The lexical scanner needs to understand both line structure, scope structure and token syntax. This
was difficult to implement with the Flex scanner Tuplex was originally built with.
So I built a custom scanner from scratch.</p>

<p>It was quite fun, and ended up being fairly efficient. I did manage to avoid writing an entire
regexp-engine while allowing for a decent amount of flexibility in evolving the lexemes and tokens
of Tuplex. Some benefits of the custom implementation include better support for edge cases in
string formatting syntax and in floating point literals.</p>

<p>One thing it doesn’t quite support at this stage is unicode. Tuplex shall support proper UTF-8 eventually,
but at that point the scanner will need some tweaking to not assume single-byte characters.</p>

<p>Since Bison expects a Lex/Flex interface I also wrote a facade for the scanner to translate between their
handling of line/positions and semantic values of literals. Also, since the previous Flex scanner
handled file reading, I had to write a file-to-memory reader to replace it.</p>

<p>Long-term I will probably replace the Bison-generated parser with a custom one as well, but I’m putting it
off as long as I can. Bison can handle almost everything Tuplex needs. There are some edge cases around
NEWLINE interpretation (e.g. the extra semicolon requirement above),
but I think Tuplex can live with that for the time being!</p>

				<p>Let’s imagine a two person startup where each co-founder is equal and there are no roles.</p>

<p>Now suddenly any number of corporate trappings of software development fall away:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is no ‘management’ - neither co-founder can fire the other or set their salary</li>
  <li>There are no dedicated roles like program managers, product managers, marketing, sales - anyone can be
assigned anything</li>
</ul>

<p>One might imagine that in such an environment all <a href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/project-management-surefire-way-kill-your-software-product">project management</a>
falls away and the startup is a developer utopia. <em>That’s not what happens.</em></p>

<p>Instead all of the pressure to deliver on intermediate milestones remains and <em>we</em> are the bad old boss who get’s blamed when things don’t get done.
So how do we influence productivity in a manager-free environment?</p>

<p>This is where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory">nudge theory</a>, influencing behaviour without coercion,
comes to the forefront - maybe it’s really the most important in more corporate settings also but there are
too many distractions to realize.</p>

<p>In startups, things that appear to be gospel truth frequently turn out to just be nudges.
This early paper on <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything">lean startup</a>
gives the example of Blue River Technology that very quickly learned that robotic lawn mowers for golf courses
were not a viable market and an automated way to kill weeds without chemicals was.</p>

<p>With the advantage of seven years hindsight two things are obvious:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.husqvarna.com/us/lawn-and-garden/professional/professional-robotic-mowers/automower-for-golf-courses">Robotic lawn mowers for golf courses</a>
are a market.</li>
  <li><a href="http://smartmachines.bluerivertechnology.com/">Blue River Technology</a> builds targeted automation to kill weeds
<strong>with chemicals</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the nudge theory point of view software developers are surrounded by nudges:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Language selection - ultimately one can do anything equally in Java and Python with enough effort. However a
language with a HotSpot compiler is going to nudge towards larger, more permanent servers.</li>
  <li>CI/CD tools are a nudge towards quicker deliver cycles.</li>
  <li>Remote technologies are a nudge towards potentially more productive work style options</li>
  <li>Available marketing channels are a nudge towards whatever can be sold via those channels</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="some-nudges-are-the-result-of-mostly-external-factors-but-some-involve-making-choices-about-our-environment">Some nudges are the result of mostly external factors but some involve making choices about our environment.</h3>

<p>Since tools are a nudge under our control everyone in software development should pay extra attention to them.</p>

    <p>One of the most hotly requested features for years has been to have multi-touch gestures in elementary OS, and with 6.0 I’m excited to say that we will deliver. Like the <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/dark-style-progress/">dark style preference</a>, delivering a great multi-touch experience is a little more complicated than it seems on the surface. There have been some 3rd party tools to detect touchpad gestures and then trigger actions after-the-fact, but it wasn’t until recently that we’ve had the technical ability to provide smooth, responsive animations that track 1:1 with your finger movement across a touchpad or touch screen.</p>

<h2 id="window-manager-gestures">Window Manager Gestures</h2>

<p>We’ve had the great pleasure of working with <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/JoseExposito">José Expósito</a>, the author of Touchégg, on our window manager gestures. In elementary OS 6, we use Touchégg Daemon behind the scenes to capture input events and communicate them to Gala, our window manager.</p>

  <figcaption>1:1 multi-touch gestures used for Multitasking View</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At the moment, we’re reviewing two proposals: one for the multitasking view and another for switching workspaces directly. Both of these use 1:1 responsive, finger-tracking gestures that can be peeked or canceled at any time. When special animations aren’t available in the window manager, such as when tiling, we fall back to animations built in to Touchégg.</p>

<p>We’re still discussing exactly what the default configuration should be, but work is already underway on System Settings so that you can choose whichever gestures feel most comfortable for you—or choose none at all.</p>

<p>If you’d like to support José’s work on multi-touch gestures for elementary OS 6—and other Linux-based operating systems—you can do so with as little as $2/mo on <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/JoseExposito">GitHub Sponsors</a>.</p>



<h2 id="app-gestures">App Gestures</h2>

<p>In order to make gestures work globally, previous solutions have opted to emulate keyboard shortcuts after a gesture was completed. This is effective, but animations—if they’re provided at all—don’t feel connected to users’ input. Instead, in elementary OS 6 we’re making use of Handy, a library originally developed for <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://puri.sm/">Purism</a> and their Open Source phone platform. This means that each app and desktop component must be updated to support gestures individually, which is ultimately a lot more work but a vastly superior experience.</p>

<h3 id="paging">Paging</h3>

  <figcaption>Paging screenshots in AppCenter</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In elementary OS 5, we used Handy to add gestures for switching pages to the applications menu and during onboarding. So far, in elementary OS 6 this has been extended to the Date &amp; Time indicator to switch months in the calendar view and to AppCenter to switch between screenshots. This makes use of the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://valadoc.org/libhandy-1/Hdy.Carousel.html">Handy Carousel</a> widget which also provides a smooth transition between page indicator dots when needed. Our plan is to provide gestures any time pages are used and we’re already tracking issues for Calendar and more.</p>

<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>

<p>Another place we’ve implemented gestures is while navigating between panes or views. This is using the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://valadoc.org/libhandy-1/Hdy.Deck.html">Handy Deck</a> widget which contains a concept of next and previous views and shows views in a neat stack. Swipe-to-go-back is now implemented in elementary OS 6 in Feedback, in the Installer and Initial Setup views for configuring locale variants, and in Systems Settings → Keyboard when adding new layouts. Gestures are also now available natively in WebkitGtk and therefore Epiphany also provides swipe navigation for both back and forward.</p>

  <figcaption>Navigating when adding keyboard layouts in System Settings → Keyboard</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Some more complex navigation situations are in progress such as when navigating between views in System Settings itself and in AppCenter. There are also open issues for navigating in Files and Photos, but development hasn’t yet started there. Working with Handy Deck in these situations has exposed some inefficiencies in the way navigation was implemented previously so not only are we implementing a new feature, but the underlying code is being made more robust and optimized.</p>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<p>We’re also looking into other uses for gestures as popularized in mobile operating systems, such as swipe to dismiss. In elementary OS 6, you can now dismiss notification bubbles from the desktop with a swipe, and remove them from the notifications indicator by swiping in either direction as well. We haven’t implemented swipe-to-dismiss in other types of lists yet, but we’re open to suggestions! You can follow along with our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/orgs/elementary/projects/61">progress and plans on GitHub</a>, as well as file feature requests.</p>

  <figcaption>Notification bubbles being swiped away in the new Notification Center</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A quick note about pinch-to-zoom and rotate, at the moment we don’t yet have a way to implement these more complex gestures. We may have to wait until we can provide GTK4 in a Flatpak or for elementary OS 7 before it becomes possible to provide gestures for transforms.</p>

<p>Lastly, I just wanted to say thank you to <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/alexm_gnome">Alexander Mikhaylenko</a> for being available for questions and feature requests as we implement Handy in our apps. He’s been an essential resource and very open to improving Handy for our use cases.</p>

<h2 id="get-early-access">Get Early Access</h2>

<p>If you’re excited by what you read here and want to get your hands on the developer preview of elementary OS 6, you can! GitHub sponsors at the $10/mo or above tier get access to our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://builds.elementary.io/">daily builds server</a> where you can test the latest and greatest experimental builds, including builds for Pinebook Pro. Subscribing helps us fund the development of elementary OS and brings us that much closer to delivering the final product.</p>

										Embedded Education									</a>

								<div>
									<p><span>“Learning no longer lives on an individual platform. Rather, learning happens everywhere. We’re entering a new age of ‘Embedded Education.’” — Tina He</span></p>
<p><span>Tina explains that “Embedded education is the practice of educating people through encounters that they already have with systems that exist primarily for non-educational purposes.” — Tina He</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re confused, don’t worry. Here are some examples that Tina references:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><i><span>How do you learn to invest in stocks?</span></i><span> You could take an online class. Or you could just download </span><a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/"><span>Robinhood</span></a><span> and dive in. Robinhood also launched “</span><a href="https://learn.robinhood.com/"><span>Robinhood Learn</span></a><span>” and has a great podcast “</span><a href="https://snacks.robinhood.com/"><span>Robinhood Snacks</span></a><span>” to educate users/potential investors on investing basics.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><span>How do you build a website</span></i><span>? You could learn how to code. Or you could sign up for </span><a href="https://webflow.com/discover/popular"><span>Webflow</span></a><span> and start building a website in minutes. Webflow doesn’t leave you in the dark, though. Similar to Robinhood they have </span><a href="https://university.webflow.com/"><span>Webflow University</span></a><span> that educates users on how to use their product in a fun and engaging way.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>*</span><i><span>Disclaimer—neither Robinhood nor Webflow are paid sponsors of this newsletter. But shoot…slide into my inbox if you work there and are interested </span></i><span>(</span><i><span>on the low</span></i><span>)*</span></p>
<p><span>Tina continues, “It’s not difficult to imagine that the more people acquire knowledge through using the platform, the more loyal and engaged they become, and eventually, the power users may even convert to ‘instructors’ and contribute back to the educational content library.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“If the purpose of education is to inspire courage to expand our collective understanding of the world, the vision of Embedded Education is that every time we see something that inspires us, the path to actualizing this new-found dream starts right where we find it.” — Tina He</span></p>
<p><span>Powerful final point: “…Some of the most insurmountable barriers [aren’t] access to resources, but access to understanding…language, in the form of jargon, flowery rhetoric, and corporate buzzwords, has created walls that accrue knowledge and power. Embedded Education is an attempt to break down these walls, redistribute information and knowledge through what we already do every day.” — Tina He</span></p>
								</div>
								<p><img src="https://gradually.co/wp-content/themes/gradually/img/two-cents.png">
								</p><!-- end half sqaure arrow -->
								<p><b><i>My two cents</i></b><span>: That last point in particular really brings Tina’s point home, in my opinion. Imagine a world that had 0 jargon. Or a world that gives the opportunity to learn the jargon immediately as you come across it. Lastly, I hope this final point doesn’t venture too far from Tina’s piece on embedded education, but I stand by the site </span><a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Monolith"><span>Urban Dictionary</span></a><span> SO confidently. It’s one of the best resources for getting a quick understanding of a word or phrase you don’t fully understand (aka jargon). Anyways, 2 cents? More like 50 cents. Apologies.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>Lately I have been analyzing some embedded devices such as routers, and want to share how to emulate, extract, and modify firmware.</p>
<p>We may want to do this for several reasons, such as enabling SSH/telnet to debug a service remotely, adding new features and looking for security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>If you want to dump the firmware from a physical device, you will want to use something such as the CH341A, but it won’t be covered here.</p>

<p>We will need some tools to analyze and emulate firmware, but thankfully the nice folks at Attify have made a specialized VM for analyzing embedded devices.</p>
<p>It comes with <a href="https://github.com/attify/firmware-analysis-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firmware Analysis Toolkit</a> which we will use to emulate the Netgear WNAP320 firmware, since it works well, and this way buying the hardware is not required to follow along.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.attify.com/attifyos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AttifyOS</a></p>

<p>Now that you have the VM downloaded, and running, open Terminator:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">iot@attifyos:~$ mkdir WNAP320 <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>cd</span> WNAP320
iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320$ wget http://www.downloads.netgear.com/files/GDC/WNAP320/WNAP320_V3.7.11.4.zip
</code></pre></div><p>Now we want to run the firmware, and for that we will use Firmware Analysis Toolkit. From their GitHub:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Firmware Analysis Toolkit (FAT henceforth) is based on Firmadyne with some changes. Firmadyne uses a PostgreSQL database to store information about the emulated images. However just for the core functionality i.e. emulating firmware, PostgreSQL is not really needed. Hence FAT doesn’t use it.</p>
</blockquote>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320/firmware$ <span>cd</span> ~/tools/firmware-analysis-toolkit/
iot@attifyos:~/tools/firmware-analysis-toolkit$ ./fat.py ~/WNAP320/WNAP320_V3.7.11.4.zip

</code></pre></div><p>Press ENTER and wait a bit, then visit 192.168.0.100 on your browser to make sure everything worked.</p>
<p><img src="https://sophielemos.com/posts/2020-11-21-105833_1918x902_scrot.png" alt=""></p>

<p>For this firmware, it seems the interesting stuff are inside a tar archive. It’s usually not that simple.</p>
<p>Let’s extract it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320$ unzip WNAP320_V3.7.11.4.zip 
Archive:  WNAP320_V3.7.11.4.zip
  inflating: wnap320_V3.7.11.4_firmware.tar  
  inflating: wnap320_V3.7.11.4_firmware_Release_Notes.html  
iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320$ mkdir firmware
iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320$ tar -xvf wnap320_V3.7.11.4_firmware.tar -C firmware
vmlinux.gz.uImage
rootfs.squashfs
enc_dec.config
root_fs.md5
kernel.md5
</code></pre></div><p>The files ending in .md5 are not important, they are hashes of the files to check their integrity:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320/firmware$ cat root_fs.md5 
55e71f05c4dfdcf1ea1a611f05ca371b  -
iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320/firmware$ md5sum rootfs.squashfs 
55e71f05c4dfdcf1ea1a611f05ca371b  rootfs.squashfs
</code></pre></div><p>The two files of interest here are: rootfs.squashfs and vmlinux.gz.uImage.</p>
<p>Whenever we encounter a file format that we’re unsure about, we can use binwalk.</p>
<p>binwalk will scan the unknown file or archive for file signatures, and is often able to extract it by itself:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320/firmware$ binwalk rootfs.squashfs 

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span>0</span>             0x0             Squashfs filesystem, big endian, lzma signature, version 3.1, size: <span>6329666</span> bytes, <span>1417</span> inodes, blocksize: <span>65536</span> bytes, created: 2018-10-25 08:11:35

</code></pre></div><p>Great, it is simply a squashfs filesystem. This is a compressed read-only filesystem often used in embedded systems. We will extract it later.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">iot@attifyos:~/WNAP320/firmware$ binwalk vmlinux.gz.uImage 

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span>0</span>             0x0             uImage header, header size: <span>64</span> bytes, header CRC: 0x8DD2855, created: 2018-10-25 08:11:29, image size: <span>983040</span> bytes, Data Address: 0x80020000, Entry Point: 0x8020E000, data CRC: 0x3663CBB2, OS: Linux, CPU: MIPS, image type: OS Kernel Image, compression type: gzip, image name: <span>"Linux Kernel"</span>

</code></pre></div><p>It seems this firmware uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_U-Boot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U-Boot</a> as a boot loader, which is very common in embedded devices. We also have the Linux kernel there. We also can see it’s meant to run on MIPS devices. Most embedded devices run either on ARM or MIPS architectures, as they are more energy efficient.</p>

<p>This is a very easy task, we can either use unsquashfs or binwalk to extract it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">root@attifyos:/home/iot/WNAP320/firmware# unsquashfs rootfs.squashfs 
Reading a different endian SQUASHFS filesystem on rootfs.squashfs

root@attifyos:/home/iot/WNAP320/firmware# binwalk -e rootfs.squashfs 

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span>0</span>             0x0             Squashfs filesystem, big endian, lzma signature, version 3.1, size: <span>6329666</span> bytes, <span>1417</span> inodes, blocksize: <span>65536</span> bytes, created: 2018-10-25 08:11:35

root@attifyos:/home/iot/WNAP320/firmware/squashfs-root# ls
bin  dev  etc  home  lib  linuxrc  proc  root  rw  sbin  tmp  usr  var

</code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we have access to the filesystem, we can do several things such as look for security vulnerabilities or modify the firmware.</p>
<p>This particular firmware has ssh enabled, and I don’t know what the default password for root is, so I will add another user:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">root@attifyos:/home/iot/WNAP320/firmware/squashfs-root/etc# openssl passwd -1 -salt salt super_secret_password
<span>$1$salt$GmyU7Z0gGyVy6JmSUPqHy1</span>
root@attifyos:/home/iot/WNAP320/firmware/squashfs-root/etc# chmod <span>777</span> passwd
root@attifyos:/home/iot/WNAP320/firmware/squashfs-root/etc# vim passwd
sophie:<span>$1$salt$GmyU7Z0gGyVy6JmSUPqHy1</span>:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh

                            <div>
                                <hr>
                                <h3>Finding your old Geocities Page</h3><p>
                                Unfortunately <b>not every page</b> was able to be archived and therefore there may be a very strong chance that your page has been lost to history :(</p><p>
                                
                                Having said that, the easiest way to find if your <b>Geocities Page</b> has been archived is to use the <b>two search boxes</b> to the top right of this page.
                                </p><ol>
                                    <li>
                                        The Google Search is a powerful search but <b>only returns pages that have been indexed by Google</b> and unfortunately, not every page has been indexed by Google.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The second text box uses our <b>internal search engine</b>, and while not as powerful as the Google Search it does <b>search every page</b> within the <a href="https://www.geocitiesarchive.org/">Geocities Archive</a> website.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>
                                Good luck :)
                                </p><hr>
                                <h3>About Geocities:</h3>
                                <p><b>Geocities</b> was acquired by Yahoo in January 1999 for $3.57 billion in Yahoo stock. Unfortunately the new terms and conditions introduced by Yahoo proved less than popular with the large majority of users as Yahoo stated that it now owned all content within <b>Geocities</b>.
                                After trying to provide a more premium service by offering vanity urls rumors began to surface during 2001 that <b>Geocities</b> would be closing.
                                </p>

And Front was, at first, popular mostly with support teams and other teams that deal with a high volume of customer inquiries. But over time, Front has grown from being a product for a specific kind of workflow to being a tool that people use across organizations.</p><p>The fact is that most companies are still stuck in time from twenty years ago when it comes to managing how they triage, assign, and respond to all those emails. That's a big pain point, because as it turns out, a lot of the critical work that companies do takes place over email. </p><p>What Front has realized is that owning the orchestration and collaboration around email puts them in a position to “back into” $66B worth of vertical markets—CRM, project management, knowledge management, conversational marketing, and others.</p><p>To show the size of that opportunity and demonstrate the progress that Front has made towards its goal in this report, we aggregated all the public data out there on Front, then extrapolating and interpolating to fill in the gaps using backchannels to confirm our numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>We learned that Front, like Slack, has consumer-grade engagement, elite compounding revenue from their land and expand strategy, and increasingly broad adoption inside teams.</p><p>By focusing on external vs. internal communication, however, Front may also have a TAM that is several times as large as Slack's.</p><h2 id="front-s-roadmap-to--2b--4b--20b">Front's roadmap to $2B/$4B/$20B</h2><ul><li><strong>Our financial model values Front at $1.3B, with a price per share around $11.</strong> At their Series C in January, they were valued at $920M, or about $7.70~ per share.</li><li><strong>Front is currently trading on the secondary market between $7.25 and $9.00 per share.</strong> 5-year IRR for each scenario in our model ranges from 3% to 22% in the bear case, 22% to 46% in the base case, and 84% to 118% in the bull case.</li><li><strong>Front is like Slack for email</strong>. It is a multiplayer tool that lets teams better communicate—via chatting with other team members within the context of a personal or shared inbox—and coordinate—via tagging, rules, and 3rd-party integrations—how they respond to email.</li><li><strong>Front's 72% DAU/MAU ratio is on par with elite, consumer-grade apps</strong>. WhatsApp was at 70% pre-Facebook acquisition. Combined with its 148 minutes of average active daily usage (compare to Slack at 90 minutes) Front effectively has the engagement of a high-grade consumer app.</li><li><strong>Front's 137% net dollar retention demonstrates they are landing and expanding with an extremely efficient bottom-up model.</strong> Compare to 143% for Slack at IPO and 140% for Zoom at IPO.</li><li><strong>Zendesk and Intercom pose a threat because they have much deeper access to customer data. </strong>Intercom embeds itself in their customers' websites, giving them direct insight into the behavior of their customers, while Zendesk serves as a centralized hub for all things sales, support, and/or knowledge management for hundreds of thousands of companies.</li><li><strong>However, Front's high engagement platform makes them attractive to third-party developers. </strong>The more activity Front can promote on its platform, and the larger the variety of integrations their customers are using, the more adoption they'll have inside organizations and the wider their moat—based on the cost of switching away to another email product—will become.</li><li><strong>Expanding across organization opens up the opportunity to "back into" $66B worth of adjacent vertical markets </strong>. While today Front is focused on facilitating third-party integrations to tools like Hubspot, Marketo, and Salesforce, building their own versions of these products would allow them to (at minimum, and per product) 2-3x their average revenue per user—today, Zendesk's Enterprise plan costs $199 a seat, while Front's most expensive plan is just $79 per seat.</li><li><strong>Building their own vertical solutions also puts Front on a converging course with Salesforce ($226B), Microsoft ($1.63T), and Google ($1.19T).</strong> Front's endgame is essentially to recreate the Google or Office 365 suite. But Microsoft was able to overtake Slack's active user count within just two years—a company that had similar ambitions. The threat Microsoft/Google pose and their ability to freely push copycat products to a user base of millions could make it extremely challenging for Front to move upmarket and reach enterprise scale.</li><li><strong>Front's product also makes them an attractive acquisition target. </strong>Rather than attempt to build their own team email product, Microsoft and/or Google could buy Front. That said, Salesforce is the company most likely to acquire Front—both because they don't have any email tool of their own yet and because there's no risk of cannibalization or customer confusion as there would be with a Microsoft/Google acquisition.</li><li><strong>Ultimately, Front’s consumer-grade engagement and ability to achieve org-wide adoption position them well to compete on their own in the cloud productivity space</strong>. Most deep workflow products serve specific functional units (Intercom, Zendesk, Salesforce) while products that serve whole teams (Outlook, Gmail) have only superficial access to customer data. Front, on the other hand, is a workflow product and an org-wide tool all in one: a combination that could make them a formidable competitor even to the 800 lb. gorillas of B2B SaaS.
</li></ul><h2 id="valuation--front-is-worth--1-3b">Valuation: Front is worth $1.3B</h2><p>Today, based on our model, we estimate Front is worth about $1.3B, with a fair share price of $9.5 to $11.</p><p>That’s up 40% from Front’s Series C, which valued the company at about $7.7 per share or $920M post-money. At the time, Front was at $26M ARR growing 5% CMGR6 for a 35x multiple.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we project Front is at about $38M ARR or $3.1M MRR, growing 3% CMGR6.&nbsp;</p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/sacra/731caebc-6ce9-4c26-8451-56f39d4618df_image13.png?auto=compress,format"><p><em>Applying the 35x multiple from Front’s last round to their current $38M revenue run rate gives us a valuation of $1.3B and an implicit per share price of $11. <a href="https://sacra.com/research/front-initiating-coverage-research-report/access" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Click here</a> to get the full data set.</em></p><p>Slack, for reference, was growing at 12% CMGR6 at the same ARR. According to our model, Front hasn’t grown at more than 10% CMGR6 since the summer of 2017, with growth hanging steady around 5% CMGR between April 2019 and early 2020, then declining slightly with the onset of COVID-19 in March.&nbsp;</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>For nearly 200 years, the United States continually admitted new states to the Union. But after Hawaii became the 50th state in 1959, expansion halted. Along with America’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Fall-American-Growth-Princeton/dp/0691175802/">broader stagnation</a>, population growth has slowed.</p><p>In the 20th century, America defeated fascism and communism. Her hegemony, while marred by myriad missteps, ushered in an era of unprecedented peace, prosperity, and liberty. But if America is to defend her hegemony, she must grow again. Scale is essential for innovation and economic growth and underpins America’s military strength. 330 million Americans simply won’t be able to compete against 1.4 billion Chinese. Globalization and free trade aren’t a substitute for scale either, for they deprive the nation of its autonomy in world affairs.</p><p>The solution is for Canada and Mexico to join the Union—i.e., for Canada and Mexico, or their constituent states, to be voluntarily admitted into the United States. America and her institutions are uniquely suited to accommodating this larger and more heterogenous Union and to forging a common political community. The example of German reunification demonstrates that economic convergence is possible too, as I will explain. In addition to reenergizing America, propelling economic growth, and making Americans better off, this would have extraordinary benefits for Canadians and Mexicans too. In particular, tens of millions of Mexicans could be lifted out of poverty.</p><p>In his excellent recent book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/One-Billion-Americans-Thinking-Bigger/dp/0593190211/"><em>One Billion Americans</em></a>, Matthew Yglesias argues for massive population growth as well, though he proposes achieving this through subsidizing fertility and increasing immigration. In practice, these proposals may not rise to the challenge. If the choice America faces is between decadent decline or renewed growth, an expanded Union may be our best bet for the latter.</p><p>To be clear, I realize that this is a somewhat crazy idea. So don’t take take this essay as a wholesale endorsement of the proposal. But I do think it is an idea worth exploring—if only for the sake of expanding our conception of the possible. I invite you to explore it with me.</p><h2 id="bigger-is-better">Bigger is Better</h2><p>A central concept in growth economics is that of “increasing returns to scale”: essentially, bigger is better. A larger population and a larger market benefits all.</p><p>A larger population enables more innovation. More people means there are more creative minds with new ideas and inventions. In turn, more people means more customers, so a new invention is more profitable, incentivizing firms to invest in research and development. This drives economic growth.</p><p>A larger market also enables more specialization. One city can focus on developing software, another on manufacturing cars, a third on financial services. This specialization makes firms and workers more productive, again driving economic growth.</p><p>Think of it this way. A small country would struggle to support an ambitious space program; the cost would be too high. But a large country <em>can</em> support an ambitious space program; distributed over a large population, the cost per person is manageable. The same principle applies to things like medical research, technological development, and military investment.</p><p>This logic of increasing returns to scale underpinned much of the economic case for globalization. The free exchange of goods and people would make us all better off, the high priests of economics told us. And they were right! We can all enjoy Silicon Valley’s software and Germany’s cars. A German-American pharmaceutical collaboration, headed by Turkish and Greek immigrants, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/business/biontech-covid-vaccine.html">recently created</a> the first vaccine shown to be effective against Covid-19. The gains to scale through globalization have been extraordinary.</p><p>So, then, the solution to the quest for scale is globalization? We don’t need a larger America after all—free trade agreements like NAFTA are enough?</p><p>The problem with globalization is that it deprives the political community of its autonomy—particularly in that most essential realm of war and peace. The nation can no longer determine its own destiny, but rather becomes dependent and vulnerable and subject to whim of others.</p><p>For instance, as the American establishment has become clearer-eyed about the rise of authoritarian China, they have suddenly realized that maybe, <em>just maybe</em>, outsourcing much of America’s manufacturing there was a bad idea. If the Chinese acted on their expansionist ambitions, would America be able to push back—or would we be cowed by the cutoff of the supply of new iPhones and a tanking stock market?</p><p>Even trade with allies who purport to share our values is questionable in this regard. If push came to shove and a general war broke out, could America <em>really</em> rely on the German industrial base to start mass producing weapons? Honestly—probably not. America prevailed in WWII because she could mobilize her epic industrial might to produce an “arsenal of democracy.” If America were once again to find herself in an existential struggle, I fear she would not be able to pull off that same feat again.</p><p>This deprival of the political community’s autonomy is what so many Europeans despise about the European Union. While the cosmopolitan elite may identify as “European,” first and foremost most Germans still think of themselves as German, most French people still as French, and most Britons still as British. Their political community is their nation, not the EU. So when an EU technocrat—someone they didn’t elect, much less identify with—tells them how to live their lives, they rebel.</p><p>This has led to an instinct of retrenchment and a push to reverse globalization, most famously Trump’s trade wars. What this gets right is how interdependence has undermined America’s independence. If America can’t defend her core interests and values because she is entirely dependent on others, her hegemony becomes a farce.</p><p>What this gets wrong is that America, alone, with its puny 330 million people, will not be able to compete. America’s hegemony rests on her economic might, sustained by her roaring engine of innovation. America’s economy in turn supports her dominant military. But without the benefits of scale, America will not be able to sustain her economic primacy. 1.4 billion Chinese will be able to outpace and out-innovate 330 million Americans if they try go it alone.</p><p>Without scale, America will decline; her hegemony will wither. But increased scale through globalization robs America of her freedom to act; her hegemony become toothless. How, then, to square the circle?</p><p>There is one possibility. Rather than enmeshing America with foreign countries, make America itself bigger! Enlargen the political community! A bigger nation can enjoy the innovation and specialization made possible by scale. But it also retains its autonomy. Though larger, the nation is still a coherent political community that can determine its own fate.</p><p>Arguably, this is what America has always done. It expanded from one coast to another and rapidly grew its population. That’s how America became the hegemon in the first place, replacing the smaller British. But America now stagnates: her territory fixed, her population growing ever-more slowly, ultimately unable to keep pace with the world’s rising powers. If America wants to preserve her hegemony, she must grow again.</p><h2 id="growing-america">Growing America</h2><p>A bigger America is exactly what Matthew Yglesias argues for in his excellent recent book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/One-Billion-Americans-Thinking-Bigger/dp/0593190211/"><em>One Billion Americans</em></a>. Yglesias envisions this growth occurring through increased fertility and immigration—with the goal of, as the title indicates, a population of 1 billion. Directionally, this is sound. But, realistically, Yglesias’s proposals won’t get us anywhere close to the massive population growth he imagines.</p><p>America’s birth rate is already substantially below the replacement level. We could count ourselves lucky if Yglesias’s suite of proposed pro-natalist policies even got us back to replacement. Extensive family benefits like the ones he proposes have been tried in Europe, and they <a href="https://www.agglomerations.tech/taking-one-billion-americans-seriously/">haven’t yielded</a> a massive baby boom.</p><p>Similarly, America could definitely accommodate—and benefit from—significantly increased immigration. But I think Yglesias underestimates the political challenge of bringing in the requisite number—hundreds of millions—of immigrants. Sure, theoretically, we could raze our cities and build a sea of skyscrapers in their stead to accommodate the newcomers. But the forces of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY">NIMBYism</a> in America are already so strong as to block nearly all new construction in our powerhouse metropolises. Sure, theoretically, we could remake the cultural and ethnic mix of our communities with new arrivals of all colors and creeds. But the forces of nativism in America are already so strong as to barely tolerate the current level of multiculturalism. In his wonderful optimism about America, Yglesias forgets the deep sclerosis that has beset the country. Practically speaking, immigration could yield a few tens of millions more Americans, not <em>One Billion Americans</em>. That is very much worth doing, but it is not enough.</p><p>We need a different proposal. We need a proposal that can rise to the magnitude of the challenge, achieving massive growth rapidly, while also being practically possible. We need Canada and Mexico to join the Union.</p><p>This is not some “globalist” project; this is not an attempt to erect some supranational “North American Union” like the EU. The goal would not be to have Canadians, Mexicans, and Americans somehow coexist in a supercharged version of NAFTA. Rather, it would be to make Canadians and Mexicans Americans—to make them part of the political community. It would be an affirmation of the nation; a reinvigoration of the age-old project of the United States; a fulfillment of the American destiny.</p><p>Accepting Canada and Mexico into the Union would inject the nation with new lifeblood: young men and women eager to work hard, entrepreneurial minds with …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<hr>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se15/html/index.html">Java Language Specification</a> specifies in minute
detail the grammar and semantics of the Java Programming Language. It also includes platform features
like the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se15/html/jls-12.html#jls-12.2">loading of classes and interfaces</a>,
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se15/html/jls-7.html#jls-7.7.4">service provisioning</a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se15/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.7">annotations</a>
that can provide runtime and compile-time information for meta-programming.</p>

<p>With all these features, I think it’s fair to consider <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-glance.html">Java Standard Edition</a>,
or Java SE, as a framework in its own right.</p>

<p>It is not to be confused with <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javaee-8-sdk-downloads.html">Java EE</a>, or
Java Enterprise Edition <a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> (recently rebranded as <a href="https://jakarta.ee/">Jakarta EE</a>), which adds <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/">loads and loads of APIs</a>
against which Java programmers can create huge enterprisey things on top of
<a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/pages/3.0/jakarta-server-pages-spec-3.0.html">JSPs</a> and <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/5.0/jakarta-servlet-spec-5.0.html">Servlets</a>,
for example.</p>

<p>Java EE was all the rage in the early 2000’s, but these days
you’re more likely to find Java software based on things like <a href="https://spring.io/">Spring</a> and its more
streamlined version <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">Spring Boot</a>, or even trendier things like
<a href="https://micronaut.io/">Micronaut</a> and <a href="https://quarkus.io/">RedHat’s Quarkus</a> (I know it must be very cool because its slogan is
<em>SUPERSONIC SUBATOMIC JAVA</em>), both of which promise to make Java more Kubernetes/Cloud/Microservice friendly <a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>What you’re very unlikely to see is Vanilla Java being used in the real world.</p>

<p>By Vanilla Java, I mean just Java SE, without any frameworks, making use of only small libraries, where it makes sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The term “Vanilla Java”, as I am using here, was inspired by our JS friends who coined <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">Vanilla JS</a>
for the “framework” included in every browser since the 1990’s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As most people who have had to create complex applications on top of multiple frameworks can attest, frameworks do not
bring only upsides. They bring a lot of downsides too.</p>

<p>If you’re unlucky enough to need something fundamental that is not supported by the framework (or even that is just not
easily found in the documentation), you may need to employ horrible hacks to get things done. Over the years, the number of
hacks might grow so much that you might realize you’ve implemented a second framework on top of your framework to work
around its (perceived or real) limitations.</p>

<p>This is the number one cause of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ball_of_mud">big balls of mud</a> appearing in long-lived,
not-so-loved code bases, in my opinion.</p>

<p>What if I told you that you can write applications in Java using just the tools the SE platform provides?
What if in doing so, you did not significantly increase the amount of boilerplate code you have to write by a
significant margin when compared with the size of the application you have to write?</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://renato.athaydes.com/images/java-se-framework/electric-light-bulb_1f4a1.png" alt="Light bulb moment">
    </figure>
</div>
<p>Suddenly, there’s nothing to be worked around. Everything you need, you can go and write or change yourself using the
language you know, with the help of whatever library you need (and Java has a library for everything). Searching for
information on your “platform” is a breeze.</p>

<p>In this blog post, I want to show you features of Java SE that you may not have realized are available to you as well,
not only to framework authors.</p>

<p>I will show you how you can create an application that <strong>hot-reloads when you re-compile it</strong> (because yes, that has
been a feature of Java all along, not of any particular framework, though they would like you to think so).
Then, I’ll show how you can create your own annotations and use them to magically generate code to do what you want,
so you can still avoid having to write tedious code that sinks productivity.
Finally, I will show how you can write and run tests without any framework, using JUnit as a library and CLI.</p>

<p>We will do all this while using <strong>no build system</strong> at all, just a few helper libraries, because after all, we are not
savages: we do want to benefit from the free work of others to get our shit done quickly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Each section of this blog post will have a link to the relevant branch of the <a href="https://github.com/renatoathaydes/raw-jse">raw-jse</a>
repository I’ve created to accompany it. The links look like the one shown below, with a checkered flag representing
each <em>checkpoint</em> we’ve accomplished.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Let’s get started.</p>



<h2>Hot Reloading a Java SE App</h2>

<p>🔄</p>

<p>The first thing we need to stay productive while writing a new application is hot-reloading.</p>

<p>If you haven’t had hot-reloading before, you might think this is a minor improvement over whatever your current situation
is and as such it’s not a must-have. You would be mistaken.</p>

<p>It’s huge to be able to re-compile your application and immediately see the results in front
of you. It’s better than a REPL because it’s your actual code running, not just some snippet you’re playing around with!</p>

<p>To get hot reloading in Java is not hard. You just need to split up your application into a kind of loader application
which never changes, and a dynamic part which you can hot swap at will.</p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge, there’s no way to hot swap ALL of your code unless you attach a debugger to it
(which allows only very limited hot swapping) or use black magic related to <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-management-extensions">JMX</a>
(which I think is what JRebel used to do).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wrote a blog post years ago about <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/athaydes.com/renato-athaydes/posts/4freewaystohot-swapcodeonthejvm">4 different ways to hot-reload code</a>
on the JVM. The method I will show here is fundamentally different, though, as it will work without a debugger,
without enabling JMX and is almost certain to work with any Java version, even with Java 16-EA, because we’re only
using the SE platform, nothing else.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To demonstrate hot reloading, I’ll create a simple application class that implements <code>Runnable</code>. Every time we
re-compile the application, it will re-run the application class (this re-compilation itself can also be automated
easily via a small bash script or your IDE).</p>

<p>In a real app, this would be something like a HTTP request handler, or <code>Controller</code> as people like to call it,
but to start with, this example should do.</p>

<p>Here’s our super complex first implementation:</p>

</pre>
<p>If we just ran this from <code>main</code>, we couldn’t re-compile it and expect the JVM to let us re-define the class later.
Even if we could do that, we would eventually run into trouble when we kept state somewhere (think of a cache for
example) and then re-defined the classes that state depended upon.</p>

<p>We need to, as I said in the introduction, split up our application classes that we want to be able to reload from
the application engine, which will be static.</p>

<p>Let’s call our application engine <code>framework</code> because that’s what it is replacing for us. You may think that writing
our own framework is no better than using an existing framework, but the point is that this is not a generic framework,
it’s a framework we’re writing to do exactly what our particular application needs to do. As you’ll see, it’s going to
stay simple because it has a hugely simpler job than a generic framework that needs to be able to do everything, a
patently impossible goal that we’re staying well clear of.</p>

<p>We should keep the <em>framework</em> classes and the <em>app</em> classes in separate compilation units (or modules).</p>

<p>The framework will need two things, a <code>Main</code> class to bootstrap the app and hot reload it, and a <code>WatchDir</code> class
to monitor the app compilation directory for changes, so it can automatically reload the classes when they change.</p>

<p>The final result should look something like this in your file system:</p>
<pre>.
├── app
│   ├── app.iml
│   └── src
│       └── Starter.java
├── framework
│ ├── framework.iml
│ └── src
│     ├── Main.java
│     └── WatchDir.java
└── raw-jse.iml
</pre>
<p>The <code>.iml</code> files are created by IntelliJ because even though I dislike heavy frameworks, I like IDEs very much.</p>

<p>If you’re curious how to create the above structure in IntelliJ, just create a simple Java project without build tools or
libraries, then do <code>File &gt; New &gt; Module...</code> for <code>app</code> and <code>framework</code>, then create the Java classes.</p>

<p>The <code>WatchDir</code> class uses Java’s <code>FileWatcher</code> as shown in the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/examples/WatchDir.java">Oracle Tutorial</a>,
which I basically copied, then simplified to call a lambda a couple of seconds after changes were detected, but only if no
more changes occurred in the previous couple of seconds (so the compiler can keep writing class files and we’ll only load
them once the compiler stops doing work).</p>

<p>This is what <code>Main.java</code>’s <code>main</code> function looks like:</p>
<pre><span>final</span> <span>class</span> <span>Main</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>final</span> AtomicReference<span>&lt;</span>AppRuntime<span>&gt;</span> appRef <span>=</span> <span>new</span> AtomicReference<span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

        <span>if</span> <span>(</span> args<span>.</span><span>length</span> <span>!</span><span>=</span> 2 <span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            System<span>.</span><span>err</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span> <span>"Usage: java Main &lt;classpath-dir&gt; &lt;runnable-class&gt;"</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span>
            System<span>.</span><span>exit</span><span>(</span> 1 <span>)</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>
        var classPathDir <span>=</span> <span>new</span> File<span>(</span> args<span>[</span> 0 <span>]</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span>
        var appClassName <span>=</span> args<span>[</span> 1 <span>]</span><span>;</span>
        <span>new</span> Main<span>(</span> classPathDir<span>,</span> appClassName <span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>// more code...
</span><span></span><span>}</span>
</pre>
<p>As you can see, we take the classpath of the app and its <code>Runnable</code> class as arguments, create a <code>WathDir</code> instance
to watch over the classpath, and let it call <code>this::swapApp</code> when it is re-compiled.</p>

<p>We keep an <code>AtomicReference&lt;AppRuntime&gt;</code> so we always know which app is currently loaded.</p>

<p><code>AppRuntime</code> is a simple data class:</p>
<pre><span>final</span> <span>class</span> <span>AppRuntime</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>final</span> Class<span>&lt;</span><span>?</span><span>&gt;</span> appClass<span>;</span>
    <span>final</span> URLClassLoader loader<span>;</span>

    AppRuntime<span>(</span> Class<span>&lt;</span><span>?</span><span>&gt;</span> appClass<span>,</span> URLClassLoader loader <span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>appClass</span> <span>=</span> appClass<span>;</span>
        <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>loader</span> <span>=</span> loader<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre>
<p>The <code>swapApp</code> method is very simple:</p>
<pre><span>final</span> <span>class</span> <span>Main</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// omitted code...
</span><span></span>    
    <span>private</span> <span>void</span> <span>swapApp</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<p>I have to admit, my research blog posts are getting longer and longer. From one
side I find it genuinely encouraging, because if one gets so much information
just by scratching the topic, imagine what’s hidden beneath the surface! One
university professor once said “what could be interesting in databases?”, and
it turns out freaking a lot! On the other side it certainly poses problems for
potential readers. To overcome them I would suggest an interesting approach:
print this blog post out, or open it on your tablet/e-reader, where you can
make notes with a pencil or markers. Now while reading it try to spot ideas
particularly exciting for you and mark them. Along the way there would be
definitely some obscure parts or questions, write them on the sides as well.
You can experiment with the diagrams, changing or extending them, or just
drawing funny faces. But do not read everything at once, have no fear of
putting it aside for a while, and read in chunks that are convenient for you.
Some parts could be skipped as the text is build out of relatively independent
topics. The table of contents can help and guide you. Having said that we’re
ready to embark on the journey.</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Whenever we speak about indexes, especially in PostgreSQL context, there is a
lot to talk about: B-tree, Hash, GiST, SP-GiST, GIN, BRIN, RUM. But what if I
tell you that even the first item in this list alone hiding astonishing number
of interesting details and years of research? In this blog post I’ll try to
prove this statement, and we will be concerned mostly with B-tree as a data
structure.</p>
<p><img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/btree-joke.png" width="80%"></p>

<p>Let’s start systematically and take a look at the definition first:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and
allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic
time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is your first association with the concept of B-tree? Mine is “old and
well researched, or in other words boring”. And indeed apparently it was first
introduced in <a href="https://infolab.usc.edu/csci585/Spring2010/den_ar/indexing.pdf">1970</a>! Not only that, already in 1979 they
were <a href="http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~ad/M149/ubiquitous_btree.pdf">ubiquitous</a>. Does it mean there is nothing exciting left any
more? Once upon a time I came across a remarkable read called
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1561/1900000028">Modern B-Tree techniques</a> which inspired me to dig
deeper into the topic and read bunch of shiny new whitepapers. Afterwards
totally by chance I’ve stumbled upon a book “Database Internals: A Deep Dive
into How Distributed Data Systems Work”, which contains great sections on
B-tree design. Both works were the triggers to write this blog post. What was I
saying about nothing exciting left? At the end I couldn’t be more wrong.</p>
<p>It turns out that there are multitude of interesting ideas and techniques
around B-Trees. They’re all coming from the desire to satisfy different (often
incompatible) needs, as well as adapt to emerging hardware. To demonstrate how
many of those exist, lets play a game. Below you can find a table of names I’ve
found in various science papers, together with a couple of silly names I’ve
come up myself. Can you find out the fake ones?</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>B-tree</td>
<td>B<sup>+</sup>-tree</td>
<td>B<sub>link</sub>-tree</td>
<td>DPTree</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>wB<sup>+</sup>-tree</td>
<td>NV Tree</td>
<td>FPTree</td>
<td>FASTFAIR</td>

<tr>
<td>HiKV</td>

<td>VAST Tree</td>
<td>FAST</td>
<td>HV Tree</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UB Tree</td>
<td>LHAM</td>
<td>MDAM</td>
<td>Hybrid B<sup>+</sup> Tree</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Any ideas? Well, I have a confession to make – all of them are real, I just
don’t have enough imagination to come up with such names. Having this in mind
hopefully you understand that if we want to make a survey, the first step would
be to establish some classification. Not only this will help us to structure
the material, but also will explain why on earth anyone would need to invent so
many variations of what we though was so simple!</p>
<h2 id="2-rum-conjecture">2. RUM conjecture</h2>
<p>To classify different index access methods we need to think about the following
ambitious question – is there anything common between almost any index access
method? The authors of <a href="https://stratos.seas.harvard.edu/files/stratos/files/rum.pdf">RUM conjecture</a> provide an interesting
insight about this topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fundamental challenges that every researcher, systems architect, or
designer faces when designing a new access method are how to minimize, i)
read times, ii) update cost , and iii) memory (or storage) overhead.</p>
<p>In this paper, we conjecture that when optimizing the read-update-memory
overheads, optimizing in any two areas negatively impacts the third</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This essentially states that if an index access method could be specified as a
point inside “Read”, “Update” (on the Fig. 1 it’s called “Write” for
convenience of drawing), “Memory” space we can observe an interesting
invariant. Every time we modify one index access method to have less overhead
for reading or memory footprint (i.e. shift the corresponding point closer to
“Read”/”Memory” corners), we inevitably loose on the updating workload (i.e.
getting further away from “Write” corner).</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>In fact as a non-scientist I would even speculate that there should be another
dimension called “Complexity”, but the idea is still clear. I will try to show
this invariant at work via examples in this blog post, but it already gives us
some ground under the feet and opportunity to visually represent different
versions of B-tree by moving point on the triangle back and forth. But first
let’s recall the basics.</p>
<h2 id="3-b-tree-basics">3. B-tree basics</h2>
<p>So what is B-tree? Well, it’s a tree data structure: a root node, some number
of branch nodes (marked grey) and a bunch of leaf nodes (marked green):</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/btree.png" width="100%">
<br>
<figcaption>
Fig 2. B-tree nodes arrangement
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Every node of this tree is usually a page of some certain size and contains
keys (shaded slices of a node) and pointers to other nodes (empty slices with
arrows). Keys on page are kept in sorted order to facilitate fast search within
a page.</p>
<p>The original B-tree design assumed to have user data in all nodes,
branch and leaf. But nowadays the standard approach is a variation called
B<sup>+</sup>-tree, where user data is present only in leaf nodes and branch
nodes contains separator keys (pivot tuples in PostgreSQL terminology). In this
way separation between branch and leave nodes become more strict, allowing
better flexibility for choosing format of former and making deletion operations
can affect only latter. In fact the original B-tree design is barely worth
mentioning these days and I’m doing this just to be precise. Since
B<sup>+</sup>-tree is sort of default design, we’ll use B-tree and
B<sup>+</sup>-tree interchangeably in this text from now on. An interesting
thing to mention here is that the only requirements for separator keys is to
guide search algorithm to a correct leaf node. As long as they fulfil this
condition they can contain anything, no other requirements exist.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, only child pointers are truly necessary in this design, but
quite often databases also maintain additional neighbour pointers, e.g. what you
can see on the Fig. 2 between the leaf nodes. It could be helpful for some
operations like index scan, but need to be taken into account for node
split/merge operations. PostgreSQL uses <a href="https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy460/pdf/p650-lehman.pdf">Lehman-Yao</a> version,
called B<sub>link</sub>-tree, with links to both left and right sibling nodes
(the left link one is actually not presented in the original
B<sub>link</sub>-tree design, and it makes backward scan somewhat interesting),
and there are even implementations like WiredTiger with
<a href="https://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger/blob/f08bc4b18612ef95a39b12166abcccf207f91596/src/include/btmem.h#L550">parent pointers</a>.</p>
<p>Having all this in place one can perform a search query by following the path
marked red on the Fig. 2, first hitting the root, finding a proper separator
key, following a downlink and landing on a correct page where we deploy binary
search to find the resulting key.</p>
<p>Until now, we were talking only about static parts of B-tree design, but of
course there is more to it. For example there is one dynamic aspect of much
importance (quite often it even scares developers like a nightmare), namely
page splits. What do we need to do when there is a new value to insert, but the
target page does not have enough space like on the following diagram?</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/page-split-1.png" width="60%">
<br>
<figcaption>
Fig 3. B-tree page split (a)
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What happens here is we’re trying to insert the new value (shaded box) into the
page with not enough space for it. To maintain the three balanced we need to
allocate another leaf page, distribute keys between old and new leaf, promote a
new separator key into the parent page and update all required links
(left/right siblings if present):</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/page-split-2.png" width="60%">
<br>
<figcaption>
Fig 4. B-tree page split (b)
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Curiously enough the new separator key could be chosen freely, it could be any
value as long as it separates both pages. We can see what does it change in the
optimization section.</p>
<p>Locking is obviously an important part of a page split. No one wants to end up
with concurrency issues when pages get updated while in the middle of a split,
so a page to be split is write-locked as well as e.g. right sibling to update
left-link if present.</p>
<p>As you can see, page splits are introducing performance overhead. We need to
bring in a new page, move elements around and everything should be consistent
and correctly locked. And already at this pretty much basic point we already
can see some interesting trade-offs. For example B*-tree modification tries to
rebalance data between neighbouring nodes to postpone page split as long as
possible. In terms of trade-offs it looks like a balance between complexity and
insert overhead.</p>
<p>I didn’t tell you everything about B<sub>link</sub>-tree and it’s going to be our next
topic example in this section. Not only Lehman-Yao version adds a link to the
neighbour, it also introduces a “high key” to each page, which is an upper bound
on the keys that are allowed on page. While obviously introducing a bit memory
overhead those two changes make it possible to detect a concurrent page split
by checking the page high key, which allows the tree to be searched …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><h2 id="i-needwantlove-examples">I Need/Want/Love Examples</h2><p>I know that when I try out a new product, if it’s hard to see what it does quickly I usually move on. This is a shame because I’m sure there are products out there that I could have benefited from but it was just too difficult to get something up and running.</p><p>Release is the easiest way to create environments from any code change, Pull Request or the click of a button. We deploy your environments in a Kubernetes cluster that’s completely managed for you. <em>But in order to see how Release can change how you build software, you have to get your application running in Release.</em> Most of the time this is pretty straightforward, but there is definitely a setup curve to get over before you can see our product in full form. </p><p>The best technical products I’ve used always have a TON of great examples.  Stripe is definitely the king of this idea… we were just recently integrating their checkout feature into Release and <a href="https://github.com/stripe-samples" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">their examples repo</a> is a model for how this can be done. It made our integration with Stripe so much easier than digging through docs to figure this all out.</p><p>I think examples are highly under-done, especially with highly technical products. I’m pretty sure I know why (especially after this project): it’s hard to spend the time and energy building out examples when you have features to build. But at Release, examples are a first class citizen and we believe will make getting up and running with Release easier.</p><h2 id="awesome-compose-is-awesome">awesome-compose is awesome</h2><p>As we started building and testing Release, we came across this fantastic repository, <a href="https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose</a>, that has community created applications known to work with docker-compose. </p><p>Since Release can easily use a docker-compose file to create blueprints for environments, this was a perfect way for us to test out Release and make sure all the various ways docker-compose files are used are supported in the platform. Enter awesome-release</p><h2 id="awesome-release-is-awesome">awesome-release is awesome++</h2><p>We put together an <em>awesome</em> organization in Github with a ton of repositories that just work in Release that are derived from awesome-compose.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/awesome-release" title="Awesome examples running in Release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/awesome-release</a> is chock full of amazing projects that just work. The great part about all of these projects is that they show the range of how making simple applications to complex applications can be run and environments created within Release.</p><p>So if you’re getting started and need a project that will just work out of the box, I highly recommend forking or copying any of these repos and use it to create an app in Release. Every repository in <em>awesome-release</em> just works.</p><p>We’ve made modifications to some of the awesome-compose repos that needed slight tweaks. In each README we’ve described what we did to make the project work. Most of these things are minor adjustments that enable the project to run in a hosted Kubernetes environment vs being run locally via docker-compose.</p><p><a href="https://releaseapp.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Click here to signup for Release and give it a shot!</a></p><p>Please let us know if there is an example you’d like to see and we’ll put it together for you. Just send us an email at <a href="mailto:support@releaseapp.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">support@releaseapp.io</a> and we’ll add it to the list.</p><p><strong>Have fun and happy Releasing!</strong></p></div></article></div>]]>

      <h4>Popular usage of the term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ adds to misunderstanding of AI as it exists today.</h4>
      
      </div><div>
      <h2 id="the-options">The Options</h2>
<p>Definitions of the term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ tend to fit one of the following categories:</p>

<ol>
  <li>‘field of research’ definitions, e.g.: “a branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers” (<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/artificial%20intelligence">Merriam-Webster</a>) , “the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence” (Oxford)</li>
  <li>‘machine intelligence’ definitions, e.g.: “the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior “(<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/artificial%20intelligence">Merriam-Webster</a>) , “intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals.” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">Wikipedia</a>) , “the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.” (<a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/artificial-intelligence">Encyclopedia Brittanica</a>)</li>
  <li>‘intelligent entity’ definitions, e.g.: “a computer, robot, or other programmed mechanical device having [the] humanlike capacity [to perform operations and tasks analogous to learning and decision making in humans, as speech recognition or question answering]”. (<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/artificial-intelligence">Dictionary.com</a>)</li>
</ol>

<p>While all of these options are similar in that they deal with ‘intelligent behavior’ in computers, they are also quite different. The first refers to a research discipline, while the second and third describe what that research discipline seeks to create. The ways in which the term ‘AI’ can be used depend on which of these definitions you consider valid. For instance, news articles often have titles to the effect of “Google’s new AI learned X” or “A new AI can do Y,” such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/06/artificial-intelligence-develops-its-own-non-human-language/530436/">“An Artificial Intelligence Developed Its Own Non-Human Language”</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90455358/ai-can-now-design-cities-should-we-let-it">“AI can now design cities, but should we let it?”</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danadovey/2020/02/11/first-time-ever-artificial-intelligence-develops-drug-candidate/">“For The First Time Ever, A Drug Developed By AI Will Be Tested In Human Trials”</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/google-s-ai-built-it-s-own-ai-that-outperforms-any-made-by-humans">“Google AI creates its own ‘child’ AI that’s more advanced than systems built by humans”</a></li>
</ul>

<p>But, such usage (“An AI Developed”, “AI can now”, etc.) is only valid with that third ‘intelligent entity’ definition. If the first ‘field of research’ definition is chosen instead, these titles would have to be rewritten as “Google’s new AI algorithm learned X” or “A new AI system can do Y.” In this piece, I’ll make the case that this definition and form of usage is superior to the alternatives, and should be adopted in most cases.</p>

<h2 id="why-should-we-care">Why Should We Care</h2>
<p>It may seem pedantic to say one of these definitions is better than any of the others, and tempting to just say all of them are fine. However, I argue that the ‘field of research’ definition of AI is better than the alternatives, primarily because of the <a href="https://www.aimyths.org/ai-has-agency">common misunderstanding</a> that AI programs today are independent agents with some amount of ‘free will’. In fact, what AI researchers and engineers build today are just computer programs, which are capable of emulating some aspects of human intelligence but are otherwise (for the most part) no more independent than the apps on our smartphones. Nevertheless, AI researchers recently ranked the idea that the AI algorithms they create have some human-like independence as the most common and problematic myth about AI; it was “number one by a long shot” <a href="https://www.skynettoday.com/podcast/top-ai-myths">according to a survey</a> asking which myths about AI are most common.</p>

<p>I believe part of why this myth is so predominant has to do with thinking of AI in terms of the ‘intelligent entity’ definition type and using the term accordingly by saying statements such as “A new AI can do Y”. Expanding that statement results in “A new Artificial Intelligence can do Y,” and the notion that the sentence refers to ‘An Intelligence’ inevitably implies agency similar to those of animals and humans. AI researcher Julian Togelius addresses this notion well in his blog post <a href="http://togelius.blogspot.com/2017/07/some-advice-for-journalists-writing.html">“Some advice for journalists writing about artificial intelligence”</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Keep in mind</strong>: There is no such thing as “an artificial intelligence”. AI is a collection of methods and ideas for building software that can do some of the things that humans can do with their brains. Researchers and developers develop new AI methods (and use existing AI methods) to build software (and sometimes also hardware) that can do something impressive, such as playing a game or drawing pictures of cats.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AI researcher Zachary Lipton made this point more bluntly:</p>

<figure>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear world (CC <a href="https://twitter.com/businessinsider?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@businessinsider</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/Hamilbug?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Hamilbug</a>):
stop saying "an AI". AI's an aspirational term, not a
thing you build. What Amazon actually built is a "machine learning
system", or even more plainly "predictive model". Using
"an AI" grabs clicks but misleads <a href="https://t.co/0kdTLBsrHJ">https://t.co/0kdTLBsrHJ</a></p>—

11, 2018</a></blockquote> 
</figure>

<p>As someone who has tried to use my knowledge as an AI researcher to address popular misconceptions about AI, I have observed and continue to observe the usage of “An AI” often, and think it has the negative side effect of feeding misunderstanding of what AI is today. While it may be tempting to once again say this is being pedantic and that it’s fine to have a more ‘pop culture’ view of AI, with AI becoming increasingly embedded in our society it is more important than ever that all of us understand it. Such understanding is crucial so that we can collectively correctly focus on the most pressing issues with respect to AI (such as bias, automation, its use for surveillance, its safety) and not the issues that the agency myth implies (its potential to go rogue a la Skynet in the near term).</p>

<p>Therefore, given the existence of the ‘agency’ myth with respect to AI and the importance of correctly understanding what AI is actually like today, I would argue the first ‘field of research’ definition of the term ‘AI’ is better than the alternatives. As I’ll show next, this is (unsurprisingly) typically how AI researchers themselves use the term.</p>

<h2 id="how-researchers-define-ai">How Researchers Define AI</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)">John McCarthy</a>, one of the founders of the field of AI, defined AI as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Professor <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/manning/">Christopher Manning</a><a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2020-09/AI-Definitions-HAI.pdf"> </a> <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2020-09/AI-Definitions-HAI.pdf">recently cited</a> this as the definition of ‘Artificial Intelligence’ in his summary of definitions of terms related to AI. Similarly, in “Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach”, Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig defined AI as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“the designing and building of intelligent agents that receive percepts from the environment and take actions that affect that environment.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To cite just one more example, in “The Quest for Artificial Intelligence: A History of Ideas and Achievements” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nils_John_Nilsson">Nils J. Nilsson</a> defines AI as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“[the] activity devoted to making machines intelligent”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are of course many other definitions, but they tend to share the quality of considering AI a research or engineering discipline rather than a term that can be used to refer to singular algorithms or systems.</p>

<p>I conducted an informal survey to check whether AI researchers generally agree with this form of definition, with the following results:</p>

<figure>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>AI Researchers: how do you define the term 'Artificial Intelligence'? </p><p>A: the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs</p><p>B: intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence of animals</p><p>C: Other</p></div>— Skynet Today (@skynet_today) <a href="https://twitter.com/skynet_today/status/1326239401912004611?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2020</a></blockquote>  
</figure>

<p>While hardly a careful study of what most AI researchers feel, the result of this poll agrees with my personal observations as an AI researcher that most in the field seem to prefer the John McCarthy definition of AI to the alternatives. I point this out because I think it further lends credence to the idea that the ‘field of research’ definition that does not allow for “An AI” as a phrase is superior to the alternatives. Granted, no one has any right to impose a particular way of defining terms on others, but I still think using the term ‘AI’ the same way the people actually working on AI in the real world (as opposed to science fiction, where ‘An AI’ is appropriate) makes a lot of sense.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>
<p>AI researchers tend to define ‘Artificial Intelligence’ to mean something along the lines of “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs” – the ‘field of research’ definition. This is in contrast to definitions often used in popular media, which use ‘AI’ to refer to particular programs or systems with sentences – the ‘intelligent entity’ definition. The latter usage of AI reinforces an already common myth that present day AI has some amount of human-like agency, when in fact this is not really the case. Therefore, I believe that the ‘intelligent entity’ type definition should be avoided in favor of the ‘field of research’ definition, and the term should be used accordingly.</p>

Is meat bad for you?</h2><p>For most of us conscious eaters, these questions seem inconsequential and their answers obvious, easily confirmed by the growing trend of plant-based meat alternatives and the abundance of scientific data indicting meat for our health woes.</p><p>Athletes and celebrities like Kyrie Irving, Serena Williams, Joaquin Phoenix, and James Cameron proudly sport vegan lifestyles. Films like <em>What The Health</em>, <em>The Game Changers</em>, and many others praise the benefits of a plant-based diet. In most circles, the supremacy of plant foods is simply unquestioned. It has become an incontrovertible truth, one we've all known since as far back as we can remember, echoes of mom saying "finish your veggies" reverberating in our skulls.</p><p>But what if we were wrong?</p><p>What if you took the two banal questions at the top and flipped them on their heads:&nbsp;</p><p>Are vegetables <em>BAD</em> for you? Is meat <em>GOOD</em> for you?</p><p>These might be more interesting questions to explore. Asked in this way, instead of confirmation bias tending toward the already widely accepted convention of “plants good, meat bad,” we might try to prove or disprove the opposite.</p><p>I am by no means the first one to ask these questions. Apparently, I'm not even in a small minority here. When I first started looking into the carnivore diet, I was astonished at just how many people were experimenting with it and how much information was being shared around it. Even more, I was surprised that... a lot of it made sense.</p><p>The main thing that resonated with me was the biological perspective on the organisms we eat for nourishment. From middle school science class, I remember learning that every living organism has two basic imperatives: </p><ol start="" role="list"><li>survive, and</li><li>reproduce.</li></ol><p>If you apply this lens to the things we eat, you start to understand how some people might believe that vegetables can be bad for you, that plant foods, not meat, are to blame for the laundry list of our health problems, mostly by way of<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493173/"> chronic inflammation</a>.</p><p><em>(Indeed, "chronic inflammatory diseases are the most significant cause of death in the world.” They include stroke, chronic respiratory diseases, heart disorders, cancer, obesity, and diabetes. After the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 49 percent of people hospitalized for COVID-19 had preexisting hypertension, 48 percent were obese, and 28 percent had diabetes. All three are symptoms of chronic inflammation.)</em></p><p>For biological imperative number one, survival, an animal's tactics include speed, camouflage, claws, fangs, and occasionally poison. A plant, on the other hand, can't run away or physically fight back. Its first line of defense against being eaten is often a thick barrier, like bark or a cuticle, and possibly hard shells, thorns, or spines. If the exterior defense is breached, a plant's primary survival mechanism generally comes down to chemical warfare: toxins and enzymes that deter, harm, or even kill animals that ingest them.</p><p>Plant metabolites like alkaloids can produce noxious fumes or repugnant tastes, or cause excessive stimulation (caffeine) or lethargy (opioids). Other compounds like glycol cyanide, found in cassava roots, release cyanide upon ingestion. Still more deadly compounds produced by plants, like cardiac and steroidal glycosides, can cause nausea, vomiting, hallucinations, convulsions, or death if ingested.</p><p>Importantly, some plants approach survival as a long game, at the species level, with a focus on the second biological imperative: reproduction. They take the view that the best defense (survival) is a good offense (reproduction). A fruit- or nut-bearing plant, for example, offers tasty, high-energy snacks that attract mobile eaters, luring them into taking a bite. Being eaten is the goal here, at least in part, so that the eater may disperse the plant's seeds and produce life anew for its progeny. Seeds tend to be heavily protected, often coated in antinutrients like phytic acid or containing cyanogenic glycosides like amygdalin, to ensure they stay intact through the gastrointestinal tract or even get discarded.</p><p>Ultimately, it seems that a plant's survival is dependent on wholly or partially avoiding digestion. So what does that mean for us humans, who persistently prey on potentially pernicious plants? Perhaps, not much.</p><p>If you believe the hype, some high-performing athletes like<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrik_Baboumian"> Patrik Baboumian</a> stay at the top of their game by eating almost entirely plants. Yet again, other elite athletes like<a href="https://twitter.com/zbitter"> Zach Bitter</a> consume copious amounts of animal foods, while<a href="https://twitter.com/2min_keto"> some</a> go as far as eating<a href="https://twitter.com/SBakerMD"> only meat</a>.</p><p>So what's going on here?</p><p>To further examine the validity of this unconventional idea, and possibly the flaws in our conventional thinking, I committed to trying the carnivore diet for a month: 30 days, zero vegetables. Actually, no plants whatsoever. Fully aware of my bias favoring meat, I took on a carnivorous way of eating to collect some empirical data and examine three important questions:</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>Could meat be good for you?</li><li>Could vegetables be bad for you? More specifically to me: Could plant foods be to blame for my chronic pain?</li><li>Could meat be good for the environment?</li></ol><p>I planned the start of this experiment to coincide with <a href="https://www.edlinbetsthefarm.com/blog/why-i-left-san-francisco-tech-to-live-and-work-on-a-farm-part-1">my move from city life to a farm</a> called<a href="https://www.whiteoakpastures.com/?rfsn=4343802.7600d7"> White Oak Pastures</a>, where they practice regenerative agriculture and I could eat, very literally, farm to table. Because as much as the growing interest in carnivory is health motivated, I also believe the ecological impact of meat- and plant-eating is largely misunderstood and could use some good old N=1 analysis.</p><p>But first...</p><h2>What exactly is the carnivore diet?</h2><p>Put simply, the carnivore diet consists of only animal products, but there's a spectrum. My food intake consisted of meat, dairy, eggs, salt, and water. That's it. I didn’t eat anything that contained anything else. No sauces, dressings, etc. No teas or coffee. The ONLY exception I made was bacon. White Oak Pastures bacon is sugar-free but cured with kosher salt, red pepper flakes, black pepper, celery powder, and cherry powder.</p><p>If you want to be (even more) extreme about it, the true zealots eat only beef, salt, and water. Some call this the lion diet. Fun fact: the lion is my spirit animal, so I was tempted to go all out, but I thought having the option of cheese every so often would increase the likelihood that I'd actually make it a full month. And bacon. Hard to live without bacon.</p><p>Basically, the carnivore diet is the complete opposite of a plant-based diet. It means no plants whatsoever,<a href="https://faq.impossiblefoods.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019100553-What-is-soy-leghemoglobin-or-heme-"> Impossible Foods' imitation heme</a> be damned.</p><h2>Common concerns about an all-meat diet</h2><p>Given our pervasively conventional understanding of diet and health, the first few thoughts that jump to mind when considering a carnivore diet are: What about fiber, won't you get constipated? What about vitamin C, won't you get scurvy? And WHAT ABOUT FIBER? HOW WILL YOU POOP?!</p><p><strong>On vitamin C.</strong> As it turns out, there is vitamin C in beef liver and in eggs. Not as much as in an orange, but in the context of a carnivore diet, these sources provide sufficient levels of vitamin C to avoid scurvy and any real deficiency. According to the<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/worldcarnivoretribe/"> masses</a> in<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/carnivoreaureliusnation/?multi_permalinks=3512931485396546"> several</a> different<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/PrincipiaCarnivora/"> carnivore</a>-focused<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/donteatthatblog/"> communities</a>, as long as you're eating nose to tail, or at the very least supplementing beef liver, vitamin C deficiency is not a concern.</p><p><strong>On fiber.</strong> Poop, regularity, colon cancer, constipation! You might think a meat-heavy diet would require lots of fiber, but you would be wrong. The supposed importance of fiber in a healthy diet seems to be widely accepted, but it may very well be a<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1663443/"> consequence of modernization</a>. Effectively, fiber has been recommended for its supposed metabolic benefit, particularly as it relates to mitigating the adverse metabolic effects of a high-carbohydrate diet. The "benefit" is that fiber slows the digestion of food and hinders nutrient accessibility and absorption. But the context in which these effects are a benefit is that of an unhealthy diet. On a healthy diet, or more specifically here, on a diet low in carbohydrates, the effects of fiber are unnecessary.</p><p>After a moderate level of research, I felt safe to conclude that the alleged benefits of dietary fiber address problems spawned by the modern American diet in the first place, if they address any problems at all. It's more likely that dietary fiber is a soon to be anachronistic idea, its health claims part of an attempt to sell more of a surplus crop, itself the result of an outdated farm subsidy. In fact, the World Journal of Gastroenterology published a study showing that<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3435786/pdf/WJG-18-4593.pdf"> reducing fiber actually reduces digestive issues</a>.</p><p>And if you're concerned about colon cancer, at least two double-blind, randomized clinical trials have shown that neither a<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10770980/"> dietary supplement of wheat-bran fiber</a> nor a<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12223437/"> high-fiber diet</a> reduced the risk of colorectal adenoma, the precursor to colorectal cancer.</p><p>A fiberless diet seems counterintuitive until you think about babies: for the first 6 months of our lives, humans eat absolutely no fiber yet have no problem filling up diapers.</p><p><strong>On hydration.</strong> While it didn't immediately jump to mind as a concern, a little research revealed that a meat-only diet can mean increased electrolyte loss leading to dehydration. Because a carnivore diet is essentially an extreme form of a Keto diet, my body would be in ketosis and flushing out more salt. This leads to reduced water retention and can result in dehydration. So I planned on drinking two liters of water per day and being generous with salting my meat. I bought a 1-liter Nalgene to easily track my water intake, aiming for two full bottles everyday.</p><p>All that aside…&nbsp;</p><h2>Could meat be good for you?</h2><p>According …</p></div></div></div>

And it’s a shame.  <strong>Marginal gains are about making small incremental improvements to a process (or product, ability or habit etc) which, when added together, make a significant improvement</strong>. But legal innovation often ignores it.  Why? We’ll find out.  We’ll also provide an easy intro to a few mental models that can identify and deliver these gains within your legal organisation, whether law firm or in-house!</p><h2>What are marginal gains?</h2><p>Consistently improving something by 1% isn’t particularly notable, let alone noticeable.  But in the long run it can be <strong>meaningful</strong>.</p><ul><li>If you improve something by 1% each day for one year, you’ll end up <strong>37 times better</strong> by the end of the year.</li></ul><ul><li>Conversely, if you only get 1% worse each day for one year, you’ll <strong>decline down to almost zero </strong>by the end of the year.</li></ul><p>If the principle sounds familiar, you may have heard of similar ideas, e.g. <strong>continuous improvement</strong> or <strong>Kaizen</strong>.  Both continuous improvement and Kaizen have as their goals the ongoing improvement of products or services and the elimination of waste through data-informed iterative analytical improvements.  Many of these improvements will be small, but when added together represent a large improvement.</p><h2>Why care?</h2><h4>It wins gold meals</h4><p>The <strong>marginal gains</strong> theory was popularised by <a href="https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/membership?gclid=Cj0KCQiAqdP9BRDVARIsAGSZ8AnEnL5TB7QykSE4kP3duW3orq_qoJcRdjhaogZQtNDxSuQIwcqV99waAlDMEALw_wcB">British Cycling</a>‘s 2008 and 2012 Olympic cycling team.  Prior to 2008, British Cycling was widely regarded as a “laughing stock”.  In an effort to fix things British Cycling hired performance director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Brailsford">David Brailsford</a>.</p><p>Brailsford believed that 1% improvements across all aspects of cycling aggregated into a significant performance gain.</p><p>Under his guidance British Cycling implemented all sorts of tiny improvements:</p><blockquote><p>Using antibacterial hand gel to cut down on infections, rubbing alcohol on bicycle tires for better grip, redesigning bike seats for greater comfort, extensive wind tunnel testing of bikes and racing suits etc.</p></blockquote><p>Within 5 years after Brailsford took over, British Cycling won 57% of all road and track cycling gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, and at the 2012 London Olympics set 9 Olympic records and 7 world records.</p><p>During the ten-year span 2007 – 2017, British cyclists won 178 world championships and 66 Olympic or Paralympic gold medals and captured 5 Tour de France victories.</p><p>Quite a turnaround.</p><h4><strong>Big returns are the accumulation of small wins</strong></h4><p>Over time, the difference between allowing something to worsen by 1% each day vs. improve by 1% each day becomes extremely significant.  Consider the below:</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="869" height="348" src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_Table.png" alt="Marginal Gains Table" srcset="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_Table.png 869w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_Table-300x120.png 300w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_Table-768x308.png 768w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_Table-585x234.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" data-src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_Table.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure></div><p>If you start the year with £100 of value and manage to improve that value by 1% each day for 365 days you <strong>37x </strong>that value by year end.  Over time, assuming the same 1% per day incremental improvement, that value balloons to a very large number.</p><p>Conversely, letting that value degrade by 1% each day quickly reduces that value to a very small number.  £100 becomes £2.55 after one year of daily 1% declines! Thereafter it reduces further and further toward, but never reaching zero, although in real (as opposed to mathematical) terms, it hits zero just after 1 year.</p><p>As this graph demonstrates:</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_2.png" alt="Marginal Gains Graph 1% better or 1% worse each day for 365 days" width="962" height="584" srcset="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_2.png 962w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_2-300x182.png 300w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_2-768x466.png 768w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_2-585x355.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 962px) 100vw, 962px" data-src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marginal_Gains_2.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure></div><p>Which curve would you prefer to be on? The blue or the red?</p><h4><strong>Small is easier to start</strong></h4><p>If you break down a larger goal, problem or process into smaller steps, it is easier for an individual or organisation to measure, critique, brainstorm solutions for and implement winning improvements over time.  As attractive as double digit improvements sound, they are often hard to contextualise and action, let alone start.</p><h4><strong>Competitive edge</strong> hides in the margins</h4><p>As with the British Cycling example, focusing on 1% marginal gains can create a competitive edge.  This is all the more so given how easily and often marginal gains are overlooked.</p><p>Car manufacturing, where similar principles of continuous improvement and Kaizen originate, paint a similar picture.</p><p><a href="https://www.toyota.co.uk/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAqdP9BRDVARIsAGSZ8Ak7bStcKvAgldLvrbdCHVp9lJGnkGmXSqqk2pAByRvNt3YoNhW3ROIaAnAOEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Toyota</a>, pioneer of the <strong><a href="https://www.toyota-europe.com/world-of-toyota/this-is-toyota/the-toyota-way">Toyota Way</a></strong> and derivative principles (e.g. Six Sigma, Lean), used this attention to detail and marginal gains philosophy. In doing so Toyota quickly leapfrogged the US car manufacturing industry in the latter half of the last century, building a lasting reputation as a reliable manufacturer of superior and well priced cars vs. its overpriced and unreliable US counterparts.</p><h2>Why marginal gains are wrongly overlooked</h2><h4>1% returns excite no one</h4><p>Instinctively a 1% improvement to a product or process sounds too small a target. You’re probably aiming higher: 25% or 50%+ gains.</p><blockquote><p>Put it this way: given the choice, would you prefer someone promising a 25% gain today or a 1% improvement each day?</p></blockquote><p>You’d probably choose the 25% gain.  But is that wise?</p><p>As we’ve shown above, ignoring marginal gains is at best, missing out on significant long term gains, and at worst inviting terminal decline.</p><p>Using an admittedly extreme example, if organisation A and B start with the same £100 of value, and A improves by 1% each day whereas B worsens by 1% each day over the course of 365 days, at the end of the year…</p><p>…A’s value is <strong>1,481x </strong>B’s!</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="879" height="163" src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-18-at-13.25.39.png" alt="Marginal Gains Multiplier" srcset="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-18-at-13.25.39.png 879w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-18-at-13.25.39-300x56.png 300w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-18-at-13.25.39-768x142.png 768w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-18-at-13.25.39-585x108.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 879px) 100vw, 879px" data-src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-18-at-13.25.39.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure></div><p>This is the same reason we don’t all have six pack abs: you have to work at them every day, via diet and exercise, to attain and then maintain them.</p><h4>1% each day requires a long term mindset</h4><p>The difference between being 1% better or worse each day is minimal at first.  But as the above graph and example of organisations A and B demonstrated, these differences accumulate and widen significantly over time.</p><p>Most legal organisations are short-termist, and easily disregard the accumulated benefit of 1% gains over a year.  But doing so is giving away a significant opportunity, or worse, inviting terminal decline if your processes and products trend 1% worse each day and a competitor’s improve 1% per day.</p><h4>Legal (spin)innovation, FOMO and Shiny Objects are easier than 1% each day</h4><p>Legal innovation suffers from three ailments:</p><p>1. <strong>Shiny Object Syndrome (SOS).</strong>  Chasing the latest shiny <strong>#legaltech</strong> simply because it is new and in vogue, or overhyped in the press.</p><p>2. <strong>FOMO.</strong> Buying skills and / or software because of a peer firm’s flashy press release.</p><p>3. <strong>Spinnovation</strong>. Focusing on winning awards and issuing glossy press releases.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="472" src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gollumfire.gif" alt="Gollum Smeagol Ring Lord of the Rings" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption>Buying a no code 5G quantum AI blockchain when what you needed was a lava pit free workspace.</figcaption></figure></div><p>In each case, this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_work">busy work</a>.

Some of the biggest improvements are the accumulation of small wins made consistently.</p><p>As someone famous once said, a six-pack wasn’t built in a day (OK we made that up, but you get the picture).</p><p>So too with legal innovation, let alone any innovation!  It can’t be bought, but only built.  Brick by brick.</p><h3>And this is where marginal gains slot in</h3><p>The marginal gains technique approaches improvement like a marathon, not a sprint.</p><p>It’s not about running full throttle in a short burst, or buying the most expensive running trainers.</p><p>Instead, it’s having the patience to critically and continually assess your diet and form in order to improve, whilst maintaining stamina to keep going for the long term.</p><p>Why bother?</p><p>Focussing on marginal gains – and some techniques to help identify them – may uncover that you already have tools or expertise in your organisation that are under-utilised through lack of awareness, training, buy-in or otherwise.</p><p>Righting these issues can deliver gains without having to buy more things and spread fewer resources across yet more things.</p><p>Likewise, the very issues in your organisation that prevented your existing products or processes from being successfully utilised might also be the very same things that – left unchecked – doom to failure anything new, no matter how shiny or prized by your peers in their spinnovative press release!</p><h2>How to identify, measure and improve via marginal gains?</h2><p>In simple terms: <strong>map your process</strong>.  Identify the pain points. Measure them. Analytically and empirically design, implement, measure and test solutions.  Did it improve? Yes, great.  If not, try again.  Once you get it working, build in controls to ensure the improvements are maintained and new ones identifiable.</p><p>Where are small things eating away at your overall process efficiency?</p><p>If you want a more rigorous framework, you might wish to consider a time tested method such as the Six Sigma concept, <strong>DMAIC</strong>.</p><h3>What’s DMAIC?</h3><p>DMAIC stands for: <strong>define, measure, analyse, improve and control</strong>.</p><p>DMAIC is a five-phase data-driven strategy to improve processes.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2>I Love It! (I Hate It.)</h2><p>There's a sound of rustling paper. You crack the wrap at the seam. You look inside, unveiling the item within. It's...</p><p>Crap. It’s crap. It’s a crap present that you don’t want.</p><p>You lift your head and, with a beaming grin, you <em>somehow</em> manage to let out a torrent of thanks and praise for what you have just received. This is wonderful! It's just what I wanted! How did you know? I love it! I'll treasure it forever!</p><p>Within a day, it's stuffed in a drawer. Within a week, it's forgotten. Within a month, it's on eBay or off to the charity shop. Worse, it just ends up in a landfill somewhere.</p><p>If you had to guess, how many times would you say this has happened to you when you've received gifts at Christmas or on birthdays?</p><p>Here comes the even worse part: now think about how many times this might have happened with gifts<em> that you have given to others.</em></p><p><strong>Think you've got a perfect record?</strong> Think again, because you really, honestly, probably don't.</p><h2>A Lot of Gifts Aren't Actually That Good</h2><p>In 1993 - to cries of 'Grinch!' - economist Joel Waldfogel published a now-infamous paper (among certain economist circles, anyway) titled '<a href="https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/WaldfogelDeadweightLossXmas.pdf">The Deadweight Loss of Christmas</a>'.</p><p>In it, Waldfogel argues that huge sums of money are wasted every year on gifts that nobody really wants. More accurately, he reported that many gift recipients valued their gifts at a dollar amount much lower than was actually paid for the item.</p><p>For example, if I bought you a gift for $100 and you thought that it was actually worth about $70 it would mean that, somewhere along the line, <em>you’ve destroyed $30</em>. Pop! It's gone. You might as well have just taken your cash and burnt it.</p><p>Waldfogel found that anywhere between 10% and 33% of all Christmas gifts cause this kind of loss every year. This is stunning, especially when we extrapolate out to the entire population.</p><p>He concludes by saying that many people could do worse than simply giving cash as a gift because it would carry more value than the actual gifts they might otherwise have bought.</p><p>Unless you are absolutely convinced that you are god's gift to... well, gift-giving, then you're probably seeing the same loss of value with your own gifts. Or, to put it another way, <strong>a lot of your gifts probably suck whether you realise it or not</strong>.</p><p>You won't see this, though, because nobody is going to turn around and tell you that your gifts were 'only 70% good'. If anything, the reactions that we get with a good gift and a bad gift are remarkably similar. Nobody wants to make you feel like a bastard at Christmas, even if you did hand out some absolute clangers.</p><p>But is it so bad, really, losing a few dollars every year? In short, yes. And then some. But not just because of the money you're wasting.</p><h2>Good Gift Giving Is Incredibly Important</h2><p>Outside of bland analysis by economists that ordinary people haven’t heard of, gift-giving helps us maintain and preserve social ties at all of life’s most important occasions; birthdays, Christmas, Valentine's day, anniversaries, graduations... you name it.</p><p>In between these occasions there is usually some kind of imbalance between the gifts that we have given to one another. That is, you might knock it out of the park one year and I might give you something that’s nowhere near as good. Next time, I'm going to want to do much better. This imbalance leads, in part, to the continuation of the tradition.</p><p>Giving good gifts help to form and strengthen social bonds. It helps us show people how much we care, how much we love them. It helps us say sorry. It helps us convey meaning. It helps us have fun and take delight in generosity. A life without giving and receiving gifts would be a dull life indeed.</p><p>On the other hand, giving bad gifts can degrade the quality of those same bonds. <strong>At best, it can be annoying to be given a bad gift. At worst, it can drive people apart.</strong> If Waldfogel's research is correct, an awful lot of us are unwittingly dropping the ball every year, without really realising it.</p><p>Luckily, it's not just economists giving their miserable analysis of the situation; a handful of psychologists have waded in and they're here to tell you that you're just <em>thinking</em> <em>about it all wrong</em>.</p><h2>Why Our Gifts Don't Work</h2><p>There's a surprising amount of research literature out there that all points in a similar direction as to why gifts don't work and what we can do about it. To find a way through this gift-giving minefield, I've gone through some of the most widely-cited papers to get to the bottom of it all. (Citations can be found at the end of this article.)</p><h3>Gift-Givers and Gift-Receivers Think Differently</h3><p>Gifts don't always hit the spot because the psychology of <em>giving</em> gifts is totally different to the psychology of <em>getting</em> gifts. Although it all happens during the same event, we unwittingly think about these two things in totally different ways.</p><p>When people <em>give</em> gifts, they typically want to nail one or more of these four different things:</p><ul role="list"><li>Surprise (the wow factor)</li><li>Desirability (the clout factor)</li><li>Materiality (the price tag)</li><li>Social responsibility (that is, looking virtuous)</li></ul><p>Gift <em>receivers</em>, though? <strong>Their priorities are completely different</strong>. They want:</p><ul role="list"><li>Usefulness (can I do something with it?)</li><li>Versatility (can I do a variety of things with it?)</li><li>Quality (is it well made/going to last?)</li><li>Stuff they've asked for (did I actually say I want this?)</li></ul><p>Given the difference between these two lists, is it any wonder that some gifts simply don't hit the mark?</p><h3>We Focus too Much on The Moment of Exchange</h3><p>When we give gifts we are mostly thinking about 'the moment' in which we hand it over, seeing the reaction of our recipients. We narcissistically want the chorus of 'oohs' and 'aahs' that come with nailing a really good gift that somebody loves. Whether or not those reactions last any longer than the moment of exchange, though, is not something that gift givers really care about.</p><p>Research shows that we make greater errors with gift giving when those gifts are being opened in public - perhaps at a party - than when we give them in private - such as wedding presents.</p><p>This is because<strong> we end up optimising for the maximum showboat potential of the gifts we give</strong> because it feels good to do so well in public. Once the event is over, though, we basically forget about it all. Onto the next thing.</p><p>Not so for the gift recipient. After the party is over and everyone's gone home... they've still got the gift. It matters much more to them what comes <em>after</em> the moment of exchange.</p><p>This means that it's better to buy a gift that has greater long term appeal than just the momentary 'wow' factor, even if it doesn't feel as good to us in the moment.</p><h3>We Like to Be Given Experiences... But We Don't Like to Gift Them</h3><p>Research shows that an 'experience' gift - like a night out at the theatre or a wine tasting course - is often preferred instead of the usual variety of material gifts that get doled out every year.&nbsp;</p><p>The only problem is that gift-givers don't really like to give experiences as gifts because the moment of exchange is relatively dull. This is usually because there's some stand-in that gets handed over - a voucher or a certificate - and the response is likely to be bland at best.</p><p>The <em>real</em> excitement comes much later when they cash that voucher in. But, of course, the gift-giver can’t actually be there to see that happen. No good.</p><h3>We Care too Much About the Price</h3><p>Gift-givers tend to believe that the more generous or pricey a gift is, the better it must be. This rarely works. For recipients, the absolute quality of the gift matters much more. This is equally true for something that the giver thinks is really thoughtful, too.</p><p>This happens when we put an enormous amount of thought and money into a gift for a friend or relative, <strong>only to find that they have no interest in it.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A good example of this might be picking up on someone's love for music and then buying them a beautiful acoustic guitar. There's little guarantee that they have any interest in playing an instrument at all, no matter how expensive it is or how much thought you put into it.</p><p>If they're not regularly playing that thing a year later, you’ve probably goofed.</p><h3>We're Too Distant</h3><p>If you're genuinely quite distant from the gift recipient, it's almost impossible to get a good gift for them that they will genuinely want. This means one of two things:</p><ol role="list"><li>You probably shouldn't bother, or</li><li>You can give them cash (or a cash equivalent)</li></ol><p>Whether or not you <em>should</em> give them cash is another question. If they're your grandchildren this is absolutely fine. If they're your grandparents, perhaps not.</p><p>In the latter instance, a good 'consumable' like a decent bottle of wine or a box of chocolates will do. But don't worry about it much more than that.</p><h3>Be Careful With Charity Gifts</h3><p>Sadly, recipients are less grateful about virtuous charitable gifts than we would hope for. While they're good for the cause, they don't score well against the ways in which we normally value gifts. They make the gift giver look good and they feel good in the moment, but they are not valued as much. </p><p>Of course, if someone tells you that they would value a charitable gift then go for it. But don't assume that anybody will actually like it as a gift unless you have discussed it in advance.</p><h2>How to Buy Gifts People Actually Want</h2><p>All hope is not lost. You <em>shall</em> buy gifts that people will actually want! Here's how.</p><h3>Be Realistic About Your Relationship With The Recipient</h3><p>In Waldfogel's 1993 study, there's a chart of gift effectiveness that more or less screams at aunts, uncles and grandparents to simply not bother with material gifts and to give cash instead:</p><figure id="w-node-9f5a4418121f-c39ae183"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8b192239b9b4843e9ae18f/5fbfe9af234e056f30021f18_GTfsGCvFwKV3s1qidXi6Ls7EIYGoOQBVRr8o_3XvvwZ6IHt4QwNvAaje0p8Il8hWv-Yz1jcRU9A98nTmQMijJOrXU6E6gZC5FSi4_f_WOLuJY2XXZtR2CCIEYZsyAMvYo1P60Hr3.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><p>Are you soulmates, together as a couple for many years? You obviously stand a much higher chance of getting the recipient something they will actually want.</p><p>If you’re anyone else, you will have a harder time and should maybe not worry so much about making sure your gift is as ‘thoughtful’ as possible and just focus on making their gift useful or buying them an experience.</p><h3>...Ask Them What They Want</h3><p>It seems obvious, …</p></div></div></div>

            <!-- content --><p>Years ago, we had a big decision to make. In 2013, STH had grown to a size that would seem immeasurably small by the traffic we do today. Still, at that point, we made the decision that it made fiscal sense to leave Amazon AWS for colocation. We chronicled the reasoning in <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-sky-sth-leaving-cloud-amazon-aws/">Falling From the Sky Why STH is Leaving the Cloud</a> and then the cost breakdown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-sky-part-3-evaluating-amazon-ec2-vps-dedicated-colocation-options/">Falling From the Sky Part 3 – Evaluating Amazon EC2, VPS, Dedicated and Colocation Options</a>. Since 2013, we have been doing some irregular updates that largely correspond to planned upgrades of our infrastructure. Since we are taking a look at a few upgrades again, it is time to go through the exercise again.<span id="more-48850"></span></p>

<p>If you want to hear this instead of just reading, we have a YouTube video with some commentary here:</p>
<p><iframe title="Our Colocation Hosting versus AWS Costs Compared 2020 Edition" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RqetN_i0BnE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, we can go into a bit more detail below, but some prefer to listen rather than read so we have that option.</p>

<p>In 2018, we looked again at whether it was time to move back to the cloud. In our cost analysis, this is what we found using 1-year estimates:</p>
<figure id="attachment_26722" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-26722"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-from-the-sky-part-4-leaving-the-cloud-5-years-later/sth-2018-web-hosting-budget-v-aws/" rel="attachment wp-att-26722"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS.jpg" alt="STH 2018 Web Hosting Budget V AWS" width="536" height="156" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS.jpg 536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS-400x116.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS-533x156.jpg 533w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS-534x156.jpg 534w" sizes="(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-26722">STH 2018 Web Hosting Budget V AWS</figcaption></figure>
<p>Just to give some sense of how that March 2018 estimate has gone in the 32 months since we looked at this, we ended up using:</p>
<ul>
<li>Way more bandwidth. STH has grown a ton since 2018. We also focus more on reviews which tend to use more photos. Even with lazy loading images, our bandwidth usage is significantly higher. This did not incur an incremental cost based on how we buy bandwidth. See: <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/buyers-guide-hosting-bandwidth-data-transfer-billing/">Buyer’s Guide to Hosting: Bandwidth, Data Transfer and Billing</a></li>
<li>Several of our VMs doubled memory requirements and we added slightly more storage. We overprovisioned so this was absorbed with still enough leftover.</li>
<li>We replaced a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/9-step-calm-and-easy-proxmox-ve-boot-drive-failure-recovery/">SSD</a>, upgraded a firewall, and added another <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/explaining-the-automatic-transfer-switching-ats-pdu/">ATS PDU</a>. We have not done long-term infrastructure upgrades.</li>
<li>We ended up using an upgraded node that we had available, as a “hot spare”. We tend to “self-warranty” hardware, and so we had an extra system/ chassis there.</li>
<li>We are going to say we used four hours of labor. This includes drive time to the primary data center. Since it is far away (18-20 minute drive), we actually did not go there for several quarters. So over 32 months, we had budgeted $640 for remote hands. We effectively either paid $160/ hr or paid less than that even rounding up to four hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, it looks like we probably over-estimated self-hosting costs again, and underestimated AWS costs with respect to how much we would spend there, even after service discounts.</p>
<h2>The Late 2020 AWS v. Colocation Update</h2>
<p>We wanted to answer the question of what the picture would look like for hosting STH now. A few quick words before we get there on assumptions.</p>
<p>First off, we completely could change the way we run the site. That is a given. Frankly, running in VMs whether on the cloud or in self-hosting is convenient. Indeed, we run containers in VMs as well. We could also overhaul the entire software stack again, but frankly, we want to spend more time creating content then doing that work. Something that we learned was that we had less reliability by increasing complexity than by keeping things as simple as possible.</p>
<p>Second, we are modeling current data transfer, and a minimal set of VMs. We actually have a lot more running, including some services that we run for some of the labs. One could argue that since they are lab services they are part of bringing you STH, but they are not focused on the web hosting aspect so we are going to remove them. Also, we have other VMs that are likely only online because we wanted to try something and had capacity. We may or may not elect to run the VMs if there was the AWS incremental cost. We could model these as on-demand or spot instances, but instead, we are just removing them entirely.</p>
<p>Third, we completely understand spot pricing. We are modeling a basic set instead of adding extras. At some point, we need databases, nginx servers, and so forth.</p>
<p>Fourth, we are going to add a mix of AMD EPYC and Intel Xeon instances roughly about what we use for our hosting. We are heavily weighting the larger instances toward the EPYC instances since that helps bring down the costs and for our workloads, there is no appreciable difference. We could go Arm, but that requires some small lift and shift work.</p>
<p>Finally, we do use some AWS services. Those services we would use regardless so we are excluding them from the analysis. We are also not modeling services such as Mailchimp which handles our weekly newsletter, Teespring that handles our online merch shop, YouTube which hosts our videos, and so forth.</p>
<h3>AWS Cost 1-Year Reserved No Upfront</h3>
<p>Here is the calculator for the absolute base setup for our hosting using 1-year reserved upfront instances:</p>
<figure id="attachment_48851" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48851"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-from-the-sky-2020-self-hosting-still-pays/2020-aws-calculator-1-year-reserved-no-upfront/" rel="attachment wp-att-48851"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront.jpg" alt="2020 AWS Calculator 1 Year Reserved No Upfront" width="1114" height="222" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront.jpg 1114w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront-400x80.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront-800x159.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront-696x139.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront-1068x213.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1114px) 100vw, 1114px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48851">2020 AWS Calculator 1 Year Reserved No Upfront</figcaption></figure>
<p>As you can see, our hosting costs are just under $4,300 per month.</p>
<h3>AWS Cost 1-Year Reserved Partial Upfront</h3>
<p>Swapping to 1-year reserved partial up-front on the instances helps bring pricing down a bit albeit with a $19,512 up-front cost.</p>

<p>When we factor in the up-front we get a $4,137.63 monthly cost along with a $49,651.56 total annual cost for the year. We are not discounting here using future values/ present values. There is a big issue with this. Typically, we tend to see our servers run for years. To model that, we tend to use 3-year reserved partial upfront.</p>
<h3>AWS Cost 3-Year Reserved Partial Upfront</h3>
<p>Using the 3-year reserved partial upfront on the instances gives us a much lower operating cost with a larger up-front payment.</p>

<p>First off, the $39,020 is more than we have spent in the last three years on hosting hardware. We do not purchase machines with long warranties or high markups, so if you are buying the average Dell/ HPE/ Lenovo server and think that sounds like a single server, you are trading higher upfront costs for service contracts. Given what we have seen on hardware/ remote hands, it is not a model we are pursuing. On the operating side, we get down to $1,968.51 per month which is great.</p>
<h2>STH 2020 Hosting Budget</h2>
<p>Next year, we will likely do two small changes. First, we will upgrade database nodes and instead of using Optane SSDs, we will move to Cascade Lake and Optane PMem DIMMs into the database servers and upgrade a few older nodes to AMD EPYC 7002 “Rome” systems. We are testing the Ampere Altra 80-core server right now, and we are at the point where we might consider using Arm in the hosting cluster this year. We are going to increase our hardware budget to $10,000 this year. Although we did not use most of our hardware budget in 2019 nor 2020, we expect to in 2021.</p>
<p>Making up our monthly cost, we increased a bit for inflation. We used a $895/ mo budget in 2018. Our costs are effectively flat, but we are going to assume a bit more labor to install servers/ upgrade the hardware.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48855" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48855"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-from-the-sky-2020-self-hosting-still-pays/2020-aws-v-self-hosting/" rel="attachment wp-att-48855"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-v-Self-Hosting.jpg" alt="2020 AWS V Self Hosting" width="685" height="197" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-v-Self-Hosting.jpg 685w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-v-Self-Hosting-400x115.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48855">2020 AWS V Self Hosting</figcaption></figure>
<p>We are budgeting $22,000 per year or around $1833.33 per month. This is about the same as we would need for EC2’s 3-year partial upfront reserved instance, albeit without the up-front costs.</p>
<p>The one item that skews this substantially, is that we are not replacing every node every year. We are now in a very different place than we were when we started this journey. We have existing infrastructure that is frankly fine from a performance and node count standpoint even though we have relatively under-invested over the past 32 months. We had budgeted around $1687/ month for the last two months and spent under $1000. Still, at some point, we like to replace equipment before it fails.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>There is clearly a lot going into this. We now have just under 8 years since this 10U colocation spot in Las Vegas was our first setup:</p>

<p>What is not reflected in our discussion is all of the lessons learned along the way. Also, as hardware has gotten faster, and memory prices have decreased, the cost of self-hosting has gone down significantly for our applications. We are also taking advantage of falling bandwidth prices. While AWS is absolutely the right choice for many applications, and indeed we use them, for our web hosting it is not what we want for a simple and inexpensive setup. This may not be the perfect analysis, but it is a little bit of how we now look at hosting at STH.</p>

December 1, 2020 | https://promlabs.com/blog/2020/11/26/an-update-on-promql-compatibility-across-vendors | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://promlabs.com/blog/2020/11/26/an-update-on-promql-compatibility-across-vendors">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Prometheus's query language <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/">PromQL</a> is one of the cornerstones of the Prometheus ecosystem. Back in our August blog post, <a href="https://promlabs.com/blog/2020/08/06/comparing-promql-correctness-across-vendors">Comparing PromQL Correctness Across Vendors</a>, we looked at several external projects and monitoring vendors that claimed to offer PromQL-compatible APIs. Using an <a href="https://github.com/promlabs/promql-compliance-tester">open-source compliance checker tool</a>, we evaluated each implementation by running a set of test queries against both the native Prometheus server and the vendor implementation. As a result, we found multiple bugs in the tested projects, and mapped out in detail how each deviated from the upstream implementation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, more vendors have entered the PromQL space, while existing projects have worked on improving their PromQL support as a result of our last blog post. Today, we are presenting an updated set of PromQL test results both for existing projects and a couple of new ones. We tested each of these implementations against the latest Prometheus version, <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.23.0">v2.23.0</a>.</p>
<h3 id="before-we-start-a-note-on-interpreting-test-scores"><a href="#before-we-start-a-note-on-interpreting-test-scores" aria-label="before we start a note on interpreting test scores permalink"></a>Before we start: a note on interpreting test scores</h3>
<p>When looking at individual test results, please note that the numeric scores alone paint a limited picture. They don't necessarily tell you how impactful implementation errors are, nor how many distinct behavioral differences there are. Since PromQL expressions naturally compose and build on top of each other, it is infeasible to isolate all possible query errors into fully independent test cases. Many of the test queries will contain the same constructs as other queries, in a nested way. For example: If an implementation selects data incorrectly, then this breaks not only a simple data selection test query, but also all other test query cases that try to run a function, operator, or other transformation based on selected data. The test cases also include a lot of variations of the same type of query, but with different ranges, quantile values, or other parameters. So if e.g. a function is broken in a general way, it may cause multiple test case variants to fail at the same time.</p>
<p>Another matter of more subtle interpretation are vendor extensions and extreme edge-case behavior. For example, a vendor may choose to not raise an error when executing a function with a parameter value that is illegal in native PromQL, but legal and sensical in the extended language. Or a vendor may return a different value for an unusual edge-case behavior, such as running <code>histogram_quantile()</code> with a quantile value larger than <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>We still provide the numeric test scores as a quick way to map out the vendor landscape and to motivate the ecosystem towards achieving a 100% score. But if you need to understand behavioral differences in more depth, please <a href="https://promlabs.com/promql-compliance-tests">take a look at the full test results</a> and read on for the details.</p>
<h3 id="criteria-for-including-a-vendor-in-tests"><a href="#criteria-for-including-a-vendor-in-tests" aria-label="criteria for including a vendor in tests permalink"></a>Criteria for including a vendor in tests</h3>
<p>We are always on the lookout for new PromQL implementations to include in these tests. To include a project or vendor, we look for two criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone is either advertising full or partial PromQL compatibility of their system, and/or otherwise positioning their solution as a drop-in replacement for an existing PromQL implementation.</li>
<li>For practical purposes, we need to be able to ingest test data into the system and query it back via a PromQL-style HTTP API. Otherwise, we can't run any tests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, some vendors failed the second criterium for now, so we couldn't include them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sysdig.com/">Sysdig</a> <a href="https://docs.sysdig.com/en/using-promql.html">advertises PromQL support</a>, but has no <code>remote_write</code> protocol support to ingest arbitrary test data. According to contacts at Sysdig, <code>remote_write</code> may be supported at some point in the future, but we couldn't get a recent update on its availability timeline.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.vmware.com/de/company/acquisitions/wavefront.html">Wavefront</a> <a href="https://docs.wavefront.com/wavefront_prometheus.html">advertises partial PromQL support</a>, but they lack an HTTP endpoint against which to run test queries. Their PromQL support is only available within their own user interface so far, which makes it difficult to test against. However, judging by the various compatibility caveats listed in their documentation, we do not expect that they would reach a high test score if we could test them.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope to be able to test even more vendors in the future.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> After publishing, we received questions about PromQL support in two more vendors:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb/">InfluxDB</a> once <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/promql">started implementing PromQL support</a> (coincidentally with the help of the author of this blog post), but as far as we are aware, this effort has been paused and PromQL support in InfluxDB is neither currently available nor is it being advertised.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elastic</a> recently <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-metrics-7-7-0-released">advertised PromQL support in Elastic Metrics</a>. However, the announced feature is only about Elastic Metrics being able to run queries against an <em>existing</em> external PromQL endpoint (such as Prometheus) to then ingest the query result as metrics into Elasticsearch. There is no way to run PromQL on the resulting data stored in Elasticsearch itself.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minor-updates-to-the-test-query-set"><a href="#minor-updates-to-the-test-query-set" aria-label="minor updates to the test query set permalink"></a>Minor updates to the test query set</h3>
<p>Since the last testing round in August, we made minor changes to the test query set:</p>
<ul>
<li>For queries that looked at the absolute values of counter metrics (e.g. with no <code>rate()</code> or similar counter-related function applied), we changed the selected metrics to be gauges instead. This helps keep test cases somewhat more independent for a vendor like New Relic, which does not support storing or retrieving absolute values for counters.</li>
<li>We added a query selecting an intermittently present series to test whether <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#staleness">staleness handling</a> works.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lets-get-started-updated-comparisons"><a href="#lets-get-started-updated-comparisons" aria-label="lets get started updated comparisons permalink"></a>Let's get started: Updated comparisons</h3>
<p>In this round of tests, we tested the following projects and vendors, in alphabetical order:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chronosphere.io/">Chronosphere</a> - A hosted monitoring and observability platform.</li>
<li><a href="https://cortexmetrics.io/">Cortex</a> - An open-source, horizontally scalable reimplementation of Prometheus.</li>
<li><a href="https://grafana.com/products/cloud/">Grafana Cloud</a> - A hosted monitoring and observability service.</li>
<li><a href="https://m3db.io/">M3</a> - An open-source metrics engine and time series database.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.metricfire.com/">MetricFire</a> - A hosted monitoing and observability service.</li>
<li><a href="https://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a> - A hosted monitoring and observability service.</li>
<li><a href="https://thanos.io/">Thanos</a> - An open-source project to provide query aggregation for long-term storage and HA on top of Prometheus.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/timescale/promscale">Promscale</a> (<a href="https://www.timescale.com/">TimescaleDB</a>) - An open-source project to store Prometheus data in TimescaleDB.</li>
<li><a href="https://victoriametrics.com/">VictoriaMetrics</a> - An open-source time-series database and monitoring system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look at the test results for each of these systems:</p>
<h4 id="chronosphere"><a href="#chronosphere" aria-label="chronosphere permalink"></a>Chronosphere</h4>
<p>Chronosphere does not have a self-service account creation system yet, but they helpfully provided us with a test account with <code>remote_write</code> and PromQL HTTP API support. Chronosphere is built on top of M3 (tested below), so we expected similar test results for the two. After an initial test run against an outdated test environment using an older M3 version, Chronosphere updated our test account and we achieved a test score of <strong>100%</strong> against it.</p>
<h4 id="cortex"><a href="#cortex" aria-label="cortex permalink"></a>Cortex</h4>
<p>Last time we tested Cortex we encountered two minor issues: floating-point input timestamps were <a href="https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/issues/2932">not rounded in the same way</a> as in Prometheus, and the system did not <a href="https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/issues/416">support executing queries without a metric name</a>. The first issue has been resolved entirely, while the second one is being addressed by a new storage mode in Cortex - the new <a href="https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/blocks-storage/">blocks storage mode</a> vs. the older <a href="https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/chunks-storage/">chunks storage mode</a>.</p>
<p>Let's look at <a href="https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/releases/tag/v1.5.0">version 1.5.0 of Cortex</a> and see what scores each of these modes received:</p>
<h6 id="cortex-with-chunks-storage"><a href="#cortex-with-chunks-storage" aria-label="cortex with chunks storage permalink"></a>Cortex with chunks storage</h6>
<p>When testing Cortex with the old chunks storage, we can now remove the query tweak to align input timestamps, since that bug has been fixed. Other than that, we still get the same test score of <strong>99.62%</strong> due to the chunks mode not supporting queries without metric names.</p>
<h6 id="cortex-with-blocks-storage"><a href="#cortex-with-blocks-storage" aria-label="cortex with blocks storage permalink"></a>Cortex with blocks storage</h6>
<p>Cortex with blocks storage mode now also does not require any query tweaks anymore and passes with a score of <strong>100%</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="grafana-cloud"><a href="#grafana-cloud" aria-label="grafana cloud permalink"></a>Grafana Cloud</h4>
<p>Grafana Cloud is a new test candidate that <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/metrics/prometheus/">advertises full hosted Prometheus functionality</a>. Under the hood, Grafana Cloud uses Cortex to offer this service. According to representatives from Grafana Labs, they are in the process of phasing out the last (shared) chunks-based Cortex cluster, while all new Cortex clusters are already using blocks as their storage mode.</p>
<p>To be able to cache PromQL queries, Grafana Cloud aligns incoming query start and end timestamps to the query resolution step width (10 seconds in our case). This is currently not configurable on the Grafana Cloud side, so we had to apply a cross-cutting query tweak to align input timestamps to our reference Prometheus server in the same way, to get comparable results.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we tested a Grafana Cloud account via <code>remote_write</code> and their Prometheus-style HTTP query API on both the remaining legacy cluster and a new dedicated blocks-storage cluster, and we got the same <strong>99.62%</strong> and <strong>100%</strong> test scores as for Cortex itself. Since the chunks-mode cluster is being retired this month, we count that as an overall <strong>100%</strong> score for Grafana Cloud.</p>
<h4 id="m3"><a href="#m3" aria-label="m3 permalink"></a>M3</h4>
<p>M3 is also a new candidate in this group that states, "M3 can be used as Prometheus Remote Storage and has 100% PromQL compatibility", <a href="https://m3db.io/">on its homepage</a>. Its documentation also mentions <a href="https://m3db.github.io/m3/integrations/prometheus/">Prometheus and PromQL integrations</a> that include <code>remote_write</code> support and a PromQL HTTP API endpoint. Using these with M3 version v1.0.0, we ran our test suite and received a test score of <strong>100%</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For PromQL to work 100% the same as in Prometheus, we had to ensure that our test query was only hitting raw, non-aggregated data in M3 (vs. data that has been downsampled into a lower resolution). We did this by not configuring any aggregation in our test M3 database.</p>
<h4 id="metricfire"><a href="#metricfire" aria-label="metricfire permalink"></a>MetricFire</h4>
<p>MetricFire, a hosted service by the people behind <a href="https://www.hostedgraphite.com/">hostedgraphite.com</a>, is still pretty new in the Prometheus space. While MetricFire documents how to write data into the system using the <code>remote_write</code> protocol, there is no officially supported way to run external PromQL queries against the collected data using an HTTP API yet. However, MetricFire representatives kindly explained a way to do this. We won't detail it here, but we expect that there will be a documented public HTTP API soon. In our talks with MetricFire we learned that they also use Cortex to back their service, and we also …</p></div></div>

        <strong>Rebase</strong> is a new conference for and by practitioners who want to engage academics about tomorrow's technologies while fondly recalling the achievements of yesterday.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This year, <strong>Rebase</strong> was planned to occur twice, once in Berlin
        with the <a href="https://2020.ecoop.org/">ECOOP</a> conference and
        once in Chicago with the <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/">SPLASH</a> conference.
        Due to outside forces, there will be a single virtual event.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Rebase</strong> will use the Clowdr platform for interaction,
        registration allows attendees to ask questions and meet with each other
        and with speaker. Registration also give access to all of the
        <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/">SPLASH</a> co-located events.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Rebase is free. All talks were streamed live and are now available on <br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyrlk8Xaylp6aNlOgiyE4W30X7DpXx74m"><i></i>&nbsp;YouTube</a>.</strong>

<p>
No Starch Press is publishing a book based on this website in early 2021. Stay tuned!
</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> This book will <em>not</em> teach you how to use OpenGL or DirectX; instead, it can teach you how OpenGL and DirectX <em>work</em>. In practice you won’t write a software renderer for production use, but understanding how and why a renderer works will let you use OpenGL and DirectX more effectively.</p>
<p>Computer Graphics is a fascinating topic - how do you make <em>Toy Story</em> out of algorithms and some geometric data? Interestingly enough, it’s a mysterious topic not only for the average cinema fan, but also for world-class engineers who just haven’t been exposed to it.</p>
<p>Computer Graphics is also a frighteningly broad topic. From 3D rendering to photographic image filters, from fonts to particle systems, there’s a multitude of disciplines that can be categorized under CG. This work focuses exclusively on 3D rendering.</p>
<p><strong>Computer Graphics from scratch</strong> is my humble attempt to demystify that slice of Computer Graphics in an accessible way. It can be easily understood by high-school students, while covering the same topics of an university course. It is, in fact, based on my years of teaching the subject at my university.</p>
<p>There’s little pre-requisite knowledge, nor hardware or software dependencies. The only primitive used in the book is a method that lets us set the color of a pixel - hence <strong>“from scratch”</strong>. The algorithms are conceptually simple, and the math is straightforward. There is some high-school level trigonometry. There’s some basic Linear Algebra as well, but I’m including an appendix that can be consulted as necessary.</p>
<p>This work is divided in two main parts, <strong>Raytracing</strong> and <strong>Rasterization</strong>, which focus on the two main ways to make pretty pictures out of data. The <strong>Common concepts</strong> chapter introduces some basic knowledge necessary to understand these two parts.</p>
<p>The focus of this work is not on performance, but on clear conceptual exposition. The sample code is, well, <em>sample code</em>, written in the most <em>clear</em> way possible, which may not be the most <em>efficient</em> way to implement the algorithms. Where there are different ways to do something, I’ve chosen the easiest to understand.</p>
<p>The “end result” of this work is two complete, fully functional renderers: a raytracer and a rasterizer. Although they follow very different approaches, they produce similar results when used to render a simple scene:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/comparison-1.png">
</figure>
<p>While their sets of features have considerable overlap, they aren’t identical, so this book covers their specific strengths:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/comparison-2.png">
</figure>
<p>The book provides sample code throughout the text, as somewhat informal pseudocode; it also provides fully working implementations written in JavaScript that can run directly on your browser, rendering to a <code>canvas</code> element.</p>
<h2 id="why-read-this">Why read this?</h2>
<p>This work should give you all the knowledge necessary to write software renderers. Although in the age of GPUs few people have good reasons to write a pure software renderer, the experience of writing one is valuable for the following reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Shaders</strong>. The first GPUs had their algorithms hardcoded in hardware, but in modern ones you’re expected to write your own shaders. In other words, you’re still implementing big chunks of rendering software, except it now runs on the GPU.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Understanding</strong>. Whether you’re using a fixed pipeline or writing your own shaders, <em>understanding</em> what’s going on behind the scenes lets you use the fixed pipeline better and write better shaders.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fun</strong>. Few areas of Computer Science have the kind of immediately visible results offered by Computer Graphics. The sense of accomplishment you get when your SQL query runs just right is <em>nothing</em> compared to what you feel the first time you get ray traced reflections right. I taught Computer Graphics at my university for 5 years. I often wondered why I enjoyed teaching the same thing semester after semester for so long; in the end, what made it worth it was seeing the faces of my students light up and use their first renders as desktop backgrounds.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="work-in-progress">Work in progress</h2>
<p>This is a work in progress. Here’s a non-exhaustive to do list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Texture filtering</li>
<li>Normal mapping</li>
<li>Textures in the raytracer</li>
<li>Shadows in the rasterizer (stencil and shadow maps)</li>
<li>Reflection in the rasterizer</li>
<li>Expand the CSG and Refraction sections into chapters</li>
<li>Linear algebra appendix</li>
<li>Make demos interactive</li>
<li>Clean up demo code</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m a senior software engineer at Google.

<p>I taught Computer Graphics for five years at university, where it was a semester-long third-year subject. I am grateful to all of my students, who served as unwitting guinea pigs for the materials that inspired this book.</p>

December 1, 2020 | https://spotify.design/article/designing-data-science-tools-at-spotify | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://spotify.design/article/designing-data-science-tools-at-spotify">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Spotify operates at a massive scale: We have millions of listeners whose activities generate huge amounts of raw data. Raw data by itself is not that helpful though; we need to be able to process, manage, and distill it into insights that can inform new features or improvements to the experience. And to do that, we need usable, well-designed tools that ensure these insights can be easily understood.</p><div><p>Up until recently, the tools Spotify’s data scientists used every day were designed mostly by engineers. There was no one dedicated to looking at the problems data scientists were experiencing holistically. This meant that a lot of the time, the tools were strung together with inefficient hacky workarounds.</p><p>Throughout the past year, a design team was created to rethink the existing stack and weed out these bad practices.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m a product designer in the R&amp;D Community at Spotify, and I’ve been working in the data tools space for about a year — which makes me one of the longest-serving designers in the team. I was brought in to pair up with engineering squads working on platforms and experiences for data scientists. Most recently, I helped to create and launch a new data science tool that would expedite insights production, and eliminate those old, inefficient ways of working.</p><h3>Hierarchy of needs</h3><p>Before I get into the nitty-gritty of how we designed this new data science tool, it helps to understand how data scientists transform raw data into usable insights.&nbsp;</p><p>In her post for Hacker Noon, Monica Rogati explains <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-ai-hierarchy-of-needs-18f111fcc007" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><i>The AI Hierarchy of Needs</i></u></a>. This is the idea that<strong> </strong>there are many steps between getting data and using it for business.&nbsp;</p></div><div><figure><div><div></div></div></figure><p>The Data Science Hierarchy of Needs outlines the steps between getting data and using it for business. </p></div><div><p>First, they need to collect the right data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Then they need to process that data.&nbsp;</p><p>Only when it has been processed can it be analyzed and explored.&nbsp;</p><h3>Existing landscape</h3><p>When we started thinking about how to do this at Spotify, there were already some tools in use:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BigQuery</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a Google data warehouse product with a web user interface where data scientists can store and process data. They can write queries here to make sure they have the right dataset for their question.</p><p><strong>Jupyter Notebooks&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Often simply called “notebooks.” Notebooks are an open source interactive workspace for running code in blocks mixed with prose.&nbsp;</p><p>After Data Scientists use the BigQuery UI to validate their dataset, they use local notebooks to find insights, create visualizations, which explain the findings, and share their work (among other tasks).</p><p><strong>ScienceBox&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This is an internal Spotify command line interface tool to help speed up the way Data Scientists use notebooks. It’s commonly used as a way to organize files into projects, pre-install data science libraries, and create a standardized and reproducible data analysis workflow.&nbsp;</p><p>
These tools worked well for small datasets, but as data scientists were expected to work with bigger and bigger datasets, however, they had to wait longer to see the results of their code. If we expect data scientists at Spotify to find high-impact insights from the huge amounts of data we collect every day, they need tools to help create high-quality insights at high speeds.</p><h3>Our design challenge</h3><p>By the time I got involved in the project, the basic framework for the plan had already been established. ScienceBox was going to be rebuilt with a UI in the cloud, allowing us to unlock cloud computing benefits such as scalability, high-speed processing, and infrastructure flexibility.&nbsp;</p><p>We hypothesized that improving this tool by adding processing power, scaling discoverability, and using cloud infrastructure, we could help data scientists analyze data more efficiently, improve collaboration, and reduce the time to find insights in data.</p><p>To start off, I caught up on all the research conducted so far, and mapped out the existing workflow so we could clearly see the changes we needed to make. With the help of a visual workflow, we saw that we could group the type of work into two main types — “ad hoc querying” (i.e. quickly querying data to find immediate answers), and “long-term investigations” (structured projects with month-long timelines).&nbsp;</p><p>I then segmented our users into targeted groups so we could make user-informed design decisions for the workflows we identified. Below is a sample flow for a data scientist running an ad hoc analysis.</p></div><div><figure><div><div></div></div></figure><p>A visual workflow showing various products a user had to interact with to complete a task</p></div><div><h3>What we learned&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p>In rebuilding a crucial tool like ScienceBox in the cloud, we learned 3 important lessons along the way that informed our approach and ultimately led to a more effective tool. They were:</p><ol><li><p>Quick actions make life easier</p></li><li><p>Design for discoverability</p></li><li><p>Highly variable workflows are normal
</p></li></ol><p><strong>Quick actions make life easier</strong></p><p>When we started this project, we watched many data scientists use existing analysis tools to learn how these tools were used. We learned a lot about the limitations of these tools in the context of their work. For example, we learned that if data scientists were conducting analysis locally, it could take up all of their laptops' computational resources. This meant they couldn’t use their laptops for other tasks, and they often ended up running their queries overnight. It also meant that analysis running throughout the day could involve <i>a lot</i> of waiting.
</p><p>Our decision to create a cloud product would allow data scientists to add processing power by running code in the cloud, rather than on their laptops. They would use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>virtual machines (VMs)</u></a>, an emulation of a separate computer system, to speed up the time it takes to run code. These VMs range from standard size (standard speeds) to large size types (extra-high speed and memory). With these VM types, data scientists could free up their laptops for other tasks, run multiple jobs at once, and run each job faster.&nbsp;
</p><p>There was one catch: Our internal interface would mainly function as the launchpad into the web-based interactive development environment, JupyterLab notebooks (the next generation of notebooks), in a new browser tab.
</p><p>All the data analysis and processing work would take place in these notebooks, but since each one needed a virtual machine to power it, every data scientist had to use our separate internal tool at the start of each project to add those resources.&nbsp;
</p><p>Our challenge was to design a product that enabled data scientists to access notebooks as quickly as possible.</p><p>Initially, we thought that data scientists would choose a notebook project before deciding what size the VM powering that notebook should be (the bigger the virtual machine, the higher the speed and memory capacity).&nbsp;
</p><p>This reasoning meant that the VM controls were considered a secondary action, which we hid in a slide-out side panel. However, after user testing, the team and I learned that this hypothesis was incorrect. Controlling the VM was actually one of the main needs in the ScienceBox Cloud UI, so it needed to be front and center.</p><p>
To solve this, we iterated based on the user testing results and added a VM control as a "quick action" in line with the notebook project name.</p></div><div><p>This worked better than expected. As a workflow shortcut, it allowed users to immediately jump in and work without thinking about how to administer their VMs. Additionally, the status of the machine served as a quick way to sort active projects, so that users could visualize which projects they were working on.&nbsp;
</p><p><strong>Design for discoverability</strong></p><p>When we were researching, we learned that the many notebooks scattered across Spotify meant it was hard to locate past work.</p><p>
In our solution, since we believed that data scientists needed access to only their team’s work, we first decided to limit the search results by auto-populating every data scientist's account.</p><p>However, we quickly learned our initial assumption was incorrect. We found that Spotify data scientists often worked across teams and needed access to a wide variety of past work. The data owners they needed to talk to were often on different teams.&nbsp;
</p><p>We pivoted, focusing on increasing the discoverability of notebooks to improve collaboration.<strong> </strong>That meant displaying every findable notebook in our database, enabling users to search and discover notebooks created by others in addition to their own past work. Mapping different discovery flows became important. By visualizing workflows and user journeys, I helped the team understand what changes could have the biggest impact.&nbsp;</p></div><div><figure><div><div></div></div></figure><p>A workflow showing how feature changes would affect the user experience</p></div><div><p><strong>Highly variable workflows are normal</strong></p><p>At first, we thought it would be simple to find a typical workflow among all our users. However, we learned that, while all data scientists want to get insights from data, there are many ways to reach that goal. Some run one-off queries to test hypotheses, others are embedded in month-long projects that require complicated analysis.&nbsp;
</p><p>Instead of forcing one flow on everyone, I designed an interface structure that was flexible enough to accommodate a dense amount of variable information, while highlighting a few primary actions.</p><p>We knew that the users were mainly visiting our platform to launch their notebook tool, so our quick actions had a large “Open” button that brought them directly to their coding environment. For notebooks without a VM, we made it easy for users to add one. For the layout, we created sortable columns and expandable drawers to empower the user to arrange the information to their liking.</p></div><div><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>This is one of the most exciting products I’ve designed at Spotify. While it was challenging to create a product that served our many discovered use cases, it was also highly rewarding.</p><p>Firstly, ScienceBox Cloud has become highly successful. By having designers dedicated to creating a better experience for data scientists, we eliminated those old inefficient practices and allowed them to run their code up to 50% faster than before.&nbsp;
</p><p>Secondly, throughout the …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In Segmentâ€™s early days, we hit countless problems as a founding team. And at the time, I thought those problems were unique to our own special snowflake of a founding journey. I chalked it up to us being new grads and first-time founders.</p><p>But as I've worked with more and more startups, I've realized just how wrong I was.</p><p>Over the past five years, I've made about 25 different seed-stage investments. In doing so, it's taught me a <em>LOT</em> about the common errors that startup founders make. Even across different industries and levels of experience, I see founders hitting the exact same set of problems we encountered in the early days of Segment!</p><p>This post shares a handful of the top lessons that benefit todayâ€™s early stage founders. Itâ€™s a list of the things I wish weâ€™d figured out earlier at Segment. [1]</p><p>This sounds incredibly boring... but the #1 mistake I see startups making is that they donâ€™t set goals. If you take one thing from this post, it's that you should set goals for where you want to be.</p><p>For the longest time at Segment, we didn't have goals. We moved ahead in various (often random) directions, and we would launch features consistently... but we never really set goals at all.</p><p>As we grew the company, we started to lose momentum. Teams were spending time on a bunch of stuff that frankly just didn't really matter to the overall business.</p><p>It wasn't until we hired our VP Eng, Tido, that we finally started setting focused and audacious product goals. Just by verbalizing where we wanted to go and then grading our results, our velocity improved by an order of magnitude.</p><p>I don't care if you call them OKRs, sprints, or something else entirely. Just set a deadline when you want to have something done and a metric you want to move or some other concrete result.</p><p>When early stage founders do attempt to set goals, I often see them agonize over what specific goals to choose. In practice, a "pretty good goal" is way better than "no goals at all". Perfect is the enemy of good.</p><p>If you don't yet have product-market fit, your goal should probably be getting your first 3-5 customers using the product. If you've hit the level where you now have dozens of users, your goal should be growing by an order of magnitude. It's better to get in the habit of setting and driving towards goals rather than being too worried about their exact semantics. Worst case, you just pick a better goal later.</p><p>A great set of goals answers the question: <em><strong>"what would have to be true in order for us to feel good about our progress at the end of the month?"</strong></em><em> [2]</em></p><p>If each teammate can independently answer "what are our goals for the month?" in the same way, you'll know you've succeeded. If youâ€™re looking for prior art, read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221">Measure What Matters</a>. </p><p>If you strictly focus on making things true by a certain date, you are bound to make at least some progress towards your end result. </p><p>At the end of the day, every billion-dollar startup is really just the sum of many small deltas.</p><p>Let's get one thing straight: your investors won't know everything. But investors won't know <em>anything</em> if you don't keep them updated on how things are going.</p><p>For the longest time, we were fearful of our Segment investors, to the point that we wouldn't bother sending them emails unless they asked about us. I can say now with confidence that this was 100% the wrong approach.</p><p>We worried that investors would think that we were screwing up (true) and failing (true as well!). And while that might be the case, a founder-friendly investor won't think that way. Investors, especially angels, invested because they believe in <em>you</em>. If I didn't think a team would go somewhere, I wouldn't put money in.</p><p>With each investor, <strong>include the goals you're working towards, as well as the asks for them</strong>. I think monthly is about the right cadence for this in the early days, moving to quarterly around Series A/B time when you start partnering more with a few board members.</p><p>Simply writing the updates should clarify your own thinking tremendously. If it takes you more than 1-2h to put together an update on the most important things happening at the company, it's probably a sign that you should be doing more thinking about the big picture.</p><p>When asking for help, the things that our investors have been able to help us with evolved quite a bit over time. But here's a good rule of thumb for what to ask for:</p><ul><li><p><u>Seed/Pre-seed</u>: user-testing, intros to beta users, hiring</p></li><li><p><u>Series A</u>: hiring, early customers, go-to-market</p></li><li><p><u>Series B/C+</u>: comparables at other companies, senior/exec hires, specific expertise around things like management, infrastructure, systems, etc.</p></li></ul><p>Not all investors will be able to help with everything. But at the very least, sending them information will help you be top of mind. I've lost track of how many times a moment of serendipity where I'm catching up with an old friend has led to a meaningful conversation for a company I've invested in.</p><p>As an extra bonus, the strongest startups send these updates to everyone on their team. It's amazing how much putting the goals in writing helps everyone stay on the same page about what's most important.</p><p>One other note here: take pictures. I now wish we had far more pictures of Segment at every stage of the company. They help turn investor updates into cherished memories.</p><p>Okay, this lesson is taken directly from the YC playbook. And YET, I see so many founders (including YC founders) fail to launch their product. </p><p>If no one notices your launch... just ignore it and then launch again. If you're doing things right, you'll never run out of stuff to launch! [3]</p><p>Why is launching so important? Let me share a personal story...</p><p>We spent about 1.5 years building different iterations of analytics tools. For every iteration, we had a waitlist that users could sign up to use. We personally reached out to the users who we thought were the best fits, and then tried to set up time to use the product. </p><p>The result? Nobody cared. We had no users. We never launched. </p><p>When we finally launched Segment in it's current incarnation, we threw out that approach entirely. We put up a self-service flow, and let anyone who wanted to sign up for it.</p><p>That's when something strange happened... we attracted an entirely new set of developers who just were crawling out of the woodwork and excited to use the new product we'd built. They were coming from companies far outside of SV that we'd never heard of.</p><p>It floored me.</p><p><strong>Lesson learned: the people you happen to be talking to now are probably not the people who have the biggest problem in your space. Do everything you can to reach the folks with the biggest problem, and then, reduce any barriers they might encounter.</strong></p><p>I expect a bunch of you reading this post to ignore this advice, just like we did in the early days. It takes a certain confidence to launch something you've built and put it out there for the world to see. Ultimately though, the rewards are worth it. You'll see users coming from communities you've never even heard of.</p><p>Let me tell you a tale of two startups.</p><p><strong>Startup A</strong> is constantly putting up interesting content on their blog. Their founders are sharing product launches, engineering posts, and creatively brainstorming about what it takes to solve problems in their market.</p><p><strong>Startup B</strong> is operating in stealth. You can't find much about them online, but one of the founders reached out with a nice personalized email mentioning their funding by a top-tier VC. </p><p>Suppose you're looking for a job... do you pick Startup A or Startup B? In my experience, A almost always wins. Momentum is a compounding force.</p><p><strong>Unless you are working in a space that heavily depends on IP, you should probably be publishing more content about what you are doing.</strong> This could be open source, it could be a weekly newsletter, it could be a changelog. [4]</p><p>Whatever it is, it's going to help you both hire <em>and</em> attract customers. So much of the internet is merely about consuming, that just by putting ideas out there, youâ€™ll have a leg up on the competition.</p><p>In the early days of Segment, our <a href="https://segment.com/blog/show-hn-to-series-d/">user acquisition was powered by open source projects and blog posts</a>. But I've seen founders have success with Twitter, Substacks, Podcasts and a variety of different channels.</p><p>If you're looking for inspiration, the <a href="https://railway.app/changelog">Railway</a> and <a href="https://linear.app/changelog">Linear</a> changelogs are epic examples. Companies like <a href="https://baremetrics.com/blog/i-sold-baremetrics">Baremetrics</a> and <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/shareholder-update-q2-2020-and-july/">Buffer</a> differentiated themselves by just being open and honest. <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/globe">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-feature-the-making-of-the-new-auto-layout/">Figma's blogs</a> not only share what they build, but how they built it.</p><p>There are three big inputs that all startups need to continue growing</p><ol><li><p>product capabilities</p></li><li><p>customers and users</p></li><li><p>hiring</p></li></ol><p>I've put them in roughly the order that most teams encounter them. </p><p>Startups begin with a small product that has a modicum of utility. It starts attracting a handful of customers organically. And as more and more customers start using the product, the founders realize that they need extra help to stay on top of all of those requests.</p><p>Remember though, the real goal here is #2. Itâ€™s not the size of your team, itâ€™s the value youâ€™re able to provide to the world. [5]</p><p>I see hiring a big team before you have product-market fit as a red flag. If the company doesn't yet have a set direction, it's going to be harder to pivot with 10 people than it is with 3.</p><p>But, I've worked with startups who have traction and runway... and just seem to be spinning their wheels under load from existing customers.</p><p>I get it.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>I think the title tells a lot about the story I’m going to tell you.</p>
<p>This is not a technical documentation for how I migrated from macOS to FreeBSD. This is a high-level for <em>why</em> I migrated from macOS to FreeBSD.</p>
<p>Not so long ago, I was using macOS as my daily driver. The main reason why I got a macbook was the underlying BSD Unix and the nice graphics it provides. Also, I have an iPhone. But they were also the same reasons for why I <strong>left</strong> macOS.</p>
<p>I did not want to write this post right after the migration, I wanted to take my time, use FreeBSD daily, see if I will ever miss macOS.</p>
<p>Here’s a tweet of mine from 8 months ago</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Every 4 months I look at my systems (servers, laptops, desktops, embedded) to see if there's anything suspicious, if anything got hacked, etc.</p><p>man, I did not realize that macOS is that complicated. Why is there a "studentd" running? I don't even use Classrooms :/</p></div>— Antranig Vartanian (@antranigv) <a href="https://twitter.com/antranigv/status/1234753346600394752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>Let’s look at it this way. macOS is becoming less Unix-y every year, <code>date(1)</code> is outdated, there are 100+ Unix processes running by the time the system is booted, most of them are useless for the general user, it has no native package manager (at least MacPorts/homebrew/pkgsrc is out there) and for a power user, there is no proper documentation. Have you ever checked the FreeBSD handbook? Everything is right there!</p>
<p>Okay, the nice graphics part. Have you seen the latest and greatest Big Sur? It feels like eye-candy, it’s not made for power users at all, everything seems to be a distraction now, even the icons. I’m no UI guru, but bringing iOS to the desktop is not for everyone.</p>
<p>So I decided to move to FreeBSD. This is where many people will tell me “Okay but not everything works outside the box”, true! but which OS works outside the box these days anyway? Windows is still a nightmare, setting up macOS took me 3 days the last time, Linux takes way more if you’re building it from scratch. Setting up FreeBSD took me 3 days, however this meant that I will NOT need to change it again for a very, very, VERY long time.</p>
<p>Every time Apple pushed an updated, my <code>pf.conf</code> and <code>automount</code> configs got broken on macOS. They either got deleted or they moved somewhere. Well, the last 2 times it just got deleted.</p>
<p>On FreeBSD, I upgraded from <code>12.1-RELEASE</code> to <code>12.2-RELEASE</code> and nothing broke, and in case there were any changes, FreeBSD just asked me what to do about them.</p>
<p>Let’s come back for a second. Unix is outdated and Apple does not care about it, fancy graphics are too fancy now. Doing forensics is almost impossible. And the hardware is, well, not the best out there (have you ever disassembled a MacBook Pro? it’s takes 2 hours to change a battery while I can reassemble my Dell Latitudes and ThinkPads in 30 minutes).</p>
<p>So there was no reason to stay here anymore. I had to migrate. The question is: where?</p>
<p>Linux has systemd, not my favorite thing out there, Windows is privacy nightmare. That left me with 2 major options: Linuxes without systemd (Gentoo, in my case) or BSDs.</p>
<p>Since I run FreeBSD servers anyway, I just migrated to FreeBSD.</p>
<p>Here’s a short review about running FreeBSD on ThinkPad T480s.</p>
<ul>
<li>WiFi: works. not the fastest, but fast enough.</li>
<li>Graphics: works.</li>
<li>Touchpad: works with multiple fingers AND very configurable via <code>sysctl</code>.</li>
<li>BT does discovery and pairs, I still have to try it with non-Apple headphones.</li>
<li>COVID-19 era: Zoom, Google Hangouts, Jitsi and all other WebRTC-based video conferencing software works via web as well.</li>
<li>Thanks to <a href="https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/linuxulator-how-to-run-google-chrome-linux-binary-on-freebsd.77559/">Linuxulator</a>, I can watch Netflix as well: <a href="https://twitter.com/antranigv/status/1327422687107555329">here’s a screenshot</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, it’s Free and Open Source.</p>
<p>It’s been 1 month and 1 day since I last touched my MacBook Pro, so, what do I miss?</p>
<ul>
<li>Better BT support</li>
<li>Faster WiFi</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it, that’s all missing on a FreeBSD laptop these days. WiFi can do 48Mbps according to <code>ifconfig</code> but I usually get 10-20Mbps. BT pairs with my Apple AirPods but I wish it worked till the end.</p>
<p>Having a nice workstation/laptop is not an easy thing, using macOS means living by Apple rules, Windows is the same for Microsoft. The BSDs gave me the power to be as free as possible :)</p>
<p>During the next weeks I’ll try to blog about the actual setup.</p>
<p>P.S. dear Apple employee, in case you’re reading this, please tell your management to update their BSD Unix layer. Some of us still care, some of us are not just Docker people, some of us are not just “modern” web developers. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>That’s all folks! :)</p>

<p>When 7pace <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/7pace-for-github-announcement">decided to build a time tracking solution for the GitHub universe</a>, our developers thought it should be a somewhat straightforward project. Take the Timetracker we already built for Azure DevOps, and make it work for Github users. No sweat, right?</p>



<p>If you’re a developer, you probably already see where this is going.</p>



<p>Of course it wasn’t that simple.</p>



<p>“The team [working on the GitHub extension] came from that original team,” said 7pace product manager Sascha Zierfuss. “So although we know exactly what we’re doing, we understand how customers are using it and all that — the new product is in a different realm. So a lot of the assumptions and the knowledge that we had no longer applies.”</p>



<p>In other words, features that were simple to build for the <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/azure-devops-best-practices">Azure DevOps Timetracker</a> were a lot more complicated to build for the GitHub Timetracker. And that meant, as the team was making time and effort estimates for different parts of the work, they were off —&nbsp;sometimes <em>way</em> off.</p>



<p>“Now we take a bit more time to dive a bit more deeply and think about it a bit more before coming up with an answer as to how complex or how easy or difficult something is,” Zierfuss explained. “We take a bit more time upfront. But that has made our sprints a lot more successful and helped with the planning as well. If there’s something we think we can achieve in, say, a few months, we’re now better able to assess whether we need some help to reach that goal, if we have to cut a few things, and so on.”</p>



<p>As the developers who are nodding along already know, the 7pace team didn’t have a unique problem. Most, if not all, software teams struggle at some point with scoping work, especially when they’re working on something they’ve never done before. But how can your team accurately scope work when <em>every</em> project is something new?</p>



<p>We don’t have a perfect answer —&nbsp;whoever figures out how to solve this challenge will be a hero to the developer community. But we think some of the lessons our team learned about this can help other developers. We think there’s a secret weapon for scoping that many teams haven’t even considered.</p>



<h2>Step 1: Keep Calm and Code On</h2>



<p>The first thing to keep in mind is that this isn’t a world-ending problem. Yes, we should all be striving to get better at scoping work. But it’s a challenge that literally every software team faces. Don’t believe us? Well, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/delivering-large-scale-it-projects-on-time-on-budget-and-on-value#">one recent study</a> found that two out of every three enterprise software projects have cost and effort overruns.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="668" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/66-with-frame-1024x668.png" alt="66% of enterprise software products have cost and effort overruns" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/66-with-frame-1024x668.png 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/66-with-frame-300x196.png 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/66-with-frame-768x501.png 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/66-with-frame-1536x1003.png 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/66-with-frame.png 1590w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>When it comes to scoping work, a little perspective can often be helpful. Keep in mind that estimates are a part of every step of the development process. We’re not giving you permission to give up on trying to be better at scoping, but we are saying: Don’t panic. Keep the work moving forward, even if it turns out your scoping is all wrong. And in the meantime, use these tips to get better at scoping your work.</p>



<h2>Project Scoping Best Practices</h2>



<p>When trying to scope a project, there are some best practices that can help all teams.</p>



<h3>Remember that Building Software Is an Evolving Process</h3>



<p>They call building software a “process of discovery” for a reason. As you move through any given project, you can <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/learning-is-work">expect it to evolve and change</a>. Requirements aren’t set in stone at the outset of a project, and as you progress through building the software, you may well find that you need to change the requirements along the way to better fit the spirit of what you’re trying to build.</p>



<p>This means that an important best practice is to stay in constant communication — with your team and with your client or organization. Keep every up-to-date on when and how project requirements are changing. This may mean making adjustments to your estimated scope as you go. But over time, your team should get better at making more accurate estimates.</p>



<h3>Mind Parkinson’s Law</h3>



<p>Parkinson’s Law says that work will expand to <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/healthier-work-systems">fill the time allotted for it</a>. That means that by giving yourself and your team deadlines based on your project scope, it’s just as important not to <em>overestimate</em> time and effort as it is not to <em>underestimate</em> them.</p>



<p>We get it. It’s easy to avoid missing deadlines by giving your team padded deadlines to allow for those unforeseen delays that every software team encounters. But this can just as easily result in taking much longer to deliver on a project than you actually need to, and thus getting in the habit of overestimating your scope.</p>



<p>Combat this by keeping sprints short. This means you get constant feedback on progress and new directions for the next sprint, which will help improve the quality of your time and effort estimates.</p>



<h3>Don’t Try to Transfer Estimates</h3>



<p>When scoping work, a very important thing to keep in mind is that time and effort estimates are not transferable between different members of your team. Developers vary wildly in their experience, expertise, work styles, and so many other factors that can affect how long it takes them to do a job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll make better estimates about scope if you do so with everyone’s personal experience and skill level in mind —&nbsp;and even better if every dev on the team is invited to help scope their own work.</p>



<h3>Beware of Context Switching</h3>



<p>Part of the work that developers do is juggling multiple projects, clients, and responsibilities. It’s not often that a developer or a team will be solely dedicated to one project at all times.</p>



<p>While this keeps the job fun and interesting, it comes with a major downside: Frequent switching between tasks and projects can severely interrupt your team’s flow, which can slow down the work and lead to inaccurate scoping.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is another area where doing short sprints can help. That way, your team has predetermined blocks of time for different tasks and projects, and can mentally prepare as needed.</p>



<h2>How to Scope a Project, Step by Step</h2>



<p>Most of these best practices require having <em>some</em> grasp of the time and effort it will take your team to complete a project. But what if you truly don’t know, because the project is something totally new to your team?</p>



<p>Use this framework for collecting information and turning it into a project scope that’s as accurate as possible, even when you’re navigating new territory.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="646" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/how-to-scope-a-software-dev-project-1024x646.png" alt="How to Scope a Software Development Project" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/how-to-scope-a-software-dev-project-1024x646.png 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/how-to-scope-a-software-dev-project-300x189.png 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/how-to-scope-a-software-dev-project-768x484.png 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/how-to-scope-a-software-dev-project-1536x969.png 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/how-to-scope-a-software-dev-project.png 1754w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h3>Step 1: Collect All Crucial Information</h3>



<p>Before even beginning to estimate a project’s scope, you need to collect every piece of information about the project that might be relevant to the scope. This includes:</p>



<ul><li>Project deliverables</li><li>All available resources, including team members, money, and work capacity</li><li>Inclusions and exclusions</li><li>Project constraints</li></ul>



<p>Gather as much detail about each of these as you can, as well as any other project information that might be relevant to the scope.</p>



<h3>Step 2: Build a Project Schedule</h3>



<p>Using all the relevant project information, you can start to sketch a rough schedule for completing the project. In your schedule, start with major tasks and milestones, and once those are laid out, try to break them down further into minor tasks and milestones. For especially long or complex projects, it might help to break up the work into phases, first.</p>



<h3>Step 3: Tailor the Scope to Fit Your Team</h3>



<p>Every team has <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/autonomy-software-teams">different work styles and methodologies</a>. Now’s the time to take your rough project schedule, and adapt it as needed to fit how your team works. This may mean breaking the first phase or milestone into your first sprints. It may mean assigning certain milestones to certain stakeholders to oversee. This will be different for every team.</p>



<h3>Step 4: Compile Your Scope and Review</h3>



<p>Now that you’ve gathered so much project information and turned it into a project scope, it’s time to review it —&nbsp;with other stakeholders, if necessary —&nbsp;and make any adjustments as needed. This is also the time to put the scope in writing and make sure it’s agreed upon by all the major stakeholders in the project. That way, you can refer back to your scope agreement throughout the duration of the work, and treat it as a guide for making changes or decisions. This can also help avoid scope creep, or any changes that will require time or money you don’t have.</p>



<p>The scope agreement may not be perfect, but having it in place can help negotiations go smoother if your estimates do turn out to be wrong, and you need to make scope adjustments as the project moves forward.</p>



<h2>For More Accurate Scoping, You Need Historical Data</h2>



<p>One great way for teams to find a starting point for scoping work (even on projects they’ve never tackled before) is by looking at historical data.</p>



<p>We know that time tracking isn’t the most popular thing among software teams (because <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/timekeeping-is-not-toxix">so many managers use it as a way to micromanage their developers’ time</a>). But we think time tracking can be so much more than that. We think it can be a powerful, if often overlooked, tool that software teams can use to make themselves better.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.7pace.com/timetracker">7pace Timetracker</a> is built by developers, for developers. It’s meant to be a timetracker that runs fully in the background so you don’t even notice it’s there. But all the while, it’s collecting data about the time you and your team spend working, and compiling that data so you can use it to identify your <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/software-development-pace-calculation">pace</a>, <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/what-causes-software-bugs">hurdles</a>, and successes — as an individual dev or as a team. The best part? You can use that data to help scope work —&nbsp;even when it’s work you’ve never done before.</p>



<p>We’re not saying this is a silver bullet. Accurately estimating work scopes, particularly on new types of projects, will probably always be a challenge for developers. But by using the right tools, teams can continue to improve their scoping skills.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Washington, D.C.</em> – The Libra Association announces the adoption of a new name and the recruitment of key executives, reinforcing its organizational independence. Now transitioning to the name “Diem”, which denotes a new day for the project, the Diem Association will continue to pursue a mission of building a safe, secure and compliant payment system that empowers people and businesses around the world.</p>
<p>The Association has been focused on ensuring that the project is designed to meet regulatory expectations, consistent with the Association’s guiding principles of innovation, inclusion, and integrity. “The Diem project will provide a simple platform for fintech innovation to thrive and enable consumers and businesses to conduct instantaneous, low-cost, highly secure transactions,” said Stuart Levey, the Diem Association’s CEO. “We are committed to doing so in a way that promotes financial inclusion – expanding access to those who need it most, and simultaneously protecting the integrity of the financial system by deterring and detecting illicit conduct. We are excited to introduce Diem – a new name that signals the project’s growing maturity and independence.”</p>
<p>As part of the effort to achieve regulatory approval and progress toward launch, Diem has recently attracted a group of world-class professionals to help lead the Association and Diem Networks, the subsidiary that is the regulated payment system operator. This includes the appointment of Dahlia Malkhi as the Association’s Chief Technology Officer, Christy Clark as Chief of Staff, Steve Bunnell as Chief Legal Officer, and Kiran Raj as Executive Vice President for Growth and Innovation and Deputy General Counsel.</p>
<p>Additionally, Diem Networks has recently announced the appointment of James Emmett as Managing Director, Sterling Daines, as Chief Compliance Officer, Ian Jenkins as Chief Financial and Risk Officer, and Saumya Bhavsar as General Counsel. “This is a stellar group of executives and having the Executive Committee of Diem Networks in place alongside existing leaders and colleagues is a critical step for Diem to operate with appropriate autonomy,” said Levey.</p>
<p>With the top team now in place, the Diem Association is prioritizing technological and operational readiness for launch. “The evolution of the project results from constructive ongoing engagement with governments, regulators and other key stakeholders,” said Levey. There is growing consensus around the world on the need to modernize financial infrastructure and regulatory frameworks to meet changing consumer demands and keep pace with global innovation in digital payments. The Association has committed that it will proceed only upon receiving regulatory approval, including a payment systems license for the operational subsidiary of the Association from FINMA. The licensing process is ongoing and the operational subsidiary of the Association is in active and productive dialogue with FINMA.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><h3>“We’re going public!”</h3></p><div><section>
  <p>For a startup employee, learning about your company’s initial public offering (IPO) is an exciting time. But it’s also overwhelming from a financial planning perspective. You have a variety of different equity grants, and you must decide what to do with each one. How many stock options should you exercise and sell, and when? What will your tax obligations be, and how can you minimize them?</p>
  <p>This guide covers what a startup employee needs to know to make well-informed decisions about all of this. We’ll start with tax considerations around exercising and selling stock. Then, we’ll discuss strategies and timelines for selling stock after the IPO. Finally, we’ll go over ways to further minimize your tax burden after selling.
  </p>
</section></div><h3>Taxes</h3><div><section>
<p>Money made from selling stock is taxed either as ordinary income (i.e. <span>federal<label for="sn-federal"></label></span><span>In 2020, the federal tax brackets
        were: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%. Your bracket depends on your income and filing status; more
        details
        <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets">here.</a></span> plus
      <span>state<label for="sn-state"></label></span>
      
      <span>In 2020, California state tax brackets
        <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/california-state-tax#:~:text=California%20state%20tax%20brackets%20are,subject%20to%20California%20state%20tax.">ranged</a>from
        1% to 12.3%. New York state tax brackets
        <a href="https://www.tax-brackets.org/newyorktaxtable">ranged</a> from 4% to 8.82%. Your bracket
        depends on your income and filing status.</span>
      income taxes), or as long-term capital gains. If you acquire a stock (e.g. by exercising an option or vesting an
      RSU) and hold it for over a year before selling it, then your profit is classified as a long-term capital gain.
      Profits from stocks held for less than a year are short-term capital gains, and they’re taxed at the same rate
      as
      ordinary income.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long-term capital gains are taxed at about half the
      <span>ordinary income tax rate<label for="sn-oitr"></label></span>
      
      <span>For unmarried individuals, the long-term capital gains federal tax rate
        <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/capital-gains-tax-rates">is</a>: 0% for income below
        $40k; 15% for income
        between $40k-$441,450; 20% for income exceeding $441,450. In California, though, you’ll have to <a href="https://pocketsense.com/capital-gains-taxes-state-california-8405869.html">pay</a> additional
        state income tax on all capital gains (see footnote 2).</span>
      . So, in general, to minimize your tax
      burden, maximize your long-term capital gains.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let’s look at how this plays out for ISOs, NSOs, and RSUs.
    </p>
</section></div><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f89a88f5a23982843f8d21f/5fb8100b85626a8067b0c690_cg3.png" loading="lazy" width="720" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 92vw, (max-width: 991px) 88vw, 53vw" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f89a88f5a23982843f8d21f/5fb8100b85626a8067b0c690_cg3-p-500.png 500w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f89a88f5a23982843f8d21f/5fb8100b85626a8067b0c690_cg3-p-800.png 800w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f89a88f5a23982843f8d21f/5fb8100b85626a8067b0c690_cg3-p-1080.png 1080w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f89a88f5a23982843f8d21f/5fb8100b85626a8067b0c690_cg3.png 1440w" alt=""></p><h4>Employee Stock Options (ISOs and NSOs)</h4><div><section>    <p>
      Employee stock options represent the right to purchase a certain number of shares of your company at a certain
      price, once the options have vested. There are two types—ISOs and NSOs—and early-stage companies will typically
      issue a mix of both to their employees.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each tranche of options that you’ve been issued, be aware of three key numbers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your strike price (aka exercise price): how much you pay to purchase each share.</li>
      <li>The 409A value (aka fair market value) of the shares, as of the time you exercise the options. For private
        companies, the 409A value is an independent appraisal of how much the private company’s stock is worth. After
        the
        IPO, this value becomes
        <span>the company’s public stock price.<label for="sn-psp"></label></span>
        
        <span>Leading up to the IPO, the fair market value of your shares will likely rise greatly
          towards the company’s preferred price (or at least fluctuate). These fluctuations may greatly impact your tax
          calculations, and your company's finance team should keep you up-to-date on them.</span></li>
      <li>Your sale price: the price at which you later sell the shares.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      On a high level, here is the difference between ISOs and NSOs:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>For NSOs</b>
    </p><ul>
      <li>Pay ordinary income tax on (409A value - exercise price) when you exercise your options. So, if you pay $2 to
        purchase each share and the 409A value is $10, then you’re taxed on the $8 spread.</li>
      <li>Pay
        <span>capital gains tax<label for="sn-cgt"></label></span>
        
        <span>Depending whether you held the shares for over a year before selling them, you’ll either
          pay long-term capital gains or ordinary income tax on them.</span>
        on (sale price - 409A at the time of exercise) when you sell the shares. So, if you exercise the shares when the
        409A value is $10, then sell those shares for $50, then you’ll be taxed on the $40 capital gain.</li>
    </ul>
    

    <p>
      <b>For ISOs</b>
    </p><ul>
      <li>Pay no tax when you exercise—unless you trigger the AMT (details below)</li>
      <li>Pay long-term capital gains tax on (sale price - exercise price) when you sell—if the shares are sold at least
        one year after exercising, and at least two years after your options were granted. Otherwise, (sale price -
        exercise price) will be taxed as short-term capital gains (roughly ordinary income). </li>
    </ul>
    
</section></div><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f89a88f5a23982843f8d21f/5fb7e520ee86f4c5b5ab5c00_nsoiso.png" loading="lazy" width="720" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 92vw, (max-width: 991px) 88vw, 53vw" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f89a88f5a23982843f8d21f/5fb7e520ee86f4c5b5ab5c00_nsoiso-p-500.png 500w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f89a88f5a23982843f8d21f/5fb7e520ee86f4c5b5ab5c00_nsoiso-p-800.png 800w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f89a88f5a23982843f8d21f/5fb7e520ee86f4c5b5ab5c00_nsoiso-p-1080.png 1080w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f89a88f5a23982843f8d21f/5fb7e520ee86f4c5b5ab5c00_nsoiso.png 1440w" alt=""></p><h4>Alternative Minimum Tax for ISOs<br></h4><div><section> 
<p>
      Upon exercising your ISOs, you will likely qualify for the Alternative Minimum Tax, or
      <span>AMT.<label for="sn-amt"></label></span>
      
      <span>Back in 1969, 155 individuals with incomes over $200,000 managed to pay zero federal income
        taxes, triggering popular outrage. The AMT was introduced to prevent this from happening again.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The AMT is calculated based on the bargain element: the (409A value - exercise price). You owe AMT if:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Your total bargain value ( [409A value - exercise price] * total ISOs exercised ) exceeds the AMT exemption
        amount (which
        was
        <span>$72,900 for unmarried individuals<label for="sn-amt"></label></span>
        
        <span>For married couples filing jointly, the 2020 AMT exemption amount was $113,400.</span>
        in 2020).

      </li>
      <li>
        The tax you owe under the <span>AMT calculation<label for="sn-amtcalc"></label></span>
        
        <span>We won’t discuss how to calculate your exact AMT burden in this article, but it will come
          out to 26-28% of your total bargain value.

        </span>
        exceeds the tax you owe under regular tax calculations.
      </li>
    </ol>
  

    <p>
      You will have to pay AMT when you file your tax return for the year that you exercise your ISOs (it is not
      withheld at the time you exercise), so make sure to plan accordingly.
    </p>
</section></div><h4>AMT Credits<br></h4><div><section> 
<p>
      Upon exercising your ISOs, you pay AMT . Then, when you
      sell those shares, you’re taxed again on your capital gains. To lessen the blow of thus being taxed twice on ISOs,
      Congress introduced AMT credits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose you paid $5000 in AMT in 2019. In any subsequent year where you don't owe AMT (say, 2020), you might be
      able to get back some or all of that $5000. There are a few
      conditions for getting this tax credit:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>You can't owe AMT in 2020.</li>
      <li>The maximum amount of AMT credit you can claim for 2020 is [regular tax bill for 2020 - AMT amount for 2020].
        After you claim your credits for 2020, any of the original $5000 that's left over can be used toward a
        subsequent year's tax deduction.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      There are many other caveats that may warrant speaking with a financial advisor. But the bottom line is: you may
      want to try to strategically maximize the amount of AMT credit that you can claim later. Or, you can limit the
      number of ISOs that you exercise and stay below the AMT exemption amount (thus avoiding the AMT altogether).
    </p>
</section></div><h4>Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)<br></h4><div><section> 
<p>
      RSUs turn into shares of your company’s stock when they vest. They’re typically issued by companies valued at over
      $1 billion.
    </p>
    <p>
      RSUs are subject to either single- or double-trigger vesting. Single-trigger RSUs can vest before IPO. This means
      you’ll owe taxes on them as they vest (because you’re coming into ownership of new shares of stock). However, if
      the company is still private, you won’t be able to sell those shares to make money to pay the taxes you owe on
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s why many companies instead offer double-trigger RSUs, which only vest after the IPO. That way, you’ll only
      owe taxes once the company is public and you can actually sell those shares. So, for the year that your company
      IPOs, be prepared to pay taxes on
      <span>any double-trigger RSUs that you vest.<label for="sn-dtr"></label></span>
      
      <span>Your RSUs may vest either on IPO day or after the lockup period, depending on the
        company.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      When your RSUs vest (whether before or after IPO), you’ll owe ordinary income tax on the
      <span>409A value of your newly issued shares as of that day.<label for="sn-4nid"></label></span>
      
      <span>As a reminder, the 409A value after IPO is equivalent to the company’s public stock
        price.</span>
      Then, when you sell those shares, your profit (i.e. [sale price - 409A value as of the day the shares vested])
      <span>will be taxed as capital gains.<label for="sn-wtcp"></label></span>
      
      <span>Again, these qualify for long-term capital gains tax treatment if you hold onto the shares
        for over a year.</span>
    </p>

      You can actually exempt your stock from all the federal taxes we’ve discussed above, if it counts as qualified
      small business stock (QSBS). Your stock might qualify as QSBS if:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>At the time that your stock was issued (i.e. when you exercised your options), your company’s gross assets did
        not exceed $50 million.</li>
      <li>You’ve held the stock for at least five years before selling it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are a number of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qsbs-qualified-small-business-stock.asp"></a>other caveats. But, if
      you can get QSBS treatment, you’ll almost certainly save a lot of
      money in taxes.
    </p>
</section></div><h3>Selling your stock<br></h3><div><section>
<p>
      With these tax considerations in mind, let’s discuss plans for selling your shares.
    </p>
    <p>The soonest that you can sell your shares is after the lockup period. The lockup period lasts around six months,
      starting from the IPO date, and is meant to prevent employees from flooding the market with their shares
      <span>(and thus lowering the stock price).<label for="sn-lup"></label></span>
      
      <span>This is generally true for traditional IPOs. If your company is going public via a direct
        listing, there might not be a lockup period.</span>
      After the lockup period, employees generally employ one of a few selling strategies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sell most of their equity immediately.</li>
      <li>Sell most of their shares as soon as they qualify for long-term capital gains tax treatment.</li>
      <li>Plan to sell a constant number …</li></ul></section></div></div></div>

        once in Chicago with the <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/">SPLASH</a> conference.
        Due to outside forces, there will be a single virtual event.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Rebase</strong> will use the Clowdr platform for interaction,
        registration allows attendees to ask questions and meet with each other
        and with speaker. Registration also give access to all of the

<h2><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></h2>



<p>In the publication entitled “Detection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real-time RT-PCR” (Eurosurveillance 25(8) 2020) the authors present a diagnostic workflow and RT-qPCR protocol for detection and diagnostics of 2019-nCoV (now known as SARS-CoV-2), which they claim to be validated, as well as being a robust diagnostic methodology for use in public-health laboratory settings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In light of all the consequences resulting from this very publication for societies worldwide, a group of independent researchers performed a point-by-point review of the aforesaid publication in which 1) all components of the presented test design were cross checked, 2) the RT-qPCR protocol-recommendations were assessed w.r.t. good laboratory practice, and 3) parameters examined against relevant scientific literature covering the field.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>The published RT-qPCR protocol for detection and diagnostics of 2019-nCoV and the manuscript suffer from numerous technical and scientific errors, including insufficient primer design, a problematic and insufficient RT-qPCR protocol, and the absence of an accurate test validation. Neither the presented test nor the manuscript itself fulfils the requirements for an acceptable scientific publication. Further, serious conflicts of interest of the authors are not mentioned. Finally, the very short timescale between submission and acceptance of the publication (24 hours) signifies that a systematic peer review process was either not performed here, or of problematic poor quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;We provide compelling evidence of several scientific inadequacies, errors and flaws. </p><p>Considering the scientific and methodological blemishes presented here, we are confident that the editorial board of Eurosurveillance has no other choice but to retract the publication.</p></div>







<h2><strong>CONCISE REVIEW REPORT</strong></h2>



<div><p>This paper will show numerous serious flaws in the Corman-Drosten paper, the significance of which has led to worldwide misdiagnosis of infections attributed to SARS-CoV-2 and associated with the disease COVID-19. We are confronted with stringent lockdowns which have destroyed many people’s lives and livelihoods, limited access to education and these imposed restrictions by governments around the world are a direct attack on people’s basic rights and their personal freedoms, resulting in collateral damage for entire economies on a global scale.</p><p><strong>There are ten fatal problems with the Corman-Drosten paper which we will outline and explain in greater detail in the following sections.</strong></p></div>



<p>The first and major issue is that the novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (in the publication named 2019-nCoV and in February 2020 named SARS-CoV-2 by an international consortium of virus experts) is based on in silico (theoretical) sequences, supplied by a laboratory in China [1], because at the time neither control material of infectious (“live”) or inactivated SARS-CoV-2 nor isolated genomic RNA of the virus was available to the authors. To date no validation has been performed by the authorship based on isolated SARS-CoV-2 viruses or full length RNA thereof. According to Corman et al.:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong><em>“We aimed to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodology for use in public health laboratory settings without having virus material available.”</em> [1]</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>The focus here should be placed upon the two stated aims: a) <em>development</em> and b) <em>deployment of a diagnostic test for use in public health laboratory settings</em>. These aims are not achievable without having any actual virus material available (e.g. for determining the infectious viral load). In any case, only a protocol with maximal accuracy can be the mandatory and primary goal in any scenario-outcome of this magnitude. Critical viral load determination is mandatory information, and it is in Christian Drosten’s group responsibility to perform these experiments and provide the crucial data.</p>



<div><p>Nevertheless these in silico sequences were used to develop a RT-PCR test methodology to identify the aforesaid virus. This model was based on the assumption that the novel virus is very similar to SARS-CoV from 2003 as both are beta-coronaviruses.</p><p>The PCR test was therefore designed using the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV as a control material for the Sarbeco component; we know this from our personal email-communication with [2] one of the co-authors of the Corman-Drosten paper. This method to model SARS-CoV-2 was described in the Corman-Drosten paper as follows:</p></div>



<blockquote><p><em>“<strong>the establishment and validation of a diagnostic workflow for 2019-nCoV</strong> <strong>screening and specific confirmation, designed in absence of available virus isolates or original patient specimens. Design and validation were enabled by the close genetic relatedness to the 2003 SARS-CoV, and aided by the use of synthetic nucleic acid technology.”</strong></em></p></blockquote>



<p>The Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is an important biomolecular technology to rapidly detect rare RNA fragments, which are known in advance. In the first step, RNA molecules present in the sample are reverse transcribed to yield cDNA. The cDNA is then amplified in the polymerase chain reaction using a specific primer pair and a thermostable DNA polymerase enzyme. The technology is highly sensitive and its detection limit is theoretically 1 molecule of cDNA. The specificity of the PCR is highly influenced by biomolecular design errors.</p>



<h3><strong>What is important when designing an RT-PCR Test and the quantitative RT-qPCR test described in the Corman-Drosten publication?</strong></h3>



<h5><strong>1. The primers and probes:</strong></h5>



<p>a) the concentration of primers and probes must be of optimal range <br>(100-200 nM)<br>b) must be specific to the target-gene you want to amplify<br>c) must have an optimal percentage of GC content relative to the total nitrogenous bases (minimum 40%, maximum 60%)<br>d) for virus diagnostics at least 3 primer pairs must detect 3 viral genes (preferably as far apart as possible in the viral genome)</p>



<h5><strong>2. The temperature at which all reactions take place:</strong></h5>



<p>a) DNA melting temperature (&gt;92°)<br>b) DNA amplification temperature (TaqPol specific)<br>c) Tm; the annealing temperature (the temperature at which the primers and probes reach the target binding/detachment, not to exceed 2 ̊C per primer pair). Tm heavily depends on GC content of the primers</p>



<h5><strong>3. The number of amplification cycles (less than 35; preferably 25-30 cycles);</strong></h5>



<p>In case of virus detection, &gt;35 cycles only detects signals which do not correlate with infectious virus as determined by isolation in cell culture [reviewed in 2]; if someone is tested by PCR as positive when a threshold of 35 cycles or higher is used (as is the case in most laboratories in Europe &amp; the US), the probability that said person is actually infected is less than 3%, the probability that said result is a false positive is 97% [reviewed in 3]</p>



<h5><strong>4. Molecular biological validations; amplified PCR products must be validated either by running the products in a gel with a DNA ruler, or by direct DNA sequencing</strong></h5>



<h5><strong>5. Positive and negative controls should be specified to confirm/refute specific virus detection</strong></h5>



<h5><strong>6. There should be a Standard Operational Procedure (SOP) available</strong></h5>



<p>SOP unequivocally specifies the above parameters, so that all laboratories are able to set up the exact same test conditions. To have a validated universal SOP is essential, because it enables the comparison of data within and between countries.</p>



<h3><strong>MINOR CONCERNS WITH THE CORMAN-DROSTEN PAPER</strong></h3>



<p>1. In Table 1 of the Corman-Drosten paper, different abbreviations are stated – “nM” is specified, “nm” isn’t. Further in regards to correct nomenclature, nm means “nanometer” therefore nm should read nM here.</p>



<p>2. It is the general consensus to write genetic sequences always in the 5’-3’ direction, including the reverse primers. It is highly unusual to do alignment with reverse complementary writing of the primer sequence as the authors did in figure 2 of the Corman-Drosten paper. Here, in addition, a wobble base is marked as “y” without description of the bases the Y stands for.</p>



<p>3. Two misleading pitfalls in the Corman-Drosten paper are that their Table 1 does not include Tm-values (annealing-temperature values), neither does it show GC-values (number of G and C in the sequences as %-value of total bases).</p>



<h3><strong>MAJOR CONCERNS WITH THE CORMAN-DROSTEN PAPER</strong></h3>



<h4>A) BACKGROUND</h4>



<div><p>The authors introduce the background for their scientific work as: “The ongoing outbreak of the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) poses a challenge for public health laboratories as virus isolates are unavailable while there is growing evidence that the outbreak is more widespread than initially thought, and international spread through travelers does already occur”.</p><p>According to BBC News [4] and Google Statistics [5] there were 6 deaths world-wide on January 21st 2020 – the day when the manuscript was submitted. Why did the authors assume a challenge for public health laboratories while there was no substantial …</p></div></article></div>

December 1, 2020 | https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2020/topology_graphs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2020/topology_graphs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>I have written at lengths about certain aspects of topological data
analysis, but I have neglected to discuss one of its main applications,
i.e. the classification of graphs. In this post, I will therefore take
you on a quick tour of our ICML paper <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/rieck19a/rieck19a.pdf">A Persistent Weisfeiler–Lehman Procedure for Graph Classification</a>.</p>
<p>Let us assume that we are given a graph with node label information. The
graph could, for instance, be a molecule, whose nodes are atoms such as
carbon or oxygen, and whose edges indicate chemical bonds. The goal
could now be to classify a given molecule into a set of classes, such as
‘toxic’, ‘carcinogen’, etc. How can we achieve such a classification?
One of the simplest techniques dates back to the 1960s and involves
calculating an <em>iterative fingerprint</em> of the graph! This procedure was
suggested by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Weisfeiler">Boris Weisfeiler</a>
and Andrei Lehman&nbsp;(sometimes also transliterated as ‘Leman’) in
their seminal article <a href="https://www.iti.zcu.cz/wl2018/pdf/wl_paper_translation.pdf">The reduction of a graph to canonical form and the
algebra which appears therein</a>.</p>
<p>At its core, the algorithm is an iteration scheme that works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>For a node $v$, collect its label and the labels of adjacent nodes in
a multiset.</li>
<li>Assign this multiset a new label by hashing it—with the proviso
that the hashing function is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function"><em>perfect</em></a>, i.e.
it maps distinct labels to distinct values with no collisions.</li>
<li>Replace all node labels by their multiset hashes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Intuitively, each step of the algorithm accumulates more information
from nodes that are further removed from the current node. The hashed
multiset label is thus an expression of the neighbourhood around
a node—and after a sufficiently large number of iterations, the
hashed labels will not change any more.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you are dealing with this simple graph&nbsp;(to
prevent confusion of node labels and node IDs, I used <em>colours</em> to
indicate node labels in this example):</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/weisfeiler_lehman_graph.svg" alt="Weisfeiler--Lehman example graph" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>Tabulating the neighbourhood of each node then results in the following
table:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/weisfeiler_lehman_table_1.svg" alt="Weisfeiler--Lehman multiset example (before hashing)" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>Now for the hashing step. In this example, <em>perfect hashing</em> means
choosing a set of colours that is distinct for every distinct
combination of neighbourhood labels and vertex labels:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/weisfeiler_lehman_table_2.svg" alt="Weisfeiler--Lehman multiset example (after hashing)" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>Notice how nodes A, B, and G are hashed to the same colour—because
in the first iteration of the algorithm, they cannot be distinguished.
How can we use the information about the hashed labels in a subsequent
comparison task? The answer is lies in <em>counting</em> them in a histogram
vector, which is indexed by the unique labels—this is where our
requirement of the perfect hashing function is helpful. For the
previously-shown graph, it looks like this:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/weisfeiler_lehman_feature_vector.svg" alt="Weisfeiler--Lehman subtree feature vector" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>The <em>fingerprint</em> of this graph, according to the first iteration of the
Weisfeiler–Lehman scheme is therefore $(3, 1, 2, 1)$. Further iterations
just make the feature vector longer&nbsp;(technically, the initial
labels already give rise to a feature vector of counts). This procedure
can now be repeated for higher-order iterations and the resulting
feature vectors can be compared across graphs by evaluating, for
example, their dot product. More formalisations of this idea have
resulted in the very successful <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume12/shervashidze11a/shervashidze11a.pdf">Weisfeiler–Lehman Graph
Kernels</a>
publication. This method arguably constitutes the basis for graph neural
networks—in fact, these networks can be seen as a parametrised
version of the Weisfeiler–Lehman iteration scheme. But I digress—if
you are interested in these aspects, please read <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/beyond-weisfeiler-lehman-approximate-isomorphisms-and-metric-embeddings-f7b816b75751">Michael Bronstein’s
article on going beyond graph
isomorphism</a>
for more details.</p>
<p>Now, despite its great practical utility, this feature vector is lacking
some <em>structural</em> information about the graph. It does not know whether
a certain label contributes much to the topological structure of
a graph—such as a ring of carbon atoms would in molecule—or not. To
this end, we introduced a notion of topological relevance for each node
label! Briefly put, we first developed a distance metric that would
permit us turn any <em>labelled</em> graph into a <em>weighted</em> graph. We then
calculate a persistence barcode, a topological descriptor of the graph.
This descriptor assesses the relevance of a topological feature created
by some node label. We use the topological relevance of each feature as
an additional <em>weight</em> for the previously-shown feature vector. In
essence, labels that contribute a large amount of topological structure
in a graph are assigned a higher weight than labels that only contribute
a meagre amount!</p>
<p>Here is a graphical depiction of our process:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/p_wl_pipeline.svg" alt="Persistent Weisfeiler--Lehman pipeline" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>If you want to brush up your understanding of the barcode calculation,
head on over to <a href="https://christian.bock.ml/">Christian’s website</a>; he has
an <a href="https://christian.bock.ml/posts/persistent_homology">excellent article on persistent
homology</a>.</p>
<p>The neat thing about our approach is that we can easily integrate
information about <em>cycles</em> into the feature vector—this is
a functionality that the original Weisfeiler–Lehman Graph Kernels
Framework lacks. Moreover, these cycles turn out to be crucial in
improving classification performance—we get an increase of more than
3% in classification accuracy by considering them in some data sets!</p>
<p>If this has whet your appetite, I invite you to <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/rieck19a/rieck19a.pdf">read our
paper</a> or <a href="https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/P-WL">take
a look at the code</a>. If you want
to learn more about graph classification using graph kernels, take
a look at our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03854">recent survey on graph kernels</a>,
which will hopefully be officially announced in time for NeurIPS 2020.
In the best tradition of Fermat, I would very much like to cover the
content of the survey here, but this blog is too small to contain all of
it—maybe for a subsequent post?</p>
<p>Until next time!</p>

            If you want to order a book (or something else), don't buy it from
            Amazon.  Amazon harms its customers, as well as workers,
	    the national treasury, and many others that it affects.
	</p>

        <p>
            Here's a good (though long)

	<p>
	  This page lists
	  <a href="http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/boycotts/boycottamazon/amazonshoppingalternatives.aspx">alternatives
	  to Amazon</a> for buying various kinds of products.  Some of
	  these sites may share some of Amazon's unethical practices.
	  I am pretty sure that any site
	  <a href="https://stallman.org/internet-music.html">selling MP3 files</a> on the
	  internet imposes an EULA — an inexcusable wrong.
	  Streaming sites, too.  And all of them identify the
	  purchaser.  It is better to buy from a store, and pay cash.
	  Or else get a copy through sharing.
	</p>
	<p>
	  For a book, order it directly from the publisher or
          through a local book store.  If you want to use a URL to

	    <p>
	      We should not allow a company to have a share over around
	      10% of any market.  If in a certain field a single dominant

              The Amazon Swindle has a back door that can erase books.  We found
              out about this when Amazon <a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/17/some-e-books-are-more-equal-than-others/">remotely
		erased thousands of copies of 1984</a>.  In response to criticism,
              Amazon promised it would never do this again unless <em>ordered to by
		the state</em>, which I find not very comforting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Amazon did not keep that promise.  In 2012 it <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/10/22/kindle-user-claims-amazon-dele.html">wiped

December 1, 2020 | https://www.stackbuilders.com/news/brewing-a-safer-elixir | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.stackbuilders.com/news/brewing-a-safer-elixir">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> is a dynamic, functional language that works on top of the Erlang Virtual Machine. It aims for reliable, performant and scalable applications.</p>
<p>In this post, we’re going to focus on the following topics related to this language:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Functional programming:</strong> a programming paradigm that allows developers to create code that is short and concise by using features like guards or pattern matching.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic typing</strong>: a characteristic of a programming language that evaluates types at runtime.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re wondering: <em>How is Elixir going to help me to build a reliable and scalable application when it’s a dynamic language? I could have a type error at any moment.</em> Don’t worry, we are going to solve this question. But first, we need to talk about some tools and concepts.</p>
<h2 id="mix">Mix</h2>
<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.html">Mix</a> is Elixir’s build tool that allows us to create projects, manage dependencies, run tasks and even more. Mix can also compile your project’s dependencies and source code with the following commands:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span>mix</span> deps.compile <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>mix</span> compile</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we know how to compile our code, let’s create a small module with only one function:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyModule</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(pet), <span>do</span>: <span>"Hey </span><span>#{</span>pet<span>}</span><span>!"</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a><span>end</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Pretty straightforward, no compile errors and it works as expected. However on a daily basis (and after a few dozen or hundreds of lines of code) there’s always the possibility to make a typo leading our code to runtime errors.</p>
<p>Almost all (<em>if not all</em>) developers with experience in web development have run into a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Not_defined">reference error</a>, usually written as <strong>“yourVariable” is not defined</strong>. This is something common in dynamic languages and of course, there are ways to prevent these errors (<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> instead of Vanilla JavaScript for instance).</p>
<p>Lucky for us, compiling Elixir already helps us to prevent this problem out of the box. Let’s introduce a typo in our previous example:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyModule</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(not_used_variable), <span>do</span>: <span>"Hey </span><span>#{</span>pet<span>}</span><span>!"</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3"></a><span>end</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>When compiling the project again, it would display the following output:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>mix</span> compile</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a><span>Compiling</span> 1 file (.ex)</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a><span>warning</span>: variable <span>"pet"</span> does not exist and is being expanded to <span>"pet()"</span>, please use parentheses to remove the ambiguity or change the variable pet</span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a>  <span>lib</span>/barebones.ex:<span>2</span>: MyModule.hello/1</span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-6"><a href="#cb4-6"></a><span>warning</span>: variable <span>"not_used_variable"</span> is unused (if the variable is not meant to be used, prefix it with an underscore)</span>
<span id="cb4-7"><a href="#cb4-7"></a>  <span>lib</span>/barebones.ex:<span>2</span>: MyModule.hello/1</span>
<span id="cb4-8"><a href="#cb4-8"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-9"><a href="#cb4-9"></a>== <span>Compilation</span> error in file lib/barebones.ex ==</span>
<span id="cb4-10"><a href="#cb4-10"></a><span>**</span> (CompileError) <span>lib</span>/barebones.ex:<span>2</span>: undefined function pet/0</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With these messages, we already can see some benefits from the compiler:</p>
<ul>
<li>It fails compilation when there’s a typo.</li>
<li>Warns us for unused variables thus no dead code. This can be achieved by using the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Tasks.Compile.Elixir.html#module-command-line-options">command line option</a> <code>--warnings-as-errors</code>.</li>
</ul>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span>mix</span> compile --warnings-as-errors</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Or if you would like to enable that by default for a project, you can add that option under <code>elixirc_options</code> in your project’s configuration.</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>defmodule</span> <span>Example</span><span>.</span><span>MixProject</span> <span>do</span></span>

<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><a href="#cb6-4"></a>  <span>def</span> project <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb6-5"><a href="#cb6-5"></a>    [</span>
<span id="cb6-6"><a href="#cb6-6"></a>      <span>app:</span> <span>:example</span>,</span>
<span id="cb6-7"><a href="#cb6-7"></a>      <span>version:</span> <span>"0.1.0"</span>,</span>
<span id="cb6-8"><a href="#cb6-8"></a>      <span>elixir:</span> <span>"~&gt; 1.10"</span>,</span>
<span id="cb6-9"><a href="#cb6-9"></a>      <span>start_permanent:</span> <span>Mix</span><span>.</span>env() <span>==</span> <span>:prod</span>,</span>
<span id="cb6-10"><a href="#cb6-10"></a>      <span>elixirc_options:</span> [<span>warnings_as_errors:</span> <span>true</span>]</span>
<span id="cb6-11"><a href="#cb6-11"></a>    ]</span>
<span id="cb6-12"><a href="#cb6-12"></a>  <span>end</span></span>
<span id="cb6-13"><a href="#cb6-13"></a><span>end</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>By using this option, it will make the compilation fail in case there are any warnings in your code.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-matching-and-guards">Pattern Matching and Guards</h2>
<p>Pattern matching allows us to define patterns to check how data is conformed. Furthermore, when writing functions, you can define different bodies for different patterns and as a result, writing cleaner and more readable code.</p>
<p>In Elixir, you can use pattern matching everywhere, even in function declarations. Let’s update our example with a simple match.</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyModule</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(<span>"dog"</span>), <span>do</span>: <span>"Woof woof!"</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(pet), <span>do</span>: <span>"Hey </span><span>#{</span>pet<span>}</span><span>, we haven't meet before!"</span></span>
<span id="cb7-5"><a href="#cb7-5"></a><span>end</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now our function has two possible execution paths based on the argument it receives. But, this still has a flaw. <em>What would happen if the given argument is not a string?</em> This is better known in languages like <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> as a <a href="http://wiki.haskell.org/Partial_functions">partial function</a> or in other words, a function that doesn’t take into account all of the possible execution paths that an argument may have.</p>
<p>We need to remember that Elixir is a dynamic language, and an argument can have any type during runtime. Since we don’t have type-checking during compilation, we may want to add more complex checks in our function and that’s where <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/guards.html">guards</a> come in place. Let’s add a guard to our example so it will format a message when the <code>greet</code> function receives only strings.</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyModule</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(<span>"dog"</span>), <span>do</span>: <span>"Woof woof!"</span></span>
<span id="cb8-3"><a href="#cb8-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb8-4"><a href="#cb8-4"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(pet) <span>when</span> is_binary(pet), <span>do</span>: <span>"Hey </span><span>#{</span>pet<span>}</span><span>, we haven't meet before!"</span></span>
<span id="cb8-5"><a href="#cb8-5"></a></span>
<span id="cb8-6"><a href="#cb8-6"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(_), <span>do</span>: <span>"Oops! That's not a string"</span></span>
<span id="cb8-7"><a href="#cb8-7"></a><span>end</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>By using the <code>when</code> keyword followed by a boolean expression, we can make sure our function only works when the resulting expression is <code>true</code>. <code>is_binary</code> is a wrapper for Erlang’s function <a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#is_binary-1">is_binary</a> which returns <code>true</code> if the given argument is a string. With both things together, this means the following: <em>only execute this function when the argument is a string</em>.</p>
<p>But that’s not all, if we would like to have a more <em>extensible</em> API, we could also provide specific <em>optional</em> patterns by using <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/keywords-and-maps.html">keywords or maps</a>. Let’s update our example accordingly.</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyModule</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(<span>"dog"</span>), <span>do</span>: <span>"Woof woof!"</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><a href="#cb9-4"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(pet) <span>when</span> is_binary(pet), <span>do</span>: <span>"Hey </span><span>#{</span>pet<span>}</span><span>, we haven't meet before!"</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5"><a href="#cb9-5"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-6"><a href="#cb9-6"></a>  <span>@doc</span> <span>"Match a keyword list which contains `:pet` string element"</span></span>
<span id="cb9-7"><a href="#cb9-7"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(<span>pet:</span> pet) <span>when</span> is_binary(pet), <span>do</span>: greet(pet)</span>
<span id="cb9-8"><a href="#cb9-8"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-9"><a href="#cb9-9"></a>  <span>@doc</span> <span>"Match a map which the `:pet` key"</span></span>
<span id="cb9-10"><a href="#cb9-10"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(%{<span>pet:</span> pet}) <span>when</span> is_binary(pet), <span>do</span>: greet(pet)</span>
<span id="cb9-11"><a href="#cb9-11"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-12"><a href="#cb9-12"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(_), <span>do</span>: <span>"Oops! That's not a string"</span></span>
<span id="cb9-13"><a href="#cb9-13"></a><span>end</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>With this, our <code>greet</code> function will work properly for any given string in different data-types and it also has a fallback message in case the given argument is not valid. And <em>voilá</em>! We now have a <em>total function</em> that covers all paths and would lead to no runtime errors!</p>
<h2 id="structs">Structs</h2>
<p>Now that we have used pattern matching and guards, we probably would like to add extra safety to our function. We can do so by using Elixir’s <code>structs</code>. But first of all, let’s understand what they are, as stated from their <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/structs.html">site</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Structs are extensions built on top of maps that provide compile-time checks and default values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just what we were looking for, more <em>compile-time checks</em>! Let’s add a simple <code>Pet</code> struct to our example.</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1"></a><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyModule</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2"></a>  <span>defmodule</span> <span>Pet</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb10-3"><a href="#cb10-3"></a>    <span>defstruct</span> [<span>:kind</span>]</span>
<span id="cb10-4"><a href="#cb10-4"></a>  <span>end</span></span>
<span id="cb10-5"><a href="#cb10-5"></a></span>
<span id="cb10-6"><a href="#cb10-6"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(<span>"dog"</span>), <span>do</span>: <span>"Woof woof!"</span></span>
<span id="cb10-7"><a href="#cb10-7"></a></span>
<span id="cb10-8"><a href="#cb10-8"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(pet) <span>when</span> is_binary(pet), <span>do</span>: <span>"Hey </span><span>#{</span>pet<span>}</span><span>, we haven't meet before!"</span></span>
<span id="cb10-9"><a href="#cb10-9"></a></span>
<span id="cb10-10"><a href="#cb10-10"></a>  <span>@doc</span> <span>"Match a keyword list which contains `:pet` string element"</span></span>
<span id="cb10-11"><a href="#cb10-11"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(<span>pet:</span> pet) <span>when</span> is_binary(pet), <span>do</span>: greet(pet)</span>
<span id="cb10-12"><a href="#cb10-12"></a></span>
<span id="cb10-13"><a href="#cb10-13"></a>  <span>@doc</span> <span>"Match a map which the `:pet` key"</span></span>
<span id="cb10-14"><a href="#cb10-14"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(%{<span>pet:</span> pet}) <span>when</span> is_binary(pet), <span>do</span>: greet(pet)</span>
<span id="cb10-15"><a href="#cb10-15"></a></span>
<span id="cb10-16"><a href="#cb10-16"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(%<span>Pet</span>{<span>origin:</span> kind}) <span>when</span> is_binary(kind), <span>do</span>: greet(kind)</span>
<span id="cb10-17"><a href="#cb10-17"></a></span>
<span id="cb10-18"><a href="#cb10-18"></a>  <span>def</span> greet(_), <span>do</span>: <span>"Oops! That's not a string"</span></span>
<span id="cb10-19"><a href="#cb10-19"></a><span>end</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>By doing those changes in our example and after compiling it, the following messages would be displayed in our console:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1"></a><span>Compiling</span> 1 file (.ex)</span>
<span id="cb11-2"><a href="#cb11-2"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-3"><a href="#cb11-3"></a>== <span>Compilation</span> error in file lib/barebones.ex ==</span>
<span id="cb11-4"><a href="#cb11-4"></a><span>**</span> (CompileError) <span>lib</span>/barebones.ex:<span>14</span>: unknown key :origin for struct MyModule.Pet</span>
<span id="cb11-5"><a href="#cb11-5"></a>    <span>lib</span>/barebones.ex:<span>14</span>: (module)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The compilation error message is really helpful. It says that we have a typo in our code while doing pattern matching in the <code>Pet</code> struct. It will work properly after renaming <code>origin</code> to <code>kind</code>.</p>
<p>Now that we have a deeper understanding of <em>pattern matching</em>, <em>guards</em> and <em>structs</em>, we have a better idea of how to prevent runtime errors in Elixir and also how to receive proper compile-time checks.</p>
<p>Pattern matching structs allows you to be more <em>expressive</em> on our <em>business objects</em> in any project. A great example of this would be the database DSL <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.html">Ecto</a>. Under the hood, it creates structs over your database entities and that makes it easier to perform pattern matching against them.</p>
<h2 id="minor-caveats">Minor caveats</h2>
<p>Using structs in your codebase will help you get better compile-time checks, but, as always there’s a drawback. Each time we use a <code>struct</code> for pattern matching we create a <em>dependency</em> in our module thus leading to greater compilation times.</p>
<p>This is not bad on its own but it could <em>possibly</em> affect a developer’s programming cycle. Taking more time to compile then to execute code after making changes is a frequent task and in big projects, it could even take up to a few minutes to compile everything again (in the worst case scenario).</p>

<p>By using Elixir’s core features we will be able to introduce more <em>safety</em> to our code. But it’s not only about knowing and using its core features. It also means we need to change our mindset.</p>
<p>Having a technical background is the first step towards a <a href="https://tech.ebayinc.com/engineering/functional-thinking/">functional mindset</a>. After that we need to apply those concepts on a daily basis to make using them a habit, allowing us to understand their benefits like making our code declarative, re-usable and <a href="https://dev.to/anssip/why-you-should-learn-functional-programming-3h2g">more</a>. But it doesn’t mean we only have to limit ourselves with this mindset for Elixir. We can also apply these concepts to any other programming language.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1606822927366/_cio4Ua4x.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>We preferred to think that String in JavaScript is an array of characters.</p>
<pre><code>const <span>name</span> = ‘Nick’

console.log(<span>name</span>.length) // <span>4</span>
</code></pre><p>Variable <code>name</code> has 4 characters ‘N’, ‘i’, ‘c’, ‘k’ and length is also 4.</p>
<p>Everything seems logical.</p>
<p>Let’s go further and add emoji to my name.</p>
<pre><code>const <span>name</span> = ‘Nick 🐃’

console.log(<span>name</span>.length) // <span>7</span>
</code></pre><p>Hmm, strange.</p>
<p>Variable <code>name</code> must have 6 characters ‘N’, ‘i’, ‘c’, ‘k’, ‘ ‘ (whitespace) and ‘🐃’</p>
<p>But have 7.</p>
<p>It seems like the bull has 2 characters.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> emoji = ‘🐃’

console.<span>log</span>(emoji.length) 
</code></pre><p>Interesting 🤔</p>
<p>Let’s figure out why.</p>
<p>We go to <a target="_blank" href="https://tc39.es/ecma262">the official documentation</a> of ECMAScript (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript">it’s a programming language on which JavaScript is based</a>).</p>
<p>Scroll to <a target="_blank" href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-ecmascript-language-types-string-type">“6.1.4 The String Type</a>.”</p>
<p>And find this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The String type is the set of all ordered sequences of zero or more 16-bit unsigned integer values (“elements”) up to a maximum length of 2⁵³ - 1 elements. The String type is generally used to represent textual data in a running ECMAScript program, in which case each element in the <strong>String is treated as a UTF-16 code unit value</strong>.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So string in JavaScript is a sequence of UTF-16 code unit values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>❓What is UTF-16?</em></p>
<p><em>💬 A Unicode transformation format (UTF) is an algorithmic mapping from every Unicode code point to a unique byte sequence.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One UTF-16 code unit value is a number from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>❓What is 0x0000 and 0xFFFF?</em></p>
<p><em>💬  <strong>0x</strong> represent <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">the hexadecimal numeral system</a>, often shortened to "hex", is a numeral system made up of 16 symbols (base 16). The standard numeral system is called decimal (base 10) and uses ten symbols: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Hexadecimal uses the decimal numbers and six extra symbols.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we convert my name Nick to UTF-16 (like JavaScript see it) we will get 0x004e 0x0069 0x0063 0x006b.</p>
<p>0x004e = N</p>
<p>0x0069 = i</p>
<p>0x0063 = c</p>
<p>0x006b = k</p>
<p>But how does JavaScript treat emojis?</p>
<p>In UTF-16, Unicode characters from the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_%28Unicode%29">Basic Multilingual Plane</a> (contains characters for almost all modern languages) are encoded with one code unit. </p>
<p>Other characters from the non-Basic Multilingual Plane (emojis, musical notations, cards, hieroglyphs, etc) require two code units.</p>
<p>So UTF-16 format represents 🐃 emoji with two code units (0Xd83d 0Xdc03).</p>
<p>That’s why <code>‘🐃’.length</code> gives 2.</p>
<p>To consolidate everything we have learned, let’s play a little with Unicode and JavaScript.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> name = ‘Nick’

<span>const</span> nameInUnicode = ‘\u<span>004</span>e\u<span>0069</span>\u<span>0063</span>\u<span>006</span>b’

<span>console</span>.log(name === nameInUnicode) // true

<span>console</span>.log(nameInUnicode.length) // <span>4</span>

<span>const</span> fullName = ‘Nick 🐃’

<span>const</span> fullNameInUnicode = ‘\u<span>004</span>e\u<span>0069</span>\u<span>0063</span>\u<span>006</span>b\u<span>0020</span>\ud<span>83</span>d\udc<span>03</span>’

<span>console</span>.log(fullName === fullNameInUnicode) // true

<span>console</span>.log(fullNameInUnicode.length) // <span>7</span>
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p><em>❓ What is \u?</em></p>
<p><em>💬 A Unicode character escape sequence represents the single Unicode code point formed by the hexadecimal number following the “\u” or “\U” characters.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="in-the-end">In the end</h2>
<p>Knowing that string in JavaScript is a sequence of UTF-16 code unit values can save you from unpredictable bugs when you work with different characters not from BMP, like emojis.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We propose a neural talking-head video synthesis model and demonstrate its application to video conferencing. Our model learns to synthesize a talking-head video using a source image containing the target person's appearance and a driving video that dictates the motion in the output. Our motion is encoded based on a novel keypoint representation, where the identity-specific and motion-related information is decomposed unsupervisedly. Extensive experimental validation shows that our model outperforms competing methods on benchmark datasets. Moreover, our compact keypoint representation enables a video conferencing system that achieves the same visual quality as the commercial H.264 standard while only using one-tenth of the bandwidth. Besides, we show our keypoint representation allows the user to rotate the head during synthesis, which is useful for simulating a face-to-face video conferencing experience.</p>

        <p>Link preview provided as a feature by webmail/clients such as Outlook or IM like Telegram may cause unexpected behavior like unwanted account register confirming, automatic mailing list subscribing or even infinite password resetting through links with special functionality.</p>
<h2 id="Official-Account-Used-For-Registering"><a href="#Official-Account-Used-For-Registering" title="Official Account Used For Registering"></a>Official Account Used For Registering</h2><p>One morning, I opened OUR mailbox, and found an address validation letter with a confirming link lying there. Spam, I thought, as this email address is used as a official account, no one in our organizaiton would use it for personal account registration, but right before I close this mailbox, I was suddenly reminded of something.</p>
<p>The day before this morning, we happily tested a new functionality provided by the webmail of Outlook – Link Preview. Well since we are already modern now, with modern front-end and modern webpage, what’s wrong with link preview? This is what we all expected! This is how modern front-end should be like!</p>
<p>But wait, would link preview visit every link in this email? If it does, right after I opened this email, the validation would be done!</p>
<p>Even worse, I cannot check whether the validation is over since the registered account is not in my hand and I dare not click on that confirming link.</p>
<p>After some discussion within our org, we think that there may be some allow lists that prevent the preview of certain sites, but if the list is not a list of REGEX, when I register the account of popular platforms, the link would still be previewed.</p>
<p>So the registered account still hangs there, we do not know its status, and bad thing can be done with that account.</p>
<h2 id="Other-Stories"><a href="#Other-Stories" title="Other Stories"></a>Other Stories</h2><p>After I discovered this issue, I come to a broader concern on similar issues. And after posting this issue among my friends, more stories are collected and more exploits can be done.</p>
<p>One story is that one user of Telegram <em>gmailbot</em> received a validation letter one day, and after they opened that bot, the message of confirmation success was received right away. The mechanism of preview of Telegram is to preview every first link of one message unless the user cancels that.</p>
<p>Another story is that one user of one email provider used that email for some account registering, and one day they forgot their password. For that site, password reset are done by a special link sent to the email address associated with that account, but for the sake of security, the email provider checks every link in the email(common behavior of big providers, maybe), hence the password reset link would have been accessed once when the user sees the email, and the reset cannot be done successfully. Since this security check is a black box and unrevealed to that user, the user tried almost infinitely and asked the admin of that site to debug.</p>
<ol>
<li>When subscribing a mailing list on web, a confirmation letter would be sent, in some forms it asks you to reply to that email containing certain string, but mostly it shows you a validation link. This may be used for spamming hence DoS of one account; it can also be used for DoS of one mailing list as all subscribers are ‘valid’.</li>
<li>When you upload a PGP public key to a keyserver like OpenPGP, it sends validation letter. Hence fake public key of one identity can be made with confirmation, and without revocation.</li>
<li>As the last story above indicates, password reset can never be done, or done by the provider.</li>
<li>When there are one-time special functional links(common behavior), and the provider/client automatically access that link in any form, there are unexpected behaviors. </li>
</ol>

<p>It talks about information leaking and malicious payload, while I am from the perspective of the protocol itself.</p>
<p>Providers, don’t touch my thing.</p>
<p>Automation/Rules without turn-off options are bad. </p>

<p>
	I used to take voice lessons from a great teacher named <a href="http://www.warrensenders.com/">Warren Senders</a>.
</p><p>
	For each lesson, I’d bring in one song I was trying to improve.
</p><p>
	First, I’d sing it for him as written.
</p><p>
	Then he’d say, “OK — <strong>now do it up an octave</strong>.”
</p><p>
	“Uh... up an octave? But I can’t sing that high!”
</p><p>
	“I don’t care! Do it anyway! Go! 1.. 2.. 3.. 4..”
</p><p>
	I’d sing the whole song again, in screeching squeaking falsetto, sounding like a choking mouse.
	But by the second half of the song, it was almost charming.
</p><p>
	Then he’d say, “OK — <strong>now do it down an octave</strong>.”
</p><p>
	“Down an octave?  But I don’t think I can!”
</p><p>
	“Doesn’t matter! Go! 1.. 2.. 3.. 4..”
</p><p>
	I sounded like a garbage disposal or lawn mower, but he made me sing the whole song that way.
</p><p>
	Then he’d make me sing it twice as fast.
	Then twice as slow.
	Then like Bob Dylan.
	Then like Tom Waits.
	Then he’d tell me to sing it like it’s 4 a.m. and a friend woke me up.
	Then he’d give me many other scenarios.
</p><p>
	After all of this, he’d say, “Now… how did that song go again?”
</p><p>
	It was the clearest proof that what I thought was “the” way the song went was really just one of an infinite number of options.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	I’m taking an entrepreneurship class now.
	I’ve never studied business before.
</p><p>
	We analyzed a business plan for a mail-order pantyhose company.
	Like all business plans, it proposed only one plan.
</p><p>
	After reading the whole thing, I felt like saying things my old voice teacher would have said:
</p><ul>
<li>
	“OK — <strong>make a plan that only requires $1000.</strong> Go!”
</li><li>
	“Now <strong>make a plan for 10-times as many customers</strong>. Go!”
</li><li>
	“Now <strong>do it without a website</strong>. Go!”
</li><li>
	“Now <strong>make all your initial assumptions wrong, and have it work anyway</strong>. Go!”
</li><li>
	“Now <strong>show how you would franchise it</strong>. Go!”
</li></ul>
<p>
	You can’t pretend there’s only one way to do it.
	Your first idea is just one of many options.
	No business goes as planned, so make ten radically different plans.
</p><p>
	Realizing <strong>the initial choice you made was just one of many</strong> brings all kinds of weathered wisdom and insight into your business.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	Same thing with your current path in life:
</p>
<ul><li>
	Now you’re living in New York City, obsessed with success. Go!
</li><li>
	Now you’re a free spirit, backpacking around Thailand. Go!
</li><li>
	Now you’re a confident extrovert and everyone loves you. Go!
</li><li>
	Now you’re married and your kids are your life. Go!
</li><li>
	Now you spend a few years in relative seclusion, reading and walking. Go!
</li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605889737391/MgHemT-bu.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>A web application often needs a central counter. We have several simple use-cases like the member id for a registration application. Or the amount collected on a sales application - there are many that we all have seen. We have to make sure the concurrent updates do not clash, and the no data is lost in the process. This problem increases further when our application scales larger on the cloud - with millions of concurrent users.</p>
<p>It is best to avoid such a use case - in large scale applications. It is always advisable that we use a design that does not need an atomic counter - for example using UUID instead of an increasing number. But there are times where we just need the counter. When I found myself in such a situation, here is a solution that I used. It is based on API Gateway - Dynamo DB integration. It has a very good response time and minimal cost.</p>

<p>We all know what is DynamoDB. For those who don't, it is the wonderful serverless NoSQL database provided by AWS. It scales seamlessly to huge volumes and throughput - maintaining extremely fast operations with latency in single digit milliseconds. It is the ideal database for anyone - startup, or enterprise. DynamoDB ensures eventual consistency for all updates. But there is a way to get atomic updates as well.</p>
<p>Going by the One App - One Table philosophy, create a new Item in the table. You can choose the "primaryKey" field as per your data design.</p>
<pre><code>{
   <span>primaryKey</span>: <span>"atomicCounter"</span>,
   <span>counterValue</span>: <span>0</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>So we have a counter that starts with 0. Now, we to configure it to increment atomically and return the number. DynamoDB API provides a method to do it. In order to invoke it, we have to configure the API Gateway</p>

<p>The API Gateway is a versatile service to configure and export API's to the external world. We can use it to invoke Lambda functions, or directly invoke specific AWS Services. We will use the latter to invoke DynamoDB directly.</p>
<p>So we go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.thewiz.net/!https://ap-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/">API Gateway Console</a>, to create a new Rest API - or just a new Resource/Method in your existing application API. Create a new API, and resource and then add a GET method into it. We can use a POST as well. But, GET is more elegant since we only get the counter without providing anything.</p>
<p>Next, we configure the API integration to invoke the DynamoDB.</p>
<h2 id="request-integration">Request Integration</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605884426659/6UiP0SiQ2.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Request Integration.jpg"></p>
<p>Next we provide an integration mapping for the request. We do it here - at the bottom of the Request Integration page.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605880023900/7-otb2WgI.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Request Mapping.jpg"></p>
<pre><code>UpdateItem
{
    <span>"TableName"</span>: <span>"donation-data"</span>,
    <span>"Key"</span>: {
        <span>"context"</span>: {
            <span>"S"</span>: <span>"atomicCounter"</span>
        },
        <span>"id"</span>: {
            <span>"S"</span>: <span>"id"</span>
        }
    },
    <span>"UpdateExpression"</span>: <span>"set counterValue = counterValue + :num"</span>,
    <span>"ExpressionAttributeValues"</span>: {
        <span>":num"</span>: {<span>"N"</span>: <span>"1"</span>}
    },
    <span>"ReturnValues"</span> : <span>"UPDATED_OLD"</span>
}
</code></pre><h2 id="response-integration">Response Integration</h2>
<p>Similarly, we have to map the output on the response. Click on the Response Integration link and add this mapping in there</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605883483314/cStHWxsx7.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Response Integration"></p>
<pre><code>


$value.substring(<span>1</span>,$l)
</code></pre>
<p>We are done with configuring the API. Now click on Deploy API, select a stage and it is ready to test.</p>
<p>Invoke the API from Postman. Everytime you invoke it, you will see the number increasing. </p>
<p>The update operation we used is atomic, so we will always have a unique number from the API.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>This white paper gives an overview of NTS and a detailed description of the authentication process that ensures you receive time information from a trusted source. This includes the step-by-step details of the key establishment and time stamping process. We also provide a summary of the elements that enable NTS to scale and to secure NTP against a range of attack vectors.</p><div><h2>This is a preview of Netnod's NTS white paper. To read&nbsp;the full white paper, see link below.
</h2><p>Introduction
</p><p>Many of the important security tools that keep us safe online depend on accurate time. But until recently there was no way to ensure that the time you received over the Internet was correct. There was simply no way to tell if you were being fed time from a malicious or trusted source.</p>
<p>This is largely because the current standard for receiving time over the Internet, the Network Time Protocol (NTP), was created in 1985. In those more innocent times, the need to secure NTP, the type of security needed, and how to provide it were less understood.</p>
<p>Over the last 35 years, a range of security flaws and some high-profile attacks have shown that NTP needed significantly improved security. The new Network Time Security (NTS) standard has been designed to fix that.</p>
<p><span><strong>NTP security issues&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>Unsecured NTP is vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks where a malicious actor sits between you and the NTP server, listens in on the conversation, forges&nbsp; messages and lies to you about time. As a lot of processes are dependent on accurate time, the consequences here can be very serious and can include:</p>
<ul><li>Incorrect timestamps on logs and transactions which can support fraudulent activities or help disguise other criminal action&nbsp;</li>
<li>Authentication problems, attacks and issues with authentication security measures&nbsp;</li>
<li>Issues with cryptographic signatures and establishing encrypted sessions such as Transport Layer Security (TLS)&nbsp;</li>
<li>DNS Security (DNSSEC) failing to work if the client doesn’t have accurate time</li>
</ul><p><span><strong>Previous attempts at NTP security&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>There have been some previous attempts to add security to NTP. Commonly referred to as NTP-AUTH, these attempts did not provide all necessary aspects of security (confidentiality, authentication and integrity including protection against replay attacks).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, the underlying security mechanism for NTP-AUTH (MD5 or SHA-1) could be considered weak at best. NTP-AUTH is based on secret keys but the key agreement is not standardized. This means that any NTP service provider wanting to use NTP-AUTH has to find their own way to exchange keys with the client out-of-band.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This often requires a potential client to send a letter or fax to get the secret key. The need for a server to store uniquesecret keys for all clients creates scalability problems: as the number of users grows, the storage requirements and especially the ability to rapidly look up a given key makes the service hard to scale.</p>
<p>Given all these issues, it has long been apparent that a new security mechanism for NTP is needed; one based on modern security mechanisms that could also allow the service to scale to potentially millions of clients.</p>
<h2><strong>The NTS standard</strong></h2>
<p>NTS has been developed within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). In March 2015, the first Internet-Draft of the NTS standard was published. Over the next five years, the draft went through 28 further iterations until the Internet Draft ‘Network Time Security for the Network Time Protocol’ was published as a Proposed Standard (RFC8915) in September 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NTS uses modern cryptography to add an important layer of security to NTP. It prevents spoofing and MITM attacks by using authenticated packets. Amplification attacks are prevented by ensuring that request and response packets are always the same size.</p>
<p>NTS is really two protocols: a key establishment protocol, and NTP with some new Extension Fields. The reason for using two protocols is separation of concerns:</p>
<p>1. The seldom used key establishment on top of standard Transport Layer Security (TLS), and</p>
<p>2. The (already existing) low latency UDP-based time synchronisation path.</p>
<p>This means that the existing NTP functionality is the same as before, but the time data can now be authenticated.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>The NTS authentication process</strong></h2>
<p>The authentication process consists of a key establishment and a timestamp request. The key exchange server typically runs on an ordinary computer, but the slim NTS-enabled NTP server is UDP-based and stateless. It can be served from anycast addresses and can be implemented at the hardware level. The NTP server’s state about each client is kept in the cookie provided by the client itself with each request. As there can potentially be hundreds of millions of clients, this is crucial for the smooth operation of a large-scale NTS service.</p>
<p>Since the cryptographic operations in the NTS path are symmetric it is both easier to implement them in hardware and to make them use constant time. This increases the accuracy of the time synchronisation and keeps the slower key exchange outside of the time synchronisation path.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NTS uses Authenticated Encryption using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), more specifically what is known as Synthetic Initialization Vector (RFC 5297). This is a block cipher mode of operation providing nonce-based,&nbsp;misuse-resistant authenticated encryption. Using AES-SIV enables the encryption processes described below to add integrity and origin authentication. The consequences for this at a hardware level will be discussed in an upcoming&nbsp;white paper.</p>
<p><span><strong>The key establishment</strong></span></p>
<p>The key establishment process works as follows: first, a client initiates a key establishment using the NTS-KE protocol embedded in TLS (see figure 1.)</p>

<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> <em>Welcome to JavaScript addition!</em></p>
</section><article><section><p>If you have been working with JavaScript, you have probably seen a lot of usage with the <code>+</code> operator and discovered that the output is not necessarily what you expected.</p>
<p>The language supports using the <code>+</code> operator between (almost) all of the different data types - the results might therefore be confusing. In JavaScript, there is no compiler to hold your hand on your “addition journey”.</p>
<p><strong><em>The addition operator either performs string concatenation or numeric addition.</em></strong></p>
<p>With the rule above you should be able to understand all additions in JavaScript, but some of us need to see examples and explanations to fully understand the different scenarios.</p>
<p>First of all, remember that JavaScript performs the addition from left to right - evaluating parentheses first. This should be familiar with what you have learned in middle-grade mathematics.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>Step<span>-</span>by<span>-</span>step example
<span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>3</span> <span>+</span> <span>4</span><span>)</span>
<span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span> <span>+</span> <span>7</span>
<span>3</span> <span>+</span> <span>7</span>
<span>10</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As the rule states - with two numeric elements, the output is a numeric value:</p>
<p><code>1 + 1 = 2</code></p>
<p>String concatenation is well known between different programming languages and is a  reasonable usage of the <code>+</code> operator:</p>
<p><code>"Santa" + " " + "Claus" = "Santa Claus"</code></p>
<p>So far, so good!</p>
<h2>The most important “rules” with <em>addition</em> in JavaScript</h2>
<ol>
<li>Adding a non-numeric value to a numeric value will try to convert the non-numeric value to a numeric value, if possible. If not, both are converted to strings.</li>
<li>Adding a non-numeric value to some value will convert both values to strings before adding them.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, what does that actually mean?</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"12"</span>
<span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"22"</span>
<span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>"1"</span> <span>+</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"112"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Confused? At least I am…</p>
<p>In the first line, a numeric and non-numeric value is added. Both are converted to strings before they are added</p>
<p><code>"1" + "2" = "12"</code></p>
<p>In the second line, there are both numeric addition and string concatenation. Remember, addition goes from left to right. </p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
<span>2</span> <span>+</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>+</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"22"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The third line only contains string concatenation.</p>
<p><code>"1" + "1" + "2" =&gt; "112"</code></p>
<p>Unfortunately, it doesn’t end here. Some other data types in JavaScript behave in a rather non-typical way when used for addition.</p>
<h2>Boolean</h2>
<p>What happens when you add something with a boolean value?</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>true</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
<span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>false</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>true</span> <span>+</span> <span>true</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
<span>false</span> <span>+</span> <span>false</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>"1"</span> <span>+</span> <span>true</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1true"</span>
<span>"1"</span> <span>+</span> <span>false</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1false"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Boolean values can be converted to numeric values in JavaScript, and the result of the conversion is either 1 or 0.</p>

<p>Combining a boolean and a string value converts <code>true</code> to “true” and <code>false</code> to “false”.</p>
<h2>Objects, arrays and functions</h2>
<p>When one of the values in an addition is an object, array or function it will try to convert it to a primitive value.</p>
<ol>
<li>Execute the <code>valueOf()</code>-function and use that value if it is a primitive</li>
<li>Execute the <code>toString()</code>-function</li>
</ol>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> me <span>=</span> <span>{</span> name<span>:</span> <span>"Charlie"</span><span>,</span> age<span>:</span> <span>34</span> <span>}</span>
me <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>"[object Object]1"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The default <code>valueOf()</code>-implementation is an empty object <code>{}</code> - which is not a primitive and it will try to convert it using <code>toString()</code>. The default <code>toString()</code>-value for an object is <code>"[object Object]"</code> - not very useful for addition. Unfortunately, I have seen this output many times during my time as a developer - it usually happens when I forget to specify the property of the object that should be part of the addition.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it might be handy to override the <code>valueOf()</code> or <code>toString()</code>-function and make it return something useful.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> me <span>=</span> <span>{</span> name<span>:</span> <span>"Charlie"</span><span>,</span> age<span>:</span> <span>34</span> <span>}</span>
me<span>.</span><span>valueOf</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>age <span>}</span>
me <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>35</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The return type is now a numeric value and it will add 34 with 1 - which is 35.</p>
<p>The same can be done for a function or a class - for both <code>valueOf</code> and <code>toString</code>.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>BekkEmployee</span><span>(</span><span>name<span>,</span> age</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>this</span><span>.</span>name <span>=</span> name<span>;</span>
  <span>this</span><span>.</span>age <span>=</span> age<span>;</span>
  <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span><span>this</span><span>.</span>name<span>}</span></span><span> is </span><span><span>${</span><span>this</span><span>.</span>age<span>}</span></span><span> years old</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>new</span> <span>BekkEmployee</span><span>(</span><span>"Charlie"</span><span>,</span> <span>34</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>100</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Charlie is 34 years old100"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For arrays, <code>valueOf</code> returns the array - which is not a primitive value. The output of its <code>toString()</code> is the content joined with a comma. An empty array is the same as an empty string.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>[</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1"</span>
<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>[</span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1,2,3"</span> <span>+</span> <span>"3,4,5"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1,2,34,5,6"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Since you have been reading all along - here is a quiz for you:</p>
<p>PS: try to solve it before you check the browser console</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> me <span>=</span> <span>{</span> name<span>:</span> <span>"Charlie"</span><span>,</span> age<span>:</span> <span>34</span> <span>}</span>
me<span>.</span><span>toString</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>age <span>}</span>

<span>true</span> <span>+</span> me <span>+</span> <span>65</span> <span>+</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>false</span> <span>+</span> me <span>+</span> <span>"merry christmas"</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Date</h2>
<p>All rules have some exceptions...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All native ECMAScript objects except Date objects handle the absence of a hint as if the hint Number were given; Date objects handle the absence of a hint as if the hint String were given.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>Date.valueOf</code> returns a numeric type, but a date will be transformed into a string type when using the <code>+</code> operator.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>2020</span><span>,</span> <span>11</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>12345</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Tue Dec 01 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)12345"</span>
<span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>2020</span><span>,</span> <span>11</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>"12345"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Tue Dec 01 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)12345"</span>

<span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>2020</span><span>,</span> <span>11</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Tue Dec 01 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)"</span>
<span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>2020</span><span>,</span> <span>11</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>valueOf</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>1606777200000</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Weirdos</h2>
<p>Now that you know the important rules of addition, there are some data types you also should be aware of:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>undefined</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>NaN</span> 
<span>undefined</span> <span>+</span> <span>"1"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"undefined1"</span>
<span>null</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span> 
<span>null</span> <span>+</span> <span>"1"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"null1"</span>
<span>NaN</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>NaN</span>
<span>NaN</span> <span>+</span> <span>"1"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"NaN1"</span>
<span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> 
<span>BigInt</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> 
<span>BigInt</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"12"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you have read, addition is not as easy as we know from mathematics. However, if you remember some of the conversion rules above you might save yourself from some headaches in the future!</p></section></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>I’ve been part of the internet startup scene for a while. There are so many different camps: the bootstrappers, the VC-backed tech-bros, the crypto “investors”, the people marketing their courses on marketing courses, the newsletter gurus, the micro-saas homeboys. The list goes on.</p>
<p>Each of these groups have their own, unique views on building companies and products. Some are moonshots, others are sustainable “grow-slowly” types, and each has its own subset of hard-core, flame-war inducing followers. Ah, the internet is a beautiful, terrible, magical, ghastly, colourful place.</p>
<p>I’ve been associated with, and in some cases, been a part of a few of these various subcultures. After working at a VC backed startup, I went the bootstrapped route (popularised by the IndieHackers movement) with my own product. It was an interesting ride, but was still rife with the Marketing Course Joes who just made $3000 last week with their “How to market no-code apps” course, as well as the Hustle Boys with their Twitter feeds full of “Work like no-one works today, so you can live like no-one lives tomorrow. #entrepreneur”. Neither of these resonated with me.</p>
<p>I have found my own analogy/ideology. My product is my garden.</p>
<p>During the early days of lockdown, my girlfriend got deep into gardening. She would spend hours nurturing her tomato plants, weeding, watering, puttering about. She would spend afternoons reading articles on permaculture, figuring out which plants grew well alongside other plants. Lavender with tomatoes kept the pests away, slight shade for the granadilla vine, some water, but not too much for the root vegetables. It was lovely to watch her coax tasty and nutritious food individually out of the ground. I can’t imagine full-scale farming being nearly as enjoyable.</p>
<p>That’s what I want from my products. I want to putter about, feel connected to the process, and have fun doing so. I want to make things that don’t scale. To see people tuck into them and enjoy them as people, not as stats. I’ve done this fairly successfully with <a href="https://justsketch.me/">JustSketchMe</a>. We have a small, diverse, and amazing community of artists and illustrators making awesome things. I’m trying to build a similar product with <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear Blog</a>. Something niche but valuable. Something I can spend time on because I want to.</p>
<p>Being able to talk to, and interact with the people using my tools is fulfilling. Spending time meticulously improving subtle aspects of the product is enjoyable.</p>
<p>Obviously, to do this a product has to reach a basic threshold of profitability. This will differ depending on where you are. I live in Cape Town, South Africa where the cost of living is low (compared to the US and EU). I reached basic profitability, matching an average developer salary here, about 10 months ago, and since then I’ve been improving my projects. Not to grow at all cost, but to ensure that people using the tool have an ever-improving experience.</p>
<p>This is my garden, and I intend to putter.</p>

          <section>
            <article>
              <header>
                                
                
              </header>
              <p>Logs are a handy tool to spot mistakes and debug code. For engineers and, specifically, in a DevOps environment, the logs are a very valuable tool.</p>
<p>In addition to the functional aspect of logging, logs are also critical from a Java security perspective. When a security breach occurs, your log files are the first place to look for clues about what happened. But with a large number of different frameworks available for logging in Java applications, how do you pick the right one? More importantly, how to do Java logging right?</p>
<p>The quality of the logs is critical. Logging both too much or too little information can be catastrophic from a Java security perspective. In fact, Insufficient Logging &amp; Monitoring (A10:2017) has made the OWASP Top 10 list.</p>
<p>In this article, I am going to guide you through a pragmatic approach to Java logging—what should we log, what shouldn’t we log, and how to implement Java logging properly.</p>
<h3>What Should We Log?</h3>
<p>Back in the military, whenever we had to report something, we had to use the 5W-H method—Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How. This method is an excellent rule for logging statements as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Who was doing this?</strong> Identify the user or system that made this request. If possible, with a userID and an IP address.</li>
<li><strong>What is going on?</strong> What kind of logging statement was this. Many developers already recognize the different log-levels to annotate the importance of a message (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE). It is wise to distinguish between functional logging, security logging, and maybe even audit logging if that is applicable.</li>
<li><strong>Where did it happen?</strong> Identify the location. You usually define a logger per class, so that is already a good start. However, we also need to know the specific method. Also, we want to know the particular node, if you are working with a microservice architecture, for instance.</li>
<li><strong>When did it occur? </strong>Time is essential, so make sure you log a timestamp. Be aware of timezone differences and, more importantly, change timezones twice a year. My advice is to always output in UTC, so it is clear to everyone.</li>
<li><strong>Why did it happen? </strong>The “why” is generally what you need to find out. You can’t always capture this in a single logline. In some cases, it is obvious. If so, make it part of the message. On many occasions, we can only explain the “why” once we see the relation between logs. Therefore make sure that your log messages are absolutely clear.</li>
<li><strong>How did it happen? </strong>Like the “why,” the “how” typically can’t be caught in one statement. Therefore, to correlate between message, especially in a service-based architecture, is extremely important. To achieve this, you should create a unique correlation ID for each incoming request in every service with an outbound interface. Once you have this ID, you should log it in every statement. If you need to transport this ID to another service, you can use the specific HTTP header X-Correlation-ID in order to correlate and be stateless.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Logging Security Events</h3>
<p>Java is mostly used in backend processes and will directly interact with the data. Therefore, we must keep track of security-related events. We have to prioritize these security events accordingly and consider events that need high privileges (admin events) even more critical.</p>
<p>In general, you can think of:</p>
<ul>
<li>login success and failures</li>
<li>logouts</li>
<li>password changes and resets</li>
<li>creation and removal of users</li>
<li>authorization failures</li>
<li>access level changes</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you should also log indicators that can point to specific attacks.</p>
<ul>
<li>input validation errors: recognize script tags that lead to XSS attacks, or parameters like UNION that indicate a SQL-injection</li>
<li>HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses</li>
<li>getting insane amounts of requests by a specific IP</li>
<li>check IP ranges, for instance, if an internal service gets hit by an external IP-address</li>
</ul>
<p>It is a great tactic to set thresholds for certain security log events. You can actively send alerts when these thresholds are crossed. This way, you can - interfere accordingly and prevent more extensive damage.</p>
<h3>What Should We Not Log?</h3>
<p>Logging too much information is just as harmful as logging too little. You do not want your logs to be flooded by information that is not useful in production. Therefore, aim to always set the log level on a production system to a suitable level, like WARN or ERROR.</p>
<p>As part of development, engineers will log sensitive entities that might contain personal data, in order to debug applications. Although we should aim to prevent this, internal debug messages should have the proper log level—for example, DEBUG or TRACE—and should not be visible in the production environment.</p>
<p>As a general rule, an application should not reveal any application-specific or user-specific data—this data can be used by an attacker. Also, by exposing personal information, you are most probably not compliant with privacy regulations. Even if logs are only accessible to insiders, it is a single point of failure. So, we simply don’t want this information to fall into the wrong hands.</p>
<p>When developing, think about what you need to log. Do we need to log an internal ID, the unencrypted password, or someone’s credit card details? Be careful not to output a complete data object in Java as the output depends on the <code>toString()</code> method of that particular object.</p>
<p>By logging personal information for debugging, we circumvent many of our own security policies—it would be sensible not to log these types of information altogether. If we need to log specific data, make sure to set the proper log-level, such as DEBUG. You should also set the log-level of the production system to a higher level, like WARN.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line—personal and sensitive information must not appear in your production logging.</strong></p>
<h3>Security Logging in Java</h3>
<p>First and foremost, use a logging framework in Java. This seems like an open door, but in a ton of applications, people still use the old System.out.println() to write directly to the console. This should be prevented at all costs. A good linter (Spotbugs, PMD, SonarLint) could help you with this.</p>
<p>There are many different logging frameworks in Java. This article will focus on Logback and Log4j2, as these are currently the most used frameworks. However, regardless of the framework, it is wise to separate security logging from general application logging. In both Logback and Log4j2, you can easily do this by adding markers to the logger. With a specific marker, like SECURITY or maybe even AUDIT, you can easily filter these out in your logs. You could also add an extra appender to your logger and filter on the specific marker to store or display these logs separately.</p>
<h4>Logback</h4>
<p>To implement Logback, you only need the <code>logback-classic</code> dependency, as shown below. This will pull in both <code>logback-core</code> and the <code>slf4j-api</code> packages.</p>
<pre><code><code data-enlighter-language="java">&lt;dependency&gt;
   &lt;groupId&gt;ch.qos.logback&lt;/groupId&gt;
   &lt;artifactId&gt;logback-classic&lt;/artifactId&gt;
   &lt;version&gt;1.2.3&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code></code></pre>
<h5><span>Markers</span></h5>
<p>Markers can be set with any given String and added to your logger regardless of the log level, as you see below.</p>
<pre><code><code data-enlighter-language="java">private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(LogbackExample.class);
private static final Marker security = MarkerFactory.getMarker("SECURITY");

public boolean  login(String userName, String encryptedPassword) {
   logger.warn(security, "login attempt by user: {}", userName);
  ...
}</code></code></pre>
<h5><span>Configuration</span></h5>
<p>In the following example of Logback configuration, I have created two appenders to my <code>logback.xml</code> file.</p>
<p>The first appender will show all the log lines in the console, including the marker I might have added. The second appender only filters out the security-specific logs based on the maker SECURITY and put these in a separate security log file per day.</p>
<pre><code><code data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;configuration&gt;
   &lt;appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender"&gt;
       &lt;encoder&gt;
           &lt;pattern&gt;%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-8marker %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n&lt;/pattern&gt;
       &lt;/encoder&gt;
   &lt;/appender&gt;
   &lt;timestamp key="byDay" datePattern="yyyyMMdd"/&gt;
   &lt;appender name="SECURITY-FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender"&gt;
       &lt;filter class="ch.qos.logback.core.filter.EvaluatorFilter"&gt;
           &lt;evaluator class="ch.qos.logback.classic.boolex.OnMarkerEvaluator"&gt;
               &lt;marker&gt;SECURITY&lt;/marker&gt;
           &lt;/evaluator&gt;
           &lt;OnMatch&gt;ACCEPT&lt;/OnMatch&gt;
           &lt;OnMismatch&gt;DENY&lt;/OnMismatch&gt;
       &lt;/filter&gt;
       &lt;file&gt; security-${byDay}.log&lt;/file&gt;
       &lt;append&gt;true&lt;/append&gt;
       &lt;encoder&gt;
           &lt;pattern&gt;%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-8marker %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n&lt;/pattern&gt;
       &lt;/encoder&gt;
   &lt;/appender&gt;
   &lt;root level="warn"&gt;
       &lt;appender-ref ref="STDOUT" /&gt;
       &lt;appender-ref ref="SECURITY-FILE" /&gt;
   &lt;/root&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;</code></code></pre>
<h4>Log4j2</h4>
<p>To use, you have to include the <code>log4j-api</code> and the <code>log4j-core</code> package, as seen below.</p>
<pre><code><code data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;dependency&gt;
   &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.logging.log4j&lt;/groupId&gt;
   &lt;artifactId&gt;log4j-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;
   &lt;version&gt;2.13.3&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;

&lt;dependency&gt;
   &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.logging.log4j&lt;/groupId&gt;
   &lt;artifactId&gt;log4j-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
   &lt;version&gt;2.13.3&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code></code></pre>
<h5><span>Markers</span></h5>
<p>Creating and adding the markers is similar to the Logback example; only this time, we use the specific Log4j manager to create the logger and the marker.</p>
<pre><code><code data-enlighter-language="java">private static final Logger logger = LogManager.getLogger(Log4j2Example.class);
private static final Marker security = MarkerManager.getMarker("SECURITY");

public boolean login(String userName, String encryptedPassword) {
   logger.warn(security, "login attempt by user: {}", userName);
  ...
}</code></code></pre>
<h5><span>Configuration</span></h5>
<p>Similar to the Logback configuration, I created a configuration for Log4j2 with two appenders where the security log will get stored in a separate file based on the markers. This configuration needs to be in the <code>log4j2.xml</code> on the classpath.</p>
<pre><code><code data-enlighter-language="xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;Configuration&gt;
   &lt;Appenders&gt;
       &lt;Console …</code></code></pre></article></section></section></div>

    <p>As technology advances, we are distracted by more things than ever, and it is getting harder to draw a strict line between work and free time. There are several time management techniques offering help to make ourselves more effective while working. One of the most acknowledged among them is the Pomodoro technique. The best approach is to download a Pomodoro timer app, so we help you below to navigate the solution landscape.</p>

<p>As I take a look around my desk, while writing this article, I see at least a dozen physical and virtual elements that distract me. Working from home office during the quarantine did even amplify my inner voices saying: “Chat with your friends instead.”, “That email could be extremely important!”, “Aren’t you hungry?”</p>
<p>Time management issues are among the hottest topics when it comes to organizing work. The above distractions cost the global economy billions of dollars as, according to a recent study, almost 80% of an average workday is spent on activities with low value. Distractions, poor prioritization, procrastination lead to in-effective days and longer-than-needed workdays.</p>
<p><strong>The Pomodoro technique</strong> is a method with a single goal in mind: giving a valid, realistic timeframe in which you can focus, while also allowing you to have regular, yet controlled breaks. Pomodoro is a time management method invented by Italian gentleman Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s. It was named after a tomato-shaped timer used in the kitchen working with 25-minute time intervals, the predecessor of today’s Pomodoro timer app solutions. The essence of the Pomodoro technique is to do only one task intensively and focused for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. Then work again for 25 minutes and break again for 5 minutes. After every fourth Pomodoro-interval, take a longer break of 20-30 minutes.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that you can’t sip a cup of coffee during a 25-minute long Pomodoro, rather be prepared with that coffee beforehand, so that you wouldn’t need to get up your chair and with it fall out from the rhythm and paste you were just picking up.</p>
<h2>What makes this technique so powerful?</h2>
<div>
<div>
    <h3>Pomodoro is designed to be easy to start with</h3>
    <p>You do not need to populate page-long matrixes, nor estimate all the work for the whole week. It cannot be simpler! There are Pomodoro timer app solutions that don’t even require registration, making it super-easy to kick-off.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>It helps to avoid multitasking</h3>
    <p>Continuous task-switching, regardless of how good you are in multitasking, heavily affects performance. A study by researcher Laura Bowman at Central Connecticut State University sheds light on what happens during a nowadays standard example of task-switching. Students who used Facebook Messenger while reading a textbook took 25% longer to read the same part (excluding time spent on chatting) than students who only used their time reading. The results clearly showed that the quality of performance deteriorates when concentrating on multiple tasks “simultaneously”.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>It helps battling procrastination</h3>
    <p>Studies show that breaking down tasks to the smallest possible parts helps the brain to see them as easy-to-solve tasks, which eventually will hold back procrastination tendencies.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>It also helps your body</h3>
    <p>Just use part of the 5-min long pauses to move and flex your back, hip, arms, and legs. Changing the focus distance of your eyes once in a while, aka not looking at your monitor constantly, also helps to keep them healthier. </p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Making good use of the Pomodoro technique</h2>
<p>Here are a few tips on how to nurture this technique to achieve your best self.</p>
<div>
<div>
    <h3>Use to-do lists</h3>
    <p>Pomodoro is not simply about pushing a timer or using an app: the number one rule to this technique is to have well-prepared tasks at hand. If you have larger projects, break them down into the smallest parts that you can do. An example: writing an article is a complex project with a lot of research and creative penning. Putting simply “writing an article” on the to-do list is ineffective because it is hard to know how much time and what resources are needed. If you break it down into smaller elements like researching the topic, finding statistics, writing a catchy intro, etc. - that helps your brain to see the big picture and prioritize correctly.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Organize your tasks into pomodoros (tomatoes)</h3>
    <p>These little tomato timeframes should include as many tasks you can handle in a 25-minute long round. The experience will make you better at estimating the right amounts, however, you can do an educated guess if you have done the project breakdown correctly.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Focus, focus, and focus</h3>
    <p>Your 25-minute long Pomodoros should be done with only one thing in mind: finishing your tasks. This might sound too strict at first, but these timeframes are designed in the exact length of an average worker’s/student’s concentration capacity in mind. No emails, no Messenger, and other chats, only your favorite music and the tasks you prepared for yourself.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Applications and websites that support you along the journey</h2>
<p>After the theory, let’s see how the above can be put into practice. While Francesco Cirillo had fewer distractions back in his day, he did not have a Pomodoro technique app to help him focus. Today’s solutions are much more than simple timers. Let’s see what apps out there you can leverage.</p>
<h3>1. <a href="https://www.forestapp.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forest app</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/Forest-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/Forest-logo.png" alt="Forest logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> This application helps you to stay focused and introduces a gamified approach of planting and growing trees. If you start working and use your phone in a non-related way (eg. open Messenger), you get a waring. If you keep switching back from your tasks to less important distractions, your tree will stop growing and will eventually dry out. You are free to set the time frame for how long you want to focus between 10 and 120 minutes. After each period is completed, you receive coins in proportion to how long you have not used your phone. (From which you can buy beautiful trees that are just waiting to be grown.)</p>
<p>Moreover, if you are persistent enough, you can plant a real tree in a designated place, which can be a real motivating force. You can listen to the background noise of a Parisian café or a sandy beach to help to focus.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with Pomodoro:</strong> Setting up 25-minute long intervals in Forest will just do the trick. However, measuring quick breaks and long pauses are not yet available. Still, if you are looking for a great Pomodoro timer app, that helps you focus and forces you - in a gamified way - to do so, Forest is a wonderful choice.</p>
<h3>2. <a href="https://www.flatpomodoro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flat Tomato</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/FlatTomato-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/FlatTomato-logo.png" alt="FlatTomato logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOs, macOS</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> This Mac- and iOS-only application is crafted to fulfill every need of a Pomodoro-er. Wonderful design with easy-to-use interfaces supports you along your day of study and work. You can set tasks, start timers for the different intervals and you can also listen to ambient music and background noises, such as ocean waves, to support your focus. And what makes it a top-ranked, best Pomodoro app? It offers smart reports and analytics to understand what you have done, which, to be honest, gives quite the satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with Pomodoro:</strong> The app’s core is the Pomodoro technique, and all its features are designed with that in mind.</p>
<h3>3. <a href="https://www.focustodo.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Focus To-do</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/FocusToDo-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/FocusToDo-logo.png" alt="FocusToDo logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android, macOS, Windows</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> At first, Focus To-Do seems similar to Flat Tomato and at its core, they both are to help you nurture the Pomodoro technique. However, Focus To-Do offers a complete platform to set up different tasks with categorization, prioritization capabilities. By standard Pomodoro and task management can be done via two different solutions using integrations, Focus To-Do offers them under one umbrella.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with Pomodoro:</strong> You will be able to break down your tasks into small pomodoros and organize them throughout your day. This is by far the best Pomodoro technique app if you are looking for an all-in-one solution.</p>
<h3>4. <a href="https://www.focusboosterapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Focus Booster</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/FocusBooster-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/FocusBooster-logo.png" alt="FocusBooster logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> web, iOS, Android, macOS, Windows</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> This solution is close to its competitor, Flat Tomato, but is available on all platforms, including on the web via a browser. Its features are centered on the Pomodoro technique. You can set timers, do the intervals and breaks, and review your data after your session on a minimalist, yet beautiful user interface.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with Pomodoro:</strong> One of the best solutions to utilize the Pomodoro technique as it is easy-to-setup and affordable.</p>
<h3>5. <a href="https://pomofocus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pomofocus</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/Pomofocus-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/Pomofocus-logo.png" alt="Pomofocus logo"></picture> <strong>Platform:</strong> web</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> The most straightforward and minimalistic approach to measure your intervals. You can make the best out of it even as a guest, but then you won't be able to see your results in well-organized charts. If you need to quickly set up your Pomodoro infrastructure, this is the best solution.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with Pomodoro:</strong> Stripped down to its very core is by far the most intuitive Pomodoro solution. No app, no install - use it simply by accessing their website and allowing your browser to notify you.</p>
<h2>What makes a Pomodoro application and website effective?</h2>
<div>
<div>
    <h3>Easy-to-use</h3>
    <p>Any apps should be intuitive to be picked up by users, but it especially stands for solutions meant to make our lives easier. Imagine a software that takes away your time to make you able to get a better performer.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Integrations</h3>
    <p>Managing complex projects nowadays require several software solutions to use and the best way to utilize them is via integrations. Data shared between these apps makes your life so much easier.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Reporting</h3>
    <p>Analytics is key not just for your boss to see your performance, but to show results for yourself. It provides satisfaction to see all the tasks you’ve accomplished.</p>
</div>

Made in Japan in 2005</figcaption></figure>
<p>Today, I would like to show something different, than usual reverse-engineering, that appears on my blog usually. I needed to prepare a Linux distro for myself to be able to run it on my PC. But not the ordinary operating system that we download from webpage, then use fancy graphical installer to select, what we want and where. My goals were very specific. First was to have it custom-compiled. With that in mind there aren’t many choices left (maybe Gentoo?). Second was to not cross 16 MiB boundary. Why exactly that? That’s simple. I have old (15 years old to be precise) SD/MMC card made for Canon of exactly that size. Quick check showed me that this is possible. I tried buildroot and it failed to fulfill second requirement and I decided not to continue, despite the obvious optimizations on kernel modules, I could do. It’s simply too complex for such a simple task. If not buildroot, then let’s go and see how to do such thing from scratch!</p>

<p>Basically the plan is to have custom Linux distro compiled from scratch. It may sound like something incredibly complex and hard to do. But it’s not. There are just few problems one must learn on how to overcome. The most problematic constraint in my case is, obviously, 16 MiB limit. To not exceed it, I have to use busybox as my userspace. This by the way simplifies distro development significantly. Busybox works the way, that, if linked statically, requires only one, single binary to be able to work correctly. So, to sum up, on software side, we need Linux and busybox. You may wonder, how do I want to boot that system, then? Well. I said I need Linux 🙂 Maybe some people know, some does not, that Linux is itself a boot loader of some kind. At least, when using UEFI and this is what I want to use, it can be loaded directly by UEFI firmware. But that’s another thing to note – I will describe a way to prepare a distro for UEFI – it won’t be as simple as that, for legacy BIOS.</p>
<p>The whole plan will look as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get compiler</li>
<li>Compile Linux kernel</li>
<li>Compile busybox (statically and stripped!)</li>
<li>Prepare initramfs with whole userspace</li>
<li>Format drive as EFI System Partition</li>
<li>Combine kernel and initramfs into single binary</li>
<li>Optionally sign the binary, in case we want Secure Boot to be enabled</li>
<li>Add entry to embedded UEFI boot manager</li>
</ol>
<p>In the meantime, I am going to show few ways to debug the system, in case of any problems.<span id="more-1624"></span></p>

<p>This is maybe not so obvious, but you need new compiler. Most likely, you could use the one that your distro provides, aliased as simply gcc. But this way, you will by the way use glibc as your standard library. For a lightweight system, glibc does not fit well, as this is most heavyweight libc, we have available. Therefore, I will use uClibc. And for that, we need a compiler. Or, to be precise, a toolchain. A toolchain, consisting of kernel headers, uClibc and gcc. Here, I could show, how to build such thing from scratch. But it’s not a tutorial about building a toolchain. This requires knowledge that can fill another tutorial. Instead, I will use the toolchain prepared by my latest project – <a href="https://github.com/v3l0c1r4pt0r/cc-factory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cc-factory</a>. For those, who did not read <a href="https://re-ws.pl/2020/10/meet-cc-factory-a-factory-for-cross-compilers/">my previous post</a>, it is toolchain factory running in Docker container, that provides a recipe for a toolchain that just works. If you tried compiling a toolchain from scratch in the past, then you know that this can fail, even if you use crosstool-ng. With cc-factory, it works as long as Docker can start a service and has Docker Hub working. But enough of that. In cc-factory, I am experimenting with releasing binary distributions of my toolchain. And <a href="https://github.com/v3l0c1r4pt0r/cc-factory/releases/tag/x86_64-gcc10.2.0-linux5.9.13-uclibc1.0.36-1">newest one</a> is special-made for this job. You can simply download it to you disk with:</p>
<pre>wget <span>'</span><span>https://github.com/v3l0c1r4pt0r/cc-factory/releases/download/x86_64-gcc10.2.0-linux5.9.13-uclibc1.0.36-1/x86_64-gcc10.2.0-linux5.9.13-uclibc1.0.36-1.tar.gz</span><span>'</span>
</pre>
<p>After that, you have to install it to your <code>/opt</code> directory with:</p>
<pre>tar <span>-xvf</span> x86_64-gcc10.<span>2</span>.0-linux5.<span>9</span>.13-uclibc1.<span>0</span>.36-1.tar.gz <span>-C</span> /
</pre>
<p>If you prefer another installation path, then head onto cc-factory project to see, how to build one from source. Then, you can choose whatever path, you like for this SDK.</p>
<p>Next step is to export SDK’s bin directory to you PATH for convenience:</p>
<pre><span>export</span> <span>PATH</span>=<span>"</span><span>$PATH</span><span>:/opt/x86_64-linux-uclibc/bin</span><span>"</span>
</pre>
<p>Now, it’s nice to check, if toolchain works. Let’s write one-liner C hello world program to your temp directory, compile and run:</p>
<pre><span>echo</span><span> -e </span><span>'</span><span>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nint main() {printf("Hello, World!\\n");}</span><span>'</span> <span>&gt;</span>/tmp/main.c
x86_64-linux-uclibc-gcc <span>-static</span> <span>-o</span> /tmp/main /tmp/main.c
/tmp/main
</pre>
<p>And you should see the familiar text on your screen. You are ready to go!</p>

<p>That is, in my opinion, the easiest part. First, we have to download kernel image, that we want to use. For that purpose, we need to go to <a href="https://www.kernel.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kernel Archives</a> and download latest stable tarball. Optionally, we can download PGP signature and verify its correctness. But this is outside the scope of this tutorial. Another option to get kernel is to clone its stable repo with:</p>
<pre>git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git
</pre>
<p>This is the path, I chose, because I don’t like leaving multiple copies of kernel sources on my hard drive, so I prefer to have one, central clone of repo and use for any project, I need it to.</p>
<p>In case of tarball, it now has to be unpacked with usual:</p>
<pre>tar <span>-xvf</span> linux-*.tar.gz
</pre>
<p>Then, in case of tarball, you got directory with name dependent on you kernel version, in case of git repo, it is simply linux. So we can cd into it, in any of the above cases:</p>
<pre><span>cd</span> linux*
</pre>
<p>In theory at this point, we could set the compiler, we prepared to be run by kernel buildsystem. But this is optional, as we target <code>x86_64</code> platform, that we run our host on, so default compiler should be as good as uClibc variant. I case, you want to use custom one, you have to export the following:</p>
<pre><span>export</span> <span>CROSS_COMPILE</span>=x86_64-linux-uclibc-
</pre>
<p>Now, we have to configure our kernel.</p>
<p>First step is to choose defconfig. Possible values can be listed in case of x86 with:</p>
<pre><span>ls</span> arch/x86/configs/
</pre>
<p>At the time of writing this returned the following options:</p>
<pre>i386_defconfig tiny.config x86_64_defconfig xen.config
</pre>
<p>As you can see, there are only a few. So, we do:</p>
<pre>make x86_64_defconfig
</pre>
<p>At this point, we are ready to compile. In case, you want to do some modifications, you could do:</p>
<pre>make menuconfig
</pre>
<p>And select (or deselect) some options there. If you think, you are ready, you can type:</p>
<pre>make <span>-j</span>
</pre>
<p>And wait couple of minutes (up to half an hour), depending on speed of your PC. Afterwards, you should see that <code>bzImage</code> has been made and is available at <code>arch/x86/boot/bzImage</code>. We can copy it somewhere in order to not accidentally start its recompilation:</p>
<pre>cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage ../
</pre>
<h2>Testing on hardware</h2>
<p>At this point, it is possible to run the kernel on our system. If you don’t have Secure Boot enabled, then you can try to copy the kernel to you EFI System Partition (wherever it is, I will call this path <code>ESP</code> from now on). But first create new directory for your distro:</p>
<pre><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> ESP/EFI/linux
cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage ESP/EFI/linux/linuxx64.efi
</pre>
<p>I am changing the name in the meantime, as I heard that some systems does not like binaries without <code>.efi</code> extension. Now, we can try to boot.There is more than one way to do it. The one that works always is to utilize EFI firmware directly. But this one differs significantly between manufacturers, so if you prefer that one, please refer to his support pages. The other is to use one of existing tools. For sure KeyTool, that manages Secure Boot keys, is able to start any executable from ESP by browsing the filesystem. But the way I would like to show is, by using so called EFI shell. Why? Because EFI shell allows us to experiment with kernel parameters, by simply typing them, as we would start new user program. And, in fact, from EFI perspective, we simply start a new program.</p>
<p>There are many shells in the wild. I tried EDK2, that is available on Arch as <code>edk2-shell</code> package. It is then available at <code>/usr/share/edk2-shell/x64/Shell.efi</code> You can simply copy it to <code>ESP</code>, just like with kernel, then you have to add it to your EFI boot manager, or use boot manager that is able to autodetect it. You can find a bunch of resources on how to do it, even from inside Linux. But, please do not add the kernel, you copied in such way, to boot manager, as we will play with it a bit, later. Now, in EFI shell, you will be presented with a list of partitions, that the shell has detected. This might be not so obvious at first, but, somehow, you have to identify the one, that is you EFI partition. You should see a similar numbering to the one you see in Linux console, when you list with e.g. <code>lsblk</code>. You can try guessing it by typing its name, in similar way as in Windows, e.g.:</p>
<pre>FS0:
</pre>
<p>to switch to <code>FS0</code> partition. Then you can simply type ls to list its content. Once, you found the right one, it’s worth to remember it, as you might need it couple of times. How many, depends on how many problems, you would have.</p>
<p>Then go to the directory, where you copied your kernel:</p>
<pre><span>cd</span> EFI\linux
</pre>
<p>And ls to make sure, it is there. Now, we are ready to call it:</p>
<pre>linuxx64.efi
</pre>
<p>Yes. It’s as simple as that. But this will fail. We did not provide any root filesystem for our kernel, so it will gonna panic. But don’t worry, as long as reason of the panic is like that:</p>
<pre>not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
</pre>
<p>then it was expected. In case of any other error, act accordingly, as this may be hardware dependent. So, probably, something has to be reconfigured in menuconfig.</p>
<h2>Testing in qemu</h2>
<p>It’s quite a nice option to be able to test your work on real hardware. However, in my opinion, it is much easier to do it in virtualized environment, that you can quickly reset at any time and where you would have latest binaries for testing, all the time, without wasting time for flashing them somewhere. Therefore I recommend to prepare qemu as such environment.</p>
<p>For that, you will need …</p></div></article></div>

Every day until December 24th you will get an article, video or other functional programming related content that hopefully will make the waiting feel a bit shorter! 😄</p>
</section><article><section><p>As previous years the articles will span a large range of topics and complexity. If you are looking for something beginner friendly, or more advanced topics, there should be something for everyone these next 23 days.</p>
<p>Let’s start this advent of with a look at the basics: what is functional programming (FP)? This question has been answered many times before, in many different ways. <a href="https://functional.christmas/2019/1">We took our own stab at it last year</a>. Even though there are no single definition for FP and many different ways to approach it, there are some things that are shared throughout the related communities.</p>

<p>Today I want to use the words and pictures of Russ Olsen and highlight his talk from GOTO 2018. Russ is a great communicator and I love the down to earth and practical perspective he brings in this talk. He explains functional programming in an understandable way and shows why people prefer FP. I hope you enjoy! </p>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          The QEMU Advent Calendar 2020 features a QEMU disk image each day of
          December until the 24th. Each day a new package becomes available
          for download.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every download contains a little 'run' shell script that starts the
          QEMU emulator with the recommended parameters for the disk image.
          Disk images are either contained directly in the download or are
          downloaded by the 'run' script (you need to have installed 'curl' or
          'wget' in that case).
        </p>
        <p>
          The disk images contain interesting operating systems and software
          that run under the QEMU emulator. Some of them are well-known or
          not-so-well-known operating systems, old and new, others are custom
          demos and neat algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 'run' scripts (and disk images if included in the download)
          were created by volunteers from the QEMU community to showcase cool
          software that QEMU can run.

  </figure><p>To set up your work environment for success, you need to reduce distractions.</p><ul><li><strong>Close Apps you are not using.</strong> I use an app called <a href="https://marco.org/apps" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Quitter</a> by Marco Arment. It lets you set up rules to close your apps after a set amount of time of it being inactive.</li><li><strong>Organize your files and folders.</strong> It’s a good idea to try to keep projects isolated to their own folder so they are easier to find. <em>I plan to write more about this one in a later article</em>.</li><li><strong>Tweak your notifications.</strong> If you can get away with turning on Do Not Disturb on your computer, this will be the most effective. But if you are expected to be prompt to slack messages and emails this may be a bit more tricky.</li><li><strong>Block distracting websites.</strong> Taking a 5-minute break on reddit can lead to you looking at cats that like loafs of bread an hour later. For Mac, there is a great app called <a href="https://selfcontrolapp.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Self Control</a> that lets you block certain websites for a set amount of time. The best part is that it’s very hard to get around this filer.</li><li><strong>Buy a good pair of noise-canceling headphones</strong> and find some music that helps you get into a flow state. I have a pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HVLUR86/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ATH-M50x</a> that have been my loyal choice for over 5 years (Not Sponsored <em>yet</em>). Music is one of the most underrated tools for programmers.</li></ul><h2 id="organize-your-tasks">Organize your tasks!</h2><p>For organizing tasks, it's useful to stick to analog. Yes, analog. I bet you thought this was going to be about cool apps huh? Nope, let me introduce you to this cool little thing called Bullet Journaling.</p><h3 id="bullet-journaling">Bullet Journaling</h3><p>At first, I was skeptical of this system but the more I have used it, the more I have fallen in love with it.</p><p>The best approach for bullet journaling is using <em>good ‘ol pencil and paper</em>. Digital apps have the flaw of being in an environment that is full of distractions.</p><figure>

  </figure><p>All you need to get started is:</p><ul><li>A blank or dotted journal 📓</li><li>A pen 🖋</li><li>A passion to get things done. ✍️</li></ul><p>It all starts with an index page. This page will keep your journal organized. Then you create a Future Log, A monthly log, and a daily log. The reason why this system works so well for developers with ADHD is that it's easy to tweak. If you want to have a page for your doodles of Triforces, go for it. If you want to create an elaborate health and fitness tracker, you can do it.</p><p>If you need inspiration, there is no shortage of creative posts on Pintrest and Instagram.</p><p>For more info on Bullet Journaling, I recommend reading the <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p><p>I also recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkZEEQG6IVE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How To ADHD’s video</a> on bullet journaling.</p><h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2><p>Exercise has proven time and time again to be an excellent tool for just about everything.</p><p>On the mornings where I am not hitting the snooze button until the last moment, I try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise. I notice improvements in my mood and the ability to solve problems quicker.</p><p>It doesn’t need to be intense if you are starting your fitness journey, A walk around the park can do a lot for the mind. Proper exercise <a href="https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/adult-adhd-and-exercise#1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is shown</a> to reduce most symptoms of ADHD.</p><h2 id="time-management">Time Management</h2><h3 id="pomodoro-timers">Pomodoro Timers</h3><p>Pomodora timer is a system to make sure you stay focused on a task followed by a short break.</p><p>This is an easy way to ensure that you are giving your mind time to relax and not hyper-focus for too long. Every 25 minutes or so, you take a 5-minute break. Then after 3 “Pomodoras”, you take a 15-minute break. This system forces you to stick to a task with a promised reward of time you can do whatever you want without feeling guilty. That’s the beauty of this system. I’m using one right now while I write this.</p><figure>

I shared the tools I have used to keep myself accountable and productive. Every one of them I have used myself. While these may or may not work for you I encourage you to try them. I also recommended finding a community to talk about ADHD without judgment.</p><p>Here are a couple good ones:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">/r/ADHD</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NeurodiverseSquad" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#NeruoDiverseSquad</a> on Twitter</li></ul><p>One last thing, Embrace ADHD. Don’t be too hard on yourself when a system doesn’t work for you. Your brain is different. We are programmed to notice small details and think outside of the box. Change is hard and the worst thing you can do is think you are defective.</p><p>I live by this quote from BJ Fogg, the author of <a href="https://www.tinyhabits.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tiny Habits</a>.</p><blockquote><p>People change best by feeling good, not by feeling bad.</p></blockquote></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p><em>Part 1: How your user experience changes for the worse as the open web gives way to walled gardens</em></p><p>I hang out in two circles. Open web enthusiasts that are lamenting its demise, and regular users who are happy with their fast snappy apps and couldn't care less. </p><p>These groups have a hard time talking because the "open web" too often comes across as an idealistic abstract notion and most end users just don't tangibly feel the bad consequences. In fact, they're often happier with the snappy, vertically integrated experience of closed app ecosystems. </p><p>My goal here is to make it more palpable how everyday apps, searches and tools get worse when we let big centralized companies take over the web, and explore some paths for reversing it.</p><h2>What is the open web?</h2><p>Most definitions of the "open web" I've seen are either too technical to be accessible or too abstract to be usable and getting gridlocked in this debate often means watching from the sidelines while actual user welfare slowly diminishes.</p><p>Three characteristics that proponents of the open web will agree to in roughly descending order are:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease of publishing</strong>: anyone can publish to it freely or at least very cheaply, and is on the same footing with a globally accessible URL</li><li><strong>Ease of consuming</strong>: Net neutrality — ISP's dont cut deals with corporations to make some websites load faster or cheaper than others.</li><li><strong>Ease of remixing</strong>. You can see the source code. Content licenses and tools are permissive for derived works.</li></ul><h2>Detour: A framework to break down how people use the web</h2><p>I want to focus on the user experience point of view. To do this, I'm going to introduce a framework that divides up all our internet usage into two categories.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/xscGdbWOOPkGjdER.png" alt="Frame 1.png"></p><h3><strong>Unfamiliar problems</strong></h3><p>You have an unfamiliar problem and to solve it you either need to learn something new, or purchase goods or services to solve it</p><ul><li>e.g. taking out a mortgage, a health problem in the family, where to go to college, what skill to acquire next.</li><li>Unfamiliar problems are solved in large part with acquiring new knowledge, not just products or services.</li><li>These user journeys start with search engines — Google predominantly and **a lot of the time solving them is spent on web pages**.</li><li>When people are looking to solve unfamiliar problems, **revenue is typically higher-margin**, because users can't price the products and services as well.</li><li>These ultimately transition to being familiar problems.</li></ul><h3><strong>Familiar problems</strong></h3><ul><li>e.g. being entertained, keeping the dog food in stock,</li><li>These are best solved with apps like Email, Netflix, Twitter, DTC subscription boxes, etc.</li><li>Solving these needs has a very well defined user interaction journey. You open the app you're familiar with and follow its standard flow.</li><li>Revenue from people solving familiar problems is typically lower-margin and there's more competing products.
</li></ul><h3>How we're spending our time on familiar vs. unfamiliar problems</h3><p>Using time spent in apps vs mobile web on mobile is a way to proxy how we divide up our time.<strong> We spend most of our time on familiar problems but have a constant trickle of unfamiliar problems</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/cPuXkKFELALeIAkI.png" alt="Untitled (1).png"></p><h2>Unfamiliar problems are better solved with the open web</h2><p>Think about the last time you did some research, e.g. choosing a phone plan. You asked your friends, compared on forums, looked at the official sites, scribbled some notes and made a decision. Even if this journey was quick, you likely traversed a dozen services and products to do this.</p><p>Unfamiliar problems have less constraints, require creativity to solve, and thus are better suited to open solutions. Some other things that work for the open web here</p><ul><li>comparing alternatives is easier.</li><li>changing modalities (e.g. from reading to video) is easier.</li></ul><h2>Familiar problems stand to benefit more from tight vertical integration</h2><p>Take Spotify for example. It solves the very familiar problem of listening to music. Spotify just works better as an app because</p><ul><li>Controlling the user experience end to end makes for smoother flows.</li><li>Having all the user data kept with Spotify allows for better recommendation algorithms.</li><li>Spotify can easily hand off between devices.</li><li>It can run in the background</li></ul><p>Sure, the web can do a bunch of these things, but they're simply not first-class considerations in the open-read-close workflow that the browser was designed for.</p><h2>But the open web can be better for familiar problems too, especially for breaking monopolies</h2><p>Let's look at Amazon. Initially you start buying there because of their "always low prices" and the convenience of 2 day shipping. Over the years you keep shopping there, until you've forgotten that </p><ol><li>free 2 day shipping is now near universal</li><li>amazon isn't often the cheapest place</li></ol><p>On the Amazon app, you see the story around the product that best serves Amazon, not the buyer. Meanwhile, over on Insight you can use the web version and do all these things the app can't.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/ZEblynrLvBsutnlQ.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-17 at 5.42.21 PM.png"></p><p>... and not just that

</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/JVZoTRazmYPZXBQQ.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-17 at 5.59.22 PM.png"></p><h2><strong>How solving unfamiliar problems gets harder too</strong></h2><p>Unfamiliar problems are solved in large part with acquiring new knowledge, not just products or services. The incentives to freely create knowledge that solves unfamiliar problems is lost as the web closes down.</p><ul><li>Google increasingly takes a larger percent of ad revenue as they <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/">start extracting answers from pages and showing them on their search result pages.</a><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/"></a></li><li><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/"></a>Publishers have to either a) paywall their content (e.g. NYTimes) or b) subtly sell products (everyone standing a Wirecutter alternative), or c) ask for donations in order to survive.</li><li>Only a few big name publishers survive. Google and Facebook start sending them more of the traffic that's left, and since domain rank plays a big part in Google's ranking, those that survived assimilate more power and rank better.</li><li>and search engines seem more littered with SEO junk and less actually useful information year over year.</li></ul><h2>In conclusion, and where we fit in.</h2><p>And that's how your user experience slowly degrades, and that's why we stand to suffer as users if we give up the ability to remix software that the web brought us and closed apps are now taking away. </p><p>Our goal with Insight is to give the web (in particular on mobile) a fighting chance by exhibiting how it can be more powerful than a closed ecosystem and give more control to the end-user. We do this by showcasing the web's infinite extensibility and customizability for common use cases like <a href="http://insightbrowser.com/collections/search">search</a>, <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/shopping">shopping</a>, <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/reading">reading</a> and <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/cooking">cooking</a>.</p><p>Insight's advanced features will soon only be available to Pro subscription users but for a limited time we're opening up <strong>lifetime free beta access if you download it via TestFlight below.</strong></p><h3>Coming up in part 2</h3><ul><li>What parts of the open web probably should die off?</li><li>A pragmatic path for what's left of the open web to thrive again.</li></ul><p>We'd love to hear from you, feel free to tweet at or DM us at @<a href="https://twitter.com/insightbrowser">insightbrowser</a>, and my personal Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/abhinavsharma">@abhinavsharma</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>
