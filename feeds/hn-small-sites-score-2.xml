<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>On 8 January 2021 at 14:05 CET the synchronous area of Continental Europe was separated into two parts due to outages of several transmission network elements in a very short time. ENTSO-E has published the first information on the event already on 8 January 2021, followed by an update with geographical view and time sequence on 15 January 2021. Since then, ENTSO-E has analysed a large portion of relevant data aiming to reconstruct the event in detail.</p><p>This second update presents the key findings of detailed analyses, which have a preliminary character subject to new facts, which will emerge in the still ongoing investigation.</p><p>The analysed sequence of events concludes that the initial event was the tripping of a 400 kV busbar coupler in the substation Ernestinovo (Croatia) by overcurrent protection at 14:04:25.9. This resulted in a decoupling of the two busbars in the Ernestinovo substation, which in turn separated North-West and south-east electric power flows in this substation. As shown in Figure 1 below, North-West bound lines which remained connected to one busbar, connect Ernestinovo to Zerjavinec (Croatia) and Pecs (Hungary), while South-East bound lines which remained connected to another busbar, connect Ernestinovo to Ugljevik (Bosnia-Herzegovina) and Sremska Mitrovica (Serbia).</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ca35232da145a366158c9b4df33d787e40d621c9/129ad/assets/graphics/uploads/system-separation-figure-2.jpg" alt="" title="Figure 1 - Decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo"></p><p><em>Figure 1 - Decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo</em></p><p>The separation of flows in the Ernestinovo substation, lead to the shifting of electric power flows to neighbouring lines which were subsequently overloaded. At 14:04:48.9, the line Subotica – Novi Sad (Serbia) tripped due to overcurrent protection. This was followed by the further tripping of lines due to distance protection, as shown in Figure 2, below, leading eventually to the system separation into two parts at 14:05:08.6.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f409f977d1a2b6c2df1e49861416d463445808b0/06d80/assets/graphics/uploads/system-separation-figure-3.png" alt="" title="Figure 2 - Tripping of additional transmission network elements after the decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo"></p><p><em>Figure 2 - Tripping of additional transmission network elements after the decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo</em></p><p>The route where the two parts of the Continental Europe Synchronous Area were separated is shown in Figure 3 below:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/de60ebc1aaeb673286f78d35b23db319639b40f6/35e86/assets/graphics/uploads/thrid.jpg" alt="" title="Figure 3 – Separation of Continental Europe Synchronous Area on 8 January 2021"></p><p><em>Figure 3 – Separation of Continental Europe Synchronous Area on 8 January 2021</em></p><p>The system separation resulted in a deficit of power (approx. -6.3 GW) in the North-West Area and a surplus of power (approx. +6.3 GW) in the South-East Area, resulting in turn in a frequency decrease in the North-West Area and a frequency increase in the South-East Area.</p><p>At approximately 14:05 CET, the frequency in the North-West Area initially decreased to a value of 49.74 Hz within a period of around 15 seconds before quickly reaching a steady state value of approximately 49.84 Hz. At the same time, the frequency in the South-East Area initially increased up to 50.6 Hz before settling at a steady state frequency between 50.2 Hz and 50.3 Hz as illustrated in Figure 4 below:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/af53041f1f9915046a980de1662f685154376b5c/670b8/assets/graphics/uploads/forth.png" alt="" title="Figure 4 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 right after the disturbance and during resynchronisation"></p><p><em>Figure 4 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 right after the disturbance and during resynchronisation</em></p><p>Due to the low frequency in the North-West Area, contracted interruptible services in France and Italy (in total around 1.7 GW) were disconnected in order to reduce the frequency deviation. These services are provided by large customers who are contracted by the respective Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to be disconnected if frequency drops under a certain threshold. In addition, 420 MW and 60 MW of supportive power were automatically activated from the Nordic and Great Britain synchronous areas respectively. These countermeasures ensured that already at 14:09 CET the frequency deviation from the nominal value of 50 Hz was reduced to around 0.1 Hz in the North-West area (Figure 4).</p><p>In order to reduce the high frequency in the South-East Area, automatic and manual countermeasures were activated, including the reduction of generation output (Eg. automatic disconnection of a 975 MW generator in Turkey at 14:04:57). As a consequence, the frequency in the South-East Area returned to 50.2 Hz at 14:29 CET and remained within control limits (49.8 and 50.2 Hz) until the resynchronisation of the two separated areas took place at 15:07:31.6 CET.</p><p>Between 14:30 CET and 15:06 CET the frequency in the South-East area was fluctuating between 49.9 Hz and 50.2 Hz due to the rather small size of the South-East Area where also several production units were disconnected (Figure 5). During this period, the frequency in the North-West Area fluctuated far less and remained close to the nominal value, due to the rather large size of the North-West Area. This frequency behaviour is a subject of further detailed investigation.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/83de537eb517d8e18789e4116bb3561294bf39c8/a45a4/assets/graphics/uploads/graph_nw_se_03_1400h-1515h.jpg" alt="" title="Figure 5 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 for the complete duration "></p><p><em>Figure 5 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 for the complete duration</em></p><p>The automatic response and the coordinated actions taken by the TSOs in Continental Europe ensured that the situation was quickly restored close to normal operation. The contracted interruptible services in Italy and in France were reconnected at 14:47 CET and 14:48 CET respectively prior to the resynchronisation of the North-West and South-East areas at 15:08 CET.</p><p>ENTSO-E continues to keep the European Commission and the Electricity Coordination Group, composed of representatives of Member States, informed and updated with detailed results of the preliminary technical analyses.</p><p>Based on the preliminary technical analyses presented above, a formal investigation following the legal framework under the Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 of 2 August 2017 (System Operation Guideline) will be established, whereby National Regulatory Authorities and ACER are invited to join with TSOs in an Expert Investigation Panel.</p><p>In line with the provisions of the mentioned Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 of 2 August 2017, ENTSO-E will present the results of the investigation to the Electricity Coordination Group and will subsequently publish a report once the analysis is completed.</p><hr><p><strong>Note:</strong> All figures and details about the sequence of the events are still subject to final investigation and possible changes.</p><p><strong>Questions and answers</strong></p><p>What is a system separation?</p><p>The transmission grids of the countries of Continental Europe are electrically tied together to operate synchronously at the frequency of approximately 50 Hz. An event on 8 January 2021 caused the Continental Europe synchronous area to separate into two areas, with an area in the South-East of Europe being temporarily operating in separation from the rest of Continental Europe.</p><p>Is this the first time such an event happens in Continental Europe?</p><p>The Continental Europe synchronous area is one of the largest interconnected synchronous electricity systems in the world in terms of its size and number of supplied customers. Such a kind of event can happen in any electric power system. System resilience and preparedness of system operators in charge have a decisive impact on the consequences of such events. A separation of the synchronous area with a much larger disturbance and impacts on customers took place in Continental Europe on the 4 November 2006. This event was extensively analysed and led to a number of substantial developments, like the European Awareness System (EAS) which is a platform allowing TSOs to exchange operational information in real time, enabling them to react immediately in case of unusual system condition. The TSOs are therefore well prepared in order to coordinate and manage such events and limit the consequences. This preparedness and a permanent observation of the system frequency allowed to resynchronize the two separated areas in a very short period of time.</p><p>How are countermeasures coordinated in Continental Europe in case of frequency deviations?</p><p>In Continental Europe, procedures are in place to avoid system disturbances and especially large frequency deviations with the risk of uncoordinated disconnection of customers or generation. The TSOs Amprion (Germany) and Swissgrid (Switzerland) are responsible for these procedures in their role as synchronous area monitor (SAM) in Continental Europe. The SAM continuously monitors the system frequency. In case of large frequency deviations, they inform all TSOs via the European Awareness System (EAS) and launch an extraordinary procedure for frequency deviations to coordinate countermeasures in a fast and effective manner in order to stabilize the system. One step of this procedure is a telephone conference by Amprion, Swissgrid, RTE (France), Terna (Italy) and REE (Spain). This teleconference took place at 14:09 CET on 8 January 2021. In the telephone conference, the situation was evaluated, the TSOs informed about countermeasures which were already activated. The TSOs of the North-West and South-East Area also coordinated the actions for reconnection in order to reach one synchronous area in Continental Europe again.</p><p>Were end customers disconnected? Were there any other consequences?</p><p>Customers in the order of 70 MW in the North-East Area and in the order of 163 MW in the South-East Area were disconnected. Due to the high resilience of the interconnected network and the rapid response of European TSOs, the security of operation and electricity supply was not endangered further. An important contribution to stabilizing the system was delivered by the previously contracted interruptible services, which were activated in France and Italy. Such contracts which have been agreed with customers allow the TSO to temporarily and automatically reduce the electrical consumption depending on the situation with the electric power system in real-time.</p><p>What is an electrical busbar?</p><p>A busbar is an electrical junction in a substation, which connects overhead lines, cables and transformers through electrical switches. Usually, there are several busbars in a substation, which can be connected by a busbar coupler. Are there special devices protecting the equipment in a substation? Various devices protect the equipment in a substation. One of them is an overcurrent protection relay, disconnecting automatically the equipment (Eg. overhead line or cable) if the electrical …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>Most of the 300,000 + plant species have leaves, and the function of all of them is to perform photosynthesis.&nbsp; They are the ultimate source for all of the oxygen and food for the rest of the food chain and help regulate the global carbon and water cycles.&nbsp; They are also nutrition superstars.&nbsp; To figure out why greens are good for you and whether all leaves are equal in this regard, we need to take quick look at global leaf structural variability and broad evolutionary patterns in the species that make their way onto our tables.<span id="more-937"></span></p>

<p>Across the global flora leaves are extraordinarily structurally variable.&nbsp; They vary in size from a tiny duckweed leaf to a huge palm frond, and in thickness from a thin lettuce leaf to a thick leaf of a succulent aloe or pine needle.&nbsp; We don’t fully understand yet why leaves are so structurally variable across species. My colleagues and I <a title="Osnas et al. Science 2013" href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2013/03/27/science.1231574" target="_blank">recently published a paper</a> demonstrating that across the global flora leaf nutrient concentrations and physiological rates of maximum photosynthetic carbon gain and respiratory carbon loss change in proportion to leaf area more strongly than they change in proportion to leaf mass.&nbsp; We demonstrate the consequences of this area-proportionality of leaf traits for how we measure, analyze and use these leaf traits in models of the global carbon cycle.</p>

<p>Of relevance here, however, is that the high area-proportionality of leaf traits simply means that the parts of the leaf that are most beneficial for humans (digestible protein, vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, digestible fiber) are likely proportional in many species to the leaf’s photosynthetic apparatus, which is clustered in a relatively thin band of cells beneath the epidermis (see image). &nbsp;Adding thickness to a leaf doesn’t necessarily add nutritious tissue and might instead add mostly fibrous, indigestible structural material (see agave photo below). &nbsp;This does not mean that the thinner the leaf, the more nutritious it is; this is just a general tendency across all plants. &nbsp;Scaled up to the level of the whole plant, though, we see that leaves have the highest ratio of nutritious material (digestible protein, vitamins and minerals, fiber) to indigestible material (for most species). &nbsp;Some fruits probably come close, but fruit is rare, and leaves are abundant.</p>

<p>One of the key variables modulating area- vs mass-proportionality of leaf traits is leaf mass per unit leaf area (LMA), which increases with leaf thickness and density. &nbsp;Lettuce leaves have very low LMA, pine needles and holly leaves have high LMA.&nbsp; Although there is very little data on the subject, the leaves that we eat tend to fall on the low end of the global LMA spectrum, shown here for a global dataset of more than 2500 wild species.</p>

<p>Leaf tenderness—reducing LMA–is certainly a trait that has undergone selection in cultivated varieties.&nbsp; In species with varietals that have undergone selection on different structures, the varieties in which selection has been directed at the leaves invariably have more tender, less bitter, and larger leaves than do varieties in which selection has been directed at different structures, such as the roots.&nbsp; For example, chard has larger and more tender greens than do beets (both <i>Beta vulgaris</i>, Caryophyllales); celery grown for stalks and leaves is more tender than the aboveground portion of the celery varietal grown for its root (both <i>Apium graveolens</i>, Apiales); and Siberian kale varieties have more tender leaves than do rutabaga varieties (both <i>Brassica napus</i>, Brassicales).</p>

<p>Kale and collards, grown for their leaves, have leaves that are more tender than those of conspecific <i>Brassica oleracea</i> grown primarily for other structures:&nbsp; kohlrabi, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts (and for those of you keeping track at home, in the <a title="The extraordinary diversity of Brassica&nbsp;oleracea" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/05/the-extraordinary-diversity-of-brassica-oleracea/" target="_blank"><i>B. oleracea</i></a>, <a title="Thanksgiving turnips and the diversity of the genus&nbsp;Brassica" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/598/" target="_blank"><i>Brassica</i></a>, and<a title="The most political vegetables: A whirlwind tour of the edible&nbsp;crucifers" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/the-most-political-vegetables-a-whirlwind-tour-of-the-edible-crucifers/" target="_blank"> Brassicaceae posts</a>,<i> </i>I erroneously lumped all kales into <i>Brassica oleracea</i>—<a title="Brassica napus kales" href="http://seedambassadors.org/Mainpages/still/napuskale/napuskale.htm" target="_blank">some of them are <i>B. napus</i></a>, including my favorite variety: Red Russian kale).&nbsp; Don’t dare throw out your beet, celeriac, rutabaga or <i>B. oleracea </i>greens, though, if you’re lucky enough to get them—they need a bit more cooking or tenderizing, but they’re still delicious and nutritious.&nbsp; At least put your celery root greens in stock.&nbsp; LMA also varies within a varietal based on growing conditions.&nbsp; Leaves grown in sun have higher LMA than leaves grown in shade.&nbsp; The impact of growing conditions within species, however, will have to wait for another time.</p>
<p>LMA is hardly the only determinant of which species make it onto our plates.&nbsp; Otherwise, we’d have our pick of hundreds of species on the low-LMA end of the global curve.&nbsp; Instead, we can put most of our greens species on a fairly legible phylogenetic tree in need of only a few disclaimer paragraphs of omissions.</p>

<p>Like many phylogenetic trees of more than a handful of species, this tree of our “greens species” commits sins of both commission and omission in the interest of producing a readable image. Omission because the species on the tree do not comprise an exhaustive list of species whose leaves people around the globe regularly consume. Commission because I included a few unusual items, such as sweet potato leaves (<i>Ipomoea</i>, Solanales), and pea shoots (Fabales), and a few taxa are single representatives of a large group.&nbsp; Sister to sweet potato on the tree, for example, is the entire family Lamiaceae, the mints.</p>

<p>We mostly use leaves from the mints as herbs and spices:&nbsp; peppermint and spearmint (<i>Mentha </i>sp.), basil (<i>Ocimum</i> sp.), thyme (<i>Thymus</i> sp.), oregano and marjoram (<i>Origanum</i> sp.), rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus</i> sp.), lemon balm (<i>Melissa</i> sp.), lavender (<i>Lavandula</i> sp.), shiso (<i>Perilla frutescens</i>), bee balm (<i>Monarda</i> sp.), and mountain mint (<i>Pycnanthemum</i> sp.).&nbsp; Also, scallions are the only representatives on the tree from the genus <i>Allium</i> in the monocot order Asparagles, which includes many edible species, the leaves of some of which are regularly employed:&nbsp; garlic, <a title="A look at&nbsp;leeks" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2013/03/03/a-look-at-leeks/" target="_blank">leeks</a>, ramps, and onions.</p>
<p>I included some of the more exotic greens in the greens tree both to avoid rousing the ire of their champions and because I was a bit shocked that some large, charismatic orders that feature prominently in the diet at large are reduced to single entries on the greens tree or are gone altogether, meaning we primarily use roots, stems, fruits or seeds from these clades, not leaves.&nbsp; Granted, this “greens tree” is mostly a tree of “greens obtained from Whole Foods and summer farmer’s markets in the continental United States.”</p>

<p>I’ve included a few weedy, wild things that I pick regularly and that one can actually occasionally pay money for at the farmer’s market:&nbsp; nettle (<i>Urtica dioica</i>, Rosales), chickweed (<i>Stellaria media</i>, Caryophyllales), miner’s lettuce (<i>Claytonia perfoliata</i>, Caryophyllales), purslane (<i>Portulaca oleracea</i>, Caryophyllales), and dandelion (<i>Taraxacum officinale</i>, Asterales).&nbsp; Largely, however, I’ve omitted species whose leaves are technically edible, at least in small doses at some point in their life cycle, but that are reduced to curiosities at the modern American table, not staples.&nbsp; Therefore, please hold your fire if you’re shaking your fist at the tree because it omits the young beech (<i>Fagus grandifolia</i>, Fagales), sassafras (<i>Sassafras albidum</i>, Laureles), or violet (<i>Viola odorata</i>, Malpighiales) leaves you like to nibble on when you hike east of the Mississippi. Fern fiddlehead (assorted Polypodiales) enthusiasts, too, forgive me. &nbsp;We use some leaves to prepare other food: &nbsp;banana leaves and corn husks to wrap&nbsp;<em>tamales</em>, and palm fronds and fig leaves to wrap fish for baking or grilling. &nbsp;I salute these leaves, but they’re not on the tree. &nbsp;Some are gone simply because I didn’t have room, such as many of the <a title="The most political vegetables: A whirlwind tour of the edible&nbsp;crucifers" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/the-most-political-vegetables-a-whirlwind-tour-of-the-edible-crucifers/">crucifer greens</a>, and asterids chrysanthemum, borage and comfrey (although those last two haven’t been placed to order yet and would therefore have been difficult to place within the asterids anyway).</p>

                    <p>An alarm clock for the rest of us</p><p>It’s a brand new year, which means I should really start writing a new post.
I’ve been wanting to for a while, but we’ve been in lockdown for two months now and Google Analytics is the only indication that I’m not alone on the planet, and most of that is bots anyway.
I’ve decided to take a page out of the book of my friend, <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/">James Stanley</a>, who both does cool things <em>and</em> actually writes about them, so I’m starting to document all my projects again.</p>
<p>Given my non-frenetic, slow-paced lifestyle, I’ve long had a non-burning need.
I don’t use an alarm to wake up, as I start work late, but I still want to know what time it is when I wake up, just to see if it’s way too early and I can go to sleep again.
A few days a week I have tennis and need to get up early, but if it’s windy or rainy or very cold, the practice gets canceled and I want to know before I’m awake enough to not be able to go to sleep again.</p>
<p>To accommodate this lifestyle, I’ve traditionally turned to my mobile phone, but that has some disadvantages.
Namely, the screen is too bright and wakes me up when I check the time, and I’m too obsessive to not check all my messages instead of falling asleep when I see the notifications on the screen.
I’ve long thought that a bedside alarm clock would be perfect for me, but I couldn’t find one that fulfilled all my requirements:</p>
<!-- break -->

<ul>
<li>I needed something that had a screen that would always be always lit, so I could check the time with one eye and half a brain awake, in the complete darkness of the bedroom.</li>
<li>A screen that wasn’t too bright and wouldn’t disturb sleep, but that would also be legible in direct sunlight, so I could see the time during the day.
This meant adaptive brightness.</li>
<li>Octagonal shape so I can lay it down on its side (or at 45°) instead of having to crane my neck up to check the time when lying down (I really did think of everything).</li>
<li>Weather forecast for the next hour or two, so I can reliably fail to wake up for tennis when not necessary.</li>
<li>Annoying beeper for alarms.</li>
<li>Less annoying built-in LEDs that would increase in brighness for a few minutes before an alarm went off, so I can wake up less annoyed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the result:</p>

<p>Conceptually, making an alarm clock to fulfill these requirements isn’t hard.
You take a small OLED screen, an ESP8266, connect them together, add some LEDs and a buzzer, and you’re done!
Since the hardware was more-or-less straightforward, I started with designing the octagonal case:</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/clock-back.png" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/clock-back-small.png"></a></p><p><span>The back of the clock.</span></p></div><p>The OLED screen has four mounting holes, so I designed the mount around them.
For the ESP8266, I use a WeMos D1 Mini board, as it’s quite small and nice to work with.
I initially thought I’d have to connect the WeMos to the four pins of the screen with wires, but I discovered that if you kinda squint, you can get four of the ESP8266’s pins to match up with the screen’s pins and in the correct order, which means I could solder the ESP8266 behind the screen module directly, which simplified the wiring by a lot.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/mockup.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/mockup-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>Look at that subtle off-white coloring.</span></p></div><p>While designing the clock, I created a quick mockup of the screen as I wanted it to show.
I decided I wanted the hour to be displayed in as big letters as possible, since this screen is small, and the other elements I wanted were wind speed, temperature and weather forecast for the next hour.</p>
<p>The other components left to add were a photoresistor (for sensing ambient light), a buzzer and a LED strip.
They were all straightforward to add, the resistor is connected to the ESP8266’s analog pin, and the buzzer and LED strip to some other free pins.</p>
<h2>The software</h2>
<p>The software was the slightly trickier part in this build, although that was pretty straightforward too.
I needed multiple components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting the time somehow (there’s no real-time clock on the ESP8266 and I didn’t want to add one).</li>
<li>Dimming the screen in a pleasing manner.</li>
<li>Getting the weather forecast and current weather.</li>
<li>Connecting to WiFi and autoupdating.</li>
<li>Annoying me into wakefulness in a satisfactory manner.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The clock</h3>
<p>There’s an old Chinese saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>To know the time, you must first connect to the internet.</p>
<p>– Sun Inc</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily, connecting to the Internet is very easy with tzapu’s <a href="https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager">excellent WiFiManager</a> library.
The clock creates an access point, you join it with your phone or computer, give it your WiFi network’s password, and you’re done.</p>
<p>After connecting, an NTP library can fetch the time every so often from the closest server, so the clock is always up to date.
It was important to me that this clock is solid enough to trust with my most important wake-up alarms, and it achieves this goal admirably (unless the internet connection is down).</p>
<p>That also takes care of autoupdates, since I have a simple, secure autoupdate machine I set up using <a href="https://gitlab.com/stavros/espota-server">ESPOTA-server, an autoupdate server I wrote for the ESP8266</a>.
The clock checks for a new update every day, and automatically downloads and installs it.
This way, distributing updates will work reliably, even to millions of devices, for when you realize that collecting all the users’ personal data is slightly monetizable.</p>
<h3>The dimming</h3>
<p>After a bit (or a lot) of searching, I finally found how to dim the OLED screen, and another important feature was well on the way of being implemented.
Because it was rather hard to find, I’ll post the code here, along with the appropriate SEO keyword for people to be able to find it.
Here is the code for dimming an SSD1306-compatible, I2C 128x64 OLED screen:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>void</span> <span>brightnessTask</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>brightness</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Set the brightness of the SSD1306 OLED screen with this hack.</span>
    <span>// From https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFpXfSnDNSY.</span>
    <span>// `brightness` should be a value between 5 (for some reason) and 255.</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>SSD1306_SETCONTRAST</span><span>);</span> <span>//0x81</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>brightness</span><span>);</span>

    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>SSD1306_SETPRECHARGE</span><span>);</span> <span>//0xD9</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>

    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>SSD1306_SETVCOMDETECT</span><span>);</span> <span>//0xDB</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Once I discovered that, the rest of the dimming was easy:
I would just read the ambient light from the photoresistor and set the screen’s brightness according to the photoresistor’s value.</p>
<p>Another job <del>well</del> done.</p>
<h3>The weather</h3>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot1.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot1-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>What a beauty.</span></p></div><p>Getting the weather was easier than I thought.
<a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeather</a> has a simple API, which accepts a pair of coordinates and gives you the current weather and forecast for that location.
It only took a few minutes to fetch that data on the clock, and then I spent some time positioning them on the screen and turning the forecast into an appropriate icon so it could be displayed on the small screen.</p>
<p>To display the icons, I used <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/overview">Adafruit’s always helpful GFX library</a> and converted the OpenWeather icons to a format more suitable for display on a monochrome screen.
This took a bit of trial and error, as I wanted the icons to be easily distinguishable at a glance, even though their size was 12x12 pixels and just one color.
In the end, I think they worked out well, as it’s easy to tell if it’s raining or not.</p>
<h3>The wakefulness</h3>
<p>So the initial plan here was to have a buzzer buzz loudly and annoyingly in an attempt to wake me up.
However, I am a pretty light sleeper, and I hate loud and annoying sounds (surprisingly), so I wanted this to be a last resort.
The solution I came up with here is the following:</p>
<p>Say I want to set the alarm for 9:30, just in time to be ten minutes late for tennis.
The LEDs would start glowing very faintly at 9:20, slowly increasing in intensity over the next ten minutes, at which point they’d reach maximum.
If I still wasn’t up by then, the buzzer would begin beeping at the top of its lung, hopefully waking me up reliably.
This seemed like a pretty good algorithm, and one that would both wake me up pleasantly and reliably.</p>
<p>There was only one problem:
The clock doesn’t have any buttons or controls or any way for me to enter the alarm time.
I could create a web server where I could configure alarms, but I figured I’d rather get a rooster instead, so I did neither and just made an alarm clock that cannot alarm.
This symbolizes the futility of human existence and its incessant search for meaning in a cold and unfeeling universe that’s ultimately profoundly devoid of such, and then you die.</p>
<p>Not having to wake up to a buzzer is cool, though.</p>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>Overall, I’m pretty happy with this clock!
I can now open an eyelid, look at the time and fall asleep again, which is a massive quality-of-life improvement over the previous “fuck sleep I’ve got Instagram likes” situation.
The octagonal shape is a killer feature, I keep the clock angled 45° (as in the photo) and it really is the perfect angle for reading it while lying down.</p>
<p>One thing I’d like to improve in the future is to add a battery, because right now it’s solely USB powered and will obviously die if there’s a power outage. Adding a small LiPo battery and a charger circuit will be pretty easy and will ensure that the clock can keep running for hours even without power.</p>

<p>It’s not very complete, so use it at your own risk, and I haven’t really added deployment details, but it should be very easy to build with one PlatformIO command.</p>

							<p><em>TLDR: DuckDB now has full-text search functionality, similar to the FTS5 extension in SQLite. The main difference is that our FTS extension is fully formulated in SQL. We tested it out on TREC disks 4 and 5.</em></p>

<p>Searching through textual data stored in a database can be cumbersome, as SQL does not provide a good way of formulating questions such as “Give me all the documents about <strong>Mallard Ducks</strong>”: string patterns with <code>LIKE</code> will only get you so far. Despite SQL’s shortcomings here, storing textual data in a database is commonplace. Consider the table <code>products (id INT, name VARCHAR, description VARCHAR</code>) - it would be useful to search through the <code>name</code> and <code>description</code> columns for a website that sells these products.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>We expect a search engine to return us results within milliseconds. For a long time databases were unsuitable for this task, because they could not search large inverted indices at this speed: transactional database systems are not made for this use case. However, analytical database systems, can keep up with state-of-the art information retrieval systems. The company <a href="https://www.spinque.com/">Spinque</a> is a good example of this. At Spinque, MonetDB is used as a computation engine for customized search engines.</p>

<p>DuckDB’s FTS implementation follows the paper “<a href="https://hannes.muehleisen.org/SIGIR2014-column-stores-ir-prototyping.pdf">Old Dogs Are Great at New Tricks</a>”. A keen observation there is that advances made to the database system, such as parallelization, will speed up your search engine “for free”!</p>

<p>Alright, enough about the “why”, let’s get to the “how”.</p>

<h3 id="preparing-the-data">Preparing the Data</h3>
<p>The TREC 2004 Robust Retrieval Track has 250 “topics” (search queries) over TREC disks 4 and 5. The data consist of many text files stored in SGML format, along with a corresponding DTD (document type definition) file. This format is rarely used anymore, but it is similar to XML. We will use OpenSP’s command line tool <code>osx</code> to convert it to XML. Because there are many files, I wrote a bash script:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> latimes/xml
<span>for </span>i <span>in</span> <span>$(</span><span>seq</span> <span>-w</span> 1 9<span>)</span>
<span>do
        </span><span>cat </span>dtds/la.dtd latimes-<span>$i</span> | osx <span>&gt;</span> latimes/xml/latimes-<span>$i</span>.xml
<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This sorts the <code>latimes</code> files. Repeat for the <code>fbis</code>, <code>cr</code>, <code>fr94</code>, and <code>ft</code> files.</p>

<p>To parse the XML I used BeautifulSoup. Each document has a <code>docno</code> identifier, and a <code>text</code> field. Because the documents do not come from the same source, they differ in what other fields they have. I chose to take all of the fields.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>duckdb</span>
<span>import</span> <span>multiprocessing</span>
<span>import</span> <span>pandas</span> <span>as</span> <span>pd</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that we have a dataframe, we can register it in DuckDB.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># create database connection and register the dataframe
</span><span>con</span> <span>=</span> <span>duckdb</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>database</span><span>=</span><span>'db/trec04_05.db'</span><span>,</span> <span>read_only</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span>

<span># create a table from the dataframe so that it persists
</span><span>con</span><span>.</span><span>execute</span><span>(</span><span>"CREATE TABLE documents AS (SELECT * FROM documents_df)"</span><span>)</span>
<span>con</span><span>.</span><span>close</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This is the end of my preparation script, so I closed the database connection.</p>

<h3 id="building-the-search-engine">Building the Search Engine</h3>
<p>We can now build the inverted index and the retrieval model using a <code>PRAGMA</code> statement. The extension is <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/full_text_search">documented here</a>. We create an index table on table <code>documents</code> or <code>main.documents</code> that we created with our script. The column that identifies our documents is called <code>docno</code>, and we wish to create an inverted index on the fields supplied. I supplied all fields by using the ‘*’ shortcut.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>con</span> <span>=</span> <span>duckdb</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>database</span><span>=</span><span>'db/trec04_05.db'</span><span>,</span> <span>read_only</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span>
<span>con</span><span>.</span><span>execute</span><span>(</span><span>"PRAGMA create_fts_index('documents', 'docno', '*', stopwords='english')"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Under the hood, a parameterized SQL script is called. The schema <code>fts_main_documents</code> is created, along with tables <code>docs</code>, <code>terms</code>, <code>dict</code>, and <code>stats</code>, that make up the inverted index. If you’re curious what this look like, take a look at our source code under the <code>extension</code> folder in DuckDB’s source code!</p>

<h3 id="running-the-benchmark">Running the Benchmark</h3>
<p>The data is now fully prepared. Now we want to run the queries in the benchmark, one by one. We load the topics file as follows:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># the 'topics' file is not structured nicely, therefore we need parse some of it using regex

<p>This gives us a dictionary that has query number as keys, and query strings as values, e.g. <code>301 -&gt; 'International Organized Crime'</code>.</p>

<p>We want to store the results in a specific format, so that they can be evaluated by <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/trec_eval.git">trec eval</a>:</p>

map                     all 0.2324
P_30                    all 0.2948
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Not bad! While these results are not as high as the reproducible by <a href="https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/regressions-robust04.md">Anserini</a>, they are definitely acceptable. The difference in performance can be explained by differences in</p>
<ol>
  <li>Which stemmer was used (we used ‘porter’)</li>
  <li>Which stopwords were used (we used the list of 571 English stopwords used in the SMART system)</li>
  <li>Pre-processing (removal of accents, punctuation, numbers)</li>
  <li>BM25 parameters (we used the default k=1.2 and b=0.75, non-conjunctive)</li>
  <li>Which fields were indexed (we used all columns by supplying ‘*’)</li>
</ol>

<p>Retrieval time for each query was between 0.5 and 1.3 seconds on our machine, which will be improved with further improvements to DuckDB. I hope you enjoyed reading this blog, and become inspired to test out the extension as well!</p>

							<p>Today, the Norwegian Data Protection Authority issued an advance notification of a 100 million NOK (€ 9 600 000) fine to the dating app Grindr, as a result of a legal complaint filed by the Norwegian Consumer Council. </p><p>- This is a milestone in the ongoing work to ensure that consumers’ privacy is protected online. The Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) has clearly established that it is unacceptable for companies to collect and share personal data without user´s permission, Finn Myrstad, director of digital policy in the Norwegian Consumer Council said.</p>
<p>In 2020, the Norwegian Consumer Council <a href="https://www.forbrukerradet.no/side/new-study-the-advertising-industry-is-systematically-breaking-the-law/">revealed how many apps collect and share large amounts of sensitive information</a> without users’ knowledge. Based on these findings, the Consumer Council filed legal complaints, together with&nbsp;noyb, the European Center for Digital Right,&nbsp;against the dating app Grindr and five commercial partners for breaches of the&nbsp;General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>The Data Protection Authority has now upheld the Consumer Council’s&nbsp;complaint&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.datatilsynet.no/en/news/2021/intention-to-issue--10-million-fine-to-grindr-llc/">issued an advance notification of a 100 million NOK&nbsp;</a>(€ 9 600 000)&nbsp;one-time&nbsp;administrative&nbsp;fine, which amounts to 10 percent of Grindr’s global annual revenue.&nbsp;Grindr has until February 15th&nbsp;to provide comments or remarks&nbsp;on the decision.</p>

<p>-  This is excellent news and sends a clear signal that it’s illegal to monitor consumers without their consent 24/7 to collect and share their data. The GDPR does have teeth and consumer groups stand ready to act against those who break the law, Monique Goyens, Director General of The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC), said.</p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">– The message is simple: ‘take it or leave it’ is not consent. If you rely on unlawful ‘consent’ you are subject to a hefty fine.

<p>- Our preliminary conclusion is that Grindr has shared user data to a number of third parties without legal basis, said Bjørn Erik Thon, Director-General of the Norwegian Data Protection Authority.</p>
<p>Grindr is a location-based social networking app for gay, bi, trans, and queer people. In 2020, <a href="https://www.forbrukerradet.no/side/complaints-against-grindr-and-five-third-party-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Norwegian Consumer Council filed a complaint against Grindr</a> claiming unlawful sharing of personal data with third parties for marketing purposes. The data shared include GPS location, user profile data, and the fact that the user in question is on Grindr.</p>
<p>Our preliminary conclusion is that Grindr needs consent to share these personal data and that Grindr’s consents were not valid. Additionally, we believe that the fact that someone is a Grindr user speaks to their sexual orientation, and therefore this constitutes special category data that merit particular protection.</p>
<p>- The Norwegian Data Protection Authority considers that this is a serious case. Users were not able to exercise real and effective control over the sharing of their data. Business models where users are pressured into giving consent, and where they are not properly informed about what they are consenting to, are not compliant with the law, said Bjørn Erik Thon, Director-General of the Norwegian Data Protection Authority.</p>
<h2>Invalid consents</h2>
<p>The Norwegian Data Protection Authority considers that as a general rule, consent is required for intrusive profiling and tracking practices for marketing or advertising purposes, for example those that involve tracking individuals across multiple websites, locations, devices, services or data-brokering. The same applies where a commercial app wishes to share data concerning users’ sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Users were forced to accept the privacy policy in its entirety to use the app, and they were not asked specifically if they wanted to consent to the sharing of their data with third parties. Furthermore, the information about the sharing of personal data was not properly communicated to users. We consider that this was contrary to the GDPR requirements for valid consent.</p>
<p>- Grindr is seen as a safe space, and many users wish to be discrete. Nonetheless, their data have been shared with an unknown number of third parties, and any information regarding this was hidden away, Thon added.</p>
<h2>Could result in highest Norwegian DPA fine to date</h2>
<p>An administrative fine should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.</p>
<p>- We have notified Grindr that we intend to impose a fine of high magnitude as our findings suggest grave violations of the GDPR. Grindr has 13.7 million active users, of which thousands reside in Norway. Our view is that these people have had their personal data shared unlawfully. An important objective of the GDPR is precisely to prevent <em>take-it-or-leave-it</em> “consents”. It is imperative that such practices cease, Thon emphasised.</p>
<p>We have found that Grindr has a worldwide annual turnover of at least USD $ 100&nbsp;000&nbsp;000. This means that our proposed fine will constitute approximately 10 % of the company’s turnover.</p>
<p>Our investigation has focused on the consent mechanism in place from the GDPR became applicable until April 2020, when Grindr changed how the app asks for consent. We have not to date assessed whether the subsequent changes comply with the GDPR.</p>
<h2>Not a final decision</h2>
<p>The document we have issued to Grindr is a draft decision. Grindr has been given the opportunity to comment on our findings within 15 February 2021. We will make our final decision once we have assessed any remarks the company may have.</p>
<p>Our draft decision concerns the free version of the Grindr app.</p>
<p>The Norwegian Consumer Council also filed complaints against five of the third parties receiving data from Grindr: MoPub (owned by Twitter Inc.), Xandr Inc. (formerly known as AppNexus Inc.), OpenX Software Ltd., AdColony Inc., and Smaato Inc. These cases are ongoing.</p>

Those wouldn't have necessarily prevented them from getting a vaccine as there are many out-of-territory workers in the North.</p>  <p>But he said the territory has obtained sample copies of all other provincial and territorial health care cards to be kept with the mobile vaccine units so the units can determine&nbsp;if a health card is valid,&nbsp;"in case someone's trying to fake that."</p>  <p>The Yukon government is also working on ways to find supporting evidence that someone is actually employed in the territory.</p>  <p>"All that is being sorted out by the team right now to try and figure out how to keep everybody safe," Streicker said.</p>    <p>He said the incident was shocking, but said officials&nbsp;don't think it will happen again.</p>  <p>"We just didn't anticipate that anyone would go to this length to effectively deceive the team to get vaccinated, and I think we all felt pretty offended at the whole thing," Streicker said.</p>  <p>"But we will put in place additional procedures …&nbsp;I don't imagine that this is going to repeat itself."</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p>This site features a curriculum developed around the television series, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;q=halt+and+catch+fire">Halt and Catch Fire</a> (2014-2017), a fictional narrative about people working in tech during the 1980s-1990s.</p>

<p>The intent is for this website to be used by self-forming small groups that want to create a “watching club” (like a book club) and discuss aspects of technology history that are featured in this series.</p>

<p>There are 15 classes, for a “semester-long” course:<br>

A <strong>Platformer</strong> investigation has found:</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Signal appears to have more than 40 million users, up from approximately 20 million last month</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The company is actively developing features related to user names and cryptocurrency payments, potentially creating new avenues for abuse</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>At least one employee quit Signal in recent weeks over concerns that the 6-year-old company does not have a content policy and has resisted developing one</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton has become heavily involved in daily operations, interviewing engineers and writing code</strong> </p></li><li><p><strong>CEO Moxie Marlinspike tells Platformer: “The thing about software is that you never can fully anticipate everything. We just have to be willing to iterate.”</strong></p></li></ul><p>On January 6th, WhatsApp users around the world began seeing a pop-up message notifying them of upcoming changes to the service’s privacy policy. The changes were designed to enable businesses to send and store messages to WhatsApp’s 2 billion-plus users, but they came with an ultimatum: agree by February 8th, or you can no longer use the app.</p><p>The resulting furor sparked a backlash that led Facebook-owned WhatsApp to delay the policy from taking effect until May. In the meantime, though, tens of millions of users began seeking alternatives to Facebook’s suite of products. Among the biggest beneficiaries has been Signal, the encrypted messaging app whose development is funded by a nonprofit organization. Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">according to one research firm</a>, the six-year-old app had about 20 million users worldwide. But in a 12-hour period the Sunday after WhatsApp’s privacy policy update began, Signal added another 2 million users, an employee familiar with the matter told me. Days of temporary outages followed.</p><p>The pace has hardly relented since. Signal leapt to No. 1 in the app stores of 70 countries, and it continues to rank near the top of most of them, including the United States. While the company won’t confirm the size of its user base, a second employee told me the app has now surpassed 40 million users globally. And while Signal still has a small fraction of the market for mobile messaging — Telegram, another upstart messenger, <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1352368555711365121">says it added 90 million active users in January alone</a> —&nbsp;the rapid growth has been a cause for excitement inside the small distributed team that makes the app.</p><p>Adding millions of users has served as a vindication for a company that has sought to build a healthier internet by adopting different incentives than most Silicon Valley companies.</p><p>“We're organized as a nonprofit because we feel like the way the internet currently works is insane,” CEO Moxie Marlinspike told me. “And a lot of that insanity, to us, is the result of bad business models that produce bad technology. And they have bad societal outcomes.” Signal’s mission, by contrast, is to promote privacy through end-to-end encryption, without any commercial motive.</p><p>But Signal’s rapid growth has also been a cause for concern. In the months leading up to and following the 2020 US presidential election, Signal employees raised questions about the development and addition of new features that they fear will lead the platform to be used in dangerous and even harmful ways. But those warnings have largely gone unheeded, they told me, as the company has pursued a goal to hit 100 million active users and generate enough donations to secure Signal’s long-term future.</p><p>Employees worry that, should Signal fail to build policies and enforcement mechanisms to identify and remove bad actors, the fallout could bring more negative attention to encryption technologies from regulators at a time when their existence is threatened around the world.</p><p>“The world needs products like Signal — but they also need Signal to be thoughtful,” said Gregg Bernstein, a former user researcher who left the organization this month over his concerns. “It’s not only that Signal doesn’t have these policies in place. But they’ve been resistant to even considering what a policy might look like.”</p><p>Interviews with current and former employees, plus leaked screenshots of internal deliberations, paint a portrait of a company that is justly proud of its role in promoting privacy while also willfully dismissing concerns over the potential misuses of its service. Their comments raise the question of whether a company conceived as a rebuke to data-hungry, ad-funded communication tools like Facebook and WhatsApp will really be so different after all.</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>Like a lot of problems, this one started with an imperative familiar to most businesses: growth.</p><p>Encrypted messaging has been a boon to activists, dissidents, journalists, and marginalized groups around the world. Not even Signal itself can see their messages —&nbsp;much less law enforcement or national security agencies. The app saw a surge in usage during last year’s protests for racial justice, even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280112/signal-face-blurring-tool-ios-android-update">adding a tool to automatically blur faces</a> in photos to help activists more safely share images of the demonstrations. This kind of growth, one that supported progressive causes, was exciting to Signal’s roughly 30-member team.</p><p>“That's the kind of use case that we really want to support,” Marlinspike told me. “People who want more control over their data and how it's used — and who want to exist outside the gaze of tech companies.”</p><p>On October 28th, <a href="https://signal.org/blog/group-links/">Signal added group links</a>, a feature that has become increasingly common to messaging apps. With a couple of taps, users could begin creating links that would allow anyone to join a chat in a group as large as 1,000 people. And because the app uses end-to-end encryption, Signal itself would have no record of the group’s title, its members, or the image the group chose as its avatar. At the same time, the links make it easy for activists to recruit large numbers of people onto Signal simultaneously, with just a few taps.</p><p>But as the US presidential election grew closer, some Signal employees began raising concerns that group links could be abused. On September 29th, during a debate, President Trump had told the far-right extremist group the Proud Boys to “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-race-and-ethnicity-donald-trump-chris-wallace-0b32339da25fbc9e8b7c7c7066a1db0f">stand back and stand by</a>.” During an all-hands meeting, an employee asked Marlinspike how the company would respond if a member of the Proud Boys or another extremist organization posted a Signal group chat link publicly in an effort to recruit members and coordinate violence.</p><p>“The response was: if and when people start abusing Signal or doing things that we think are terrible, we'll say something,” said Bernstein, who was in the meeting, conducted over video chat. “But until something is a reality, Moxie's position is he's not going to deal with it.”</p><p>Bernstein (disclosure: a former colleague of mine at Vox Media), added, “You could see a lot of jaws dropping. That’s not a strategy —&nbsp;that’s just hoping things don’t go bad.”&nbsp;</p><p>Marlinspike’s response, he told me in a conversation last week, was rooted in the idea that because Signal employees cannot see the content on their network, the app does not need a robust content policy. Like almost all apps, its terms of service state that the product cannot be used to violate the law. Beyond that, though, the company has sought to take a hands-off approach to moderation.</p><p>“We think a lot on the product side about what it is that we're building, how it's used, and the kind of behaviors that we're trying to incentivize,” Marlinspike told me. “The overriding theme there is that we don't want to be a media company. We’re not algorithmically amplifying content. We don’t have access to the content. And even within the app, there are not a lot of opportunities for amplification.”</p><p>At the same time, employees said, Signal is developing multiple tools simultaneously that could be ripe for abuse. For years, the company has faced complaints that its requirement that people use real phone numbers to create accounts <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9kaxge/how-to-use-signal-without-giving-out-your-phone-number-a-gendered-security-issue">raises privacy and security concerns</a>. And so Signal has begun working on an alternative: letting people create unique usernames. But usernames (and display names, should the company add those, too) could enable people to impersonate others — a scenario the company has not developed a plan to address, despite completing much of the engineering work necessary for the project to launch.</p><p>Signal has also been actively exploring the addition of payments into the app. Internally, this has been presented as a way to help people in developing nations transfer funds more easily. But other messaging apps, including Facebook and China’s WeChat, have pursued payments as a growth strategy.</p><p>An effort from Facebook to develop a cryptocurrency, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/facebook-rebrands-libra-wallet-service-calibra-to-novi/#:~:text=Today%2C%20Facebook%20announced%20that%20Calibra%20has%20a%20new%20name%2C%20Novi.&amp;text=The%20Libra%20blockchain%20is%20supposed,%E2%80%9Cvia%E2%80%9D%20(way).">now known as Novi</a>, has been <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2019/11/05/libras-regulatory-hurdles-appear-taller-after-house-hearing/">repeatedly derailed</a> by skeptical regulators.</p><p>Marlinspike has served as an adviser to MobileCoin, a cryptocurrency built on the Stellar blockchain designed to make payments simple and secure —&nbsp;and, potentially, impossible to trace. “The idea of MobileCoin is to build a system that hides everything from everyone,” <em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/">Wired</a></em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/"> wrote of the project in 2017</a>. “These components make MobileCoin more resistant to surveillance, whether it's coming from a government or a criminal.”</p><p>People I spoke with told me they regard the company’s exploration of cryptocurrency as risky since it could invite more bad actors onto the platform and attract regulatory scrutiny from world leaders.&nbsp;</p><p>Marlinspike played down the potential of crypto payments in Signal, saying only that the company had done some “design explorations” around the idea. But significant engineering resources have been devoted to developing MobileCoin integrations in recent quarters, former employees said.&nbsp;</p><p>“If we did decide we wanted to put payments into Signal, we would try to think really carefully about how we did that,” Marlinspike said. “It’s hard to be totally hypothetical.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>III.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Signal’s growth imperatives are driven in part by its unusual corporate structure. The app is funded by the Signal Foundation, which was created in 2018 with a $50 million loan from WhatsApp co-founder …</p></div></div>

    <p>Over the past several weeks, GameStop stock has traded more like a cryptocurrency than a failing mall-based retailer.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/gme.png" alt="GameStop"></p>

<p>What is going on here?</p>

<p>In one sentence: Institutional investors short GameStop (i.e., the prevailing wisdom, at least until the past few weeks) are playing a game of chicken with retail investors &amp; contrarian institutions who are long. [1]</p>

<h3 id="the-current-situation">The Current Situation</h3>

<p>GameStop is a video game retailer; it has been in decline for several years now. Video games have moved to an online, direct-to-consumer distribution model. Foot traffic in malls (where most GameStops are located) was down even before COVID; many mall-based retailers are struggling.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, over the course of 2020 this led to GameStop becoming one of the <a href="https://www.highshortinterest.com/">most shorted stocks</a> on Wall Street.</p>

<p>However, there were early signs that GameStop was undervalued. Michael Burry (of <em>The Big Short</em> fame) <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-michael-burry-big-short-stock-next-gen-discs-2019-8">took a large long position in 2019</a>, claiming video game discs are not entirely dead. In August 2020, Roaring Kitty (a.k.a. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DeepFuckingValue/">u/DeepFuckingValue</a> on Reddit) published a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alntJzg0Um4">video</a> detailing why GameStop was a good play based on its fundamentals – a future short squeeze would just be the icing on the cake.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/michael_burry.jpg" alt="Michael Burry"></p>
<p>Christian Bale playing Michael Burry</p>

<p>On January 11th, Ryan Cohen (founder of <a href="https://www.chewy.com/">Chewy</a>, which sold to PetSmart for $3.35 billion), <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chewy-co-founder-joins-gamestops-board-after-pushing-overhaul-11610378574">joined GameStop’s board</a> after his investment firm built up a 10% stake in the company. At this point, retail investors, especially those on the popular subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">Wall Street Bets</a> went crazy. They highlighted that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/">GameStop was now a growth play</a>. It is now led by a previously successful founder, its online business is growing at a 300% rate, and it is in the process of turning around its core business. [2] As such, GameStop should be valued at a Venture Capital multiple of 10x+ revenue, rather than a measly 0.5x revenue.</p>

<p>This narrative is compelling. Despite short sellers warning otherwise, GameStop has continued to climb in price. All of the GameStop options issued (with a high strike price of $60) were in the money on Friday (1/22/2021), trigging a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2txra/that_was_a_margin_call/gk87z17/">gamma squeeze</a> as institutions who had written the options rushed to cover their positions. GameStop closed Friday at $65.01.</p>

<p>On Monday (1/25/2021), GameStop opened at $96.73, spiked at $159.18 (likely because of another gamma squeeze), [3] then crashed with pressure from institutional shorts, closing at $76.79 (still up 18% day-over-day).</p>

<p>But the bulls aren’t finished with GameStop. These gamma squeezes are nothing compared to what will be coming: the near-mythical “Infinity Squeeze”. Most famously seen with <a href="https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/">Volkswagen in 2008</a>, when short sellers are forced to cover their positions due to a margin call, the price of the stock rapidly rises (hypothetically to infinity) since the number of shares shorted exceeds the number of shares available to buy.</p>

<h3 id="the-allure-of-wall-street-bets">The Allure of Wall Street Bets</h3>

<p>Can a subreddit comprised of retail investors really move the market like this? I doubt it – all of the big swings in this stock have been caused by institutions. What this subreddit does is <strong>control the narrative</strong>.</p>

<p>First unveiled to the mainstream finance world in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/reddit-s-profane-greedy-traders-are-shaking-up-the-stock-market">February 2020 Bloomberg article</a>, Wall Street Bets is profane (as I’m sure you’ve noticed if you clicked any of the links in this post). But Wall Street Bets isn’t some sinister, market-manipulating entity. Rather, it is a virtual water cooler for individual retail investors to post memes – and emojis, oh so many emojis – about their investments.</p>

<p>Reading Wall Street Bets feels like the discussion at a middle school cafeteria table circa 2000. Redditors on Wall Street Bets (who refer to themselves affectionately as “autists” or “retards”) [4] encourage one another to have “diamond hands” (💎 🤲), the will to stay strong and not sell a stock when things are going poorly. Contrast this with the “paper hands” (🧻 🤲) of those who are weak-willed and sell a stock based on market sentiment. Companies are headed “to the moon” (🚀). Bears are not mentioned without the adjective “gay” (🌈 🐻). Self-deprecating cuckold references to “my wife’s boyfriend” abound.</p>

<p>Despite this language (or perhaps because of it), Wall Street Bets is one of the most entertaining and informative places on the internet. People post meaningful analysis of companies that are undervalued and why they are investing. Browsing the subreddit, you get a crash course on concepts that you would otherwise learn only at a buy-side firm or working as an options trader: EBITDA multiple, book value, delta hedging, implied volatility.</p>

<p>But the most compelling aspect of Wall Street Bets is in its name: the bets. The ability to gain (or lose) a life-changing amount of money – with screenshots to prove it – creates an environment similar to that of the casino floor. And if Wall Street Bets is the casino floor, then Wall Street itself is the house.</p>

<p>The same emotion that caused us to root for the thieves in <em>Ocean’s 11</em> is what makes Wall Street Bets so enticing. Put frankly, Millennials are tired of getting fucked by the man. When you’re underemployed with $100,000 in student loan debt, your financial situation feels overwhelming. You really don’t want to take the advice of your parents or CNBC talking heads [5] to invest 10% of your salary for a 4% annual return. At that point, what’s another $5,000? Might as well buy some short-dated GME calls.</p>

<p>For those of use who don’t fit the underemployed Millennial archetype, Matt Levine’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-04-30/if-you-re-bored-you-can-trade-stocks">Boredom Markets Hypothesis</a> applies. COVID has required us to work from home, without much ability to spend for travel, dining, or entertainment. Putting money into Robinhood is a decent substitute – with the added bonus of it being an “investment”, rather than consumption. In an age where the Fed will print seemingly unlimited money to prop up capital markets, better to be irrational exuberant as a part of the market than be left out of the party.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/money_printer.jpg" alt="money printer go brrrrr"></p>

<p>Further, the narrative presented by the GameStop trade in particular is compelling. It allows the small retail investor to play a role in market events normally only played out at the hedge fund scale (a short squeeze was a key plot element in Season 1 of <em>Billions</em>). The short sellers in this case aren’t particularly sympathetic: Andrew Left of <a href="https://citronresearch.com/">Citron Research</a> released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEi2axM4hwI">video</a> in which he lays out the bear case for GameStop. His main argument was a smug appeal to authority, essentially claiming “Wall Street knows better than you people on message boards”. [6]</p>

<p>So sure, Wall Street Bets is irreverent, has irrational exuberance, and is guilty of hero worship (Elon Musk and more recently Ryan Cohen). But it also provides a sense of community during the stresses of COVID and provides a compelling way for the little guy to stick it to the man.</p>

<p>As Keynes reminded us (in the most overused finance quote of all time): <em>“The markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.”</em> When enough people believe in a vision, it can cause that vision to manifest itself. <a href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/gamestop-and-the-dangerous-game-of-gamma-squeezes-15546125">Wall Street is scared</a> that retail investors can manifest their own vision, rather that the one dictated by the major financial players.</p>

<h3 id="what-george-soros-got-right">What George Soros Got Right</h3>

<p>The entire GameStop scenario is a case study in reflexivity. [7] Reflexivity is the idea that our perception of circumstances influences reality, which then further impacts our perception of reality, in a self-reinforcing loop. Specifically, in a financial market, prices are a reflection of traders’ expectations. Those prices then influence traders’ expectations, and so on.</p>

<p>This may seem obvious to some, but it flies in the face of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis">efficient-market hypothesis</a>. As Soros states,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What makes reflexivity interesting is that the prevailing bias has ways, via the market prices, to affect the so-called fundamentals that market prices are supposed to reflect. [8]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does this mean for GameStop? Because of traders’ bullish sentiment, a previously failing company is now in the position where it can leverage the overnight increase in value to make real, substantive changes to its business. GameStop can pay off debt through the issuance of new shares or make strategic acquisitions using its newly-valuable shares. [9] A struggling company could become solid simply not because of a change in the underlying business, but because investors <strong>decided it should be more valuable</strong>.</p>

<p>Reflexivity may be the best way to understand the 21st Century. <a href="https://emerging.substack.com/p/peak-reflexivity">Passive investing is an example of reflexivity in action</a>. [10] So is winner-take-all venture investing. Uber raised an absurd war chest, causing more investors to want to pile in, which led to more fundraising and eventually a successful IPO. The fact that Uber has not yet turned a profit, yet today has a $100 billion market cap, cannot be explained with traditional financial thinking, but can be explained by reflexivity.</p>

<p>The internet and instant communication only accelerates these trends. Instances of reflexivity like the strange market movements we’ve seen with GameStop are happening more and more – not only in financial markets, but also in the political and social realm, to incredible effect.</p>

<p>When Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016, I distinctly remember writing in my journal: <em>“Anything is possible.”</em> I was blown away that this complete buffoon of a man, someone who the Huffington Post <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-note-about-our-coverage-of-donald-trumps-campaign_n_55a8fc9ce4b0896514d0fd66">refused to cover as politics</a> meme-d his way into the presidency. He was a joke, until suddenly, in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulpa">Tulpa-esque</a> twist…he wasn’t. Similarly, internet conspiracy theories spread via Facebook memes manifested themselves in the real world when Trump supporters <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol">stormed the Capitol</a> a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>Our perception shapes reality. And when enough people agree on a specific perception, it becomes reality. [11] As we become more and more connected, discourse will expand and and accelerate. We’re going to see some strange things become reality.</p>

<p>Even, perhaps, hedge funds going bankrupt and newly-minted …</p></div></div>

January 25, 2021 | https://www.weskao.com/blog/how-to-instantly-show-your-value | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.weskao.com/blog/how-to-instantly-show-your-value">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-f7b3cf53449abc80ad4f"><div><p>Happy new year from Toronto!</p><p>I’ve compiled my favorite ways to convey your product’s value prop. These apply to products and brands, but feel free to apply this to people too. These work for job interviews, selling yourself as a consultant, etc.</p><p><strong>Use before-and-after</strong>: <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/comparisons-heighten-drama" target="_blank">Everyone loves a good before-and-after contrast</a>. Before-and-afters are a powerful application of the idea of “show not tell.” That’s why you see so many before-and-afters when scrolling through your feed: weight loss (not-your-best self vs toned/healthy), home renovation (dingy bathroom vs shiny new renovation), messaging copy (bad writing vs strong writing), etc. A before-and-after is like a jump cut that skips all the boring parts--it emphasizes contrast, which heightens drama and interest. When talking about yourself, show what a project was like before you arrived and what it looked like after your contributions.</p><p><strong>Show, not tell</strong>: I recently came across AI-driven software that reduces background noise on calls. The thing that caught my eye on their homepage is the toggle “on” and “off” button where you can hear a sound sample without their tool versus how much sharper the sound is with their tool. It was pretty incredible and instantly sold me. As a marketer, I’m always on the lookout for <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/case-study-dissecting-an-everyday-story" target="_blank">when I change my mind</a>. It’s hard to change people’s minds, so when it happens successfully, try to learn what worked. Think of how you can demonstrate the value of your product like this.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610079443099_26862"><div><p><strong>Experiential, temporal, sensory</strong>: It’s hard for most brands to describe your product’s value quickly. It’s especially hard if your product has an experiential, temporal, or sensory component.&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><em>Experiential</em>: How do you convey a sense of community and belonging? The altMBA had this challenge. In-person courses had websites that showed photos of participants drawing on post-its and pointing at white boards. But our course was entirely online. Photos of people sitting at a computer would hardly do justice. We ended up using screenshots of Zoom gallery view among other things. Not perfect, but we chose to rely less on photography and more on other design elements given this constraint.</p></li><li><p><em>Temporal</em>: How do you convey the value of your product if it lasts 10x longer than competitors who are selling for cheaper? How do you convey the value or benefit of your product if there’s no immediate benefit in a world that loves instant gratification? Think of examples of products you’ve purchased where there’s less immediate value but more long-term value, and how the value prop was positioned.</p></li><li><p><em>Sensory</em>: How do you convey smell through a computer screen? How do you convey how good your weighted blanket feels? To solve this, consumer products will focus more on the emotion, less on the product features. For body wash, the brand doesn’t talk about how the sulfates will get you clean, how it smells, and the ounces of product you get. They talk about taking a moment for yourself.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Don’t worry about correct grammar</strong>. Go ahead and break grammar rules. The only thing that matters is that your customer takes action and you build trust in the process. I add that last part about building trust because you want to aim for conversion, but not destroy your brand equity in the process. It’s a delicate balance per the <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/brand-marketing-vs-performance-marketing" target="_blank">Brand vs Performance Marketing Spectrum</a>.</p><p><strong>Increase desire, don’t just decrease friction</strong>: People jump through hoops for things they want. Did you pick your spouse because they were the most convenient option? No, you picked them despite needing to overcome obstacles. We tend to focus on removing friction because it feels comfortable and there’s a checklist of ways to do it. There’s less of a formula for <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/increasing-desire-vs-decreasing-friction" target="_blank">increasing desire</a>--which makes it all the more worthwhile because there’s upside potential that fewer people attempt to tap into.</p><p><strong>Be/Have/Do</strong>: This is one of my favorite frameworks for showing transformation. You want to show how your product helps a brand transform. What does your product let your customer be that they weren’t before? What do customers have that they didn’t have before? What can they do now that they couldn’t do before? This is a good exercise to focus your value proposition and generate talking points for business development, sales, and marketing copy.</p><p><strong>Aim for “No brainer status”</strong>: You need to aim for an instant yes. Not a yes after a hundred hours of nurturing. Think about what features, benefits, and value would make this an instant yes for your prospective customers. By the way, even if you think it’s an instant yes, you’ll still need to work at getting the yes. <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/everything-takes-longer-than-you-think-so-plan-accordingly" target="_blank">Everything takes longer than you think</a>. The reason to aim for a no brainer status is because this is like a rubber band. We’re stretching it, but it will snap back a bit.</p><p><strong>Do what makes their eyes light up (ELU)</strong>: You should have your pitch ready, but <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/eyes-light-up-elu" target="_blank">watch out for what makes people’s eyes light up</a>. What makes them lean in? You can tell when someone doesn’t really care about what you’re saying. Then there are moments when suddenly a spark of aliveness flashes in their eyes because you just said something they care about. Watch for ELU.</p><p><strong>Avoid backstory scope creep</strong>: This applies to showing your value via email, pitches, or conversations. Remove the 90% of stuff that’s only moderately relevant, and be ruthlessly focused on the 10% that’s most relevant to your audience. Talking about your camping trip? <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/start-right-before-you-get-eaten-by-the-bear" target="_blank">Start right before you almost get eaten by a bear</a>. Not a detailed agenda of the days leading up to arriving at camp.</p><p><strong>Consider overhauling and starting from scratch</strong>: If you’re struggling to describe your value, figure out <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/how-to-fix-limbo-copywriting" target="_blank">if the problem is the marketing or the underlying idea</a>.</p><p><strong>Focus on what your customer wants to hear about, not what you want to talk about</strong>: This is an easy way to figure out what to trim from your talking points. You think, “I have so much to talk about. Where do I start??” Start by asking yourself what would change your audience’s behavior for the better. I call this principle <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/strategy-not-self-expression" target="_blank">Strategy, Not Self-Expression</a>.</p><p><strong>Choose the right heuristics and design to appeal to people like us</strong>: Upon landing on a site, most customers are judging you within a few seconds. “People like us” refers to whatever group you might identify with. For example, people like us could be thoughtful, design-conscious knowledge workers at tech startups.</p><p>What’s a product that instantly sold you? I’m curious and would love to know…</p></div></div></div>]]>

                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/FictionalFlag.jpg">Did you ever want to live in your own country, to make your own rules? Tired of adjusting yourself to other people?&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>One solution is to buy a decommissioned cargo ship, and then strand it on a very shallow part of the sea, on international waters. You need really deep pockets and an adventurous spirit to succeed with this, but what an exciting adventure it would be!</p>
                    
                    <h2>Finding a ship</h2>
                    <p>The ship has to be large enough to become a small island where you can live permanently, and sustain yourself through growing of food. It also has to be large enough to not get turned over in a storm. This leaves us with large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_tanker" target="_blank">oil tankers</a>. They are flat bottomed, and have several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_the_oil_tanker" target="_blank">compartments</a> for the cargo which will make them more stable in rough seas.</p>
                    <p>To know the price of decommissioned ships we can look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_breaking" target="_blank">ship breaking yards</a>. In <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@22.4365831,91.7317171,15z" target="_blank">Chittagong, Bangladesh</a>, there is one of the biggest ship grave yards in the world, where they run the ships full speed onto the shore, and the locals are busy cutting them up into pieces and selling it as scrap metal.</p>
                    <p><i>Below: The coastline of Chittagong is lined with ships.</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ChittagongShipGraveyard.jpg"></p>
                    <p><i>Below: Zooming in you can see how the ships are being cut to pieces.</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ChittagongShipGraveyard2.jpg"></p>
                    <p>The scrap metal companies buy a medium size ship for around <a href="http://www.jimbojack.com/Countries/Bangladesh/Bangladesh_Chittagong_Ship-breaking_Yards.htm" target="_blank">$10 million</a>. Add to that the cost of sailing the ship to its final destination.</p>
                    <p>What remains is to contact shipping companies, and add yourself to the wait list of one of their vessels.</p>
                    <h2>Destination</h2>
                    <p>The challenge is to find a part of the ocean that is very shallow, but on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea" target="_blank">international waters</a>, which is 22 km (12 nautical miles) from the shoreline. To be safe, it should also be out of each country's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_economic_zone" target="_blank">exclusive economic zone</a>, which is 370 km from the shoreline.</p>
                    <p><i>Below: Waters (light blue) outside of any country's exclusive economic zone (dark blue).</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ExclusiveEconomicZones.jpg"></p>
                    <p>If possible it should be in a climate that makes farming easy, in a part of the world not afflicted by piracy, and in relatively calm waters.</p>
                    <p>How shallow does the ocean have to be? The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(hull)" target="_blank">draft</a> of a reasonably large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panamax" target="_blank">Panamax</a> class tanker is 10 to 15 m.</p>
                    <p>To find the shallow parts of the oceans, we can use <a href="https://www.google.com/earth/" target="_blank">Google Earth</a>&nbsp;to visualize data about seamounts (mountains in the oceans) from <a href="http://www.seaaroundus.org/" target="_blank">SeaAroundUs.org</a>, and then match this with the EEZ areas, as a user has done at the <a href="http://www.seasteading.org/forum-list/topic/natural-breakwaters-avoiding-waves-geography/" target="_blank">Seasteading.org</a> web site.</p>
                    <p>I have saved the data files here for future reference: <a href="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ExclusiveEconomicZones.kmz">ExclusiveEconomicZones.kmz</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/SeamountsUnder100m.kmz">SeamountsUnder100m.kmz</a>.</p>

                    <p>The Vitoria-Trinidade site looks like the easiest and safest option, and also the least afflicted by storms.</p>
                    <p>The ship could possibly be sailed slowly into position, and then sunken to rest on the ocean floor, by initially filling the tanks with water, and then replacing it with rocks sourced from the bottom.</p>
                    <p>But this requires the ocean floor to be reasonably flat, which might prove difficult, so a more realistic approach would be to anchor the ship using several huge anchors and long chains, and then filling up the bottom of the ship with ballast to make the ship behave well in storms.</p>
                    <p>On top of the deck you fill up with soil and plant trees and have various types food production. A Panamax ship has a deck of around 280 x 30 m, which is 8,400 m2, or the size of a soccer field.</p>
                    <p>Fresh water is made by desalination of sea water. Solar panels provide electricity. For housing the existing bunks of the ship is used.</p>
                    <p>Some obvious considerations include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Protection from intruders.</li>
                        <li>Having sustainable food production.</li>
                        <li>Protection from storms and high waves.</li>
                        <li>Hull maintenance, to save it from deteriorating in the saline water.</li>
                        <li>Carefully examining the site to look for geological problems (under water volcanoes, active fractures, etc).</li>
                    </ul>

<p>The War on Drugs is a massive failure. As neuroscientist and Columbia University Professor Dr. Carl Hart writes in his latest book, <em>Drug Use for Grown-Ups: Chasing Liberty in the Land of Fear</em>, “the American taxpayer spends approximately $35 billion each year fighting this war, yet the drugs in question remain as plentiful, if not more so, than they were in 1981, when the sum total of America’s annual drug-control budget was a mere $1.5 billion.” The difference now, Hart describes, is that today, tens of thousands of people are dying from drug-related overdoses—with opioids being the “primary culprit.” But it’s not that simple, when the “opioid crisis” in particular is, in reality, “a crisis of data collection and reporting.” In this account, Hart digs below the surface to re-evaluate the American relationship to drugs, while shedding light on his own personal relationship to drugs, as well. Both captivating and controversial, we caught up with Dr. Hart to talk about drugs and parenting, policy, addiction, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h-db-everyone-s-excited-about-your-new-book-what-s-one-thing-you-really-want-readers-to-glean-from-it"><span id="DB_Everyones_excited_about_your_new_book_Whats_one_thing_you_really_want_readers_to_glean_from_it">DB: Everyone’s excited about your new book. What’s one thing you really want readers to glean from it?&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>CH: The thesis of the book is very simple: It’s about liberty so long as you don’t disrupt other people’s ability to pursue their liberty. I want people to understand that liberty and the pursuit of happiness are protected in our founding document. It’s the core of being American.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h-in-the-book-you-re-very-open-about-your-own-drug-use-what-s-that-like-coming-out-of-the-drug-closet-as-a-professional-and-as-a-parent"><span id="In_the_book_youre_very_open_about_your_own_drug_use_Whats_that_like_coming_out_of_the_drug_closet_as_a_professional_and_as_a_parent"><strong>In the book, you’re very open about your own drug use. What’s that like, coming out of the drug closet, as a professional and as a parent?</strong></span></h2>
<p>That’s a big question I have to face and I still struggle with it. The most important point for me is that I live like the man that I claim to be, and that means that I have to think about how my children see me. They know that I take care of my responsibilities with them and that I care about our broader community. They see people suffering, being vilified, and persecuted for being labeled a drug user—and they know their father is standing up on behalf of those people, who have been cast away in society, and they feel good about it. As long as they feel good, I feel good. My primary concern is my family, and my children in particular.&nbsp;</p>

I think before he thought I would remember, my dad would sometimes smoke “herb” in front of me before I was old enough to register the observation. How do you handle this with your own kids?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2>

<p>My drug use is still personal and private. It’s like asking, “have your children seen you have sex?” I’m 54 years old, I’m not a child, and so I engage in grown-up behaviors in which my children will not observe me. I don’t observe them doing certain things, either. I only care about them being safe and taking care of themselves.</p>

At the same time, it’s a good opportunity to model a responsible, healthy relationship to drugs (be it heroin, cannabis, or even alcohol). How do you reconcile this with the query from those who might bring up the argument that trying drugs, like heroin, will automatically lead to addiction?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>There’s a lot in that question, so let’s unpack the first major point: How do you model responsible drug behavior? First of all, I don’t think of drug-taking behavior as abhorrent or unique. It’s just behavior. How do you model behavior? Well, what do responsible people do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>They keep their appointments, they make their obligations. And with drugs, you set aside time for that activity, and you know how long it takes for you to engage in that activity, and once it’s over, you carry out the other responsibilities you have. It’s not different from any other behavior—this is the big lie that’s so hard to undo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this notion that one hit and you’ll become addicted is nonsense: That point is always overstated. If a person is already irresponsible, then if they take heroin, they might also be irresponsible with their heroin use. How responsible a person is will tell how well they handle those other behaviors; it predicts how well they will do heroin or pay their bills. So their drug behavior, whether heroin or cannabis, is not unique from other behaviors.</p>

<p><strong><em>Read: <a href="https://doubleblindmag.com/end-the-war-on-drugs-psychedelics-drug-decriminalization/">Where Will Psychedelics and Other Drugs Be Decriminalized Next?</a></em></strong></p>

<h2 id="h-so-when-we-talk-about-drug-legalization-and-people-ask-what-about-the-addicts-what-do-you-say"><span id="So_when_we_talk_about_drug_legalization_and_people_ask-what_about_the_addicts-what_do_you_say">So when we talk about drug legalization and people ask—”what about the addicts?”—what do you say?</span></h2>

<p>In the U.S. and around the world, when we think about addiction, people tend to blame the drug—the substance, itself—for causing addiction, and that’s a limited and inaccurate approach. The majority of people who use any drug are not addicted: That tells you that you have to look beyond the drug with people who meet criteria for addiction. You’ll find that people who already have psychiatric disorders, or limited economic opportunities, are more likely to have the criteria for drug addiction. It’s not the drug that you have to focus on, but those other factors, regardless of whether they’re using the drug or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part of the problem with the drug discussion is that addition has hijacked the conversation, such that we only talk about drug addiction when talking about drug use. It’s like only talking about car crashes when we talk about automobiles. It’s ridiculous. So we have to change that, and that’s what I’m trying to do. If when we talk about drug use and we gave addiction proportional treatment of the topic, it wouldn’t be talked about that often. It’s a concern, but the reason people are addicted is not because of the drug.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>When we think about addiction, people tend to blame the drug—the substance, itself—for causing addiction, and that’s a limited and inaccurate approach. The majority of people who use any drug are not addicted: That tells you that you have to look beyond the drug.</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="h-so-if-the-majority-of-drug-users-are-not-problematic-drug-abusers-how-did-drug-use-and-abuse-get-conflated"><span id="So_if_the_majority_of_drug_users_are_not_problematic_drug_abusers_how_did_drug_use_and_abuse_get_conflated">So if the majority of drug users are not problematic drug “abusers,” how did drug use and abuse get conflated?</span></h2>
<p>When we think about the addiction narrative, the reason many of these substances are prohibited is American racism. One of the primary motivating factors behind alcohol prohibition was dislike of the Germans; remember this was around the time of World War I. When we think about cocaine, to vilify it, its negative effects were associated with Black people. When we wanted to vilify opioids, we paired it with the Chinese. All of this media hysteria was inaccurate—lies and misinformation. By connecting horrible acts with those groups and the drugs they used, the media reports and politicians gained standing. They oftentimes used white women as the object of their protections, so they were protecting white women and children from being corrupted with these drugs. Once they were corrupted, they would intermingle with those other racial groups—so they really tied the potential for addiction with these drugs, hoping to make people fearful of taking them in their quest to protect primarily white women. That’s how we have this connection.</p>

And how do we define drug abuse, versus drug use, to begin with?</span></h2>
<p>We define it as when people have certain symptoms in which they have disruptions in their functioning: They may not be meeting their occupational obligations, their family obligations, or other obligations. They may be actively trying to quit and having a hard time. They may experience some negative effects from their drug use, whether physiological or social, and they are disturbed by all these symptoms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They, themselves, must be disturbed by these symptoms. Such as, you may engage in behavior and your significant other may not like it, but you may not be troubled by the behavior or it may not actually be a problem. So the person, themself, must be distressed by these symptoms, too. The person’s own perspective is important.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our country, each of us are guaranteed life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We often think about those rights as guarantees in jingoistic terms, as opposed to unpacking how serious and noble those ideas are, and so I’m trying to remind people that everyone has those unalienable rights. That means they can’t be taken away from them, as long as they don’t disrupt other people’s ability to pursue their rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I had a relative who had a drug problem, I’d be hard pressed to find a place in the U.S. where I would send them—in large part because, too often, those places focus their energies on the drug itself, as opposed to those other psychosocial factors, such as whether that person has housing, health care, or gainful employment (that is, employment that would be appropriate for their age, education, ability to support a family, all those things). Does the person have other psychiatric illnesses or problems going on? All those factors are far more important than the drug itself. And too often the drug rehab centers focus on the drug itself and miss the boat.</p>

<p>For one, why are we missing the boat when we talk about opioids? We are getting it wrong because there is money in getting it wrong. There are grants now to deal with the so-called opioid crisis. This is an economic strategy, as opposed to making sure people have gainful employment. Police organizations get grants. NGOs get grants to deal with opioids. Coroners, medical examiners, everyone is getting money to deal with it. Everything they do, they see opioids because that’s where the spotlight is shining—if you’re looking for something, you’ll find it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-2fc7e2d4=""><p>We love <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. Individually, as an organization - we're just fans through and through.</p>
<p>As such we like to write with the Hacker News audience in mind.</p>
<p>In that regard we've met with a small - tiny, really (but very encouraging) - amount of success: The story of our form app has piqued the curiousity of some fellow bootstrappers as they follow us building and running a small SaaS business.</p>
<p>Here are our analytics numbers for each 3-month period this year  (2020) because for some reason GA restricts segment view windows to 93 days.</p>
<h2 id="january-4th---april-2nd">January 4th - April 2nd</h2>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/thirtyfive-thousand-01-01-2020-04-02-2020.png" alt="January 4th - April 2nd"></p>
<p>You can see our clear, breakaway winner here is our experience with the <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/our-experience-with-stripe-atlas">Stripe Atlas program</a>, a part blow-by-blow business accounting, part love letter to Stripe and this beautiful business-in-a-box tool it's made for small businesses like us. The other top pages are just runoff from the Stripe article, my poor <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/a-blog-in-five-functions">blog architecture</a> post barely scraping the top 10.</p>
<h2 id="april-3rd---july-4th">April 3rd - July 4th</h2>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/thirtyfive-thousand-04-03-2020-07-04-2020.png" alt="April 3rd - July 4th"></p>
<p>This period is a bit more mixed - Hacker News users love Tailwind (surprise!) and are interested in their <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/top-concerns-when-choosing-a-tech-stack-for-your-personal-website">personal stack</a> but otherwise the top pages are just a set of basic application workhorses indicating we're starting to get some more traction in everyday use.</p>
<h2 id="july-5th---october-5th">July 5th - October 5th</h2>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/thirtyfive-thousand-07-05-2020-10-05-2020.png" alt="July 5th - October 5th"></p>
<p>Once again our <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/how-an-email-got-us-five-thousand-aws-credits.png">latest experience with Stripe</a> proved a pretty interesting piece of content to the denizens of Hacker News, as enamored they are with Stripe, like all developers (including us!). This episode relies on the sending of a fateful email, but you can read through the whole thread for the full account.</p>
<h2 id="october-6th---december-31st">October 6th - December 31st</h2>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/thirtyfive-thousand-10-06-2020-12-31-2020.png" alt="October 6th - December 31st"></p>
<p><em>Whomp whomp</em>. You can see this period we did a fraction of our normal HN traffic, which happened because we made a big push to rollout our new file support system(!) (Check out the <a href="https://formcake.com/changelog">changelog</a> for other improvements) that pretty much sucked the life out of anything else (including new blog posts).</p>
<h2 id="the-full-view">The Full View</h2>
<p>So what does this year look like generally, outside of just HN users?</p>
<p>This is what the pageviews look like for all traffic:</p>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/thirtyfive-thousand-01-01-2020-12-31-2020-overview.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Admittedly, though it's interesting and I think useful in other ways to have information on application usage, let's segment it out in just this case to only show us the performance of <code>/blog</code> pages.</p>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/thirtyfive-thousand-01-01-2020-12-31-2020-overview-blog.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Our top three Stripe pieces account for the overwhelming amount of our traffic, at 84% of all unique pageviews.</p>
<p>Funny enough though, our next top contender, on the basis of strong organic traffic, is a simple, short-and-sweet technical article on a topic I found troublesome and surprisingly under-documented - <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/adding-a-single-page-to-hugo">adding a single page to a site powered by Hugo</a>, the static site generator.</p>
<h2 id="2021">2021</h2>
<p>Again, we <em>love</em> Hacker News. Getting anyone from HN to follow an accounting of our small business feels particularly validating.</p>
<p>We have big plans this year - for expanding the app, our online presence, and our internal processes. <a href="https://formcake.com/feed.xml">Subscribe to our RSS feed</a> or, sign-up to the email list below, or, you know, just check back sometime for more about it all!</p>

        <p>COVID-19 created circumstances where many businesses were forced to be flexible or shut down entirely. When no childcare or in-person school was available for workers during government-prompted shutdowns, most businesses knew better than to crack down harshly on parents who still had caregiving duties they couldn't avoid during the workday. Instead, many businesses created an unprecedented level of flexibility, allowing dual-income families, for instance, to shift what time of day or which days of the week when they completed their hours.</p><p>The strong recommendation that workers work from home when possible also changed how businesses viewed workplace flexibility. Rather than seeing work from home as a logistical barrier that they weren't willing to work around, they saw it as the best, most efficient way to keep workers safe while still creating value for the company.</p><p>Shorter work weeks have remained less common than the 5-day work week because of, among other things, distrust among leaders and worries about logistical hassle, despite strong research that many companies grow productivity and job satisfaction when they choose a four day work week. Here are some of the reasons why these hurdles were lowered by the experiences that businesses had in 2020.</p><h2 id="productivity-targets-covid-19-shutdowns-and-caregiving-responsibilities">Productivity Targets, COVID-19 Shutdowns, and Caregiving Responsibilities</h2><p>Not everyone thrived in the work-from-home, somewhat-more-flexible schedule of 2020, but many managers were impressed to discover that their team members were managing to efficiently allocate their work, get things done on time and up to standards, all while handling an impressive array of stressors in their personal lives or caregiving responsibilities for children. Companies who had previously assumed that giving team members greater autonomy and less time in the office total would tank productivity saw that they were wrong.</p><p>Even after schools are fully open and it becomes an expectation that team members will not have any caregiving duties during their work shifts, the lessons of this time period will linger with managers and other workplace leadership. The fact that having to get everything done in the time available was a powerful motivator is part of why research shows that workers with 4 day work weeks actually produce as much or more than their 5 day a week counterparts. When there are constraints on our time, we work smarter, not just harder, to get everything done.</p><h2 id="offering-flexibility-has-proven-its-track-record">Offering Flexibility Has Proven Its Track Record</h2><p>Some companies, realizing that the whole world was experiencing more health anxiety and isolation during COVID-19, made it their mission to remove barriers and make it easier for team members to get their work done. From making in-office work optional (to keep density of people working in the office low) to letting people log their hours any time as long as they got done each week, workplaces tried out unprecedented flexibility and got the chance to create a track record. Of course, managers had to modify their structures, figuring out how to do remote meetings well and making sure they knew if a team member was struggling, but in so many cases, the results were strong because team members were grateful for the flexibility. When we like a perk at work, we work hard to convince leadership to keep that perk. After COVID-19, workers everywhere will be able to point to their performance during a flexible work schedule and say, "see? I personally benefited and the company benefitted too."</p><h2 id="time-with-family-has-proven-valuable-to-many-workers">Time With Family Has Proven Valuable to Many Workers</h2><p>Shorter work weeks have also traditionally been rare partly because some workers say to themselves, "More time at home? What would I do with that?" Even very busy people have been so conditioned to assume that all day every day is for being at work. They couldn't imagine what a slower pace of life might look like.</p><p>Now, not everyone was happy to be at home with whoever they lived with during the pandemic. However, quite a lot of people came to the realization that spending time with roommates or family members slowed them down and reduced their stress. When workplaces were in a lull as the government made decisions about how to proceed, people noticed that they could focus on other things that mattered to them. Workers who previously didn't bat an eye at 50 or 60 hour work weeks may now see a shorter work week as a benefit they could enjoy and take advantage of in the futures.</p><p>As a result of this increased value for shorter work weeks, employers are more likely to see the logistical hurdles as worthwhile for the gains in employee retention and satisfaction.</p><h2 id="the-2020-experiment-prompts-further-experimentation">The 2020 Experiment Prompts Further Experimentation</h2><p>Not every company gave their teams flexibility specifically in the length of the workweek during 2020. Instead, they may have experimented with using more online tools, telecommuting for business meetings, or other strategies that created surprising savings while still allowing the job to get done. Companies whose 'new normal' includes some forms of workplace flexibility will have a harder time turning down other forms of experimentation going forward, especially with so much evidence that shorter work weeks are good for both the team members and the bottom line at the company.</p><p>Trying an experiment with shorter work weeks is likely to be met with enthusiasm among workers, especially when they are designed in a simple, elegant way that doesn't decrease customer experience or make life difficult for payroll or other parts of the company. When you handle issues of what to do when you have a question for someone on their day off and other small concerns, it's easier than you think to implement a pilot program and see what happens. Yes, there are companies that find that four day work weeks clash with their culture, but far more find that the motivation factor, the job satisfaction, and the resulting recruiting power are major benefits.</p><p>Whether 2021 brings more of the same challenges that 2020 brought or results in even more upheaval, companies that are willing to re-evaluate the status quo will be able to confront future challenges with better results.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>When doing image processing, rendering or converting between RGB color spaces, it is easy to end up with RGB values outside of the 0.0 to 1.0 range (or 0 to 255 for 8-bit colors). This normally means that it isn’t possible to encode the color and it needs to be adjusted somehow before being displayed or encoded (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ScRGB">scRGB</a> is an example of an exception, and has a different range). The range of supported colors in a color spaces is referred to as a its <em>gamut</em>.</p><p>Many of the colors outside the gamut are still valid colors, they just can’t be encoded in the given color space. The colors that can’t be encoded can be categorized as follows (for RGB color spaces without <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_color#Imaginary_colors">imaginary primaries</a>):</p><ul><li><strong>One or more RGB values are larger than one, but none are negative</strong><br>These colors are too bright for the color space, but could be encoded at a lower luminance.</li><li><strong>One or more negative values</strong><br>These color are more colorful than the color space is able to encode. Some of these can be real colors, but they can also be colors more colorful than physically possible. This is a consequence of linear encoding of colors, which is able to encode colors that can’t exist in real life.</li></ul><p>The simplest technique for dealing with colors outside the valid range is to simply clamp <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">R</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">G</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> individually. The simplicity of this makes the technique widespread, but unfortunately it has significant drawbacks and can lead to unpleasant color distortions.</p><p>Here is an example of taking a photo and increasing its exposure and colorfulness significantly, with results displayed as sRGB. Colorfulness has been increased by scaling <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/">Oklab</a> chroma. RGB values here are simply clamped to the 0.0 to 1.0 range.</p><br><div><p><a href="https://bottosson.github.io/img/gamutclipping/flowers/original.jpg"><img alt="Original" decoding="async" height="378" loading="lazy" src="https://bottosson.github.io/img/gamutclipping/flowers/original.jpg" width="504"></a><em>Unprocessed</em></p><p><a href="https://bottosson.github.io/img/gamutclipping/flowers/clipped_rgb.jpg"><img alt="Processed" decoding="async" height="378" loading="lazy" src="https://bottosson.github.io/img/gamutclipping/flowers/clipped_rgb.jpg" width="504"></a><em>Processed with out of range values clamped</em></p></div><p>This is of course problematic. Hues are heavily distorted and all the details in the flowers are gone. Better methods are needed. Thankfully, this problem isn’t new and has been researched a lot over the years.</p><p>Two main research topics exist:</p><blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_mapping">Tone mapping</a></strong>, which is concerned with mapping high dynamic range images to a lower dynamic range. This typically involves altering both colors inside and outside the gamut and sometimes involves different kinds of spatial filtering to keep details while reducing overall dynamic range.</p><p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_management#Gamut_mapping">Gamut mapping</a></strong>, which is concerned with mapping colors from one color space to another and dealing with the mismatch in what colors can be encoded. This can either be done using <em>gamut compression</em> or <em>gamut expansion</em>, which adjusts all colors of an image, or using <em>gamut clipping</em>, which leaves colors that exist in both color spaces intact, while mapping colors outside the gamut back in range. For an overview see the paper <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236121201_The_Fundamentals_of_Gamut_Mapping_A_Survey">“The Fundamentals of Gamut Mapping: A Survey”</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Tone mapping, gamut expansion and gamut compression are all useful techniques, but will not be the focus of this article. Instead we will limit the scope to creating a practical alternative to clipping sRGB values, by looking at gamut clipping in the sRGB color space and on relatively simple, robust and portable algorithms. The source code for the operations shown is also available, at the <a href="#source-code">end of the article</a>.</p><p>The techniques investigated are also, with some additional work, applicable to other color spaces, and some of the building blocks can be for other things, such as gamut compression. Combining gamut clipping with tone mapping can also be useful since some tone mapping techniques may still produce colors outside the target gamut.</p><h2 id="gamut-clipping">Gamut Clipping <a href="#gamut-clipping"><span><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" enable-background="new 0 0 512 512" version="1.1" xml:space="preserve" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M459.654,233.373l-90.531,90.5c-49.969,50-131.031,50-181,0c-7.875-7.844-14.031-16.688-19.438-25.813  l42.063-42.063c2-2.016,4.469-3.172,6.828-4.531c2.906,9.938,7.984,19.344,15.797,27.156c24.953,24.969,65.563,24.938,90.5,0  l90.5-90.5c24.969-24.969,24.969-65.563,0-90.516c-24.938-24.953-65.531-24.953-90.5,0l-32.188,32.219  c-26.109-10.172-54.25-12.906-81.641-8.891l68.578-68.578c50-49.984,131.031-49.984,181.031,0  C509.623,102.342,509.623,183.389,459.654,233.373z M220.326,382.186l-32.203,32.219c-24.953,24.938-65.563,24.938-90.516,0  c-24.953-24.969-24.953-65.563,0-90.531l90.516-90.5c24.969-24.969,65.547-24.969,90.5,0c7.797,7.797,12.875,17.203,15.813,27.125  c2.375-1.375,4.813-2.5,6.813-4.5l42.063-42.047c-5.375-9.156-11.563-17.969-19.438-25.828c-49.969-49.984-131.031-49.984-181.016,0  l-90.5,90.5c-49.984,50-49.984,131.031,0,181.031c49.984,49.969,131.031,49.969,181.016,0l68.594-68.594  C274.561,395.092,246.42,392.342,220.326,382.186z"></path></svg><span></span></span></a></h2><p>The goal of gamut clipping is to take colors that are outside the target gamut, and map them back to valid colors in a way that avoids perceived distortion and artifacts. In this article we also want to do this in a way that is reasonably efficient and simple to implement. Many techniques require complex iterative algorithms per pixel (or storing the results in 3D lookup tables) – those will not be considered here, but can be useful for many applications.</p><p>Instead we will take this commonly used approach:</p><ul><li>Work in a perceptual color space.</li><li>Keep hue constant, only change lightness and chroma.</li><li>Only project color along straight lines in the perceptual color space.</li></ul><p>For an overview of different approaches, see the paper <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236121201_The_Fundamentals_of_Gamut_Mapping_A_Survey">The Fundamentals of Gamut Mapping: A Survey</a>.</p><p>As a color space, we will use the <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/">Oklab</a> perceptual color space, since it models hue, chroma and lightness well while being easy to work with mathematically. In particular, with Oklab, the shape of the gamut of an RGB color space is described by cubic polynomials, which are quite practical to work with compared to the equations you get with other spaces.</p><p>Since we have decided to keep hue constant, it is now possible to plot the problem in two dimensions, using lightness, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, and chroma, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. To better understand the shape of the sRGB gamut, let’s look at of slices of constant hue. These are sampled every 30 degrees:</p><br><p>Our goal is to find a way to map colors outside the gamut, shown in grey in the graphs, back into the gamut using straight lines.

Again, one step of Halley’s method is enough to do this with high accuracy.</p><p>Altogether, this is everything needed to find the intersection between a line and the sRGB gamut. To derive the numerical approximation of the location of the cusp, this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JdXHhEyjjEE--19ZPH1bZV_LiGQBndzs?usp=sharing">Google Colab Notebook</a> was used.

choice of projection will always be a matter of preference. Overall I think preserving lightness does the best overall of the above methods (and others agree, it is a commonly used technique). One challenge with preserving lightness though is that all colors with <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L&gt;1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> or <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L&lt;0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> get projected to a single point, and that highly saturated colors can become almost completely desaturated if light or dark enough, even though sacrificing just a small amount of lightness would have resulted in a much closer match.</p><p>For this reason I’ve looked into creating new methods that mostly preserve lightness, but behaves closer to the single point projection methods for high and low lightness colors. The result is two new methods. They are novel as far as I am aware, but there are a lot of gamut mapping papers I haven’t read.</p><p>The first method is based on projection towards <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mn>5</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L=0.5, C=0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and the second based on <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>L</mi><mrow><mi>c</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>p</mi></mrow></msub><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L=L_{cusp}, C=0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.

	<p>Garbage collectors (GCs) feel like some sort of esoteric programming magic.  What’s really funny is
that a simple good-enough garbage collector is actually quite easy to write.  The core functionality
of a basic tri-color GC is only around 250 lines of C code.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The only real hard part about writing a GC is to build the confidence that – yes – <em>you</em> are
capable of writing one!  Really: this isn’t black magic.  If you can write C code, and you
understand pointers and basic bit manipulation, then you’re perfectly capable of understanding and
writing GCs.</p>

<p>I researched a couple different GC algorithms, and settled on a basic tri-color mark-sweep for this
experiment.  I insisted that the GC be incremental so that I could use it in game engines if I
wanted – I didn’t want to have long pauses while the GC was running, which would affect frame rate.</p>

<h2 id="allocation">Allocation</h2>

<p>You would think Garbage Collectors are about collecting garbage.  That’s only half of the equation
though.  The GC begins at <em>allocation</em>.</p>

<p>When you design a garbage collector, you are first designing an allocater.</p>

<h3 id="tables">Tables</h3>

<p>Allocation is pretty simple: I preallocate a large table of each type.  For example, I have a string
table, a list table, a hash table, etc.</p>

<div>

		<p><img src="https://sean.cm/i/tricolor-garbage-collector/hash-table.png" alt="Basic Hash Table" onload="javascript: this.width /= 2; this.onload = null;"></p><p>
	
		Basic Hash Table
	
	</p>
</div>

<p>For the hash table, each slot in the table contains a <code>size</code>, a pointer to the list of <code>keys</code>, and a
pointer to the list of <code>values</code>.  The pointers are <code>NULL</code> when the slot is unallocated.</p>

<h3 id="bitmaps">Bitmaps</h3>

<p>Next, I use a <em>bitmap</em> to track whether a slot is allocated or not.</p>

<p>Basically a bitmap is a list of 64-bit unsigned integers.  That means for each integer in the
bitmap, I can track 64 slots in my table.  For this reason, I preallocate the tables in multiples
of 64 slots, so that every bit in the bitmap is used.</p>

<div>

		<p><img src="https://sean.cm/i/tricolor-garbage-collector/hash-table2.png" alt="Allocation Bitmap" onload="javascript: this.width /= 2; this.onload = null;"></p><p>
	
		Allocation Bitmap
	
	</p>
</div>

<p>If a bit is <code>1</code>, then the corresponding slot is allocated – otherwise, the slot is free to use.</p>

<h3 id="allocation-algorithm">Allocation Algorithm</h3>

<p>At this point, it’s pretty obvious how allocation would work: if we need a new hash, then scan the
allocation bitmap for a <code>0</code>.  The first <code>0</code> we find will give us the slot to use.</p>

<p>Then, set the bit to <code>1</code> to indicate that the slot is now allocated, and return the slot.</p>

<p>The only trick here is to scan the allocation bitmap quickly: we can check 64 slots at a time by
just seeing if the allocation integer is <code>0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFLL</code> (64-bit unsigned int with all bits
set).</p>

<p>Once we find a non-full integer, then find the first bit inside the integer that is a <code>0</code>.  Turns
out the C function <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/ffs.3.html"><code>ffsll</code></a> finds the first <code>1</code>
pretty damn quickly, so we just need to bit-not (<code>~</code>), and search for <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>(<code>ffsll</code> also starts counting at 1, but we want to start counting at 0, so we subtract 1)</p>

<p>Here’s the allocation code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int64_t</span> <span>bmp_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>uint64_t</span> <span>*</span><span>bmp</span><span>,</span> <span>int64_t</span> <span>slots</span><span>){</span>
  <span>// search for the first 0 bit, set it to 1,</span>
  <span>// then return the slot</span>
  <span>// return -1 if nothing found</span>
  <span>slots</span> <span>/=</span> <span>64</span><span>;</span> <span>// checking 64 slots at a time</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int64_t</span> <span>loop</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>loop</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>slots</span><span>;</span> <span>loop</span><span>++</span><span>){</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>bmp</span> <span>==</span> <span>0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFLL</span><span>){</span>
      <span>// this area is full, go to the next area</span>
      <span>bmp</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
      <span>continue</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>// we're guaranteed at least one bit is 0</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>ffsll</span><span>(</span><span>~*</span><span>bmp</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>*</span><span>bmp</span> <span>|=</span> <span>1LL</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>pos</span><span>;</span> <span>// set the bit at pos</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>loop</span> <span>*</span> <span>64</span> <span>+</span> <span>pos</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hopefully that isn’t too scary for you.  It’s just what I’ve described.</p>

<p>The only thing left is when <code>bmp_alloc</code> returns <code>-1</code>, that means our table is completely full, so we
need to grow our table and bitmap.  That’s just a matter of <code>realloc</code> and <code>memset</code>.</p>

<p>And that’s it for allocation!  See, writing your own allocater isn’t that hard :-).</p>

<h2 id="marksweep">Mark/Sweep</h2>

<p>Now we get to the core algorithm.</p>

<p>Mark/sweep is dead simple – our goal is to traverse all the values to see what is reachable from
the machine.  After we’re done traversing, whatever is allocated <em>but unreachable</em> needs to be
deallocated.</p>

<p>So if you think about it, this is what we need:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A way to mark that we’ve visited a value</li>
  <li>A way to crack open a value and visit everything inside</li>
  <li>A starting point</li>
</ol>

<p>The basic algorithm will be:</p>

<h4 id="phase-1-start">Phase 1: Start</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Clear the mark on all values, everywhere</li>
  <li>Create a list of values that need to be processed (the “pending” list)</li>
  <li>Add the starting values to the pending list, marking them</li>
  <li>Go to phase 2</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="phase-2-mark">Phase 2: Mark</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Pull a value off the pending list</li>
  <li>Crack it open and traverse all the values inside of it</li>
  <li>For each child value, if it is already marked, ignore it; if it isn’t marked, mark it, and add
it to the pending list</li>
  <li>Keep pulling values off the pending list and processing them until the list is empty – then go
to phase 3</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="phase-3-sweep">Phase 3: Sweep</h4>

<ol>
  <li>For every allocated value, check to see if it’s marked</li>
  <li>If a value isn’t marked, then free any memory associated with the object, and clear the
allocation bit of its slot, so it can be reused</li>
  <li>Go back to phase 1</li>
</ol>

<p>Make sure this makes sense!</p>

<p>The final code won’t look exactly like this, but this is the essence of the algorithm.  Convince
yourself that this algorithm <em>works</em>.</p>

<p>It’s important to truly and deeply understand this core algorithm, because later we’re going to have
to figure out how to make this incremental without screwing it up.</p>

<h2 id="referenced-bitmap">Referenced Bitmap</h2>

<p>So, it looks like we’ll need a way to mark each value.  Let’s use another bitmap.</p>

<p>For each table, in addition to the allocation bitmap, we’ll have a referenced bitmap.  The
referenced bitmap will have a <code>1</code> if the value is marked, indicating that it is reachable from the
starting point.</p>

<div>

		<p><img src="https://sean.cm/i/tricolor-garbage-collector/hash-table3.png" alt="Referenced Bitmap" onload="javascript: this.width /= 2; this.onload = null;"></p><p>
	
		Referenced Bitmap
	
	</p>
</div>

<p>This might seem a bit weird to use these bitmaps – why not just put an allocation bool and a
referenced bool inside of each slot in the table?</p>

<p>Speed, of course.</p>

<p>Remember that our allocation algorithm could check 64 slots at a time – it didn’t have to run down
each slot and look at each individual bool.  We’ll see more bit tricks that will speed up
deallocation later.</p>

<h2 id="starting-point">Starting Point</h2>

<p>Where do you start?  That depends on your VM.</p>

<p>This experimental VM is a register based machine.  That means I have instructions like
<code>R3 = StrCat R2, R0</code>, which says “create a new string by concatenating the strings in register 2 and
register 0, and store the result in register 3”.</p>

<p>The key insight is that the registers alone work as a starting point.</p>

<p>Why is that?</p>

<p>The only way to reach an object is if the object is in one of the registers, <em>or</em> if you can
traverse to the object using what’s already in the registers.</p>

<p>So, if we use the registers as our starting point, our Mark phase will do the same traversal as
<em>any possible instruction sequence</em>, which guarantees that we won’t accidentally deallocate
something our VM could use.</p>

<h2 id="adding-to-the-pending-list">Adding to the Pending List</h2>

<p>One more thing…</p>

<p>We’ll be adding a lot of things to the pending list, in a lot of different scenarios, so it’s best
to think about solving the general case.</p>

<p>Suppose you are simply given a list of values.  How would you determine if they should be added to
the pending list?</p>

<p>The value’s type must be checked, and categorized into three basic buckets:</p>

<h3 id="non-allocated-values">Non-allocated Values</h3>

<p>If the value is <code>void</code>, <code>null</code>, boolean, or a number, then it’s skipped entirely: the GC doesn’t
operate on these values, because they aren’t allocated in the first place.</p>

<h3 id="allocated-but-non-traversable">Allocated but Non-traversable</h3>

<p>If the value can’t be traversed, then it’s marked, but it isn’t put on the pending list.  Why put
something on the pending list if it doesn’t have any child values?  Think of a string: yes, it’s
allocated, but you can’t crack it open and find more values inside of it.</p>

<h3 id="allocated-and-traversable">Allocated and Traversable</h3>

<p>Lastly, we have values that are allocated and can be traversed – these are things like lists and
hashes.</p>

<p>If the value is already marked, then we ignore it.  That’s because if it’s marked, that means it’s
already been processed, so we don’t want to process it all over again.</p>

<p>Otherwise, <em>finally</em>, at this point, we mark the value, and add it to the pending list.  This is the
only situation where a value is added to the pending list.</p>

<h3 id="code">Code</h3>

<p>Here is a basic implementation.  I call the function <code>gc_add_gray</code> because in traditional GC
terminology, adding something to the pending list is “coloring it gray”. Silly, I know, but we’re
stuck with it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>gc_add_gray</span><span>(</span><span>uint32_t</span> <span>size</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span> <span>*</span><span>vals</span><span>){</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>size</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span><span>;</span>

  <span>uint64_t</span> <span>*</span><span>ref_bmp</span><span>;</span>
  <span>uint32_t</span> <span>slot</span><span>;</span>

  <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int64_t</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>size</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>){</span>
    <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>vals</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>];</span>
    <span>switch</span> <span>(</span><span>value_type</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>)){</span>
      <span>case</span> <span>VALUE_TYPE_NUM</span><span>:</span>
        <span>// skip unallocated values</span>
        <span>continue</span><span>;</span>

      <span>case</span> <span>VALUE_TYPE_STR</span><span>:</span>
        <span>// just set the referenced bmp's bit at</span>
        <span>// the slot and move on</span>

        <span>ref_bmp</span> <span>=</span> <span>hash_referenced_bmp</span><span>;</span>
        <span>break</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// if it's already referenced, then skip it</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>bmp_hasbit</span><span>(</span><span>ref_bmp</span><span>,</span> <span>slot</span><span>))</span>
      <span>continue</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// otherwise, mark it and add it to pending</span>
    <span>bmp_setbit</span><span>(</span><span>ref_bmp</span><span>,</span> <span>slot</span><span>);</span>
    <span>vals_filtered</span><span>[</span><span>size_filtered</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>v</span><span>;</span>

  <span>gc_add_pending</span><span>(</span><span>size_filtered</span><span>,</span> <span>vals_filtered</span><span>);</span>
  <span>free</span><span>(</span><span>vals_filtered</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="phase-1-start-1">Phase 1: Start</h2>

<p>Now, it should be obvious how to implement Phase 1.</p>

<p>Clearing the mark for all values is easy, just <code>memset</code> the entire referenced bitmap to <code>0</code> for each
table.</p>

<p>Creating the pending list is easy… something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>pending_list_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>int</span> <span>pending_list_total</span> <span>=</span> <span>256</span><span>;</span>
<span>value</span> <span>*</span><span>pending_list</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>pending_list_total</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is your basic variable length list implementation in C.  Nothing new here.</p>

<p>(In practice, the pending list is only created once, and we just empty it here by setting
<code>pending_list_size</code> to <code>0</code>)</p>

<p>Adding the registers is cake too!</p>

<p>Something like: <code>gc_add_gray(registers_size, registers);</code></p>

<h2 id="phase-2-mark-1">Phase 2: Mark</h2>

<p>This is now pretty simple because we’re guaranteed only traversable values end up on the pending</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p>In the hours following a massive data leak where data from <a href="https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/brazils-health-ministrys-website-data-leak-exposed-243-million-medical-records-for-more-than-6-months/">almost all Brazilians</a> was exposed, users of the only industry where kind of mass security failure routinely happens concluded there was no way to prevent such breaches from taking place. “This is literally hundreds of millions of people, but sometimes these things happen and there’s nothing anyone can do to stop them”, said Bark Megor, echoing sentiments expressed by millions of individuals who post their names, religion, sexuality and personal information into centralized computer networks in order to send cat memes to one another. “And besides,” he continued, “this only happened because some employee uploaded a spreadsheet with usernames, passwords and access keys <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/personal-data-of-16-million-brazilian-covid-19-patients-exposed-online/">into a GitHub repository</a>. Mistakes do happen, after all.”</p>
<p>The incident follows a long string of similar incidents. Some are due to sophisticated hacking, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches#Late_2014_breach">the Yahoo breaches in 2013 and 2014 of all 3 billion accounts on the site</a>, including names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords, and in some cases, personal security questions and answers. Others are due to mere incompetence of a subcontractor, as the <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/virtualization-and-cloud/data-on-123-million-us-households-exposed-due-to-misconfigured-aws-s3-bucket">2017 Equifax leak of nearly all US households</a> or in the <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-vast-breach-likud-campaign-leaks-id-phones-addresses-of-all-israeli-adults/">2020 leak in the Likud Party of names, ID, phones, addresses of all Israeli adults</a>. “You’d think every person in the world would have their name, address and personal information out there by now,” said Larissa Layer, “pretty soon we will reach herd immunity to doxxing so maybe it doesn’t matter so much?”</p>
<p>“It’s a shame, but what can we do?” asks Wenin Denig, quizically raising his eyebrow. “It’s not like we have some kind of  <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2130877/the-biggest-data-breaches-of-the-21st-century.html"><strong>alternative open source platform that lets each person and organization control their own data</strong></a>. ” When asked about WordPress, <a href="https://kinsta.com/wordpress-market-share/#:~:text=WordPress'%20market%20share%20is%2039,one%2Dthird%20of%20the%20web!">which powers 4 in 10 websites in the world</a>, he exclaimed, “Are you kidding? I want videoconferencing, chats, events, payments, profiles, and I want it all in real time with slick notifications. If I am going to check my phone 10 times a day, and share the latest controversy with my friends it’s definitely not going to be on that old software. That’s the modern internet industry. But they better beware, if WhatsApp wants to sell my data, I’ll show them!” At press time, millions of people around the world were seen switching from WhatsApp to Telegram and Signal, in an effort to escape putting all their data, conversations, money and votes in one place.</p>

<p>One of the interesting Amateur cubesats in yesterday’s <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-launches-143-satellites-transporter-1-rocket-landing">SpaceX Transporter-1 launch</a> from Cape Canaveral is <a href="https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/ideassat.htm">IDEASSat</a>, a 3U cubesat from the <a href="https://www.ncu.edu.tw/en">National Central University of the Republic of China</a> (Taiwan) designed to study ionospheric plasma. <a href="https://twitter.com/pe0sat">Jan van Gils PE0SAT</a> drew my attention to this satellite as he was <a href="https://twitter.com/pe0sat/status/1353418234679103489">trying to see</a> if it was possible to decode it with any of the decoders existing in <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/gr-satellites">gr-satellites</a>. <a href="https://www.dk3wn.info/wp/">Mike Rupprecht DK3WN</a> also helped with a good recording, much cleaner than the SatNOGS recording that Jan was using.</p>



<p>Presumably this satellite uses “AX25, 9k6, GMSK”, as listed at the bottom of this page from <a href="https://www.nspo.narl.org.tw/inprogress.php?c=20030402&amp;ln=en">Taiwan’s National Space Organization</a>, and also in <a href="https://irsl.ss.ncu.edu.tw/media/paper/2020281.pdf">this research paper</a>. However, this is not true. It’s simple to check that the usual 9k6 FSK AX.25 decoders aren’t able to decode this signal, and a look at the FSK symbols shows that there is no scrambler (9k6 AX.25 uses the G3RUH scrambler) and that the symbol sequence doesn’t have much to do with AX.25.</p>



<p>After some reverse-enginnering, yesterday I figured out how the coding used by IDEASSat worked, and today I <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/gr-satellites/commit/17be909a338f0a8fe4b9931cc672d7453cff2d52">added a decoder to gr-satellites</a> to help Mike investigate what kind of telemetry the packets contain. The protocol is not very good, so I think it’s interesting to document it in detail, as some sort of lessons learned. In this post I’ll do so. As it turns out, the protocol has some elements that loosely resemble AX.25, so I’m left wondering whether this is some unsuccessful attempt at implementing standard AX.25 (we’ve already seen very weird attempts, <a href="https://destevez.net/2018/12/decoding-eseo/">such as ESEO</a>).</p>



<p>An excerpt of the recording that Mike sent me can be found as <code><a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/satellite-recordings/blob/master/ideassat.wav">ideassat.wav</a></code> in my <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/satellite-recordings">satellite-recordings repo</a>. From the recording, which is already FM-demodulated, it is clear that the modulation is 9k6 FSK.</p>



<p>The first thing that shocked me when looking at Mike’s recording is that there doesn’t seem to be any preamble. The packet starts directly with the data, as shown here. This is very bad, because closed-loop clock recovery algorithms need a preamble to lock to the symbol clock.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_no_preamble.png"><img src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_no_preamble-644x78.png" alt="" width="610" height="73" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_no_preamble-644x78.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_no_preamble-300x36.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_no_preamble-768x93.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_no_preamble.png 1499w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px"></a><figcaption>Beginning of an IDEASSat burst</figcaption></figure>



<p>There is another bad thing about the FSK burst. If we look at the full burst, we see that before and after the burst there is a part that starts negative and slowly decays exponentially to zero.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_full.png"><img width="644" height="77" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_full-644x77.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_full-644x77.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_full-300x36.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_full-768x92.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ideassat_full.png 1501w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a><figcaption>Full IDEASSat burst</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is caused by the fact that the FSK low tone is held for some 100ms before and after the FSK burst. Doing this at the beginning of the burst is a bad idea. Most FSK demodulators are AC coupled. Even the digital ones, as they use this to correct for frequency errors. So if one of the FSK tones is held for a significant amount of time, AC coupling will drive this tone to zero (just as we see with Mike’s recording). Thus, when the FSK burst starts, it will do so with a large DC offset, as we can see in the first figure.</p>



<p>In any case, all these problems can be sorted out (at least for manual inspection) by using a DC block in <a href="https://www.gnuradio.org/">GNU Radio</a> to correct for the DC offset at the beginning of the burst and <a href="http://www.ossmann.com/mike/">Mike Ossman’s</a> <a href="https://github.com/mossmann/clock-recovery">whole packet clock recovery script</a> to extract all the symbols in the burst regardless of the lack of preamble.</p>



<p>After looking at the symbols for a while with <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, I realized that they were NRZ-I encoded UART-like data. By NRZ-I I mean the usual differential encoding from AX.25, where a 0 is encoded as a symbol change and a 1 is encoded as no symbol change. I say UART-like because it is exactly like 8-bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter#Data_framing">UART</a> with one stop bit and no parity (1N8 for short) except for the fact that bytes are transmitted most-significant-bit first, whereas most UART transmit bytes in least-significant-bit first ordering.</p>



<p>The clues that lead me to this conclusion are the following:</p>



<ul><li>Differential decoding yields a richer autocorrelation than if we don’t do differential decoding; it’s always handy to see how differential decoding changes the autocorrelation</li><li>After differential decoding, the autocorrelation showed peaks every 10 bits, and much larger peaks every 400 bits (which I’ll explain later)</li><li>Arranging the symbols in 10 bit segments, there were two adjacent bits that had constant and opposite values; these strongly suggest the stop and start bits of UART</li><li>The fact that the start bit of UART must be zero and the stop bit must be one indicates NRZ-I rather than plain differential decoding (the two are related by a bitwise inversion)</li><li>When interpreting the UART bytes as most-significant-bit first, I got ASCII data</li></ul>



<p>When decoded as NRZ-I 1N8 MSB UART, I got the following data in hex. The line breaks are mine for clarity and I’ve corrected a few obvious bit errors at the beginning by hand.</p>

<p>We see that the burst consists of 18 frames which are delimited by <code>0x7e</code> at the beginning and end. These resemble the HDLC flags. However, there aren’t any other aspects of HDLC such as bit stuffing or the CRC-16. In fact, there doesn’t seem to be any CRC that can be used to discard frames with bit errors. Frames have 40 bytes, and begin in the same way, which explains the strong autocorrelation at lags of 400 bits and multiples (recall that with 1N8 UART we have 10 bits per byte).</p>



<p>Now, the beginning of the frames is ASCII for</p>



<pre>BN0CU 0BN0IDA0</pre>



<p>These are almost like the AX.25 destination and source addresses (with a SSID of 0) that occur at the beginning of the AX.25 header. However, in <a href="http://www.ax25.net/AX25.2.2-Jul%2098-2.pdf">standard AX.25</a> these should be written in the 7 MSBs of each byte (so they don’t look like ASCII text), whereas in IDEASSat these are written in the 7 LSBs of each byte. I’ve encountered this misunderstanding about AX.25 address fields in other occasions.</p>



<p>After the two “addresses”, we have the byte <code>f0</code>, which probably is the PID field with the <em>No Layer 3 protocol</em> value. However, the control field byte, which in standard AX.25 is placed between the addresses and the PID, would be missing.</p>



<p>After the “PID field” we have 23 bytes of what seems to be telemetry. We don’t have a description for the telemetry format. However, it seems that the first of these 23 bytes is a counter that counts from 0 to 8 and iterates through 9 different telemetry structures. Most of the telemetry values seem simple 8-bit signed channels, and structure number 5 contains the ASCII string <code>B0BMFUN</code>. In this example burst, each of the two repetitions of each telemetry structure contains the same values. Probably this is always the case to increase the reliability.</p>



<p>So how does the IDEASSat gr-satellites <a href="https://gr-satellites.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components.html#deframers">deframer</a> work? Well, first off, I don’t think that the protocol used by IDEASSat is very good for transmitting data over RF. In fact it is not robust at all, and bit errors will cause all sorts of problems. </p>



<p>Besides the problem of the lack of preamble, using UART over RF is never a good idea. The state machine that tracks start and stop bits is prone to fall into all sorts of traps because of bit errors (unless a very complicate state machine is used). Incidentally, using UART, with or without NRZ-I, guarantees a bit transition every 10 bits, so at least this is good for clock recovery.</p>



<p>The use of <code>0x7e</code> to delimit frames can create a problem if that byte appears in the data (or even if it appears as a cause of bit errors). Finally, there is no means to check if decoded packets are corrupt.</p>



<p>I’m sure that with effort it would be possible to create a somewhat smart decoder for this protocol. Whole packet clock recovery could be used to prevent the problems caused by the lack of preamble. After NRZ-I decoding, the bits could be correlated against the expected UART start and stop bits for robust byte synchronization. If we use the fact that frames are 40 bytes long, then frame synchronization can also be made robust by finding several <code>0x7e</code> bytes (maybe correlating against the 36 <code>0x7e</code> bytes that we know should appear in an 18 frame burst). And finally the bit errors in the UART start and stop bits could be used as a heuristic of how many bit errors there were in the useful data, as a means to discard garbage frames. However, I don’t think it’s worth the effort. In the end, this protocol doesn’t have any FEC, and it is something ad-hoc used by just one satellite.</p>



<p>Therefore, today I decided to write a much simpler deframer for gr-satellites, with the goal of not investing much effort and having quickly something ready that Mike could use to start decoding frames.</p>



<p>The decoder in gr-satellites uses the standard <a href="https://gr-satellites.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components.html#fsk-demodulator">FSK demodulator</a>, which does closed-loop clock recovery with the <a href="https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Symbol_Sync">Symbol sync block</a>. The FSK symbols are NRZ-I decoded and then the sequence <code>00111111010011…</code></p></div></article></div>

    <p><a href="https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/scnow/name/brad-cox-obituary?pid=197454225">Dr. Brad J. Cox Ph.D. 1944 - 2021</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Brad Cox, Ph.D of Manassas, Virginia, died on January 2, 2021 at his residence. Dr. Cox was a computer scientist known mostly for creating the Objective – C programming language with his business partner, Tom Love, and for his work in software engineering (specifically software reuse) and software componentry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had always struggled building apps for the Mac, first in Classic MacOS and then in Mac OS X. I used Java, I used REALbasic, and I even had a professional license for Metrowerk's CodeWarrior so I could write apps in C or C++. But there was always some sort of mental block, or maybe the way my brain worked never really lined up with the way these programming languages did. Out of these I was most efficient with Java, but the UI toolkit was pretty lacking.</p>
<p>Then I saw these cool apps coming out for Mac OS X, and they were proudly written in Objective-C.</p>
<p>I took a couple of runs at it.  The brackets and pointers threw me off, but I kept on trying because I knew I needed to learn this language to build the apps I wanted to see in this world.</p>
<p>And then one day, I believe when plugging away on my little internet search utility <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030204023115/http://www.flyingmeat.com/vnk/">VoodooNetKey</a>, everything clicked.</p>
<p>Pointers, the brackets, selectors, messages. Oh my god, I get it now — the brackets! It's not a function call, it's something way better!</p>
<p>Everything just sort of aligned in my brain. Previously I found myself struggling to express the ideas I had in my head, and it was a frustrating experience. Now I was struggling to type fast enough and come up with new ideas that I could express in Objective-C. I felt like I could do anything I wanted with it.</p>
<p>And loadable bundles, and input managers- I can't express to you about how much fun it was being able to inject my Objective-C code into Safari or other applications to add functionality at runtime. Or using class-dump against the system frameworks to explore private methods. NSObject's <code>performSelector:</code> was just so great when you needed to quickly hack around something.</p>
<p>Objective-C was brilliant, powerful, and elegant.</p>
<p>All my applications are written in Objective-C even to this day. I play around in other languages from time to time, but I haven't found one that fits me like Objective-C does.</p>
<p>I realize it's not for everyone, and that Objective-C requires discipline, but it's been amazing for me. I owe my career in part to Brad Cox's creation, and I am forever grateful for it.</p>

<p>The following draft is concerned with the curious use of the nickname 'Cousin Jack' for the Cornish in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The 'Great Emigration' of the Cornish between around 1815 and the First World War saw what has been termed the 'wholescale scattering' of the Cornish to the new mining frontiers of North and South America, Australia and South Africa. From at least the mid-nineteenth century, these emigrants were known as 'Cousin Jacks', but the origin of this term seems rather obscure. The aim of the following note is to investigate the evidence for the early usage of the term 'Cousin Jack' and make some suggestions as to its origins in light of this evidence.&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qQtckgdORQ0/YAmWCnM8nfI/AAAAAAADP2I/SjbyinJIJ6QT1a5SiULZKMsl4eStLMsowCLcBGAsYHQ/s952/cousin-jack-cover-pryor.jpg"><img data-original-height="952" data-original-width="806" height="500" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qQtckgdORQ0/YAmWCnM8nfI/AAAAAAADP2I/SjbyinJIJ6QT1a5SiULZKMsl4eStLMsowCLcBGAsYHQ/w339-h400/cousin-jack-cover-pryor.jpg" width="424"></a></td></tr><tr><td>The cover of Oswald Pryor's <i>Cousin Jack Cartoons</i>&nbsp;(Sydney, 1945); Pryor was the son of Cornish parents and born at Moonta, South Australia. The books says the following of the front cover image: 'The cover design suggests a miner who has knocked off early, and has come up a ladderway remote from the main shaft in order to avoid running into the boss. Unfortunately he has run into the trouble he meant to avoid. This situation will be, obvious to all who know the Moonta scene. —The miner's hat here depicted is made of hard compressed pulp and colored a deep maroon when new. The candle is stuck on the front of the hat with a lump of wet red clay. This was the practice of old Cornish miners for generations.' (Image: <a href="http://search.slv.vic.gov.au/primo-explore/fulldisplay?vid=MAIN&amp;docid=SLV_VOYAGER951330&amp;context=L">State Library of Victoria</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The 'Great Emigration' of the Cornish in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries seems to have occurred on a quite remarkable scale. Margaret James-Korany has, for example, identified 42,000 individual emigrants sailing from the principal ports of Cornwall for Canada between 1831 and 1860, with some 6,200 leaving from Padstow alone in that period, and this outflow continued long after 1860 too. Thus the&nbsp;<i>Cornish Telegraph</i>&nbsp;for 5 September 1866 published a piece regretting 'the rage for emigration' in recent years, noting that 'the rush for Australia and America has been very great', and recent calculations suggest that at least 240,000 Cornish went overseas between 1860 and 1900, with a similar number leaving for England and Wales, with the result that Cornwall lost around a third of its population across the period. This depopulation was particularly marked amongst the youngest age-groups. Philip Payton observes that 44.8% of the Cornish male population aged fifteen to twenty-four left for overseas between 1861 and 1900, along with 26.2% of the female population in the same age group, and another 30% and 35.5% respectively left for other counties within Britain as well.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn1">1</a>)</p><p>The use of the term 'Cousin Jack' for the Cornish, particularly miners and especially emigrant miners, along with its companion-term 'Cousin Jenny', is well-evidenced from the second half of the nineteenth century onwards. John H. Forster's account of 'Life in the copper mines of Lake Superior', given to the Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society in 1887, contains the following illustrative passage:</p><blockquote><p>The Cornishman, or "<b><u>cousin Jack</u></b>," is a native of the duchy of Cornwall, England... The Cornishman of the present day, like his father, is of a roving disposition. His footsteps may be traced around the globe. There is no prominent mining field in the world wherein you will not find "<b><u>Cousin Jack</u></b>." He is in Alaska, California, the Rocky Mountains, Mexico, Central and South America, in Australia, India and Lake Superior. He is a first rate miner and possesses a certain sturdiness of frame and disposition that commends him to the observer. He works hard, eats well and fights bravely. He is, numerically, very strong in our northern mines, and, being, as a rule, steady, conservative and skillful, he finds ready employment. He likes mining; esteems his vocation among the most honorable, if not aristocratic. He despises the duties of an ordinary day laborer. In short, he is a born miner and nothing else... But "<b><u>Cousin Jack</u></b>'s" language attracts most attention. His dialect, pure and simple, is unique. He uses many English words with a strange twist, while other words of his you would look for in vain in Webster's unabridged... But we find in the mines many gentlemen of Cornish birth who are well educated and efficient, occupying positions of trust and responsibility. Many of the captains and agents are Cornishmen.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn2">2</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Quite when and where these Cornish emigrants started to be known as 'Cousin Jacks' is not wholly clear, unfortunately, and various theories have been proposed over the years, most of which locate the genesis of the term overseas in America, Australia or other places where Cornish miners emigrated to in the nineteenth century. The&nbsp;<i>Cornubian and Redruth Times</i>&nbsp;in 1908, for example, carried a piece suggesting that the term 'Cousin Jack' was first used in the California mining districts in the very late 1840s and spread out from there, with the additional claim that 'twenty years ago the term in Cornwall was unknown'; however, as we shall see, neither claim stands up to scrutiny, and the reality is perhaps even more interesting.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn3">3</a>)</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-exfrGNkOVqo/YAmYpHYdTWI/AAAAAAADP2Y/L6Bvc2jy2Y4RFtBUXCGSsaP6B6uryfqNgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1241/nla.obj-133090696-1.jpg"><img data-original-height="1241" data-original-width="1000" height="500" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-exfrGNkOVqo/YAmYpHYdTWI/AAAAAAADP2Y/L6Bvc2jy2Y4RFtBUXCGSsaP6B6uryfqNgCLcBGAsYHQ/w323-h400/nla.obj-133090696-1.jpg"></a></td></tr><tr><td>An Australian Cousin Jack cartoon by Oswald Pryor from 1915; the caption reads 'Cousin Jack miner:- "Call isself Cap'n 'e do; and I 'spoase ef the truth ez known, 'e never did a day's work underground in all 'ez life."' (Image: <a href="https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-133090696/view">Trove</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Looking at the documentary evidence for the usage of the term, a traditional place to start is with the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, which&nbsp;cites a number of examples of the use of Cousin Jack under their <i>Cousin, n.</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Jack, n.¹</i>&nbsp;entries. One, from Rolf Boldrewood's Australian novel&nbsp;<i>Miner's Right</i>&nbsp;of 1890, describes 'a short man, whose blue-black curly hair and deep-set eyes betrayed the Cousin Jack',(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn4">4</a>) whilst the earliest given is from&nbsp;<i>The Star</i> newspaper&nbsp;of&nbsp;Ballarat, Victoria (Australia) on the 19 March 1857, which runs as follows:</p><blockquote><p>They were ‘Tips’, and ‘Geordies’, and ‘<b><u>Cousin Jacks</u></b>’, altogether, and I did as well as I could.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn5">5</a>)&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The fact that both of the early citations are from Australia has sometimes been taken to suggest that the term could have emerged there, and it is certainly treated as such by the <i>English Dialect Dictionary</i>&nbsp;under&nbsp;its entry for&nbsp;<i>Cousin</i>.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn6">6</a>) In addition to these entries, the <i>OED </i>also records what it treats as a variant of Cousin Jack, <i>Cousin Jacky.</i> This is said to be documented first in the <i>South Australian Register</i>, from Adelaide,<i>&nbsp;</i>for 2 June 1854, via the following passage: 'John O'Connell then said to him, ‘You're a b——, <b><u>Cousin Jacky</u></b>, an't you?'', although the term also occurs in dialogue from Australian court reports of the 1840s too, <i>e.g.</i> 'I don't like <b><u>you cousin Jackies</u></b>, keep your own company, and I'll keep mine', which appeared in the&nbsp;<i>South Australian</i>, 30 May 1848.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn7">7</a>) However, 'Cousin Jacky' is not only documented in Australian contexts; it also appears in, for example, Thomas Quiller Couch's <i>East Cornwall Words</i>, published by the English Dialect Society in 1880, where it is treated as an East Cornwall term for a miner from West Cornwall:</p><blockquote><p>There is a marked difference between the speech of East and West Cornwall... At the beginning of the present century mining adventure, especially in the search for copper, became a furor in East Cornwall, and a passionate enthusiasm brought hither the skilled miners of the West, who flocked to the banks of Tywardreath Bay, and further east to the central granite ridge about the tors of Caradon. These immigrants brought with them and have left an infusion of their language, especially its technical portion, but I remember when it was a great mimetic feat, and productive of much mirth amongst us, to be able to imitate the talk of <b><u>Cousin Jacky</u></b>&nbsp;from Redruth or St. Just.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn8">8</a>)</p></blockquote><p>T. Q. Couch of Bodmin, the father of Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch (aka Q), was born in 1826 at Lansallos near Fowey, and seems to be here recounting a usage known to him in his youth, and is clearly referring to someone from West Cornwall, not a Cornish emigrant overseas. Likewise, in a letter printed in the&nbsp;<i>West Briton and Cornwall Advertiser</i> for 28 March 1862, Christopher Childs of Liskeard uses 'Cousin Jacky' in passing as a seemingly well-known, common and friendly term traditionally used between Cornish miners:</p><blockquote><p>The very motto of the Cornish miners, "One and All," at once bespeaks our favour, and indicates that [Cornish miners] are not naturally selfish, but on the contrary, are kindly disposed one toward another. If any one doubt this, let him attend the funeral of a miner, and observe how they congregate to pay the last sad tribute of respect, and drop a tear over the grave of their departed comrade... How forcibly does the familiar name "comrade," and the expression of "<b><u>Com'se along Cousin Jacky</u></b>," speak in favour of his friendly and social disposition.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn9">9</a>)</p></blockquote><p>In contrast, in Margaret Ann Courtney's <i>West Cornwall Words</i>&nbsp;(which was bound together with Couch's <i>East Cornwall Words&nbsp;</i>of 1880), 'Cousin Jacky' features as&nbsp;a local dialect term meaning 'a foolish person, a coward', with 'Cousin Jan' instead being given as the name for Cornishman—the latter variant is discussed further below, as is the former definition for Cousin Jacky.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn10">10</a>)&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xpy9aMOhrE8/YAmsAmjnqOI/AAAAAAADP3M/MB2xsu27hYkyWoIx53xnp4DtipZEHK_CACLcBGAsYHQ/s1162/CornishGhostStory1862.jpg"><img data-original-height="862" data-original-width="1162" height="370" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xpy9aMOhrE8/YAmsAmjnqOI/AAAAAAADP3M/MB2xsu27hYkyWoIx53xnp4DtipZEHK_CACLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h296/CornishGhostStory1862.jpg" width="500"></a></td></tr><tr><td>The first two pages of Elfin's <i>A Cornish Ghost Story</i>, first published at Truro sometime before 1862; these two pages are taken from an 1868 edition of the text in <i>Cornish Tales in Prose and Verse</i>&nbsp;(Truro: Netherton, 1868), pp. 37<span>–</span>8 (image: <a href="https://archive.org/details/cornishpales00treggoog/page/n243/mode/2up">Internet Archive</a>).</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Needless to say, the above references do seem to cast serious doubt upon the implication of the report in the&nbsp;<i>Cornubian and Redruth Times&nbsp;</i>in 1908 that the term 'Cousin Jack' and similar was unknown in Cornwall in the late 1880s, and in this light it is worth noting that Sharron Schwartz has, in fact, suggested that the 'evidence seems to point to the mines of Devonshire in the eighteenth century' as the place where the term Cousin Jack originated, via migrant Cornish miners seeking work in Devon rather than overseas.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn11">11</a>) Although she unfortunately offers no citation to …</p></div></div>

          <p>A few months ago I experimented with DigitalOcean spaces as my backup solution that could <a href="https://mitjafelicijan.com/digitalocean-spaces-to-sync-between-computers.html">replace Dropbox eventually</a>. That solution worked quite nicely, and I was amazed how smashing together a couple of existing solutions would work this fine.</p>
<p>I have been running that solution in the background for a couple of months now and kind of forgot about it. But recent developments around deplatforming and having us people hostages of technology and big companies speed up my goals to become less dependent on <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/17/tech/google-antitrust-lawsuit/index.html">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2048680/dropbox-takes-a-peek-at-files.html">Dropbox</a> etc and take back some control.</p>
<p>I am not a conspiracy theory nut, but to be honest, what these companies are doing lately is out of control. It is a matter of principle at this point. I have almost completely degoogled my life all the way from ditching Gmail, YouTube and most of the services surrounding Google. And I must tell you, I feel so good. I haven't felt this way for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>Anyways. Let's get to the meat of things.</strong></p>
<p>Before you continue you should read my post about <a href="https://mitjafelicijan.com/digitalocean-spaces-to-sync-between-computers.html">syncing to Dropbox</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also to note, I am using Linux on my machine with Gnome desktop environment. This should work on MacOS too. To use this on Windows I suggest using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">Subsystem for Linux</a> or <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="folder-structure">Folder structure</h2>
<p>I liked structure from Dropbox. One folder where everything is located and synced. So, that's why adopted this also for my sync setup.</p>
<pre><code>~/Vault
   ↳ backup
   ↳ bin
   ↳ documents
   ↳ projects
</code></pre>
<p>All of my code is located in <code>~/Vault/projects</code> folder. And most of the projects are Git repositories. I do not use this sync method for backup per see but in case I reinstall my machine I can easily recreate all the important folder structure with one quick command. No external drives needed that can fail etc.</p>
<h2 id="sync-script">Sync script</h2>
<p>My sync script is located in <code>~/Vault/bin/vault-backup.sh</code></p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# dconf load /com/gexperts/Tilix/ &lt; tilix.dconf
# 0 2 * * * sh ~/Vault/bin/vault-backup.sh

cd ~/Vault/backup/dotfiles

MACHINE=$(whoami)@$(hostname)
mkdir -p $MACHINE
cd $MACHINE

cp ~/.config/VSCodium/User/settings.json settings.json
cp ~/.s3cfg s3cfg
cp ~/.bash_extended bash_extended
cp ~/.ssh ssh -rf

codium --list-extensions &gt; vscode-extension.txt
dconf dump /com/gexperts/Tilix/ &gt; tilix.dconf

cd ~/Vault
s3cmd sync --delete-removed --exclude 'node_modules/*' --exclude '.git/*' --exclude '.venv/*' ./ s3://bucket-name/backup/

echo `date +"%D %T"` &gt;&gt; ~/.vault.log

notify-send \
	-u normal \
	-i /usr/share/icons/Adwaita/96x96/status/security-medium-symbolic.symbolic.png \
	"Vault sync succeded at `date +"%D %T"`"
</code></pre>
<p>This script also backups some of the dotfiles I use and sends notification to Gnome notification center. It is a straightforward solution. Nothing special going on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One obvious benefit of this is that I can omit syncing Node's <code>node_modules</code> or Python's <code>.venv</code> and <code>.git</code> folders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use this script in a combination with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">Cron</a>.</p>
<pre><code>0 2 * * * sh ~/Vault/bin/vault-backup.sh
</code></pre>
<p>When you start syncing your local stuff with a remote server you can review your items on DigitalOcean.</p>
<p><img src="https://mitjafelicijan.com/assets/dropbox-sync/dropbox-spaces.png" alt="Dropbox Spaces"></p>
<p>I have been using this script now for quite some time, and it's working flawlessly. I also uninstalled Dropbox and stopped using it completely.</p>
<p>All I need to do is write a Bash script that does the reverse and downloads from remote server to local folder. This could be another post.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lifespan.io/news/glucosamine/">Glucosamine</a> is a polysaccharide that naturally occurs in cartilaginous joint tissues and is involved in protein and lipid synthesis. Glucosamine is also present in other tissues, such as skin, nails, bones, and ligaments. Synovial fluid contains glucosamine and occupies the space between joints, helping to reduce the friction of joint surfaces. Glucosamine is commonly taken as a supplement to help with the joint pain and inflammation associated with aging.</p>
<p><b>What does not kill us makes us stronger</b></p>
<p>The <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33478352/">study</a> we want to spotlight today shows how glucosamine produces a caloric restriction-like effect in rats. The researchers treated young rats and accelerated aging rats with regular doses of glucosamine, then they examined a number of aging biomarkers.</p>
<p>There was a significant rise in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in both young and accelerated aging rats. ROS are reactive molecules and free radicals derived from oxygen, and while they do have some beneficial uses, such as being used by immune cells as a component of the killing response to combat microbial invasion, they are also very harmful to cells. Free radicals each possess an unpaired electron, making them highly reactive and thus able to damage all macromolecules, including lipids, proteins and nucleic acids.</p>
<p>ROS is produced as a byproduct during the mitochondrial electron transport of aerobic respiration or by oxidoreductase enzymes and metal catalyzed oxidation. Mitochondria also produce increasing amounts of potentially harmful ROS as they become increasingly dysfunctional, and mitochondrial dysfunction is <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/topic/mitochondrial-dysfunction/">a hallmark of aging</a>.</p>
<p>It was originally thought that only phagocytic cells, which protect the body by ingesting harmful foreign particles, bacteria, and dead or dying cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils, produced ROS. This was shown to be incorrect, and more recent research shows that ROS has a role in cellular signaling, serving as both an intra- and intercellular messenger and influencing gene expression, apoptosis, and the activation of cellular signaling cascades.</p>
<p>The researchers suggest that glucosamine spurs a transient increase in ROS, which, in turn, triggers a protective mitohormetic response. Mitohormesis describes a process in which low levels of mitochondrial ROS act as signaling molecules to trigger a cascade of cellular events that protect the cells from harmful effects. Essentially, the small amount of stress caused by the ROS encourages the cell to raise its shields.</p>
<p>They believe that this response produces an effect similar to the stress response observed in caloric restriction, and multiple biomarkers showed that this is the case. The old saying “What does not kill us makes us stronger” appears to apply here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aging is strongly correlated with several non-communicable disorders such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative conditions. Glucosamine (2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose, GlcN) is a naturally occurring amino sugar and is reported to act as a caloric restriction mimetic (CRM). In young and D-galactose-induced accelerated rat aging models, we tested a persistent oral dietary dose of GlcN and evaluated various aging biomarkers in erythrocytes and plasma. A significant increase in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed in GlcN treated young and accelerated senescent rat model. Increased value of Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Potential (FRAP), Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), and Plasma membrane reduced system (PMRS) was observed. We suggest that GlcN induces a mitohormetic impact by a transient increase in ROS. Our findings indicate that GlcN may be a successful CRM.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>It should be noted that these results are in rats, but the idea that similar effects may occur in humans taking glucosamine is not beyond the realm of possibility. Caloric restriction increases lifespan in multiple species, so finding a way to emulate this effect without the need to engage in caloric restriction could have the potential to help people with metabolic conditions, such as diabetes and obesity.</p>

<p>It appears to be the case that glucosamine significantly reduces all-cause mortality in humans, according to not <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/news/glucosamine-supplementation-reduces-all-cause-mortality/">one</a> but <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/news/human-study-links-glucosamine-and-chondroitin-to-reduced-mortality/">two</a> large-scale studies conducted last year. Glucosamine is cheap, readily available, and has compelling health and safety data behind it, and it would be a dietary supplement worth considering for <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/news/developing-a-science-based-personal-longevity-strategy/">a science-based personal longevity strategy</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>Welcome back. This is the second post in my <em>Terrible Compiler for a Useless Language</em> series, in which I write about my attempt to implement a native Brainfuck compiler for x64 Linux. In this post, I'll be covering a basic parser for Brainfuck. Previous posts in the series:</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="is-this-italic-heading-thing-where-you-set-up-a-strawman-to-cut-down-so-you-can-feel-good-about-winning-an-imaginary-argument-going-to-be-a-regular-convention-from-now-on"><em>Is this "italic heading" thing where you set up a strawman to cut down so you can feel good about winning an imaginary argument going to be a regular convention from now on?</em></h2>
<p>Yes, how could you tell?</p>
<h2 id="i-got-the-acronym-joke-in-the-last-post-and-i-didn-t-like-it-it-s-in-poor-taste-personally-offends-me"><em>I got the acronym "joke" in the last post and I didn't like it. It's in poor taste/personally offends me.</em></h2>
<p>I don't like that joke either. Some kind of police force is necessary for society to function and we shouldn't say mean things about cops who aren't doing anything wrong (notice the lack of a comma before "who" here before you jump to conclusions). Worse yet, the acronym is <strong>badly spelled</strong>. But I <em>just couldn't resist</em>.</p>
<h2 id="get-to-the-point"><em>Get to the point</em>.</h2>
<p>But of course. Let's examine how Brainfuck works. What does Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">have to say</a> about it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notable for its extreme minimalism, the language consists of only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are the eight commands, then?</p>
<p><code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> respectively move the pointer backward and forward by one memory cell. As we've already mentioned at the very beginning, Brainfuck's memory cells are one byte in size and there's thirty thousand of them. These are our variables. Those of you, dear readers, coming from dynamically-typed languages like Python and JS, should be happy to hear that Brainfuck has no types.<br>
<code>-</code> and <code>+</code> decrement and increment the number in the memory cell at our pointer.<br>
<code>,</code> and <code>.</code> respectively get and put out one byte of data from/to the standard input/output.<br>
<code>[</code> and <code>]</code> are where things get <em>interesting</em> and Turing-complete - the former means "if the value at the pointer is 0, skip over to the instruction after the matching <code>]</code>". The latter means "if the value isn't zero, jump back to the instruction after the matching <code>[</code>". If this looks like a <code>while</code> loop to you, that's because it is one. Obviously, all square brackets must be paired up.</p>
<p>All other characters in a Brainfuck source file are considered comments and can be safely ignored. To work, then! Let's declare a new Cargo project with <code>cargo new bfc-rs</code>. Because we're trying to be slightly more professional this time, we won't stuff all the code in <code>main.rs</code>, we'll also create a <code>lib.rs</code> to hold the program's logic.</p>
<h2 id="defining-the-instructions">Defining the instructions</h2>
<p>Our first step should be to define a data type for Brainfuck commands:</p>
<pre><code><span>/// Type representing a standard Brainfuck instruction.
</span><span>#[</span><span>derive</span><span>(Debug, PartialEq)] </span><span>// this is for tests
</span><span>enum </span><span>BrainfuckInstr {
    </span><span>/// Move the data pointer back one cell.
</span><span>    PointerDec,
    </span><span>/// Move the data pointer forward one cell.
</span><span>    PointerInc,
    </span><span>/// Decrement the value of the current memory cell.
</span><span>    DataDec,
    </span><span>/// Increment the value of the current memory cell.
</span><span>    DataInc,
    </span><span>/// Get a byte from the standard input and store it in the current memory cell.
</span><span>    GetByte,
    </span><span>/// Write the current memory cell's value to the standard output.
</span><span>    PutByte,
    </span><span>/// Begin a while loop conditional on the current value not being zero.
</span><span>    WhileNonzero,
    </span><span>/// Close the while loop.
</span><span>    EndWhile
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>That's a secret. You'll find out two blogposts from now.</p>
<p>Anyway, that was easy. Now let's write a Brainfuck program that writes a newline to the standard output, because typing out a full Hello World would be a stupidly large amount of work:</p>
<pre><code><span>++++++++++ Add 10 to the current byte to make a newline or 0x0A byte
. Print it
</span></code></pre>
<p>I've saved it as <code>newline.bf</code> in our project's directory for later use. Now let's define a <code>Parser</code> struct, a <code>parse</code> function and write a test for it before we implement anything, because I think "Test-Driven Development" looks good on a resumé. From lib.rs:</p>
<pre><code><span>#[</span><span>cfg</span><span>(test)] </span><span>// only declare a "tests" module when the Rust compiler is in test mode
</span><span>mod </span><span>tests;

</span><span>/// The syntax errors possible.
</span><span>#[</span><span>derive</span><span>(Debug)]
</span><span>enum </span><span>SyntaxError {
    </span><span>/// A closing square bracket was found at the contained line:index position, but there was no opening square bracket before it.
</span><span>    PrematureEndWhile(</span><span>usize</span><span>, </span><span>usize</span><span>),
    </span><span>/// The last while loop opened, at the contained line:index position, has no closing bracket.
</span><span>    UnclosedWhile(</span><span>usize</span><span>, </span><span>usize</span><span>)
}
</span><span>/// Struct responsible for parsing Brainfuck.
</span><span>struct </span><span>Parser; </span><span>// empty because it has no internal state yet
</span><span>impl </span><span>Parser {
    </span><span>fn </span><span>parse</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>code</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>str</span><span>) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;BrainfuckInstr&gt;, SyntaxError&gt; {
        unimplemented!()
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The contents of our <code>tests.rs</code> file will be as follows:</p>
<pre><code><span>const </span><span>NEWLINE_PRINTING_PROGRAM</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>str </span><span>= include_str!("</span><span>../newline.bf</span><span>"); </span><span>// same thing as we did with the NASM template while writing HWDPC
</span><span>use super</span><span>::*; </span><span>// import all symbols from our parent module, the library root
</span><span>use </span><span>BrainfuckInstr::*;
#[</span><span>test</span><span>]
</span><span>fn </span><span>test_newline_program</span><span>() {
    </span><span>let mut</span><span> parser = Parser;
    </span><span>let</span><span> output = parser
    .</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>NEWLINE_PRINTING_PROGRAM</span><span>)
    .</span><span>expect</span><span>("</span><span>The newline program contains no syntax errors, something is wrong with the parser.</span><span>");
    </span><span>let</span><span> expected_output: Vec&lt;BrainfuckInstr&gt; = vec![
        DataInc, DataInc, DataInc, DataInc, DataInc,
        DataInc, DataInc, DataInc, DataInc, DataInc,
        PutByte
    ];
    assert_eq!(&amp;output, &amp;expected_output)
}
</span></code></pre><h2 id="writing-the-parser-logic">Writing the parser logic</h2>
<p>If we invoke <code>cargo test</code> right now, the test will unsurprisingly fail, because the <code>unimplemented!()</code> macro in <code>parse</code> makes the compiler think a value of the right type gets returned, but at runtime panics (=crashes) the thread it's running on, thus failing any test we put it in. Let's get to work actually implementing <code>parse</code>, then.</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>parse</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>code</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>str</span><span>) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;BrainfuckInstr&gt;, SyntaxError&gt; {
    </span><span>use </span><span>BrainfuckInstr::*;
    </span><span>let mut</span><span> output = Vec::new();
    </span><span>for </span><span>(line_number, line) in code.</span><span>lines</span><span>().</span><span>enumerate</span><span>() {
        </span><span>for </span><span>(ch_number, ch) in line.</span><span>chars</span><span>().</span><span>enumerate</span><span>() {

                '</span><span>-</span><span>' =&gt; DataDec,
                '</span><span>+</span><span>' =&gt; DataInc,
                '</span><span>,</span><span>' =&gt; GetByte,
                '</span><span>.</span><span>' =&gt; PutByte,
                '</span><span>[</span><span>' =&gt; WhileNonzero,
                '</span><span>]</span><span>' =&gt; EndWhile,
                _ =&gt; { </span><span>continue</span><span>; </span><span>/* skip this iteration if the character is something else */</span><span>}
            });
        }
    }
    </span><span>// Don't worry about the line and character numbers yet.
    </span><span>Ok(output)
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now, our tests pass, the whole one. This is too good, we need more tests.</p>
<h2 id="test-programs-meant-to-fail">Test programs meant to fail</h2>
<p>Let's write two faulty programs, <code>premature.bf</code> and <code>unmatched.bf</code>, and the corresponding tests.</p>
<pre><code><span>++++.,

</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>+++--.+[+
++[] This should crash the compiler because we never close the outer while loop.
Hey, this means we can use proper punctuation here, cause this code won't run.
</span></code></pre>
<p>The tests:</p>
<pre><code><span>#[</span><span>test</span><span>]
</span><span>fn </span><span>test_premature_program</span><span>() {
    </span><span>let mut</span><span> parser = Parser;

    .</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>PREMATURE_PROGRAM</span><span>)
    .</span><span>expect_err</span><span>("</span><span>The code in premature.bf shouldn't produce a valid instruction list.</span><span>");
    assert_eq!(output, SyntaxError::PrematureEndWhile(</span><span>2</span><span>, </span><span>1</span><span>)) </span><span>// we expect an error on line 2, character 1

</span></code></pre>
<p>These will of course fail:</p>

<p>We haven't actually implemented any bracket-matching behavior, so the parser just keeps producing "valid" lists of instructions wrapped in the <code>Ok</code> variant of Rust's <code>Result</code>. Because we're <code>expect</code>ing an <code>err</code>or, this fails our test. What we want is error data that contains the location of the mistake in the source code.</p>
<p>How could we do this? Well, you see, early on in uni I had this one guy teach one of my courses. He was probably a better researcher than he was a teacher, as he was openly rude to his students and didn't really care to explain anything. His default answer to any question was "it's all in The Book", and his favorite joke was letting someone muddle their way through an exercise, nod along and encourage them, then, when they finished, proclaiming smugly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, this is all completely wrong. Go read the relevant chapter at home, class is over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking back on it, he was kind of an asshole. Or maybe he was going through hard times, but that would mean I don't get to be self-righteous and talk smack about him.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Last year I published my first book with a publisher, <a href="https://handsonbughunting.com/"><em>Hands on Bug Hunting For Penetration Testers</em></a>.</p>

<p>Going in, I was determined to set up a workflow that would allow me to:</p>

<p>1) Keep a backup of the book.<br>
2) Allow me to easily track my writing progress.<br>
3) Work on the book offline.<br>
4) Keep my own copy of the book.</p>

<p>What set of tools could possibly control the versioning, backup, access control, and portability of plain text?</p>

<p>I had all the tools in front of me - and had already started using them. I could use a git repo to keep a backup of the book and track changes, using Unix tools like <code>wc</code>, <code>cat</code>, <code>ag</code> (basically a faster <code>grep</code>) and others to accomplish everything I needed to - in a workflow I was already comfortable with.</p>

<p>It was tooling kismet.</p>

<h2 id="layout">Layout</h2>

<p>Here’s how the book repo is laid out.</p>

<pre><code>book/
    code/
    docs/
    manuscript/
    promotions/
    cover.jpg
    outline.md
    review-notes.md
    technical-instructions.md
</code></pre>

<p>The directories should be pretty self-explanatory and, as you can tell, deal with more than just the immediate manuscript. <code>promotions</code> lets me keep track of guest blog ideas, content strategy campaigns, and tactics I’m coordinating together with my publisher’s marketing team. <code>code</code> is all my code (surprise!) Although I haven’t found it necessary yet to program a solution for inlining the code snippets, yet (I just copy them over), it could definitely be done.
<code>docs</code> is for research I’m compiling in the course of writing the book, so I can ensure everything is properly cited, and I can pull in the original document for my publisher to inspect if they want to know the source of an idea, statistic, graph, or other quoted resource.</p>

<p>The files are also pretty direct. <code>outline.md</code> is an outline, <code>review-notes.md</code> is a file where I keep <em>my</em> notes on <em>my publishers</em> notes, thinking in text about how to shape the book using their suggested edits. <code>technical-instructions.md</code> is where I’ve kept any extra-textual instructions on setup and troubleshooting, for the technical editor to review, and the <code>cover.jpg</code> is, well, the cover.</p>

<h2 id="the-manuscript">The Manuscript</h2>

<p>But let’s take a deeper dive into the meatiest part of this setup - the actual <code>manuscript</code>.</p>

<pre><code>book/
    code/
    docs/
    manuscript/
        Preface.txt
        Assessment.txt
        Ch1_Introduction.txt
        Ch2_Choosing_Your_Hunting_Ground.txt
        Ch3_Preparing_for_an_Engagement.txt
        Ch4_Unsanitized_Data_A_Case_Study_in_XSS.txt
        Ch5_SQLi_Code_Injection_and_Scanners.txt
        Ch6_CSRF_and_Insecure_Session_Authentication.txt
        Ch7_XML_External_Entities_XXE.txt
        Ch8_Access_Control_and_Security_through_Obscurity.txt
        Ch9_Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Social_Engineering.txt
        Ch10_Framework_and_Application-Specific_Vulnerabilities.txt
        Ch11_Formatting_your_Report.txt
        Ch12_Other_Tools.txt
        Ch13_Other_(Out-of-Scope)_Vulnerabilities.txt
        Ch14_Going_Further.txt
        images/
    promotions/
    cover.jpg
    outline.md
    review-notes.md
    technical-instructions.md
</code></pre>

<p>Flat is better than nested, always. Rather than have chapter directories and possibly keeping images together, I went this route so that I could keep this nice at-a-glance view.</p>

<p>You might be noticing though - why use the <code>txt</code> file extension here but not in other files like <code>review-notes.md</code>, where I use the <code>md</code>? That’s because of a simple wrapper I wrote out around <code>wc</code>. I call it <code>txt</code> and keep it symlinked as a command under <code>/usr/local/bin/txt</code>.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

total=0

for FILE in `find . -type f -name "*.txt"`

do
    wc -w $FILE
    words=`wc -w &lt; $FILE | tr -d ' '`
    total=$(($total + $words))
done

printf "%'d" $total

echo " words
</code></pre>

<p>All this does is add the word count returned by <code>wc</code> and show the total word count of all the <code>.txt</code> files under the path where the command is called, with a file-by-file breakdown As you can see, it only targets <code>.txt</code> files, so using that convention we can keep <code>.md</code> out of the count.</p>

<p>How about <code>images</code>? For that directory I try to use its own naming convention:</p>

<pre><code>arachni-cli-sqli.png                      
arachni-help.png                          
arachni-html-report.png                   
arachni-sqli-timing-attack-part-two.png   
arachni-sqli-timing-attack.png
</code></pre>

<p>There’s no formal convention of chapter-topic-modifier (next time!) but even just grouping common images under compatible topic buckets everything together in an alphabetically-sorted view, and makes it easier to navigate. And because the <code>images</code> are in the <code>manuscript</code> directory, right alongside the individual chapters, referencing an image in a chapter looks like:</p>

<pre><code>![alt image text](/images/some-image-path.png)
</code></pre>

<p>Coincidentally (or not) the layout of my Hugo blog allows me to use this exact syntax and path reference.</p>



<p>So what do I use to take advantage of this all-markdown, all-the-time workflow? A few things</p>

<h3 id="sublime-text-markdownediting-markdownpreview">Sublime Text + MarkdownEditing + MarkdownPreview</h3>

<p>Sublime Text has a couple of great plugins for working with Markdown. Together, these two plugins give you syntax highlighting, a better background / text theme, centers the text, and allows you to use a shortcut to preview the document in your browser.</p>

<h3 id="bat">Bat</h3>

<p>Do you use <code>bat</code>? You should. A “cat clone with wings,” it provides beautiful syntax highlighting, <code>less</code>, and a bunch of other goodies, while also acting as a direct drop-in for <code>cat</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2ea95c30ed625376e3f345df019f4bdf0079a71e/c94a8/images/bat-highlighting.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="ag">Ag</h3>

<p><code>ag</code> is just a faster <code>grep</code>, basically - and having access to quick, easy, full-text search functionality is key. Being able to easily answer questions like “When have a previously referenced OWASP?” in order to avoid repeating myself, or get a quick refresher on how much background I’d given or what I’d already covered, is great.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/841bd5a3f8e3cc92f6ae3526c4271515d888f781/dd196/images/ag-example.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="write">Write</h3>

<p>I paid for the <a href="https://writeapp.co/">Write app</a> a few years ago to try it out, and though I’ve moved on to Sublime Text, I keep it for it’s greate translation ability. Using it I can convert a markdown file to a <code>pdf</code>, <code>doc</code>, <code>rtf</code>, or other common format.</p>

<h3 id="anything-really">Anything, Really</h3>

<p>There’s so much more I could incorporate into the workflow that I haven’t already. Maybe I could set it up so that if I didn’t push a commit of a certain size in a certain period to Github, I’d get a Slack reminder - or use my plain text corpus to create a NN that would try to autocomplete my writing in my own voice. The sky’s the limit! Using the plain-text, markdown-first approach opens up the possible ecosystem to include pretty much anything in the Unix mold.</p>

<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>

<p>Using this workflow I get all the advantages a programmer does with code - a robust version history, a repo back up system (through strategic use of <code>remotes</code>), easy collaboration (add your editor as a github collaborator), and I don’t get locked into any proprietary formats, or rely on some third-party online editor where I fundamentally don’t control what I’m writing.</p>

<p>And I get the portability of markdown! Though my publisher, Packt, requires you to use an online CMS to write books with them, it lacks some of the tooling I need (and has the always-online problem). But because it also uses / supports markdown through a combination markdown/WYSIWYG system, all I have to do is copy and paste each chapter in as I finish it.</p>

<h2 id="parting-thoughts">Parting Thoughts</h2>

<p>The beauty of this system is that you can transpose it onto just about anything. If you write a blog using a static site generator (like I am), then you’re probably already formatting your posts as markdown files under a <code>posts</code> or similar folder.</p>

<p>When all long-form writing projects (documentation, books, blog posts) can use the same system, you get a beautiful convergence of tools that lets you <em>just write</em>, without getting hung up on which particular solution (Word, Google Docs, flat file) fits what particular content.</p>

        <h2 itemprop="headline">Names to avoid in Software Engineering</h2>
        <p itemprop="about"><i>An incomplete list of poor names for libraries, modules, projects and teams</i></p>
        <p>
        by  on <i itemprop="datePublished">2021-01-24</i></p>
        <p><span itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>There's an old joke that says the two hardest problems in Computer Science are
cache invalidation, naming things and off-by-one errors. Now, giving good names
is as much an art as a science, and there are many different schools of advice.
When it comes to variable and function naming, <a href="https://www.lysator.liu.se/c/pikestyle.html">Rob Pike's notes on C
Style</a> capture the essential goals
of good naming practice. However, the Tao of Naming is going to be a contentious
topic, and I have no interest in opening that can of worms today.</p>

<p>Names that stink, however, are much easier to spot. Here is an incomplete list
of names that should give you pause if you ever encounter them in the wild. Some
of these bad names you can fix with just a simple commit. Some of these names
indicate a much deeper problem, that will require you to investigate whether the
object that bears that name should actually exist as one object at all, or if it
must be refactored or reorg into different units.</p>

<h2>File under M for Misc</h2>

<p>Most programming languages offer developers a way to group collections of
similar functions and types into software packages or modules. For some
programmers, the ability to have a place to put code that's shared in one place
is all that they want from this feature, and they approach code organization
with the same amount of thought as their second-from-the-bottom kitchen drawer.</p>

<p>This is why you end up with software modules with names like:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>utils</code></li>
<li><code>lib</code></li>
<li><code>tools</code></li>
<li><code>misc</code></li>
<li><code>etc</code></li>
<li><code>common</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever I see <code>common</code>, I'm very tempted to commit additional packages named
<code>rare</code>, <code>epic</code> and <code>legendary</code>, and have the contents of each of them be just:</p>

<pre><code># You must reach a higher level to use this code
</code></pre>

<p>There's nothing wrong with putting code in a misc place <em>temporarily</em>, while you
work on it. But when you find that the code is already being reused by different
components in your project, it's time to put a little effort into categorizing
what those <code>tools</code> you're stuffing into the drawer are, so that other developers
know to look in there when they need it.</p>

<h2>The ThingDoer is a thing that does something</h2>

<p>When developers adopt design patterns they picked up from textbooks, college
classes or blogs, we can sometimes forget to make the name relevant to the
codebase or task at hand. Perhaps the developers put in a little more
abstraction than they should have into the code. Or, there might be a class that
could just have been a function or a for-loop. This is where we run into the
category of <code>ThingDoer</code> names, like:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Executor</code></li>
<li><code>Manager</code></li>
<li><code>Visitor</code></li>
<li><code>Transformer</code></li>
<li><code>Factory</code></li>
<li><code>SyncService</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Such names might be appropriate for superclasses and interfaces but are not
great matches for business logic. If these classes genuinely need to exist, at
least consider including more context about what ThingDoer does, or how it does
it, in the name.</p>

<h2>Watch out, I'm using Computer Science!</h2>

<p>My conjecture is that developers with an academic background are susceptible to
the trap of naming classes after concepts in computer science. Classwork focuses
on teaching core abstract data types, without introducing any real-world
embellishments. However, in real-world situations the fact that your
<code>LibraryBook</code>s are a <code>Node</code> in a <code>Graph</code> is often less important than the fact
that they are <code>LibraryBook</code>s.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>-Data</code></li>
<li><code>-Info</code></li>
<li><code>Entity</code></li>
<li><code>Set</code></li>
<li><code>Node</code></li>
<li><code>Graph</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Everything is data. I haven't thought through whether I agree with that
statement philosophically. However, when you're programming, <em>everything is data</em>.
Therefore, adding the word <code>Data</code> or <code>Info</code> at the end of a class or variable
name is free of any semantic content.</p>

<p>Similarly, any references between objects in your programs will form a graph, by
definition. Is there something specifically Graph-y about your class, so that
everyone needs to be reminded every time they type it? In the instance of a
purpose-built graph library, that is definitely the case. For the rest of us, we
can name our <code>PetNetworkGraph</code> simply <code>PetNetwork</code>, or even more tersely,
<code>Pets</code>.</p>

<h2>Coordination problems</h2>

<p>Communication and coordination is one of the hardest parts of getting a single
group to do something new, and that is especially true for engineering. This
effect compounds drastically as the number of groups involved grows. The next
names are not specifically bad names, but signify projects that should be
treated with care.</p>

<ul>
<li>Project Voltron</li>
<li>Megazord</li>
<li>Any musical supergroup</li>
<li>Any project named after an Anime mecha that combines into a bigger mecha</li>
</ul>

<p>These names are usually attached to an effort requiring multiple (more than two)
separate teams to coordinate in some deep way. Perhaps the goal is to bring each
of several teams on legacy platforms onto the new standard software. Or maybe
these teams now all need to share data, and build pair-wise data integrations
between all of them. You can probably think of a few examples yourself.</p>

<p>Just like the Power Rangers, this project can succeed if it is run with
teamwork, strong leadership and technical maturity. Nevertheless be on your
guard when you see a Project Voltron.</p>

<h2>This team has an unspecified goal</h2>

<p>The final category I want to touch on today is something that I don't yet fully
understand myself. Engineering organizations of a sufficient size naturally
break into sub-teams that are tasked with specific business functions.
Sometimes, among them, we find a team who is meant to be "closest to the code",
the "most technical of them all". They are responsible for a grab bag of things,
such as developer experience, code standards, performance and libraries. And
they are usually called something like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Platform team</li>
<li>Core team</li>
<li>Core Platform Team (true story)</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't quite know what to make of this team. I've worked on a few Platform
teams myself, and my experience there has generally been very pleasant.</p>

<p>However, <a href="https://danverbraganza.com/writings/the-phoenix-project">The Phoenix Project</a>, changed my
thinking around how engineering teams deliver value. Rather than committing to
large pre-planned projects, it is better to deliver value in small increments.
No value has been created until something is in the hands of a customer, and
so-called Work in Progress represents a large liability on the sheets of the
business.</p>

<p>Based on this, I've now grown skeptical of whether confining engineering talent
to work on "the Platform" without specific business objectives is wise.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/">Don't Call Yourself a
Programmer</a>, Patrick McKenzie quotes Peter Drucker on the difference between Profit
Centres and Cost Centres. In every business, some parts of the organization
directly make the money, and the rest of the business spends money, supporting
them. Patrick admonishes professionals to be attached to the former rather than
the latter.</p>

<p>I am concerned that Platform Teams generally read as cost centers to outsiders.
Even if the Platform Team delivers a piece of technology that is critical for a
product launch, the product team is the one getting the shout-out at all hands.
This is why I am tentatively adding Core Platform Team as another name to
avoid.</p>

Today it's well-suited to people with a side project, that's fine, it doesn't need to address a large market on day one.

The leap of faith we need to make is that there will be an Etsy or Shopify movement and that you can dramatically grow the market for people wanting to build a full-time business out of their side hustle and that some of these businesses will grow large (but that some percentage won't outgrow and leave the platform).

I don't think you're on the path to building full-on enterprise software, nor do I think you should be, but it means that there need to be significantly more small pure software products that want to transform into a small business. This is totally possible but I don't have conviction around that market today."</p><h3 data-id="7b0d8c1b4a96453f8c8615d6d5a9c5d3"><a href="#7b0d8c1b4a96453f8c8615d6d5a9c5d3" title="Index Ventures"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.indexventures.com/">Index Ventures</a></h3><p>"You're in a great area code but you need to be headed towards a specific address."</p><h3 data-id="b66e0bb209ef418bb79e365b2671758e"><a href="#b66e0bb209ef418bb79e365b2671758e" title="Earnest Capital"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://earnestcapital.com/">Earnest Capital</a></h3><p>"Your target customers may be bootstrappers, but what Saasify's trying to do as a platform is much larger and therefore a better fit for traditional VC."</p><h3 data-id="7bc741ab42754f6eaaec3c38e75a7857"><a href="#7bc741ab42754f6eaaec3c38e75a7857" title="SaaS Group"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://saas.group/">SaaS Group</a></h3><p>"Saasify is not worth much if it doesn’t have paying customers.

But what early stage VCs really care about is the size of your initial target market, since trying to build a solution that would apply to all of SaaS is pretty vague and difficult to imagine how you'd get there. </p><p>Stripe is a great example of an index company which fundamentally enables a significant chunk of online payments and SaaS. Saasify, on the other hand, provides a go-to-market solution for developer-oriented SaaS APIs.</p><p>It's pretty difficult for me to imagine Saasify's path to $100M revenue, which is the VC litmus test for whether or not an idea is worth their time. There are definitely some new-age VCs like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://earnestcapital.com/">Earnest Capital</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.indie.vc/">Indie VC</a> that are looking to change this mindset by focusing on profitability over growth, but ultimately my goal with Saasify was more aligned with the traditional VC model of building a high-growth, high-impact company to solve a problem at scale.</p><p>The core problem I had set out to solve with Saasify was helping developers go independent.</p><p>And after several pivots, I ended up with a solution that didn't really solve the original problem that I cared about. It definitely had some early signs of traction, but no real signs of revenue traction or growth potential due to the quality of Micro SaaS products that we attracted.</p><div><p><span role="img" aria-label="⭐">⭐</span></p><p><b><em>I'm currently working to transition Saasify to a more open, community-led platform.</em></b>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>UPDATE: Since this blew up 1. I wrote this mostly in response <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/how-wallstreetbets-pushed-gamestop-shares-to-the-moon">this article in Bloomberg</a>. 2. If you want to follow me on Twitter for more hot takes on internet culture and marketing stuff you can do that here: <a href="https://twitter.com/JeromySonne">@jeromysonne</a></p>



<p>I want to preface all of this by saying I am not an investing expert. I currently hold no publicly traded companies’ stock. (Though I might I haven’t logged into Robinhood in a while). What I am pretty good at though is internet culture and understanding communities through that lens. I also don’t agree with the Wallstreetbets culture. I’m just trying to explain it.</p>



<p>The recent dramatic fall and meteoric rise of Gamestop via the short squeeze that happened has a lot of technical reasons that people a lot better at finance can explain. What keeps coming up though is Wallstreetbets and their hand in taking a stock that seemed doomed to failure and rocketing it to new heights. I’m seeing a lot of well-meaning takes on their role that generally miss the “why” of the community and what it does / how it exists. After reading a well-written article in Bloomberg (that ultimately misses the point on WSB). I thought I would take a moment to give some insights.</p>



<p>References to tendies, autism, gay bears, and a bunch of other things don’t really make a lot of sense on the surface (and some make even less sense once you dive in). The culture of Wallstreetbets is an interesting one, to say the least, that has a lot of its language and customs rooted in 4chan. As 4chan users have grown up, migrated to other corners of the internet, and spread their language it’s continued on and evolved in different spaces. You saw a lot of this with the_donald on Reddit a few years ago before it was banned and a lot of similar overlap in language between what the community was and what WSB is now. (Twitter is so late to the party compared to Reddit).</p>



<p>The basic surface-level story of WSB is this. It’s a bunch of autistic losers that live in their mom’s basement who are gambling what little money they have to try and become rich to live lifestyles of hedonism. Since they are basement dwellers their obvious food of choice is chicken tenders aka tendies that they trade in their GBPs (Good boy points) to their mom so they can get more. In this world, they earn good boy points by doing well at stocks.</p>



<p>On the surface, it seems really weird but it’s mostly a type of gallows humor that permeates a lot of especially young millennials and zennial men. That nothing really means anything, that no one cares about them (or in some cases actively hate them), and so they reject buying in on the society they feel actively scorns them. I’ll resist the urge to add my personal opinions or quote Fight Club here, but I’m mostly saying all this to get you in their head.</p>



<p>As someone that deals with some (in the grand scheme of things minor) mental health issues around panic attacks and anxiety attacks the “Fuck it if nothing means anything I may as well do what I want” attitude on a self-destructive and nihilistic level makes sense to me. It’s not logical but it makes sense. If nothing means anything you may as well do what you want and try and have some fun before the existential crisis of death takes us all. To do that though you need cash, and most of us are slammed with student debt, increased COL, and stagnant wages as compared to our parents’ generation. All the “boomer” advice we’re given doesn’t really make sense especially when it comes to the dreaded value investing that we’re told to do when it comes to stocks especially in light of the financial crisis in 2008.</p>



<p>See back in the day if you played the rules, worked the job, saved the money you could mostly live a pretty good life. The system was there and it had your back you just had to play by the rules. At some point that changed. Understanding that fundamentally you can do “everything right” and be totally fucked anyways, never able to achieve your dreams regardless of what you do or don’t do is a shitty feeling. Along comes WSB.</p>



<p>Suddenly, there’s a chance. Not a big one, but a chance to get out of your situation and live the life you want. You can do everything right and never be able to retire anyway, OR you can take super speculative positions in the stock market by making giant bets on risky options that, if you happen to be right, could make you rich. You’ve broken the cycle and you can live the life you want. Worst case? You’re right back where you started.</p>



<p>““<strong>If you owe</strong>&nbsp;your bank a hundred pounds,&nbsp;<strong>you have a problem</strong>. But&nbsp;<strong>if you owe</strong>&nbsp;a million,&nbsp;<strong>it</strong>&nbsp;has.” – Big Daddy Keyne$</p>



<p>I think there are really 2 things you need to understand about WSB (And really this piece of internet culture in general). It’s 50% depression and 50% a Molotov cocktail. You either win and get out or you lose AND you’re sticking it to the man at the same time. Even if I go super long, ratchet up the leverage, and take a big bet and lose guess what?</p>



<p>Nothing.</p>



<p>Seriously nothing. Most of these people are in hopeless debt with no clear path out anyway. They declare bankruptcy and move on. They took the bet, rode the adrenaline rush, and they lost. The silver lining? The elites that hate them are stuck paying the bill. It’s really a win-win situation. The memes, the culture, all of it really stems from this attitude.</p>



<p>I think it’s honestly fascinating that people are finally starting to notice this sub-culture once it’s begun affecting the mainstream financial system. Maybe now that it’s hitting these folks where they live, hurting the only thing they care about, they’ll start thinking about why these people are acting out. That maybe if they felt they had more of a stake in the future, that wealth inequality wasn’t so bad, that they’ll never afford a home, etc. they wouldn’t feel the need to act out. That if they weren’t in such an unwinnable situation they wouldn’t feel the need to throw Molotov cocktails through the front window of the country and the global financial system.</p>



<p>I doubt it, but one can hope.</p>



<p>Until then this is going to get worse, not better.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><p><span>Retro computing platforms all feature some form of a keyboard. In the very early days of home computing, the keyboard differentiated the computers from each other. Later, as applications became more sophisticated, the mouse became the next significant input device to catch-on. Early 8-bit machines from Atari, Commodore, and even Apple all had a mouse interface. However, like other peripherals at the time, they were not compatible with each other. Today's retro computer enthusiast may have a hard time finding a functional mouse for their favorite platform. Sold by </span><a href="https://twitter.com/RetrohaxN" rel="nofollow">Retrohax</a><span>, the </span><a href="https://retrohax.net/the-mouster-project-is-here/" rel="nofollow">mouSTer is a universal modern USB-to-retro mouse adapter</a><span>.</span></p><blockquote>"It all started with an idea to create the most convenient modern USB mouse adapter for as many retro machines as possible."</blockquote><p>Early mice usually featured a DB9-interface, but that interface was not always compatible across platforms. A mouse designed for an Atari Falcon may not work on the Commodore 64. The mouSTer handles those translations. Additionally, it serves as the USB HID host needed to enable a modern mouse. Before mouSTer, retro-mouse adapters tended to favor the older PS/2-style mice. Few mice sold today still have that legacy protocol.</p><p>Retrohax says that nearly every modern mouse they've tested works with the adapter. Advanced features like RGB LEDs could technically be supported, but there is doubt that the retro computers supply enough current for those modern features. In terms of another limitation, there is not support for PC serial mice. Computers like a Commodore 64 expect a pair of analog signals from the mouse. Serial mice on the PC were RS-232 / digital devices.</p><figure></figure><p>MouSTer firmware updates happen via a USB flash drive. A couple of files on the drive allow mouSTer to reflash or reconfigure itself. Today mouse emulation modes default to Amiga, Atari ST, and game pad. The expectation is the adapter should work with Amiga 3000, the Atari XL/XE series, and the Commodore C64 and C128.</p><p><span>Getting a case for mouSTer has been an issue. Injection molding is not an option because it would cause the USB-connector to become filled with plastic. Retrohax has plans to release STL files so that users can 3d print a case. The first batch of 220 units is for sale on the </span><a href="https://retrohax.net/shop/amiga/mouster/" rel="nofollow">Retrohax web store</a><span>, with a plan to produce another batch based on demand. Currently, the price is 116 PLN Polish Zloty, which is about 31 USD.</span></p></div></section></div>]]>

            <p>Artificial Intelligence must be subject to human control, allowing humans to correct or disable it in case of unforeseen behaviour, say MEPs.</p>

            <div><p><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The report, adopted on Wednesday with 364 votes in favour, 274 against, 52 abstentions, calls for an EU legal framework on AI with definitions and ethical principles, including its military use. It also calls on the EU and its member states to ensure AI and related technologies are human-centred (i.e. intended for the service of humanity and the common good).</p>

<p><strong>Military use and human oversight</strong></p>

<p>MEPs stress that human dignity and human rights must be respected in all EU defence-related activities. AI-enabled systems must allow humans to exert meaningful control, so they can assume responsibility and accountability for their use.</p>
<p>The use of lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) raises fundamental ethical and legal questions on human control, say MEPs, <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-8-2018-0341_EN.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterating their call</a> for an EU strategy to prohibit them as well as a ban on so-called â€œkiller robotsâ€�. The decision to select a target and take lethal action using an autonomous weapon system must always be made by a human exercising meaningful control and judgement, in line with the principles of proportionality and necessity.</p>
<p>The text calls on the EU to take a leading role in creating and promoting a global framework governing the military use of AI, alongside the UN and the international community.</p>

<p><strong>AI in the public sector</strong></p>
<p>The increased use of AI systems in public services, especially healthcare and justice, should not replace human contact or lead to discrimination, MEPs assert. People should always be informed if they are subject to a decision based on AI and be given the option to appeal it.</p>
<p>When AI is used in matters of public health, (e.g. robot-assisted surgery, smart prostheses, predictive medicine), patientsâ€™ personal data must be protected and the principle of equal treatment upheld. While the use of AI technologies in the justice sector can help speed up proceedings and take more rational decisions, final court decisions must be taken by humans, be strictly verified by a person and be subject to due process.</p>

<p><strong>Mass surveillance and deepfakes </strong></p>
<p>MEPs also warn of threats to fundamental human rights and state sovereignty arising from the use of AI technologies in mass civil and military surveillance. They call for public authorities to be banned from using â€œhighly intrusive social scoring applicationsâ€� (for monitoring and rating citizens). The report also raises concerns over â€œdeepfake technologiesâ€� that have the potential to â€œdestabilise countries, spread disinformation and influence electionsâ€�. Creators should be obliged to label such material as â€œnot originalâ€� and more research should be done into technology to counter this phenomenon.</p>
<p><br><strong>Quote</strong></p>
<p>Rapporteur <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/124738/GILLES_LEBRETON/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gilles Lebreton (ID, FR)</a> said: â€œFaced with the multiple challenges posed by the development of AI, we need legal responses. To prepare the Commissionâ€™s legislative proposal on this subject, this report aims to put in place a framework which essentially recalls that, in any area, especially in the military field and in those managed by the state such as justice and health, AI must always remain a tool used only to assist decision-making or help when taking action. It must never replace or relieve humans of their responsibilityâ€�.</p>

<h6 id="h6183003">Update January 26. 2021: I received some feedback that people would be interested in more details of the reasons, why the React build process is so complicated, because, well, it is the title of this post. So, I added some more to the "Comparison and reasons" section and the "Conclusion"
    </h6>


    </div>
<p>Have you ever tried to share a freshly designed UI-component as a library? Recently, I was creating some <a href="https://gradientdescent.de/descent-ripple/">ripple-effect animations</a> in <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> and decided to publish them in a library. It is neatly compiled with all the runtime, so it can be used without Svelte. To target the large audience of React developers, I also wrote a convenient <a href="https://gradientdescent.de/react-descent-ripple/">React wrapper component</a> for it. At first, I thought this would be an easy task, but the build process turned out to be harder than I thought. So, I want to share my experience. I will show a simpler example here, so let' go:
    </p>
<h2 id="h2549518">The project
    </h2>

<p>Let's assume, we want to share a simple component, which wraps Html content into a
    </p>
<p>Rocket     
      </p>
<p>The rocket is just a div, which has the borders styled in an unusual way with simple css. It is just a toy example, but I want to do this with React and Svelte, so let's start with the basic steps in Svelte:
    </p>
<h3 id="h3325710">Svelte
    </h3>

<p>To start, create a folder <code><code>svelte-div-rocket</code></code> and in it run
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>npm init</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>and answer the questions to generate a package.json file. As <code><code>"main"</code></code> choose <code><code>"Rocket.svelte"</code></code> and then go ahead and create this file. For this example, I do not bother creating subfolders, for larger projects this would not be wise. Here is the content I put in the <code><code>"Rocket.svelte"</code></code>:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>&lt;!--</span><span> </span></span>

    </pre>
<p>Let me explain: first, we have a comment bracket <code><code>&lt;!--... --&gt;</code></code> where the component is documented. Then there is the script, where we export a single prop <code><code>direction</code></code>. In the style element, we declare 4 CSS classes, one for each facing direction. And finally, the Html section has a div, where the class is picked based on the direction prop, and we got a slot so that we can add children into the rocket.
    </p>
<p>What else is to say about the component library? Not much, actually. We could add more information to the package.json, a README.md, and a license file, if we wanted to, or we could already publish this to npm. In a Svelte project, we can (after installation, obviously) use the component with
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>// Somecomponent.svelte</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;script&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    import Rocket  from 'svelte-div-rocket';</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/script&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;</span><span>Rocket</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    some text</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Rocket</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>That's it for Svelte.
    </p>
<h3 id="h3616801">React
    </h3>

<p>Let's try the same process. Create a folder <code><code>react-div-rocket</code></code>, run <code><code>npm init</code></code>, answer questions with <code><code>"main":"Rocket.jsx"</code></code>, create this file and put this in:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>// Rocket.jsx</span></span>
<span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>react</span><span>'</span><span>;</span></span>

<span><span>    )</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>

<span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>Rocket</span><span>;</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>Also, create a file <code><code>rocket.css</code></code> where the 4 classes from the Svelte style tag are placed. When I try to use it from a project started with <code><code>create-react-app</code></code> the following error appears:
    </p>
<blockquote><div><p>&gt;</p>
        <p>../react-div-rocket/rocket.jsx 8:8<br>
Module parse failed: Unexpected token (8:8)<br>
You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type, currently no loaders are configured to process this file. See <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">https://webpack.js.org</a>
    </p></div>
      
    </blockquote>
<p>It tells me, you can't have .jsx files in a library unless you have an extra webpack loader. The loader would have to be part of the app project, not the library, so it is no option to demand the users of our rocket library to install it. Instead, we have to transpile the jsx into plain js.
    </p>
<p>In this case, we could do this by hand or with the <a href="https://babeljs.io/repl/#?browsers=defaults%2C%20not%20ie%2011%2C%20not%20ie_mob%2011&amp;build=&amp;builtIns=false&amp;spec=false&amp;loose=false&amp;code_lz=GYVwdgxgLglg9mABACwKYBt1wBQEpEDeAUIogE6pQhlIA8AJjAG4B8AEhlogO5xnr0AhLQD0jVgG4iAXyJA&amp;debug=false&amp;forceAllTransforms=false&amp;shippedProposals=false&amp;circleciRepo=&amp;evaluate=false&amp;fileSize=false&amp;timeTravel=false&amp;sourceType=module&amp;lineWrap=true&amp;presets=react&amp;prettier=false&amp;targets=&amp;version=7.12.12&amp;externalPlugins=">Babel online transpiler</a>, since we just need to arrive here:

    </pre>
<p>In general, this is a tedious process, so let's start over and try a streamlined version.
First, delete the package.json. Then run
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>npx create-react-library</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>and answer all the questions. Depending on your computer and internet connection speed, you'll have time to grab some coffee. Small recap, the ready-to-use Svelte library has 2 files and uses <strong>~2 kB
    </strong> disk space, and has zero dependencies. To be fair, it does not have a test environment, an example app, or TypeScript linting and transpiling. The React folder has all that now. It takes about <strong>397 MB
    </strong> (<strong>420 MB
    </strong> with TypeScript template) of disk space and the node_modules folder has <strong>1087
    </strong> (<strong>1096
    </strong> with TypeScript) subfolders. It has no "normal" dependencies, but <strong>19
    </strong> dev-dependencies (<strong>29
    </strong> with TypeScript) and 1 peer-dependency (react).
    </p>
<p>It should be easy enough to adjust the template with our rocket component. Or is it not? Copy over the <code><code>Rocket.jsx</code></code> code to src/index.js, copy <code><code>rocket.css</code></code> into the src folder and build the library with the <code><code>npm run build</code></code> command. Then import the component into some app. And et voilà, nothing happens. Well, at least if the React version of the library and your project matches. If not, you get an error.
    </p>
<blockquote><div><p>&gt;</p>
        <p>Quick fix: update both React versions or simply delete the React folder in the node_modules folder in our rocket library.
    </p></div>
      
    </blockquote>
<p>Assuming that there are no more errors, why are we not seeing any rockets? First, note that our CSS classes end up in <code><code>dist/index.css</code></code> but they are renamed during the build process. If we want to style something with our class 'uplookingrocket', we would need to write something like this:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>styles</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>./rocket.css</span><span>'</span><span>;</span></span>

<span><span>&lt;p</span><span> </span><span>className</span><span>={</span><span>styles</span><span>[</span><span>"</span><span>uplookingrocket</span><span>"</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>Adjust our code accordingly aaaand..... still nothing. You can find the reason by looking into the <code><code>Example/App.js</code></code>. There is the following line:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>react-div-rocket/dist/index.css</span><span>'</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>That means, in the app, we have to import the component <strong>and
    </strong> the CSS file. Maybe that makes sense from a technical perspective since React/Webpack wants to bundle CSS into a single file, but from a user perspective, this is rather inconvenient. For our little project, it even questions, whether it makes sense at all. The "magic" happens in CSS, so we could only publish the CSS file in a library and let the user apply it to her Html elements.
    </p>
<h2 id="h295798">Comparison and reasons
    </h2>

<p>Both libraries work, at last. When you only look at the final results which are delivered to the consumer, <code><code>dist/index.js</code></code> and <code><code>dist/index.css</code></code> for React and <code><code>Rocket.svelte</code></code> for Svelte, there is no big difference in size and content. Why is the process to get there so different?<br>
React is much older than Svelte. It has a long history and along the way, it redefined itself and with it the way we look at web apps. The most popular way today is probably to create a bundled app with  <code><code>create-react-app</code></code>. It was not always clear that this would be the preferred operation mode by developers. It is also possible to run React completely from CDNs. This has the advantage that the React library is downloaded only once for all pages. This option explains why our library cannot contain jsx files: we can't know if the library is processed further or if it is directly called in the browser, and the browser does not understand jsx.
    </p>
<p>The Svelte developers on the other side could observe how the landscape of web development changed over time. Developers today transpile and bundle their apps anyway, so why not try to put the heavy lifting into the compile step? So, Svelte is a compiler. It does not have a heavy legacy backpack to carry around (yet?). It gathers all information when the final code is generated. Thus, we don't need to pre-process our library. Svelte condenses a lot that is good in React, but of course, it is much more. It has its own syntax and file type, it gets rid of the <code><code>virtual DOM</code></code> and instead <code><code>redefines reactivity</code></code>, and adds a lot of little helper gimmicks that make the life of a developer much easier.
    </p>
<p>Perhaps React shows the way, that Svelte might also go one day: Commit after commit new Ideas are added and more and more use-cases are covered. At the same time, the codebase grows, and complexity increases. Cutting back in features or supported …</p></div></div>

<p>Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral Space Port Sation, Florida — SpaceX made history again by sending a record number of 143 satellites on a single mission to the lower Earth orbit yesterday. The record was previously held by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) with 103 satellites on a single launch.</p>



<p>Among these were 10 SpaceX Starlink satellites that are deployed to the Polar Orbit (see animation below for explanation). This will make high-speed internet available in the most remote polar locations of our planet.</p>



<p>The SmallSat rideshare program by SpaceX enables customers in launching their satellites to low Earth orbit (LEO) with a budget as low as $1M. In this dedicated launch, most of the small satellites were of SpaceX customers, in the past, SpaceX has been making space for a small number of customer satellites with the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/06/14/falcon-9-starlink-launch-58/">Starlink constellation satellites.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a>‘s space exploration &amp; commercial spaceflight company has used optical laser-linking of the satellites for the first time. Musk has confirmed on Twitter that the black pipe-type objects at the end of each Starlink satellite are actually laser links. I have marked these objects in the following photo of the SmallSat satellite stack photo shared by SpaceX before the launch.</p>

<p>According to Musk, only the polar <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/starlink/">Starlink</a> satellites sent to orbit this year will have laser links, all the other Starlink satellites will get laser-linking feature next year. SpaceX has given the current laser-linked satellites a version number of v0.9, Musk explained.</p>

<h2>Why Laser Links?</h2>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=snoshy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">u/snoshy</a> provided much-needed insight on the use of ‘laser links’ on Starlink satellites as the article made it to the HN front page.</p>



<blockquote><p>These laser links are purely intended for satellite-to-satellite communications for Starlink. They are not (at least at this time, and for the foreseeable future) intended for ground-to-satellite communications.</p><p>The value that sat-to-sat laser links provide is that they create a low latency, high bandwidth path that stays within the Starlink satellite network. Before these 10 satellites, each Starlink satellite has only been capable of communicating directly to ground terminals (either consumer, transit or SpaceX control). For traffic that is intended to move large geographic distances (think transcontinental), this can require several hops back and forth between ground and space, or the traffic from the user terminal is exited at a node that is geared for transiting traffic and most of the data transits along with existing ground Internet links.</p><p>By performing this type of transit directly in space, and exiting at a transit node nearest the destination for the data, you greatly reduce latency. Bandwidth still might not be great, but what this does is unlocks a very financially lucrative consumer use case: low latency finance traffic and critical communications. </p><p>There are many use cases around the world where shaving even 10-20 milliseconds of latency on a data path can unlock finance and emergency capabilities, and this is a long-fought battle throughout the history of these industries. As an example, if you got a piece of news about a company in Australia, and wanted to trade on it as quickly as possible in the USA if you can beat your competitors by 10-20 milliseconds, that can mean a lot of money.</p><p>Laser comms for Starlink sats have long been planned, but have historically proven to be quite hard to get working.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="single-content-content"><p>There’s plenty of research on the impact fast food has on your health. For example:</p><p>"Today, eating processed foods and fast foods may kill more people prematurely than cigarette smoking."<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6146358/">The hidden dangers of fast and processed food</a>, American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine, Joel Fuhrman, MD.</p><p>"Just a few days of junk food could change your metabolism. A small <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.21031/abstract">study</a> of 12 healthy young men found eating junk food for just five days led to a reduced ability of their muscles to turn glucose into energy, even though they didn’t eat more calories as part of the study. Over the long term, this change could lead to insulin resistance and eventually type 2 diabetes."</p><p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/sneaking-a-little-junk-food-doesnt-mean-all-is-lost/2018/02/26/828b75fa-1b36-11e8-9de1-147dd2df3829_story.html">This is your body on fast food</a>, Washington Post</p><p>But we’ve never seen how fast food impacts the body in real-time, over 5 days. We decided to put it to the test with another N of 1 experiment (i.e. not a statistically significant sample size but interesting to do nonetheless).</p><p>Before we get into the data, some key metrics that Basis tracks and for you to follow along:</p><p><b>Fasting glucose:</b> This is the glucose test you're likely most familiar with. It's the test you do in the morning, after you've fasted for 8-10 hours. The normal range for blood glucose is 70 to 100 mg/dl (but values may vary for different labs). Levels between 100 and 126 mg/dl are referred to as impaired fasting glucose or pre-diabetes<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/diabetes_mellitus/article.htm"></a>. Diabetes <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/type_2_diabetes_pictures_slideshow/article.htm"></a>is typically diagnosed when fasting blood glucose levels are 126 mg/dl or higher. Basis acquires its data from a glucose sensor that measures glucose in the interstitial fluid - not in serum (blood). Measurements can vary up to 10-15% between the results you would get in a lab.</p><p><b>Time in range:</b> Minimizing the number of glucose spikes and more time spent in the optimal glucose range of 70-110 is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31127824">observed in healthy (non-diabetic) adults</a>. </p><p><b>Glucose variability:</b> Glucose variability is the amount of variation that you experience with your glucose throughout the day. Maintaining steadier glucose variation over time <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4543190/#:~:text=Glycemic%20variability%20(GV)%2C%20which,same%20time%20on%20different%20days.">leads to better health outcomes</a>. In healthy, non-diabetic adults, glucose variability targets are &lt;13%.</p><p><b>Heart rate variability (HRV): </b>HRV measures the beat-to-beat variations of your heart rate throughout the day. HRV provides insights into how your heartbeats change over time and is now a crucial measure of overall well-being and physical fitness.</p><p><b>Disclaimer:</b> We don’t recommend that anyone try eating fast food with every meal for a week. If you’re already doing it, we hope this post can have even the slightest of impact in helping you transition towards eating healthier. </p><p><b>Day 1</b></p><p>Loading Chart</p><p><u>Glucose</u></p><p>Low: 85 / Average: 102 / High: 144</p><p>Fasting glucose: 88</p><p>Time in range: 85.5%</p><p>Glucose variability: 13.12</p><p><u>Heart rate</u></p><p>Low: 49 / Average: 99 / High: 174</p><p>HRV: 36.69</p><p><u>Meals</u></p><p><i>Breakfast: </i>Starbucks coffee w/ milk and sugar + butter croissant.</p><p><i>Lunch:</i> Cheeseburger with fries and a beer.</p><p><i>Snacks: Cookies.</i></p><p><i>Dinner:</i> Pizza and a Coke.</p><p><b>Day 2</b></p><p>Loading Chart</p><p><u>Glucose</u></p><p>Low: 76 / Average: 103 / High: 142</p><p>Fasting glucose: 88</p><p>Time in range: 71%</p><p>Glucose variability: 11.82</p><p><u>Heart rate</u></p><p>Low: 51 / Average: 73 / High: 113</p><p>HRV: 17.66</p><p><i>Breakfast: </i>Starbucks coffee w/ milk and sugar + a chocolate croissant.</p><p><i>Lunch:</i> KFC nuggets w/ fries and a Coke.</p><p><i>Snacks:</i> Cookies.</p><p><i>Dinner: C</i>hicken in sweet sauce with fries and a 7up. </p><p><b>Day 3</b></p><p>Loading Chart</p><p>This was the worst day of the week.

My HRV was generally lower than normal, dropping from an average of ~35 to ~25.</p></li><li><p>My subjective well-being went down. I felt overall sluggish and unable to concentrate. And the reason is that every single fast food meal can narrow your arteries, leading to an increase in blood pressure. The quick spike in blood sugar can cause a surge in insulin, and then a quick drop in blood sugar. That leaves you feeling tired, cranky and hungry for more.  </p></li><li><p>Anecdotally, we heard from a number of people that this is the normal way they eat. If anything from my experience extrapolates to the average population, then there's no questioning why we have a diabetic epidemic. </p></li></ol><p>If you’re interested in seeing real-time data from a 3-day fast, check it out <a href="https://basishealth.io/blog/real-time-fasting-data-with-basis/">HERE</a>.</p><br><h3><b>Looking for a clearer view of your health?</b></h3><p><a href="https://basishealth.typeform.com/to/PVvE3guR">Sign up</a> for the Basis Early Access Beta and discover what having real-time access to your health data means. </p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Page speed and UX</strong> will be important forces that will take brands a few steps ahead in the digital race of 2021. So where exactly will you be in this race?</p><p>Powerful tasks offered by Screpy experts and comprehensive analysis reporting from a single point will enable you to track the speed of more projects in a more practical way. We will talk about the contribution of all these to SEO exactly now. Ready to get started?</p><h2>User Experience and Page Speed: You Are What You Offer!</h2><p>UX refers to the experience of a user who enters your website, depending on all factors, from colors, buttons, font to the general theme, content to site speed. Page speed determines how quickly users can access the content they request.</p><p>Now consider the web of the Internet where millions of different pages are ranked for each keyword. How likely are you to give a chance more than once to a site that loads very slowly or responds very slowly to your interactions?</p><p><em>Let’s say: not much</em>. Because there are websites with extremely rich content that will give you a perfect web experience by paying attention to UX on the internet. Moreover, this competition is valid for almost every sector.</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, web speed does not only affect e-commerce sites. Since e-commerce sites directly analyze behaviors such as adding a product to the chart or purchasing an item, the speed optimization of these sites is extremely valuable. However, the user who cannot get around through the categories even on a standard blog site becomes the user who will add +1 digits to the bounce rate tab in a short time.</p><p><strong><em>What does bounce rate mean</em>?</strong> Bounce rate refers to the rate of ‘’abandoning the website’’ of the user just before he or she enters it. As you can imagine, a website that is difficult to load or navigate between pages means a website with an increased bounce rate. So even if the traffic is high in the first process, low UX and low conversion negatively affect traffic and SEO over time.<br></p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="944" height="483" src="https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/speed-index.png" alt="Speed Index" srcset="https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/speed-index.png 944w,   https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/speed-index-300x153.png 300w,   https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/speed-index-768x393.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 944px) 100vw, 944px"></figure><h3>Page Speed Manages Brand Perception: Other Side of UX</h3><p>User Experience also includes how a user feels about your brand’s product or service.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember that a YSL user feels special and an Adidas user feels modern and powerful, right? That is what we called brand psychology. The values you attribute to your brand will also affect the experience your customers get from the brands’ products.</p><p><strong><em>Let’s meet a fact:&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p>A fast web page also affects your brand prestige in the eyes of the user. According to a study, especially when e-commerce site users experience situations such as freezing, crashing, taking too long to load, they prefer not to make a purchase from that site. Because this negative experience leaves the users an impression that the website they are on is not professional and competent enough.</p><p>Did that seem too striking to you? The bottom line is that this doesn’t just apply to buying behavior. Unless you support the user’s experience on your website with strong page speed rates, you will forgo the professional appearance of your platform.&nbsp;</p><p>After all, which professional platform would be too careless to take the necessary measures for page speed?</p><h3>There Is More To Talk About: Organic Search Rankings and Page Speed</h3><p>Now, we now know very well that page speed is in constant interaction with the following concepts:</p><ol><li>User experience</li><li>Bounce rate</li><li>SEO (Search engine optimization)</li><li>Purchasing behavior</li><li>Conversion rates</li><li>Organic traffic</li></ol><p>What about organic search engine rankings? Imagine trying to boost your website’s SERP rankings by doing search engine optimization. Better rankings will mean the following:</p><ul><li>Getting more visibility with less need for extra SEM budget,</li><li>To increase traffic organically,</li><li>Increasing brand recognition,</li><li>Increasing sales rates.</li></ul><p><strong><em>So, how does all this relate to SEO?</em></strong></p><p>Google cares that the websites it offers for its users are platforms with high performance and powerful UX. That’s why Google Pagespeed tries to predict the performance of websites using various metrics that measure speed.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="943" height="421" src="https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/performance-report.png" alt="Google Pagespeed Performance Metrics" srcset="https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/performance-report.png 943w,   https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/performance-report-300x134.png 300w,   https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/performance-report-768x343.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 943px) 100vw, 943px"><figcaption>Performance Insights</figcaption></figure><p>Would you like to take a look at how many seconds of page loading speed performances together create a theoretical UX? Let’s get started!</p><ul><li><strong>0.1 seconds</strong>: This number, which is one of the strongest page speed times, means a site that provides instant response. The user gets the chance to create a real interaction on such sites and gets the responses of the requested functions from the site very quickly.</li><li><strong>1 second</strong>: User experience will have a slightly lower score than the previous option. In this type of experience, the user realizes that he or she is waiting for a short time, but they consider this wait as trivial and continue to visit the site.</li><li><strong>10 seconds</strong>: Studies have found that the probability of the user to visit the site again decreases to even 75 percent in such page speed performances that require a long wait. Especially if this waiting takes place without any feedback, the brand image and user experience are damaged at the same time.</li></ul><h2>What About Visitor Behavior: UX, SEO, Conversion Rates</h2><p>How can the speed a user encounters when visiting a website somehow affect their SEO score? With Screpy, are you ready to grasp the area where these three concepts affect each other in a special feedback loop?</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="940" height="392" src="https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pagespeed-logo.png" alt="Google Pagespeed Logo" srcset="https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pagespeed-logo.png 940w,   https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pagespeed-logo-300x125.png 300w,   https://screpy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pagespeed-logo-768x320.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"></figure><h3>How does age speed performance affect user experience and SEO?</h3><p>The page speed performance of a site directly affects the user’s experience on the site. This experience causes judgments to be made about the brand’s reputation and easily finding what they are looking for. When these judgments arise, the user organizes subsequent website behavior. Also, page speed performance is an important metric that is evaluated directly within Google Insights, according to Google’s official statements.</p><h3>How is user experience is affected by page speed and how does it affect SEO?</h3><p>User experience varies depending on the page speed performance. A low performance means low UX. Low UX generates the user’s request to leave the site. This means that the bounce rate increases. A website with a high bounce rate will have a low SEO score.</p><h3>How is SEO affected by user experience and page speed?&nbsp;</h3><p>Low SEO score can be caused by low page speed values ​​or low UX scores. This prevents the web page from reaching high rankings in organic search result pages. This makes it difficult to attract user traffic to the website.

<p>I spent this week debug­ging an issue with an inter­nal web tool that our company’s sup­port team relies upon to pull up infor­ma­tion about our cus­tomers, mak­ing changes on their behalf to their sub­scrip­tions of the var­i­ous pack­ages and ser­vices that we offer. Try­ing to view one par­tic­u­lar cus­tomer — one! — would always crash the appli­ca­tion, leav­ing an unhelp­ful mes­sage that said, “Inter­nal Serv­er Error: Please con­tact the serv­er admin­is­tra­tor. More infor­ma­tion about this error may be avail­able in the serv­er error log.” Unfor­tu­nate­ly, there was only a sin­gle line in the log, “Error 500,” which only indi­cat­ed that yes, an error had hap­pened on the serv­er. No details from the application.</p>



<p>Luck­i­ly, this appli­ca­tion was writ­ten in Perl, an expres­sive pro­gram­ming lan­guage with a rich ecosys­tem of open-source libraries. It also has a built-in debug­ger mode that can run your pro­gram step by step, line by line. Any pro­gram that can be run from the text com­mand line can be paused, have its vari­ables and objects exam­ined, new code inter­ac­tive­ly entered, and then con­tin­ue its exe­cu­tion as if noth­ing had happened.</p>



<p>How­ev­er, this was a web appli­ca­tion that assumed it was run­ning in a web serv­er envi­ron­ment, and the customer’s infor­ma­tion was in our pro­duc­tion data­base, safe from pry­ing eyes (includ­ing curi­ous devel­op­ers like me) due to finan­cial com­pli­ance rules. I could not sim­ply run this pro­gram on my desk­top and repro­duce the prob­lem with this one cus­tomer — I had to some­how tease out more infor­ma­tion from a run­ning sys­tem and report it back using the only tool avail­able: the serv­er error log men­tioned above.</p>



<p>But still, the Perl debug­ger approach was appeal­ing. Could I some­how get the appli­ca­tion to log each line of code as it was exe­cut­ed? Could I then see what was run­ning the moment before it crashed, the offend­ing line print­ed in the log like a smok­ing gun that had just mur­dered its vic­tim? And assum­ing that the prob­lem was in our code and not in the mil­lions of lines of third-par­ty code it depend­ed upon, could I fil­ter out all the&nbsp;noise?</p>



<p>The answer, thank­ful­ly, was yes; since the debug­ger itself is writ­ten in Perl and designed to be extend­ed or replaced, I could add code at the begin­ning of our appli­ca­tion that inter­cept­ed each line as it was run, throw out any­thing that came from a file out­side of our application’s direc­to­ry fold­er, and then report the rest (along with help­ful line num­bers) to the error log. Then turn on the “debug” switch on the web serv­er run­ning the appli­ca­tion, and voilà, the log would duti­ful­ly fill up with (slow­er, more mem­o­ry-con­sum­ing) code report­ed by the debugger.</p>



<p>We set up our stag­ing serv­er to use the branch of code with debug­ging enabled, and then instruct­ed the appli­ca­tion to dis­play the prob­lem­at­ic cus­tomer’s records. As expect­ed, the error log imme­di­ate­ly began fill­ing up with line after line of our application’s code and then bang, crashed right after issu­ing a par­tic­u­lar data­base query for ser­vices tied to the account. I had my smok­ing gun! After extract­ing the query and run­ning it on a redact­ed copy of our data­base, I found that it was return­ing some 1.9 mil­lion rows of data as it retrieved pro­vi­sion­ing, billing, and renew­al his­to­ry for every ser­vice owned by the cus­tomer. This was far too many than nec­es­sary — the appli­ca­tion only cares about cur­rent sta­tus, and it was run­ning out of mem­o­ry as it cre­at­ed ser­vice objects for each&nbsp;row.</p>



<p>The data­base expert on my team was able to adjust the query to return only cur­rent infor­ma­tion, and after a quick test on the redact­ed data­base, the change is now wait­ing for qual­i­ty assur­ance test­ing before launch­ing to our pro­duc­tion servers. The debug­ging code branch will be saved until it’s need­ed again, and our team was once again grate­ful that we were work­ing in such a pow­er­ful pro­gram­ming lan­guage as&nbsp;Perl.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>Nine months ago, we embarked on a format migration for the persistent
(on-disk) representation of variable-length strings like symbolicated
call stacks in the <a href="https://www.backtrace.io/">Backtrace</a> server. We
chose a variant of
<a href="http://www.stuartcheshire.org/papers/COBSforToN.pdf">consistent overhead byte stuffing (COBS)</a>,
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-synchronizing_code">self-synchronising code</a>,
for the metadata (variable-length as well).
This choice let us improve our software’s resilience to data
corruption in local files, and then parallelise data hydration, which
improved startup times by a factor of 10… without any hard
migration from the old to the current on-disk data format.</p><p>In this post, I will explain why I believe that the representation of
first resort for binary logs (write-ahead, recovery, replay, or
anything else that may be consumed by a program) should be
self-synchronising, backed by this migration and by prior experience
with COBS-style encoding. I will also describe the
<a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/stuffed-record-stream">specific algorithm (available under the MIT license)</a>
we implemented for our server software.</p><p>This encoding offers low space overhead for framing, fast encoding and
faster decoding, resilience to data corruption, and a restricted form
of random access. Maybe it makes sense to use it for your own data!</p><h2 id="what-is-self-synchronisation-and-why-is-it-important">What is self-synchronisation, and why is it important?</h2><p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-synchronizing_code">code is self-synchronising</a>
when it’s always possible to unambiguously detect where a valid code
word (record) starts in a stream of symbols (bytes). That’s a
stronger property than prefix codes like Huffman codes, which only
detect when valid code words end. For example, the UTF-8
encoding is self-synchronising, because initial bytes and continuation
bytes differ in their high bits. That’s why it’s possible to decode
multi-byte code points when tailing a UTF-8 stream.</p><p>The UTF-8 code was designed for small integers (Unicode code points),
and can double the size of binary data. Other encodings are more
appropriate for arbitrary bytes; for example,
<a href="http://www.stuartcheshire.org/papers/COBSforToN.pdf">consistent overhead byte stuffing (COBS)</a>,
a self-synchronising code for byte streams, offers a worst-case
space overhead of one byte plus a 0.4% space blow-up.</p><p>Self-synchronisation is important for binary logs because it lets us
efficiently (with respect to both run time and space overhead) frame
records in a simple and robust manner… and we want simplicity and
robustness because logs are most useful when something has gone wrong.</p><p>Of course, the storage layer should detect and correct errors, but
things will sometimes fall through, especially for on-premises
software, where no one fully controls deployments. When that happens,
graceful partial failure is preferable to, e.g., losing all the
information in a file because one of its pages went to the great bit
bucket in the sky.</p><p>One easy solution is to spread the data out over multiple files or
blobs. However, there’s a trade-off between keeping data
fragmentation and file metadata overhead in check, and minimising the
blast radius of minor corruption. Our server must be able to run
on isolated nodes, so we can’t rely on design options available to
replicated systems… plus bugs tend to be correlated across replicas,
so there is something to be said for defense in depth, even with
distributed storage.</p><p>When each record is converted with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-synchronizing_code">self-synchronising code</a>
like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_Overhead_Byte_Stuffing">COBS</a>
before persisting to disk, we can decode all records that weren’t
directly impacted by corruption, exactly like decoding a stream of
mostly valid UTF-8 bytes. Any form of corruption will only make
us lose the records whose bytes were corrupted, and, at most, the two records
that immediately precede or follow the corrupt byte range. This
guarantee covers overwritten data (e.g., when a network switch flips a
bit, or a read syscall silently errors out with a zero-filled page),
as well as bytes removed or garbage inserted in the middle of log
files.</p><p>The coding doesn’t store redundant information: replication or erasure
coding is the storage layer’s responsibility. It instead guarantees
to <em>always</em> minimise the impact of corruption, and only lose records
that were adjacent to or directly hit by corruption.</p><p>A COBS encoding for log records achieves that by unambiguously
separating records with a reserved byte (e.g., 0), and re-encoding
each record to avoid that separator byte. A reader can thus assume
that potential records start and end at a log file’s first and last
bytes, and otherwise look for separator bytes to determine where to
cut all potential records. These records may be invalid: a
separator byte could be introduced or removed by corruption, and the
contents of a correctly framed record may be corrupt. When
that happens, readers can simply scan for the next separator byte and
try to validate that new potential record. The decoder’s state resets
after each separator byte, so any corruption is “forgotten” as soon as
the decoder finds valid a separator byte.</p><p>On the write side, the encoding logic is simple (a couple dozen lines
of C code), and uses a predictable amount of space, as expected from
an algorithm suitable for microcontrollers.</p><p>Actually writing encoded data is also easy:
on POSIX filesystems, we can make sure each record is delimited (e.g.,
prefixed with the delimiter byte), and issue a
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904875/functions/write.html">regular <code>O_APPEND</code> write(2)</a>.
Vectored writes can even insert delimiters without copying in
userspace. Realistically, our code is probably less stable than
operating system and the hardware it runs on, so we make sure our
writes make it to the kernel as soon as possible, and let <code>fsync</code>s
happen on a timer.</p><p>When a write errors out, we can blindly (maybe once or twice) try
again: the encoding is independent of the output file’s state. When a
write is cut short, we can still issue the same<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> write call,
without trying to “fix” the short write: the encoding and the
read-side logic already protect against that kind of corruption.</p><p>What if multiple threads or processes write to the same log file?
When we <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904875/functions/open.html">open with <code>O_APPEND</code></a>,
the operating system can handle the rest. This doesn’t make
contention disappear, but at least we’re not adding a bottleneck in
userspace on top of what is necessary to append to the same file.
Buffering is also trivial: the encoding is independent of the state of
the destination file, so we can always concatenate buffered records
and write the result with a single syscall.</p><p>This simplicity also plays well with
<a href="https://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf">high-throughput I/O primitives like <code>io_uring</code></a>, and with
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/append-block">blob stores that support appends</a>:
independent workers can concurrently queue up blind append requests and
retry on failure.
There’s no need for application-level mutual exclusion or rollback.</p><h2 id="fun-tricks-with-robust-readers">Fun tricks with robust readers</h2><p>Our log encoding will recover from bad bytes, as long as readers can
detect and reject invalid records as a whole; the processing logic
should also handle duplicated valid records. These are table stakes
for a reliable log consumer.</p><p>In our variable-length metadata use case, each record describes a
symbolicated call stack, and we recreate in-memory data structures by
replaying an append-only log of metadata records, one for each
unique call stack. The hydration phase handles invalid records by
ignoring (not recreating) any call stack with corrupt metadata,
but only those call stacks. That’s definitely an improvement over the
previous situation, where corruption in a size header would prevent us
from decoding the remainder of the file, and thus make us forget about
<em>all</em> call stacks stored at file offsets after the corruption.</p><p>Of course, losing data should be avoided, so we are careful to
<code>fsync</code> regularly and recommend reasonable storage configurations.
However, one can only make data loss unlikely, not impossible (if only
due to fat fingering), especially when cost is a factor. With the COBS
encoding, we can recover gracefully and automatically from any
unfortunate data corruption event.</p><p>We can also turn this robustness into new capabilities.</p><p>It’s often useful to process the tail of a log at a regular cadence.
For example, I once maintained a system that regularly tailed hourly
logs to update approximate views. One could support that use case with
length footers. COBS framing lets us instead scan
for a valid record from an arbitrary byte location, and read the rest
of the data normally.</p><p>When logs grow large enough, we want to process them in parallel. The
standard solution is to shard log streams, which unfortunately couples
the parallelisation and storage strategies, and adds complexity to the
write side.</p><p>COBS framing lets us parallelise readers independently of the writer.
The downside is that the read-side code and I/O patterns are now more
complex, but, all other things being equal, that’s a trade-off I’ll
gladly accept, especially given that our servers run on independent
machines and store their data in files, where reads are fine-grained
and latency relatively low.</p><p>A parallel COBS reader partitions a data file arbitrarily (e.g., in
fixed size chunks) for independent workers. A worker will scan for
the first valid record starting inside its assigned chunk, and handle
every record that <em>starts</em> in its chunk. Filtering on the start byte
means that a worker may read past the logical end of its chunk, when
it fully decodes the last record that starts in the chunk: that’s how
we unambiguously assign a worker to every record, including records
that straddle chunk boundaries.</p><p>Random access even lets us implement a form of binary or interpolation
search on raw unindexed logs, when we know the records are (k-)sorted
on the search key! This lets us, e.g., access the metadata for a few
call stacks without parsing the whole log.</p><p>Eventually, we might also want to truncate our logs.</p><p>Contemporary filesystems like XFS (and even Ext4) support large sparse
files. For example, sparse files can reach \(2^{63} - 1\) bytes on
XFS with a minimal metadata-only footprint: the on-disk data for such
sparse files is only allocated when we issue actual writes. Nowadays,
we can <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/415889/">sparsify files after the fact</a>,
and convert ranges of non-zero data into zero-filled “holes” in order
to release storage without messing with file …</p></div></article></div></div>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In December 2020, Apple announced the <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-max/">Airpods Max</a> and reviewers started waxing lyrical about how amazing these (extremely expensive) new ANC headphones from Apple truly were. As an Apple-eco-system stalwart, I considered that if I was going to spend <em>hundreds</em> of pounds on a pair of great ANC headphones, it might as well be <em>a couple more hundreds</em> of pounds for an <em>Apple</em> pair of headphones that would a) give the best performance and b) "just work" with all my Apple kit. As threats of a second school lock-down came to fruition I bit the bullet and ordered a pair.</p><h2 id="my-requirements">My requirements</h2><p>At this point its worth stating what I was <em>hoping</em> for from the Airpods Max, in priority order:</p><ol><li>Headphone noise cancellation that would cut out the noise of the house and it's occupants coming to my ears</li><li>Microphone voice isolation that would cut out the noise of the house and it's occupants reaching the ears of participants on video calls</li><li>Good-to-great sound quality of my voice on video calls</li><li>Great sound quality for listening to music while working</li></ol><h2 id="most-of-what-has-been-written-about-the-airpods-max-is-true">Most of what has been written about the Airpods Max is true</h2><p>The headphones arrived the second full week of January, a week before my wife and I had to start home-schooling the kids again but a time when both of us were back juggling full-time jobs with minding our 6, 8 and 10 year olds, plus the 10 month old puppy. </p><p>I'm not going to say much about the good bits of the Airpods Max because plenty has already been written on that. They do sound really great for music and for films. The most noticable thing to me was the way they project the sound in front of me when I'm listening to a normal stereo video on Youtube/Twitter/TikTok etc on the iPhone. It comes across as a very definite sound projection of about 30cms. I wouldn't say I like it especially more, but it's definitely a thing.</p><p>The ANC is exceptionally good at cutting out background noise. It fades it when you turn it on and I love the effect - it brings to mind a sound <em>animation</em>. I have subsequently tried a pair of Bose NC 700s and I can categorically say that the ANC on the Airpods Max is more effective at cutting out the normal background noise in my house.</p><p>However, as implied by the title, this isn't an article with a happy ending. In the end I had to send the Airpods Max back to Apple for a refund because they were four things that just did not work out for my use case. Without further ado, here they are...</p><h2 id="the-noise-cancellation-sucked">The noise cancellation sucked</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Let's tak about that ANC again. The use of 'sucked' in the title isn't (just) click-bait. The very first thing I noticed about the Airpods Max was that the ANC didn't feel great in my ears. I'd describe it as like the feeling you have when you need to repressurise your ears on an airplane. It doesn't bother you particularly at the time but when you swallow you realise it feels better. Taking off the Airpods Max felt like returning my inner ears to their natural, unadorned state. When I posted this on Twitter, @madmax helpfully pointed me to <a href="https://www.soundstagesolo.com/index.php/features/178-eardrum-suck-the-mystery-solved">an article</a> about <em>Eardrum Suck</em><sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> which I'm inclined to believe is the issue here. The ANC effect is very good at filtering out background noise, but it definitely <em>feels</em> like an effect.</p>

In my environment that is raised voices, dog barks, footsteps on the wooden floor, metallic noises from the kitchen and the previously described <em>ka-thunk</em> of closing doors. The ANC on the Airpods Max does not do well with any of these. To be fair it is a tough challenge. But what I was not expecting, what blew me away<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> was that low frequency event noise (e.g. a <em>ka-thunk</em> of a door) could actually create an uncomfortable ANC burp right into my ear drum. Like a Q-tip that's gone too deep. It's not pleasant and it happens every 10 minutes in my house. Imagine that - a Q-tip to the ear drum every 10 minutes! It doesn't take much of that to make a man want to take his headphones off his irreplaceable ear drums, no matter how expensive they were!</p>

How much worse? Well I'm glad you asked. My desktop Mac<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> uses a Bluetooth 4.0 chipset. When the Airpods Max connect to a Bluetooth 4.0 chipset you end up with 8kHz audio. You can search the internet for this - it also happens for the regular Airpods and Airpods Pro. If you've been on a Zoom call with someone using Airpods that sounded like they are on the world's worst telephone - this is probably the reason. It can support 48kHz streaming audio simplex but only 8kHz duplex. I'm not a Bluetooth engineer but something doesn't add up here.</p>

But we are still getting a sub-par audio experience if the microphones are in use. The standard response from pretty much <em>everyone</em> on the internet is to turn off the device as an input source and use the internal microphone on your machine.

But suffice to say that if you are getting 24kHz duplex then you can probably stop worrying about wireless quality problems. I wish I had a modern Mac with Bluetooth 5 built in to verify that the same is acheiveable on a modern chipset Mac.

<p>#Davos2021 starts today.</p>
<p>We’ve all been hearing a lot The Great Reset lately, new slogans abound such as Build Back Better, the New Normal, and what seems to be a “new” model called “Stakeholder Capitalism” is being espoused (although it is not new, I wrote about the pendulum swinging from stakeholder supremacy to shareholder supremacy back in the days of Milton Friedman in the <a href="https://bombthrower.com/articles/the-transition-overview-building-companies-that-matter/">inaugural post</a> for this site).</p>
<p>Recently I decided it would be helpful challenge my own reflexive inclination to suspect that we were all being collectively screwed by our institutions, yet again.&nbsp; I wondered if these momentous shifts were simply one of those tectonic phase shifts that occur throughout history and that I shouldn’t leap to the conclusion that it’s some disingenuous and ultimately malevolent&nbsp; pseudo-reality being imposed from above.</p>

<p>It is fitting that on this&nbsp; first day of #Davos2021 I outline my arc in which I tried to suspend disbelief around The Great Reset narrative, forcing myself to pose the question:</p>
<h3>What if The Great Reset was getting a bad rap?</h3>
<p>Maybe it’s true that the world has changed irrevocably, <em>and</em> that change hasn’t been driven or captured by a razor thin scab of elites at the top of the socio-economic pyramid who are setting the agenda. The idea of a reset may be well founded, after all when I first started writing about wealth inequality and crony capitalism over a decade ago, I called it <a href="https://rebootingcapitalism.com/">“Rebooting Capitalism”.</a></p>
<p>So I started going through Klaus Schwab’s books: <strong>The Fourth Industrial Revolution</strong> (2016), <strong>COVID-19: The Great Reset </strong>(2020) and most recently, <strong>Stakeholder Capitalism. </strong>(2021)<strong>. </strong>&nbsp;It started out as s a curious blend of nodding one’s head in agreement, underlining numerous passages, musing that maybe this is just descriptive, not prescriptive. By that I mean, maybe Schwab is simply trying to make sense of the shifts occurring, and not really offering frameworks around what&nbsp;<em>should</em> happen next, but just trying to parse what is happening and possible trajectories of the future.</p>
<p>This former case is similar to Warren Mosler’s description of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). It describes how Mosler and other MMT-ers think the system actually works and why the outcomes will not be as conventional economics generally fears. In Stephenie Kelton’s more recent book <strong>The Deficit Myth</strong>, she builds on this theme that MMT is more descriptive with some prescriptive policy <em>recommendations. </em>But my overall sense of it is that these books about MMT were more about trying to articulate a new way of looking at the existing system and not trying to drive a completely overriding agenda (even if that’s what would happen if policy makers <a href="https://bombthrower.com/articles/the-disturbing-rise-of-modern-monetary-theory-mmt/">seize on MMT as a rationalization</a> for destroying their currencies).</p>
<p>I mention MMT here specifically because we touch on it again when I contrast it to Charles Hugh Smith’s concept of Community Labour Integrated Money Economy (CLIME), a little later.</p>
<p>With Schwab, he spends a lot of time in a descriptive mode, talking about the what is happening in the world, although we do see some of his assumptions creeping in and for awhile, I am cautiously optimistic that if everything Schwab outlines as a&nbsp;<em>policy&nbsp;</em>response to global issues like global poverty, and of course now, the pandemic, maybe it’s just the way of the world and this is the direction things are going without there necessarily being a SPECTRE-like entity in the WEF driving a self-serving agenda.</p>
<p>When Schwab talks about how a grand ideal of a standard issue One World Government model, what he calls the Neoliberal Utopia simply will not work, I breathe a sigh of relief,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Consider&nbsp; a global government [that] regulates multinational companies in global markets, and people gather in a global democracy and global unions. It is an unrealistic an undesirable goal, as it increases the distance between individuals and the immediate social ecosystems they are a part of. It also decreases their feeling of commitment to the people and the environment closest to them…Though the 20th century neoliberalists once may have seen such a global model as a Utopian ideal, it would inevitably end in the political disenfranchisement of local communities. When the center of power is too far removed&nbsp; from people’s everyday realities, neither political governance nor economic decision-making would have popular support.”<br>
— Stakeholder Capitalism p.181</p></blockquote>

<p>But then, the more I read, the more I couldn’t shake the sense that when a guy like Schwab means by the word “commitment, what he really means is “obedience”. Schwab understands that people aren’t really going to accept decisions from on high, especially if on high is a centralized world government.</p>
<h2>What we really need is “Subsidiarity”</h2>
<p>Schwab goes on to introduce with a flourish one of the core pillars of Stakeholder Capitalism: <strong>Subsidiarity&nbsp;</strong>(the other is “Value creation and sharing”):</p>
<blockquote><p>A primary principle for the implementation of Stakeholder Capitalism is therefore that of&nbsp;<strong><em>subsidiarity.&nbsp;</em></strong>It is not an untested or purely theoretical principal. Applied most famously in the governance of the European Union..it asserts that decisions should be taken at the most granular level possible, closest to where they will have the most noticeable effects. It determines, in other words, that local stakeholders should be able to decide for themselves, <strong>except when it is not feasible or effective for them to do so.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Subsidiarity is&nbsp;<em>supposed</em> to mean “whatever can be done at lower levels of government should not be done at higher levels”, but my guess is the devil would be in the details. Like in that last sentence of the quote, when it is not feasible or effective for the “stakeholders” in Stakeholder Capitalism to decide certain matters for themselves, those will have to be decided for them.</p>
<p>What would those sorts of issues be?</p>
<p>Well for starters, there’s climate change. That’s one of the things that’s already been decided…</p>
<blockquote><p>“It makes sense to coordinate this challenge first at the global level.” but then the second level is at the national level, where countries can take different approaches, <em>a limit on auto travel would have significant effect in the United States</em>, where cars are the primary mode of transportation. Taking a different approach, such as <em>limiting air travel</em>, would affect certain groups of people more than others. Subsidiarity supports a national or local level of decision making for countries to determine which path will work best for them to effectively address the global goal”.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Schwab blithely bandies about various limitations and curtailments on everybody else’s range of motion and economic choices, there is never any treatment of climate change as anything&nbsp;<em>but </em> a global crisis that justifies the complete re-ordering of everybody’s lives.</p>
<p>And yet, the same level of drastic re-ordering of everybody else’s lives is proffered in Schwab’s other book, COVID-19: The Great Reset, even though by his own admission in that same book, COVID-19 is a not civilization ending plague:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Even in the worst-case horrendous scenario, COVID-19 will kill far fewer people than the Great Plagues, including the Black Deaths, or World War II did”<br>
— COVID-19: The Great Reset p. 17</p></blockquote>
<p>Albeit one that provides an excellent opportunity to reorder everybody else’s lives,</p>
<blockquote><p>changes that would have seemed inconceivable before the pandemic struck, such as new forms of monetary policy like helicopter money (already a given), the reconsideration/recalibration of some of our social priorities and augmented search for the common good as a policy objective, the notion of fairness acquiring political potency,&nbsp;<strong>radical welfare and taxation measures</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>drastic geopolitical realignments</strong>.</p>
<p>The broader point is this: the possibilities for change and the resulting new order are now unlimited and only bound by our imagination, for better or for worse. Societies could be poised to become either more egalitarian or more authoritarian, or geared towards more solidarity or more individualism, favouring the interests of the few or the many…</p></blockquote>
<p>You get the point: <strong><em>we (as in the WEF)</em>&nbsp;should take advantage of this unprecedented opportunity to reimagine <em>your</em> world</strong>.</p>
<p>If COVID-19 is a comparatively lightweight pandemic to be opportunistically seized upon to drastically reorder everybody’s lives, one cant help but wonder if the climate “crisis” isn’t yet another global softball. Perhaps in the cold light of day, it could turn out that climate change is either out of our hands (if it is driven largely or even partially <a href="https://www.livescience.com/61716-sun-cooling-global-warming.html">by solar cycles</a>) or that climate alarmism is in itself more toxic and destructive than the direct effects of climate change itself, as Michael Shellenberger asserts in <strong>“Apocalypse Never”</strong>,</p>
<blockquote><p>Apocalypse Never explores how and why so many of us came to see important but manageable environmental problems as the end of the world, and why the people who are the most apocalyptic about environmental problems tend to oppose the best and most obvious solutions to solving them.</p>
<p>Shellenberger, Michael. Apocalypse Never (p. xi). Harper. Kindle Edition.</p></blockquote>
<p>Shouldn’t there be some sort of process or governance structure in there to protect the world’s citizens from being overly regulated by somebody else’s idea of what is important? Should there be some counterbalance to these unilateral assessments of when drastic measures are required, especially when those measures would supersede our own agency in directing&nbsp; our own lives?</p>
<p>But there isn’t, not in Schwab’s Stakeholder Capitalism after the The Great Reset.</p>
<p>What we get instead is “subsidiarity”:</p>
<p>Another example around climate change, conspicuous in its lack of coverage in Schwab’s books is the idea of nuclear energy.</p>
<p>If the entire world is headed toward an eventual transition off of fossil fuels (if for no other reason than Peak Oil) then shouldn’t the safest, cleanest, efficient energy source be featured prominently? The <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/x-energy-developing-pebble-bed-reactor-they-say-cant-melt-down">next generation pebble bed reactors</a> and …</p></section></div>

<p>We often get customers&nbsp;ringing for quotes and being surprised (and sometimes shocked) at the prices we charge. We will get comments along the lines of <em>“So-and-so can do that airport trip for £35. <a href="https://www.harttaxis.com/what-does-it-cost-to-go-to-the-airport/">You’re charging £50</a>”</em>.</p>



<p>That is perfectly true. There will <em>always</em> be someone who can do the job at a lower price than Hart Taxis can. We do not compete on price.</p>


<div id="attachment_1405"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1405" loading="lazy" src="https://www.harttaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-Taxi-2-300x300.png" alt="Best Taxi service in Fleet, Yateley, Hartley Wintney" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://www.harttaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-Taxi-2-300x300.png 300w, https://www.harttaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-Taxi-2-150x150.png 150w, https://www.harttaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-Taxi-2-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://www.harttaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-Taxi-2-250x250.png 250w, https://www.harttaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-Taxi-2.png 1056w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-1405">Hart Taxis won the ‘Best Taxi Service in Fleet’ award for two years running.</p></div>
<p>The fact of the matter is that there is a set minimum cost to doing business in the taxi trade. This cost includes such items as hourly rates for drivers, servicing costs for vehicles, insurance, licence fees etc.</p>
<p>Some of these fees are non-negotiable: You have to have insurance and you have to have a hackney carriage licence.&nbsp;Other costs are more malleable. For example rather than trying to let a driver earn a living wage by working a maximum 12 hour shift you can cut the amount you pay a driver and force him to work 14 to 18 hours per day for 7 days per week to earn enough. There is an obvious impact on driver safety when this happens.</p>
<p>The other way is to cut down on the servicing for your vehicles. At a recent snap examination in the small hours of the morning the police and the VOSN stopped a number of taxis in Fleet and found that several of them were running vehicles with questionable service records. One of our competitor’s vehicles&nbsp;was found to have four bald tyres and was immediately impounded by the police as being unsafe to drive on the road. All Hart Taxis vehicles passed with flying colours.</p>
<p>The next time you book a vehicle which is ‘cheap’ bear in mind that the driver <em>may</em> have been working 14 or 15 hours when he gets to you and <em>may</em> be running a vehicle which is barely road legal. Both of these factors put you, the passenger, at risk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I work in the haulage&nbsp;business and understand the issues facing drivers working long hours. I’m happy to pay the rates Hart Taxis charge if it means my taxi will be on time, with a driver who is awake and ready to drive in a road-safe vehicle – A Hart Taxis customer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore there are some taxis who will cut costs by not providing a good service. This may be by promising to arrive at a certain time but then regularly turning up late. Sometimes late enough for you to miss your flight or your train at the station. They may arrive looking scruffy, unshaven or badly dressed. They may take you on a longer route than you expected and <a href="https://www.harttaxis.com/2018/04/know-the-full-fare-before-you-get-in-the-vehicle/">hike the fares up that way</a>. Or there may be additional hidden fees added to your fare when you arrive. A good example of this is those companies that <a href="https://www.harttaxis.com/what-does-it-cost-to-go-to-the-airport/">charge a low fare for an airport pick-up</a> but then hit you with parking fees and waiting time – especially if your plane arrives late.</p>
<p>Let me be clear; I am not saying that <em>all</em> our cheaper competitors are running their drivers ragged with dirty, unsafe vehicles, lying to customers about when they are going to arrive and causing them to miss their planes and trains. But I am saying that every single one of those behaviours has been reported for one or more of the taxi companies working in the Hart district. All of the companies who have had these behaviours reported about them charge less than Hart Taxis for their services.</p>
<p>With Hart Taxis you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smart drivers who have been working a maximum of 12 hours in a single shift and a maximum of 6 shifts per week.</li>
<li>Smart, washed and valeted cars</li>
<li>Road legal vehicles with full service history.</li>
<li>Vehicle tracking services so you can see where your driver is from when they accept your job to when they arrive.</li>
<li>Text information detailing the make, colour and registration of the vehicle that will be picking you up.</li>
<li>Meet and greet service at the airport where we monitor your incoming flight and only send the driver at the appropriate time.</li>
<li>Bottled water on arrival at our airport jobs.</li>
<li>Automated booking via our <a href="https://harttaxis.com/meet-oliviar">Oliviar</a> booking system with the industry’s leading <a href="http://cordic.com/">booking and despatch software</a></li>
<li>Full E-receipt provided on completion of job, if required.</li>
</ul>
<p>This service is something which Hart Taxis are proud&nbsp;to offer. But in order to offer this we expect our drivers to be paid an appropriate amount of money.</p>
<p>That is why Hart Taxis are considered by our customers to provide excellent value for money despite being more expensive than others. If you are price sensitive then please let us know and we will happily give you the contact details for our competitors. They may well be cheaper – but at what cost?</p>
<p>Please feel free to check out our <a href="https://www.harttaxis.com/testimonials-2/">testimonials page</a> if you want more feedback about our service. We think you’ll feel that the higher price is worth it.</p></div></div>]]>

We seem to be able to wrap our heads around how to <a href="https://visiblechild.com/2015/07/20/limit-setting-grabbing/">respectfully set limits</a>, <a href="https://visiblechild.com/2015/07/04/choices-part-1-of-3-why-when/">offer choices</a>, acknowledge their feelings, understand the <a href="https://visiblechild.com/2015/06/22/consequences-how-we-misuse-them/">differences between natural and logical consequences</a>, even calmly support them through tantrums. But when push comes to shove, there is one thing that stumps us:</p>
<p>“What do I do when they simply refuse to do what I am asking them to do?”</p>
<p>I would reword the question, actually.&nbsp; Don’t get me wrong, I hear you.&nbsp; You’re asking what to do when your kids refuse to pick up their toys, put their clothes on, brush their teeth, clean up a mess they made.&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; i would still reword it.&nbsp; I hear the words that you are asking.&nbsp; And after they go through the filter that is oh-so-handily inside my ears, the question looks a lot more like:</p>
<p>“What do I do wh<img data-attachment-id="2056" data-permalink="https://visiblechild.com/2015/09/02/model-graciousness/tickertape/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/tickertape.jpg?fit=880%2C865&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="880,865" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="tickertape" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/tickertape.jpg?fit=300%2C295&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/tickertape.jpg?fit=640%2C629&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/tickertape.jpg?resize=150%2C147&amp;ssl=1" alt="tickertape" width="150" height="147" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/tickertape.jpg?resize=150%2C147&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7">en I’m not in control?”</p>
<p>That’s right.&nbsp; Control.&nbsp;&nbsp; We’re all a little obsessed with control, in my opinion.&nbsp; It’s one of those things that falls solidly in the “should” or “have to” category.&nbsp; It’s the lever on the ticker tape machine (oops, I think I’m dating myself–pic over there, just in case) that rolls out endless tape that reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>“If I don’t make them do it, I’m a pushover,”</p>
<p>“She HAS to.&nbsp; I’m the parent, I have to make her do it,”</p>
<p>“It’s my JOB to teach her.&nbsp; She may be stubborn, but I can outlast her.”</p>
<p>“My life is going to be hell if I don’t insist that they do it.&nbsp; They’ll walk all over me.”</p>
<p>“I am NOT going to have one of those entitled kids who expect their parents to do everything for them.”</p>
<p>“They have to learn responsibility and that actions have consequences!”</p>
<p>“I have to make it clear that I’m in charge. It’s non-negotiable.&nbsp; I’ll sit here until they do it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>What did you think and feel as you read those examples? My guess is that most of you felt some version of “That’s RIGHT!” And you would find a lot of support for that.&nbsp; Yes, even among “gentle” or “respectful” parents and bloggers.&nbsp; Ironically, I’ve found more rigidity among these communities than I might have expected.&nbsp; To me, it looks like a reaction to being seen as “permissive.”&nbsp; We want people to be sure to know that just because we’re respectful or gentle, we <strong><em>aren’t</em></strong> permissive, so we talk a lot about how to get kids to do things, because if we’re tough (and yet still kind), it proves that we’re not the doormats that people make us out to be.</p>
<p>I don’t buy it.</p>
<p>So once again, I find myself in a position of seeing things a bit differently (yeah, it’s my destiny.)&nbsp; You know what I think and feel as I read those examples up there?&nbsp; I think that they all sound a bit like we’re dealing with the enemy.&nbsp; They’re adversarial.&nbsp; I’m right, they’re wrong.&nbsp; I know better.&nbsp; They’re just stubborn.&nbsp; I have to break them.&nbsp; I’m The Parent.</p>
<p>Yup.&nbsp; Control.</p>
<p>And fear.&nbsp; Let’s not forget about fear.&nbsp; Fear that we’ll be ineffectual.&nbsp; Fear that our children will grow up to be entitled.&nbsp; Fear that our friends and relatives who think we’re those kooky people who do that “gentle discipline stuff” will laugh and shake their heads at us, either in our presence or behind our backs, or both.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or worse yet, they’ll “tsk” at us, as if to say “Well, if you were more in charge, your kids would have better manners.”&nbsp; Lots of fear in parenting.&nbsp; Yup.</p>
<p>See, the thing is, I don’t think we don’t have to have that sort of relationship with our children. I know we think we do.&nbsp; But we don’t.&nbsp; It’s a choice.&nbsp; It’s not a non-negotiable.&nbsp; There <em>are</em> other ways.&nbsp; So let’s talk about just one of them.&nbsp; And no, it does NOT lead to children who walk all over you.</p>
<p>Now, before you think I’ve gone completely loony tunes (or–gasp–that I <em>am</em> in favor of permissiveness, which I assure you that I am not), let me say that yes, I do know and accept that our role as parents is to “teach” responsibility, values, helpfulness, manners, self-care, independence, routines, cause and effect, blah blah blah.&nbsp; The problem–and it<em> is</em> a problem–is that these are things that can’t be taught.&nbsp; Well, okay, they can be taught.&nbsp; It’s true, you can make your kid do anything. But the things that you “teach” don’t stick.&nbsp; Not in the way that I want them to at least.</p>
<p>Children do not learn from what we say.&nbsp; They don’t even learn from what we do.&nbsp; <strong>They learn from who we are.&nbsp; And they’re always watching.</strong></p>
<p>That’s why I choose to model graciousness.</p>
<p>Now before we go any further, let me just say that, although I have used this strategy for as long as I can remember–first with the children I worked with and then with my own child–I did not come up with this nifty difty little name.&nbsp; I owe that to a wonderful woman from New Zealand, an unschooling mom that I met online in several RIE discussion groups.&nbsp; Whenever this topic would come up, she would be a lone voice.&nbsp; Amid the fifty or sixty comments in which parents gave one another tip after tip about how to get-the-kid-to-do-the-thing, suddenly her name would appear, and next to it, it would say two words:&nbsp; Model Graciousness.&nbsp; There it was.&nbsp; In two words.&nbsp; Perfect.&nbsp; (<em>Thank you, L.</em>)</p>
<p>So this is my answer (now that I have a name for it and all.)&nbsp; Model graciousness.</p>
<p>What does it mean?</p>
<p>It means that you demonstrate and model for them the authentic spirit and intention that you wish for them to possess.&nbsp; If you want them to be generous, be generous (yes, of spirit, not just with “things.”)&nbsp; If you want them to be helpful, be helpful.&nbsp; If you want them to help without being asked, help without being asked.&nbsp; If you want them to speak softly, speak softly.&nbsp; If you want them to say thank you, say thank you.&nbsp; Always without resentment—because I presume that you don’t want children who resent you.&nbsp; You get the idea.</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; It’s really that simple.</p>
<p>She intentionally (or so it appears) pours a glass of milk on to the table, where it cascades on to the floor.&nbsp; Having he<a href="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/spilled-milk.jpeg?ssl=1"><img data-attachment-id="2051" data-permalink="https://visiblechild.com/2015/09/02/model-graciousness/spilled-milk/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/spilled-milk.jpeg?fit=500%2C623&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="500,623" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="spilled-milk" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/spilled-milk.jpeg?fit=241%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/spilled-milk.jpeg?fit=500%2C623&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/spilled-milk.jpeg?resize=241%2C300&amp;ssl=1" alt="spilled-milk" width="241" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/visiblechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/spilled-milk.jpeg?resize=241%2C300&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a>r help clean it up is a logical consequence.&nbsp; You get her a rag, and you ask (or preferably, tell) her to clean up the milk she spilled.&nbsp; She refuses.&nbsp; Or laughs.&nbsp; Or runs off.&nbsp; You go get her and you calmly explain that the milk is on the floor and it has to get cleaned up because if it stays there it will start to smell really bad and it will make the floor slippery and dangerous, and that you’d like her to help clean it up, and that you will help her.&nbsp; You get two cloths, and offer her one, and you ask (tell) her “I need your help to clean up the milk.&nbsp; Here is your cloth and here is my cloth.&nbsp; We’ll do it together.”&nbsp; Or you get one cloth and a small container of water, and you say “We need to clean up the milk.&nbsp; Would you like to use the cloth to wipe it up or would you like to hold the container while I wipe it up?”&nbsp; <em><strong>(Pay attention: here’s where it gets tricky.&nbsp; don’t stop reading now!)&nbsp; </strong></em>She refuses again.&nbsp; Or laughs again.&nbsp; Or throws the rag.&nbsp; Or runs off again.&nbsp; You’re sitting there (undoubtedly frustrated) thinking <em>“But I asked just the right way!&nbsp; I gave her choices!&nbsp; I offered to help her!&nbsp; She can’t just pour milk on the floor and not have any consequence!&nbsp; I have to wait her out or make her come do it–how do I do that?&nbsp; I’m perfectly calm, I’m not getting upset, I’m doing everything the way the books/experts say to do, and she’s still not helping!&nbsp; I have the most out of control kid ever.&nbsp; What now?!?)</em></p>
<p>I’ll tell you “what now.”&nbsp; Model graciousness.&nbsp; Clean it up.&nbsp; Say, with confidence (and feel with confidence, too…that matters) that you’re happy to help this time and that you’re sure she will help next time.&nbsp; Because you <em>are</em> sure that she’ll help next time (right??)&nbsp; And if it turns out that you’re wrong, and she <em>doesn’t</em> help next time, still have confidence that she will do it the next time (and chalk it up to developmental stage or fatigue or teething or a long day at school or that toy that broke earlier in the day.)&nbsp; Quiet the anxious voices in your head that say “<em>if i clean it up,</em> <em>she’ll never learn responsibility</em>.”&nbsp; Quiet the resentful voices in your head that say <em>“I’m sick of doing everything for her when she’s perfectly capable of doing it herself.</em>” Quiet the punitive voices in your head that say “<em>she spilled it, she needs to clean it up.”</em> &nbsp; Have trust that she will do it next time.&nbsp; Because one of these times, she will.&nbsp; <strong>She will be like you.&nbsp; Helpful.&nbsp; Generous.&nbsp; Altruistic.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I would give another example, but it works pretty much the same way no matter what the example is.&nbsp; You know that expression “Be the change you wish to see in the world?”&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; This is that, parenting style.</p>
<p>You want to know why.&nbsp; I know you want to know why.&nbsp; So I’m going to put it as simply as I possibly can:&nbsp; <strong>“I didn’t do it.”</strong></p>
<p>I know that all of us have heard this,&nbsp; whether as a child ourselves, as a teacher, as a parent, among extended family, or at the park.&nbsp; A parent or a teacher or an older child asks (tells?) children to clean something up.&nbsp; They say “I didn’t do it”&nbsp; or “It’s not my mess” or “<em>You</em> clean it up” or “I wasn’t working over there.”</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but for me, this phrase is like fingernails on a chalkboard.&nbsp; It is the epitome of everything that I do not want my child to be.&nbsp; I want to raise a child who is prosocial, generous, altruistic, empathic.&nbsp; I want my child to be the one the teacher sends an email about because she was the only one who didn’t laugh when another child’s experiment blew up in science class, and the only one who went over and helped him clean it up without being asked.&nbsp; I never want to hear the words “it’s not my mess” come out of my child’s mouth when she is asked to help clean up–by me or anyone else. I want her to smile and say “Sure.”&nbsp; And I don’t only want her to help–I want her to help without resentment of any sort. (is it a pipe dream?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; It isn’t.)&nbsp; This is what altruism <em>is.</em>&nbsp; I hold it sacred.</p>
<p>If I want <em>her</em> to do that and be that person, then<em> I</em> have to do that and be that person.&nbsp; Help without resentment.&nbsp; Accept others’ emotional or developmental limitations, either in general or in the moment.&nbsp; …</p></div></div>

<p>The <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.openstreetmap.org">Open Street Map database</a> contains detailed information about almost every square metre of the surface of the planet. Land use, building types, rivers, park benches, pubs, streets and millions of other data points are all mapped out and documented in detail.</p>



<div><p>You might be familiar with the browser-based <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">Open Street Map (OSM) website</a>. Superficially it resembles mapping services like Google or Bing, but you may not be aware that the huge mapping dataset that powers it can also be accessed directly. Need to find all the power lines in a city? Count the number of pubs per square kilometre? Visualise COVID cases region by region? Or maybe you just want to solve a <a href="https://quiztime.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://quiztime.com">Quiztime</a> puzzle? OSM’s vast database can be queried to support almost any mapping use case you can think of.</p><p>The OSM database can be queried via an API called <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API" data-type="URL" data-id="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API">Overpass</a>. It’s very powerful but it isn’t very beginner friendly and constructing queries requires a little coding knowledge. </p></div>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1030" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.21.47-2048x1030.png" alt="" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.21.47-2048x1030.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.21.47-300x151.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.21.47-768x386.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.21.47-1536x773.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"></figure></div>



<p>A more accessible way to access Overpass exists in the form of <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/">Overpass Turbo</a>. Overpass Turbo allows you to build Overpass queries in a much more user friendly way. You can build the query, run it, and then see the data represented on the map. The results can also be returned in a CSV or JSON format, which makes incorporating them into your own mapping projects much easier.</p>



<h3>Basic Concepts</h3>



<p>Although Overpass Turbo is more user friendly than querying Overpass directly, it is nothing like as easy to use as Google Maps for example. It is much more powerful than Google Maps, but constructing effective queries requires an understanding of the data types that OSM contains. </p>



<div><p>The syntax is also much stricter. If you enter “five star hotel near Disneyland” as your Overpass Turbo query, you won’t get very far.</p><p>It’s worth spending a short time getting familiar with the basic types of OSM data before starting to build queries. </p></div>



<h3>Geometries</h3>



<p>There are three main types of object in the OSM database. These are known as geometries. Every object represented on an OSM map is one of these types.</p>



<h3>Node</h3>



<p>A node is a single point on a map. It has a unique ID number and a set of coordinates. <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4340279542#map=17/52.28932/8.03031" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4340279542#map=17/52.28932/8.03031">This park bench</a> next to a canal in the city of Osnabrück is a single node:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1858" height="1440" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.52.42.png" alt="" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.52.42.png 1858w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.52.42-300x233.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.52.42-768x595.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-20.52.42-1536x1190.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1858px) 100vw, 1858px"></figure></div>



<p>You can see it has a unique ID number, lat/long coordinates, and some tags that describe its properties. We’ll discuss tags shortly.</p>



<h3>Way</h3>



<p>Next to the bench is a railway line. Linear features cannot be represented by a single node on a map, so paths, roads, rivers and motorways are represented by multiple nodes linked together to form a way. A way is just a collection of linked nodes.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="884" height="882" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.16.52.png" alt="" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.16.52.png 884w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.16.52-300x300.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.16.52-150x150.png 150w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.16.52-768x766.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 884px) 100vw, 884px"></figure></div>



<p>Ways do not just have to be linear like railways or canals. A collection of nodes can start and end on the same point to form a shape. <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/94423432">This airfield</a> just outside Osnabrück is not a node, but a way. Its boundary is defined by a series of single nodes linked together to form a polygon:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1058" height="674" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.19.04.png" alt="" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.19.04.png 1058w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.19.04-300x191.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.19.04-768x489.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1058px) 100vw, 1058px"></figure></div>



<p>So to find objects that are greater than a single point on a map, it is necessary to search for ways and not just nodes. We will see shortly that there is a way to combine these kinds of query, but we need to look at the final data type first.</p>



<h3>Relation</h3>



<p>A node is a single point. A way is a series of linked nodes. A relation combines ways and nodes to form more complex objects. </p>



<p>Let’s say that you want to represent a train route in OSM. You have nodes (stations, signals) and ways (track sections, bridges, perhaps larger stations). To represent the route would require combining these nodes and ways into a single “route” object. These kind of combinations are known as “relations”.</p>



<p>Let’s go back to Osnabrück. The Hafen area is an administrative district in the north of the city. In OSM it is a collection of ways that mark the geographic boundary and also a single node denoting it is an administrative centre. It is too complex an object to be either just a way or just a node, so the nodes and ways are combined to form a relation.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1168" height="1178" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.17.40.png" alt="" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.17.40.png 1168w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.17.40-297x300.png 297w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.17.40-150x150.png 150w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.17.40-768x775.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1168px) 100vw, 1168px"></figure></div>



<p>Multiple ways form the boundary. The single node in the middle refers to the administrative centre. This can be seen in the info panel in OSM (right click on the map and click “query features”):</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="658" height="438" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.38.53.png" alt="" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.38.53.png 658w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.38.53-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px"></figure></div>



<p>The Hafen area is a <em>relation</em> made up of 5 <em>ways</em> and a single <em>node</em>.</p>



<h3>Tags</h3>



<p>Tags are the key to finding information in OSM. As we’ve just seen, every object in OSM is either a node, way, or a relation. These objects contain location data but they do not contain descriptive information. Nodes, ways and objects are labelled and described with a series of Tags. </p>



<p>The first object we looked at was a <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4340279543">park bench</a>. It’s a node with a unique reference number of 4340279543 and lat/long coordinates of <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=18/52.2910290/8.0265765">52.2910290, 8.0265765</a>. That is all the information a node needs to exist – but how could anyone ever find it or even know what it was based on those details alone? </p>



<p>OSM objects need additional information in order for them to be described and indexed properly. Tags are used to do this. The bench has several tags to describe it:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="658" height="438" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.48.49.png" alt="" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.48.49.png 658w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-21.48.49-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px"></figure></div>



<p>This is a very powerful system, but there is one difficulty with tags. In Overpass Turbo I cannot just do a freetext search like “park bench” and be certain that I will find a matching tag. The tags I use to search have to match exactly with the tags as they were assigned by OSM contributors, so if I just guess the tag name I will probably be wrong and I won’t find what I’m looking for. Overpass Turbo’s Query Wizard can help slightly by suggesting tags based on search terms, but it pays to know how tags are constructed in order to be as accurate as possible with your results.</p>



<h3>TagInfo</h3>



<p>OSM’s <a href="https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/">Taginfo site </a>allows you to search for tags that have already been added to the database. Using the search box in the top right we can search for the keys and values that make up tags so they can be added to our queries.</p>



<p>Let’s say that I want to find wind turbines. I enter the term “wind turbine” into the Taginfo search box and get <a href="https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/search?q=wind+turbine#keys">these results</a>. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-22.04.57.png" alt="" width="722" height="391" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-22.04.57.png 1812w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-22.04.57-300x163.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-22.04.57-768x417.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-23-at-22.04.57-1536x834.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px"></figure></div>



<p>OSM Tags are always made up of a key-value pair. You can think of keys as a main type, and values as a subtype. Examples of common key-value pairs might be <code data-enlighter-language="raw">building=school,</code> or <code data-enlighter-language="raw">highway=motorway.</code> </p>



<p>This means that just creating a tag called “wind turbine” won’t work in OSM. The tag must have both a key <em>and</em> a value.</p>



<p>The image above shows how people have created key-value pairs to describe wind turbines. By far the most popular is the tag <code data-enlighter-language="md">generator:method = wind_turbine</code>. </p>



<p>You can see the tag is comprised of the key <code data-enlighter-language="generic">generator:method</code> and the value <code data-enlighter-language="generic">wind_turbine.</code> You can also see that there are 240,052 objects in the OSM database that are tagged this way, so to find a wind turbine this will be the best tag to use. By contrast if I searched with the tag <code data-enlighter-language="generic">name = Wind turbine</code> this would only match 18 objects in the entire database, so I’m unlikely to find what I’m looking for.</p>



<p>Here are all the results for the <code>generator:method = wind_turbine</code> query in Osnabrück:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="421" height="475" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-25-at-14.08.12.png" alt="" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-25-at-14.08.12.png 421w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-25-at-14.08.12-266x300.png 266w" sizes="(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px"></figure></div>



<h3>Bounding Boxes</h3>



<p>Before putting these concepts into action it’s important to mention the concept of bounding boxes. When querying Overpass it is necesary to set a North, South, East and West boundary point of the box you wish to search in. These are normally defined with coordinates sent to the API, but fortunately Overpass Turbo creates this box for you based on the map area in view in the right hand window. The coordinates are represented by the <code data-enlighter-language="generic">{{bbox}}</code> tag in the query code. Overpass Turbo will only search for data matches within the box area you specify.</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>In this post we’ve looked at the basic building blocks of OSM and Overpass Turbo. In the next post we’ll put them together to build some queries and start retrieving data.</p>

<article>
  <p>My <a href="https://diyrobocars.com/">DIYRobocars</a> autonomous RC car has come a long
way since my <a href="https://www.a1k0n.net/2018/11/13/fast-line-following.html">last post</a> on the subject.
I want to highlight a localization algorithm I came up with which works really
well, at least in this specific setting. I’ve been using it in races for a
while and it really stepped up the speeds I was able to achieve without the car
getting “lost” – about 22mph on the front straight of this small track. It
makes use of a fisheye camera looking towards the ceiling, and a localization
update runs in about 1ms at 640x480 on a Raspberry Pi 3, with precision on the
order of a few centimeters.</p>

<p>Here is a recent race against <a href="https://twitter.com/SmallPixelCar">another car</a>
which is about as fast, except it uses LIDAR to localize using the traffic
cones as landmarks. (My car previously localized using the cones as well,
except using a monocular camera, but the ceiling lights are much better when we
have them. Cone-based localization deserves a blog post of its own.) It’s a
three lap head-to-head race where there’s an extra random cone on the track. We
haven’t developed passing strategies yet though, so there are frequent racing
incidents…</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PsfkLj527Go" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><em>DIYRobocars race on March 7, 2020. We had a little accident but my car (blue)
somehow made it through unscathed… I finished my three laps just to record a
time for that heat.</em></p>

<p>I put a fisheye lens Raspberry Pi camera out the front windshield of a 1/10
scale touring car. It’s mounted sideways because it has a wider field of view
horizontally, and I wanted more pixels looking towards the front so I could see
a bit of the ground ahead. (Full hardware details are on <a href="https://github.com/a1k0n/cycloid/">the github
repo</a>.) Here is what it looks like without
the lid:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.a1k0n.net/img/cycloid_hw.jpg" alt="RC car hardware"></p>

<p>I record telemetry and video in each race, which I can then replay through a
<a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">Dear ImGui</a>-based tool:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgfW2d5h_GI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In the lower-right corner of the video is a virtual view of the car’s position
and speed, entirely derived from the ceiling light localization algorithm.</p>

<p>With the fisheye lens, it can see a <em>lot</em> of ceiling lights from any point on
the track, and they’re all set up in a regular grid with one or two exceptions.
The algorithm is robust to extra lights being added, lights being burned out,
and other cars flying over the top of the camera (watch closely at 0:07),
without losing tracking.</p>

<p>Since it’s hard to tell what’s going on from the raw, sideways fisheye camera,
the tool has an option to use <code>cv2.undistort</code> and remap the image as if it were
looking straight out the front windshield:</p>

<p>To make this practical at high FPS on a Raspberry Pi, I chose to make some
simplifying assumptions: assume all the ceiling lights are point sources on a
perfectly even grid, and that the camera moves along the floor at a fixed
height. This turned out to be good enough to work in practice. The method
doesn’t necessarily require an even grid, it just needs to be able to determine
the distance to the nearest landmark from any point. In a grid, that’s trivial,
but it’s not hard to use a map of the ceiling layout instead.</p>

<p>I also assumed I knew the grid size ahead of time, since I can just measure the
ceiling tile sizes and count the spaces between lights, and also measure the
height of the ceiling from the camera.</p>

<p>Further, the setting allows us to initialize the algorithm approximately at a
known location, namely the starting line. If the pattern of lights is perfectly
regular, there’s no way to tell which grid cell you started in, so we have to
assume we’re at the one containing the start of the race when we reset our
state.</p>


<p><img src="https://www.a1k0n.net/img/ceiltrack-undistort.jpg" alt="undistorting fisheye"></p>

<p>The first step is to deal with the lens distortion. This is particularly
obvious when using a fisheye lens, but every lens should be calibrated. OpenCV
provides <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/db/d58/group__calib3d__fisheye.html">a
module</a> for
calibrating converting from distorted/undistorted fisheye coordinates.</p>

<p>I won’t go too much into camera calibration here, but what I do is print <a href="https://github.com/a1k0n/cycloid/blob/master/tools/camcal/calboard.png">this
ArUco calibration
target</a>,
take still photos of it from several angles, and use <a href="https://github.com/a1k0n/cycloid/blob/master/tools/camcal/cal.py">this
script</a> to
get the camera intrinsic parameters.</p>

<p>With those parameters, you can use several OpenCV utilities to do things like
undistort images (shown above) or compute ideal pinhole camera ray vectors from
each pixel with <code>cv2.undistortPoints</code>.</p>

<p>In my tracking code, the initialization step computes a lookup table with the
supplied camera parameters. For each pixel, the lookup table has a \(\left[x,
y, 1\right]\) vector which forms a ray in 3D space starting at the camera and
heading out towards the ceiling. There is also a circular mask to filter out
pixels pointing too far away from the ceiling.</p>

<p>Note that the tracking code does <em>not</em> use <code>cv2.undistortImage</code> or equivalent.
The illustration above shows what undistorting the whole image does: objects
far away from the camera with relatively small numbers of pixels in the source
image take up a large number of blurry pixels in the output, and the objects
directly in front taking up most of the image are a small portion of the
output. What I want to do is give equal weight to each pixel in the source
image, and less weight to potential outliers. That way, the lights directly
above the camera are mostly what it will try to track on, which gives better
accuracy.</p>

<p>Once the lookup table is available, the problem reduces to matching a 2D grid
to all the corrected pixel locations for all pixels within the mask which look
like ceiling lights, meaning the grayscale pixel is brighter than some
threshold. The mask is necessary to deal with reflections from the car’s body
and light from nearby windows – it makes sure we’re only looking upwards for
ceiling lights.</p>



<p><img src="https://www.a1k0n.net/img/ceiltrack-iteration.png" alt="aligning a grid to ceiling lights"><br>
<em>Grid alignment objective. Blue dots: initial uninitialized configuration \([u,
v, \theta] = (0, 0, 0)\); orange dots: fit after five iterations of
the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm described below. Left: the grid dots are
transformed back into the fisheye distortion here to show the fit on the
original image. Right: the fit in undistorted space.</em></p>

<p>We can solve this with the same hammer we pound on all the other nails with in
computer vision: nonlinear least squares via
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenberg%E2%80%93Marquardt_algorithm">Levenberg-Marquardt</a>,
which is a fancy name for the ordinary least squares algorithm with a
simple tweak to make sure it converges.</p>

<p>The vehicle state is defined as \([u, v, \theta]\) where \(u, v\) are the
position within the grid along the \(x\) and \(y\) axes respectively, and
\(\theta\) is the heading angle of the vehicle. We’ll also define \(x_{spc}\)
and \(y_{spc}\) as the grid spacing in each axis.</p>

<p>Conceptually, if we superimpose a grid with that spacing on the ceiling, rotate
it by \(-\theta\) around the center and then translate it by \([-u, -v]\), the
grid should line up with the pixels in our image which are above the “white”
threshold.</p>

<p>To do the optimization, we start with an initial guess for \([u, v, \theta\)]
and repeat two steps: First, find the nearest grid point to every transformed
white pixel, and then solve for an updated \([u, v, \theta]\) to minimize the
residuals. Solving for \([u, v, \theta]\) may cause some pixels to match
different grid points, so repeating the two steps a few times is usually
necessary, otherwise it would be solved in closed form. In practice, once the
algorithm is “synced up”, only two iterations are really necessary to keep up
with tracking.</p>

<p>Let’s define a residual for every undistorted white pixel \([x_i, y_i]\)
measuring the distance to the closest grid point \([g_{xi}, g_{yi}]\):</p>

\[\mathbf{r}_i = \begin{bmatrix}\cos{\theta} &amp; \sin{\theta}\\-\sin{\theta} &amp; \cos{\theta}\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}x_i \\ y_i \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix}u \\ v \end{bmatrix} -
\begin{bmatrix}g_{xi} \\ g_{yi} \end{bmatrix}\]

<p>This says: Rotate each pixel \([x_i, y_i]\) by the car’s heading angle
\(\theta\), subtract the car’s position \([u, v]\), and compare it to the grid
point we think it should be on \([g_{xi}, g_{yi}]\). We want to minimize the
sum of the squares of all residuals, \(\sum_{i} \mathbf{r}_{i}^\top \mathbf{r}_i\).</p>

<p>(Note: \([x_i, y_i]\) here are the pixels after undoing the camera transform /
distortion, so they are not pixel coordinates but rather normalized
coordinates. You can think of it as a ray shooting from the camera intersecting
a plane 1 unit in front of the camera; (1, 0) would thus be a ray 45-degree
angle to the right of center shooting out of the camera.)</p>

<p>If we’re fitting to a grid, then \([g_{xi}, g_{yi}]\) can be found simply by
taking the transformed point modulo the grid spacing \(x_{spc}, y_{spc}\). In
principle, any pattern of landmarks, not just grids, can be used here.</p>

<p>Here’s my Python prototype implementation that finds the nearest grid point:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>moddist</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>q</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>q</span><span>/</span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>%</span><span>q</span> <span>-</span> <span>q</span><span>/</span><span>2</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>gxi</span><span>,</span> <span>gyi</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To do the least-squares minimization, we need to compute the Jacobian (a fancy
word for the derivative of a vector with respect to a vector) of the residuals,
which is simple enough. I used <a href="https://www.sympy.org/">SymPy</a> in a Jupyter

<span>r</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

\[\left[\begin{matrix}- g_{x i} - u + x_{i} \cos{\left(\theta \right)} + y_{i} \sin{\left(\theta \right)}\\- g_{y i} - v - x_{i} \sin{\left(\theta \right)} + y_{i} \cos{\left(\theta \right)}\end{matrix}\right]\]

<p>Now, to actually compute our least squares update, we need to compute
\(\delta = \left(\sum_i \mathbf{J}_i^\top \mathbf{J}_i + \lambda \mathbf{I}
\right)^{-1} \left(\sum_i \mathbf{J}_i^\top \mathbf{r}_i\right)\). Looks
complicated, but what it means is we need to add a up contribution for …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

They downloaded all articles that documented corporate scandals involving the term “sexual harassment” or its synonyms. These included for example “sexual misconduct” or “indecent assault.”</p><p>This resulted in a data set of almost 15,000 articles. Many of these articles involved privately held firms, or articles where the term “sexual harassment” occurred in an irrelevant context. These articles were discarded. The researchers also discarded articles about companies that were facing bankruptcy around the time of the scandal (but for reasons unrelated to the scandal), and other confounding factors such as activist investors attempting to gain control of a company’s board.</p><h2>From consumer favorites to financial powerhouses</h2><p>The researchers ultimately wound up with a list of 199 sexual harassment scandals. These included many household names, such as Disney, Tesla, Amazon, Google, and <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/study-claims-72-accuracy-in-predicting-someones-political-orientation-based-on-a-single-photo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a>. The list also included financial firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, and popular media brands including The New York Times, Fox, and CBS.</p><p>About 78% of the scandals took place in the US, and another 18% in other English-speaking countries. The accuser was a female in 88% of the cases; 73% of cases had only one accuser. The data set included roughly equal numbers of physical and non-physical harassment cases. The accused personnel were CEOs (14%), other executives (26%), or non-executives (60%).</p><h2><strong>The economic costs of sexual harassment</strong> <strong>in numbers</strong></h2><p>The researchers found “a negative 1.5% cumulative abnormal return over the event day and the following trading day.” For the roughly 200 companies in their sample, that corresponded to an average impact of $450&nbsp;million.</p><p>In the long term, the companies hit by such a scandal recovered only about half of that lost market value. The long-term average was a 0.8% loss, worth on average about $250&nbsp;million.</p><h2><strong>Emergence of the #MeToo movement</strong></h2><p>The study also found the impact of sexual harassment scandals on company value was about the same both before and after the emergence of the #MeToo movement. The paper dates that mergence as October 5, 2017. That is the day that The New York Times published its first article about the systematic sexual misconduct of Harvey Weinstein.</p><p>In contrast, the number of sexual harassment scandals at public companies has quadrupled since the emergence of the #MeToo movement. About 45% of the cases in this data set took place after October 2017.</p><p>Furthermore, the study also found that the market impact was lower in countries with lower levels of gender equality.</p><h2><strong>What raises or lowers the</strong> <strong>economic costs of sexual harassment</strong>?</h2><p>The involvement of a CEO in the scandal was a consistent driver of negative returns, adding an additional 5% drop in company value. Similarly, more media attention also corresponded to greater losses.</p><p>On the other hand, instances where companies self-disclosed the misconduct before it was discovered by the media were punished considerably less by the market. The market reaction was also less severe in cases where the accused CEO left the firm, versus staying on.</p><p>The study found that these losses stem mostly from damage to the firm’s reputation and public sentiment, rather than the costs of penalties and compensation claims, or the costs associated with the loss of expensive personnel.</p><p>In terms of damage control, the authors found that “immediate attempts at reputational repair are associated with alleviated market responses.” In other words, “the reputational effect and impact on public sentiment is an important channel of impact on market value” for companies embroiled in such a scandal.</p><p>In sum, the authors conclude, “there is a highly significant negative market reaction to sexual harassment scandals that can wipe off enormous amounts of market value in a matter of days.”</p><p>And these findings should put to rest “any remaining contemplation among managers and investors about whether sexual harassment is a real business risk,” they write. “The impact is shown to be both real and economically significant.”</p><hr><p><strong>Study: </strong>“#MeToo: Sexual harassment and company value”<br><strong>Authors:</strong> Mads Borelli-Kjaer, Laurids Moehl Schack, and Ulf Nielsson<br><strong>Published in:</strong> <em><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-corporate-finance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of Corporate Finance</a></em><br><strong>Publication date: </strong>January 6, 2021<br><strong>DOI:</strong> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2020.101875" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2020.101875</a><br><strong>Photo:</strong> by&nbsp;<a href="https://pixabay.com/users/mohamed_hassan-5229782/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=4499303">Mohamed Hassan</a>&nbsp;via&nbsp;<a href="https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=4499303">Pixabay</a>&nbsp;</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

Vancouver seaplane company says its retro-fitted all electric airplane is set to take to the skies for more test flights this year, as it pushes forward with its plans to make commercial air travel cheaper and greener.</p>  <p>"There's no wavering in our confidence and determination and interest in getting this done," said Harbour Air&nbsp;CEO Greg McDougall.</p>  <p>Founded by McDougall in 1982, Harbour Air uses small propeller planes to fly commercial flights between the Lower Mainland, Seattle, Vancouver Island, the Gulf Islands and Whistler.</p>  <p>In the last few years it has <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/world-s-first-all-electric-commercial-seaplane-set-for-takeoff-in-richmond-1.5378163" target="_blank">turned its attention to becoming a leader in green urban mobility</a>, which would do away with the need to burn fossil fuels for air travel.</p>  <p>In December 2019, McDougall flew one of Harbour Air's planes, a more than 60-year-old &nbsp;DHC-2 de Havilland Beaver float plane, which had been outfitted with a Seattle-based company's electric propulsion system, for three minutes over Richmond B.C.</p>  <p><span><span><div><div

over the Fraser River for three minutes today in its debut test flight.<!-- --> <!-- -->0:26</span></span></span></p>  <p>Harbour Air joined with Seattle-based company MagniX in early 2019 to design the e-plane's engine, which was powered by NASA-approved lithium-ion batteries that were also used on the International Space Station.</p>  <p>At the time, based on the success of that inaugural flight, McDougall had hoped to be using the plane to fly passengers on its routes, such as between downtown Vancouver and downtown Victoria, by the end of this year.</p>  <p>Now, that timeline has been pushed back at least one year due to the pandemic.</p>  <p>"It's progressing, not as quickly as we hoped due to COVID, but we are getting back on track with the testing program," said McDougall.</p>    <p>Harbour Air has to prove to Transport Canada that its e-plane is as safe as its other conventional planes to allow it to fly with passengers.</p>  <p>McDougall says Ottawa has approved a new permit to allow the company to continue with test flights this year, which will be used to improve the plane and all its components.</p>  <h2>New batteries</h2>  <p>Despite the setback from the pandemic, the company stands to benefit from advances in battery technology.</p>  <p>It has partnered with a new company for a different battery that is lighter and provides more power than what was used a year ago.</p>  <p>Analysts of the sector say the success of companies like Harbour Air to fly all-electric in a commercially successful way is completely dependent upon the energy system.</p>  <p>"Technologically, the real challenge is to make the batteries lighter," said Werner Antweiler, a professor of economics at UBC's&nbsp;Sauder School of Business who studies the commercialization of novel technologies around mobility.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt=""

on quickly meets its weight capacity even without passengers.</p>  <p>McDougall says battery technology is advancing quickly and he expects them to be even lighter and more powerful, as his project gets closer to flying commercially.</p>  <p>Antweiler says Harbour Air is in the "sweet spot" in the industry as its flights are short, meaning battery technology as it stands today makes the project viable.</p>  <p>"That is an ideal application because the batteries won't get you any farther than that range," he said about the length of flights Harbour Air does.</p>  <p>Getting on an all-electric

In
<a href="https://www.arun.is/blog/apple-watch">my review of the Apple Watch Series 6</a>, I described how it
sits at the confluence of design, technology, lifestyle, and watchmaking. This
perfect blend of so many different disciplines and constraints puts it in a
category all by itself.</p><p>Apple did this not by taking an age-old wristwatch silhouette and cramming some
electronics in it. Instead, they carefully reimagined every aspect, from the
user interaction patterns to the mechanism securing the interchangeable bands,
the digital crown, the variety of cases and bands, and the use of watch terms
like “complication” in the user experience.</p><p>In particular, the analog faces reveal what Apple does so well — taking the
familiar and making it their own. Over the years, they have released quite a few
faces with roots in history. Each one started as an iconic watch archetype and
was remade to take advantage of the Apple Watch platform.</p><h2 id="watch-terminology">Watch terminology</h2><p>Before jumping into the Apple Watch, let’s review some useful watch terminology.</p><p><span><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/502880983?background=1" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="" title="vimeo video"></iframe></span></p><p>Some additional terms that were difficult to illustrate:</p><ol><li><strong>Case:</strong> The case is the enclosure that houses the watch internals and
around which everything else is attached.</li><li><strong>Movement:</strong> The movement is the heart of the watch. It is the mechanism in
charge of keeping time and running any complications.</li><li><strong>Subdial:</strong> Subdials are smaller dials within the main dial. They are often
used to track the seconds or power reserve.</li><li><strong>Complication:</strong> This term refers to any function aside from time-keeping,
such as the date, or moonphase.</li><li><strong>Crystal:</strong> The crystal is the clear material that protects the watch dial.
Crystals are usually made of plastic, mineral glass, or synthetic sapphire,
which has a hardness only topped by diamond.</li><li><strong>Reference number:</strong> Similar to model numbers in other products, the
reference number can be used to identify the model, material, dial,
movement, and more. Often, collectors use reference numbers instead of names
in order to be specific.</li></ol><h2 id="the-main-elements-of-an-apple-watch-face">The main elements of an Apple Watch face</h2><p>Continuing on, to appreciate what makes each of Apple’s historically-derived
faces unique, let’s start by understanding what they have in common. They come
in two primary shapes, rectangular and circular.</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="intro shapes" title="intro shapes" src="https://www.arun.is/static/672c57426cb2258381db7b34c1c330d7/20801/intro_shapes.jpg" srcset="https://www.arun.is/static/672c57426cb2258381db7b34c1c330d7/98e5d/intro_shapes.jpg 180w,https://www.arun.is/static/672c57426cb2258381db7b34c1c330d7/543cd/intro_shapes.jpg 360w,https://www.arun.is/static/672c57426cb2258381db7b34c1c330d7/20801/intro_shapes.jpg 720w,https://www.arun.is/static/672c57426cb2258381db7b34c1c330d7/b37e7/intro_shapes.jpg 1080w,https://www.arun.is/static/672c57426cb2258381db7b34c1c330d7/33266/intro_shapes.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>Some faces integrate both the dial and bezel on screen, which is likely why
Apple decided to call them faces instead of dials.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>Regardless of the shape, they employ the same hands in slightly different color
combinations. Most have hour, minute, and second hands. Some hands are solid,
while others are outlined with a contrasting color on the inside as if using
luminous material.</p><p><span>
      <span></span>

date or moon phase but can include the weather, fitness stats, and custom
complications from third-party applications.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>Lastly, the wearer can choose a color scheme for each face from an extensive set
of pre-made color combinations.</p><p>Let’s dive into five Apple Watch faces — California, Chronograph, Chronograph
Pro, Count Up, and GMT.</p><h2 id="california">California&nbsp;</h2><h3 id="the-history-of-the-california-dial">The history of the California dial</h3><p>The California face is not a reference, as some may think, to Apple’s
headquarters, but in fact, to a dial design originating during World War II.</p><p>Originally called the “error proof” or “high visibility” dial, it adorned the
fronts of
<a href="https://www.bobswatches.com/rolex-blog/watch-review/rolex-bubble-back.html">“bubble back”</a>
Rolexes — so-called because of the bubble-shaped back that gave the watches a
thin appearance. Strikingly, the indices are set both in Roman and Arabic
numerals where other watches would stick to one or the other. It’s thought that
mixing numerals aids both the wearer and his brothers-in-arms in reading the
watch in low visibility conditions.</p><p><span>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronometer_watch">chronometers</a>, chronographs
are watches that can be used as stopwatches. In other words, they can measure
elapsed time. As tool watches, they sit at the top in popularity, finding use in
various situations like car racing, horse racing, etc.</p><p>The word chronograph comes from the Greek words “khrónos” or time and “gráphō”
or to write<sup id="4"><a href="#footnote_4">[4]</a></sup>. For most of history,
it was accepted that the first chronograph was designed by Nicolas Mathieu
Rieussec in 1822 for King Louis XVIII to time his

to mark an arc on the dial to visualized elapsed time.</p><p><span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Clean code is like clean garbage – it’s only truly clean if it doesn’t exist. In other words, the only clean code is <a aria-label="no code (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">no code</a>. Let’s start with an acknowledgment that a perfectly clean (empty) codebase is useless. With that in mind, our pursuit of clean code will necessarily consist of tradeoffs. We’ll trade usefulness for cleanliness, complexity for speed, ownership for ease of development, and abstractions for reusability.</p>
<p>DRY (don’t repeat yourself) code is often held aloft as an ideal in the quest for clean code. Before we jump in too deep, let me shamelessly plug my new computer science learning platform <a href="https://qvault.io/">Qvault</a>, check it out if you like CS and like to write code. With that over with, let’s explore why I think DRY can be a good <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/11/30/examples-of-heuristics-in-computer-science/">heuristic</a>, but far from an absolute.</p>
<h2>What is DRY Code?</h2>
<p>According to <a aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Don’t repeat yourself</strong>&nbsp;is a principle aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns,&nbsp;replacing it with abstractions or using&nbsp;data normalization&nbsp;to avoid redundancy. Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.</p></blockquote>
<p>While this definition is fairly exhaustive, what I’ve found people <em>usually</em> mean when they say “DRY code” is that when you find yourself repeating pieces of logic you should instead create a reusable function, interface, class, etc, so that you only have to maintain one copy of it. For example, take the following API calls:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">export async function updateUserHandle(handle) {
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  return await fetch(`${domain}/v1/users/handle`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      handle
    })
  });
}

export async function updateUserInterests(interestUUIDs) {
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  return await fetch(`${domain}/v1/users/interests`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      interestUUIDs
    })
  });
}</code></pre>
<p>You may have noticed, but the beginning of those two API calls are nearly identical – they handle some basic logic that checks to see if the user is properly authenticated and sends that authentication in the request. This might not be a big deal with just two API calls, but what if we have 30? Or maybe 1000? Instead, we can DRY up this code by writing a simple <code>fetchWithAuth</code> function that will centralize all the client’s authentication logic in a single place:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">async function fetchWithAuth(url, params){
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  if (!params.headers){
    params.headers = {};
  }
  params.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  return await fetch(url, params);
}

export async function updateUserHandle(handle) {
  return await fetchWithAuth(`${domain}/v1/users/handle`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      handle
    })
  });
}

export async function updateUserInterests(interestUUIDs) {
  return await fetchWithAuth(`${domain}/v1/users/interests`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      interestUUIDs
    })
  });
}</code></pre>
<h2>Why wouldn’t you DRY out your code?</h2>
<p>Seems like a good idea to reduce code duplication right? Well, yes, in general it is. That said, lets look at some of the drawbacks that come along with too much centralization.</p>
<h3>1. Too many abstractions</h3>
<p>Sometimes code is the same at a given point in time, but later on, it becomes distinct in some way. It’s really hard to guarantee that duplicate code will remain perfect copies of each other forever. A hypothetical example of this would be if the Facebook and Instagram APIs had the exact same way to create a social post. Just because they’re <em>coincidentally</em> the same, probably doesn’t mean that the logic should only be written once.</p>
<p>The solution is likely to remain disciplined about splitting out code that, while it may be similar, is only <em>coincidentally</em> similar. Try to only merge code that’s <em>fundamentally</em> the same. A great example would be a math function like <code>log2</code>. That function should work for every case that you need to calculate a logarithm – each call is fundamentally the same.</p>
<h3>2. External dependency creation</h3>
<p>If two different projects share the same logic, it can often make sense to centralize it in a library package. While this is often a great idea, it can add overhead and can end up being more trouble than it’s worth. For example, even if the abstraction makes sense, you’re definitely adding at least the following complexity to the project:</p>
<ul><li>Management of the dependencies versions and running updates regularly</li><li>Requires multi-project updates in order to get a new change to a specific dependent</li><li>Often involves more remote infrastructure like NPM or PyPy</li><li>Gets harder to make “breaking” changes to the libraries core functions – requires a higher standard of code quality and architecture</li></ul>
<h3>3. Localization complexity</h3>
<p>When debugging or reading code, it would be easiest if the flow of logic started at the top of a file and flowed in a linear path. For example:</p>
<pre><code>START PROGRAM
INSTRUCTION 0
INSTRUCTION 1
INSTRUCTION 2
INSTRUCTION 3
END PROGRAM</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, in useful programs, we need functions, classes, methods, type definitions, etc. that force us to read and write code in a non-linear way. The goal should be to keep everything as linear as possible and sacrifice linearity and simplicity for reusability and separation of concerns as necessary. Every time we extract a chunk of code from a larger function into a smaller more encapsulated one, the code becomes just a little bit harder to follow.</p>
<p>With a highly compartmentalized project, when we see a function called <code>getUser</code>, if we want to <em>really</em> know what’s going on we have to peek into that function and remember the current context because we’re now looking at a different file. Obviously, the cognitive burden becomes greater and greater the more definitions you need to jump through.</p>
<h2>Takeaways – Code smells and hueristics</h2>
<p>Since no code is perfect, we can need to make use of some heuristics (rules of thumb), to try to work towards a cleaner codebase.</p>
<h3>1. WET code, or the rule of three</h3>
<p>WET is a better rule of thumb in my opinion than DRY.</p>
<p>WET stands for “write everything twice”, and forces you to think a bit harder about whether or not a piece of logic deserves an abstraction. The rule of three is an alternative that says you should even wait until you’ve written something three times before breaking it out.</p>
<h3>2. Is it testable?</h3>
<p>Most functions should be predictable and testable. They should behave like math functions or <a aria-label="pure functions (opens in a new tab)" href="https://qvault.io/2020/09/07/how-to-make-pure-functions-in-go/#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20Pure%20Function,of%20data%20outside%20the%20function)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pure functions</a> – given a set of inputs you’ll always receive the same outputs, and the state of the program isn’t mutated. If the code you’re thinking about condensing into a function can be a pure function, then it’s likely a better idea than if it were an impure function.</p>
<p>Pure functions are really easy to write good unit tests for – if your abstraction is easily testable it’s more likely to be a good abstraction.</p>
<h3>3. Are there special cases or arguments only used by a fraction of callers?</h3>
<p>Take a look at the following example:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getArea(height, width){
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>This is a great function! Its very simple, and obviously can be used to calculate the area of any shape. Here’s a bad example:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getArea(height, width, isTriangle){
  if (isTriangle){
    return (height * width) / 2
  }
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>Special cases are bad news – I’m trying to be too abstract. Instead I should just create two separate functions:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getTriangleArea(height, width){
  return (height * width) / 2
}

function getRectangleArea(height, width){
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>Have any more ideas for good rules of thumb? Let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/wagslane" target="_blank" aria-label="Twitter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>! I’d love to update and improve this article.</p>

I’ve created a theme template and using Hugo I can easily generate a complete website. The generated website is then uploaded to a public B2 cloud bucket. Access to the website hosted in the B2 bucket is then provided through Cloudflare.</p><p>Taking advantage of the bandwidth alliance between B2 and Cloudflare gives free outbound bandwidth from B2 and inexpensive storage of your data. Currently B2 cloud charges $5 per month for 1TB of data and up to 10GB for free. Cloudflare workers are free up to 100,000 daily requests then it’s $5 per month for a few million requests and an additional 50 cents per million requests. This means the website can serve millions of requests per month for less than $10 per month.</p><h4 id="creating-the-website-bucket">Creating the website bucket</h4><p>After creating an account on B2 cloud create a new bucket and enable public access. Create an application key and give it access to the newly created bucket. Note down the application key and ID as they will be needed in the following steps.</p><h4 id="creating-the-hugo-website">Creating the Hugo website</h4><p>Hugo is a powerful static site generation tool with a large community and many free themes available. It has a powerful template engine and content management tools.</p><p>I created this websites current theme using Hugo templates and found it very enjoyable once I got more familiar with Hugo template order precedence.</p><p>Once the Hugo static website is ready you can build the static files with the <code>hugo</code> command. This generates the HTML files from the templates and content into a public directory.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">❯ hugo

In order to match the routes created in the website we can use Cloudflare Workers to handle the inbound requests. This also gives the ability to modify the request to remove some B2 debugging headers and do some error handling such as serving the 404.html page.</p><p>You will need to configure a domain in Cloudflare for the website. Then create a new worker and routes to send requests to the domain to the worker. Configure the domain with a CNAME record pointing to the domain of the B2 bucket.</p><p><img src="https://roote.ca/about/tutorials/static-site/cloudflare_static.png" alt="Cloudflare DNS setting"></p><p>In the site configuration page rules section ensure cache level is set to everything and automatic HTTPS rewrites are enabled.</p><p><img src="https://roote.ca/about/tutorials/static-site/cloudflare_page_rules.png" alt="Cloudflare Page Rules"></p><p>I’ve based the worker code off of this great example found <a href="https://jross.me/free-personal-image-hosting-with-backblaze-b2-and-cloudflare-workers/">here.</a> Using this code with some small modifications allows you to use B2 as the web server with full caching in the Cloudflare network.</p><p>I’ve made some modifications to allow serving the index.html page without specifying it directly as one limitation of B2 cloud is that there isn’t a concept of an index page for HTTP requests. I’ve also added some checks to see if the request to B2 gives a 404 error, if so it will return the 404 page included with the website. This prevents a user from seeing the 404 page directly from the B2 cloud bucket.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>'use strict'</span>;

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
		Share </p><p>Early my career, a CFO asked me a very good question. “If IT can’t deliver a return on investment that is better than what I could get by putting corporate monies into a bank savings account, then why would I want to invest in IT?”</p>
<p>At the time, I didn’t have a good answer. In fact, I was a bit embarrassed. But looking back, I realize that he was absolutely right.</p>
<p>Is your IT organization delivering a good return on investment? Or is your IT organization being silently killed?</p>
<h2><strong>Where does IT spend the business’ money?</strong></h2>
<p>If I look at the broad categories of IT spend, there are three categories where IT spends the business’ money:</p>
<p><strong>KTLO</strong>, or <strong>K</strong>eeping <strong>T</strong>he <strong>L</strong>ights <strong>O</strong>n, can be thought of as the cost of doing business. All other things remaining equal, KTLO is spend that typically fluctuates little on a year to year basis. This category includes spending on things like support contracts, salaries, training, regulatory and legal compliance, and maintenance and support activities to keep current systems running optimally.</p>
<p><strong>Innovation</strong> represents investments in technology. This type of spend includes initiatives like new systems, new lines of business, technology enablement of new business products, mergers and acquisitions, or significant expansions of existing services. This can be thought of as “grow the business” or “transform the business” kinds of spend.</p>
<p>What is the third category of IT spending?</p>
<p><strong>Break-fix. </strong>Break-fix represents spending related to failed changes. Recurring incidents. Major incidents. Failed deployments. Re-work. Poor quality.</p>
<p>When technology breaks, or changes fail, or an issue occurs that interrupts the business’ ability to do business, IT must stop whatever it is doing and fix the issue. Granted, some (hopefully limited) number of outages and failures should be expected. After all, technology ages and at some point, may fail. Business situations emerge in ways that software was perhaps not designed to manage. The bottom line is that when things break, IT has to fix what’s broken.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing. Regardless of whether IT is spending its time KTLO, innovating, or fixing, it<em> all pays the same</em>. To say it differently, an organization’s IT personnel are paid the same, regardless of what they’re working on.</p>
<p>Here’s the other thing. CFOs expect IT to deliver within its annual budget. IT doesn’t get more budget money to spend, just because it’s spending more money “fixing” rather than “innovating”.</p>
<p>If you’re the CFO, where would you like to see IT spending its time? Certainly not on “break-fix”.</p>
<h2><strong>What is the impact?</strong></h2>
<p>What happens when fixing issues and constant rework becomes (nearly) a way of life for the IT organization?</p>
<p>Well, two things.</p>
<p>First, remember those innovation projects that had been planned? When IT spends more time on “fixing”, those innovation projects get broken out into subprojects in the hopes of getting “something” rather than “nothing” done. Or they get delayed until the next budget cycle.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or they get outsourced to someone else. Or they don’t get done at all. Why? Because IT is too busy with rework and fixing, it has no time to work on the innovation that the business requested.</p>
<p>Second, the reputation and credibility of the IT organization become damaged. While some in IT may be (briefly) recognized for their <a href="https://www.dougtedder.com/2015/05/02/we-dont-need-another-hero/">heroic efforts</a> in “putting out the fires”, the longer-term damage is being done. IT becomes perceived as being too reactive, inconsistent, incompetent, and unreliable.</p>
<h2><strong>Are the silent killers evident at your IT organization?</strong></h2>
<p>I just finished reading “The Art of Business Value” by Mark Schwartz<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>. In the book, Schwartz described the abstracted total of IT capabilities for many organizations – software, infrastructure, the whole bit – as a giant hairball. This giant hairball is continually getting new pieces stuck to it – and not all of it pretty. The hairball clearly has value to the organization – it enables the business! – but the hairball is continually becoming more and more difficult to manage.</p>
<p>And, in my opinion, it’s this hairball that is silently killing IT.</p>
<p>“Break-fix” is just one thing that is silently killing IT. What are some other silent killers?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uneven effort</strong>. There are often overlapping efforts by those in IT – multiple people doing similar activities. Or even worse – there are gaps in effort. Things that should be getting done, but are not.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of transparency</strong>. No one is able to identify what happens to investments in IT. No one can adequately describe the value proposition of IT. All the business knows is that it spends monies on IT. It’s not consistently clear of what is coming out of IT.</li>
<li><strong>Increased spending in KTLO</strong>. Because systems aren’t being retired, or new applications or technologies are continually being bolted-on to legacy systems, the cost just to keep the lights on rises from year to year.</li>
<li><strong>Inability to respond </strong>to changing business needs in a timely fashion. IT is unable to deploy new or updated technology in the timeframes or in a manner required by business.</li>
<li><strong>IT personnel lack business acumen</strong>. IT people think and talk only in terms of “bits and bytes” and have no ability to relate technology efforts to business outcomes and value.</li>
<li><strong>Avoidance</strong>. From the business perspective, it’s too darn difficult to do business with IT. So, the business doesn’t invite IT to strategy discussions. “Shadow” technology projects pop up within business areas, or aspects of technology use are outsourced.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Silencing the Silent Killers</strong></h2>
<p>IT organizations are complex and ever-evolving. And while all of the current talk of IT needing to be more agile and responsive is well and good, the fact remains that most IT organizations are stuck grooming a hairball. And it’s that hairball that is killing the IT organization.&nbsp;&nbsp; What can the IT organization do?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Define the service portfolio</strong>. Identify and capture the business outcomes, total cost of ownership, needed resources, and business value of what IT does in the service portfolio. Not only will this illustrate how technology provides business value, it will also help identify areas of technical debt and help with informed decision-making regarding the use of technology within the organization.</li>
<li><strong>Develop business acumen</strong>. Understanding the business of the business – and the contribution that technology makes to the business – is critical for survival of the IT organization. Talk with business colleagues in business terms!</li>
<li><strong>Formally define processes</strong>. If there ever was anything close to a silver bullet for IT challenges, having defined processes might just be it. First, defined processes help IT understand what is to be done and by whom. Defined processes document and enable flow. Lastly, defined processes enable automation, which helps IT become more responsive to business demands.</li>
<li><strong>Make regular payments on technical debt</strong>. Unabated, the IT hairball will only become worse. IT must dedicate focused efforts to pay down the organization’s technical debt. This should include activities such as kaizens, re-architecting systems from being monolithic to being more modular, and allocating part of all new project spend toward retirement (and shutdown) of non-necessary legacy systems.</li>
<li><strong>Unleash your “inner salesperson”</strong>. If you’re unable to promote the value of IT, you can’t expect anyone outside of IT to perceive value. Continually sell the value proposition of the IT organization.&nbsp;&nbsp; Be able to answer why investment in IT is a good thing for the organization. What will your CFO see as the return in the investment of the business’ monies into IT?</li>
</ul>
<p>What makes the silent killers of IT so dangerous is the fact that IT organizations don’t recognize them…until it is too late. Don’t let your IT organization fall victim to these silent killers. My five actions for stopping the silent killers will help IT demonstrate a good return on investment for the business.</p>

January 25, 2021 | https://sethdandridge.com/blog/redefining-pythons-print-function | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sethdandridge.com/blog/redefining-pythons-print-function">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Every novice Pythonista is familiar with the trusty built-in function <code>print()</code>. Its job is simple: output the string representation of an object or expression.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'the answer is'</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>
<span>'the answer is 3'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>But let’s say you want to change the behavior of print. Instead of sending its output to the terminal, let’s send that output to a file on the disk. We can accomplish this by redefining the print variable.</p>



<p>The full function signature of print is:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>objects</span><span>,</span> <span>sep</span><span>=</span><span>' '</span><span>,</span> <span>end</span><span>=</span><span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>file</span><span>=</span><span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>stdout</span><span>,</span> <span>flush</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Note the third keyword argument, <code>file</code>. The default value of <code>file</code> is <code>sys.stdout</code>, which represents the terminal output buffer. The only real requirement for the object passed to <code>file</code> is that it has a <code>.write()</code> method. You know what has a write method? File handlers.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'log.txt'</span><span>,</span> <span>'a+'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span># f is a file handler
</span>    <span>f</span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>'the answer is'</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s redefine the print variable to instead be a wrapper function around the vanilla built-in <code>print()</code>. The wrapped <code>print()</code> needs to be referenced through the <code>builtins</code> module so that we don’t define a recursive function.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> <span>builtins</span>

<span>def</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>):</span>
    <span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'log.txt'</span><span>,</span> <span>'a+'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>builtins</span><span>.</span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>file</span><span>=</span><span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>)</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'the answer is'</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, when we call <code>print()</code>, no output is displayed in the terminal. However, if we read the contents of <code>log.txt</code>, we can see that our redefined <code>print()</code> has written to the file.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>$ </span><span>cat </span>log.txt
the answer is 3</code></pre></figure>



<p>Let’s make it weird. We can actually redefine <code>print()</code> to be a buffer object that stores all the strings that are passed to it for printing. Instead of a function, <code>print</code> will be an instance of a class that inherits <code>io.StringIO</code>.</p>

<p><code>StringIO</code> is a in-memory text buffer that works similarly to a file handler. In fact, file handlers and <code>StringIO</code> both implement the abstract base class <code>IOBase</code>, which means they have many of the same methods defined.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple example of how to use <code>StringIO</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> <span>io</span>

<span>buffer</span> <span>=</span> <span>io</span><span>.</span><span>StringIO</span><span>()</span>
<span>buffer</span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>'here is some input'</span><span>)</span>
<span>buffer</span><span>.</span><span>getvalue</span><span>()</span>
<span>'here is some input'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s define a new subclass of <code>StringIO</code> called <code>PrintWrapper</code>. We’re also going to define a <code>__call__</code> magic method on this new class. <code>__call__</code> allows you to define how an instance of a class behaves when it is called like a function.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> <span>builtins</span>
<span>import</span> <span>io</span>

<span>class</span> <span>PrintWrapper</span><span>(</span><span>io</span><span>.</span><span>StringIO</span><span>):</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>__call__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>):</span>
    <span># Pass the object instance (self) as the file
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>builtins</span><span>.</span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>file</span><span>=</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>)</span>

<span>print</span> <span>=</span> <span>PrintWrapper</span><span>()</span> <span># print is now the printer AND a buffer
</span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'this was added to buffer'</span><span>)</span>  <span># triggers print.__call__()
</span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'this was also added to the buffer'</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>.</span><span>getvalue</span><span>()</span>
<span>'this was added to buffer</span><span>\n</span><span>this was also added to buffer</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Strings that you have printed are seperated by <code>\n</code> when you call print.getvalue(), but you can define a different seperator by passing it as a string to the <code>end=</code> keyword argument of <code>builtins.print()</code>.</p>



<p>Why would you ever want to do any of this? Well, let’s say you are building a web-based programming environment like <a href="https://coderpad.io/">CoderPad</a>. When a user calls <code>print()</code>, you probably wouldn’t want the Python interpreter running on the server to send the printed statement to stdout. You might instead want it to be outputted to a handler that transmits it to the user’s browser over the Internet. There are probably other ways to accomplish this, but redefining <code>print()</code> behind the scenes is one possibility.</p>

<p>This is the first of a series of blog entries I’m calling “baby snakes”, bits of Python arcana aimed at intermediate and advanced Python developers. Please check back soon for more!</p>

How to make it more sustainable?</p><div><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/iter_fusion_reactor_plasma.jpg" alt="Figure 1: Inside the Korean tokamak KSTAR (NFRI)"><figcaption><p>Figure 1: Inside the Korean tokamak <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KSTAR">KSTAR</a> (NFRI)</p></figcaption></figure><p>With corporations like Microsoft, Oracle, and Google truly reinventing
themselves to adapt to an open source world, and typical open source
projects moving towards—oftentimes centralized—governance models, the
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/">Cathedral–Bazaar</a> dichotomy feels increasingly less relevant.</p><p>It was met with
<a href="https://firstmonday.org/article/view/708/618">criticism</a>
even back in the 90s.</p><p>While being an entertaining piece of history with useful takeaways, its
most important achievement was arguably helping create a sense of identity
for hacker culture via the revolutionary Open Source movement, and
promoting the value of the Internet for software development.</p><p>In the Cathedral-Bazaar continuum, contemporary projects like Kubernetes,
Chromium, and VSCode are <i>fusion reactors</i>.</p><p>They have the backing of heavily invested companies with virtually infinite
capital, who are able to staff highly competent teams that not only work
full-time on these projects, but also have enough personpower to maximally
leverage the benefits brought by a gigantic user base.</p><p>Like with fusion power, they seem to be able to leverage a high amount of
energy to generate even more.</p><p>Sometimes, their user base includes <i>other</i> organizations with
endless resources: by means of its success, VSCode is getting
<a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2019/11/21/fb-vs-code.aspx">sizable contributions</a> from Facebook, for example.</p><p>In contrast, the vast majority of open source projects depend almost
exclusively on decentralized volunteer efforts from people sacrificing time
out of their busy schedules and lives to move things forward.</p><p>And yet, projects following this style of development can end up becoming
backbones of modern computing:</p><blockquote><p>The OpenSSL project has been around since 1998. Since the project is open
source, it is an informal group comprised primarily of about a dozen
members throughout the world, most of whom have day jobs, and some of whom
work on a volunteer basis. Being open source, the OpenSSL project’s code
has always been public facing. Any person could download it and modify it
or implement it in their own software.</p><p>[…]</p><p>The fascinating, mind-boggling fact here is that you have this critical
piece of network infrastructure that really runs a large part of the
internet, and there’s basically one guy working on it full time.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/articles/ssl-heartbleed">Steve Marquess in “It’s Not A Fun Week To Work at OpenSSL, The Mostly
Volunteer Project Responsible for the Heartbleed Bug”, (2014)</a></p></blockquote><p>Heartbleed is a symptom of an ever-existing problem: corporations profit
massively by leveraging typically under-resourced open source projects
while not giving back proportionally, or (most commonly) at all; either
with money or people.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/xkcd_load_bearing_open_source.png" alt="Figure 2: &amp;ldquo;Load-Bearing Internet People&amp;rdquo;"><figcaption><p>Figure 2: <a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/">“Load-Bearing Internet People”</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>After Heartbleed the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Infrastructure_Initiative">Core Infrastructure Initiative</a>
was created to support software essential to the "functioning of the
Internet and other major information systems".</p><p>Less critical software like Emacs also follows this decentralized
development style, and similarly, lacks resources.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>So if Emacs wants to compete with these tools then it has to have
seamless, context aware code completion and refactoring support, and GNU
tools has to provide Emacs the necessary information to implement these
features.</p></blockquote><p>I agree. But to have that, the only way is to have motivated volunteers
step forward and work on these features. Otherwise we will never have them.</p><p>Right now, no one is working on that, though everyone is talking. [T]he
same as with weather.</p><p>— <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-10/msg00646.html">Eli Zaretskii in “Re: IDE” (2014)</a></p></blockquote><p>One way to incentivize contributions is by funding developers. Some (most?)
open source contributors would gladly take income to fund their work.</p><blockquote><p>Long-term my big dream has always been to accumulate enough backing to be
able to work full-time on open-source projects, but whether I’ll achieve
this dream or not is entirely up to you.</p><p>— <a href="https://emacsredux.com/blog/2020/09/13/patronage-revisited/">Bozhidar Batsov in “Patronage Revisited” (2020)</a></p></blockquote><p>While others feel that accepting funding would degrade their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:%5FThe%5FSurprising%5FTruth%5FAbout%5FWhat%5FMotivates%5FUs">intrinsic
motivation</a> to contribute.</p><blockquote><p>I can’t speak for all FLOSS developers, but I can speak for myself: I don’t
want monetary rewarding from users. Mainly for the reason, that I don’t
want to change the relationship with my users. Currently it is mostly a
team attitude, we’re working together to solve the problem. And there is
also no legal obligation for me to work on something I don’t like.</p><p>If I accepted contributions I think many users would get a “but I paid for
that, so do what I want” attitude. I definitely don’t want that. I do FLOSS
in my free time to do something that matters, and for my personal
fulfillment, not for money.</p><p>It will also get harder to do the right thing (in contrary to doing what
the users want) since the users can stop the payments.</p><p>So, no payments for me, thanks.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/6pjbn0/sustainable%5Femacs%5Fdevelopment%5Fsome%5Fthoughts%5Fand/">cjk101010 in “Sustainable Emacs development - some thoughts and
analysis” (2017)</a></p></blockquote><p>Which is fair: with compensation comes responsibility, timelines,
expectations, and things can get complicated. From the point of view of the
project, there doesn’t seem to be a conflict: capture funding to enable those
who need (or want) it, while still empowering those who don’t, to contribute
on their own terms.</p><p>Not everyone is in a position to spend unpaid time on open source,
especially consistently. “Free” time <a href="https://www.rightattitudes.com/2017/08/08/opportunity-cost/">isn’t free</a>—<em>it costs life</em>. By
funding work, a project might get to see contributions from talented folks
passionate about it who wouldn’t be able to volunteer their time.</p><p>And sometimes, the reason why your PR isn't getting immediate attention
is that the maintainer is busy literally
<a href="https://github.com/fre5h/DoctrineEnumBundle/pull/12#issuecomment-33023169">fighting</a>
a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_of_Dignity">revolution</a>.</p><p>For Emacs specifically, one problem is that there’s no clear way of funding
“Emacs”. Sending money to the FSF doesn’t guarantee that it will fund Emacs
development. <em>Even if there was</em> a way of “funding Emacs”, the Emacs
community—like many things in life—seems to be roughly divided in two
sides: those who prioritize <em><a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">freedom</a></em>, and those who prioritize <em>progress</em>. So
one would potentially want to fund one side or the other, depending on their
values.</p><p>In the excellent “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0578675862/">Working in Public</a>: The Making and Maintenance of Open
Source Software”, Nadia Eghbal calls attention to a shift in how
individuals support open source. Similarly to platforms like Twitch, more
and more people are funding creators directly instead of projects, as a way
of “incentivizing the ongoing creation of creative work” from developers
who produce things that are in their interests.</p><p>Maintainers of popular Emacs packages, for example, have their own <a href="https://github.com/tarsius/elisp-maintainers">separate
streams of patronage</a>, which receive varying levels of support depending on
their popularity and the value added by what they create.</p><p>For efforts that involve multiple people, like maintaining and evolving
Emacs itself, services like <a href="https://opencollective.com/">Open Collective</a> could be of great assistance by
helping on three fronts:</p><ol><li>providing a legal banking entity</li><li>recurrently collecting funds from individuals and companies</li><li>distributing funds to contributors</li></ol><p>Funds can be transparently collected, and dispersed for specific contract
work, infrastructure costs, and even developer salaries. Take for example
the <a href="https://opencollective.com/babel">Babel</a> project, which draws in enough recurrent income to finance
multiple contractors and a full-time developer earning a San Francisco
salary. An Emacs Open Collective could not only be an answer to “how can I
fund Emacs development?” but also a way to financially support developers
working on it.</p><p>The Clojure community seems to be doing an excellent job at not only
<a href="https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/q4-2020-funding-announcement/">funding</a>
efforts that are making the whole Clojure ecosystem
better but also at surveying and
<a href="https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/q3-2020-survey-results/">responding</a>
accordingly to user
feedback.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors">GitHub Sponsors</a> is another great example of developer empowerment. With it,
not only does GitHub equip people to:</p><ul><li>be more productive by providing great code hosting, bug tracking, wiki,
code reviewing and merging, project management, continuous integration,
documentation, artifact hosting, etc.</li><li>have a broader impact by giving projects more visibility and standardized
workflows that are familiar to others already on the platform</li></ul><p>It also makes it possible for its <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">40 million users</a> to frictionlessly fund
work on open source, and for a large number of maintainers to be
conveniently compensated for their labor. I just started sponsoring someone
with literally two clicks!</p><p>The power of platforms can’t be understated.</p><p>Whether you like GitHub or not, it’s undeniable that it has, and continues
to revolutionize Open Source, simply by providing a significantly better
and unified experience for all aspects of building software.</p><div><p>When there are people making over
<a href="https://changelog.com/posts/i-just-hit-100000-per-year-on-github-sponsors">100k/year</a>
on GitHub Sponsors, you better have a great reason to <b>not</b> try to
<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/neovim">take advantage</a>
of it.</p><p>In the case of Emacs, the reason is <i>freedom</i>.</p></div><p>I wouldn’t mind if Emacs development moved to GitHub, but <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/repo-criteria-evaluation.en.html">I don’t think
it’s ever going to happen</a>. Maybe for good reason: GitHub is backed by a
for-profit corporation and is far from perfect, both in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906213/github-ice-microsoft-software-email-contract-immigration-nonprofit-donation">moral</a> and <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc">technical</a>
terms. It might be a great tool today, but being a proprietary platform,
its users are at their complete mercy.</p><p>I should point out that from my perspective GitHub has been for the

      <p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> is a great resource. However, I seemed to constantly run into two issues. 1. If I didn't visit at least once a day, top items would scroll off the top pages and I would never see them. 2. If I was procrastinating and visiting the page often, I would find it difficult to determine what was new on the page. That frustration led to <b><a href="https://hckrnews.com/">hckr news</a></b>, a chronologic list of items that have made it onto the Hacker News homepage.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>With more and more content being hosted on GitHub it's a shame that you can't get notified when a particular file has changed. At least not by GitHub, that is. But you can build your own notification service. Here is how.</p> <picture> <source srcset="https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2020/12/githubwatch-notification.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2020/12/githubwatch-notification.png" alt="Adaptive card with a notification about a changed file on GitHub displayed in Microsoft Teams"> </picture> <h2>More than source control</h2> <p>GitHub is more than just the place where developers post their code. Over the last few years, it evolved also into a huge repository of content published through blogs and docs. For many, it's the go-to place to stay up-to-date on what's new.</p> <p>While GitHub offers us a way to get notified of changes to repos, the notifications options are limited. You can get notified of new releases or pull requests, but you can't get notified when a particular file has changed. With many devs using specific pages for announcing releases or keeping their changelog, being able to get notified of changes to these specific files, allows you to stay up-to-date on what's new and what's coming.</p> <h2>Build your own GitHub file changes notifier</h2> <p>To build your own GitHub file changes notifier, all you need is an <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azure subscription</a>. In the subscription, you will create a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/?WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">function app</a>, a <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/storage/?WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage account</a> and a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/?WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">logic app</a>. Here is the high-level of the solution architecture:</p> <picture> <source srcset="https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2020/12/githubwatch-diagram.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2020/12/githubwatch-diagram.png" alt="Diagram showing architecture of the solution"> </picture> <p>The storage account holds the list of files to check for changes. For each file, you will store its URL, title - for use with notifications, and a hash of its contents used to determine if the file has changed since the last time.</p> <p>The function app hosts the scheduled process that at the specified time retrieves the list of files from the storage account (1), iterates through them, for each (2) one checks if it changed and sends a notification if it did (3). If the file has changed, the function app also updates the file hash in the storage account (4).</p> <p>While there are unlimited ways to send a notification, I find using logic apps the easiest. Logic apps are extremely versatile and with just a few clicks you can set them up to receive notifications on Teams, via email, or on your phone, without having to deal with authentication, response handling, etc.</p> <h3>Set up a storage account</h3> <p>Start, by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal&amp;WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creating a storage account</a> in your resource group. In the storage account, create a table named <code>files</code>. For each file that you want to track, insert an item to the table including its <code>title</code> and <code>url</code>.</p> <picture> <source srcset="https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2020/12/githubwatch-insertentity.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2020/12/githubwatch-insertentity.png" alt="Table row showing information about a file on GitHub to monitor for changes"> </picture> <p>For each file, use the same partition key and a unique row key.</p> <h3>Create a logic app for sending notifications</h3> <p>In this example, we'll <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow?WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create a logic app</a> that sends a notification to the user on Microsoft Teams.</p> <p>In your resource group, create a logic app. Use the <strong>When a HTTP request is received</strong> trigger. As a sample payload, to generate the request schema specify:</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>

<span>const</span> <span>crypto</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>crypto</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We'll use <strong>axios</strong> to execute web requests to download files and trigger notifications. <strong>axios</strong> makes it way easier than using the raw HTTP calls from Node.js. We also need the crypto functions so that we can calculate the hash for the downloaded file contents.</p> <h4>Reference input binding</h4> <p>Extend the function's function to include the <strong>Table parameter name</strong> you copied previously. This argument will contain all files that you've added to the storage account.</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>module</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>context</span><span>,</span> <span>timer</span><span>,</span> <span>inFilesTable</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <h4>Store information about changed files</h4> <p>Next, let's define two arrays for storing information about changed files:</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// array of files that have changed</span>
<span>const</span> <span>modifiedFiles</span> <span>=</span> <span>[];</span>
<span>// array of notifications</span>
<span>const</span> <span>modifiedFilesNotifications</span> <span>=</span> <span>[];</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We need two arrays because if we've just added a file to the storage account, its hash (<code>null</code>) will not match the hash retrieved from GitHub and would result in you getting a notification that the file has changed, while it's not quite the case. Storing information about the file that changed and files for which we should issue a notification allows avoiding the unnecessary initial notification.</p> <h4>Retrieve file contents</h4> <p>Then, let's retrieve contents of all files we're tracking:</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// retrieve file contents</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><main><p>A single-threaded event loop like the one used by JavaScript and Node.js, makes it somewhat harder to have race conditions, but, SPOILER ALERT: race conditions are still possible!</p><p>In this article, we will explore the topic of race conditions in Node.js. We will discuss some examples and present a few different solutions that can help us to make our code <em>race condition free</em>.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-race-condition%3F">What is a race condition?</h2><p>First of all, let's try to clarify what a <em>race condition</em> actually is.</p><p>A race condition is a type of <em>programming error</em> that can occur when multiple processes or threads are accessing the same shared resource, for instance, a file on a file system or a record in a database, and at least one of them is trying to modify the resource.</p><p>Let's try to present an example. Imagine that while a thread is trying to rename a file, another thread is trying to delete the same file. In this case, the second thread will receive an error because, when it's trying to delete the file, the file has already been renamed. Or, the other way around, while one thread is trying to rename the file, the file was already deleted by the other thread and it's not available on the filesystem anymore.</p><p>In other cases, race conditions can be more subtle, because they wouldn't result in the program crashing, but they might just be the source of an incorrect or inconsistent behaviour. In these cases, since there is no explicit error and no stack trace, the issue is generally much harder to troubleshoot and fix.</p><p>A classic example is when 2 threads are trying to update the same data source and the new information is the result of a function applied to the current value.</p><p>Let's pretend we are building a Roman Empire simulation game in which we can manage some cash flow and we have a global balance in <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aureus"><em>aureus</em></a> (a currency used in the Roman Empire around 100 B.C.E.). Now, let's say that our initial balance is <code>0</code> <em>aurei</em> and that there are two independent game components (possibly running on separate threads) that are trying to increase the balance by <code>50</code> <em>aurei</em> each, we should expect that in the end, the balance is <code>100</code> <em>aurei</em>, right?</p><pre><code>0 + 50 + 50 = 100 ðŸ¤‘</code></pre><p>If we implement this in a naive way, we might have the two components performing three distinct operations each:</p><ol><li>Read the current value for <code>balance</code></li><li>Add <code>50</code> <em>aurei</em> to it</li><li>Save the resulting value into <code>balance</code></li></ol><p>Since the two components are running in parallel, without any synchronisation mechanism, the following case could happen:</p><span><picture><source type="image/png" srcset="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-64.png 64w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-128.png 128w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-256.png 256w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-512.png 512w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-2002.png 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-64.webp 64w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-128.webp 128w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-256.webp 256w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-512.webp 512w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-2002.webp 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="A race condition example showing 2 processes trying to update a balance" src="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-64.png" width="64" height="30"></picture></span><p>In the picture above you can see that <strong>Component 2</strong> ends up having a <em>stale</em> view of the balance: the balance gets changed by <strong>Component 1</strong> after <strong>Component 2</strong> has read the balance. For this reason, when <strong>Component 2</strong> performs its own update, it is effectively overriding any change previously made by <strong>Component 1</strong>. This is why we have a race condition: the two components are effectively racing to complete their own tasks and they might end up stepping onto each other's toes! This doesn't make <em>Julius</em> happy I am afraid...</p><p>One way to solve this problem is to isolate the 2 concurrent operations into <em>transactions</em> and make sure that there is only one transaction running at a given time. This idea might look like this:</p><span><picture><source type="image/png" srcset="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-64.png 64w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-128.png 128w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-256.png 256w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-512.png 512w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-2022.png 2022w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-64.webp 64w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-128.webp 128w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-256.webp 256w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-512.webp 512w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-2022.webp 2022w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="Fixing a race condition using a transaction" src="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-64.png" width="64" height="31"></picture></span><p>In the last picture, we are using transactions to make sure that all the steps of <strong>Component 1</strong> happen in order before all the steps of <strong>Component 2</strong>. This prevents any <em>stale read</em> and makes sure that every component always has an up to date view of the world before doing any change. You can stop holding your breath now, Julius!</p><p>In the rest of this article, we will zoom in more on race conditions in the context of Node.js and we will see some other approaches to deal with them.</p><h2 id="can-we-have-race-conditions-in-node.js%3F">Can we have race conditions in Node.js?</h2><p>It is a common misconception to think that Node.js does not have race conditions because of its single-threaded nature. While it is true that in Node.js you would not have multiple threads competing for resources, you might still end up with tasks belonging to different logical transactions being executed in an order that might result in <em>stale reads</em> and generate a race condition.</p><p>In the example that we illustrated above, we intentionally represented the various tasks (<em>read</em>, <em>increase</em> and <em>save</em>) as discrete units. Note how the system is never executing more than one task at the same time. This is a simple but accurate representation of how the Node.js event loop processes tasks on a single thread. Nonetheless, you can see that there might be situations where multiple logical transactions (e.g. multiple deposits) are scheduled concurrently on the event loop and the discrete tasks might end up being intermingled, which results in a race condition.</p><p>So... <strong>Yes</strong>, we can have race conditions in Node.js!</p><h2 id="a-node.js-example-with-a-race-condition">A Node.js example with a race condition</h2><p>Now, let's talk some code! Let's try to re-create the Roman Empire simulation game example that we discussed above.</p><p>In ancient Rome, Romans used to export olives and grapes. No wonder Italy is still famous worldwide for olive oil and wine! In our game, we want to be able to harvest olives and grapes and then sell them as a means to acquire more <em>aurei</em>.</p><p>We are going to have two functions that can increase the balance by <code>50</code> <em>aurei</em> which we are going to call <code>sellOlives()</code> and <code>sellGrapes()</code>. We will also assume that every time the balance is changed, it is persisted to a data storage of sort (e.g. a database). For the sake of this example, we won't be using a real data storage, but we will just simulate some random asynchronous delay before reading or modifying a global value. This will be enough to illustrate how we can end up with a race condition.</p><p>For starts, let's see what a buggy implementation might look like:</p><pre><code><br><br><span>const</span> <span>randomDelay</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span><span>(</span><span>resolve</span> <span>=&gt;</span><br>  <span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span>resolve<span>,</span> Math<span>.</span><span>random</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>100</span><span>)</span><br><span>)</span><p><br><br><span>let</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>0</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>loadBalance</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <br>  <span>await</span> <span>randomDelay</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  <span>return</span> balance<br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>saveBalance</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <br>  <span>await</span> <span>randomDelay</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  balance <span>=</span> value<br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>sellGrapes</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellGrapes - balance loaded: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br>  <span>const</span> newBalance <span>=</span> balance <span>+</span> <span>50</span><br>  <span>await</span> <span>saveBalance</span><span>(</span>newBalance<span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellGrapes - balance updated: </span><span><span>${</span>newBalance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>sellOlives</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellOlives - balance loaded: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br>  <span>const</span> newBalance <span>=</span> balance <span>+</span> <span>50</span><br>  <span>await</span> <span>saveBalance</span><span>(</span>newBalance<span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellOlives - balance updated: </span><span><span>${</span>newBalance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>main</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> transaction1 <span>=</span> <span>sellGrapes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>  <span>const</span> transaction2 <span>=</span> <span>sellOlives</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>  <span>await</span> transaction1 <br>                     <br>  <span>await</span> transaction2<br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Final balance: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></p></code></pre><p>If we execute this code we might end up with different results. In one case we might get the correct outcome:</p><pre><code>sellOlives - balance loaded: 0<br>sellOlives - balance updated: 50<br>sellGrapes - balance loaded: 50<br>sellGrapes - balance updated: 100<br>Final balance: 100</code></pre><p>But in other cases we might end up in a bad state:</p><pre><code>sellGrapes - balance loaded: 0<br>sellOlives - balance loaded: 0<br>sellGrapes - balance updated: 50<br>sellOlives - balance updated: 50<br>Final balance: 50</code></pre><p>Note how in this last case, <code>sellOlives</code> is essentially a stale read and therefore it will end up overriding the balance disregarding any work already done by <code>sellGrapes</code>. Yes, we do have a race condition, unfortunately!</p><p>Now, this example is simple ad it is not too hard to pinpoint exactly where the race condition has originated by just looking at the code.</p><p>Take a minute or two to read the code again. Check out the output from the 2 cases as well. Pay attention to the notes and the log messages and try to imagine how the Node.js runtime might execute this code in the 2 different scenarios.</p><p>Ok, now that you have done that, let's discuss together what happens.</p><p>In our <code>main</code> function, when we execute <code>sellGrapes()</code> and <code>sellOlives()</code>, since we are not awaiting the two operations independently, we are essentially scheduling both operations onto the event loop.</p><p>We only await the two transactions after they have been already scheduled, which means that they will work concurrently. After the two transactions have been scheduled, we wait for <code>transaction1</code> to complete and only then we wait for <code>transaction2</code> to complete. Note that <code>transaction2</code> might complete even before <code>transaction1</code>. In other words, awaiting for <code>transaction1</code> doesn't block <code>transaction2</code> in any way.</p><p>This approach is similar to writing the following code:</p><pre><code><span>await</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>sellGrapes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>sellOlives</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Using <code>Promise.all()</code> is a more commonly used way to schedule different tasks to run concurrently.</p><p>Note that with <code>Promise.all()</code>, the resulting promise will reject as soon as any of the promises rejects. In our previous example, since we await the two promises independently, we will always catch errors in <code>transaction1</code> before <code>transaction2</code>.</p><p>But let's not digress too much into this. Now that we understand the problem, how do we fix the race condition?</p><p>Well, it turns out that in this simple case, we might make things right quite easily:</p><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>main</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>await</span> <span>sellGrapes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>  <span>await</span> <span>sellOlives</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>                     <br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Final balance: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre><p>This implementation will consistently produce the following output:</p><pre><code>sellGrapes - balance loaded: 0<br>sellGrapes - balance updated: 50<br>sellOlives - balance loaded: 50<br>sellOlives - balance updated: 100<br>Final balance: 100</code></pre><p>As we can observe, <code>sellGrapes</code> is always started and completed <em>before</em> we start <code>sellOlives</code>. This makes the two logical transactions isolated and makes sure their tasks won't end up being mixed together in random order.</p><p>Problem solved... <em>vade in pacem</em> dear race condition!</p><h2 id="using-a-mutex-in-node.js">Using a mutex in Node.js</h2><p>OK, the previous example was illustrative, but if we are building a real game, chances are things will end up being a lot more complicated. We will probably end up having many different actions that might cause a change of balance. Those actions might be the result of a particular sequence of events and it might become hard to track down the discrete logical …</p></main></article></div>

  <p>I recently built a static website for a friend using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. We installed everything he needed to add content to his website on his laptop. And by all I mean just Hugo and Visual Studio Code. Then he reset his laptop and that set me thinking if we can do with even less, preferably installing nothing at all on his computer.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">GitHub Codespaces</a> came to mind. With GitHub Codespaces (currently in early access) we get a full VSCode powered development environment in the browser. Best of all it runs in an Ubuntu container giving terminal access, includes tools like Hugo out of the box and handles port forwarding for us.</p>
<p>There's something to be aware of with the automatic port forwarding and static assets such as images. So in this post I'll show how you can build and debug a static site built with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> in GitHub Codespaces.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>We'll first create an empty repository in GitHub. Make sure to add an empty README file, so we can easily open it with codespaces later on.</p>
<p><img src="https://shotor.com/blog/build-a-hugo-static-site-in-your-browser-using-github-codespaces/new-repository.png" alt="Create new repository with README"></p>
<p>Open GitHub Codespaces in the navigation bar.</p>
<p><img src="https://shotor.com/blog/build-a-hugo-static-site-in-your-browser-using-github-codespaces/codespaces.png" alt="Codespaces link in the GitHub navbar"></p>
<p>Then create a new Codespace by selecting our repository.</p>
<p><img src="https://shotor.com/blog/build-a-hugo-static-site-in-your-browser-using-github-codespaces/new-codespace.png" alt="Create new codespace by seleting a repository"></p>
<p>After a minute your VSCode environment should be ready to go.</p>
<p><img src="https://shotor.com/blog/build-a-hugo-static-site-in-your-browser-using-github-codespaces/codespace-ready.png" alt="Create new codespace by seleting a repository"></p>
<h2 id="hugo">Hugo</h2>
<p>Let's start with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. We'll run the commands of the <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Hugo quick start</a> with one modification. If you prefer to just look at the code, check out the <a href="https://github.com/shotor/hugo-codespaces-example">repository</a>.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># create a new site in the root folder, force it because it's not empty
</span><span>hugo</span><span> new site .</span><span> --force

</span><span># add ananke theme
</span><span>git</span><span> submodule add https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke

</span><span># set theme
</span><span>echo </span><span>'theme = "ananke"' </span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span> config.toml

</span><span># create new post
</span><span>hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
</span></code></pre>
<p>We'll add some content to our <code>my-first-post.md</code> file and also an image that we'll place in the <code>/static</code> folder (just drag it into the sidebar of your Codespace).</p>
<pre><code data-lang="md"><span>---
</span><span>title: 'My First Post'
date: 2021-01-24T12:00:00Z
</span><span>---

</span><span>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus in fringilla libero.

</span><span>![</span><span>Placeholder image</span><span>]</span><span>(</span><span>/image.png</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now we'll forward the port in the remote explorer tab. We know Hugo will run on 1313, so that's the port we will forward.</p>
<p><img src="https://shotor.com/blog/build-a-hugo-static-site-in-your-browser-using-github-codespaces/port-forward.png" alt="Our forwarded port"></p>
<p>Now if we just run Hugo (<code>hugo server -D</code>) our homepage will work fine. But any internal link or image will fail with a 404 error because it refers to localhost and not our GitHub url. And also there's a port included in all the links.</p>
<p>To fix this we run a modified start command where we set the <code>baseUrl</code> to the url provided by GitHub. We can get this url by right clicking on our forwarded port, and copying the url. We also need to disable the port section (in this case :1313). Our command becomes:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="sh"><span>hugo</span><span> server</span><span> -D --baseUrl</span><span>=</span><span>"https://your-github-url"</span><span> --appendPort</span><span>=</span><span>false
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now when we click on our first post, we'll see the blog post as well as the image we uploaded.</p>
<p>That's it, we now have a full development workflow completely in our browser. We can access it from anywhere to add content or make changes to the layout.</p>
<p>In this case we used Hugo, a static site generator. But this idea can be adapted to any type of webserver, for instance NodeJS or Django. As long as you bind the server to localhost and then forward the port. Making sure any internal links or images use the forwarded url as its base url.</p>
<h2 id="deployments-using-netlify">Deployments using Netlify</h2>
<p>To finish it off we'll add deployments using <a href="https://netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. We'll follow <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/">the Hugo tutorial</a> and create a <code>netlify.toml</code> file in the root directory.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="toml"><span>[</span><span>build</span><span>]
</span><span>publish </span><span>= </span><span>"public"
</span><span>command </span><span>= </span><span>"hugo --gc --minify"

</span><span>HUGO_VERSION </span><span>= </span><span>"0.80.0"

</span><span>[</span><span>context</span><span>.</span><span>split1</span><span>]

</span><span>[</span><span>context</span><span>.</span><span>split1</span><span>.</span><span>environment</span><span>]
</span><span>HUGO_VERSION </span><span>= </span><span>"0.80.0"
</span><span>HUGO_ENV </span><span>= </span><span>"production"

</span><span>[</span><span>context</span><span>.</span><span>deploy-preview</span><span>]
</span><span>command </span><span>= </span><span>"hugo --gc --minify --buildFuture -b $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL"

</span><span>[</span><span>context</span><span>.</span><span>deploy-preview</span><span>.</span><span>environment</span><span>]
</span><span>HUGO_VERSION </span><span>= </span><span>"0.80.0"

</span><span>[</span><span>context</span><span>.</span><span>branch-deploy</span><span>]
</span><span>command </span><span>= </span><span>"hugo --gc --minify -b $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL"

</span><span>[</span><span>context</span><span>.</span><span>branch-deploy</span><span>.</span><span>environment</span><span>]
</span><span>HUGO_VERSION </span><span>= </span><span>"0.80.0"

</span><span>[</span><span>context</span><span>.</span><span>next</span><span>.</span><span>environment</span><span>]
</span><span>HUGO_ENABLEGITINFO </span><span>= </span><span>"true"
</span></code></pre>
<p>Make sure we set the base url in <code>config.toml</code> to our Netlify url:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="toml"><span>baseURL </span><span>= </span><span>"https://pensive-sammet-17c943.netlify.app/"
</span><span>languageCode </span><span>= </span><span>"en-us"
</span><span>title </span><span>= </span><span>"Hugo Codespaces Example"
</span><span>theme </span><span>= </span><span>"ananke"
</span></code></pre>
<p>We can now commit and push all our changes. Which will trigger a build and deploy our static site. We can also create Pull Requests and have Netlify create preview environments for us, so we can test changes before merging them.</p>
<p>Our site is now live at <a href="https://pensive-sammet-17c943.netlify.app/">https://pensive-sammet-17c943.netlify.app/</a></p>
<p>All that's left to do is <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/">add a custom domain</a>.</p>
<h2 id="final-words">Final words</h2>
<p>Codespaces makes it really easy to work on projects hosted on GitHub.</p>
<p>There are limitations, the Ubuntu container doesn't allow you to run just any command you want, which makes sense.</p>
<p>For instance I tried to run a <a href="https://getzola.org/">Zola</a> project, but Zola requires <a href="https://snapcraft.io/">snapcraft</a>. Which is not included and cannot be installed in Codespaces. To get Zola working I had to upload the Zola binary file myself. No big deal, but on a local or a self-hosted remote vscode environment this is a non-issue.</p>
<p>Right now I'm only using it for small projects. I'm very interested to see how it holds up with bigger projects. In terms of size, as well things required from the operating system.</p>

                    <p>By Ryan Lambert -- Published January 23, 2021</p><p>Data quality is important.  This post continues exploring the
improved quality of OpenStreetMap data loaded to Postgres/PostGIS
<a href="https://github.com/rustprooflabs/pgosm-flex">via PgOSM-Flex</a>.
These improvements are enabled by the
<a href="https://osm2pgsql.org/doc/manual.html#the-flex-output">new flex output of osm2pgsql</a>,
making it easier to understand and consume OpenStreetMap data for
analytic purposes.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2020/12/osm2gpsql-flex-output-to-postgis">started exploring the Flex output</a>
a few weeks ago,
the <a href="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2021/01/postgis-openstreetmap-flex-structure">post before this one used PgOSM-Flex v0.0.3</a>.
This post uses PgOSM-Flex v0.0.7 and highlights a few cool improvements
by exploring the OSM place data.  Some of the improvements made of the past
few weeks were ideas brought over from the legacy PgOSM project.
Other improvements were spurred by questions and conversations with the
community, such as the
<a href="https://github.com/rustprooflabs/pgosm-flex/issues/37">nested admin polygons</a>.</p>
<h2>Improved places</h2>
<p>This post focuses on the <code>osm.place_polygon</code> data that stores things like
city, county and Country boundaries, along with neighborhoods and other details.
The the format of place data has a number of improvements covered in this post:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consolidated name</li>
<li>Remove duplication between relation/member polygons</li>
<li>Boundary hierarchy</li>
</ul>
<p>The data loaded for this post is the <a href="https://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/us-west.html">U.S. West sub-region</a> from
Geofabrik.  It was loaded using the <code>run-all.lua</code> and <code>run-all.sql</code> scripts
in
<a href="https://github.com/rustprooflabs/pgosm-flex">PgOSM-Flex</a>.</p>
<!--endteaser-->

<p>This post is part of the series <a href="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2018/06/pg-series-toc"><em>PostgreSQL:  From Idea to Database</em></a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Consolidated Name</h2>
<p>There are a variety of name tags used throughout various OSM features,
such as <code>name</code>, <code>alt_name</code>, <code>short_name</code>, and so on.
Since not all features are tagged equally, the name cleanup implemented in 
<a href="https://github.com/rustprooflabs/pgosm-flex/blob/main/flex-config/helpers.lua">helpers.lua</a> attemps to catch the majority of the name tags used.
The <code>get_name(tags)</code>
function is used for the <code>name</code> column in every layer throughout PgOSM-Flex,
not just the place layers.</p>
<pre><code>function get_name(tags)
    if tags.name then
        return tags.name
    elseif tags.short_name then
        return tags.short_name
    elseif tags.alt_name then
        return tags.alt_name
    elseif tags.loc_name then
        ...
</code></pre>
<p>This query shows more than 4,500 roads that end up with a value in <code>name</code>
that otherwise be missing.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM osm.road_line r
    INNER JOIN osm.tags t
        ON t.geom_type = 'W' AND r.osm_id = t.osm_id
            AND t.tags-&gt;&gt;'name' IS NULL -- The main name tag is empty
    WHERE r.name IS NOT NULL -- The road has a name
;

â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”�
â”‚ count â”‚
â•žâ•�â•�â•�â•�â•�â•�â•�â•¡
â”‚  4585 â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>The above query takes advantage of the <code>osm.tags</code> table
that stores every feature with its full set of unaltered tag data.  <code>osm.tags</code> is the largest object loaded by PgOSM-Flex, considerable size can be saved by using <code>run-no-tags.lua</code> instead of <code>run-all.lua</code>.</p>
<p>Also, of note, is the use of <code>JSONB</code> instead of <code>HSTORE</code> throughout PgOSM-Flex.  The osm2pgsql project is still defaulting to <code>HSTORE</code> for legacy reasons.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Relations and Member Polygons</h2>
<p>Many administrative boundaries have multiple parts making up their complex
shapes.
This results in the full relation polygon and multiple sub-parts being loaded
into PostGIS. This query looking for Golden, CO returns two rows instead
of the expected one.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT osm_id, osm_type, boundary, admin_level, name, member_ids
    FROM osm.place_polygon p
    WHERE p.name = 'Golden'
    ORDER BY osm_id;
</code></pre>
<p>Note the the <code>osm_id</code> in the second row is listed in the
<code>member_ids</code> column of the first row.  The negative ID value
(<code>osm_id = -112204</code>) indicates that row is
<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/112204">a relation</a>
while the other is <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/33113240">a way</a>.</p>
<pre><code>â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”�

</code></pre>
<p>The legacy osm2pgsql process did not make it easy to remove the component
geometries, at least not that I found. When using this data for
analysis, this resulted in duplication that generally required manual cleanup.</p>
<p>The <code>member_ids</code> column shown above is pulled in during osm2pgsql processing
by the <a href="https://github.com/rustprooflabs/pgosm-flex/blob/main/flex-config/place.lua">place.lua</a> style. The tables get a new column defined:</p>
<pre><code>{ column = 'member_ids', type = 'jsonb'},
</code></pre>
<p>The processing uses the <code>way_member_ids()</code> function.</p>
<pre><code>local member_ids = osm2pgsql.way_member_ids(object)
</code></pre>
<p>The associated post-processing SQL script
(<a href="https://github.com/rustprooflabs/pgosm-flex/blob/main/flex-config/place.sql">place.sql</a>) creates a view <code>osm.places_in_relations</code> that is then
used to create the materialized view <code>osm.vplace_polygon</code>.</p>
<p>Querying <code>osm.vplace_polygon</code> only returns the one relation result for Golden, CO.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT osm_id, osm_type, boundary, admin_level, name, member_ids
    FROM osm.vplace_polygon p
    WHERE p.name = 'Golden'
    ORDER BY osm_id;

<p>How big of a deal this is will vary greatly on your region's data and how

<h2>Nested places</h2>
<p>Nested places refers to administrative boundaries that are contained, or 
contain, other administrative boundaries. An example of this is the
State of Colorado contains the boundary for Jefferson County, Colorado.
Determining these hierarchical structures can be accomplished in PostGIS using 
spatial joins, using
<a href="https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Contains.html"><code>ST_Contains()</code></a>
or
<a href="https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Within.html"><code>ST_Within()</code></a>.
An example of a query using <code>ST_Within</code>() is below.</p>
<pre><code>EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, VERBOSE)
SELECT cn.*
    FROM osm.vplace_polygon st -- State  
    INNER JOIN osm.vplace_polygon cn -- County
        ON ST_Within(cn.geom, st.geom) AND cn.admin_level::INT = 6
    WHERE st.name = 'Colorado'
;
</code></pre>
<p>My laptop runs this query in 57 ms (22 ms planning + 54 ms execution).
The <code>EXPLAIN</code> <a href="https://explain.depesz.com/s/PK9V">output shows</a>
the spatial index scan is the most time consuming step, taking more than 40 ms.</p>
<pre><code>Index Scan using gix_osm_vplace_polygon ... (actual time=3.497..43.628 rows=69 loops=1)
</code></pre>

pictures are nice.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot from DBeaver showing the Colorado county polygons in blue over the Stamen Mono basemap." src="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/static/images/osm-counties-in-colorado-stamen-mono-basemap.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note:  An astute reader may notice the <code>name</code> column is not indexed, indicated by the <code>Seq Scan</code> portion of the plan.  The <code>Seq Scan</code> took 9 ms, replacing it with an index scan reduced that step (and the overall query) by only 4-5 ms.  As the next section shows, this still falls short on performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Prepare the nested data</h3>
<p>The nested data is in the table <code>osm.place_polygon_nested</code> but does not have the nesting details calculated during the main processing steps.
The columns <code>nest_level</code>, <code>name_path</code>, <code>osm_id_path</code> and <code>admin_level_path</code>
are all <code>NULL</code> to start, and the <code>row_innermost</code> and <code>innermost</code> columns are all
<code>False</code>.</p>
<p>The procedure
(<code>osm.build_nested_admin_polygons()</code>) is created but not executed by
default with the PgOSM-Flex scripts.
This process runs really fast on small regions (e.g. Colorado) but can take quite a while (&gt; 1 hour) on larger regions (Europe).
Due to the non-negligible processing time on large regions, and the fact
that not everyone will use this data, I decided to skip this in the default processing for now.</p>
<p>Log into the <code>pgosm</code> database and run the procedure:</p>
<pre><code>CALL osm.build_nested_admin_polygons();
</code></pre>
<p>This calculates the nesting of each row in small batches, default batch size 100. After each batch runs it is committed.
Once all rows have processed, the final steps calculate a boolean <code>innermost</code> 
column to easily identify boundaries
that do not contain other boundaries, e.g. the narrowest, most …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><main><p>A single-threaded event loop like the one used by JavaScript and Node.js, makes it somewhat harder to have race conditions, but, SPOILER ALERT: race conditions are still possible!</p><p>In this article, we will explore the topic of race conditions in Node.js. We will discuss some examples and present a few different solutions that can help us to make our code <em>race condition free</em>.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-race-condition%3F">What is a race condition?</h2><p>First of all, let's try to clarify what a <em>race condition</em> actually is.</p><p>A race condition is a type of <em>programming error</em> that can occur when multiple processes or threads are accessing the same shared resource, for instance, a file on a file system or a record in a database, and at least one of them is trying to modify the resource.</p><p>Let's try to present an example. Imagine that while a thread is trying to rename a file, another thread is trying to delete the same file. In this case, the second thread will receive an error because, when it's trying to delete the file, the file has already been renamed. Or, the other way around, while one thread is trying to rename the file, the file was already deleted by the other thread and it's not available on the filesystem anymore.</p><p>In other cases, race conditions can be more subtle, because they wouldn't result in the program crashing, but they might just be the source of an incorrect or inconsistent behaviour. In these cases, since there is no explicit error and no stack trace, the issue is generally much harder to troubleshoot and fix.</p><p>A classic example is when 2 threads are trying to update the same data source and the new information is the result of a function applied to the current value.</p><p>Let's pretend we are building a Roman Empire simulation game in which we can manage some cash flow and we have a global balance in <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aureus"><em>aureus</em></a> (a currency used in the Roman Empire around 100 B.C.E.). Now, let's say that our initial balance is <code>0</code> <em>aurei</em> and that there are two independent game components (possibly running on separate threads) that are trying to increase the balance by <code>50</code> <em>aurei</em> each, we should expect that in the end, the balance is <code>100</code> <em>aurei</em>, right?</p><pre><code>0 + 50 + 50 = 100 ðŸ¤‘</code></pre><p>If we implement this in a naive way, we might have the two components performing three distinct operations each:</p><ol><li>Read the current value for <code>balance</code></li><li>Add <code>50</code> <em>aurei</em> to it</li><li>Save the resulting value into <code>balance</code></li></ol><p>Since the two components are running in parallel, without any synchronisation mechanism, the following case could happen:</p><span><picture><source type="image/png" srcset="https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-64.png 64w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-128.png 128w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-256.png 256w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-512.png 512w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-2002.png 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-64.webp 64w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-128.webp 128w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-256.webp 256w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-512.webp 512w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-2002.webp 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="A race condition example showing 2 processes trying to update a balance" src="https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-64.png" width="64" height="30"></picture></span><p>In the picture above you can see that <strong>Component 2</strong> ends up having a <em>stale</em> view of the balance: the balance gets changed by <strong>Component 1</strong> after <strong>Component 2</strong> has read the balance. For this reason, when <strong>Component 2</strong> performs its own update, it is effectively overriding any change previously made by <strong>Component 1</strong>. This is why we have a race condition: the two components are effectively racing to complete their own tasks and they might end up stepping onto each other's toes! This doesn't make <em>Julius</em> happy I am afraid...</p><p>One way to solve this problem is to isolate the 2 concurrent operations into <em>transactions</em> and make sure that there is only one transaction running at a given time. This idea might look like this:</p><span><picture><source type="image/png" srcset="https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-64.png 64w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-128.png 128w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-256.png 256w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-512.png 512w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-2022.png 2022w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-64.webp 64w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-128.webp 128w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-256.webp 256w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-512.webp 512w, https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-2022.webp 2022w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="Fixing a race condition using a transaction" src="https://nodejsdp.link/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-64.png" width="64" height="31"></picture></span><p>In the last picture, we are using transactions to make sure that all the steps of <strong>Component 1</strong> happen in order before all the steps of <strong>Component 2</strong>. This prevents any <em>stale read</em> and makes sure that every component always has an up to date view of the world before doing any change. You can stop holding your breath now, Julius!</p><p>In the rest of this article, we will zoom in more on race conditions in the context of Node.js and we will see some other approaches to deal with them.</p><h2 id="can-we-have-race-conditions-in-node.js%3F">Can we have race conditions in Node.js?</h2><p>It is a common misconception to think that Node.js does not have race conditions because of its single-threaded nature. While it is true that in Node.js you would not have multiple threads competing for resources, you might still end up with tasks belonging to different logical transactions being executed in an order that might result in <em>stale reads</em> and generate a race condition.</p><p>In the example that we illustrated above, we intentionally represented the various tasks (<em>read</em>, <em>increase</em> and <em>save</em>) as discrete units. Note how the system is never executing more than one task at the same time. This is a simple but accurate representation of how the Node.js event loop processes tasks on a single thread. Nonetheless, you can see that there might be situations where multiple logical transactions (e.g. multiple deposits) are scheduled concurrently on the event loop and the discrete tasks might end up being intermingled, which results in a race condition.</p><p>So... <strong>Yes</strong>, we can have race conditions in Node.js!</p><h2 id="a-node.js-example-with-a-race-condition">A Node.js example with a race condition</h2><p>Now, let's talk some code! Let's try to re-create the Roman Empire simulation game example that we discussed above.</p><p>In ancient Rome, Romans used to export olives and grapes. No wonder Italy is still famous worldwide for olive oil and wine! In our game, we want to be able to harvest olives and grapes and then sell them as a means to acquire more <em>aurei</em>.</p><p>We are going to have two functions that can increase the balance by <code>50</code> <em>aurei</em> which we are going to call <code>sellOlives()</code> and <code>sellGrapes()</code>. We will also assume that every time the balance is changed, it is persisted to a data storage of sort (e.g. a database). For the sake of this example, we won't be using a real data storage, but we will just simulate some random asynchronous delay before reading or modifying a global value. This will be enough to illustrate how we can end up with a race condition.</p><p>For starts, let's see what a buggy implementation might look like:</p><pre><code><br><br><span>const</span> <span>randomDelay</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span><span>(</span><span>resolve</span> <span>=&gt;</span><br>  <span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span>resolve<span>,</span> Math<span>.</span><span>random</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>100</span><span>)</span><br><span>)</span><p><br><br><span>let</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>0</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>loadBalance</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <br>  <span>await</span> <span>randomDelay</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  <span>return</span> balance<br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>saveBalance</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <br>  <span>await</span> <span>randomDelay</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  balance <span>=</span> value<br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>sellGrapes</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellGrapes - balance loaded: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br>  <span>const</span> newBalance <span>=</span> balance <span>+</span> <span>50</span><br>  <span>await</span> <span>saveBalance</span><span>(</span>newBalance<span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellGrapes - balance updated: </span><span><span>${</span>newBalance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>sellOlives</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellOlives - balance loaded: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br>  <span>const</span> newBalance <span>=</span> balance <span>+</span> <span>50</span><br>  <span>await</span> <span>saveBalance</span><span>(</span>newBalance<span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellOlives - balance updated: </span><span><span>${</span>newBalance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>main</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> transaction1 <span>=</span> <span>sellGrapes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>  <span>const</span> transaction2 <span>=</span> <span>sellOlives</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>  <span>await</span> transaction1 <br>                     <br>  <span>await</span> transaction2<br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Final balance: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></p></code></pre><p>If we execute this code we might end up with different results. In one case we might get the correct outcome:</p><pre><code>sellOlives - balance loaded: 0<br>sellOlives - balance updated: 50<br>sellGrapes - balance loaded: 50<br>sellGrapes - balance updated: 100<br>Final balance: 100</code></pre><p>But in other cases we might end up in a bad state:</p><pre><code>sellGrapes - balance loaded: 0<br>sellOlives - balance loaded: 0<br>sellGrapes - balance updated: 50<br>sellOlives - balance updated: 50<br>Final balance: 50</code></pre><p>Note how in this last case, <code>sellOlives</code> is essentially a stale read and therefore it will end up overriding the balance disregarding any work already done by <code>sellGrapes</code>. Yes, we do have a race condition, unfortunately!</p><p>Now, this example is simple ad it is not too hard to pinpoint exactly where the race condition has originated by just looking at the code.</p><p>Take a minute or two to read the code again. Check out the output from the 2 cases as well. Pay attention to the notes and the log messages and try to imagine how the Node.js runtime might execute this code in the 2 different scenarios.</p><p>Ok, now that you have done that, let's discuss together what happens.</p><p>In our <code>main</code> function, when we execute <code>sellGrapes()</code> and <code>sellOlives()</code>, since we are not awaiting the two operations independently, we are essentially scheduling both operations onto the event loop.</p><p>We only await the two transactions after they have been already scheduled, which means that they will work concurrently. After the two transactions have been scheduled, we wait for <code>transaction1</code> to complete and only then we wait for <code>transaction2</code> to complete. Note that <code>transaction2</code> might complete even before <code>transaction1</code>. In other words, awaiting for <code>transaction1</code> doesn't block <code>transaction2</code> in any way.</p><p>This approach is similar to writing the following code:</p><pre><code><span>await</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>sellGrapes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>sellOlives</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Using <code>Promise.all()</code> is a more commonly used way to schedule different tasks to run concurrently.</p><p>Note that with <code>Promise.all()</code>, the resulting promise will reject as soon as any of the promises rejects. In our previous example, since we await the two promises independently, we will always catch errors in <code>transaction1</code> before <code>transaction2</code>.</p><p>But let's not digress too much into this. Now that we understand the problem, how do we fix the race condition?</p><p>Well, it turns out that in this simple case, we might make things right quite easily:</p><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>main</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>await</span> <span>sellGrapes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>  <span>await</span> <span>sellOlives</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>                     <br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Final balance: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre><p>This implementation will consistently produce the following output:</p><pre><code>sellGrapes - balance loaded: 0<br>sellGrapes - balance updated: 50<br>sellOlives - balance loaded: 50<br>sellOlives - balance updated: 100<br>Final balance: 100</code></pre><p>As we can observe, <code>sellGrapes</code> is always started and completed <em>before</em> we start <code>sellOlives</code>. This makes the two logical transactions isolated and makes sure their tasks won't end up being mixed together in random order.</p><p>Problem solved... <em>vade in pacem</em> dear race condition!</p><h2 id="using-a-mutex-in-node.js">Using a mutex in Node.js</h2><p>OK, the previous example was illustrative, but if we are building a real game, chances are things will end up being a lot more complicated. We will probably end up having many different actions that might cause a change of balance. Those actions might be the result of a particular sequence of events and it might become hard to track down the discrete logical …</p></main></article></div>

<p>After a decade of fierce rivalry with China's technology giant Huawei, Europe's telecoms equipment champions Nokia and Ericsson could soon face myriad new competitors to contend with.</p>



<p>As Europe cuts back on using Huawei equipment in its 5G networks, mobile operators are looking far and wide for companies to replace it. The Continent's "big four" telcos Deutsche Telekom, Telefónica, Vodafone and Orange on Wednesday <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1578702">published</a> a joint "<a href="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20/POLITICO-Memorandum-of-Understanding-OPEN-RAN-big-four-operators-January-2021.pdf">memorandum of understanding</a>" pledging to prioritize the development of "Open RAN" technology, a concept that would benefit smaller equipment and software makers.</p>



<p>Open RAN encompasses the idea of chopping up the 5G supply chain into smaller pieces and imposing standards on equipment and software firms so their products can work together — a "Lego approach," as one expert called it, to digital infrastructure. It would allow operators to procure specialized kit and services in smaller contracts with different players to piece together a 5G network, breaking the market power of “end-to-end” vendors like Ericsson and Nokia.</p>



<p>The operators' public campaign in favor of the standards comes after years of lobbying against 5G security laws that will significantly decrease Huawei's market presence in Europe in coming years. The operators, now barred by governments from using Huawei in several European markets, see Open RAN as a fix to what they consider a duopoly in the vendor market that allows Ericsson and Nokia to charge higher prices for 5G equipment.</p>



<p>Once in place, Open RAN could help equipment makers like South Korea’s Samsung and Japan’s NEC, cloud providers and tech giants like Amazon, Google and Microsoft as well as smaller, specialized software companies like Altiostar and Mavenir gain a stronger foothold in Europe’s growing 5G market.</p>



<p>The big four operators said they'd also "promote to European policymakers and industry that adopting a competitive Open RAN ecosystem will place Europe and European industry at the front in the race of technological leadership."</p>



<p>But for the two European leading vendors, Ericsson and Nokia, the political push to boost new competitors could put more strain on already-narrow profit margins and troubled financials.</p>



<h3>Geopolitics of standards</h3>



<p>Operators across the world in 2018 started working on new standards in an association called the <a href="https://www.o-ran.org/about" target="_blank">O-RAN Alliance</a>. It's a standard-setting body that includes participants from more than 200 companies across the tech sector, including Microsoft, Facebook, chipmakers, software firms and Europe's leading vendors Ericsson and Nokia.</p>



<p>The O-RAN Alliance includes Chinese operators but not its tech giant Huawei — which is telling. </p>



<p>The Chinese giant has always perceived Open RAN as a challenge to its dominance: "O-RAN is currently hijacked for geo-political reasons. It's been weaponized, specifically against Huawei," a company official said in a conversation in June, requesting not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.</p>



<p>The push for Open RAN standards quickly gained pace in the U.S., where lawmakers realized the country's technology industry had missed the boat on developing 5G equipment.</p>



<p>U.S. Congress in November <a href="https://www.rcrwireless.com/20201118/policy/house-unanimously-passes-750-million-open-ran-5g-bill" target="_blank">passed a bill</a> approving $750 million in public funding to develop Open RAN technologies.   </p>



<p>The U.S. tech industry has also been leaning on European capitals through a lobby group called the <a href="https://www.openranpolicy.org/about-us/members/" target="_blank">Open RAN Policy Coalition</a>, formed in May last year. It gathers smaller U.S. software firms like Altiostar and Mavenir with household names like Cisco and Juniper and tech giants Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Intel and others. Non-U.S. names include Samsung, NEC, Fujitsu, Rakuten, as well as Europe's three largest telecoms operators and Nokia.</p>



<p>"One thing we've heard from European governments ... is that a diverse ecosystem is very important and they want to see that European vendors have a share of the market," said Alex Botting, senior director at Venable, a lobby firm that represents the coalition in talks with European authorities. </p>



<p>In London, the initiative got backing from the government when it <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1532681">presented</a> its "diversification strategy" in November. It pledged £250 million in funding to boost innovation in Open RAN and try to introduce new, smaller 5G equipment makers. It also pledged to fund a new trial with Japanese telecoms vendor NEC.</p>



<h3>Europe's gain, Europe's loss</h3>



<p>For European lawmakers, the question is which specific European companies would gain from Open RAN — besides the operators that expect it to bring down procurement prices.</p>



<p>The concept comes with risks to its own leaders in the field, Ericsson and Nokia, who increasingly have free range in markets that have blocked or are shunning Chinese vendors. </p>



<p>"If you break that duopoly and you have lots of new suppliers, what does that do to the two European incumbents?" said Alex Sinclair, chief technology officer at global telecoms operators association GSMA.</p>



<p>Nokia has arguably been more receptive to the idea of Open RAN, but Ericsson has been lukewarm. </p>



<p>Its Chief Technology Officer Erik Ekudden said <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1431389">in an interview in July</a> that the technology was still&nbsp;“maturing.” He said the telecoms network market was already open for competitors to try and enter, but few had succeeded because it's a tough market. “We have a consolidated market, we have relatively few radio access network vendors … But it’s still an extremely competitive market,” Ekudden said.  </p>



<p>Lawmakers in Europe have still sought to diversify telecoms vendors as part of the EU's "<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_123" target="_blank">5G security toolbox</a>" process that aimed to decrease the dependency on Huawei. </p>



<p>Regulators, lawmakers and industry officials are exploring policy options to soften the blow of phasing out Huawei, in working groups within the EU's digital services department as well as in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/nis-cooperation-group" target="_blank">NIS Cooperation Group</a>, a roundtable of cybersecurity experts of EU countries and the Commission.</p>



<p>In Berlin, the government also expressed support for Open RAN in recent updates of telecoms security rules, and operators have launched <a href="https://uk.nec.com/en_GB/press/202012/global_20201216_01.html" target="_blank">pilot projects</a> with new vendors already. </p>



<h3>Technical challenges ahead</h3>



<p>Above all, the operators' document Wednesday is a signal to both the industry's supply chain and the regulators overseeing it that they take Open RAN seriously.</p>



<p>In the document, they pledged to work together on Open RAN standards, invest in developing the technology and push governments and regulators to contribute research funding and “policy support.”</p>



<p>The four telcos, together with U.S. and Chinese counterparts like AT&amp;T, Verizon, China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom and others, buy the most network equipment. A choice for a certain technology is certain to spur research by suppliers in coming years, and that could speed up the process to get large Open RAN networks up and running. </p>



<p>"Left to its natural course, this would probably take many years to become significant," said GSMA's Sinclair, adding that operators' public support "is all about accelerating this."</p>



<p>But running a network of smaller building blocks also increases technical headaches, he said: "If you're dealing with smaller suppliers, you have quite a lot of procurement problems," adding Open RAN networks would need a "system integrator" company to manage all the different parts — a role that operators in past decades have sourced out to vendors like Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia.</p>

            Sun Jan 24 2021
          
          </p><p>The year is 2021.
The world has been transformed into a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
COVID-19 has been cured,
but one of the vaccines went horribly awry:
some of the people who got the Oxford-Zeneca vaccine started
frothing at the mouth,
indiscriminately biting people,
and chanting <em>"Volker Halbach, Volker Halbach"</em>
before succumbing to their lack of qualia.</p>
<p>Two back-to-back pandemics were too much for the world to handle,
and the remnants of humanity have been reduced to
scavenging for GrabFood discounts.</p>
<p>But there is hope. A new screening test has been devised:
a perfect test that can detect for sure
whether someone has the virus in a matter of seconds...</p>
<hr>
<p>You are an overworked civil servant at the Ministry of Health.
Your boss comes in one day
brandishing a couple of important-looking documents.</p>
<p>"New directive from the Minister---we need
to test every traveler that comes in to the country.
Can you write me a proposal by today?"</p>
<p>What choice do you have? You get to work.</p>
<h2 id="0.-the-basic-one">0. The basic one</h2>
<p>The proposal goes something like this:
All visitors to the country will line up at a testing booth.
When it's their turn they'll spit in a cup
and then their secretion will be tested for the virus.
If they test negative, they're free to go;
if they test positive, they're whisked away
to a quarantine facility <s>never to be seen again</s>.
You bang it all out and send it to your boss.</p>
<p><img src="https://lieuzhenghong.com/img/group_testing/queue.png" alt="How to test travelers"></p>
<p>You get a call the next day.
Your boss is aghast.</p>
<p>"We haven't got nearly enough tests
to test everyone who comes!" he shouts.</p>
<p>"Can we order more tests?" you ask.</p>
<p>"No, the whole world is out of tests."</p>
<p>You take a deep breath to calm yourself.</p>
<p>"The Minister wants us to test everybody that comes in, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"But we don't have enough tests to test everybody?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>A few choice words come to mind, but you (wisely) stay silent.</p>
<p>If your boss had any shame he'd have the courtesy
to at least <em>look</em> sheepish,
but unfortunately all senior civil servants have had that
part of the brain surgically excised.
In any case, he wants you to come up with a new proposal.
"Can you find some way to test everyone, but with fewer tests?
As few as possible?"
You try to say something noncommittal but he's already hung up.</p>
<hr>
<p>Clumps of your hair lie morosely on the table.</p>
<p>Testing everyone without enough tests for everyone?
How is that possible?</p>
<p>You review the evidence.
Preliminary findings suggest that
out of every 1000 people,
roughly 3 people will have the virus.
Also, the test is perfectly accurate and infinitely-sensitive,
which means that it always gives the right answer,
and we can test as many people as we want with one test.
(Since the test is infinitely-sensitive, you can test the tiniest
drop of a person's spit, and it will give you the right answer).</p>
<p>Then you have a flash of insight:</p>

<p>Let's make one small change to the protocol.
Visitors will have to queue-up-and-spit---just as before---but
now TWO visitors will spit in one cup.
This combined cup will then be sent for testing.
Because the test is infinitely sensitive, it will test
positive if either (or both) of the visitors have the virus.
If the combined test comes back negative, then neither visitor
has the virus, and they are free to go.
If it comes back positive, then at least one of the pair has the virus.
We then test each of them individually.</p>
<p>This two-visitors-one-cup protocol will save almost half
of the tests because most of the tests will come out negative.
Why is this so?
The key here is that <strong>most travelers don't have the virus.</strong></p>
<p>Let's use an example to illustrate.</p>
<p>Suppose we have 1,000 travelers and 3 of them have the virus. <sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>
If you test them individually then you will use up 1,000 tests.
If you pair them up at random, however, one of the following
must be the case:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are three pairs with one positive person,
and 497 all-negative pairs.</li>
<li>There is one pair with two positive people,
one pair of one pair with one positive person,
and 498 all-negative pairs.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the first case,
we will use 500 tests for each of the pairs.
Three of those tests will come out positive and we will use
an additional two tests for each of them.
The total number of tests is
<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>500</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>∗</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>506</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">500 + 3*2 = 506</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>In the second,
we will again use 500 tests for each of the pairs,
and use two additional tests for each of the two positive pairs,
for a total of
<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>500</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>∗</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>504</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">500 + 2*2 = 504</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>In either case, we've cut the number of tests needed by almost half!
This method only works because most travelers are negative,
and so most pairs will test negative.
By contrast, if the infection rate was much higher
and 800 out of every 1000 people had the virus then
almost all of the pairs would test positive
and you would do better just testing everyone individually.</p>

<p>If two is good, surely three is better, four even better,
and ten double-plus-good better?
We'll divide travelers into groups---of, say, ten---
and get them all to spit into the cup.
Doing so could save us even more
tests if most visitors don't have the virus.
Assuming we only have three visitors with the virus
out of our 1000 visitors,
there can be at most three positive groups <em>no matter the group size.</em>
Doing groups of 10 would mean at most thirty individual tests,
for an upper bound of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>100</mn><mo>+</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>∗</mo><mn>10</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>130</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">100 + (3*10) = 130</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> tests.</p>
<p>But of course, there's an upper bound to how many people you can
put in a group.
If you get all 1,000 people to spit into the same bucket (yucks) and test <em>that</em>
you'll only have to do one combined test,
but that test is definitely going to come out positive
and you're going to have to test all 1,000 people individually.
Then you haven't saved any tests at all.</p>
<p>We can calculate the optimal size for each group.
The trade-off of having bigger groups
is that you do fewer group tests that combine multiple people,
but have to do more individual tests when a combined test comes back positive.
Let's introduce some notation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of total people = <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></li>
<li>Number of infected = <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>K</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></li>
<li>Number of groups = <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">G</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></li>
<li>Number of people in each partition = <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mi>G</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N/G = p</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>In the worst case you have to do <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi><mo>+</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>∗</mo><mi>min</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>K</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>G</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">G + (p * \min(K, G))</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> tests.</p>
<p>Why is this so?
In the first step you need to test the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">G</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> groups.
And in the worst case, all <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>K</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> of the groups will come out positive
(ergo each positive group has exactly one positive person),
and you'll have to test each of those <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>K</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> groups individually
which takes <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> tests each.</p>
<p>We can prove by differentiation
that the optimal number of people in each partition,
<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>p</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em">∗</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p^{*}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, is given by <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>p</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em">∗</mo></msup><mo>=</mo><msqrt><mfrac><mi>N</mi><mi>k</mi></mfrac></msqrt></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p^{*} = \sqrt{\frac{N}{k}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>Using our example of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1000</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N=1000</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>K</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K=3</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>,
this would mean that the optimal group size is <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msqrt><mn>333</mn></msqrt></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sqrt{333}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>
which is something like 18.5. <sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> If we use <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>20</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p = 20</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> instead
(just so the numbers are easier to work with)
you would need <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>50</mn><mo>+</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>∗</mo><mn>20</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>110</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">50 + (3*20) = 110</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> tests at most
in the worst case, where you do 50 combined tests,
then test the 3 positive groups of 20 individually.</p>
<p>That's quite a big reduction.
By grouping people together into larger groups and testing those groups
we can decrease the number of tests needed by almost 90%,
from 1,000 to around 100.</p>
<p>You sketch out a diagram of how this larger group test approach works
and email it to your boss.
He makes a couple of quick scribbles on it
and it's quickly distributed to Border Control:</p>
<p><img src="https://lieuzhenghong.com/img/group_testing/group_test_base_2.png" alt="Handout to ministry workers"></p>
<p>For a while, all is well.
You've done the impossible with your great leap of insight
and your boss gives you an A in your performance appraisal.
Your meteoric rise through the ranks of the Civil Service
is all but assured, you think to yourself -- but alas,
Fate is never so kind...</p>
<hr>
<p>A few months later, you enter the office and find it in a
state of upheaval.</p>
<p>It is pandemonium.
Your colleagues are screaming, jumping on desks,
and smashing file cabinets:
files and papers litter the floor,
and your Director is bawling his eyes out.</p>
<p>"What happened here?" you ask,
and in between racking sobs he points to a
stack of papers on his desk:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As part of the Digital Government Blueprint
and the continuing economic difficulties
caused by the post-pandemic pandemic,
we call upon the Whole-of-Government
to embark upon a Productivity Improvement and Digitisation Journey
to increase WoG efficiency and reduce government expenditure...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lesser men would have gotten hopelessly lost
in the thick thicket of Bureaucrat-ease,
but you realise the subtext immediately.
In order for your boss to keep his year-end bonus
all his charges must demonstrate a 25% efficiency increase
---which means <em>you</em> have to reduce the number of tests by 25%.</p>
<p>(At this point the reader might wonder if a fairly mundane requirement
of a efficiency increase could lead to such an exaggerated scene.
I congratulate such a reader for his good fortune not to have worked
in the Civil Service).</p>
<p>You steal a furtive glance at your boss.
He seems to have recovered very quickly
and is now eyeing you expectantly.
You try to tell him that you've <em>already</em> saved him 90% of tests
but he's having none of it.
He quickly shoos you out of his office,
leaving you once again to do the seemingly impossible...</p>
<hr>

<p>Your most recent proposal is to test groups of 20.
If any group's test comes back positive,
test every single person in that group.
But must we test everyone individually once a group tests positive?
Can't we group people together again into subgroups of, say, 5?
And if that subgroup tests positive, can't we group people together <em>again</em>?
And so on.
After all, if we were able to save tests by
splitting our original group of 1000 into sub-groups,
maybe we can save even more tests by
splitting our sub-groups into sub-subgroups etc.</p>
<p>Here's an example. We have a group of 20 that tested positive.
We might then choose subgroups of 5 from that 20,
and start testing the first subgroup of 5.
If <em>that</em> subgroup tests positive we then split them
<em>again</em> into sub-subgroups of 2 and 3, and if those sub-subgroups
test positive we test them individually.
As before, if any group/subgroup/subsubgroup... tests negative
then we simply move on to the next one.</p>
<p><img src="https://lieuzhenghong.com/img/group_testing/breadth_first_search_2.png" alt="Breadth-first search"></p>
<p>Does this actually save us tests?
Let's think about how many tests we would use in the worst case.
The worst case is when the positive tests are as
"spread out" …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/apple">Apple</a> issued further warning stating that the additional magnets in <a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/iphone12">iPhone 12</a>, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max, also, <a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/magsafe">MagSafe</a> accessories pose a risk to people with pacemakers and defibrillators.</p>
<p>Apple had previously accepted that the tendency for the magnets to interfere with some implanted medical equipment, however, the company, now, has going further to explain the risk attached, then offering advice. Apple advised that distancing is of importance, most especially while charging wirelessly.</p>
<p>Not too long ago in October 2020 — coinciding with the release of its new phones — Apple made mention that there’s a risk of electromagnetic interference with some medical devices. The company, now, has finally updated the earlier issued support document which warned of the risks to give further advice.</p>

<p>Apple has, particularly, now provided more information on how far to distant iPhone and MagSafe accessories from sensitive medical devices.</p>

<p>This updated advice came after a report which was published in the Heart Rhythm Journal had warned of the danger from latest generation iPhone 12 “which can potentially subdue lifesaving therapy in a patient especially while placing the phone in upper pockets” .</p>
<p>Please find full text of the support document below:</p>
<p><strong>“About the magnets inside iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max, and MagSafe accessories</strong></p>
<p><em>iPhone contains magnets as well as components and radios that emit electromagnetic fields. All MagSafe accessories (each sold separately) also contain magnets — and MagSafe Charger and MagSafe Duo Charger contain radios. These magnets and electromagnetic fields might interfere with medical devices.</em></p>
<p><em>Though all iPhone 12 models contain more magnets than prior iPhone models, they’re not expected to pose a greater risk of magnetic interference to medical devices than prior iPhone models.</em></p>
<p><em>Medical devices such as implanted pacemakers and defibrillators might contain sensors that respond to magnets and radios when in close contact. To avoid any potential interactions with these devices, keep your iPhone and MagSafe accessories a safe distance away from your device (more than 6 inches / 15 cm apart or more than 12 inches / 30 cm apart if wirelessly charging). But consult with your physician and your device manufacturer for specific guidelines.</em></p>
<p><em>Consult your physician and medical device manufacturer for information specific to your medical device and whether you need to maintain a safe distance of separation between your medical device and iPhone or any MagSafe accessories. Manufacturers often provide recommendations on the safe use of their devices around wireless or magnetic products to prevent possible interference. If you suspect iPhone or any MagSafe accessories are interfering with your medical device, stop using your iPhone or MagSafe accessories.</em></p>
<p><em>We provide more information on safety at <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ng/guide/iphone/iph301fc905/ios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Important safety information</a> for iPhone in the iPhone User Guide.</em>”</p>

<p>Be safe…</p>

      <p>Send a simple email</p> 
      <p>Ogham provides a single entry point (<code>MessagingService</code>) to send any message. To send an email, just prepare the email content using the <code>Email</code> class. The fluent API lets you chain API calls and also helps to guide developers.</p> 
      <p>In standalone mode (without framework integration), <code>MessagingService</code> has to be instantiated. In this sample, the predefined behavior is used. The properties are used to configure the SMTP protocol/implementation.</p>

      <p>Send using a template</p> 
      <p>In real world applications, messages content need to be constructed with variable parts. That’s why Ogham provides integration with several templating engines.</p> 
      <p>The only difference here is the use of <code>TemplateContent</code> instead of a string. This indicates to Ogham that the content is a template to evaluate.</p> 
      <p>The template is located in the classpath (use of <code>classpath:</code>). The template contains variables (<code>name</code> and <code>value</code>). To evaluate the template, a model is needed to provide values for <code>name</code> and <code>value</code>. In the example, the class <code>SimpleBean</code> is defined with the properties and used as model.</p> 
      <p>Templates can be used for SMS or whatever in the same way.</p> 
      <p>In the sample, Thymeleaf template engine is used but it could be any template engine.</p>

<p>
The field of graph representation learning has grown at an incredible (and sometimes unwieldy) pace over the past seven years, transforming from a small subset of researchers working on a relatively niche topic to one of the fastest growing sub-areas of deep learning.
</p>
<p>
This book is my attempt to provide a brief but comprehensive introduction to graph representation learning, including methods for embedding graph data, graph neural networks, and deep generative models of graphs.

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>2020 was an intense year. I hope you're healthy and keep being healthy. I am privileged (as lots of software engineers and academics are) to be able to work from home during the pandemic. Let's not forget people in less privileged situations,  and let’s try to give them as much practical, psychological and financial support as we can these days. And as much joy as possible to everyone around :)</p>
<p>I cancelled the autumn MirageOS retreat due to the pandemic. Instead I collected donations for our hosts in Marrakech - they were very happy to receive our financial support, since they had a difficult year, since their income is based on tourism. I hope that in autumn 2021 we'll have an on-site retreat again.</p>
<p>For 2021, we (at <a href="https://robur.coop/">robur</a>) got a grant from the EU (via <a href="https://pointer.ngi.eu/">NGI pointer</a>) for "Deploying MirageOS" (more details below), and another grant from <a href="https://ocaml-sf.org/">OCaml software foundation</a> for securing the opam supply chain (using <a href="https://github.com/hannesm/conex">conex</a>). Some long-awaited releases for MirageOS libraries, namely a <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-first-release-of-awa-ssh">ssh implementation</a> and a rewrite of our <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-release-of-ocaml-git-v3-0-duff-encore-decompress-etc/">git implementation</a> have already been published.</p>
<p>With my MirageOS view, 2020 was a pretty successful year, where we managed to add more features, fixed lots of bugs, and paved the road ahead. I want to thank <a href="https://ocamllabs.io/">OCamlLabs</a> for funding work on MirageOS maintenance.</p>
<h2 id="Recap-2020">Recap 2020</h2>

<p>Here is a very subjective random collection of accomplishments in 2020, where I was involved with some degree.</p>
<h3 id="NetHSM">NetHSM</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.nitrokey.com/products/nethsm">NetHSM</a> is a hardware security module in software. It is a product that uses MirageOS for security, and is based on the <a href="https://muen.sk/">muen</a> separation kernel. We at <a href="https://robur.coop/">robur</a> were heavily involved in this product. It already has been security audited by an external team. You can pre-order it from Nitrokey.</p>
<h3 id="TLS-1-3">TLS 1.3</h3>

<p>Dating back to 2016, at the <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2016/tron-workshop-programme/">TRON</a> (TLS 1.3 Ready or NOt), we developed a first draft of a 1.3 implementation of <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls">OCaml-TLS</a>. Finally in May 2020 we got our act together, including ECC (ECDH P256 from <a href="https://github.com/mit-plv/fiat-crypto/">fiat</a>, X25519 from <a href="https://project-everest.github.io/">hacl</a>) and testing with <a href="https://github.com/tlsfuzzer/tlsfuzzer">tlsfuzzer</a>, and release tls 0.12.0 with TLS 1.3 support. Later we added <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls/pull/414">ECC ciphersuites to TLS version 1.2</a>, implemented <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls/pull/414">ChaCha20/Poly1305</a>, and fixed an <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls/pull/424">interoperability issue with Go's implementation</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto">Mirage-crypto</a> provides the underlying cryptographic primitives, initially released in March 2020 as a fork of <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-nocrypto">nocrypto</a> -- huge thanks to <a href="https://github.com/pqwy">pqwy</a> for his great work. Mirage-crypto detects <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/53">CPU features at runtime</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Julow">Julow</a>) (<a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/96">bugfix for bswap</a>), using constant time modular exponentation (powm_sec) and hardens against Lenstra's CRT attack, supports <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/39">compilation on Windows</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/avsm">avsm</a>), <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/90">async entropy harvesting</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/seliopou">seliopou</a>), <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/65">32 bit support</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/72">chacha20/poly1305</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/abeaumont">abeaumont</a>), <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/84">cross-compilation</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/EduardoRFS">EduardoRFS</a>) and <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/78">various</a> <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/81">bug</a> <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/83">fixes</a>, even <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/95">memory leak</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/talex5">talex5</a> for reporting several of these issues), and <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/99">RSA</a> <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/100">interoperability</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/psafont">psafont</a> for investigation and <a href="https://github.com/mattjbray">mattjbray</a> for reporting). This library feels very mature now - being used by multiple stakeholders, and lots of issues have been fixed in 2020.</p>
<h3 id="Qubes-Firewall">Qubes Firewall</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mirage/qubes-mirage-firewall/">MirageOS based Qubes firewall</a> is the most widely used MirageOS unikernel. And it got major updates: in May <a href="https://github.com/linse">Steffi</a> <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/qubes-users/c/Xzplmkjwa5Y">announced</a> her and <a href="https://github.com/yomimono">Mindy's</a> work on improving it for Qubes 4.0 - including <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/vm-interface/#firewall-rules-in-4x">dynamic firewall rules via QubesDB</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://prototypefund.de/project/portable-firewall-fuer-qubesos/">prototypefund</a> for sponsoring.</p>
<p>In October 2020, we released <a href="https://mirage.io/blog/announcing-mirage-39-release">Mirage 3.9</a> with PVH virtualization mode (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/mato">mato</a>). There's still a <a href="https://github.com/mirage/qubes-mirage-firewall/issues/120">memory leak</a> to be investigated and fixed.</p>
<h3 id="IPv6">IPv6</h3>

<p>In December, with <a href="https://mirage.io/blog/announcing-mirage-310-release">Mirage 3.10</a> we got the IPv6 code up and running. Now MirageOS unikernels have a dual stack available, besides IPv4-only and IPv6-only network stacks. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/nojb">nojb</a> for the initial code and <a href="https://github.com/MagnusS">MagnusS</a>.</p>
<p>Turns out this blog, but also robur services, are now available via IPv6 :)</p>
<h3 id="Albatross">Albatross</h3>

<p>Also in December, I pushed an initial release of <a href="https://github.com/roburio/albatross">albatross</a>, a unikernel orchestration system with remote access. <em>Deploy your unikernel via a TLS handshake -- the unikernel image is embedded in the TLS client certificates.</em></p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/reynir">reynir</a> for statistics support on Linux and improvements of the systemd service scripts. Also thanks to <a href="https://github.com/cfcs">cfcs</a> for the initial Linux port.</p>
<h3 id="CA-certs">CA certs</h3>

<p>For several years I postponed the problem of how to actually use the operating system trust anchors for OCaml-TLS connections. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/emillon">emillon</a> for initial code, there are now <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ca-certs">ca-certs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ca-certs-nss">ca-certs-nss</a> opam packages (see <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-ca-certs-and-ca-certs-nss">release announcement</a>) which fills this gap.</p>
<h2 id="Unikernels">Unikernels</h2>

<p>I developed several useful unikernels in 2020, and also pushed <a href="https://mirage.io/wiki/gallery">a unikernel gallery</a> to the Mirage website:</p>
<h3 id="Traceroute-in-MirageOS">Traceroute in MirageOS</h3>

<p>I already wrote about <a href="https://hannes.robur.coop/Posts/Traceroute">traceroute</a> which traces the routing to a given remote host.</p>
<h3 id="Unipi-static-website-hosting">Unipi - static website hosting</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/roburio/unipi">Unipi</a> is a static site webserver which retrieves the content from a remote git repository. Let's encrypt certificate provisioning and dynamic updates via a webhook to be executed for every push.</p>
<h4 id="TLSTunnel-TLS-demultiplexing">TLSTunnel - TLS demultiplexing</h4>

<p>The physical machine this blog and other robur infrastructure runs on has been relocated from Sweden to Germany mid-December. Thanks to UPS! Fewer IPv4 addresses are available in the new data center, which motivated me to develop <a href="https://github.com/roburio/tlstunnel">tlstunnel</a>.</p>
<p>The new behaviour is as follows (see the <code>monitoring</code> branch):</p>
<ul><li>listener on TCP port 80 which replies with a permanent redirect to <code>https</code></li><li>listener on TCP port 443 which forwards to a backend host if the requested server name is configured</li><li>its configuration is stored on a block device, and can be dynamically changed (with a custom protocol authenticated with a HMAC)</li><li>it is setup to hold a wildcard TLS certificate and in DNS a wildcard entry is pointing to it</li><li>setting up a new service is very straightforward: only the new name needs to be registered with tlstunnel together with the TCP backend, and everything will just work</li></ul>

<h2 id="2021">2021</h2>

<p>The year started with a release of <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-first-release-of-awa-ssh">awa</a>, a SSH implementation in OCaml (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/haesbaert">haesbaert</a> for initial code). This was followed by a <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-release-of-ocaml-git-v3-0-duff-encore-decompress-etc/">git 3.0 release</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/dinosaure">dinosaure</a>).</p>
<h3 id="Deploying-MirageOS-NGI-Pointer">Deploying MirageOS - NGI Pointer</h3>

<p>For 2021 we at robur received funding from the EU (via <a href="https://pointer.ngi.eu/">NGI pointer</a>) for "Deploying MirageOS", which boils down into three parts:</p>
<ul><li>reproducible binary releases of MirageOS unikernels,</li><li>monitoring (and other devops features: profiling) and integration into existing infrastructure,</li><li>and further documentation and advertisement.</li></ul>

<p>Of course this will all be available open source. Please get in touch via eMail (team aT robur dot coop) if you're eager to integrate MirageOS unikernels into your infrastructure.</p>
<p>We discovered at an initial meeting with an infrastructure provider that a DNS resolver is of interest - even more now that dnsmasq suffered from <a href="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DNSpooq_Technical-Whitepaper.pdf">dnspooq</a>. We are already working on an <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-dns/pull/251">implementation of DNSSec</a>.</p>
<p>MirageOS unikernels are binary reproducible, and <a href="https://github.com/rjbou/orb/pull/1">infrastructure tools are available</a>. We are working hard on a web interface (and REST API - think of it as "Docker Hub for MirageOS unikernels"), and more tooling to verify reproducibility.</p>
<h3 id="Conex-securing-the-supply-chain">Conex - securing the supply chain</h3>

<p>Another funding from the <a href="http://ocaml-sf.org/">OCSF</a> is to continue development and deploy <a href="https://github.com/hannesm/conex">conex</a> - to bring trust into opam-repository. This is a great combination with the reproducible build efforts, and will bring much more trust into retrieving OCaml packages and using MirageOS unikernels.</p>
<h3 id="MirageOS-4-0">MirageOS 4.0</h3>

<p>Mirage so far still uses ocamlbuild and ocamlfind for compiling the virtual machine binary. But the switch to dune is <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage/issues/1195">close</a>, a lot of effort has been done. This will make the developer experience of MirageOS much more smooth, with a per-unikernel monorepo workflow where you can push your changes to the individual libraries.</p>


<p>If you want to support our work on MirageOS unikernels, please <a href="https://robur.coop/Donate">donate to robur</a>. I'm interested in feedback, either via <a href="https://twitter.com/h4nnes">twitter</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@hannesm">hannesm@mastodon.social</a> or an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/hannesm/hannes.nqsb.io/issues">data repository</a>.</p>

	<!-- .entry-header -->

	<div>
		<p>There is a book by Wall Street Journal reporter Zuckerman, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Solved-Market-Revolution/dp/073521798X">The Man Who Solved the Market: How Jim Simons Launched the Quant Revolution</a>, about James Harris Simons–a former mathematician, physicist, and code breaker–who launched arguably the most successful hedge fund ever, Renaissance Technologies, which for decades has posted annual returns in excess of 40%,  making it by far the most successful hedge fund ever. Equally impressive is that in the nearly 40 years of its existence, Renaissance has never had a down year. Unfortunately but understandably, Harris’ methodology of how he ‘solved’ Wall Street remains opaque in spite of intense interest and sleuthing online, but one can infer that it involves various ‘statistical methods,’ which is still hopelessly vague but the best we can infer with the information Zuckerman and others have supplied.</p>
<p>But move over Harris, because there is a cadre of traders who also appear to have ‘solved the market,’ but unlike Harris, they make their trades openly public for ‘bragging rights’ and ‘meme value.’ But Renaissance Technologies is in a league of its own in terms of uninterrupted, smooth returns, but in terms of absolute returns, especially at an endeavor in which so few beat the market, these new traders possibly have him beat. </p>
<p>But let’s go back  a bit in history. For years, probably as far back as the late ’90s, message boards and blogs dominated online financial discourse. Then came Twitter, along with YouTube, creating new avenues for traders share wins, losses, and strategies . Sites such as StockTwits, which leveraged the Twitter platform and popularized ‘dollar hashtags’ (such as $AAPL for Apple), grew in popularity. By 2013-2015 or so, at its peak, the ‘finance sphere’ was composed of YouTube channels (such as Tasty Trade, which makes me cringe just typing it out), blogs (such as Seeking Alpha, which aggregates many blogs, and also individually-run blogs), popular message boards (such as Elite Trader and Yahoo Finance message boards), StockTwits (which still exists but is full of ads and is a shadow of its former popularity, having been subsumed by Twitter), trading podcasts, and also Reddit.  </p>
<p>Looking back, I only realize now that that all those platforms had one thing in common: no was actually making money . Except for proprietors of newsletters, as well as YouTube channels and blogs that collected ad revenue, the actual traders themselves tended to either lose money or make only table scraps. In spite of this torrent of content, the one thing everyone was ultimately seeking–profits–was out of reach or only a pittance.</p>
<p>Then in 2015, the Reddit sub /r/WallStreetBets changed all of that. Suddenly people were making money for a change, posting verifiable screenshots and video screenshot captures of substantial returns. In any given day, one can easily find many posts  of option traders turning thousands or even hundreds of dollars into <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8tbz0/recovered_4_months_40k_from_pltr_yolo/">tens</a> of thousand, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63ykM9PBNK8&amp;feature=youtu.be">hundreds</a> of thousand, or even <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8n3io/1m_from_460_video_so_the_haters_among_you_dont/">millions</a> of dollars of profit. Other are making substantial, market-beating returns with ‘buy and hold,’ without options, which tend to be riskier than stocks but produce far greater returns. Of course, given the inherently risky nature of options and leverage, some traders on WallStreetBets also lose substantial sums of money (getting rekt, blowing up, or washed-out, as it’s called), posting screenshots of the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8i3ko/105000_gone_in_30_days_fucked_myself_bigtime_on/">losses</a> in all their glory. One ‘degenerate’ [as part of the in-group culture and lingo, traders on WallStreetBets often refer to each other as degenerates or autists, which is not at all that inaccurate of a description], for example, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k30ty7/410k_of_losses_over_8_months/">lost</a> $400k on ill-timed Tesla options. In regard to the above links of massive wins, it is not like I am cherry-picking: all of these were selected within a single day, going no deeper than 2 pages within the sub. On any given day, one can easily find at least three or more screenshots and other documented evidence of substantial profits, all within the first page. </p>
<p>Memes and jokes aside, we’re talking big money. Millions of dollars is nothing to scoff at, especially given the statistically improbable and high frequency of such profitable trades, all fully disclosed to the public, and the inherent difficulty of trading and ‘beating the market,’ which is a goal retail speculators and institutional investors alike  aspire to but many fall short of, so seeing these ‘autists and degenerates’ post the sort of consistent returns that make Google salaries seem small by comparison, is bound to draw some attention. Consequently, after relative obscurity in 2015, WallStreetBets has exploded in popularity over the past few years as the Trump bull market and the even bigger bull market in tech stocks has enriched speculators greatly, and whipped people up into a get-rich-quick frenzy, and especially since Covid, as young people find themselves with ample free time and money (in spite of joblessness and ‘tough times’, there always seems to be money to trade).</p>
<p>So back to James Simmons, I believe, contrary to EMH purists, that actual trading ‘skill’ exists, and that returns comparable Renaissance Technologies, or even greater, are possible, and that there are traders on /r/WallStreetBets who are doing that now (sure, they do not have billions of dollars, but you have to start somewhere, and small, successful strategies can be scaled up). The common retort is that if losses and wins follow a normal distribution, then we would expect given a large enough pool of traders that some traders on the tail-end of the distribution will appear very successful and have a long string of big wins, by pure chance. Yet empirical observation seems to suggest otherwise.  Despite the large losses, it is evident some traders have a knack for making consistent, large profits, and that some strategies are superior to others, with far greater frequency that can be attributed by chance alone. Even if unsuccessful traders are disinclined to post their results on /r/WallStreetBets, there are enough large winning trades and successful traders, that we can infer such a strategy. Even hedge funds are taking notice , trying to elicit such tradable and replicable strategies and gems from the pile of memes and ‘shitposts’. </p>
<p>So why is WallStreetBets, large losses not withstanding, so successful , when all prior communities failed to deliver on actual profits? My belief, again deferring to HBD, is that the addition of 20 or more extra IQ points from the generally high-IQ Reddit community created superior strategies. The blogs and communities that predated WallStreetBets focused mostly on technical analysis (annotating stock charts with lines and diagrams to predict price direction) and small cap stocks (penny stocks are often very popular on stock massage boards and blogs, yet few people make money trading them), but those strategies are inferior to the strategies the successful traders on WallStreetBets employ. Eschewing technical analysis or small cap stocks, traders on WallStreetBets focus instead on dominant, big tech companies and employ a more holistic, fundamental approach and ignore chart patterns. Traders on WallStreetBets correctly deduced that the ‘easy money’ is made with $50-500+ billion companies such AMZN and TSLA, not small or medium-sized stocks, which tend to be more volatile and give up their gains too easily, whereas mega-cap tech stocks such as Tesla and Amazon hold their gains, have less volatility, and have superior absolute returns compared to smaller stocks despite being orders of magnitude bigger (Tesla stock, for example, despite being worth $600 billion , was up 700% for 2020). </p>
<p>A possible objection is that, sure, we can go back in time and find successes such as Tesla and Amazon, but how do we know this is not just luck, versus skill? Maybe they just got lucky in choosing those stocks and that the luck will run out. But consider the recent success of Palantir (PLTR). As soon as Palantir went public on September  30th, WallStreetBets traders immediately honed in on it and began buying. For example, one trader <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j3fdws/i_went_yolo_on_palantir_ipo_yesterday/">bought</a> shares as soon as it began trading, on the IPO, at what was then $9/share. Palantir, just 2 months later,  trades at  $27/share–a gain of 200%, far surpassing the S&amp;P 500, which was only up 15% year-to-date. Scanning the archives of WallStreetBets, one finds dozens of instances of traders speculating, correctly, that Palantir would go higher and profiting greatly by buying call options on Palantir or buying shares outright, typically on Robinhood. Many traders have made six figures in profit doing so.   So out of a pool of thousands of companies to choose from, WallStreetBets correctly singled out Palantir, one of the strongest-performing stocks of the past 2 months even before it it gained 200%. This is demonstrative of actual skill and not just guessing. </p>
<p>Hedge funds spend inordinate amounts of money hiring some of the smartest PHDs and other credentialed experts to find strategies that may give their funds even just a small edge over the S&amp;P 500 or some other benchmark, yet the retail traders on WallStreetBets appear to leave these experts in the dust. Sure, in fairness, hedge funds seek to minimize volatility whereas WallStreetBets  traders appear inured by the volatility that comes with trading highly speculative call options, yet it would at the same time seem as if they have found a strategy that otherwise was overlooked by the experts. The experts have been trying to time the bottom on value stocks and commodity stocks, for years, to no avail, but WallStreetBets traders chose growth, market dominance, and size over cheapness.  By possessing above-average IQs and a strong and reliable intuition about how the market works, WallStreetBets traders were able to ferret-out–much like how James Harris, who is a genius, was able to find winning strategies–that buying call options and or ‘buying and holding’ these handful of large, dominant tech …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>In the confusing jungle of transpiler languages for JavaScript, there are some gems. <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TypeScript</a> is mainstream, <a href="https://rescript-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ReScript</a> is starting to establish itself, and <a href="https://elm-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elm</a> is still an insider tip. This article takes a detailed look at ReScript – but also sheds light on the limitations of the young language. In what projects does its use make sense? What projects should rather use TypeScript on the one hand or Elm on the other?</i></p><p>In web environments, nothing works without JavaScript. Not surprisingly, JavaScript is a popular <a href="http://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">target language for transpilers</a> – compilers that do not convert to bytecode but into the source code of another language. Teams like to use transpiler languages such as TypeScript, ReScript, or Elm for their advantages like static typing, modern language features, or support for functional programming. Static typing and functional programming are of particular interest here.</p><h2>Static typing</h2><p>The topic of static typing is highly controversial and often leads to religious wars. A strong type system helps detect and avoid errors. But whether type checks should happen at runtime or at compile time is a matter of opinion. More objectively, there are arguments for both sides. Clear advantages of static type systems are</p><ul><li>early error detection (type safety)</li><li>auto-completion</li><li>documentation</li><li>optimizations</li></ul><h3>Type safety</h3><p>The costs for the removal of a defect depend on the moment of its discovery. If an error is discovered that has just occurred, it is usually quickly found and corrected. An error that a customer discovers months later in production often takes considerably more time to fix. Almost every experienced developer has an anecdote about how he or she spent three days looking for a bug.</p><p>Static typing helps detect certain error classes at an early stage and thus avoid efforts like debugging. Test-driven development (TDD) has the same effect. However, type safety and TDD address different error classes. A combination of both is desirable. The claim that static typing alone leads to less error-prone code is controversial – scientific studies have not been able to <a href="https://danluu.com/empirical-pl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prove it</a>.</p><h2>Auto-completion &amp; Documentation</h2><p>In many web projects it is not uncommon to constantly use new APIs from libraries or even other project teams. In this respect, a good autocomplete in the IDE can save a lot of time. Even without auto-completion, type specifications serve as documentation and help to understand functions faster.</p><h4>Optimization</h4><p>A compiler/transpiler that knows the type of a value can sometimes perform optimizations in the generated code that would otherwise not be possible.</p><h4>Costs of static typing</h4><p>On the other hand, it is necessary to consider the costs of static typing. These include:</p><ul><li>Code noise</li><li>additional effort due to type conversion</li><li>higher compiler runtimes</li><li>increased complexity</li></ul><h3>Code noise</h3><p>Code noise means that the readability of code can deteriorate significantly when many type annotations obscure the view. JavaScript blogger Eric Elliot calls this <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-typescript-tax-132ff4cb175b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TypeScript tax</a> and questions the return of investment of static type systems.</p><h3>Effort, complexity &amp; compilation time</h3><p><strong>Additional effort</strong> may be required if it is necessary to convert values into other types, e.g. to pass them to an external function. <strong>Long compilation times</strong> can cause developers to lose focus while waiting for the result of a change – a frustrating experience for experimental tasks. Finally, a static type system comes with its own set of concepts that need to be mastered – resulting in an <strong>increase in complexity</strong>.</p><h2>Exploiting the type system</h2><p>Since static type systems have advantages and disadvantages, there are two strategies:</p><p><strong>Option 1:</strong> The team forgoes a type system and thus the benefits, but also the costs – the language of choice is classic JavaScript or <a href="https://picostitch.com/blog/2020/05/12-typescript-for-javascript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TypeScript without type annotations</a>. This option is often ridiculed, but it can be a legitimate choice. To ensure the quality of the software, high test coverage is even more important here.</p><p><strong>Option 2:</strong> The team tries to exploit the type system as much as possible. That is, it is important to maximize the advantages and minimize the disadvantages. Some features of the type system can help: Type inference and structural typing can minimize code noise and refactoring efforts. Discriminated unions help write code that is as error-free as possible and detect problems at compile time – more on this later.</p><h2>Functional programming</h2><p>An increasing number of JavaScript developers are discovering functional programming for themselves – libraries such as underscore, <a href="https://lodash.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lodash</a> or <a href="https://ramdajs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RamdaJS</a> have long been favorites of many teams. The functional-inspired <em>React</em> is considered the most popular UI-framework and even the classic object-oriented <em>Angular</em> relies on a variant of functional programming in the form of <a href="https://rxjs.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RxJS</a>. The strengths of functional programming include:</p><ul><li><strong>Immutable</strong> data structures</li><li>A <strong>stateless</strong> programming model</li><li>Simple <strong>composition</strong> of functions</li><li>Reduction of complexity</li></ul><p>One of the big problems of imperative programming is the so-called <em>Mutable State</em> – i.e. a state that can be changed. The fact that the state changes means that the code at runtime can differ significantly from the code that the IDE shows statically. As a result, a debugger is often required to understand what the code is doing in the first place. Functional programming minimizes the problem by avoiding mutable state. To ensure that this is possible in performant way, the language must be optimized for this, or the team uses an appropriate library, such as <a href="https://github.com/immerjs/immer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Immer</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://github.com/rtfeldman/seamless-immutable" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seamless-immutable</a>.</p><p>However, libraries can extend JavaScript only to a limited extent. Some concepts require direct language support.</p><h2>Transpiler languages</h2><p>Transpiler languages like TypeScript, ReScript, and Elm help by providing a static type system and support for functional concepts.</p><h2>TypeScript</h2><p>TypeScript hardly needs an introduction, as it is the most popular of the transpiler languages. The <a href="https://2019.stateofjs.com/javascript-flavors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">State of JS 2019</a> study also reported the highest developer satisfaction:</p><div id="attachment_79461"><p><a href="https://2019.stateofjs.com/javascript-flavors"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-79461" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/12/stateofjs-1024x282.png" alt="State of JS 2017 - Language Flavors: Developer Satisfaction" width="1024" height="282" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/12/stateofjs-1024x282.png 1024w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/12/stateofjs-1280x352.png 1280w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/12/stateofjs-768x211.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/12/stateofjs-400x110.png 400w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/12/stateofjs.png 1337w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-79461">State of JS 2019 – Language Flavors: Developer Satisfaction</p></div><p>A closer look reveals that TypeScript does not resemble rigid type systems of well-known OOP languages; rather it has features that are more reminiscent of functional languages. These include, among others:</p><ul><li>Structural typing and <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-compatibility.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">structural subtyping</a></li><li>An algebraic type system including <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/unions-and-intersections.html#discriminating-unions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discriminated union types</a></li></ul><h3>Structural typing</h3><p>TypeScript relies on so-called <em>structural typing</em>, i. e. not the name of a type is relevant (<em>nominal typing</em>), but the structure. Here is an example:</p><div><pre>type Person = { firstName: string; lastName: string };
type User = { firstName: string; lastName: string };
type Dog = { firstName: string };

let person1: Person = { firstName: "Alice", lastName: "Foo" };
let user1: User = { firstName: "Bob", lastName: "Bar" };
let dog1: Dog = { firstName: "Wuffy" };

let greet1 = (person: Person) =&gt;`Hello ${person.firstName}`;

greet1(person1); //OK
greet1(user1);   //OK
greet1(dog1);    // =&gt; Error (as expected)</pre></div><p>This brings some advantages: converting a value to match the type is not necessary. As long as the structure is the same, TypeScript accepts the value. This is also a prerequisite for so-called <em>structural subtyping</em> – a concept similar to <em>duck typing</em> that is only available in dynamic languages:</p><div><div><pre>let greet2 = (person: { firstName: string }) =&gt;`Hello ${person.firstName}`;

greet2(person1); //OK
greet2(dog1);    //OK, the obj has prop "firstName"
greet2(27);      // =&gt; Error (as expected)</pre></div><p>Function <em>greet2</em> accepts any object as long as the subtype <em>“an object with firstName of type string”</em> is fulfilled. Whether or not the object has other properties, such as <em>lastName</em>, is irrelevant for the call of <em>greet2</em>.</p></div><h3>Discriminated union types</h3><p>To maximize the error detection of a type system, it is important to design types correctly: valid values must be representable in the type system, invalid ones must be rejected. Domain-driven design calls this <em>enforcing invariants</em> (see <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/179133.Domain_Driven_Design?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=Kq7YXEJnKH&amp;rank=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software</a>). Of course, it is easy to code checks that enforce invariants at runtime. However, a good type system checks for invariants at compile time. Here&nbsp;an example with so-called <em>discriminated union types</em>:</p><div><pre>type Color = "green" | "red" | "blue";

type Circle = {
  kind: "Circle";
  radius: number;
};

type Rectangle = {
  kind: "Rectangle";
  height: number;
  width: number;
};

type Shape = Circle | Rectangle;

let circle1: Shape = { kind: "Circle", radius: 10 };       //OK
let <em>rectangle1</em>: Shape = { kind: "Rectangle", radius: 10 }; //Error correctly detected
let <em>rectangle2</em> = { kind: "Rectangle", radius: 10 };        //OK, but should be an Error</pre></div><p>In the case of <em>color</em>, the union type still looks like a simple <em>enum</em>. However, <em>shape</em> should make clear that different variants of shapes can also bring different data. A shape here is either a circle or a rectangle. Circles have a <em>radius</em>, rectangles <em>height</em> and <em>width</em>. A rectangle must not have a <em>radius</em>.</p><p>If a value (here: the variable <em>rectangle1</em>) is marked as a shape, TypeScript can detect the error – in our case: rectangle with radius. Sidenote: <em>kind</em> is not a keyword of the language, any identifier is possible.</p><p>If the type annotation is missing, as is the case with <em>rectangle2</em>, the type system of TypeScript unfortunately fails to detect the error. TypeScript is considered <a href="http://logan.tw/posts/2014/11/12/soundness-and-completeness-of-the-type-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unsound</a>. ReScript goes a step further here and can detect the error with <em>rectangle2</em> using type inference – more about this later.</p><h3>AnyScript</h3><p>The TypeScript type system is particularly helpful for teams that have the discipline to type consistently. However, TypeScript also provides the ability to gradually type less. This is a useful feature for teams that plan to migrate existing JavaScript code to TypeScript piece by piece. The downside, however, is that it can cause the team to neglect typing. The temptation is always near to assign an <em>any</em> instead of a difficult type annotation or even to switch off the typing by means of an <em>@ts-ignore</em> comment.</p><p>What saves time at first usually takes its toll later on, namely when the compiler …</p></div></div>

				<p>Latches and barriers are coordination types that enable some threads to wait until a counter becomes zero. You can use a <code>std::latch</code> only once, but you can use a <code>std::barrier</code> more than once. Today, I have a closer look at latches.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/LatchesAndBarriers/TimelineCpp20.png" alt="TimelineCpp20" width="650" height="224"></p>
<p>Concurrent invocations of the member functions of a <code>std::latch</code> or a <code>std::barrier</code> are no data race. A data race is such a crucial term in concurrency that I want to write more words to it.</p>
<h2 id="h1-data-race">Data Race</h2>
<p>A data race is a situation, in which at least two threads access a shared variable at the same time and at least one thread tries to modify the variable. If your program has a data race, it has undefined behavior. This means all outcomes are possible and therefore, reasoning about the program makes no sense anymore.</p>
<p>Let me show you a program with a data race.</p>

<p>100 threads adding 50 euros to the same account (1) using the function <code>addMoney</code> (2). The initial account is 100 (3). The crucial observation is that the writing to the account is done without synchronization. Therefore&nbsp;we have a data race and, consequently, undefined behavior. The final balance is between 5000 and 5100 euro (4).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/LatchesAndBarriers/addMoney.png" alt="addMoney"></p>
<p>What is happening? Why are a few additions missing? The update process <code>to.balance <span>+=</span> amount; </code>in line (1) is a so-called read-modify-write operation. As such, first, the old value of <code>to.balance</code> is read, then it is updated, and finally is written. What may happen under the hood is the following. I use numbers to make my argumentation more obvious</p>
<ul>
<li>Thread A reads the value 500 euro and then Thread B kicks in.</li>
<li>Thread B read also the value 500 euro, adds 50 euro to it, and updates <code>to.balance</code> to 550 euro.</li>
<li>Now Thread A finished its execution by adding 50 euro to <code>to.balance</code> and also writes 550 euro.</li>
<li>Essential the value 550 euro is written twice and instead of two additions of 50 euro, we only observe one.</li>
<li>This means, that one modification is lost and we get the wrong final sum.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, there are two questions to answer before I present <code>std::latch</code> and <code>std::barrier</code> in detail.</p>
<h2 id="h2-two-questions">Two Questions<code><br></code></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is the difference between these two mechanisms to coordinate threads?</strong> You can use a <code>std::latch</code> only once, but you can use a <code>std::barrier</code> more than once. A <code>std::latch</code> is useful for managing one task by multiple threads; a<code> std::barrier</code> is helpful for managing repeated tasks by multiple threads. Additionally, a <code>std::barrier</code> enables you to execute a function in the so-called completion step. The completion step is the state when the counter becomes zero.</li>
<li><strong>What use cases do latches and barriers support that cannot be done in C++11 with futures, threads, or condition variables combined with locks?</strong> Latches and barriers address no new use cases, but they are a lot easier to use. They are also more performant because they often use a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm">lock-free </a>mechanism internally.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me continue my post with the simpler data type of both.</p>
<h2 id="h3-std-latch"><code>std::latch</code></h2>
<p>Now, let us have a closer look at the interface of a <code>std::latch</code>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/LatchesAndBarriers/memberFunctionsLatch.png" alt="memberFunctionsLatch" width="600" height="161"></p>
<p>The default value for <code>upd</code> is <code>1</code>. When <code>upd</code> is greater than the counter or negative, the behavior is undefined. The call <code>lat.try_wait()</code> does never wait as its name suggests.</p>
<p>The following program <code>bossWorkers.cpp</code> uses two <code>std::latch</code> to build a boss-workers workflow. I synchronized the output to <code>std::cout</code> using the function <code>synchronizedOut</code> (1). This synchronization makes it easier to follow the workflow.</p>

<p>The idea of the workflow is straightforward. The six workers <code>herb</code>, <code>scott</code>, <code>bjarne</code>, <code>andrei</code>, <code>andrew</code>, and <code>david</code> in the <code>main</code>-program have to fulfill their job. When they finished their job, they count down the <code>std::latch workDone</code> (2). The boss (<code>main</code>-thread) is blocked in line (3) until the counter becomes 0. When the counter is 0, the boss uses the second <code>std::latch goHome</code> to signal its workers to go home. In this case, the initial counter is <code>1</code> (4). The call g<code>oHome.wait</code> (5) blocks until the counter becomes 0.</p>

<p>When you think about this workflow, you may notice that it can be performed without a boss. Here is the modern variant:</p>

    andreiWork.join();
    andrewWork.join();
    davidWork.join();
  
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>There is not much to add to this simplified workflow. The call <code>workDone.arrive_and_wait(1)</code> (1) is equivalent to the calls <code>count_down(upd); wait();</code>. This means the workers coordinate themself and the boss is no longer necessary such as in the previous program <code>bossWorkers.cpp</code>.</p>

<h2 id="h4-what-s-next">What's next?</h2>
<p>A <code>std::barrier i</code>s quite similar to a <code>std::latch</code>. <code>std::barrier</code>'s strength is it to perform a job more than once. In my next post, I will have a closer look at barriers.</p>

    <p>I have an Ubuntu desktop machine with an old Nvidia card. It has OKish specs, but it is a bit noisy for my liking. In
short, I’ve made it into a publicly accessible Jellyfin media server with Traefik+Wireguard and moved it to the corner
of my place with USB WiFi stick plugged in.</p>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You have install kernel drivers for the WiFi stick first, and the drivers are vendor specific.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>check available devices</p>
  </li>
</ul>



<p><code>wlp4s0</code> is the device name for my USB WiFi stick.</p>

<ul>
  <li>bring the device up</li>
</ul>



<ul>
  <li>check available wireless networks</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>iwlist wlp4s0 scan | <span>grep </span>ESSID

  <li>
    <p>Disable WiFi power saving</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Disable wifi power management directly by editing <code>/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/default-wifi-powersave-on.conf</code> and
changed the value from 3 to 2, saved changes and reboot.</li>
    </ul>

<p>I’ve tried lots of things for remote desktop, then settled for Chrome Remote Desktop. Official docs are not so reliable, and this gist did
the trick.</p>

<p>Honestly I don’t use this at all, but I think it is nice to have.</p>




<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/organizm/ae09f72bd5badc64d4727a0d38fc590b">https://gist.github.com/organizm/ae09f72bd5badc64d4727a0d38fc590b</a></p>



<ul>
  <li>Jellyfin is free &amp; open source, and it is not bloated with ads.
Start Jellyfin with Nvidia hardware acceleration enabled(You can check out <a href="https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/hardware-acceleration.html">docs</a> for more). Docker-compose is buggy with GPUs, so I have to use command
line for this. You have to install <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker">nvidia-docker2</a> before hand.</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code>docker run <span>-d</span> <span>\</span>
 <span>--name</span><span>=</span>jellyfin <span>\</span>
 <span>-e</span> <span>NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES</span><span>=</span>all <span>\</span>
 <span>-e</span> <span>NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES</span><span>=</span>all <span>\</span>
 <span>--gpus</span> all <span>\</span>
 <span>--pid</span> host <span>\</span>
 <span>--runtime</span><span>=</span>nvidia <span>\</span>
 <span>-p</span> 8096:8096 <span>\</span>

 <span>-v</span> /data/jellyfin/config:/config <span>\</span>

 <span>-v</span> /data/jellyfin/cache:/cache <span>\</span>
 <span>--restart</span> unless-stopped <span>\</span>
 jellyfin/jellyfin:unstable
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since it is sharing(<code>--pid host</code>) PID namespace with host, you can run <code>nvidia-smi</code> on host machine directly to see if
Jellyfin is using GPU when transcoding content.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.lsgrep.com/images/jellyfin-nvidia.png" alt="jellyfin-nvidia"></p>

<ul>
  <li>Register an <a href="http://opensubtitles.org/">OpenSubtitles.org</a> account and install the plugin for the Jellyfin. You have
 to login with your account in the plugin settings page. With this you can add subtitles to your videos without too much effort.</li>
</ul>



<p><code>rclone</code> is kinda aggressive, so you have to use <code>--max-delete 0</code> to keep your files intact in your destination.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>rclone <span>sync</span> <span>--max-delete</span> 0 <span>-v</span> REMOTE_DRIVE:legal_movies movies <span>--stats</span> 10s
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>The desktop is connected to a VPS instance with WireGuard. WireGuard is pretty easy to setup.</p>

January 25, 2021 | https://panelbear.com/blog/why-not-open-source/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://panelbear.com/blog/why-not-open-source/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Let me start by saying that there's many open source projects that have successfully demonstrated that open-source can support a business, and I have great respect for them. I’m thinking of projects like <a href="https://sidekiq.org/" rel="noopener">Sidekiq</a>, <a href="https://sentry.io/" rel="noopener">Sentry</a>, and <a href="https://matomo.org/" rel="noopener">Matomo</a>, but there's plenty more.</p><p>As a developer, I also prefer having access to the source code for the systems I rely on. That way, I can inspect it, and even patch it for my specific needs whenever the license allows.</p><p>I’ve learned a lot by reading code written by more experienced people than me, mostly from open source projects like <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="noopener">Django</a>, <a href="https://github.com/twitter/finatra" rel="noopener">Finatra</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" rel="noopener">Kubernetes</a>, or <a href="https://reactjs.org/" rel="noopener">React</a> to name a few. Needless to say, I owe a lot to the open source community, and for that I will forever be grateful.</p><p>That said, I'm writing this from the angle of building a sustainable SaaS service <em>as a solo founder</em>. Your own context will influence whether my story is relatable to you.</p><h2>Been there, learned a lot</h2><p>I want to offer reliable software that I continue to maintain over the years, whether it’s open source or closed source, free or paid. However, I also need to be able to pay my bills. Ideally I'd build free, open-source software and still be able to afford a place to live (housing in Munich has gone insane). Unfortunately life's not that simple, and it doesn’t appear to work for most projects unless backed by established companies or those that happen to be at the right place at the right time. Donations could help, but odds are I won’t be able to support my livelihood with this model and continue to build and support the project.</p><p>So about three years ago I thought I had found the holy grail: I would develop the SaaS as an open source project that anyone could self-host, while offering a hosted version which I can manage for my customers. I assumed 90% of the users would just self-host it themselves, but it’d be a good enough compromise. So I went ahead, and did exactly <a href="https://traduora.com/" rel="noopener">that</a>.</p><p>Needless to say, I was very naive to think that running a business is the same as running an open source project. Just because lots of people and organizations use your software each month, doesn’t mean you can automatically support your livelihood.</p><p>But business model aside, the main issue comes along in the form of expectations regarding your commitment as an open source maintainer. For some reason, many people have come to expect open-source maintainers to deliver the same quality in the same amount of time that an entire team at a company could, and they want it for free. I learned that nothing makes people disappear faster from a GitHub thread than asking them if they want to contribute the code changes themselves.</p><p>This particular project I’m talking about has been downloaded more than half a million times (Docker pulls + GitHub clones) over the past two years. While this helped me raise awareness about the project, it did not lead to a successful business model on its own as I had (naively) assumed.</p><h2>What went wrong</h2><p>Back then, I choose to open source the project alongside a SaaS offering based on the following assumptions:</p><ul><li>It would lead to a healthier codebase, as more eyes were looking into it.</li><li>It would improve trust, as anyone can audit my code.</li><li>It would reduce the support burden, as people can look at past issues, and participate in the discussion threads.</li><li>It would help me drive growth, as marketing is not my strength.</li><li>The community would help me build new features for their specific use cases.</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, almost all points above were false assumptions in my case. And sometimes it actually led to the opposite result. I won't dive into each point, but the main issue that this created for me was: increased operational burden as a solo-founder. If I was working together with a small team, the story may be different.</p><p>That said, there are many people who did contribute to the project, and for that I’m very grateful. It’s just unfortunate that they’re by far the minority.</p><p>Also I made the mistake of trying to be everything for everyone. I was too focused on developing every feature, trying to give support to every single ticket, and I completely ignored the marketing aspects of it as I had no time for it. It also made it really difficult to understand which issues to prioritize, and which ones might lead to more people supporting the business.</p><p>Not only that, but things like backwards compatibility for those self-hosting, handling support requests via email and chat groups, providing assistance to those installing it on incompatible platforms, were just taking away too much of my time. I was a solo founder, wearing all hats, prioritizing everything that came my way. Looking back, I ask myself: how could that work?</p><p>So while the project was used by several organizations, I quickly realized that it wasn't going to pay the bills given the time I was putting into it. Very soon I lost what helped me push along the whole way: my motivation. I knew while the project was of relative success on the open source front, it would require massive effort on my side to turn things around operationally and business-wise. However, without motivation, it’s easier said than done. The spark had simply faded away.</p><p>I did learn a lot out of this experience, and that's also why I have a lot of appreciation for those who have managed to get it right. I once read that making software is only 30% of what makes a tech company, and while I cannot confirm that number is accurate, the idea behind it rings true to me.</p><p>In short, like everyone else, I only have a limited amount of time in this world, and I have a life with family and friends to live too. Over the years I’ve had to re-evaluate how much time I'm willing to allocate to supporting each project.</p><p>So it needs to be sustainable if I want to do this for the long-term. I do continue to support every project I open source, but have reduced the release frequency to about twice per year. The main exception is security issues, which I do try to handle as soon as humanly possible.</p><p>I really don't want to be that guy that cannot be relied on, but I have other things going on in my life, just like everyone else, and have to watch out for my health too. Running a business, contributing to open-source, getting everything to run on the latest M1 chips is fun stuff, but so is living a full life with your loved ones.</p><h2>Pick your battles</h2><p>Last year I launched a new service, <a href="https://panelbear.com/" rel="noopener">Panelbear</a>, which is what the rest of this post is about. In short, it's a simple performance monitoring + website analytics SaaS that I started last September. It's fully self-funded, but this time I’m not open sourcing it from the start.</p><p>In the past, when it came to running a business <em>as a solo-founder</em>, having it open source created too much maintenance burden for very specific feature requests. In particular from non-paying users, who sometimes sent me emails directly, demanding I look at their issue, or help them fix things “as soon as possible”.</p><p>I am now trying another approach, and so far it’s more sustainable in my case. I have a better idea of which features to prioritize based on paying customers, which surprisingly tend to be more respectful of my time when they needed support.</p><p>Not being open source from the start, means I’ve been able to pivot and reinvent features more easily, as there’s not many “breaking changes” to coordinate (except for public APIs and libraries), or self-hosted deployments to support. I’m able to move faster because there’s only one deployment environment to support (or two if you count staging).</p><p>It’s also much more sustainable to build and grow a product at a pace in which it’s “just a thing I do” along with other things going on in my life, while being able to cover your expenses. There’s a saying: “slow is smooth, smooth is fast”, which feels very fitting in this case.</p><h2>I continue to open-source, when it makes sense</h2><p>Don't get me wrong, I do rely on, and continue to contribute to many open-source projects. I would have never gotten this far without the amazing community that continues to build, and support all these projects on their own time.</p><p>It's not entirely out of the question if I might one day reconsider, and open-source new projects. But for now I'll mainly open up libraries, and utilities, with a much smaller scope. That way I can afford to provide support for them, and hopefully more people are able to contribute since the codebase is smaller.</p><p>One day I might write a blog post reflecting on my second SaaS. That's the joy of the journey, there’s always something to learn.</p></div></div></div>]]>

                    <p>An alarm clock for the rest of us</p><p>It’s a brand new year, which means I should really start writing a new post.
I’ve been wanting to for a while, but we’ve been in lockdown for two months now and Google Analytics is the only indication that I’m not alone on the planet, and most of that is bots anyway.
I’ve decided to take a page out of the book of my friend, <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/">James Stanley</a>, who both does cool things <em>and</em> actually writes about them, so I’m starting to document all my projects again.</p>
<p>Given my non-frenetic, slow-paced lifestyle, I’ve long had a non-burning need.
I don’t use an alarm to wake up, as I start work late, but I still want to know what time it is when I wake up, just to see if it’s way too early and I can go to sleep again.
A few days a week I have tennis and need to get up early, but if it’s windy or rainy or very cold, the practice gets canceled and I want to know before I’m awake enough to not be able to go to sleep again.</p>
<p>To accommodate this lifestyle, I’ve traditionally turned to my mobile phone, but that has some disadvantages.
Namely, the screen is too bright and wakes me up when I check the time, and I’m too obsessive to not check all my messages instead of falling asleep when I see the notifications on the screen.
I’ve long thought that a bedside alarm clock would be perfect for me, but I couldn’t find one that fulfilled all my requirements:</p>
<!-- break -->

<ul>
<li>I needed something that had a screen that would always be always lit, so I could check the time with one eye and half a brain awake, in the complete darkness of the bedroom.</li>
<li>A screen that wasn’t too bright and wouldn’t disturb sleep, but that would also be legible in direct sunlight, so I could see the time during the day.
This meant adaptive brightness.</li>
<li>Octagonal shape so I can lay it down on its side (or at 45°) instead of having to crane my neck up to check the time when lying down (I really did think of everything).</li>
<li>Weather forecast for the next hour or two, so I can reliably fail to wake up for tennis when not necessary.</li>
<li>Annoying beeper for alarms.</li>
<li>Less annoying built-in LEDs that would increase in brighness for a few minutes before an alarm went off, so I can wake up less annoyed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the result:</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot2.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot2-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>Look at this sexy thing.</span></p></div><p>Sexy.</p>
<h2>Designing this thing</h2>
<p>Conceptually, making an alarm clock to fulfill these requirements isn’t hard.
You take a small OLED screen, an ESP8266, connect them together, add some LEDs and a buzzer, and you’re done!
Since the hardware was more-or-less straightforward, I started with designing the octagonal case:</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/clock-back.png" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/clock-back-small.png"></a></p><p><span>The back of the clock.</span></p></div><p>The OLED screen has four mounting holes, so I designed the mount around them.
For the ESP8266, I use a WeMos D1 Mini board, as it’s quite small and nice to work with.
I initially thought I’d have to connect the WeMos to the four pins of the screen with wires, but I discovered that if you kinda squint, you can get four of the ESP8266’s pins to match up with the screen’s pins and in the correct order, which means I could solder the ESP8266 behind the screen module directly, which simplified the wiring by a lot.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/mockup.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/mockup-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>Look at that subtle off-white coloring.</span></p></div><p>While designing the clock, I created a quick mockup of the screen as I wanted it to show.
I decided I wanted the hour to be displayed in as big letters as possible, since this screen is small, and the other elements I wanted were wind speed, temperature and weather forecast for the next hour.</p>
<p>The other components left to add were a photoresistor (for sensing ambient light), a buzzer and a LED strip.
They were all straightforward to add, the resistor is connected to the ESP8266’s analog pin, and the buzzer and LED strip to some other free pins.</p>
<h2>The software</h2>
<p>The software was the slightly trickier part in this build, although that was pretty straightforward too.
I needed multiple components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting the time somehow (there’s no real-time clock on the ESP8266 and I didn’t want to add one).</li>
<li>Dimming the screen in a pleasing manner.</li>
<li>Getting the weather forecast and current weather.</li>
<li>Connecting to WiFi and autoupdating.</li>
<li>Annoying me into wakefulness in a satisfactory manner.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The clock</h3>
<p>There’s an old Chinese saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>To know the time, you must first connect to the internet.</p>
<p>– Sun Inc</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily, connecting to the Internet is very easy with tzapu’s <a href="https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager">excellent WiFiManager</a> library.
The clock creates an access point, you join it with your phone or computer, give it your WiFi network’s password, and you’re done.</p>
<p>After connecting, an NTP library can fetch the time every so often from the closest server, so the clock is always up to date.
It was important to me that this clock is solid enough to trust with my most important wake-up alarms, and it achieves this goal admirably (unless the internet connection is down).</p>
<p>That also takes care of autoupdates, since I have a simple, secure autoupdate machine I set up using <a href="https://gitlab.com/stavros/espota-server">ESPOTA-server, an autoupdate server I wrote for the ESP8266</a>.
The clock checks for a new update every day, and automatically downloads and installs it.
This way, distributing updates will work reliably, even to millions of devices, for when you realize that collecting all the users’ personal data is slightly monetizable.</p>
<h3>The dimming</h3>
<p>After a bit (or a lot) of searching, I finally found how to dim the OLED screen, and another important feature was well on the way of being implemented.
Because it was rather hard to find, I’ll post the code here, along with the appropriate SEO keyword for people to be able to find it.
Here is the code for dimming an SSD1306-compatible, I2C 128x64 OLED screen:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>void</span> <span>brightnessTask</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>brightness</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Set the brightness of the SSD1306 OLED screen with this hack.</span>
    <span>// From https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFpXfSnDNSY.</span>
    <span>// `brightness` should be a value between 5 (for some reason) and 255.</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>SSD1306_SETCONTRAST</span><span>);</span> <span>//0x81</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>brightness</span><span>);</span>

    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>SSD1306_SETPRECHARGE</span><span>);</span> <span>//0xD9</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>

    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>SSD1306_SETVCOMDETECT</span><span>);</span> <span>//0xDB</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Once I discovered that, the rest of the dimming was easy:
I would just read the ambient light from the photoresistor and set the screen’s brightness according to the photoresistor’s value.</p>
<p>Another job <del>well</del> done.</p>
<h3>The weather</h3>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot1.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot1-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>What a beauty.</span></p></div><p>Getting the weather was easier than I thought.
<a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeather</a> has a simple API, which accepts a pair of coordinates and gives you the current weather and forecast for that location.
It only took a few minutes to fetch that data on the clock, and then I spent some time positioning them on the screen and turning the forecast into an appropriate icon so it could be displayed on the small screen.</p>
<p>To display the icons, I used <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/overview">Adafruit’s always helpful GFX library</a> and converted the OpenWeather icons to a format more suitable for display on a monochrome screen.
This took a bit of trial and error, as I wanted the icons to be easily distinguishable at a glance, even though their size was 12x12 pixels and just one color.
In the end, I think they worked out well, as it’s easy to tell if it’s raining or not.</p>
<h3>The wakefulness</h3>
<p>So the initial plan here was to have a buzzer buzz loudly and annoyingly in an attempt to wake me up.
However, I am a pretty light sleeper, and I hate loud and annoying sounds (surprisingly), so I wanted this to be a last resort.
The solution I came up with here is the following:</p>
<p>Say I want to set the alarm for 9:30, just in time to be ten minutes late for tennis.
The LEDs would start glowing very faintly at 9:20, slowly increasing in intensity over the next ten minutes, at which point they’d reach maximum.
If I still wasn’t up by then, the buzzer would begin beeping at the top of its lung, hopefully waking me up reliably.
This seemed like a pretty good algorithm, and one that would both wake me up pleasantly and reliably.</p>
<p>There was only one problem:
The clock doesn’t have any buttons or controls or any way for me to enter the alarm time.
I could create a web server where I could configure alarms, but I figured I’d rather get a rooster instead, so I did neither and just made an alarm clock that cannot alarm.
This symbolizes the futility of human existence and its incessant search for meaning in a cold and unfeeling universe that’s ultimately profoundly devoid of such, and then you die.</p>
<p>Not having to wake up to a buzzer is cool, though.</p>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>Overall, I’m pretty happy with this clock!
I can now open an eyelid, look at the time and fall asleep again, which is a massive quality-of-life improvement over the previous “fuck sleep I’ve got Instagram likes” situation.
The octagonal shape is a killer feature, I keep the clock angled 45° (as in the photo) and it really is the perfect angle for reading it while lying down.</p>
<p>One thing I’d like to improve in the future is to add a battery, because right now it’s solely USB powered and will obviously die if there’s a power outage. Adding a small LiPo battery and a charger circuit will be pretty easy and will ensure that the clock can keep running for hours even without power.</p>
<p>The source code is here:</p>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/stavros/do-not-be-alarmed">https://gitlab.com/stavros/do-not-be-alarmed</a></p>
<p>It’s not very complete, so use it at your own risk, and I haven’t really added deployment details, but it should be very easy to build with one PlatformIO command.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Generating APIs is becoming more and more popular. Especially the GraphQL community is "suffering" from this trend.
Production-ready APIs with authentication and caching in minutes, define the schema, and you're almost done.
As we all know, everything comes at a cost.
This post takes a critical look at generated GraphQL APIs, the benefits as well as the tradeoffs you're going to make.</p><h2>History and Trends<a href="#history-and-trends" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Generated GraphQL APIs look like a hot trend nowadays. Some venture backed companies push this topic hard to make it mainstream.
We hear praises of the amazing developer experience and how productive people are.
However, is this really a sustainable business?</p><p>If we look back a few years you might remember the term "Backend as a Service" (BaaS), established by companies like Parse.
The impact of parse, nowadays seems to be diminished. A lot of others jumped on the BaaS train, but except Firebase, you don't hear much on the topic nowadays.</p><p>Then came GraphQL and companies tried the same thing again.
If we look at the graveyard of failed companies you might find some familiar names like Reindex, Graphcool, etc...</p><p>Today, we have tools like Appsync and Hasura leading the pack, followed by many smaller companies who imitate them and try to diversify in various ways.</p><p>Appsync might be an outlier because their goal is not only BaaS but making AWS products easy to integrate, which is a different value proposition than their competition.</p><p>Another emerging trend is (Serverless) Databases as a Service.
dgraph offers a native GraphQL Database.
FaunaDB offers a Serverless Database which also comes with a GraphQL interface.
Then there's edgeDB which also offers a GraphQL interface.
I guess if you search for a while you'll find more.</p><p>Another quite popular category is Content Management Systems with GraphQL APIs.
The distinction from just BaaS is that these tools allow non-technical people to create content while developers can consume the content via GraphQL APIs.</p><p>How comes that the idea of BaaS/generated APIs keeps coming up while most of the implementations fail?</p><p>We might be able to look back in time to better understand why this approach is failing.
If you ask Prisma, the makers of Graphcool, they refer to this tweet:</p><blockquote><p>Exposing the database schema 1:1 via a generated graphql api totally misses the point of graphql - or an api as an intended abstraction.</p><p>-- <cite>Manuel Schoebel</cite></p></blockquote><p>We'll come back to this citation later.</p><h2>Developer experience of generated APIs<a href="#developer-experience-of-generated-apis" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>One feature of generated APIs you cannot deny is the developer experience.
If you're an experienced Full-Stack developer you're able to start new projects in minutes.
Spin up a database, define the schema, API done. You're now able to start building the frontend.</p><p>Some of the services allow you to build the schema using a user interface only.
This allows even less experienced Frontend developers to build their own "APIs".
You click a few buttons and your API with authentication is ready to use.</p><p>But what about maintenance?
How do you evolve applications built using this approach?
What if you don't just have one API consumer?</p><p>Let's have a look at possible use cases.</p><h2>Use cases of generated APIs<a href="#use-cases-of-generated-apis" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Generating APIs can be an amazing time-saver if you're a single developer, working on a small project.
You don't have to expose the API to other developers. It's just you using them.
You understand the tradeoffs, e.g. leaking some business logic into the client.
You're still happy because you saved a lot of time not having to build a backend.</p><p>Another good example where generated APIs can be very helpful is prototyping.
You want to bring an idea to life. You don't care about the quality of your API.
All you need is some CRUD methods to demonstrate an application to a prospect.</p><p>What about larger teams and projects? Are generated APIs also a good fit for enterprise use cases?</p><p>In order to answer this question, let's first have a look at what an API is.</p><h2>What is an API?<a href="#what-is-an-api" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>I'll not go into much detail of this topic, as I want to stay focused.
If you're interested to learn more about what an API is, I can highly recommend Erik Wilde <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDYeU2T4v2o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">talking about the topic</a>.</p><p>Too long, didn't watch:</p><p>An API is an interface, abstracting away an implementation of a contract.
In Eriks example, he explains how a weather forecast company exposes their forecasts through an API to other developers.</p><p>GraphQL is a Query language, offering one way of implementing APIs.</p><p>APIs make integrations scalable because we can rely on standards and don't have to understand every detail of a system.
E.g. if an API speaks GraphQL, clients know already how to interact with the system.
We can understand the API by issuing an introspection Query and from there on use the Queries and Mutations defined in the GraphQL schema.</p><p>Without tools like GraphQL, we had to invent custom contracts and integration tooling for every API.</p><p>One important aspect of the success of an API is its design.
APIs must be able to cover common use cases of API consumers.
E.g. a weather API is useless if it's almost impossible to get forecasts for the next few days in a very easy way.</p><p>Next, we'll look into API design to further understand why generated APIs don't scale.</p><h2>On good API design<a href="#on-good-api-design" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Going back to the weather forecast service, we talked about success factors of the API.
An API can also be seen as a product as it serves a specific purpose.</p><p>How can a weather forecast API be successful?
As with any other product, you have to talk to your users and adapt to their needs.
You have to re-shape your product to serve your customers well.</p><p>In case of an API, re-shaping means finding a good API design.</p><p>And with that, we're at the core of the problem of generated APIs.</p><p>It's impossible to design an API when all you do is deriving it from e.g. database tables.
A good API is not just making raw data accessible. A good API is driven by use cases, making it easy to integrate.
It doesn't have to be a public facing API. If you're providing an API to other developers it should be designed around their use-cases.
Deriving APIs from database schemas, tables or whatever it is means, you're not designing, you're not focussing on your users.</p><p>The consequences are well described by Erik:</p><blockquote><p>If you're designing an API by avoiding designing it, you end up with the design you deserve.</p><p>-- <cite>Erik Wilde</cite></p></blockquote><p>If you skip the design phase, you'll end up with unhappy users.
If your company depends on the success of your APIs, this could be a deal breaker.</p><p>Imagine you're an engineer and your task is to build a new steering wheel for a car.
You'll take the whole description of the CAN-BUS (internal communication system) description of the car and "generate" a panel of knobs from it.
This steering wheel might have thousands of buttons and is barely usable.</p><p>Wouldn't it make more sense to figure out how people would want to steer a car?
What knobs they need on it to control the radio without losing control of the car?
Once you have figured out the requirements you could then start mocking a few designs.
With those designs you'd then go to users and test if they work they way you expect.
You'll then iterate your ideas until you find a good design.
Only then, you'll actually build a real steering wheel.
One that you're confident will solve the problem of your user.</p><p>What's different from a steering wheel and the API of your service?
Why is it not obvious that generated APIs don't solve the problem.</p><p>You'd be much faster generating a steering wheel because you don't have to spend time designing and implementing it.
If you're the only user of your steering wheel, this might work because you know all about CAN-BUS systems.
However, this approach won't scale if you want to build APIs for other teams and companies.</p><h2>Information hiding principle<a href="#information-hiding-principle" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Another important aspect of APIs is abstraction and information hiding.</p><p>API consumers should not have to think about the implementation.
But what if the API is leaking implementation details?</p><p>Let's have a look at this simple example:</p><p>Even if the language is GraphQL, it's clear that we're talking to a relational database and SQL is used behind the scenes.</p><p>Should an API consumer have to think about primary keys? Isn't that a concern of storing data, a completely different layer?</p><p>How about JSON selectors as arguments?</p><p>Isn't the implementation leaking information on how data is being stored?</p><p>Here's another example where GraphQL is being abused as an ORM.</p><p>The consequence of these examples is that it's almost impossible to make changes to the implementation.</p><p>Developers who know some basics on databases might see another problem with this approach.
In case of complex WHERE clauses (hello SQL) or aggregations, you have to make sure that the required indices exist on the database.

	<p>Open source licenses are in the news again. Elastic recently <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changed the licensing for ElasticSearch and Kibana</a> from Apache 2.0 to a choice of <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Server Side Public License</a> (SSPL) or the non-open source Elastic license. Like most open source licensing changes, this one prompted a lot of discussion. Examples <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25776657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25833781" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> include some of the more printable comments.&nbsp;</p><p>But we’re not here to discuss Elastic’s business model or their choice of license(s).&nbsp; We’re here to discuss ClickHouse licensing and Altinity’s view of it. Here’s the executive summary.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ClickHouse is Apache 2.0.&nbsp; Altinity is committed to ensuring it stays that way.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Our contributions to ClickHouse are<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Apache 2.0</a>. Our ecosystem projects like the ClickHouse Kubernetes operator are likewise Apache 2.0. We believe the Apache 2.0 license is best for our users. It’s also the best way to make ClickHouse the most popular SQL data warehouse on the planet. There are several reasons for our outlook.&nbsp;</p><p>The most important feature of Apache 2.0 is that it allows use for any purpose, which is the first of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four essential freedoms</a> of open source software. Such freedom is important for all applications, regardless of whether they run on-prem or as cloud services. Apache 2.0 opens the door to imaginative new services as well as creative paths to develop them. Installed&nbsp;applications morph into online services. Services that hide data behind APIs morph into open data. This freedom is key to enabling innovative new ways to incorporate analytics into applications, which in turn unlocks new business opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>Apache 2.0 is also a great license for contributors.&nbsp; It has been around since 2004, which is a long time in open source. Corporate legal departments understand it and can easily approve contributions from employees. Individual contributors understand the freedom Apache 2.0 confers to publish their work and use it freely in future. It’s a win-win: companies are motivated to make investment decisions in open source projects, and contributors are motivated to implement them.&nbsp;</p><p>Apache 2.0 licensing opens a path to increasing ClickHouse capabilities and worldwide use. More important, it is enabling a flood of innovation in analytic applications. In a crowded market with many database products besides ClickHouse, that’s a critical competitive advantage.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 id="h-apache-2-0-creates-a-level-playing-field">Apache 2.0 creates a level playing field</h2>
</p><p>Since the ClickHouse Apache 2.0 license places no restriction on business use, we can expect many competing services that leverage ClickHouse in one way or another.&nbsp; This includes hosted ClickHouse and value-added analytic services built on top of ClickHouse capabilities. It also extends to add-ons for countless existing services ranging from web analytics to network flow log management to financial asset valuation and everything in between.</p><p>The competition will be distressing for unprepared vendors, but it’s great for users. Competing services mean that users have alternatives. It also means that innovation is not random but focused on things that users care about: SQL features, performance, security, cost-efficiency, and time to market.&nbsp;</p><p>The same vendors that offer ClickHouse managed services have contributed popular features to ClickHouse like <a href="https://altinity.com/blog/clickhouse-and-s3-compatible-object-storage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S3 storage integration</a>, <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/operations/access-rights/#role-management" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Role-based Access Control</a>, <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/select/with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Common Table Expressions</a>, and many more. ClickHouse is experiencing the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coopetition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-opetition</a> feedback effect that helped fuel the success of Linux, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, and other open source projects.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 id="h-restrictive-licenses-like-sspl-are-antithetical-to-user-interests">Restrictive licenses like SSPL are antithetical to user interests</h2>
</p><p>The Server Side Public License is an attempt to set back the clock on open source software development. It rules out new SaaS offerings based on projects whose value&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote>
<p>…entirely or primarily derives from the value of the Program or modified version, or offering a service that accomplishes for users the primary purpose of the Program or modified version.&nbsp; (SSPL Section 13).&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
</div><p>The goal of the SSPL and similar licenses is nothing short of setting up monopoly providers of SaaS offerings. It has ambiguous terms–creating uncertainty for potential competitors–and onerous viral requirements. Services that fall under Section 13 must release all source code required to run the entire SaaS offering. That includes everything from the service management plane down to deployment and backup scripts. SSPL is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">copyleft</a> with fangs.&nbsp;</p><p>This obviously affects vendors trying to set up competing services to the copyright holders of SSPL projects. But the effect on the market is far wider.&nbsp; Analytics are pervasive in modern applications and SaaS is the primary way that software is now distributed. The SSPL potentially harms any user building an application who just wants a managed offering to take care of running it. We believe that’s an unacceptable limitation.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 id="h-but-wait-what-about-amazon">But wait, what about Amazon?</h2>
</p><p>Many vendors have justified <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/mongodb-switches-up-its-open-source-license/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open source relicensing as a necessary defense</a> against “strip mining” from public clouds. Aren’t we afraid of this ourselves? If so, it’s a bit late. There are already multiple cloud services for ClickHouse, including our own offering, <a href="https://altinity.com/cloud-database/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Altinity.Cloud</a>. There’s also <a href="https://cloud.yandex.com/services/managed-clickhouse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yandex.Cloud</a> and at least three services in China. New entrants need to compete by adding additional value, <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/07/08/suse-acquires-rancher-labs-reported-600m-chases-1b-revenue-goal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just as Rancher did</a> in the Apache 2.0-licensed Kubernetes market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our goal at Altinity is to help customers bring high-value analytic applications to market quickly and operate them cost-effectively. We focus on development efficiency, data privacy, world-class support, and operations. We do so on all platforms, both public cloud and on-prem. Anybody who has worked on such services knows there’s opportunity here to build many valuable companies, not just one.&nbsp;</p><p>Other paths are possible. Vendors may fork ClickHouse and try to add licenses that create a proprietary fortress. If so, we would point to some friendly advice from a famous competitive analyst of the Italian Renaissance:&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote>
<p><em>So the best fortress that exists is to avoid being hated by the people. If you have fortresses and the people hate you, they will not save you</em>.</p>
<p><cite><em>Niccolo Machiavelli, The Prince</em></cite></p></blockquote>
</div><p>We don’t want to build new fortresses to protect ourselves against our users. We want to tear them down. Apache 2.0 is the key to enabling a new generation of analytic applications based on ClickHouse. Altinity is all in.&nbsp;</p><p>P.S., If you are worried about ElasticSearch and Kibana switching licenses, this might be a nice time to look at alternatives. ClickHouse can store log data remarkably well. More on that in future articles.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>A close look at the psychology of wine, how marketing affects your perceptions, and why you’re paying too much for wine.</em></p>



<p>In 2002, four Wall Street businessmen sat down for dinner at the Balthazar in New York City. They ordered a Mouton Rothschild 1989 for the table.</p>



<p>The Balthazar menu lists this wine at $2,000. It’s not hard to see why. The Mouton Rothschild 1989 is an exceptional wine, produced from grapes grown on 205 acres near Pauillac, just northwest of Bordeaux. At the time the grapes were grown, the vineyard was owned by Philippine de Rothschild, a member of the infamous Rothschild family at the center of banking in Europe from the eighteenth century onward. According to the <a href="https://www.liz-palmer.com/wine-review-chateau-mouton-rothschild-1989/">tasting notes</a> of Liz Palmer, the noted wine critic, the Mouton Rothschild 1989 is “a lovely Pauillac that has reached its plateau of maturity; notably dark ruby in colour; It has an engaging cedar and tobacco bouquet with hints of mint; not much fruit concentration; the palate follows suit – is medium-bodied and continues the aromatic theme of cedar and tobacco; demonstrates great persistence; well-defined – ‘old school’.” At a tasting in 2018, Jane Anson, the Bordeaux correspondent for <em>Decanter </em>magazine, gave it 97 points out of a possible 100.</p>



<p>That was the wine they ordered.</p>



<p>But it wasn’t the wine they got.</p>



<p>Instead, their server brought them an $18 Pinot Noir.</p>



<p>There had been a mix-up. The staff had poured the two wines into two decanters and sent the wrong decanter to the table.</p>



<p>Five minutes later, the restaurant manager rushed to their table to explain what had happened.</p>



<p>How did they these businessmen react? With incredulity, that a restaurant could make such a costly mistake? That their dinner had been ruined?</p>



<p>Nope.</p>



<p>Though they suspected what they were drinking wasn’t the wine they had ordered, they didn’t realize they were drinking an $18 Pinot Noir.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, a few tables away, the beneficiaries of the mistake—a couple who ordered the $18 Pinot Noir—didn’t realize it, either. In fact, as they unknowingly drank the $2,000 Mouton Rothschild 1989 they “jokingly pretended to be drinking an expensive wine.”<span id="easy-footnote-1-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-65224613" title="Mercer, C. (2020) NY restaurant couple mistakenly served $2000 Mouton 1989 after ordering $18 Pinot. <em>Decanter</em>. October 22, 2020."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>



<p>How could this have happened?</p>



<p>Not the mistake in the kitchen: the swapped decanters, the wrong wine at the wrong tables.</p>



<p>The real mistake was a mistake in perception: that an $18 Pinot Noir and a $2,000 Mouton Rothschild 1989 could be confused in the first place.</p>



<p>In today’s post, we’re going to take a deep dive into the world of expensive wine. We’ll see if expensive wine really tastes better or if the mix-up at the Balthazar was a one-off mistake. We’ll explore the ways price signals quality. We’ll look at how expectations influence perceptions. And we’ll finish with a definitive guide to buying great wine.</p>



<p>Sometimes you can answer a question with a statement supported by data, science, and story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer to the question—<em>does expensive wine really taste better?</em>—is not such an answer. Instead, this answer is a series of layers, each one more complicated than the last, and each one introducing a new set of questions—and a new set of revelations about taste, status, and perception.</p>



<h2>People can’t tell the difference between expensive wine and cheap wine</h2>



<p>When people don’t know the price, they like cheap wine just as much as expensive wine.&nbsp;Between April 2007 and February 2008, Robin Goldstein and his colleagues conducted 6,175 blind tests with 506 participants tasting 523 wines that ranged in price from $1.65 to $150.00 per bottle. About 12% of the participants had taken a sommelier course or had some kind of training. The test was double-blind: neither the person drinking the wine nor the person serving the wine knew the price. After each taste, participants rated it either “Bad,” Okay,” “Good,” or “Great.” Goldstein found that, on the whole, people actually gave <em>higher </em>ratings for cheap wine than expensive wine. However, compared to non-experts, the experts rated expensive wine more favorably. It seems that everyone likes cheap wine more than expensive wine, though experts are better at rating expensive wines compared to non-experts.<span id="easy-footnote-2-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-65224613" title="Goldstein, R., Almenberg, J., Dreber, A., Emerson, J. W., Herschkowitsch, A., &amp;amp; Katz, J. (2008). Do more expensive wines taste better? Evidence from a large sample of blind tastings. <em>Journal of Wine Economics</em>, 3(1), 1-9."><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Other blind tastings have produced the same results. In 2011, Johan Almenberg and Anna Dreber of the Stockholm School of Economics had 135 people rate a $40 wine and 131 people rate a $5 wine, both on a scale of 1 to 100. They split the tasters into three groups:</p>



<ol><li>Some people learned the price <em>before </em>they tasted it.&nbsp;</li><li>Others learned the price <em>after </em>they tasted it, but before they rated it.&nbsp;</li><li>And a third group did a blind tasting: they never learned the price and only tasted and rated the wine.</li></ol>



<p>Of this third group, people rated the cheap wine a 60.0 and the expensive wine a 58.5. To them, the $5 wine tasted better than the $40 wine!<span id="easy-footnote-3-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-65224613" title="Almenberg, J., &amp;amp; Dreber, A. (2011).

<p>For many people, a $40 wine sounds expensive. But for others, such as sommeliers, wine critics, and others, a $40 wine is still well below the threshold of what a great wine should cost. What if we compare a $40 wine (expensive to some, but cheap to others) to a $400 or $4,000 wine? In 2013, Vanessa Harrar and her colleagues conducted a blind tasting of seven sparkling wines, including six Champagnes. There were fifteen tasters, including four who considered themselves experts and five who considered themselves novices. This tasting, too, revealed no correlation between price and rating. Cheap Champagnes taste better than expensive Champagnes. In fact, of the wines sampled, the lowest rating was a Perrier-Jouët Belle Epoque Blanc de Blanc 2002, priced at £400; while the highest rated wines were a Mumm Vintage 2004 (£40) and a Perrier-Jouet Belle Epoque 2004 (£100). It seems that not only do cheap wines taste the same as expensive wines, but expensive wines taste the same as <em>very</em> expensive wines, too. <span id="easy-footnote-4-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-65224613" title="Harrar, V., Smith, B., Deroy, O. et al. Grape expectations: how the proportion of white grape in Champagne affects the ratings of experts and social drinkers in a blind tasting. <em>Flavour </em>2, 25 (2013)."><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Follow-up studies confirmed this. The next year, Robert H. Ashton published the results of his tasting session in the <em>Journal of Wine Economics</em>. In his study, 48 people, all members of a wine appreciation club at Duke University, tasted six wines each. They rated each wine on a scale of 1 to 10. As before, people thought the cheaper wines tasted better. In fact, in one of the tastings, the most expensive wine (a $119 bottle) was ranked a 3.70 and the cheapest wine (a $22 bottle) was ranked a 4.00.<span id="easy-footnote-5-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-65224613" title="Ashton, R.

<p>These and numerous other studies point in the same direction: in blind taste tests, people can’t distinguish cheap wine from expensive wine.</p>



<h2>People can’t tell the difference between two wines</h2>



<p>There’s a deeper issue, though. The real reason people can’t distinguish expensive wine from cheap wine is because they can’t distinguish <em>any </em>wine from <em>any other</em> wine—at least at rates that are no better than chance. In a series of two tastings, Roman Weil, the former co-chairman of the Oenonomy Society of the US, poured two wines into four glasses: one wine split between two glasses and the other wine split between the other two glasses. Then, he took one of the four glasses away, and served the remaining three glasses in the tasting. Thus, two of the three glasses were poured from the same bottle, and one of the three glasses from its own bottle. (If this is getting confusing, scroll down to the image.) Weil asked people to identify which two were the same and which one was different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How did people do?</p>



<p>Not great.</p>



<p>In the first tasting, people identified the wines from the same vintage only 41.5% of the time. That’s not very good when you consider that people would correctly pick the two wines from the same bottle 33.3% of the time if they made decisions at random: there are three glasses, so picking the two of three glasses at random would be correct 1 in 3 times. <span id="easy-footnote-6-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-65224613" title="Weil, R.L. (2001). Parker v. Prial: The death of the vintage chart. <em>Chance</em>, 14, 27–3"><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Weil’s second tasting produced similar results. This time, Weil had 395 people compare 855 pairs of regular wines and reserve wines, which are usually produced from superior grapes. People correctly identified only 346 of the 855 pairs, or roughly 40.5% of pairs, compared to the 33.3% that would be expected from random chance. Then, in a final step, Weil asked the 346 people who got it right to tell him which wine was the regular wine, and which wine was the reserve—the purportedly better wine.

<p>Weil’s studies show that people can tell two wines apart at rates that are barely better than chance (1 in 3) , and when they can, they pick the better wine at rates equal to chance (1 in 2).</p>



<p>Wine is an acquired taste. It takes time, training, and practice to tell good wine from bad (which could, itself, be evidence that great wine isn’t objectively great, though I digress). Perhaps expert tasters would perform better?</p>



<p>Unfortunately not. Professionals don’t do any better than novices: even people who are trained to taste, describe, and recommend wine for a living—and whose recommendations carry enormous weight within the industry and beyond—can’t tell one wine from another in a blind test. One of the first studies to reveal these inconsistencies took place at the wine competition of the California State Fair between 2005 and 2008. The competition is the oldest in the United States, and its judges include, “winemakers, wine buyers, wine critics and professors of enology and viticulture,” according to Robert T. Hodgson, the retired statistics professor and 35-year owner of the Fieldbrook Winery in California who conducted the study. Wineries are happy to pay more than $1 million collectively in entry fees to have their wine judged at the fair, since a gold medal awarded by judges at the fair can propel an unknown wine to the top of the market.<span id="easy-footnote-8-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-8-65224613" title="Hodgson, R.T.

<p>Typically, judges at the state fair taste between four and six flights of wine per day, and each flight contains 30 wines. However, Hodgson served them a second flight that contained …</p></div></article></div>

Typically we assume that if we get more things done each day, we’re highly productive. But the assumption couldn’t be more wrong.</p><p>Productivity is not about getting all things done, it’s about getting the most important things done, those with the most impact to reach your goals.</p><p>When we think of someone productive, a friend or colleague, we tend to picture someone “busy” pushing through those tasks ticking them off one by one, trapped under an ever-growing pile of work. </p><p>It’s easy to think that busy people with a lot of output are productive, but the actual work they produce might be of little use. Being busy with many tasks, work-responsibilities, and long working hours does not mean that you are productive.</p><p>To become more productive, focus on the tasks that bring you closer to your goals, and consistently do so. Not everything is essential. No matter what you’re working on, there are tasks that you shouldn’t do or delegate, and only a few that are truly important.</p><p><strong>James Clear</strong>, the author of bestseller Atomic Habits, puts it in this way:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span> “Being productive is about maintaining a steady, average speed on a few things, not maximum on everything.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p><strong>Darius Foroux</strong>, author and productivity guru, says:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>“Productivity is when you focus on relevant output, getting the right things done. Things that improve your career, business, organization.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="what-does-productivity-mean-to-you">What does productivity mean to you?</h2><p>Before you put your head down and start thinking about becoming more productive, think about “why” you have this urge, what’s driving you. A standard answer that you might think of is; having more free time to do the things you enjoy doing. </p><p>If you can do more with less, surely you can reach your goals sooner, leaving you with time to focus on other goals in life. Is it a career goal you have, more time to read books, more time with your family or friends? Having clarity around what’s driving your actions will help you when things get tough.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-increasing-personal-productivity">What are the benefits of increasing personal productivity?</h2><p>We all have 24 hours in a day, it’s up to each of us to determine how we want to use those hours. Productive people get more done with less effort, allowing them to focus on what was driving them in the first place. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>There are clear benefits of improving your personal productivity, focus on the tasks with the most impact, the right things, and you’ll achieve more, and get better results.</p><p>Other benefits can be:</p><ol><li><strong>Reduce Stress</strong><br>When you become more organized and start to achieve your most impactful tasks on time, you will feel less stressed. Instead of running around trying to accomplish everything, you can focus on what matters the most. Your personal well-being increases, e.g., you feel happy and comfortable.</li><li><strong>Increase Engagement</strong><br>Increased productivity and engagement are closely related to each other. More productive people are usually also more passionate and engaged in the work they do. <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/07/employee-engagement-does-more">Harvard Business Review</a> pointed out that higher engagement leads to a 22% increase in productivity. </li><li><strong>Improve self-confidence</strong><br>Improving productivity also allows you to learn more in less time. And, when you get better at what you do, you’ll also increase your confidence. In other words, productive people will learn more, get better at what they do, and become more self-confident.</li></ol><h2 id="how-to-become-more-productive">How to become more productive</h2><p>As highlighted earlier in this article, it’s a significant difference between “movement” and “achievement.” Checking off tasks will allow you to feel more accomplished, but it won’t ensure that you move closer to your goals. Whatever strategy or technique you go with, and there are plenty to choose from, the most important thing to remember is to go with the one you feel most comfortable with.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Like everything else in life, to make a change, it requires time and focus. So you need to look for a strategy that you can stick with and create a habit around.</p><p>To get you started, <strong>here are some of the most common and practical productivity strategies:</strong></p><h2 id="the-pomodoro-method">The Pomodoro Method</h2><p>Perhaps one of the most known and researched methods out there, and for a good reason, it’s simple and it works. This method can help you keep focus by getting things done in shorter bursts. </p><p>In-between, you take frequent breaks that can either be short or long, depending on how many tasks you’ve completed. You don’t need any particular tools to get started, all you need is a timer. In short, here’s how it works:</p><ul><li>Start on a task that you want to accomplish</li><li>Set the timer on 25 minutes (This block is referred to as the “Pomodoro”)</li><li>Work on the task until the timer rings, put a checkmark on a paper</li><li>Take a 5-minutes break</li><li>After completing 4 “Pomodoros” take a 15-20 minutes break</li></ul><p>The main idea behind this popular technique is that the timer creates a sense of urgency, allowing you to keep focused and not give in to distractions. <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-pomodoro-technique-boost-your-productivity/">Learn more about the Pomodoro Method.</a> </p><h2 id="eat-that-frog-method">Eat That Frog Method</h2><p>Mark Twain once said, “Eat a live frog first thing in the morning, and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.” Applied to the real world, the “frog” would symbolize the most impactful and essential task you have to complete on a given day, week, or month. </p><p>If you eat that frog in the morning, or when you are the most productive, then you’ll get more done. <a href="https://blog.doit.io/eat-that-frog/">Learn more about the Eat that Frog method.</a></p><h2 id="the-eisenhower-matrix">The Eisenhower Matrix</h2><p>Former President and five-star general, Dwight Eisenhower, had an extraordinary capability of being productive for more extended periods. One of his most essential productivity strategies is called the Eisenhower Matrix (or Box), and it’s a simple decision-making tool that you can easily incorporate in your daily routines. </p><p>The matrix labels tasks, depending on their level of importance and urgency. Learn more about <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-eisenhower-matrix/">how to use the Eisenhower Matrix in this article.</a></p><h2 id="focus-on-one-thing">Focus on ONE thing</h2><p>A productive person doesn’t necessarily do more work, they focus their work on the right things. And If you then focus your energy on “one” right thing after the other, you’ll accomplish more, and you’re likely to achieve your goals quicker. </p><p>This is, however, not just about focusing on one thing in your life period. It’s about being critical of what you choose to focus your energy on, where you have the most impact, and eliminate waste. Hone in on what matters and let go of everything else. This technique is not as simple as it may sound, but if you learn to master it, you can achieve almost anything. Learn more about <a href="https://blog.doit.io/focus-on-one-thing-leads-to-better-work/">how focusing on one thing can help you.</a></p><h2 id="the-ivy-lee-method">The Ivy Lee Method</h2><p>This 100-years old, 15-minutes method has been used by many professionals to increase their productivity. Why does it work? It’s dead simple. Here’s how it works:</p><ul><li>At the end of each day, write down the six most important tasks that you need to complete the following day. Not more than six.</li><li>Prioritize and stack rank these tasks in order of importance</li><li>Next day, start with your most important task and don’t more to the next task until you’ve completed the first one.</li><li>Work through the list of the tasks in the prioritized order. If you have unfinished tasks from one day, move them over to the new list next for the next day.</li><li>Every day you rinse and repeat this process. <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-ivy-lee-method/">Learn more about The Ivy Lee method, and how it can help you. </a></li></ul><h2 id="the-15-minute-anthony-trollope-routine">The 15-Minute Anthony Trollope Routine</h2><div><p>How did Anthony Trollope, a prolific English novelist and civil servant of the Victorian era, manage to write 47 novels, an autobiography, 2 plays, short stories, travel books, and countless of articles? </p><p>How can you possibly do all that while also maintaining a career at the Post Office as well?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>Of course</strong> we want type safety when programming Factorio mods. Unfortunately, Factorio's Lua modding API offers no such provisions. Good news! <a href="https://github.com/cdaringe/factorio-type-kit">factorio-type-kit</a> helps bridge that gap via TypeScript. While TypeScript doesn't offer
the strongest safety guarantees of any language under the sun, it does offer moderate safety, and works well
as a Lua replacement. The following steps are required to author factorio mods in TS:</p>
<h2>Factorio in TypeScript - Outline</h2>
<p>We will execute the following steps later, but at a glance, here are the general required steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/">node</a>. I recommend using <a href="https://github.com/Schniz/fnm#using-a-script-macoslinux">fnm</a> for installing and managing nodejs installations.</li>
<li>(optional) Install <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install">yarn</a>. <code>npm</code> is the default package manager for nodejs, but the following document uses <code>yarn</code>. It takes only moments to install.</li>
<li>Setup a <code>nodejs</code> project</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://github.com/cdaringe/factorio-type-kit">factorio-type-kit</a>, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/#installation">typescript</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/TypeScriptToLua/TypeScriptToLua">TypeScriptToLua</a></li>
<li>Configure the typescript compiler to use TypeScriptToLua</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Package &amp; deploy the mod</li>
</ol>
<p>It is assumed that the reader has installed node &amp; yarn before proceeding further.</p>
<p>Let's get to work.</p>
<h2>Bootstrapping a barebones mod</h2>
<p>The following command can be run to bootstrap a fresh mod project <em>automatically</em>:</p>
<!-- <Shell children='$ yarn create factorio-mod <mod-name>' /> -->
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn create factorio-mod &lt;mod-name&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>For demonstration purposes, I will create a mod called <code>vroom</code>. This mod will make the character accelerate as he runs, allowing the player to travel at warp speed!</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn create factorio-mod vroom</span>
...
Victory! Your mod is ready to roll. Execute the following commands to get going:
  - cd "/Users/cdaringe/src/vroom"
  - yarn start
✨  Done in 5.75s.</code></pre>
<p>This step automatically installs the aforementioned dependencies and sets up the compiler toolchain.
If you want to do these steps manually, please see the <a href="https://github.com/cdaringe/vroom">vroom</a> codebase, and replicate the artifacts hosted there. <a href="https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vroom">@mods.factorio.com</a></p>
<h2>Understanding the barebones mod</h2>
<p>Let us <code>cd "path/to/vroom"</code>, and study the content. If you
are familiar with the <a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/Tutorial:Mod_structure">factorio mod directory stucture</a>,
this should look quite familiar.</p>

<li><code>info.json</code> - the entrypont to all factorio mods, pre-populated with some essentials</li>
<li><code>control.ts</code> - this file will compile to <code>control.lua</code>, which Factorio uses to run your mod!</li>
<li><code>tsconfig.json</code> - typescript configuration, critically including <a href="https://typescripttolua.github.io/docs/configuration">TypescriptToLua configuration</a></li>
<li><code>package.json</code> &amp; <code>node_modules</code> - resources to support your TS development experience :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's open up <code>control.ts</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onTick = <span>(<span>_evt: OnTickPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  game.print(serpent.block({
    <span>hello</span>: <span>"world"</span>,
    <span>its_nice</span>: <span>"to see you"</span>
  }));
};

script.on_event(defines.events.on_tick, onTick);</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>script.on_event</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>game</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>serpent</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>evt</code> - typed, via casting</li>
</ul>
<p>Boom! Types for everything!</p>
<p>...but not quite. The Factorio Lua documentation is <em>lossy</em>, and has many cases where we simply <em>cannot</em> parse correct type definitions from the Factorio website. Until the factorio development team publicly supports  machine-readable API documentation, <code>factorio-type-kit</code> TypeScript provisions will generally only be 70-80%+ complete. Thus, TypeScript users will be periodically disappointed to find <code>any</code> or <code>unknown</code> types in various interfaces. With that said, <code>factorio-type-kit</code> users are welcome to manually backfill essential definitions to make our community's development kit better.</p>
<h2>Starting the mod compiler</h2>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn start</span></code></pre>
<p>Momentarily after launching the watching compiler, <code>control.lua</code> should be emitted. Open it up:</p>
<pre><code>onTick = <span><span>function</span><span>(_evt)</span></span>
    game.<span>print</span>(
        serpent.block({hello = <span>"world"</span>, its_nice = <span>"to see you"</span>})
    )
<span>end</span>
script.on_event(defines.events.on_tick, onTick)</code></pre>
<p>The TypeScriptToLua compiler does a fanstastic job on producing readable Lua.</p>
<h2>Implementing vroom</h2>
<p>The very first thing the <code>vroom</code> mod needs to do is detect when the player is in motion.</p>
<p>Rather that pull up the documentation, I'll just open up another call <code>script.on_event</code>, then
begin typing in <code>defines.events.</code>. After intellisense presents me options, I will select <code>on_player_changed_position</code>. The type definitions tell me a callback is also required. I will enter in <code>onPositionChanged</code>.</p>
<pre><code>script.on_event(
  defines.events.on_player_changed_position,
  onPositionChange
);</code></pre>
<p><code>onPositionChange</code> is not defined yet. Let's discuss what it needs to do then draft it.
First, it needs to get the player's current speed. Next, the speed needs to increase when running. Because the purpose of the mod is to accelerate the user, we multiply the previous speed by a scalar every so often.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onPositionChange = <span>(<span>evt: OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>const</span> player = game.get_player(evt.player_index);
  <span>if</span> (player.walking_state.walking) {
    
  }
};</code></pre>
<p>Immediately take note that we have manually specified the type of <code>evt</code> as <code>OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</code>. All factorio script event types follow the event naming convention: <code>&lt;CamelCased-EventName&gt;Payload</code>. A future version may automatically apply types to the <code>on_event</code> callback, so you not need cast.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed was that <code>evt</code> did not have a reference directly to the player I needed.
It does contain the <code>player_id</code> however, and with that ID we can call the <code>get_player</code> method on the global <code>game</code> instance. <code>get_player</code> returns an instance of a <code>LuaPlayer</code>, contains a <code>walking_state</code> property. Let's use <em>that</em>. We know that we <em>only</em> want to speed up the player if he is in motion, so let's further wrap our logic inside a conditional--<code>if (player.walking_state.walking) { ... }</code>.</p>
<p>Next up, how do we actually speed up the player? After searching the API documentation, I concluded that there was not a direct value specifying a velocity of the character. However, I did come across <code>character_running_speed_modifier</code>, which the type definitions told me is of type <code>number</code>. Unexpectedly, through trial and error, I learned that <code>character_running_speed_modifier</code> could be zero. <code>Speed * 0 = 0</code>, so Factorio likely does a 0 check internally before calculating the player's speed. We will have to do a similar check. Notice that typescript did not me help uncover my bug! Anything of type <code>number</code> can rightfully be zero, so shame on me! Defensive programmers everywhere are saying "you should have seen this coming", and they would be correct :). Equipped with this knowledge, let's fill in the rest.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onPositionChange = <span>(<span>evt: OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>const</span> player = game.get_player(evt.player_index);
  <span>if</span> (player.walking_state.walking) {
    <span>const</span> lastSpeed = player.character_running_speed_modifier;
    <span>const</span> baseSpeed = lastSpeed == <span>0</span> ? <span>1</span> : lastSpeed;
    player.character_running_speed_modifier = baseSpeed * <span>1.01</span>;
  }
};</code></pre>
<p>When our player stops running, we want to restart the acceleration process for the next time he runs.
My original approach was to listen for <code>keyup</code> events. Alas, Factorio has no key events. How else could I determine if the player has stopped running, and thus safely reset the speed modifier? Easy! On every tick of the game, I can check all players for motion--and turn off the multiplier if they are stopped!</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onTick = <span>(<span>_evt: OnTickPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>Object</span>.entries(game.players).forEach(<span>(<span>[_id, player]</span>) =&gt;</span> {
    <span>if</span> (
      player.character_running_speed_modifier &gt; <span>0</span> &amp;&amp;
      !player.walking_state.walking
    ) {
      player.character_running_speed_modifier = <span>0</span>;
    }
  });
};</code></pre>
<p>That is, for every player, if there is a positive speed modifier and and the player is not walking, zero out the modifier.</p>
<p>Why didn't we just do a <code>game.players.forEach</code>? <code>game.players</code> isn't an array, so that won't work. TypeScript protected us from making that mistake! What about <code>Object.entries(game.players).forEach</code>? Yep, that worked! Why did we not do <code>Object.values(...)</code>? Because <code>game.players</code> is a <a href="https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/LuaGameScript.html#LuaGameScript.players">special dictionary</a> in Lua. Not all iterables map cleanly between languages. <code>Object.values(...)</code> wouldn't have given us compiler error, but still would have failed. Improved typing is needed to protect against these failures. While TypeScriptToLua generally helps out a great deal protect us from writing erroneous code, it is only as good as its applied type constraints.</p>
<p>When using JS standard library provisions, as we did above, the compiler will add a typescript-lua polyfill, <code>lualib_bundle</code>. The emitted Lua perhaps is not as elegant:</p>
<pre><code><span>require</span>(<span>"lualib_bundle"</span>);

onTick = <span><span>function</span><span>(_evt)</span></span>
    __TS__ArrayForEach(
        __TS__ObjectEntries(game.players),
        <span><span>function</span><span>(____, ____bindingPattern0)</span></span>
            <span>local</span> _id = ____bindingPattern0[<span>1</span>]
            <span>local</span> player
            player = ____bindingPattern0[<span>2</span>]
            <span>if</span> (player.character_running_speed_modifier &gt; <span>0</span>) <span>and</span> (<span>not</span> player.walking_state.walking) <span>then</span>
                player.character_running_speed_modifier = <span>0</span>
            <span>end</span>
        <span>end</span>
    )
<span>end</span></code></pre>
<p>Even with the extra boilerplate generated, the code is still quite readable. Could be cleaner! Surely as the TypeScriptToLua compiler evolves in time, it will be.</p>
<h2>Deploy it</h2>
<p>I do not yet have clean, polished package &amp; deploy scripts, but I do have functional ones.
Do your best to cover your eyes. Running <code>yarn install_mod</code> syncs the mod into the local Factorio installation. Coupled with a watch script, every code change immediately syncs in the game folder, and requires only a scenario reload to exercise the new scripts.</p>
<pre><code>"scripts": {
  "clean:install": "rm -rf ~/Library/Application\\ Support/factorio/mods/vroom*",
  "copy:install": "VERSION=$(cat info.json | jq -r .version) &amp;&amp; rsync -r --exclude node_modules --exclude '.git*' --exclude build --exclude 'npm*' --exclude README.md --exclude package.json --exclude '*.lock'  ./ ~/Library/Application\\ Support/factorio/mods/vroom_$VERSION/",

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As I was sitting at work, coming up with a way to solve some synchronization issue between our relational database and a search index, it got me thinking… Is it possible to have a database that can handle this stuff for me, the way, for example, Postgres handles the creation and maintenance of an index? Just one <strong>CREATE INDEX</strong> away from efficient and fast queries. What about a database that can serve every need: storing and reading data effectively, scaling smoothly as the workload increases, being able to run complex searches, do batch and stream processing for analytical purposes and work with every other access pattern we can imagine.</p><p>Almost any organization that handles data uses a relational database in its stack. It makes sense, it’s a battle-tested technology that stood the test of time. For a large percent of the applications, the need won’t arise for a different kind of data system. Take Postgres for example: it’s highly scalable, it has transactions with ACID properties, materialized views, supports partitioning and replication, joins, views, triggers, stored procedures, hot backups, all that kind of stuff. We can go
along way with it without having to worry about problems with the dataflow in our system. But of course, not all data models are suitable for Postgres, and even though it supports things like full-text searches and JSON columns, some times it is more suitable or easier even, to use different technology.</p><p>But even though relational databases have come a very long way, still they are not designed to handle every possible workload, so we resort to having to combine multiple systems to handle this broad variety: we use Redis for caching, Elasticsearch for searching, Kafka for stream processing, and many more similar tools and technologies, each of them serving a very narrow purpose in handling our different use cases.</p><p>But is there a way to unify the interface across these systems?</p><p>These technologies are great at what they do, we just need something that nicely ties them together instead of putting that burden on our applications. Putting the application in this role is too much of a responsibility, storing and transporting the data from one place to another as well as handling all of the business logic is a sure way of making those systems permanently inconsistent with each other.</p><p>Instead, if we can figure out a way of making these diverse components work nicely together, we will have a much more reliable solution. Kinda like the pipe in Unix, allowing the user to compose different workflows together out of simpler programs, by sending the output of one command to another, for further processing.</p><p>Now I know there are tools today that handle some of these cases that I mentioned, and they are getting better each day, but they’re far from simple to operate and maintain, and more importantly, they’re not of declarative nature.</p><p>Instead of relying on tools, is it possible to have some abstraction akin to SQL, some declarative language that will hide away the complexities of storing and synchronizing the data across the different data systems, making it easier to combine the disparate technologies, while also providing escape hatches in case the need arises to access the underlying storage directly?</p><p>Taking inspiration from the UNIX philosophy which emphasizes building complex systems out of simpler, extensible, and modular components, can we apply the same principles here, to our future data systems?</p></div></div>]]>

                            For many children of the '80s, a good portion of your childhood probably revolved around sitting too close to the TV, clutching a plastic safety cone-colored hand gun and blasting waterfowl out of a pixilated sky in <em>Duck Hunt </em>(also, trying to blow that dog’s head off when he laughed at you). The <em>Duck Hunt</em> gun, officially called the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Zapper, seems downright primitive next to the Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s Kinect, but in the late 80s, it filled plenty of young heads with wonder. How did that thing work?
                        
</p><h4>Annie Get Your Zapper</h4><p>
    
                            The Zapper’s ancestry goes back to the mid 1930s, when the first so-called “light guns” appeared after the development of light-sensing vacuum tubes. In the first light gun game, <a href="http://www.pinrepair.com/arcade/rayolit.htm">Ray-O-Lite</a> (developed in 1936 by Seeburg, a company that made parts and systems for jukeboxes), players shot at small moving targets mounted with light sensors using a gun that emitted a beam of light. When the beam struck a sensor, the targets – ducks, coincidentally – registered the “hit” and a point was scored.
                        
</p><p>
    
                            Light guns hit home video game consoles with <em>Shooting Gallery</em> on the Magnavox Odyssey in 1972. Because the included shotgun-style light gun was only usable on a Magnavox television, the game flopped. The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Zapper then fell into the hands of American kids in October 1985, when it was released in a bundle with the NES, a controller and a few games. Early versions of the peripheral were dark gray, but the color of the sci-fi ray gun-inspired Zapper was changed a few years later when a federal regulation required that toy and imitation firearms be “blaze orange” (color #12199, to be exact) so they wouldn’t be mistaken for the real deal.
                        
</p><p>
    
                            While there were a number of Zapper-compatible games released for the NES (when I was a kid and my dad worked from home, we wasted plenty of afternoons away playing <em>Hogan’s Alley</em>), most lived in the shadow of the iconic <em>Duck Hunt</em>, the most recognizable and popular Zapper game.
                        
</p><h4>Gone in a Flash</h4><p>
    
                            While older light guns like the Ray-O-Lite rifle emitted beams of light, the Zapper and many other recent light guns work by receiving light through a photodiode on or in the barrel and using that light to figure out where on the TV screen you're aiming.
                        
</p><p>
    
                            This target flashing method helped Nintendo overcome a weakness of older light gun games: cheaters racking up high scores by pointing the gun at a steady light source, like a lamp, and hitting the first target right out of the gate.

<p><span>March 17, 2014</span>
</p>
<p>Remember <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/" rel="nofollow">Galton’s experiments on visual imagination?</a> Some people just don’t have it. And they never figured it out. They assumed no one had it, and when people talked about being able to picture objects in their minds, they were speaking metaphorically.
</p>
<p>And the people who <em>did</em> have good visual imaginations didn’t catch them. The people without imaginations mastered this “metaphorical way of talking” so well that they passed for normal. No one figured it out until Galton sat everyone down together and said “Hey, can we be really really clear about exactly how literal we’re being here?” and everyone realized they were describing different experiences.
</p>
<p>I thought about this recently during a conversation with Ozy:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> I am currently eating chickpeas and rice and I am <em>delighted</em> by the fact that I can eat this <em>whenever I want</em>. The nice thing about DISCOVERING YOUR FOOD PREFERENCES is that suddenly all the food in my cupboards is food I like and am looking forward to eating. And usually I get food I like by, like, luck? So this is excitement.
</p>
<p><strong>Scott:</strong> I don’t understand, why didn’t you buy things like that before?
</p>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> It took me a while to have enough of a sense of the food I like for “make a list of the food I like” to be a viable grocery-list-making strategy.
</p>
<p><strong>Scott:</strong> I’ve got to admit I’m confused and intrigued by your “don’t know my own preferences” thing.
</p>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> Hrm. Well, it’s sort of like… you know how sometimes you pretend to like something because it’s high-status, and if you do it well enough you <em>actually believe</em> you like the thing? Unless I pay a lot of attention <em>all</em> my preferences end up being not “what I actually enjoy” but like “what is high status” or “what will keep people from getting angry at me”
</p>
<p><strong>Scott:</strong> How does that apply to food?
</p>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> Well, sometimes people will tell you a certain food is high-status or healthy or a thing that everyone enjoys, and then I would like it. And a lot of times I just ate whatever was in front of me or ordered whatever the cheapest vegetarian thing on the menu was. And I… sort of vaguely had a sense that some things were more pleasurable to eat than other things but I didn’t like <em>keep track</em> of what they were or anything. Because if I knew I might like the <em>wrong things</em>. And also because I didn’t intuitively grasp that the “liking” thing everyone was talking about was related to pleasure and not to like popularity/status.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So the fact that people talk about what foods they like about a zillion times a day isn’t enough to make everyone realize liking foods is a thing.
</p>
<p>But it gets worse. A high school friend posted on Facebook a link to <a href="http://www.quora.com/Graduate-School/Is-going-for-a-Ph-D-worth-it-if-Im-extremely-passionate-about-a-field-but-dont-really-want-to-spend-my-20s-poor-toiling-away-in-a-lab-and-living-in-a-city-that-I-dont-particularly-want-to-live-in/answer/Mark-Eichenlaub?srid=slK&amp;share=1" rel="nofollow">a really interesting answer on Quora</a>. It makes you log on, so I’ll copy the relevant part below:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have anosmia, which means I lack smell the way a blind person lacks sight. What’s surprising about this is that I didn’t even know it for the first half of my life.
</p>
<p>Each night I would tell my mom, “Dinner smells great!” I teased my sister about her stinky feet. I held my nose when I ate Brussels sprouts. In gardens, I bent down and took a whiff of the roses. I yelled “gross” when someone farted. I never thought twice about any of it for fourteen years.
</p>
<p>Then, in freshman English class, I had an assignment to write about the Garden of Eden using details from all five senses. Working on this one night, I sat in my room imagining a peach. I watched the juice ooze out as I squeezed at the soft fuzz. I felt the wet, sappy liquid drip from my fingers down onto my palm. As the mushy heart of the fruit compressed, I could hear it squishing, and when I took that first bite I could taste the little bit of tartness that followed the incredible sweet sensation flooding my mouth.
</p>
<p>But I had to write about smell, too, and I was stopped dead by the question of what a peach smelled like. Good. That was all I could come up with. I tried to think of other things. Garbage smelled bad. Perfume smelled good. Popcorn good. Poop bad. But how so? What was the difference? What were the nuances? In just a few minutes’ reflection I realized that, despite years of believing the contrary, I never had and never would smell a peach.
</p>
<p>All my behavior to that point indicated that I had smell. No one suspected I didn’t. For years I simply hadn’t known what it was that was supposed to be there. I just thought the way it was for me was how it was for everyone. It took the right stimulus before I finally discovered the gap.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So I guess you can just <em>not be able to smell</em> and not know it.
</p>
<p>This makes me wonder what universal human experiences I and my friends are missing out on without realizing it.
</p>
<p>I know one friend’s answer. He discovered he was color-blind sometime in his teens. This still surprises me. People are always taking Ishihara tests (those colorful dotted circles with numbers inside of them) and discovering they’re color blind. Going through life with everyone else saying “The light was red, but now it’s green” and thinking it was weird that they were making such a big deal about subtle variations in shades of brownish-gray, but it was probably one of those metaphors.
</p>
<p>As for me? I took a surprisingly long time to realize I was asexual. When I was a virgin, I figured sex was one of those things that seemed gross before you did it, and then you realized how great it was. Afterwards, I figured it was something that didn’t get good until you were skilled at it and had been in a relationship long enough to truly appreciate the other person. In retrospect, pretty much every aspect of male sexual culture is a counterargument to that theory, but I guess it’s just really hard for my brain to generate “you are a mental mutant” as a hypothesis.
</p>
<p>But even bigger than that, I think I might not have had emotions, at least not fully, for about five years as a teenager when I was on SSRIs. I even sort of noticed myself not having emotions, but dismissed that as an odd thing to happen and probably other people were just being really overexuberant about things. Later I learned emotional blunting is a commonly reported side effect of SSRIs and I was probably just really not experiencing emotions. When I came off them it took me several years to get used to having normal-intensity feelings again, but it wasn’t a sudden revelation, like “Wow, I was missing a fundamental human experience for the past several years!” Just a sense of things being different which was hard to cash out.
</p>
<p>As always, I wonder if a lot of what other people interpret through vague social things might be biological, or at least more <em>complicatedly</em> social. I can’t enjoy jazz music even a little – the best I can do is pick up something sort of like a beat and half-heartedly feel like maybe I could snap my fingers to it if I could build up the energy. My brother fell in love with jazz as soon as he heard it and is now a professional jazz musician who has dedicated his life to it. Are we listening to the same thing when we hear a jazz tune? Or am I like a guy who can’t smell trying to appreciate perfume?

	  <p>Introduction</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/photography/T/w/Two-Surfers-On-The-Beach/Two-Surfers-On-The-Beach-Ireland.html"><img alt="Two surfers on the beach" title="Two surfers on the beach" src="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/photography/photos/T/w/Two-Surfers-On-The-Beach-225x150.jpg" width="225" height="150"></a></p><p>
            This documentation presents the UNIX kernel I wrote
            in 1994-1995.  It's an almost complete implementation of the
            POSIX.1 standard (IEEE Std 1003.1-1988).  My main motivation
            was learning about operating systems design and
            architecture, kernel algorithms, resource allocation,
            process scheduling, memory management policies, etc.  The
            result is a new POSIX compliant UNIX kernel with many
            features real operating systems have: virtual memory, demand
            paging, protection, swapping, etc.  It is not perfect, it
            probably has bugs, but in time they will get fixed and the
            kernel will become more stable.  Since many high-quality
            free software packages are available on the Internet, coming
            especially from the GNU project, I have ported many of them
	    to my system, with the idea of getting real functionality.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  As of December 2007, Thix has been taken over by 
	  <a href="mailto:paulhulme@thix.eu">Paul Hulme</a>.  His work
       	  will be distributed through <a href="http://thix.eu/">thix.eu</a>.
          </p>

          <p>Status</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/photography/B/a/Batroun-Village-Club-Amphitheatre/Batroun-Village-Club-Amphitheatre-Lebanon.html"><img alt="Batroun Village Club Amphitheatre" title="Batroun Village Club Amphitheatre" src="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/photography/photos/B/a/Batroun-Village-Club-Amphitheatre-225x150.jpg" width="225" height="150"></a></p><p>
            The Thix Operating System is fully functional at this time.
            Many free software packages have been succesfully
            compiled/run under it, including development tools such as
            the GNU C/C++ Compiler suite.  However, there is no
            networking support and the only drivers available are for
            floppy disks, (E)IDE hard disks, printers, virtual
            terminals, mem, kmem and null.
          </p>
          <p>
            The format of the executable is still a.out which is very
            hard to maintain due to its so many variants.  Maybe I'll
            switch to ELF one day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thix has been developped under Linux with GCC.  Many thanks
            to all the people that made this possible.

          <p>
            December 2006, i.e. 10 years later...  Yeah, it's been
            <em>that</em> long since I touched this stuff.  I could
            never get Thix to work in VMware, not straight out of the
            box anyway, but now that I got a Mac and <a href="http://parallels.com/" rel="external-parallels" title="Parallels">Parallels</a> seems to handle it quite
            well (minor keyboard issues notwithstanding), I figured I'd
            put an image out there for people to play with.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have created 3 images that can be useful for a number of
            things (development, study, or plain curiosity).  The first
            one is a <a href="http://vmware.com/" rel="external-vmware" title="VMware">VMware</a> image with an old distribution of
            S.u.S.E Linux (circa 1996).  This distribution has the old
            versions of GCC and binutils required to compile Thix.  I've
            set up two accounts, <em>root</em> and <em>tudor</em>, both
            using the account name as the password.  The <em>tudor</em>
            account contains the sources for the kernel and all the tools
            that have been ported to Thix.  I tried getting the same Linux
            version to install in Parallels under Mac OS X (Tiger) as well
            as convert the VMware image to Parallels once installed, and
	    failed miserably in both cases, so for now development is under
	    VMware and testing under Parallels.
          </p>
          <p>
            The more exciting part though are the other two images, one
            which is a full installation of Thix complete with a rescue
            floppy disk.  These are raw images (the disk one corresponds
            to an IDE disk with C/H/S=163/16/63 geometry).  Unfortunately,
            I couldn't get Thix to work in VMware, so these images, as you
            can tell from the file extensions, are for Parallels.
          </p>

          <p>
            ... now back to the old stuff.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thix is distributed under the GNU Public Licence.  You can
            download the <a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/thix/download/src/thix-0.3.7.tar.gz"> Thix
            kernel sources</a> and the <a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/thix/download/src/tfs-0.2.1.tar.gz">sources of the fsck</a>
            utility, a great tool in repairing damaged Thix File
            Systems.  To get an idea of how Thix works, you can download
            the raw compressed image of a 3.5" bootable <a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/thix/download/demo/thix-demo.bin.gz">demo floppy</a>.
            Uncompress it with gunzip, dump it on a formatted 3.5"
            floppy and boot from it.  At the login prompt type
            <em>root</em> to enter as superuser or <em>guest</em> to log
            in as an ordinary user.  The <em>root</em> password is
            <em>root</em> and the <em>guest</em> password is
            <em>guest</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are curious and want to install the entire Thix
            distribution (including the GNU C compiler and the related
            utilities), just download the sources (you will need them
            anyway), and read the installation instructions in the
            INSTALL file.
          </p>
          <p>
            Basically, you will have to download the <a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/thix/download/dist/thix-install.bin.gz"> install floppy</a>
            and the packages in the distribution:

<p>One of the central challenges in data science (DS) and machine learning (ML) is
managing and maintaining data quality. As an ML engineer and  practitioner who
frequently constructs, cleans, explores, and models proprietary (i.e. non-benchmark)
datasets, "bad data" makes all the difference between accurate versus misleading
data visualizations, statistical inferences, and models. In this article I want
to hone in on three problems that are fairly unique to DS/ML practice when it comes to
dealing with tabular data in the Python ecosystem using <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a>,
which is one of the de facto tools for data manipulation in the DS/ML toolchain.</p>

<h3 id="Data-Integrity-Errors-Fail-Silently">Data Integrity Errors Fail Silently<a href="#Data-Integrity-Errors-Fail-Silently"> </a></h3>
</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>Tooling for type safety is improving in the Python ecosystem with the broad adoption
of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html">typing</a> module and
projects like <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a>, which eases the developer
experience for writing readable, reliable code.</p>
<p>However, for most DS/ML work, this isn't quite sufficient. This is because
logical data types don't always capture the statistical distributions of the
variables under study, which is a key thing to do when, for example, your data
distribution shifts as a result of a world-wide pandemic,
<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/11/1001563/covid-pandemic-broken-ai-machine-learning-amazon-retail-fraud-humans-in-the-loop/">causing ML models to break</a>
in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Having systems in place that fail early (and loudly 🔊) when the data distribution
is not what you assumed is one of the critical pieces to building reliable
production systems, and we need better tooling for this.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>Another important tool in the developer's arsenal is testing. There are many
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1617296279">books</a>, <a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests">articles</a>, and
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5357601/whats-the-difference-between-unit-tests-and-integration-tests">discussions</a>
available online about different types of testing techniques and how to put them
into practice. I won't dive deeply into it here, but in short, testing your code
makes it easier to change it and know when you've broken something while at the same time serving as
documentation.</p>
<p>Even in exploratory or research contexts, it's a good idea to write tests for your
code because it strengthens your confidence in the robustness of the insights that
you're taking away from your analysis.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>The challenge with testing software compounds when processing data for the
purpose of statistical analysis and modeling.</p>
<p>Consider a machine learning pipeline that creates a predictive model from
survey responses. The barriers to testing data and transformation code
tends to be much higher than the business logic that processes survey responses
and stores raw values in a database because the latter tends to be simpler
and more atomic by design.</p>
<p>By <em>atomic</em> ⚛ I mean that each piece of data that's filled out by respondents
and stored in the database can be tested in isolation without having to
analyze the aggregate statistical patterns across a larger sample of responses.
On the other hand, for my statistical analysis to make sense, the overall
integrity of the statistical distribution 📊 of the responses needs to be taken
into account.</p>

<h3 id="Technical-Debt:-No-Tests-==-Legacy-Code">Technical Debt: <code>No Tests == Legacy Code</code><a href="#Technical-Debt:-No-Tests-==-Legacy-Code"> </a></h3>
</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>Because the effort that goes into exploring, cleaning, and figuring out how to
test my dataset is so high, I'm discouraged from writing tests for my pipeline
code. As the famous software development quip goes:</p>
<blockquote><p>"legacy code is code without tests"</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael C. Feathers, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Robert-Martin/dp/0131177052">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>But you might think: "but when I put my code in production, surely I
– or one of my collaborators – will write tests then?". The thing is,
regardless of who writes those tests or when they're written, someone'll have to
do it at some point, so the sooner and more quickly you can climb
the technical debt mountain 🏔 the better!</p>
<p>In the rest of this post I'll try to convince you that statistical typing gives
us the tools we need to do just that.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>If you've used strong, statically-typed languages before, or the <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a>
static type checker with type-hinting in Python, you may have noticed that type definitions can
often catch nasty type-related bugs 🐞 that render certain kinds of unit tests unnecessary. Other
tools, like <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/">pydantic</a>, enforce types at runtime via a
data parsing model.</p>

<p>Statistical typing extends the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type">logical data types</a>
to the class of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_data_type">statistical data types</a>
and, ultimately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_probability_distributions">probability distributions</a>.
Statistical data types builds on top of logical data types, and in fact there's considerable overlap between the two.</p>
<p>For example, the <em>binary</em> logical data type is also a statistical data type. The key
difference is that statistical data types hold additional semantics that govern the kinds
of statistical operations that we can perform on variables of a particular type and
probability distributions that describe those variables.</p>

<div>
<p>What if you can specify the set of acceptable values that a variable can take,
from the data type, set/range of values, or even what distribution a particular
variable is drawn from? This is the goal of statistical typing: to enumerate a
practical set of constraints that specify what should be considered valid data for
a particular dataset.</p>
<p>For example, we might want a <em>categorical</em> variable to be drawn <em>somewhat</em> uniformly
from a set of values <code>{A, B, C}</code>. We can express this as a hypothesis test that
causes our pipeline to fail if any one of the values occurs significantly more
frequently than the others, given a pre-defined level of statistical significance.</p>
<p>Or we may want a <em>real-valued</em> variable to be drawn roughly from a normal
distribution with mean <code>µ</code> and variance <code>σ</code>, which can also be specified with an
alpha value that we deem acceptable for a particular analysis.</p>
<p>In essence, a statistical typing implementation involves specifying three kinds
of metadata for a given set of variables:</p>
<ol>
<li>logical data types, e.g. <code>int</code>, <code>str</code>, <code>float</code>, etc.</li>
<li>deterministic properties, e.g. <code>categorical</code> values and <code>real-valued</code> ranges</li>
<li>probabilistic properties, e.g. sufficient statistics like <code>mean</code> and <code>standard deviation</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The challenge presented by item <em>3</em> is obvious: discovering the underlying
probability distributions of real-world data is often non-trivial. However,
even if we can only express or automatically infer these metadata up to point
<em>2</em>, we can still get something quite powerful 💪: <strong>property-based testing of statistical
analysis code</strong>.</p>

<p>With a statistically-typed dataframe, not only can we validate real-world data to
ensure that our assumptions about them hold up, but we can also test our data
transformation, analysis, and modeling code <em>given valid samples</em> according to
our schema definition. Statistical typing effectively gives DS/ML practitioners
the tools to easily isolate their code from real-world data, providing a convenient
way of implementing unit tests.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>Let me illustrate how these concepts would work in practice with a toy problem using
<a href="https://github.com/pandera-dev/pandera">pandera</a>, a runtime data validation library
for <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas dataframes</a> that I've been developing over
the last few years.</p>
<p>Suppose you're building a predictive model of house prices given features about
different houses:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>In the raw data above you can see that we have the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>feature 1: <code>square_footage</code></li>
<li>feature 2: <code>n_bedrooms</code></li>
<li>feature 3: <code>property_type</code></li>
<li>target: <code>price</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Our modeling pipeline will involve two steps:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h3 id="Defining-Schemas-with-pandera">Defining Schemas with <code>pandera</code><a href="#Defining-Schemas-with-pandera"> </a></h3>
</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>At its core, <code>pandera</code> provides a flexible and expressive API for defining
dataframe schemas and seamlessly integrating data validation logic into your
data analysis pipelines, all while separating the concerns of data cleaning
and validation.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>In the code above, we can see that we're defining a <code>BaseSchema</code>, which shares
columns that are common between the raw and processed data. We're also making
sure that the columns are coerced to the expected data types during validation.</p>
<p><code>RawData</code> and <code>ProcessedData</code> inherit from <code>BaseSchema</code>, and just by looking
at them we can see the difference that we expect between the raw and processed data:
our <code>process_data</code> function should convert the <code>property_type</code> categorical
variable into a set of dummy variables.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h3 id="Runtime-Data-Testing">Runtime Data Testing<a href="#Runtime-Data-Testing"> </a></h3><p>Now we use python's type-hinting syntax to annotate the <code>process_data</code> and
<code>train_model</code> functions, decorating them with <code>@pa.check_types</code> to make sure
that the inputs and outputs are validated at runtime:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Now every time we run our pipeline our data is validated as it passes through
the various transformations:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>So if we pass invalid data into <code>run_pipeline</code>, we should get an error:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Here, <code>pandera</code> tells exactly what went wrong: the <code>property_type</code>
column has an invalid category <code>unknown</code> at the 0th entry.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h3 id="Property-based-Testing">Property-based Testing<a href="#Property-based-Testing"> </a></h3><p>But wait, there's more! Since we've already defined our schemas, we can isolate
the processing and model-training code from real-world data to test that
each component in your pipeline is functioning as expected.</p>
<p><code>pandera</code> builds on top of the <a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/">hypothesis</a>
package to generate synthetic data from search strategies that try to find
the simplest case that would falsify your tests:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>We could run this as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html">unittest</a>
or <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/">pytest</a> suite, but for now we can just run the
tests manually like so:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>So if we were to incorrectly implement any of the components in our pipeline,
we'd see errors early on. In this case, we're just going to return the raw data
without the dummified <code>property_type</code> variable.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Here, our test suite catches the fact that <code>property_type_condo</code> doesn't exist
in our processed data output.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>We can get some more intuition about what's going on with the data synthesis
strategies by interactively generating data using the <code>example</code> method.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Under the hood, <code>pandera</code> is collecting all of the schema properties and
converting it into a search strategy using the
<a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/numpy.html#pandas">pandas-supported hypothesis strategies</a>.
Currently, one limitation that you can see from the <code>ProcessedData</code> example above is that the
generated data doesn't quite capture the joint distribution between the <code>property_type_*</code> dummy
variables, as the second row contains <code>1</code>s for all of the property types. Depending on</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="articleBody"><p dir="ltr"> workers with a universal basic income did not reduce the amount of effort they put into their work, according to an experiment conducted by Spanish economists, a sign that the policy initiative could help mitigate inequalities and debunking a common criticism of the proposal.</p><p dir="ltr">Examining a universal basic income worth about one-fifth of workers' median wages, the researchers also found that the threat of being replaced by robots did not impact workersâ€™ productivity, nor did a tax on firms when they replace a worker with a robot or automated process, though the latter successfully created a disincentive for managers.</p><p dir="ltr">Their <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00676-8">research</a>, published last month in <em>Humanities and Social Sciences Communications</em>, utilized a behavioral economics lab set up by FundaciÃ³n COTEC, a nonprofit organization honorarily led by the king of Spain that promotes innovation as a driver of economic and social development. The foundation aimed to understand how automation and universal basic income may impact entrepreneurs, companies and the public sector.</p><p dir="ltr">Researchers recruited 900 individuals to take part in the experiment, 59% of whom were female and 98% of whom were university students. The average age was 21, with a minimum age of 19 and a maximum age of 30. Participants were asked to work on a set of tasks and were paid based on their performance. Researchers then introduced several different scenarios, such as replacing certain participants with robots and creating a universal basic income worth about one-fifth of the workersâ€™ median pay, to see how worker productivity was impacted.</p><p dir="ltr">Though it was a laboratory experiment, Angel SÃ¡nchez, a co-author of the research and professor at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, said the researchers wanted to ensure their findings would be applicable in real-world situations, so the money given to participants had to be earned.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œItâ€™s not like I just give you money and then you donâ€™t feel you should care much about what to do with it,â€� SÃ¡nchez said. â€œNo â€” you earned it and youâ€™re going to feel itâ€™s yours and you donâ€™t want to throw it away. And thatâ€™s key in the experiment because thatâ€™s what we think gives external validity to the experiment.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">The researchers also vetted their experiment with the FundaciÃ³n COTEC board of trustees, many of whom are part of Spainâ€™s largest companies, â€œand they think this experiment made perfect sense, of course as a stylization of real life,â€� SÃ¡nchez said.</p><p dir="ltr">Though most of the experiment participants were university students, SÃ¡nchez said this, too, adds to the robustness of their methods â€” 40.9% of people under 25 in Spain are unemployed, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the highest youth unemployment rate for OECD companies.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œSo we thought that they would be, for this particular problem, a very good audience because this is something that touches upon what they are going through now,â€� SÃ¡nchez said. â€œSo in that respect, Iâ€™m more confident.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">He added, though, that the results of the experiment are likely applicable outside Spain. Finland, for example, experimented in 2017 and 2018 with a universal basic income and <a href="https://www.kela.fi/web/en/news-archive/-/asset_publisher/lN08GY2nIrZo/content/results-of-the-basic-income-experiment-small-employment-effects-better-perceived-economic-security-and-mental-wellbeing">found</a> that it improved individualsâ€™ mental and economic well-being, though the employment effects were small, which SÃ¡nchez said disproves the common argument that a universal basic income would cause fewer people to work.</p><p dir="ltr">The Spanish government, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52707551">begun</a> its own nationwide experiment with a monthly basic income, providing approximately $500 to each adult in the program. Spain is prioritizing families, including single-parent households, and hopes to reach 1 million homes with the initiative.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, SÃ¡nchez said he hopes to see more research done on robots and automation, especially around how a tax on substituting a human with a robot might impact the economy.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œItâ€™s probably something governments could try at least on a smaller scale for some sectors and see what happens,â€� he said. â€œBecause this is something that, outside of this experiment, I havenâ€™t seen.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">Though a worker-replacement tax could help pay for a universal basic income, SÃ¡nchez and his colleagues also wrote in their research that an automation tax might impede technical change, which could pose long-term problems for society.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œSo other theoretical studies would be useful, too, in whatâ€™s the way to either prevent workers from being substituted by machines or to get money from the guys that are now using machines to compensate the workers that are laid off,â€� SÃ¡nchez said. â€œThese two schemes need a lot of research. Thereâ€™s very little done there.â€�</p><p dir="ltr"><em>The study â€œRobots, labor markets, and universal basic income,â€� published Dec. 16, 2020, in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, was authored by Antonio Cabrales, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; PenÃ©lope HernÃ¡ndez, Universitat de ValÃ¨ncia; and Angel SÃ¡nchez, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> It is a mystery often mentioned in the foundations of mathematics that our best and strongest mathematical theories seem to be linearly ordered and indeed well-ordered by consistency strength. Given any two of the familiar large cardinal hypotheses, for example, generally one of them proves the consistency of the other. Why should this be? The phenomenon is seen as significant for the philosophy of mathematics, perhaps pointing us toward the ultimately correct mathematical theories. And yet, we know as a purely formal matter that the hierarchy of consistency strength is not well-ordered. It is ill-founded, densely ordered, and nonlinear. The statements usually used to illustrate these features are often dismissed as unnatural or as Gödelian trickery. In this talk, I aim to overcome that criticism—as well as I am able to—by presenting a variety of natural hypotheses that reveal ill-foundedness in consistency strength, density in the hierarchy of consistency strength, and incomparability in consistency strength. </p>



<p>The talk should be generally accessible to university logic students, requiring little beyond familiarity with the incompleteness theorem and some elementary ideas from computability theory.</p>

      <h3 id="accidental-habit-development-a-year-of-walking">Accidental Habit Development: A year of walking</h3><p>I'm terrible at setting new habits. I've tried every habit app, journal method, hiding things, etc and I'm still at around 10% success rate of choosing a new habit and sticking to it.</p><p>One thing I've learned: I'm equally terrible at the habit of using habit apps.</p><p>Nearly by accident, I set a new habit in 2020 that has been consistent for 320 straight days: taking a walk. February last year, I set a (tiny) goal of walking for at least 10 minutes. Every day. I used the Streaks App, but connected to Apple Heatlh. Any time I started a walk on the Apple Watch, the time was automatically tracked in Streaks. No manual tracking required. Any time I completed a walk of 10 minutes or more, I'd get a push notification from Streaks happily encouraging me for completing my task and updating my progress.</p><p>When I first started, I was consistent because of a nascent willpower. I'd set a goal in a moment of aspriation and wanted it done. Walking 10 minutes was also <strong>easy</strong>: if I was close to missing a day, I'd feel silly not to walk 5 minutes away from my house and back. The Streaks app also acted as a safety net. If I hadn't completed a walk, I'd get a notification <strong>prompt</strong> that I was about to "break the streak". FOMO kicked in and I'd dutifully get up and start a brisk walk. It was also <strong>automated</strong>, I didn't have to build the habit of using a habit app, everything just worked. </p><p>Here's why:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease:</strong> Instead of trying to make a big change, the task was very achievable, even when motivation was low. It's more important to build consistency. The snowball rolling down the top of the mountain.</li><li><strong>Automated:</strong> The main value of a habit app is showing progress and keeping you honest (see prompts below). The problem is they require a separate behavior: tracking if your goal is done! Because the tracking is coupled with the behavior (taking a walk updates the Streaks app), all the value is received with no extra effort.</li><li><strong>Prompts: </strong>The system defaults to "internal" prompts: I should walk because I want to. But, if it's an off day or motivation is low, the Streaks app detects when a miss is imminent and sends a notification. It's like a safety net for habit development.</li></ul><p>Over time something changed... I wasn't doing the walk because it was easy. I was walking because it was just something I did."You're awake, time to walk." Walks became more than just a basic way to improve fitness. They became thinking time, time to call my Dad, or jot notes and thoughts. Now I walk 1-2 hours every morning (have had to wake up earlier for this) and can't imagine giving it up.</p><figure><img src="https://kylewill.blog/content/images/2021/01/Slice-1--52-.png"></figure><h3 id="how-does-behavior-science-explain-why-this-works">How does behavior science explain why this works?</h3><p>BJ Fogg founded the Behavior Design Lab at Stanford and has popularized the <a href="https://behaviormodel.org/">"Fogg Behavior Model" (FBM)</a>. The FBM states that each <strong>behavior</strong> consists of: sufficient <strong>motivation</strong>, sufficient <strong>ability</strong>, and the presence of a <strong>prompt</strong>. Without all three, the behavior doesn't happen. </p><figure><img src="https://kylewill.blog/content/images/2021/01/image.jpeg"><figcaption>Credit: BJ Fogg (behaviormodel.org)</figcaption></figure><blockquote>Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt</blockquote><p>This explains why the walking habit stuck while others have not. The behavior required very little motivation or ability. Most importantly, loading the next prompt required zero behavior. The act of walking loaded up the next prompt and Streaks could know whether to alert to a potential miss. </p><p>What if I could apply the same principles to other habits? A system to <strong>automatically prompt</strong> <strong>easy</strong> habits?</p><h3 id="automated-information-diet-habits">Automated Information Diet Habits</h3><p>One key 2021 focus for me is my information diet. There's a glut of urgent, must-know-now, break-neck-paced news coming out the past year. And it's not slowing down. I want to stay informed, but doom-scrolling doesn't help.</p><p>The first part of improving my information diet involved setting limits on <strong>neutral-bad inputs: </strong>increase social media (Twitter/LinkedIn for me) use, mindless reddit browser, etc. h/t to Brendan Short's "<a href="https://whatilearned.substack.com/">What I Learned</a>" Substack for ideas to limit Screen Time. </p><p>The second part involves increasing input of <strong>good inputs.</strong> I'm trying to increase the time I spend reading books and long form articles. And I've found a system (10 days in) that uses the same principle as the walk habit.</p><p><strong>Here's how the system works high-level:</strong></p><figure><img src="https://kylewill.blog/content/images/2021/01/Slice-2--10-.png"></figure><ol><li>Whenever I open an app for long-form articles or books (Pocket, Kindle) a timer is started in Streaks automatically</li><li>When I close the app, the timer is stopped</li><li>When the cumulative goal time (10 minutes for now) is reached, the daily Streak is marked complete</li></ol><p>That's it. That's the system. It hits all the necessary ingredients:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease:</strong> The goals are simple 10 minutes reading a book and 10 minutes reading for learning. And since the goal is cumulative time, dropping into a book for 2 minutes still has positive reinforcement. </li><li><strong>Automatic: </strong>No need to separately track the goal. The act of doing the task is coupled with tracking the goal.</li><li><strong>Prompts:</strong> The Streaks app notifies externally if I'm about to miss a streak. But I'm also testing a new passive prompt: app recommendations. I've replaced half my home screen with a widget that displays "Siri recommended apps". Based on how you use your phone, apps are suggested to open. I'm noticing Kindle and Pocket showing up in this list more and more over the past ten days. </li></ul><p>So far, I'm 100% covering every day (even though not every day has been high motivation). Excited to share more as the habits build momentum.</p><hr><h3 id="how-exactly-the-system-works-and-how-you-can-use-it-too-">How exactly the system works. And how you can use it too.</h3><p>The secret to automatically tracking my reading involves the Streaks habit app, and Apple's built-in Shortcuts app. </p><p>Shortcuts allow for setting up workflows on your iPhone/iPad similar to IFTTT or Zapier but for apps. They also include "Personal Automations" that automatically run shortcuts when certain conditions are true: connecting to WiFi, arriving home, or (importantly) when certain apps are opened or closed. </p><p>I created two shortcuts that accept the name (or keyword) of a Timed Task in Streaks, and start or stop respectively the timer for that task. </p><p>For each app I want to trigger a Timed Task, I create a "Start" and "Stop" Personal Automation that includes the name (or keyword) of the desired Task and starts when a given app is opened or closed. </p><h3 id="running-this-yourself-">Running this yourself. </h3><figure><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Ak0p6VFDT4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>How the automatic tracking looks at the end.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p><ul><li>Install the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/streaks/id963034692?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Streaks App</a> and setup at least one <em>timed </em>task.

    <p><a href="https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-hermit">RustyHermit</a> is a unikernel, which is completely written Rust. <a href="http://unikernel.org/">Unikernels</a> are application images that directly contain the kernel as a library, so they do not require an installed operating system (OS).&nbsp;They are typical used in virtualized environments, which build the backbone of typical cloud / edge infrastructures.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>


<h2 id="virtualization-designs">Virtualization Designs</h2>
<p>Common virtualized environments are based on classical <strong><em>virtual machines</em></strong>. In this case, complete machines are emulated or virtualized and common operating systems are running on both host and guest site:</p>
<p><img src="https://rust-osdev.com/showcase/rusty-hermit/common_vm.png" alt="Structure of a common virtualitation environment"></p>
<p>This technique is established (VMware, Hyper-V, etc.) and widely used. However, it introduces additional overhead especially regarding memory consumption and performance.</p>
<p>An alternative approach to common virtual machines is <strong><em>OS-level
virtualization</em></strong>, where the&nbsp;kernel&nbsp;allows the existence of multiple
isolated&nbsp;user space&nbsp;instances. These isolated instances are also known
as container. A typical representative is LXC or Docker and promise less
overhead in comparison to common virtual machines. However, the
isolation between the processes is weaker and may provide less security.</p>
<h2 id="unikernels">Unikernels</h2>
<p>Often only one application (e.g. a web server) is running in the container or the virtual machine. In this case, a <em>unikernel</em> is an attractive solution. The kernel is provided as static library and linked to the application. As the images directly contain the OS kernel, unikernels can directly be booted inside a virtual machine and do not require the typical software stack containing a Linux kernel and its userland within the VM.</p>
<p>Unikernels do not provide system calls in the classical sense, as everything is running with the privilege level of a kernel and what is typically done via system calls is provided via a common function call. At first glance, this sounds more insecure than previous approaches. However, these kernels are expected to run within a virtual machine, which isolates the application from the real system. In addition, common compiler analysis is used to check the complete software stack and unneeded components can even be removed, which can reduce the attack surface of the application.</p>
<p><img src="https://rust-osdev.com/showcase/rusty-hermit/libos.png" alt="Structure of a library operating system"></p>
<p>Well known unikernels are kernels such as <a href="https://mirage.io/">MirageOS</a>
and <a href="http://www.unikraft.org/">Unikraft</a>. MirageOS is written in OCaml,
while Unikraft still uses C as programming language. In contrast to these
kernels, RustyHermit is completely written in Rust to benefit from
Rust's performance and security behavior.</p>
<h2 id="rustyhermit">RustyHermit</h2>
<p>In principle, every existing
Rust application can be built on top of RustyHermit. However, unikernels
are a single tasking operating system. Consequently, the support of the
system call <code>fork</code> and inter-process communication are missing. In
addition, a classical C library is missing, which is typical used as
interface to the operating system. Every crate, which bypasses the
standard runtime and tries to communicate directly to operating system
does not work without modifications. However, many applications do not
depend on these features and work on RustyHermit.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>Unikernels can be highly optimized. For instance, we optimized the
network stack of RustyHermit. RustyHermit uses
<a href="https://github.com/smoltcp-rs/smoltcp">smoltcp</a> as network stack, which
is completely written in Rust. As interface between guest and host
operating system, we use
<a href="https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Virtio">Virtio</a>, which is in a
para-virtualized driver for KVM and widely used in virtualized Linux
environments.</p>
<p>The following figure compares Linux with RustyHermit,
where both are running as guests inside a virtual machine running on top
of a Linux-based host system:</p>
<p><img src="https://rust-osdev.com/showcase/rusty-hermit/bandwidth.png" alt="Bandwidth of the RustyHermit's exerimental network interface"></p>
<p>Especially for small messages RustHermit
is faster in than Linux.</p>
<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
<p>RustyHermit is also a research project to evaluate new operating
system designs, which improves the scalability and the security of operating systems in cloud environments. For instance, RustyHermit provides classical
techniques to improve the security behavior like stack guards and
separating the application stack from the libOS stack. However, a
library operating system typically uses a common function call to enter
the kernel. A classical separation of user- and kernel space by
entering a higher privilege level is missing.</p>
<p>We presented in a
<a href="https://www.ssrg.ece.vt.edu/papers/vee20-mpk.pdf">paper</a> a modified
version of RustyHermit, which provides an intra-unikernel isolation with
<em>Intel Memory Protection Keys</em> (MPK). MPK is a relatively new hardware
primitive that provides per-thread permission control over groups of
pages in a single address space with <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc19/presentation/park-soyeon">negligible switching overhead</a>,
making it a compelling candidate for use in unikernels.</p>
<p>MPK is requiring modification of page tables at a small performance cost. Four previously-unused bits of each page table entry (the 62nd to the 59th on x86-64) are exploited by MPK. Since MPK exploits four bits of the page table entry, it supports up to 15 protection keys.
MPK controls per-thread permission on groups of pages. Each core has a PKRU register (32 bits) containing a permission value. The value of the PKRU register defines the permission of the thread currently running on that core for each group of pages containing a protection key in their page table entries. Unlike page-table-level permission, MPK provides thread-local memory permission.</p>
<p>We provide user / kernel separation so we simply see the entire application as an untrusted component, independently of application-specific characteristics such as the language it is written in or the level of skill of the application’s programmer. In addition, we divide the kernel code into trusted and untrusted components. Trusted kernel components represent pieces of code written with a memory-safe language, i.e., offering strong security guarantees. Untrusted kernel components correspond to code written either in memory-unsafe languages or in unsafe Rust code blocks.</p>
<p>By entering the library operating system through the application binary interface the protection keys will be automatically changed, which allows access to the kernel stack and the kernel heap. Unauthorized access from within the application will trigger a pagefault, which will be handled by the library operating system.</p>
<h3 id="example-project">Example Project</h3>
<p>To give you an example on how to build an RustyHermit application, lets create a new cargo project:</p>
<pre><code><span>cargo</span><span> new hello_world
</span><span>cd</span><span> hello_world
</span></code></pre>
<p>RustyHermit currently requires the nightly versions of the Rust toolchain.
To simplify the workflow, we recommend to create the configuration
<em>rust-toolchain</em> as follows to define the required components and to
tested version of nightly compiler:</p>
<pre><code><span>[toolchain]
</span><span>channel </span><span>= "</span><span>nightly-2020-12-23</span><span>"
</span><span>components </span><span>= [ "</span><span>rustfmt</span><span>", "</span><span>rust-src</span><span>", "</span><span>llvm-tools-preview</span><span>"]
</span><span>targets </span><span>= [ "</span><span>x86_64-unknown-hermit</span><span>" ]
</span></code></pre>
<p>The configuration file specifies the required components and the version of the nightly compiler to use.</p>
<p>The RustyHermit's target <code>x86_64-unknown-hermit</code> is part of Rust
supported platforms, but doesn't belong to the <em>tier 1</em> platforms,
which means that official binary releases aren't available and the
standard runtime must be build from scratch.
To simplify this build process, we recommend to create the configuration
file <code>.cargo/config</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code><span>[unstable]
</span><span>build-std </span><span>= ["</span><span>std</span><span>", "</span><span>core</span><span>", "</span><span>alloc</span><span>", "</span><span>panic_abort</span><span>"]

[build]
</span><span>target </span><span>= "</span><span>x86_64-unknown-hermit</span><span>"
</span></code></pre>
<p>To bind the library operating system to the application, we have to add the crate <a href="https://crates.io/crates/hermit-sys"><code>hermit-sys</code></a> to the dependencies in the file <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span># Cargo.toml

</span><span>[target.'</span><span>cfg(target_os = "hermit")</span><span>'.dependencies]
</span><span>hermit-sys </span><span>= "</span><span>0.1.*</span><span>"
</span><span>features </span><span>= ["</span><span>smoltcp</span><span>"]
</span></code></pre>
<p>The feature <code>smoltcp</code> is required if your application tries
to establish a TCP connection. In this case, the library operating systems
includes the TCP/stack <a href="https://github.com/smoltcp-rs/smoltcp">smoltcp</a>.
In addition <em>hermit-sys</em> depends on the tool <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-download">cargo-download</a> to download required components and must be installed with the command <code>cargo install cargo-download</code>.
Finally, the application can be build with the common command <code>cargo build</code>.</p>
<p>The result is a 64-bit excutable in the <a href="https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/elf/elf.pdf">executable link format</a> (ELF).
To start the application within a common virtual machine, a loader is required, which initialize the processor and start the applications.
We provide a simple loader on <a href="https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-loader">GitHub</a>.
A makefile to build the loader is part of the project.
After that, Qemu can be used to start RustyHermit in a VM as follows:</p>
<pre><code><span>qemu-system-x86_64 -display</span><span> none</span><span> -smp</span><span> 1</span><span> -m</span><span> 64M</span><span> -serial</span><span> stdio</span><span>  -kernel</span><span> path_to_loader/rusty-loader</span><span> -initrd</span><span> path_to_app/app</span><span> -cpu</span><span> qemu64,apic,fsgsbase,rdtscp,xsave,fxsr
</span></code></pre>
<p>To improve the performance, KVM can be used to use the virtualization extension of modern processors.</p>
<pre><code><span>qemu-system-x86_64 -display</span><span> none</span><span> -smp</span><span> 1</span><span> -m</span><span> 64M</span><span> -serial</span><span> stdio</span><span>  -kernel</span><span> path_to_loader/rusty-loader</span><span> -initrd</span><span> path_to_hello_world/hello_world</span><span> -enable-kvm -cpu</span><span> host
</span></code></pre><h3 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h3>
<p>For the near future, we plan to stabilize the interface to the hardware.
For instance, the support of <a href="https://virtio-fs.gitlab.io/">Virtio-fs</a>
is in an early stage. In addition, the integration into Rust standard
library isn't finalized yet and the current version runs only on x86. In the
future, we want to also support aarch64 as processor architecture.</p>

				<p>I consider myself a software craftsman. As every craftsman, I take good care of my craft. I create it, I augment it, and occasionally I reduce it. </p><p>Adding new features always makes me happy and I can understand why. I augment something that I really care about, making it even better. What I find difficult to understand is why I take so much joy when I am deleting code.</p><p>It just doesn't make sense. Every line of code I wrote has cost me time and/or mental effort. Sometimes a significant amount of both. I should feel bad when I figure out that I don't need this massive block of code or this feature is just useless and needs to be removed. </p><p>My only explanation is that it has to do with my mental model when building and understanding software. By default, I try to fit the entire program I am working on in my mind. By fit, I mean that, at some capacity, I try to be able to "dry run" the program myself. I can "calculate" what output the program might produce when certain inputs are given. </p><p>And I do this almost all the time while developing. When modifying a method, when refactoring some part of the code, when moving variables around. I quickly perform "tests" to ensure that I am not breaking anything.</p><p>(Ideally, software is split into self-contained modules for this exact reason: to be able to work on a module without the need to understand almost anything outside of it. But in reality, this rarely happens. Modules are rarely self-contained and small enough projects are not split into modules at all. Anyway, this is a subject for another time.)</p><p>Therefore, I suspect that the joy I get when I have to delete some code is not for the deletion per se. The joy comes from the simplification. If the codebase is reduced then it will be easier to "fit" it in my mind when trying to "dry run" it.</p><p>This better understanding leads to increased happiness when working on the codebase and the joy I am referring to. I am not happy about getting rid of something I spend time and energy on in the past. I am happy because the reduced code size will require less mental effort when working on that project.</p><hr><p><a href="https://www.rockandnull.com/subscribe/"><strong>Subscribe to our non-annoying-once-a-month digest :)</strong></a></p><hr><p>So there you go. Go and delete that unneeded feature without feeling guilty about the joy you get. Until another feature takes its place and you are back to square 0 :)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <section itemprop="articleBody"> <p>SwiftUI was introduced to the world at WWDC in June 2019. While the main goal for SwiftUI is to build rich user interfaces on iOS and other Apple platforms, it can also be used to do other fun things.</p> <p>I couldn’t resist using SwiftUI from the command line, and I wrote about it in <a href="https://medium.com/@eneko/rasterizing-swiftui-views-from-the-command-line-80d974356c4a">Rasterizing SwiftUI views from the command line</a> to showcase how to generate static images (PNG, JPEG, etc). I published the code in GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/eneko/ConsoleUI">ConsoleUI</a>.</p> <p>Last December I used this same technique to generate social media preview images for this blog. I wrote <a href="https://www.enekoalonso.com/articles/issue-13">Generating Social Media preview images with SwiftUI and GitHub Actions</a> so other people like you could do it too.</p> <p>Today, I’m writing about generating application icons for iOS with SwiftUI. You guessed it: from the command line.</p> <h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2> <p>You can start by cloning my <a href="https://github.com/eneko/ConsoleUI">ConsoleUI</a> repo, which I have updated today to run on Xcode 12.4 with the latest SwiftUI available. Feel free to begin with an empty project too. If you do this, you’d probably want to follow the steps on the README file from that repo, or refer back to my first article on this topic.</p> <p>Xcode does not support live previews on Swift packages yet (FB8979344). To allow for realtime previews follow these steps:</p> <ol> <li>Generate an Xcode project (<code>swift package generate-xcodeproj</code>)</li> <li>Add a macOS target to the project</li> <li>Add your view to the macOS target (target <code>Foo</code> on the screenshot below)</li> </ol> <p>The generated project and target files don’t need to be committed to your repository, but you can do it if that makes it easier for later use.</p> <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32922/105608907-b6c90800-5d5a-11eb-80d9-32de73138e75.png" alt="MySwiftUIView"></p> <p>If you cloned <code>ConsoleUI</code>, at this point you should be able to run the following commands:</p> <div><div><pre><code>swift build                  <span># build project</span>
swift run <span>&amp;&amp;</span> open test.png   <span># rasterize image and open in Preview app</span>

<h4>Everything you’d find in a great downtown.</h4>



<p>The Block at Bell Works is home to a diverse, growing roster of retailers and restaurants, all centered around its dramatic, quarter-mile atrium, which has been repurposed as an enclosed pedestrian street we call “The Block.” Visitors can stroll along the thriving, climate-controlled avenue that offers all the appeal of an urban ‘main street’, including an expansive food hall, pour-over coffee bar, and an array of retailers. The Block also hosts the monthly pop-up Bell Street Farmer’s Market, where local artists, artisans and other vendors put their unique creations on display.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>On January 14 this year, Google bought Fitbit (a &nbsp;wearables company) for 2.1 billion dollars!</p><p>The question is why a big name like Google buy a smaller company like Fitbit and such an acquisition is worth billions of dollars?!</p><p>The same question goes for many big names and another question comes up because these big companies have very talented engineers who are able to replicate what small ones can do. So what makes big companies think about buying more in the first place?</p><p>Reasons may differ from one company to another; it may also interchange with another reason, but we can distill some important reasons why acquisitions can happen to small brilliant startups.</p><h2>Increasing market share</h2><p>Acquiring a startup from a big company point of view can make the big one have the small company’s clients hence its market share will increase. That’s what happened when Uber acquired Careem for $3.1B to <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/uber-careem/" target="_blank">expand the greater Middle East region</a></p><h2>Geographical diversification</h2><p>When a dominant company sees potential in a specific geographic region, it looks for a rising startup that has a strong chance of growth.</p><p>However, this is the riskiest reason for acquisition because of the differences in culture, management, marketing, and sales between the acquired company and the corporate.</p><p>Example: Amazon acquiring Souq.com (<a href="https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/why-amazon-acquired-souqcom/" target="_blank">the biggest e-commerce player in the Middle East</a>) for $580M in cash</p><h2>Product diversification</h2><p>Companies develop their businesses by diversifying their products into new ones to expand their sales from new products and acquire new customers.</p><p>Examples: </p><ul role="list"><li>Acquiring Google to many small companies that are not in its primary market (search engines)</li><li>Facebook acquiring Oculus (the Virtual Reality company) as Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-facebook-bought-oculus-2014-11" target="_blank">reported</a>, “a new communication platform.”</li><li>Amazon acquiring Twitch (the video live streaming service)</li></ul><h2>Eliminating potential competition</h2><p>In 2012, Facebook bought Instagram — the 13-employee company that time which had 15 million users. Acquired for 1 billion dollars.</p><p>Two years later, Facebook bought WhatsApp — a 50-employee company that had 450 million active users at that time. The acquisition was worth $19B!</p><p>Eliminating a potential competition for Facebook in the long-term was a big reason why the acquisitions for WhatsApp and Instagram happened. It’s quite intuitive that we use our phones, the more data the platform collects, so the more money!</p><p>On the other hand, Blockbuster — an 84,300-employee company in 2004 founded in 1987 which could have bought Netflix for $50 million but the CEO considered that as a joke. </p><p>Blockbuster had 400+ stores and was dominating in the video rental industry until Netflix left it behind and now Blockbuster has just 3 employees and 1 store in Dallas!</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Reasons vary when a big firm acquires a startup whether to increase their market share, enter a new market region, diversify their products, or eliminate potential competition.</p><p>Whatever the reason is, it should always end up with high profitability to the acquirer in the long run and an instant revenue to the acquired one.</p><h2><a href="http://bit.ly/3mneyrK" target="_blank">Click here</a> to get fresh content to your inbox</h2><h2>Resources</h2><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/netflix-blockbuster-meeting-marc-randolph-reed-hastings-john-antioco.html" target="_blank">Blockbuster Could Have Bought Netflix for $50 Million, but the CEO Thought It Was a Joke</a></li><li><a href="https://ar.quora.com/%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AA" target="_blank">لماذا تشتري الشركات الكبري الشركات الناشئة</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Alphabet" target="_blank">List of companies acquired by Google</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/19/crazy-like-a-facebook-fox/" target="_blank">A Year Later, $19 Billion For WhatsApp Doesn’t Sound So Crazy</a></li><li><a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/uber-careem/" target="_blank">Uber to Acquire Careem To Expand the Greater Middle East Regional Opportunity Together</a></li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-facebook-bought-oculus-2014-11" target="_blank">The Real Reason Facebook Bought Oculus</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/why-amazon-acquired-souqcom/" target="_blank">Why Amazon Acquired Souq.com</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/03/amazon-souq-com-completed/" target="_blank">Amazon completes its acquisition of Middle Eastern e-commerce firm Souq</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-nears-deal-to-acquire-twitch" target="_blank">Amazon to Acquire Twitch for $970 Million — The Information</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_LLC" target="_blank">Blockbuster | wiki</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gazprom-energy.co.uk/blog/diversifying-and-entering-new-markets-how-to-plan-for-success/" target="_blank">Diversifying and entering new markets: How to plan for success</a></li></ul><p>Published on my new medium publication:&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/the-brainwave/why-big-companies-buy-small-ones-be95211b29a6?sk=bac17084562fedf6550f86504955921e">Brainwave</a>, make sure to follow it!<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>Sparked by <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1273307320911450112">an interesting Twitter discussion</a>, I’ve spent a lot of time recently thinking about different proof-of-work mechanisms. </p>



<p>When I say proof-of-work, I’m not talking about consensus algorithms like the ones that some crypto currencies use. I’m talking about social networks.</p>



<p>At their core, social networks are primarily about one thing: Building social capital through signaling. As I wrote in <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling as a Service</a>, signaling can be broken down into three different components:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Signaling Message</strong><br>A hidden status subtext you’re trying to convey about yourself</li><li><strong>Signaling Distribution</strong><br>The channel through which you’re communicating your signaling message</li><li><strong>Signaling Amplification</strong><br>Ways to boost your signaling message to compete against status rivals</li></ul>



<p>For example: A Patagonia vest signals both a prosocial attitude (<em>“I care about the environment</em>“) as well as wealth (“<em>I can afford to spend $500 on a jacket</em>“). Depending on where you live, it might also signal something about <a href="https://vcstarterkit.com/">your occupation</a>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/patagucci.png"></p><p>In order to signal these messages to others and build actual social capital you need a signaling distribution channel. One option would be to wear the vest in public where others can see it – but there are obvious physical constraints to the size of the audience you’d be able to reach.</p>



<p>This is where social networks come in.</p>



<p>Their primary role is to distribute signaling messages at scale and transform them into quantifiable social capital (in the form of likes and followers).</p>



<p>As social networks grow, they increase the potential reach of your signaling messages – but they also get crowded with status rivals. This is why social networks typically provide you with a set of signaling amplification tools. These tools help you boost your signaling messages and stand out from the crowd.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling as a Service</a> I compared signaling amplification to <a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service">Eugene Wei’s idea of proof-of-work hurdles</a>, which he describes as follows:</p>



<p><i>Almost every social network of note had an early signature proof of work hurdle. For Facebook it was posting some witty text-based status update. For Instagram, it was posting an interesting square photo. For Vine, an entertaining 6-second video. For Twitter, it was writing an amusing bit of text of 140 characters or fewer. Pinterest? Pinning a compelling photo. You can likely derive the proof of work for other networks like Quora and Reddit and Twitch and so on. Successful social networks don’t pose trick questions at the start, it’s usually clear what they want from you.</i></p>



<p>But the more I think about it, the less I like the comparison. I actually think that Eugene’s proof-of-work theory only scratches the surface of what social networks actually do.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>02</span> A closer look at proof mechanisms</p>



<p>Take a look at this very cliché Instagram picture. The photographer clearly put a lot of thought and effort into its composition and applied different filters and editing tools to make it look nicer.</p>



<figure>
<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/creativework.png">
<figcaption><span>Full disclosure: I actually took this picture from Unsplash. No influencers were harmed during the production of this blog post.<br></span>
</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s a perfect example of Eugene’s definition of proof-of-work. <br>Proof-of-<strong><em>creative</em></strong>-work, to be more exact. </p>



<p>Editing your photo helps to amplify your signaling message and sets you apart within Instagram’s status arena (aka the newsfeed). It also adds additional signaling messages to your post: <em>“Look how great a photographer I am”</em> or <em>“I’m a creative person”</em>.</p>



<p>But those are not the main signaling messages you are communicating here. What you really want to tell your followers with this photo is something along the lines of <em>“I’m a world-traveler”</em> and <em>“I’m in a happy relationship”</em> <span>(which in turn are also just signaling proxies for wealth and mating worthiness)</span>. </p>



<p>The photo and the location tag are your proof points.</p>



<figure><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/igexample02-1.png">
<figcaption><span>If you look closely, you’ll notice additional hidden signaling messages in the form of Allbirds sneakers and what’s most likely a Patagonia vest → proof-of-ownership<br></span>
</figcaption></figure>



<p>Social networks are therefore not only signaling distribution (and amplification) networks – they also allow users to prove their signaling messages. </p>



<p>The creative proof-of-work is just pretext and helps to boost your post. What’s more important are the additional proof mechanisms that social networks provide. In the case of Instagram those are photos and location tags.</p>



<p>Instagram is essentially “pics or it didn’t happen”-as-a-service.</p>



<p><span>03</span> Implications for new social networks</p>



<p>When new social networks emerge they have to introduce new proof mechanisms to differentiate themselves from existing incumbents. These can either be novel proof-of-creative-work hurdles or completely new proof-of-x mechanisms.</p>



<p>TikTok is a good example for proof-of-<em>creative</em>-work innovation. The app provides creators with a powerful set of video editing tools that have opened a whole new level of creativity. </p>



<p>The cost to participate in TikTok’s status game is a lot higher than Instagram’s <span>(compare a well-made dance choreography on TikTok to your median Instagram travel post)</span> – but its powerful feed algorithms also make discovery easier and thus reward users faster and with more social capital. </p>



<p>TikTok doesn’t add any new proof points beyond its novel creative work hurdle though. You can signal and prove your creativity but you could achieve the same by uploading your video to Instagram.</p>



<p>Strava, on the other hand, introduced an entirely new proof mechanism: Proof-of-physical-activity. By using your phone’s GPS sensor (or a 3rd-party fitness tracker), users can actually prove how much and fast they ran or cycled. In contrast to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/20/grounded-private-jet-hire-helps-russians-fake-lavish-lifestyles/">Instagram</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/da/article/wdaqgw/instagrams-ballers-discount-private-jets-324">photos</a>, Strava’s proof mechanism is a lot harder to fake <span>(though there are <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fake+strava+5k+downhill&amp;oq=fake+strava+5k+downhill">exceptions</a>)</span>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stravaproof.png"></p><p>What’s great about Strava is that it reinforces a behavior that’s actually good for you: While the status game that initially got you into the app might be zero sum, the actual physical exercise you have to put in to compete has a very positive, compounding effect.</p>



<p>The question is: What other social networks should we build that could have similar positive feedback loops? And what are their proof mechanisms?</p>



<p><span>04</span> Strava for X</p>



<p>Let’s start with the two examples in <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1273307320911450112">this tweet</a>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tweetstrava.png"></p><p>I love the idea of a <strong>Strava for Cooking</strong> – but I’m very skeptical that it can be built. Why? Because the necessary proof mechanisms don’t exist.</p>



<p>The primary metric you optimize on when cooking is taste. But how would you measure or quantify taste? The closest proxy to taste that we have is optics: How good does the meal that you cooked look? This can easily be proved with a photo .. but that’s a proof-of-work mechanism that Instagram already offers (including filters to make your food look nicer). As long as no one comes up with a better proof mechanism for cooking, I think it’s unlikely that we will see a successful social network in the space.</p>



<p>I’m more optimistic about <strong>Strava for Learning</strong>.</p>



<p>While the activity of learning itself might be hard to quantify, you can measure the outcome of learning: knowledge. Has anyone built a multiplayer version of <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> yet? Flash cards would be a perfect proof-of-knowledge mechanism and could easily be turned into a game where you compete against friends.</p>



<p>Similar to physical activity in the Strava example, learning is not something that most people enjoy doing. As TikTok founder <a href="https://youtu.be/wTyg2E44pBA?t=245">Alex Zhu points out</a>, education goes a little against human nature. In combination with a strong enough signaling mechanism however, you can get users to participate. It’s kind of the opposite of <a href="https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network">Chris Dixon’s famous “Come for the tool, stay for the network” strategy</a>. Come for the status, stay for the tool.</p>



<p>A related product I’d love to see is <strong>Strava for Reading</strong>. Imagine an eBook reader that not only tracks how much time you spend reading but also *what* you are reading. Based on these proof-of-(reading)-work mechanisms you could build streaks or GitHub-contributions-like visualizations that incentivize users to read more (and more regularly).</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/githubforreading.png"></p><p>You could even build leaderboards for different topics based on the content of the books and articles you read. Or think about a score that indicated how balanced your reading behavior per topic was (to incentivize users to read takes on political topics from different perspectives).</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I think it’s unlikely that we will see a product like I described anytime soon. <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1086659965719404544">The world’s largest bookstore, most popular eBook reader, and biggest social network for books</a> are all owned by a company that has very little competency in design and user-facing product innovation.</p>



<p>(Side note: Amazon’s monopoly on books might be the most underrated sub-optimal equilibrium in tech.)</p>



<p>Another app that would be interesting is a social investing app. Think “Robinhood but as a social network”. It seems like investing is already quite a social activity – just look at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/reddit-s-profane-greedy-traders-are-shaking-up-the-stock-market">communities like r/wallstreetbets</a>. As <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1250703738634829824">patio11 pointed out</a>, Robinhood already feels more like a game than a finance app.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/robinhood.png"></p><p>So why not build an investing app that opens with a feed of all your friends’ investments and their returns over time? Instead of sharing screenshots on Reddit and Instagram you could prove your investments right in the app.</p>



<p><strong>Note that an app like this would not be about signaling wealth. It’s about signaling <em>being right</em> and the ability to prove it</strong>. This is probably an even stronger and more engaging mechanism than signaling wealth – and the reason why I’m still bullish on prediction markets.</p>



<p>Perhaps a well-designed, consumer-friendly prediction market app would be the ultimate proof-of-x social network. <strong>Strava for being right.</strong></p>



<p><span>05</span> A Closing Ask</p>



<p>While we are on the topic of being right: Do you agree with my thoughts in this post? What other social networks and proof-of-x mechanisms would you like to see?</p>

		<p><strong>UPDATE (10:22 AM ET Jan 27):</strong> A Moderna press release yesterday provides additional data enabling us to refine our production rate estimates. We are in the process of analyzing this additional information, and will issue our revised production rate estimate on Thurs, Jan 28 at 10 AM Eastern.</p>

				<p>
					<span>UPDATE JAN 27, 2021:</span><br>Moderna has not announced the U.S. release of any additional lots of its COVID-19 vaccine since our last update on Monday, Jan. 25. Moderna's U.S. vaccine delivery rate averaged 476,000 doses per day during the latter half of December, but has dropped substantially in the new year, currently averaging just 277,000 doses per day since January 1. <strong>This is a new record low rate for the company in 2021.</strong>
				</p><p>
					To put Moderna's creeping production rate in perspective: the company would need to sustain a manufacturing rate of 1.1 <em>million</em> doses per day in order to fulfill its commitment to deliver 100 million doses by the end of March...a goal that currently looks unachievable. At its present production rate it will take until December for the company to reach its March goal.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>TECH NOTE: A LOT OF TROUBLE</span><br>
					Moderna's vaccine lot number 041L20A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-18/moderna-vaccine-allergic-reaction-california-batch">made the news</a> last week when a cluster of 6 vaccine recipients in San Diego developed severe allergic reactions, prompting the state of California to place a temporary hold on vaccinations using that lot. Moderna and the FDA are currently investigating the issue.
				</p>
				<p>
					From our perspective as dose-trackers, that event provided both some new information <em>and</em> some additional uncertainty. Our estimates of the number of US doses delivered by Moderna hinge on our assumption regarding lot sizes - how many doses of vaccine bear the same lot number. We base our estimate of that number on <a target="_blank" href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-provides-covid-19-vaccine-supply-update">Moderna's own statement</a>, on January 4, that <em>"approximately 18 million doses have been supplied to the U.S. Government to date,"</em> plus its report of 26 lots delivered up to that time, enabling us to calculate an average of 692,000 doses delivered to the US government per lot.
				</p>
				<p>
					Last week's news regarding lot 041L20A thus surprised us, when <a target="_blank" href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/statement-california-department-public-health-cdph-report">Moderna revealed</a> that the lot in question comprised 1.27 million doses, of which 964,900 had been delivered to the government.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the moment we have chosen to stick with our initial estimate of an average of 692,000 doses delivered to the government per lot, rather than the number revealed this week for lot 041L20A (965,000 doses) because the former is based on the average of 26 lots, whereas the latter is based on a single lot. We will continue to monitor information from several sources, including Moderna itself, and may adjust our lot size estimate in future, as warranted by available evidence.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>WHY THE SLOWDOWN?</span><br>Moderna has not yet publicly discussed the dial-back in its U.S. manufacturing rate, so we're left to speculate. Our best guess is supply chain issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					Previously, Moderna's vaccine was produced exclusively by contract manufacturer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lonza.com/">Lonza</a> at its Portsmouth NH facility. But that changed this week when Lonza gained <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-swiss/lonza-gets-swiss-ok-to-start-moderna-vaccine-production-paper-idUSKBN29808X">approval</a> from Switzerland's regulatory agency, Swissmedic, to begin manufacturing at its huge Visp, Switzerland facility as well. Lonza's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1682852/000168285220000023/lonzamodernagltafullye.htm">contract</a> with Moderna stipulates that <em>"In no event will LONZA or its Affiliates ship, or be instructed to ship, to the United States any Product Manufactured at any Facility outside of the United States."</em> That means that raw materials like the specialty lipids that go into Moderna's vaccine, which may be in short supply, are now needed by two facilities, only one of which makes vaccine for the U.S. market. The data we report here reflects only U.S. production.
				</p>
		
				<p><span>WHERE THE DATA COMES FROM:</span><br>Pharmaceutical companies normally treat their manufacturing data like state secrets, sharing them with the FDA only because they are required to, and even then only in strictest secrecy, out of the public eye. But these aren't normal times, and so the public has an unusual opportunity to track <a target="_blank" href="https://www.modernatx.com/">Moderna Therapeutics</a>' COVID-19 vaccine production rate with unprecedented clarity.</p>
			
				<p>The company's RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, authorized by the FDA on December 20th of last year, was rushed to market long before the company knew for sure just how long the product's shelf life would be. At the time, ongoing testing had already established that its shelf life was <em>at least</em> 6 months, but still more testing would be required to reveal how much <em>longer</em> than that it might be safely stored before losing potency. That's a critical void in our knowledge for a vaccine that is America's best hope (so far) for stemming the pandemic that has already killed more than a third of a million Americans. So Moderna took the unusual step of printing no expiration dates on its vaccine vials, instead providing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.modernatx.com/covid19vaccine-eua/providers/vial-lookup">a page on its web site</a> where pharmacists and other interested parties can search for a vial's lot number and learn the company's current best guess regarding its expiration date. That's helpful because the product's current six month shelf life is likely to be found in the near future to be considerably longer than that, so this web page enables the company to revise each production lot's expiration date as future data provides deeper insight.</p>
			
				<p>But that same expiration look-up page also (and apparently unwittingly) reveals to the educated eye everything we need to know in order to track Moderna's vaccine manufacturing pace <em>in real time</em>, eliminating our dependence on the company or the federal government for answers to the critical question of how rapidly it is is cranking out the life-saving vaccine doses that will ultimately bring this deadly pandemic to an end. When you type in a vaccine lot number and click the page's 'Submit' button, Moderna's web server (housed by Amazon Web Services) replies to that query with <a target="_blank" href="https://lnl-dl.s3.amazonaws.com/Moderna/expiry.json">a JSON file</a> listing every lot of vaccine the company has released so far, along with each lot's current expiration date. Back-calculating from that expiry date, using the current 6-month shelf life figure for the vaccine, thus enables us to determine each lot's manufacturing date. And finally, we know how many doses an average lot of vaccine includes, based on the company's <a target="_blank" href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-provides-covid-19-vaccine-supply-update">January 4th announcement</a> that <em>"approximately 18 million doses have been supplied to the U.S. Government to date."</em> The company had produced 26 lots of vaccine in the U.S. by that date, thus allowing us to calculate that an average production lot amounts to about 692,000 doses.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Web technologies have evolved a lot in the past few years, both on the server-side as well as on the client’s side. There are many web frameworks, UI kits, JavaScript libraries and everything you need to easily and rapidly develop a website or web application. JavaScript libraries have matured and gotten very powerful and processing power, even on low-end computers, does not really pose a problem nowadays for most web-apps. Because of this, web applications have gotten more complex, user interfaces fancier and… programmers lazy.</p><p>Because JavaScript frameworks are so powerful, many are tempted to write business logic in the client-side part of the application. While this can save processing power for the server by unloading computational tasks to the user, and is highly recommended when ever possible, it may pose some security problems. This is especially true if the user can submit data to the server via forms or other input method.</p><p>Because of this, always perform server-side validation of any request, even if you (usually) have a client between the server and the user. Let us look at three scenarios and how failing to validate the input received poses a security vulnerability. Furthermore, even though it may seem obvious that there is a problem, this is not always the case and variations from all three scenarios were real problems I saw in real products.</p><h4>Scenario 1: Privilege escalation by altering user role</h4><p>For the first scenario we will be looking at an application that has different roles for registered user. It can be any such web-app, but I will consider it a content management system like WordPress. Here, users can have different roles: Administrator, Editor, Contributor, Normal User. Any user that is Contributor or above can change the role of another user, but he can’t grant higher privileges than what he has. For example, an Editor can’t make somebody else an Administrator.</p><p>To achieve this, the user edit page has a form with the user’s information and a drop-down with the possible user roles. The page is rendered using the template engine (in this example I will be using Twirl from Play Framework) and the acceptable values are indeed supplied by the server. Our malicious user is a ‘Contributor’, so only two roles should be available for him.</p><div><div><pre><code lang="dart">&lt;select&gt;
@for(role&lt;-acceptableUserRoles) {
  &lt;option value="@role.getIdHash()"&gt;@role.getName()&lt;/option&gt;
}
&lt;/select&gt;</code></pre></div><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="388" height="116" src="https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png 388w, https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1-300x90.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px"></figure></div></div><p>Now, our programmer thought that he is smart and, for the value, he explicitly set it to an ID Hash. This is the hash of the ID of the role in the database since the app is quite complex and new roles can be added if needed. He even makes sure that the has received when a user is saved is valid and corresponds to an actual role. The method that handles the request looks something like this.</p><pre><code lang="java">public Result saveUserRole(Http.Request request) {
    Form&lt;UserInfoDTO&gt; form = formFactory.form(UserInfoDTO.class).bindFromRequest(request);
    if (form.hasErrors()) return badRequest();
    
    List&lt;Role&gt; roles = rolesDao.getRoles();
    Role submitedRole = null;
    for (Role role:roles) {
        if (role.getIdHash() == form.get().role()) {
            submitedRole = role;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (role == null) return badRequest();

    UserDO user = userDao.find(form.get().userId());
    if (user == null) return notFound();

    user.setRole(role);
    userDao.update(user);

    return ok();
}</code></pre><p>At first glance, everything seems to be ok. The form is validated, the role is validated, the user is requested from the database, and let’s even assume that there is a CSFR token that protects from malicious submits. Can you spot the problem? The server assumes that because the UI code was generated on the server, the role received is one of the roles that the user has permission to offer. There is no check to see if the role that is being attributed is not higher than what the current user has.</p><div><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="542" height="85" src="https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2.png 542w, https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2-300x47.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px"></figure></div><p>Our malicious user can simply open the inspector in the browser and edit the HTML to add a new value to the &lt;select&gt;</p></div><p>Yes, he must know the hash, but if other protection mechanisms aren’t in place, he can just brute-force it since he knows the format. If these are default values and not randomly generated at each install, the task can be even easier since the user can install a dummy application on his computer and find the hash this way.</p><h4>Scenario 2: Access to confidential pages by knowing/guessing the URL</h4><p>Another common mistake is failing to check if a user has access to a page or not. There are multiple variations on this, either by failing to validate that a page is accessible to a specific role or by failing to validate the visibility of a page. We will look at both cases here.</p><p>This time we will be dealing with the presentation website for a company and they are about to launch a new product. The editors write the needed materials, prepare the new product page and wait for the product to be revealed in a few days so they can publish the page. Everything is ready, including final URL for the new product page, since it had to be sent to news outlets beforehand.</p><p>One such outlet was not included in the original press release, but because it is a high-profile company and there are rumors about the new product, they want all the juicy info as well. So they begin to try and guess the URL of the new product page. They know the name of the product and based on passed products, have an idea of how the new page’s URL may look like. Since the CMS fails to validate that an article was actually published or not, by accessing the URL the news outlet has all the information they need and can freely publish them faster than any other news site.</p><p>A variation on this can happen in complex systems as well. It is not uncommon for some functionalities or pages of a site to be inaccessible if the user does not have the right role. The developer made a list of pages that are visible for each user and based on that list and the currently logged in user, it builds the menu in the HTML file. This is done in a similar fashion to the select form from the first scenario. If the developer assumes that the user will navigate only by clicking the menu items in the UI, he may oversee server-side validation. This way, an user can access a page that he is not supposed to simply by entering the correct URL. This is a problem quite frequently encountered in web-apps that are not mature or still undergoing development, but with a public version already released.</p><h4>Scenario 3: Server overload by abusing API calls</h4><p>In the next scenario, the problem is not only server-side validation but multiple coding decisions that together caused a server outage. It all started with a reverse-lookup for the coordinates (latitude and longitude) of an address using Google Maps API. The server was to place points on a city based on the address (Country, State/County, City only). The more addresses at a specific location, the bigger a dot would be on the map. If coordinates for the full address could not be found, it would drop the city and try for the State/County, and if that also fails, only for the country.</p><p>Now, for each new address, there would be a call to the Maps API after which the coordinates would be cached so that there won’t be a new call. This was done both for efficiency and for cost reduction since the API calls are taxed. The problem was that if the address was incorrect, nothing would be cached. It was assumed that, since the UI has drop-downs for all three input fields, the values would be correct.</p><p>Now, let’s change the scenario a bit and assume that instead of one user doing POSTs from a web page (something easily manageable via rate limiters), our server actually processes large files with thousands of entries. A typo in one of the countries caused each look-up to fail and as a result, a new call to the API for each entry in the file, rapidly rising costs, slowing down processing, and eventually putting a halt since all tokens available to the API were consumed.</p><p>Was the server-side validation the only culprit? Definitely not, but doing at least basic validations would have helped drastically reduce the number of calls. The list of valid countries is easy to include and even states/counties are doable without a lot of effort.</p><h4>Conclusions</h4><p>At this point, I hope it is obvious why server-side validation of input data is always needed. It may not always be enough to prevent a problem, but it will at least make it more manageable. In some cases, it can only cause minor inconveniences, but it most scenarios it can have serious consequences, data leaks or higher cost for the company.</p></div></div></div>]]>

January 24, 2021 | https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/a-new-newsletter/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/a-new-newsletter/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Dan Luu has been trying for months to persuade me that I should start a paid newsletter so that I can spend more time researching and writing interesting things. He hardly ever even mentions the existence of his own <a href="https://www.patreon.com/danluu/posts">private patreon posts</a> and still manages to make decent pocket money out of them, so this doesn't seem like an unreasonable idea.</p>
<p>I produce a lot of writing that mostly just gets sent to friends or left to rot on my hard drive. When I get around to turning something into a blog post it <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=scattered-thoughts.net">tends to end up on the Hacker News front page</a>. It still seems kind of crazy to me that anyone might want to pay for my writing, but it also used to seem crazy to me that people would pay for my code. Maybe I'm just not very good at capitalism.</p>
<p>So I'm going to give this a go - any <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/jamii">github sponsors</a> at any tier will get access to all the new posts. Using github instead of substack is maybe a weird choice, but I want to be able to embed katex and interactive demos in the posts and provide code alongside for examples and case studies. I also expect to be releasing more open-source software this year as a side-effect of doing less consulting.</p>

<p>Here are the kinds of things that I might be working on and writing about this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Big projects 
<ul>
<li>Past examples - <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/a-practical-relational-query-compiler-in-500-lines/">A practical relational query compiler in 500 lines of code</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/relational-ui/">A UI library for a relational language</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/julia-as-a-platform-for-language-development/">Julia as a platform for language development</a>, <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/reltron/">A UI for exploring relational databases</a></li>
<li>Designing a database query language that supports abstraction. An <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/imp-intro/">ongoing</a> project which is 80% done and just needs a sustained slog to finish the last 80% and produce a clear writeup and demo.</li>
<li>Building a text editor from scratch. An <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/focus">existing project</a>, already in daily use. Posts will start with absolute basics (eg how to render simple UI in opengl) and eventually catch up to ongoing development (currently working on editing 1gb files at 60 fps without dropping frames).</li>
<li>Benchmarking streaming systems. A new project for 2021. Existing streaming benchmarks suffer from problems like <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2015-01-15.md">measuring how well they can parallelize the overhead they added to the original problem</a>, <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2018-02-11.md">mostly measuring distributed json de/serialization</a> or even just <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2015/10/5/your-load-generator-is-probably-lying-to-you-take-the-red-pi.html">quietly ignoring pauses</a>. I want to figure out how to measure these systems correctly, begin to map out the space of engineering tradeoffs and try to extract some lessons for designers of future systems.</li>
<li>Building an embedabble relational database with incrementally maintained views. Another new project for 2021. An attempt to place the ideas from <a href="https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow/">differential dataflow</a> into a <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/why-isnt-differential-dataflow-more-popular/">more accessible</a> form.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Little projects
<ul>
<li>Past examples - <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/staged-interpreters-in-rust/">Staged interpreters in Rust</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/zero-copy-deserialization-in-julia/">Zero-copy deserialization in Julia</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/open-multiple-dispatch-in-zig/">Open multiple dispatch in zig</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/pinephone-first-steps/">Writing a simple app for the pinephone</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/vive-experiments/">Vive experiments</a></li>
<li>Ideas for 2021:
<ul>
<li>See if the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9152719">IJON fuzzer</a> can discover new planning bugs in SQL databases</li>
<li>Record my screen for an entire week long coding project. Find out where the time goes and what the bottlenecks are.</li>
<li>Figure out how to measure the battery usage of desktop programs on linux, and find the biggest offenders.</li>
<li>Figure out how to execute arbitrary zig expressions when debugging a running program. Maybe <a href="https://frida.re/">frida</a> can inject them?</li>
<li>There's some folk wisdom that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09930">multiway join algorithms</a> are more robust to planning errors than traditional binary joins. Is this true? Why?</li>
<li>Experiment with using <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/02/securing-firefox-with-webassembly/">embedded wasm sandboxes</a> to prevent memory safety bugs from escalating into vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Figure out how to systematically avoid common benchmarking mistakes eg is it possible to eg combine <a href="https://github.com/plasma-umass/coz">coz</a> and <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/%7Eemery/pubs/stabilizer-asplos13.pdf">stabilizer</a> or will they interfere with each other?</li>
<li>Can differential dataflow handle late-arriving data by using bitemporal timestamps?</li>
<li>Document how to use the <a href="https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy">tracy profiler</a> via C bindings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/">Distilling</a> existing research in my own field eg:
<ul>
<li>Why don't existing query planners work well for streaming systems?</li>
<li>How can we optimize query plans for worst-case performance over a range of input sizes, rather than best-case performance over the current input sizes?</li>
<li>Why do modern databases contain compilers?</li>
<li>How does <a href="https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow/">differential dataflow</a> work? How does it differ from <a href="https://github.com/janestreet/incremental">Incremental</a>? Which approach is better for which problems?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reading
<ul>
<li>Literature reviews, mostly focused on databases, query languages, query planning (especially in streaming systems), compilers, incremental view maintenance, self-adjusting computation</li>
<li>Book summaries. I <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/notes.html">used to publish</a> summaries of everything I read. Even though they aren't linked from anywhere anymore google still sends a few thousand people to them each month, so I guess they must be useful. I typically read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/scattered-thoughts">~100 books</a> per year, of which ~25 are non-fiction, mostly tech, cognitive science, economics, sociology etc. </li>
<li>Other curiosity-driven binges eg <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/qnd-review-of-ppig-1989-2015/">reading every paper ever published in the Psychology of Programming Interest Group</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Random musings eg <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/small-tech/">Small tech</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/frugality-is-non-linear/">Frugality is non-linear</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I've spent the last 7 years building database engines, query planners, compilers, developer tools and interfaces for <a href="https://materialize.com/">Materialize</a>, <a href="https://www.relational.ai/">RelationalAI</a>, <a href="https://developer.logicblox.com/technology/">LogicBlox</a> and <a href="http://witheve.com/">Eve</a>, as well as various smaller consulting gigs and personal research projects. I expect to be informative when talking about those subjects, and at least entertaining when talking about other subjects.</p>
<p>Some of the posts will also be published on this blog. Others will be exclusive to the newsletter. I expect the schedule to consist of bursts of activity interspersed with weeks of frustrated silence.</p>
<p>It may seem strange, but this is one of the most frightening things I've done in years. I can only see that as a good sign.</p>

    <div>
      <p>Please don’t call me if you are selling a monitoring project that uses AI to do amazing things.</p>
<p>Since 1991 I have been contacted by sales people from startups that use
AI to make their monitoring system awesome.</p>
<p>The first couple times I took their call and set up a demo.  I was always disappointed.</p>
<p>Now I just ignore these phone calls and emails.</p>
<p>None of those companies are in business any more.  Why?  Because they couldn’t make a product that is actually useful.</p>
<p>I’m going to let other fools waste their time with those demos.  Me?  I’ll believe
it when I see one of these companies actually have enough successful customers to
be profitable for 12 consecutive months. Then I’ll take a look.</p>
<p>I hate to be a hard-ass, but in those 27 years I haven’t seen an AI-based
startup that succeeded. Yes, there’s been a lot of progress in AI in the last 10
years. Sadly most of that progress has been in things that look good to
investors that don’t know any better.</p>
<p>AI-based monitoring is pre-destined to fail. Every 3-4 years I’ve been
contacted by such a startup. They’ve all gone under.</p>
<p>Why do these companies fail?</p>
<p>None of them made products that actually helped sysadmins (or devops or SREs, etc).  They made products that helped what an AI researcher thought would be useful.</p>
<p>By definition, an AI researcher does not have operational experience.</p>
<p>What they do invent looks good on paper, or looks good to a CEO, or an investor. None of those people understand what monitoring and alerting is really about.</p>
<p>Here are the claims I’ve heard:</p>
<p>“We can pin-point where the problem is” – Look, if I need software to do that, I’ve designed my system wrong.</p>
<p>“We can determine who should be paged” – Whoa whoa whoa. Are there companies
that just page one person for every problem and that person has to figure out
who should actually get paged?  That’s terrible. Each team should set up their own monitoring and alerting rules.  How the hell did you get into that situation in the first place?</p>
<p>“We can predict failures. You don’t have to write alert rules any more.” – I’ll believe it when I see it.  I can do that with linear algebra and a lot of compute power.
Or, I can save money and just do good capacity planning.</p>
<p>Look, to get real results the AI system would have to be bespoke for my
system. You think you can really create a general AI solution? I doubt it.</p>
<p>Here’s why your AI-based monitoring startup is going to fail:</p>
<ol>
<li>If I have a small system, it doesn’t need AI to help me.</li>
<li>If I have a big system, should be made up of components that are clearly defined so that I can route alerts properly.</li>
<li>If I have one NOC for all of my services and they’re chasing their tail trying to figure out root causes and who is responsible for each service… you have a management problem. First of all, NOCs are bad and you are bad for having one.  Second, there’s no single root cause. Third, if you don’t know who is responsible for each service, how the hell would an AI know better than you?  Get a damn technical project manager to talk with each team and help them get their monitoring and alerting in order.</li>
</ol>
<p>Look, the bottom line is that no matter how good you are at AI, Google
is better at it, and Google doesn’t even use AI in their monitoring system.
They use a little linear algebra in their capacity prediction system and
that’s about it. They use some machine learning for problems that are so
big that only Google would have those problems (and I don’t have those problems).</p>
<p>If you work for an AI-based monitoring startup here’s my honest advice: <em>Update
your resume and start sending it out. You’ve joined the wrong startup.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>January 24, 2021</p>
      <p>Clubhouse is moving quickly today, but in some ways it feels like the journey started a long time ago. The two of us met back in 2011 through a mutual friend, and we connected over a shared love of social products. Back then, Rohan had been working on ways to help friends find each other in cities, and Paul was building an app called Highlight to help people form friendships with others around them. Over the next ten years we both kept working on social products—experimenting with new apps, failing, and starting again.</p>
      <p>In the fall of 2019, we reconnected over some work that Rohan was doing to help his daughter Lydia, who was born with a rare genetic disease, and eventually that reconnection led to us finally teaming up to work together. Against our better judgment, and with the support of two very patient spouses, we decided to give social apps one last try.</p>
      <p>After a lot of iteration in the audio space, we launched Clubhouse in March of last year. Our goal was to build a social experience that felt more human—where instead of posting, you could gather with other people and talk. Our north star was to create something where you could close the app at the end of the session feeling better than you did when you opened it, because you had deepened friendships, met new people and learned.</p>
      <p>· &nbsp; · &nbsp; ·</p>
      <p>Unlike our other attempts, Clubhouse seemed to strike a real chord with people, and it has accelerated quickly over the past ten months—from a small handful of beta testers into a diverse and growing network of communities. This past week, two million people around the world—musicians, scientists, creators, athletes, comedians, parents, entrepreneurs, stock traders, non-profit leaders, authors, artists, real estate agents, sports fans and more—came to Clubhouse to talk, learn, laugh, be entertained, meet and connect. It’s the most exciting thing we’ve ever been a part of.</p>
      <p>The thing we love most is how voice can bring people together. No matter where you live in the world or what networks you have access to, in Clubhouse you can be in the room—often with people whose lived experience has been very different from your own. In one of the most turbulent and troubled years many of us have experienced, people on Clubhouse have come together for important and nuanced conversations on topics of social justice reform, BLM and anti-racism. When Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, room after room filled the hallways with people discussing constitutional law, sharing stories about RBG’s childhood, and praying in silence together. Each week, parents of children with genetic diseases gather in Clubhouse to discuss medical developments with doctors, researchers and other parents—talking, debating and learning.</p>
      <p>We’ve also been blown away by the brilliance and creativity of the Clubhouse community. Each night in Clubhouse, there are now thousands of rooms filled with people hosting game shows, recapping NBA games, singing opera, discussing philosophy, meeting other musicians, sharing travel tips, running support groups, and meditating together. They’re hosting daily talk shows, performing standup comedy, playing guitar and giving history lectures. In December, forty strangers who met on Clubhouse auditioned, rehearsed, and hosted a full-blown musical production for thousands of people that made national headlines. They are creating entirely new ways for people to come together, all through the power of voice.</p>
      <p>· &nbsp; · &nbsp; ·</p>
      <p>Our focus now is on opening up Clubhouse to the whole world. With that goal in mind for 2021, we have secured a new round in funding, led by Andrew Chen at a16z, who also led our Series A. It’s always been important to us to have investors who care deeply about diversity, and who will work hard to help us make Clubhouse a welcoming and inclusive community. We now have over 180 investors in Clubhouse—large and small, spanning many different races, genders, and areas of expertise, and including many members of our early community. While we’ve never felt that fundraising itself is a milestone, we wanted to share how we plan to use these funds to make the product better each day and to help creators on Clubhouse thrive:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Welcoming more amazing people 🎉</strong> &nbsp; From the earliest days, we’ve wanted to build Clubhouse for everyone. With this in mind, we are thrilled to begin work on our Android app soon, and to add more accessibility and localization features so that people all over the world can experience Clubhouse in a way that feels native to them.</li>
          <li><strong>Keeping the servers up 👩🏽‍💻</strong> &nbsp; We’ve grown faster than expected over the past few months, causing too many people to see red error messages when our servers are struggling. A large portion of the new funding round will go to technology and infrastructure to scale the Clubhouse experience for everyone, so that it’s always fast and performant, regardless of how many people are joining.</li>
          <li><strong>Ensuring you get fast support ⚡️</strong> &nbsp; User safety has always been a top priority for us, and as we welcome more people, it will remain one. This means scaling up our Trust &amp; Safety and Support teams as we grow, continuing to invest in advanced tools to detect and prevent abuse, and increasing the features and training resources available to moderators. We’ll also be aggressively growing our support team so that everyone’s clubs can get same-day approval. :)</li>
          <li><strong>Improving ranking and discovery 🌍</strong> &nbsp; As we’ve grown, the number of conversations happening on Clubhouse has skyrocketed, and it’s our job to help you find the right ones each time you open the app. With this new round of funding we’ll be investing heavily in discovery so that we can show you people, clubs, and rooms that are perfectly tailored to your interests—and help you discover new rooms you never would have thought to look for.</li>
          <li><strong>Investing in creators 👨🏽‍🎤</strong> &nbsp; Creators are the lifeblood of Clubhouse, and we want to make sure that all of the amazing people who host conversations for others are getting recognized for their contributions. Over the next few months, we plan to launch our first tests to allow creators to get paid directly—through features like tipping, tickets or subscriptions. We will also be using a portion of the new funding round to roll out a Creator Grant Program to support emerging Clubhouse creators.</li>
        </ul>
      
      <p>We know we have said this before, but we are so incredibly grateful to everyone who has joined Clubhouse, given us their feedback during Town Halls, shared their stories, and been part of the journey so far. We built Clubhouse to be a blank canvas filled with amazing people, and it is nothing without the incredible people who fill the rooms each day.</p>
      <p>We’re working hard to scale Clubhouse as fast as we can and open it up to everyone soon. In the meantime, anyone can join with an invite from an existing user, or sign up for the <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/">waitlist</a> so we can welcome you in soon. We are also <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/joinclubhouse" target="_blank">hiring in all areas</a>, so if you are excited about our mission, we would love to talk with you.</p>
      <p>Thank you again. It means so much to us to be able to build this product for you, and we’re so excited for this next chapter.</p>
      <p>- Paul, Rohan and the Clubhouse team</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few months ago, I received an email from Revolut (a British fintech company) in which they proudly unveiled their new logo. Previously, Revolut had a distinct and instantly recognizable logo. They replaced it with… something I was sure I had seen before.</p><figure id="w-node-3786e8b28af7-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51cf030355219306e8edf_revolout-logo-old-new.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The previous Revolut logo had a unique font, a recognizable color gradient, and it was slanted. If you were to put 100 financial or tech companies’ logos next to each other, the old logo would be easy to find at a glance.</p><p>If you put the new one in the same 100 logos pile, it would drown in the sea of sameness.</p><h2>Sans serif invasion</h2><p>There is a trend in logo design that started around 2017-2018. It’s as if many companies decided that being unique was a handicap and that it was better to be like everyone else. Or at least, that’s how it feels to me.</p><p>The trend started with fashion logos. Many iconic fashion companies ditched their recognizable logos and switched to a bland and very similar version of a sans serif font.</p><p>The technology sector followed soon after.</p><figure id="w-node-519323ea72d8-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51d96d2b8eae559c71d90_tech-fashion-logos-sans-serif.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>All the quirks, peculiarities, and idiosyncrasies of both tech and fashion logos were dropped and replaced with a simple sans serif font.</p><p>It looked like two huge industries decided to use the services of one designer, and not a particularly inventive one at that.</p><p>The tech industry is in slightly better shape because they didn’t go all in, and at least they kept the colors. With the colors, there’s at least <em>some </em>variability:</p><figure id="w-node-1efc3a7d060a-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51dc4daea171c45c758db_tech-logos-color.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Variability in new fashion logos, in full color:</p><figure id="w-node-b31dea70a84e-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51dd2ab19486dcee8bcea_fashion-logos-color.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Serif and sans serif—what’s the difference?</h3><p>First, what’s the difference between serif and sans serif fonts?</p><figure id="w-node-7e6a894d6cf3-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51e06556217fb8d809964_serif-sans-serif.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The small features on the ends of strokes in some fonts are known as ‘serifs’.</p><p>Fonts without those small features are called ‘sans serif’ (<em>‘sans’</em> means <em>‘without’</em> in French).</p><p>Sans serifs are missing a few of the typical anatomical features (serifs, spurs, swashes and other flourishes). Because of that, this typeface lacks the level of detail and design differentiation that serif typefaces can have.</p><p>While the simplicity of sans serif fonts makes them readable and versatile, it has its drawbacks. Without additional details and features, sans serif fonts have far fewer options for differentiation. While you can vary things like the height, weight, and slant, sans serif fonts simply have fewer features to work with than their more intricate fellow fonts.</p><p>This results in logos that look very similar. Gone are all the elaborate little details of the previous era.</p><p>When you add brands’ tendency to go black-and-white, you end up with a sea of logo sameness which is the opposite of what logos should be.</p><p>The purpose of a logo is to be instantly recognizable, different, memorable, and, if possible, to refer to the brand’s values. Blending into everyone else’s achieves none of these things.</p><h3>Sans serif history</h3><p>Sans serif lettering and fonts, first created in 1816, were popular for their clarity and legibility at a distance in advertising and display use when printed very large or small.</p><p>Because sans serif type was often used for headings and commercial printing, many early sans serif designs did not feature lowercase letters.</p><p>Simple sans serif capitals, without the use of lowercase, became very common in uses such as tombstones of the Victorian period in Britain.</p><p>Also, a significant reason for serif faces in the older days of imprecise letterpress and less consistent paper surface sizing was to compensate for ink spread and aberrations. Serifs on the fonts helped in cases where corners would otherwise fail to fully imprint.</p><h2>Possible reasons</h2><p>What are the possible reasons for this sans serif trend taking over? And why do hardly any of them matter?</p><h3>‘Modern utility’</h3><p>Branding specialists point to the practical benefits of what they call the ‘modern utility’ of sans serif typefaces. Cleaner and more legible, they are better suited to a variety of media and work particularly well online. The purity of these fonts allows the brands to be an empty vessel, ready to accommodate rapidly shifting trends.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> That may be true, but isn’t the whole value of a brand to <em>not</em> be an empty vessel? The big brands have worked decades for their identity and recognition, only to throw most of it away?</p><h3>Simplification</h3><p>Another reason cited by brand specialists is that it’s a natural step for brands to take as they grow from scrappy startups into established brands. The goals have shifted from making noise and standing out to being a trusted, dependable part of people’s everyday lives. That heartfelt personality and idiosyncrasy that defined a brand as they started out, and won over their early adopters, can be a limitation as they aim for broad appeal and bigger revenue.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Simplification as a reason to blend in for broad appeal? I don’t buy it. Logos should be simple, yes, but they should be simple in a memorable way. Think more in terms of Nike swoosh (simple, memorable),&nbsp; and less in a one-size-fits-all sans serif font.</p><h3>Brands are more than logos now</h3><p>People at the head of these powerful brands know that they are not defined by their logo anymore but by the product or service they provide. They are strong thanks to what they allow <em>you</em> to do with them.</p><p>Before, logo designers would look for a ‘concept’ when designing a logo. That is not necessary anymore: <em>The brand is the concept</em>.</p><p>Their thinking goes that logos may look similar, but what they offer is completely different and effective, and that’s what ultimately counts for the consumer.</p><p>As some brands become words (or even better, verbs) in our daily language (to Google, to Uber, to Skype), they have a lesser need for a recognizable logo. Many of those brands now spend on designing custom typefaces instead of logos: a custom typeface becomes their recognizable voice on every platform or device.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Some big brands may indeed have a lesser need for a very distinct logo but that doesn't mean that they should get rid of an important differentiator. You don’t see Nike replacing their swoosh logo with sans serif <strong>NIKE</strong> text. If you have something valuable that you <em>can</em> live without, it doesn’t mean that you <em>must</em>.</p><h3>Readability</h3><p>One of the main reasons for the sans serif logo trend is readability. Especially on mobile, but everywhere else as well: from huge billboards to tiny footer links at the bottom of mobile websites.</p><p>After all, that’s the very reason why sans serif fonts were invented: for better readability in advertising headlines.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Readability is obviously important. Mobile too—it’s where everything happens nowadays. But this is becoming less of an issue with improvements in technologies like retina displays and 4k screens becoming popular.</p><figure id="w-node-38988d1753c7-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51e96e07b893538cbb00b_sans-serif-logos-on-iphone-11.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Here’s how a bunch of logos looks on my iPhone 11</figcaption></figure><p>If it’s easy to fit 30 decently looking logos on one-third of a phone screen, it should be trivial to make one logo, however quirky, look perfect on mobile.</p><p>Revolut seems to be torn here. They did replace the logo everywhere inside the app, but how does their new app icon look like?</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51ed3fd0200eeffdc690d_revolut-app-icon.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>What next?</h2><p>There’s nothing bad in wanting your logo to look simpler, better, mobile-ready, or universal enough to appeal to the broadest possible audience.</p><p>But don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p><p>Shoot for simplicity and legibility, but keep your distinguishing features. Don’t throw away what the brand has been working on for decades.</p><p>Otherwise, you may end up in a situation where you could slap any logo on any product and hardly anyone would notice a difference:</p><figure id="w-node-01df0773e426-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fbf32ea6160018ba6a9cb84_sans-serif-bags.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>One of these bags is real.</figcaption></figure></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>The “Fediverse” is a loose aggregation of federated servers that mainly speak the ActivityPub protocol. One of the most famous services in the Fediverse is “Mastodon.” We joined the Fediverse in the early days of Mastodon to share short-lived information that didn’t fit into a separate article on our website.</p><h2 id="the-issues-that-we-discussed-earlier-this-year">The issues that we discussed earlier this year</h2><p>In May, <a href="https://infosec-handbook.eu/news/2020-05-31-monthly-review/#fediverse">we reconsidered our presence in the Fediverse</a>. Back then, the main issues for us were:</p><ol><li>You can’t migrate your posts if you need to migrate to another Mastodon server.</li><li>You can’t update your posts without losing shares and comments.</li><li>All posts have a character limit, so we can’t say everything we want in a single post.</li><li>Many Fediverse users claim to be the “better and open-minded alternative to Twitter.” We think that this doesn’t reflect reality, as explained below.</li></ol><p>In June, we addressed issues 1 to 3 by introducing a “News” section on our website.</p><h2 id="further-issues-in-the-fediverse-and-other-social-networks">Further issues in the Fediverse and other social networks</h2><p>We also participated in discussions and tried to encourage dialogs in the Fediverse and other forums instead of only posting information. However, these discussions revealed consistent issues:</p><h3 id="the-toxic-us-vs-them-ideology">The toxic “us vs. them” ideology</h3><p>For some groups, it is vital to make a bogeyman out of opposing parties. In the Fediverse, some individuals and groups continuously spread misinformation about “the others” to gain likes and followers. While most of the toxic behavior targets the big tech companies in the USA, some individuals targetting us.</p><h3 id="the-reverse-burden-of-proof">The “reverse burden of proof”</h3><p>When discussing with others, we often encountered the “reverse burden of proof.” Somebody posts negative claims about a product or service. Instead of providing (technical) proof for the claim, the only supporting “fact” is, “everybody knows that this is true.” On the contrary, this person doesn’t accept any (technical) proof that debunks their initial claim. For us, it looks like you don’t need to provide any real facts as long as you satisfy the ideology of some people.</p><h3 id="the-i-read-headlines-only-problem">The “I read headlines only” problem</h3><p>Many people read the headlines of a post and then guess what is written in the remaining article. Such behavior results in misinterpreted information and persistent myths. On the other hand, it became a standard tool for some blogs to gain more readers: Writing, “Critical security vulnerability could leak all of your data” results in more clicks and shares than, “Company fixed potential security vulnerability months ago, which could have leaked some of your data if ever exploited.” This problem kills meaningful discussions instantly.</p><h3 id="the-security-and-privacy-by-assumption-problem">The “security and privacy by assumption” problem</h3><p>Most of you know “security by obscurity,” when security relies on keeping the implementation secret. We see another common issue: “security and privacy by assumption.” Many people share security and privacy tips without ever checking whether these tips work. They just assume that somebody else checked it before.</p><h3 id="and-finally-comparing-apples-to-oranges">And finally, “comparing apples to oranges”</h3><p>For instance, some people claim the Signal messenger became insecure after introducing the Signal PIN because a server-side attacker could now access your data. The base for this claim is the assumption that a server-side party extracts encrypted information from the volatile main memory of a server, exploits an unpatched security vulnerability in Intel CPUs to extract a key, and successfully guesses a user-provided password.</p><p>While the attack looks anything but trivial as these people describe it, they then argue that their favorite messenger is far more secure due to being decentralized. They compare the encryption mechanism of instant messenger A with something else. Suppose you look at the same feature of their favorite messenger. In that case, you see that their messenger doesn’t offer any server-side protection. In their case, a server-side party can directly access your data in cleartext—this is trivial.</p><h3 id="im-privacy-friendly-please-donate">“I’m privacy-friendly; please donate”</h3><p>The issues mentioned above are also prevalent on other social networks like Twitter. Just like on Twitter, you see “privacy-friendly” companies trying to gain more paying customers or some bloggers heavily involved in influencer marketing. While most of them claim that this is for a “good cause,” it is ultimately all about money.</p><h3 id="decentralization-still-isnt-a-privacy-feature">Decentralization still isn’t a privacy feature</h3><p>Now, some people may insist that at least security and privacy are far better “due to the decentralized nature” of the Fediverse. As we wrote several times before, “decentralization” isn’t a privacy feature.</p><p>Search engines like Google can discover and index all of your public posts in the Fediverse. By default, you can see the social graphs of all accounts, as followers are public. Especially Mastodon servers come with privacy policies that don’t meet the European GDPR requirements. Many (Mastodon) servers seem to run an outdated version, indicating inadequate security practices.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Should you become part of the Fediverse by creating an account? It isn’t up to us to decide this, of course.</p><p>If you only want to read the content of others, we recommend subscribing to their RSS feeds. Your RSS subscriptions are private and more decentralized than any Fediverse account. And you need to manage one account less on the internet.</p><p>If you want to be an active part of the Fediverse, be prepared for the same problems as on any other social network. We decided to leave the Fediverse for now.</p><h2>Read also</h2><ul><li><a href="https://infosec-handbook.eu/news/2020-12-20-contact-and-feed/">On contacting us, and subscribing to our RSS feed</a></li><li><a href="https://infosec-handbook.eu/news/2020-11-08-rss-update/">Update of our RSS/Atom feed</a></li><li><a href="https://infosec-handbook.eu/news/2020-08-02-tls-insights/">TLS usage of InfoSec Handbook readers</a></li><li><a href="https://infosec-handbook.eu/news/2020-08-01-introducing-the-news-section/">Introducing the 'News' section</a></li></ul></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>MONTREAL -- 
	A team of researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute believe they have found an effective weapon against COVID-19: colchicine, an oral tablet already known and used for other diseases.</p>
<p>
	For Dr. Jean-Claude Tardif, who led the study, this is a "major scientific discovery," he said. Colchicine is the first "effective oral drug to treat out-of-hospital patients."</p>
<p>
	"To be able to offer this, from Quebec, and for the planet, we are very happy," said Tardif.</p>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.colcorona.net/" target="_blank">The ColCorona study</a> involved 4,159 patients whose diagnosis of COVID-19 had been confirmed by a nasopharyngeal test (PCR).</p>

<p>
	Analysis of the study found that colchicine resulted in reductions in hospitalizations by 25 per cent, the need for mechanical ventilation by 50 per cent, and deaths by 44 per cent.</p>
<p>
	"This is the first hope for patients who have COVID, who are worried and who hope that they will not have complications," said Tardif. Previously, "there were no tablets that could be taken by mouth and reduce the risks."</p>
<p>
	Tardif said he believes that prescribing the drug could help reduce congestion in hospitals quickly and reduce health-care costs in Quebec and elsewhere.</p>
<p>
	"Our study showed the effectiveness of treatment using colchicine to prevent the phenomenon of the major inflammatory storm and reduce complications related to COVID-19," he said.</p>
<p>
	As colchicine is a well-understood drug, it could be used very quickly to treat people with COVID-19, the researcher says.</p>
<p>
	"Colchicine is old as it is -- we've been treating gout with it for hundreds of years -- so it's available in pharmacies," Tardif said, speaking in French.</p>
<p>
	"So any doctor, tomorrow, who reads this can definitely decide to prescribe if he wants."</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>READ THE STUDY:&nbsp;READ THE STUDY: <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.26.21250494v1">Efficacy of Colchicine in Non-Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19</a></strong></li>

</ul>
<p>
	On Friday evening, Quebec Premier Francois Legault called the study "big news" on social networks.</p>
<p>
	In the spring, Legault said the Colcorona study was one of the largest studies in the world researching ways to fight the virus.</p>
<p>
	The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was deployed in Canada, the United States, Europe, South America and South Africa.</p>
<p>
	"It was a double-blind study, meaning neither the patient, nor the team that ran the study, including me, knew whether the patient was taking the placebo or the drug," explained Tardif.</p>
<p>
	"There was just one group, independent from us, which was aware."</p>
<p>
	He said the team is "very proud of the work accomplished -- it is a clinically convincing result," adding that he assembled a spectacular team from all over Quebec including microbiologists, intensive care specialists, statisticians, computer scientists and epidemiologists.</p>
<p>
	The Centre de Coordination des Essais Cliniques de Montréal (MHICC) of the Montreal Heart Institute coordinated the study.</p>

<div>


<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>The words media outlets use to describe events play a large role in shaping public perception of those events. As January 6 unfolded on Capitol Hill, there was a rapid shift in language, from “<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-senators-reverse-objections-electoral-college-certification-protesters/story?id=75099780" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>protesters</span></a>,” “<a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2021/0112/How-a-mob-stormed-the-Capitol-and-how-to-stop-another-assault" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>supporters</span></a>,” and “<a href="https://theconversation.com/nonprofits-helped-organize-the-pro-trump-rally-before-the-capitol-siege-but-they-probably-wont-suffer-any-consequences-153271" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>rally</span></a>” to “<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress-combat-veteran-military-experience" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>siege</span></a>,” “<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/ex-firefighter-robert-sanford-arrested-for-allegedly-hurling-fire-extinguisher-at-cops-during-capitol-riots" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>rioters</span></a>,” and “<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/08/1015929/archive-capitol-insurrection-trump-maga-footage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>insurrection</span></a>.” These choices — on the day of the attack and in its aftermath — matched the descent of a seemingly peaceful protest into a violent and dangerous attack on the seat of the U.S. federal government.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Using 5,057 article titles about the Capitol Riot from 398 sources across the political spectrum, The Factual examined how the events and aftermath of January 6 are most commonly described in U.S. and global media. This includes the differences in language between left- and right-leaning publications, as well as how the terminology used compares to <a href="https://blog.thefactual.com/protest-riot-headlines-george-floyd" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>our analysis</span></a> of coverage of the George Floyd protests this summer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Note: An article’s title is not always a perfect representation of its content, but titles matter deeply in shaping readers’ perceptions of what media outlets are writing, whether there are contrasting views between political parties, and whether/how an event matters — especially in the social media era.</em></p>
<h4><strong>The Words Used to Describe January 6</strong></h4>
<p>The U.S. media ecosystem includes hundreds of outlets, reflecting the myriad ideologies, political alignments, and niche areas of interest that motivate the American populace. They help define the core issues that drive American political and social discourse, and the words they use are central to how Americans understand current events. It should be no surprise, then, that the ways the media talks about the events of January 6 are key to building a consensus about what happened and unpacking how such an event may impact the U.S. going forward.</p>
<p>While there are some clear differences in the way the left and right talk about the Capitol Riot, instances of agreement are a good place to start. For example, there seems to be broad consensus that January 6 constituted a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/capitol-police-intelligence-report-before-capitol-breach-warned-congress-itself-could-be-targeted" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>riot</span></a>, not something less intense like a <a href="https://theprint.in/world/terrorism-or-protest-how-the-us-media-saw-the-siege-of-the-capitol/582443/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>protest</span></a> or something more intense like a <a href="https://theconversation.com/was-it-a-coup-no-but-siege-on-us-capitol-was-the-election-violence-of-a-fragile-democracy-152803" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>coup</span></a>. Around 40% of article titles from both left-leaning (41.3%) and right-leaning (38.2%) outlets in our sample used the term “riot.” While the term “protest” was twice as likely to appear in titles from the right, the term appeared in just 5.5% of all articles, demonstrating that the term was inadequate to capture the day’s events. Meanwhile, “rally,” the purported nature of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stop-the-steal-organizer-gop-members-helped-him-plan-rally-2021-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>pro-Trump gatherings</span></a> prior to the riot, appeared in just 1.2% of titles.</p>

<p>Other words were used with roughly similar frequency regardless of the publisher’s political bias. Reporting from across the political spectrum mentions “violent” or “violence,” “siege,” and “police” about the same amount, reflecting at least a partial shared understanding of the lengthy clashes between police and the numerous rioters. Further, just 16 of the 5,057 article titles included the word “peaceful.”</p>

<p>A third of article titles on the left (33%) and a quarter of those on the right (26%) mention Trump, highlighting a shared understanding of his proximity to the events of January 6. However, there are some clear differences in usage. While many of the article titles from the right are <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/donald-trump-pressure-condemn-violence-capitol-twitter-rage" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>ambiguous</span></a> about Trump’s role, articles from the left directly accentuate his <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-55574780" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>connection</span></a> to the riot, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/us/politics/trump-video-capitol-riot.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>slow condemnation</span></a> of the violence, and <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/01/trump-capitol-attack-impeachment-evidence-insurrection.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>culpability</span></a> in the aftermath.<img src="https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=403&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-01-23 at 6.34.26 PM" width="403" srcset="https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=202&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png 202w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=403&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png 403w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=605&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png 605w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=806&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png 806w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=1008&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png 1008w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=1209&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png 1209w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px"></p>
<div><p>Language also varied when discussing the behavior of the rioters. Article titles on the left were more likely to mention “mob,” “attack,” and “insurrection,” zeroing in on how pro-Trump supporters engaged in <a href="https://www.axios.com/mob-violence-trump-republicans-condemn-d508f105-aa77-435f-bd81-f4e74b011694.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>violent action</span></a> against DC Capitol Police and invaded the Capitol building.</p><p><img src="https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png?width=409&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-01-23 at 6.34.33 PM" width="409" srcset="https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png?width=205&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png 205w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png?width=409&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png 409w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png?width=614&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png 614w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png?width=818&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png 818w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png?width=1023&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png 1023w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png?width=1227&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png 1227w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px"></p></div>
<div><p>Overall, these differences in terminology reflect the political landscape in the aftermath of January 6 in two ways: (1) a central consensus clearly labels the event as a riot and shares some broad interpretations of the day’s events, and (2) on average, left-leaning interpretations accentuate the violent, seditious nature of events while right-leaning publications take a softer tone.</p></div>
<h4><strong>How These Words Compare to the George Floyd Protests</strong></h4>
<p>Just as many saw fundamentally different responses to the George Floyd protests and the Capitol Riot, The Factual’s data reveals a few differences in the way these events were described in the media. (This analysis uses an <a href="https://blog.thefactual.com/protest-riot-headlines-george-floyd" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>earlier study</span></a> we conducted based on a similarly sized dataset of 4,958 article titles from the 10 days following George Floyd’s killing.)</p>
<p>Most prominently, the George Floyd protests were far more likely to be described using the word “protest” (44.9%) and far less likely to involve “riot” (2.9%) than the Capitol Riot. The events on Capitol Hill were 10 times as likely to be described as an “attack,” while the George Floyd protests were 5 times more likely to be described as “peaceful.” This makes intuitive sense since the George Floyd protests encompass hundreds of separate events and were <a href="https://time.com/5886348/report-peaceful-protests/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>93% peaceful</span></a>. The Capitol Riot, on the other hand, refers specifically to a single event where numerous <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/injured-police-officers-were-evacuated-from-capitol-hill-protests-2021-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>violent incidents</span></a> took place. Importantly, however, this highlights that efforts to equate the Capitol Riot with the George Floyd protests — for whatever purpose — are of <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/false-equivalency-black-lives-matter-capitol-siege-experts/story?id=75251279" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>limited use</span></a>.</p>

<p>There is also generally more agreement between left- and right-leaning outlets about what terminology to use to describe the Capitol Riot. <a href="https://blog.thefactual.com/protest-riot-headlines-george-floyd" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Our analysis</span></a> of coverage of the George Floyd protests showed larger divergences between left and right, for example, in terms of usage of “protest” or “riot”:</p>
<p>[A]rticles from outlets on the right featured “riot,” “riots,” or “rioting” in 12.9% of all article titles, while only 2.6% of article titles on the left featured those terms. Similarly, article titles on the right were twice as likely (8.1%) to use some variation of the word “loot” than the left (3.8%). Conversely, articles on the left were 10% more likely (43.7%) to feature a variation of the term “protest” than those on the right (33.8%), and 7.8% of articles on the left featured the term “non-violent,” which didn’t appear in any article titles on the right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though Trump played a prominent role during the George Floyd protests, particularly relating to his use of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/us/politics/trump-walk-lafayette-square.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>federal forces</span></a> like the National Guard, he was in retrospect a secondary player in the national upheaval over institutional racism and police brutality; he was mentioned in 9.4% of article titles from that period. By contrast, he was three times as likely to be mentioned in titles related to the Capitol Riot (31.1%). Conversely, the police were mentioned repeatedly during the George Floyd protests (40.5%), unsurprising given their centrality to the upheaval, but were mentioned with less frequency in relation to the Capitol Riot. Despite their varied interactions both <a href="https://reason.com/2021/01/07/capitol-police-failed-to-contain-a-riot-then-killed-a-woman-in-the-chaos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fighting</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/capitol-police-chief-several-officers-suspended-siege" rel="noopener" target="_blank">assisting</a> the rioters, “police” only appeared in 10.9% of all articles related to the events in DC.&nbsp;</p>

<div><p>A further way media coverage has differed is through the words that fail to appear in coverage of the events on Capitol Hill. For example, instances of looting during this summer’s protests were used by some to try to delegitimize the entire Black Lives Matter movement. In our sample about the George Floyd protests, “looting” — to "steal goods from (a place), typically during a war or riot"<span>&nbsp;—</span> was mentioned in 3.4% of article titles, slightly more than the 2.9% of articles that mentioned “riot.” By contrast, though 39.1% of article titles about January 6 included the word “riot” and even as assailants broke into the Capitol building, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackbrewster/2021/01/08/clyburns-ipad-laptop-from-pelosis-office-items-stolen-destroyed-in-capitol-attack/?sh=37d9d46d5963" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>stole government property</span></a>, and evidence was <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/jan/9/horned-man-west-va-lawmaker-man-holding-pelosis-le/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>widely published</span></a> of them doing so, there wasn’t a single mention of “looting” in the 5,057 article titles in our sample.&nbsp;</p></div>

<h4><strong>How Far Apart</strong></h4>
<p>Regardless of the words one uses to describe the political division in the U.S., it is apparent that there is some distance between the left and right on the future of the country, the optimal direction for policy, and especially how to think about the last four years. However, the words used to describe the Capitol Riot suggest more unity than one might expect, at least in terms of the media’s portrayal of what will likely be the most memorable day of the Trump administration. Media coverage from across the political spectrum is certainly in greater agreement about the character of events in DC than it was about the George Floyd protests this summer. If the desire is to rein in partisan division, coming to a set of common terms to describe the events of January 6 is a good start.</p>

        <p>Postgresql is my favorite relational database. There are a lot of cool things that Postgresql can do and one of those is to handle the authorization layer. Some people argue that putting authorization logic into the database makes the application code harder to read, and that’s actually true if there is only 1 code base connecting to a database. However, if there are more than 1 code bases communicating with a database, having a centralized authorization logic starts to make more sense. In this blog post, I am not going to discuss the pros and cons of having the authorization logic inside the database, but instead I am going to describe how I put all my authorization logic into postgresql.</p>
<p>This blog post assumes that you have prior knowledge about postgresql and SQL in general.</p>
<h2 id="basic-concepts">Basic concepts<a href="#basic-concepts" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>There are some basic concepts that we need to know before continuing</p>
<h3 id="role">Role<a href="#role" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>A role in postgresql can mean many things. It can be an user, a group of users. I usually think role as a group of users. For example, in a forum, there are normal users, moderators and admins. A new role can be created by <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createrole.html">CREATE ROLE</a>. For example</p>
<p>Then, to change the role of the current connection, simply call</p>
<h3 id="table-privileges">Table privileges<a href="#table-privileges" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>In postgresql, we can control which role can access which table. This is done via <code>GRANT</code>. For example</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>GRANT</span> <span>ALL</span> <span>ON</span> forum <span>TO</span> <span>admin</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>This allows admin to do ALL operations on <code>forum</code> tables.</p>
<h3 id="column-privileges">Column privileges<a href="#column-privileges" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>Next we have column privileges. These are more granular and for controlling how roles can access columns in a table. This is also done via <code>GRANT</code>. For example</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>GRANT</span> <span>SELECT</span>(name) <span>ON</span> forum <span>TO</span> anonymous;
</code></pre></div><p>This restricts <code>anonymous</code> role from accessing other columns in <code>forum</code> than <code>name</code>. So doing <code>SELECT * FROM forum</code> will return an error.</p>
<h3 id="row-level-security">Row-level security<a href="#row-level-security" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>This is the lowest (and most powerful) level that controls the access to a specific row. This is called <code>policy</code> in postgresql and can be created by <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createpolicy.html">CREATE POLICY</a>. However, row-level security is not enabled by default, so we need to manually enable it if we want to use it</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> forum ENABLE <span>ROW</span> <span>LEVEL</span> <span>SECURITY</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Row-level security is a bit more complicated subject. For the sake of this post, I am not going to explain every bit of the syntax but instead just show the queries and explain what they do.</p>
<p>A policy is tied to a role, and defines what that role can do (SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT) to a row. For example</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> POLICY moderator_can_update_forum <span>ON</span> forum  
<span>FOR</span> <span>UPDATE</span>
<span>WITH</span> <span>CHECK</span>(<span>current_user</span> <span>=</span> <span>'moderator'</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>This allows <code>moderator</code> to do <code>UPDATE</code> operations, all other roles can’t do that if not specifically set so. However, <code>moderator</code> still needs to be granted <code>UPDATE</code> on <code>forum</code> table</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>GRANT</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>ON</span> forum <span>TO</span> moderator;
</code></pre></div><h2 id="putting-everything-together">Putting everything together<a href="#putting-everything-together" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>I am going to design a database schema for a simple project where you can create your own store and display some products on your store. Here is the database schema</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> account (
  id SERIAL <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span>,
  username VARCHAR(<span>32</span>) <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>,
  password TEXT <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>,
  phone_number TEXT <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>,
  <span>role</span> VARCHAR(<span>16</span>) <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
);

<span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> account <span>ADD</span> <span>CONSTRAINT</span> unique_username <span>UNIQUE</span>(username);
<span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> account ENABLE <span>ROW</span> <span>LEVEL</span> <span>SECURITY</span>;

<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> store (
  id SERIAL <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span>,
  name VARCHAR(<span>64</span>) <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>,
  description TEXT,
  rank INT <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>,
  owner_id INT <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>REFERENCES</span> account(id) <span>ON</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>CASCADE</span>
);
<span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> store ENABLE <span>ROW</span> <span>LEVEL</span> <span>SECURITY</span>;

<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> product (
  id SERIAL <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span>,
  name VARCHAR(<span>128</span>) <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>,
  stock INT <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>0</span>,
  description TEXT,
  store_id INT <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>REFERENCES</span> store(id) <span>ON</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>CASCADE</span>
);
<span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> product ENABLE <span>ROW</span> <span>LEVEL</span> <span>SECURITY</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Next, we need to have some roles for the project</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>ROLE</span> super_admin;
<span>CREATE</span> <span>ROLE</span> store_owner;
<span>CREATE</span> <span>ROLE</span> normal_account;

<span>GRANT</span> normal_account <span>TO</span> store_owner;
<span>GRANT</span> store_owner <span>TO</span> super_admin;
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li><code>normal_account</code> is … just a normal account in our app</li>
<li><code>store_owner</code> is the creator of a store. So for the sake of simplicity, any normal account who created a store is automatically promoted to a <code>store_owner</code></li>
<li><code>super_admin</code> can basically do anything, it’s usually us who manages the project</li>
</ul>
<p>The last 2 <code>GRANT</code> queries establish a chain of privileges, <code>store_owner</code> can do anything that <code>normal_account</code> can do. And <code>super_admin</code> can do anything that <code>store_user</code> can do. In reality, it might be possible to have a deeper user role hierarchy.</p>
<p>Now, let’s define the permissions for each role. Let’s do it for <code>normal_account</code> and <code>store_owner</code> because <code>super_admin</code> can do absolutely anything. In addition to explicitly define the permissions for <code>super_admin</code>, I can also set <code>BYPASSRLS</code> when creating the role in order to bypass all the row-level security.</p>
<h3 id="account">account<a href="#account" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>For this table, no one can INSERT or DELETE except <code>super_admin</code> and since <code>store_owner</code> is also a <code>normal_account</code>, let’s define what a <code>normal_account</code> can do.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>GRANT</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>ON</span> account <span>TO</span> normal_account;
<span>GRANT</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>ON</span> account <span>TO</span> normal_account;
</code></pre></div><p>This allows <code>normal_account</code> to SELECT and UPDATE all columns in <code>account</code> table. But it’s not enough, we must limit it so that an account can only UPDATE their own data and not everyone else’s. For SELECT, we probably want the same limitation because leaking other people data is obviously bad.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> POLICY normal_account_can_update_their_account <span>ON</span> account
<span>FOR</span> <span>UPDATE</span>
<span>TO</span> normal_account
<span>WITH</span> <span>CHECK</span> (is_current_account(id));

<span>CREATE</span> POLICY normal_account_can_select_their_account <span>ON</span> account
<span>FOR</span> <span>SELECT</span>
<span>TO</span> normal_account
<span>USING</span> (is_current_account(id));
</code></pre></div><p>The 2 queries are straightforward, we have just created 2 policies in <code>account</code> table to control the visibility of its rows. The only new bit here is <code>is_current_account(id)</code> function. First, let’s take a look at its source code.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>OR</span> <span>REPLACE</span> <span>FUNCTION</span> is_current_account(account_id integer)
<span>RETURNS</span> BOOLEAN
<span>AS</span> <span>$$</span>
<span>DECLARE</span>
  current_account_id INT;
  owner_id INT;
<span>BEGIN</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> current_setting(<span>'auth.current_account_id'</span>, <span>true</span>)::int <span>INTO</span> current_account_id;
  <span>RETURN</span> current_account_id <span>=</span> account_id;
<span>END</span>;
<span>$$</span> <span>LANGUAGE</span> plpgsql;
</code></pre></div><p>For those who don’t like <code>plpgsql</code>, you can switch to Javascript to write stored procedures using this extension <a href="https://github.com/plv8/plv8">https://github.com/plv8/plv8</a>. For this blog post, I will stick to the default language.</p>
<p>This simple function checks if the provided value (account_id) matches the current account id stored in <code>auth.current_account_id</code> setting (Need to have some prefix, or postgresql will try to set the server config). This leads to the next point: <strong>How do we set the current account in postgresql?</strong></p>
<p>There are several ways to do that, you can have a simple function <code>login(username, password)</code> to select the account matched the provided username and compare the password, just like a regular login flow. Then if everything is correct, set the role and store the account id in <code>auth.current_account_id</code> setting through this query</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> set_config(<span>'auth.current_account_id'</span>, account.id::text, <span>true</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>Set the last parameter to <code>true</code> to apply this config for the current transaction, and <code>false</code> for the current session. This value depends on your application layer’s logic. The 2nd parameter needs to be a string because of the function signature.</p>
<p>In reality, we <strong>SHOULD AVOID</strong> setting an actual (id) value to <code>current_account_id</code>. There should be some kind of encryption so that people can’t just call <code>set_config</code> and bypass the login process.</p>
<p>Anyway, for the sake of simplicity, I will just manually set the role, and <code>current_account_id</code> to whatever I want in order to demonstrate the permission system.</p>
<p>And last but not least, we need to allow <code>super_admin</code> to do anything in <code>account</code> table, simply pass <code>true</code> to USING and WITH CHECK.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>GRANT</span> <span>INSERT</span>, <span>DELETE</span> <span>ON</span> account <span>TO</span> super_admin;
<span>CREATE</span> POLICY super_admin_can_do_anything <span>ON</span> account
<span>FOR</span> <span>ALL</span>
<span>TO</span> super_admin
<span>USING</span> (<span>true</span>)
<span>WITH</span> <span>CHECK</span> (<span>true</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>Then, there is one last thing which is to allow <code>admin</code> to use the primary key (id) sequence. Without this, <code>admin</code> won’t be able to generate the next id to be used as the primary key for the new row.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>GRANT</span> <span>ALL</span> <span>ON</span> account_id_seq <span>TO</span> super_admin;
</code></pre></div><h3 id="store">store<a href="#store" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>Our <code>store</code> table has the following schema</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> store (
  id SERIAL <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span>,
  name VARCHAR(<span>64</span>) <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>,
  description TEXT,
  rank INT <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>,
  owner_id INT <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>REFERENCES</span> account(id) <span>ON</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>CASCADE</span>
);
</code></pre></div><p>Assuming that <code>rank</code> is only visible to the <code>store_owner</code>, we have these GRANT queries. And <code>store_owner</code> can only UPDATE name and description. The column <code>rank</code> could be something we do in a background job to let store owners know how well their store is doing.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>GRANT</span> <span>SELECT</span>(id, name, description) <span>ON</span> store <span>TO</span> normal_account;
<span>GRANT</span> <span>SELECT</span>(rank, owner_id) <span>ON</span> store <span>TO</span> store_owner;
<span>GRANT</span> <span>UPDATE</span>(name, description) <span>ON</span> store <span>TO</span> store_owner;
<span>GRANT</span> <span>ALL</span> <span>ON</span> store <span>TO</span> super_admin;
<span>GRANT</span> <span>ALL</span> <span>ON</span> store_id_seq <span>TO</span> super_admin;
</code></pre></div><p>Similar to <code>account</code> table, we still need to have some policies. <code>normal_account</code> can SELECT all the stores and <code>store_owner</code> can only UPDATE their own store. Also, <code>super_admin</code> can do anything here as well.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> POLICY normal_account_can_select_everything <span>ON</span> store
<span>FOR</span> <span>SELECT</span>
<span>TO</span> normal_account
<span>USING</span> (<span>true</span>);

<span>CREATE</span> POLICY store_owner_can_update_their_store <span>ON</span> store
<span>FOR</span> <span>UPDATE</span>
<span>TO</span> store_owner
<span>WITH</span> <span>CHECK</span> (is_current_account(owner_id));

<span>CREATE</span> POLICY super_admin_can_do_anything <span>ON</span> store
<span>FOR</span> <span>ALL</span>
<span>TO</span> store_owner

</code></pre></div><p>However, there is one problem with this table, we don’t want one store owner to see the rank of another store. With our role hierarchy, <code>normal_account</code> can SELECT all the rows which means that <code>store_owner</code> can also SELECT all the rows (including the <code>rank</code> column).</p>
<p>We can’t revoke access to <code>rank</code> column because we still want the store owner to see their own rank. And postgresql doesn’t support anything to “hide” a column value.</p>
<p>The only solution I can come up with to deal with this limitation is to move <code>rank</code> to another table, say, <code>store_rank</code> and we can apply row level security there to only allow the store owner to SELECT their rank.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve been working with React since 2016 and still there isn’t a single best practice when it comes to application structure and design.</p>
<p>While there are best practices on the micro level, most teams build their own “thing” when it comes to architecture.</p>
<p>Of course, there isn’t a universal best practice that can be applied to all businesses and applications. But there are some general rules that we can follow to build a productive codebase.</p>
<p>The purpose of a software’s architecture and design is to keep it productive and flexible. Developers need to work on it effectively and modify it without rewriting its core.</p>
<p>This article is a collection of principles and rules that have proven to be effective for me and the teams I’ve worked with.</p>
<p>I outline good practices about components, application structure, testing, styling, state management and data fetching. Some of the examples are oversimplified so we can focus on the principle not on the implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Take everything here as an opinion</strong>, not an absolute. There’s more than one way to build software.</p>

<p>Favor functional components - they have a simpler syntax. No lifecycle methods, constructors or boilerplate. You can express the same logic with less characters without losing readability.</p>
<p>Unless you need an error boundary they should be your go-to approach. The mental model you need to keep in your head is a lot smaller.</p>

<h3 id="write-consistent-components">Write Consistent Components <a href="#write-consistent-components">#</a></h3>
<p>Stick to the same style for your components. Put helper functions in the same place, export the same way and follow the same naming patterns.</p>
<p>There isn’t a real benefit of one approach over the other</p>
<p>No matter if you’re exporting at the bottom of the file or directly in the definition of the component, pick one and stick to it.</p>
<h3 id="name-components">Name Components <a href="#name-components">#</a></h3>
<p>Always name your components. It helps when you’re reading an error stack trace and using the React Dev Tools.</p>
<p>It’s also easier to find where you are when developing if the component’s name is inside the file.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>form</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>...</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>form</span><span>&gt;</span></span>


<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>function</span> <span>Form</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>form</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>...</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>form</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="organize-helper-functions">Organize Helper Functions <a href="#organize-helper-functions">#</a></h3>
<p>Helper functions that don’t need to hold a closure over the components should be moved outside. The ideal place is before the component definition so the file can be readable from top to bottom.</p>
<p>That reduces the noise in the component and leaves inside only those that need to be there.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span>function</span> <span>Component</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> date <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>function</span> <span>parseDate</span><span>(</span><span>rawDate</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>


<span>function</span> <span>parseDate</span><span>(</span><span>date</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You want to keep the least amount of helper functions inside the definition. Move as many as possible outside and pass the values from state as arguments.</p>
<p>Composing your logic out of pure functions that rely only on input makes it easier to track bugs and extend.</p>

<h3 id="component-length">Component Length <a href="#component-length">#</a></h3>
<p>A React component is just a function that gets props and returns markup. They adhere to the same software design principles.</p>
<p>If a function is doing too many things, extract some of the logic and call another function. It’s the same with components - if you have too much functionality, split it in smaller components and call them instead.</p>
<p>If a part of the markup is complex, requires loops and conditionals - extract it.</p>
<p>Rely on props and callbacks for communication and data. Lines of code are not an objective measure. Think about responsibilities and abstractions instead.</p>

<p>when something needs more clarity open a code block and give additional information. The markup is a part of the logic so when you feel that something needs more clarity - provide it.</p>

<h3 id="use-error-boundaries">Use Error Boundaries <a href="#use-error-boundaries">#</a></h3>
<p>An error in one component shouldn’t bring down the entire UI. There are rare cases in which we want to take down the whole page or redirect if a critical error happens. Most of the times we’d be fine if we just hide a specific element from the screen.</p>
<p>In a function that deals with data you may have multiple try/catch statements. Put error boundaries to use not just on the top level. Wrap elements on the screen that can exist separately to avoid cascading failures.</p>

<h3 id="destructure-props">Destructure Props <a href="#destructure-props">#</a></h3>
<p>Most React components are just functions. They get props and return markup. In a normal function you use the arguments it is passed directly, so it makes sense to apply the same principle here. No need to repeat <code>props</code> everywhere.</p>
<p>A reason not to destructure the props would be to distinguish what is external and what is internal state. But in a regular function there is no distinction between arguments and variables. Don’t create unnecessary patterns.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span>function</span> <span>Input</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span> <span>value</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>props<span>.</span>value<span>}</span></span> <span>onChange</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>props<span>.</span>onChange<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>

<span>function</span> <span>Component</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> value<span>,</span> onChange <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="number-of-props">Number of Props <a href="#number-of-props">#</a></h3>
<p>The question of how many props should a component receive is a subjective one. The number of props that a component has is correlated to how much it’s doing. The more props you pass to it the more responsibilities it has.</p>
<p>A high number of props is a signal that a component is doing too much.</p>
<p>If I go above 5 props I consider whether this component should be split. In some cases, it may just need a lot of data. An input field, for example, may have a lot of props. In others it’s a sign that something needs to be extracted.</p>
<p>Note: The more props a component takes, the more reasons to rerender.</p>
<h3 id="objects-instead-of-primitives">Pass Objects Instead of Primitives <a href="#objects-instead-of-primitives">#</a></h3>
<p>One way to limit the amount of props is to pass an object instead of primitive values. Rather than passing down the user name, email and settings one by one you can group them together. This also …</p></div></div>

<p>Sci-Hub is&nbsp;since 2011&nbsp;the world´s most celebrated – and despised – «shadow library», performing&nbsp;«pirate style»&nbsp;copying and republishing&nbsp;for free of subscription based&nbsp;academic articles.&nbsp;The initiator, Alexandra Elbakyan&nbsp;(32)&nbsp;of Kazakhstan,&nbsp;has given&nbsp;a number of interviews but&nbsp;here Finnish library activist and philosopher&nbsp;Mikael Böök&nbsp;in an e-mail interview&nbsp;asks&nbsp;his own&nbsp;specific and&nbsp;very&nbsp;current&nbsp;questions.&nbsp;Just now she´s in the news with a lawsuit against her&nbsp;by&nbsp;Elsevier, Wiley&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;We also get her opinions on Plan S, on joining IFLA and on her alleged&nbsp;Russian&nbsp;communist espionage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&gt;&gt; <a href="https://bibliotekettarsaka.com/english-version/">About this blog</a></p>



<p>First Mikael explains his idea and approach for&nbsp;his&nbsp;interview:</p>



<p>It was not possible for me to meet up «physically» with Alexandra Elbakyan for this interview. Nor was it absolutely necessary. Having found her contact details on the Net, I asked her, at the beginning of December 2020, if she was willing to dialog with me about e-books, libraries and so called «shadow libraries». I told her that I had just finished a general essay (here [<a href="http://www.kaapeli.fi/book/#English"><u>http://www.kaapeli.fi/book/#English</u></a>]) on e-books in public libraries, and in the Z-Library, which is a so called «shadow library»; now I needed to consult her for another essay on the question of open access to scientific literature and Sci-Hub. Alexandra accepted to start an exchange of views with me, whereupon I formulated a first set of questions for her. She made clear that it would take some time for her to answer them. Waiting for her answers, I spent hours on the web, and reading books, trying to deepen my knowledge about the situation of the open access movement in general, and Sci-Hub in particular. This process led to the questions and answers which are published below.</p>



<p>– <em>Would you like to tell a little about yourself and your background so that people who become interested can then go, for instance, to your blog Engineuring.wordpress.com to find out more?</em></p>



<p>– I’m from Kazakhstan, and I was born in&nbsp;an&nbsp;engineering family. My grandmother was an engineering surveyor and mother a computer&nbsp;programming engineer. So I started creating websites when I was 12 years old and wrote my first computer program in Delphi language when I was 14. Back then a game named Tamagotchi was popular, it is a virtual pet that you can feed, groom and it grows. I was trying to program a Tamagotchi with artificial intelligence inside, so it will also behave as a real animal. I became gradually interested in how cognition works, so I collected a lot of e-books about neuroscience, artificial neural networks and so on. At the university I got interested in&nbsp;the&nbsp;technology of Brain-Machine Interfaces, that can connect your brain to&nbsp;a computer&nbsp;directly. So I started thinking how we can merge our consciousness into&nbsp;a computer&nbsp;using such technologies.</p>

<p>After graduating from Kazakh National Tech University&nbsp;in 2009, I applied to a PhD program in&nbsp;the United&nbsp;States to study bioengineering and such technologies, but was not accepted.&nbsp;So I remained in Kazakhstan and started working as a computer programmer.</p>



<p>I also participated in online forums for scientists. Here I learned that many researchers had a problem with access to academic journals and books, because it was very expensive. So I used my programming skills to create a Sci-Hub web application. Using that application any person can read expensive academic literature absolutely for free! The program immediately became very popular among Russian researchers and then, in the whole world. Today more than 500,000 researchers and students of science use Sci-Hub every day to get access to academic journals.</p>



<p>– <em>In your blog you write that Sci-Hub resembles a so called web scraper. Grateful if you can open the meaning of this technical term a little. And can you then outline the history of Sci-Hub and illustrate how it is being used as a webservice? For instance, it is known that over the years, there has been a certain division of labour between Sci-Hub and Library Genesis (Libgen). What do Sci-Hub and Library Genesis have in common? How do they differ?</em></p>



<p>– Sci-Hub in its essence is a web scraper: A program that downloads web pages from the Internet, processes them, extracts information from these web pages, and saves some information in the database. We have those paid websites with academic journals that many researchers are unable to afford. So what Sci-Hub does in its core, it downloads information from these paid websites, and then provides this information for free to the users.</p>



<p>So how exactly&nbsp;does&nbsp;Sci-Hub download information from paid websites? Some universities are subscribed to these websites. So when you open such&nbsp;a&nbsp;website from the university, it will provide all information for free. Next, all universities provide&nbsp;<em>proxy servers</em>. Using such&nbsp;a&nbsp;proxy server a student or a professor can open these websites&nbsp;<em>as if</em>they open&nbsp;it&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;university, while being at home. See? Sci-Hub collects many passwords from students and professors. Then it uses proxy servers to access the websites&nbsp;<em>as if</em>&nbsp;they are accessed from universities that have subscriptions.&nbsp;Using a proxy to access the website, Sci-Hub web scraper downloads paid academic journals and provides them to its users for free.</p>

<p>That is the core of Sci-Hub: a&nbsp;web scraper<em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>working through&nbsp;password-protected&nbsp;<em>proxy servers</em>.</p>



<p>There is a widespread&nbsp;<em>lie</em>&nbsp;that Sci-Hub is a search engine while in fact it never had any search function at all.&nbsp;What&nbsp;a&nbsp;search engine such as Google does,&nbsp;is&nbsp;it gets a bunch of keywords from users, then it surveys web pages on the Internet, looking for such keywords. If some web page contains such keywords, it is displayed to the user. There is no similarities to Sci-Hub.&nbsp;Yes, search engines also&nbsp;contain&nbsp;web scrapers to download web pages from the whole Internet. Then they extract keywords from these web pages and store them in database. When&nbsp;a&nbsp;user is looking for some keyword,&nbsp;a&nbsp;search engine checks&nbsp;its database for matching&nbsp;web pages.&nbsp;And sometimes you can look up for free versions of academic journals using&nbsp;a&nbsp;search engine such as Google.&nbsp;But that is&nbsp;very&nbsp;different from what Sci-Hub does.</p>



<p>Library Genesis is another website that is different from Sci-Hub. Basically it is a huge database that stores millions of academic ebooks. It exists, as far as I know, from 2007 or 2008, and contains also a search engine to look up books in that database.</p>



<p>I created Sci-Hub to access academic journals in 2011 and after that&nbsp;Library Genesis had an idea to store academic journals in their database too, not only books.&nbsp;So they asked me if they&nbsp;could&nbsp;save research articles that Sci-Hub downloads in their database, and we started collaborating. At the beginning Sci-Hub worked without any database at all. Then it started using LibGen database to save the articles, so there will be no need to download them again every time they&nbsp;are&nbsp;requested.</p>



<p>Starting from 2014-2015 Sci-Hub has its own databases and it does not rely on LibGen, but still all new articles downloaded by Sci-Hub are uploaded to LibGen.</p>



<p>So the difference between Sci-Hub and LibGen is that Sci-Hub is primarily an article-download engine, while LibGen is a database without an integrated algorithm to download new articles.</p>



<p>– <em>Sci-Hub and Libgen are often mentioned among the so called ‘shadow libraries’ (in the Wikipedia, for instance, and in the 2018 book «Shadow Libraries» edited by Joe Karaganis.) Then there is yet another ‘shadow library’ which I myself stumbled upon and started to explorate even before I had heard about Libgen. I am surprised that almost nobody talks about the Z-Library. What do you know about that one? (I for one know practically nothing except that it is big, seemingly Moscow-based and maintained on a server in China.) By the way, is the epithet ‘shadow library’ an apt description of a service like Sci-Hub which gives the researchers ‘open access’ to the articles of their colleagues?</em></p>



<p>I remember there&nbsp;were&nbsp;some mistakes in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Sci-Hub description in that «Shadow Libraries» book by Karaganis, but I do not remember exactly which mistakes. I was very angry when I read the book:&nbsp;They could&nbsp;have&nbsp;asked&nbsp;me to proof-read their chapter about Sci-Hub before publishing, but they didn´t!</p>

<p>As far as Z-Library is concerned, I know that is a website that basically mirrors Library Genesis books database, including the database of Sci-Hub articles.</p>



<p>Why nobody talks about Z-Library and everyone talks about Sci-Hub? Sometimes people even have conspiracy theories why Sci-Hub got such fame and recognition. What can I say? Sci-Hub is actually the&nbsp;<em>first</em>&nbsp;website to provide free access to academic journals on a massive scale. Before Sci-Hub there existed websites such as Gigapedia or library.nu, Library Genesis and others that provided academic&nbsp;<em>books</em>&nbsp;for free, but not&nbsp;<em>journal articles</em>. Sci-Hub became the&nbsp;<em>first</em>&nbsp;website to target that academic journals problem!</p>



<p>For a long time the existence of Sci-Hub was censored in the media. Sci-Hub started in 2011 and immediately became popular among researchers but… even in 2015 articles discussing the problem of access to academic journals did not mention Sci-Hub!</p>



<p>Then in 2015 the lawsuit from Elsevier came, that included both Sci-Hub, Library Genesis and its mirrors such as Z-Library. A website named TorrentFreak published a short article about the lawsuit, and it listed Sci-Hub… as a mirror of Library Genesis! I read the article and became extremely angry. Then I contacted the journalist to correct the mistake, and they …</p></div></div>

		<p>We bought a new house last year and as I was moving my old Apple IIe computer from my old attic over to my new attic, I thought it would be fun to hook it up and see if it still worked.&nbsp; To make a long story short … it worked!&nbsp; (Scroll down to see some pictures and even a video clip of my working Apple IIe.)</p>
<p><strong>To make a long story even longer … here are all the gory and geeky details:</strong></p>
<p>Back in 1983, when I was only 13 years old and in 8th grade in Central Illinois, my parents bought me an Apple IIe computer for Christmas.&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time I had no computer training but I think there were a couple of APPLE II computers in my school.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-scaled.jpg"><img src="http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-400x303.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="303" srcset="http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-400x303.jpg 400w, http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-1024x775.jpg 1024w, http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-768x581.jpg 768w, http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-1536x1162.jpg 1536w, http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-2048x1550.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></a></p>
<p>Well, now that I look at the photo of my sister and I unwrapping it, I guess it was technically a gift for the both of us.&nbsp; But I think we both knew it was really mine!&nbsp; 🙂</p>
<p>Here’s an old and humorous Apple II commercial:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/05M80HHNB6s?rel=0" width="480" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Purchase Details:</strong></p>
<p>The cost of my Apple IIe computer in November of 1983 was $995 plus $115 for the standard green phosphor monitor for a grand total of $1,165 including 5% sales tax.&nbsp; That translates to nearly $2,700 in 2012 dollars.&nbsp; Yes, that’s a lot of money for a 13 year old kid’s Christmas present.&nbsp; The Apple IIe had only been on the market for less than a year when I got mine so it was not extremely popular yet. To hook it up to your own television, you would pay $70 for a modulator rather than $115 for the green monitor, but the resolution would not be as sharp on a television screen as it was on the computer monitor.&nbsp; We eventually did get the TV modulator, though, so I could use the computer in full color.&nbsp; Full color for an Apple IIe was only 15 colors, by the way.</p>
<p>My parents bought the computer from Wallace Micro-Mart on University Street in Peoria, Illinois.&nbsp; I believe the salesman there, who was listed as “Howell” on the hand written carbon receipt, lived in our same home town.&nbsp; At the bottom of the receipt it says that “Wallace has been serving the Peoria Community for over 10 years”.</p>
<p>I google’d Wallace Micro-Mart and all I found was this old commercial for an Apple Lisa computer:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3R8fArhOWso?rel=0" width="480" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Geeky Specs:</strong></p>
<p>The Apple IIe came with 64KB of memory standard, but it was expandable to 1 Megabyte and also had lots of expansion slots for various accessories.&nbsp; It ran at a screaming 1 Megahertz and had an 8 bit data bus.&nbsp; It had 2 text display modes and 4 graphics display modes.&nbsp; The text modes were 40 or 80 columns at 24 lines.&nbsp; The graphics modes were 40×48 or 80×48 block low resolution modes and 280×192 or 560×192 pixel high resolution modes.&nbsp; For comparison, the Apple IIe high res graphics modes were about the same pixel resolution as your most common cell phones used in the year 2005 … and those old cell phones definitely had way more memory than the Apple IIe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Apple IIe contained Applesoft BASIC in ROM and booted into it if no floppy disk was found during boot.</p>
<p><strong>Unboxed Nearly 30 Years Later:</strong></p>
<p>Here is a photo of the computer in 2011 when I unboxed it during the move.&nbsp; It is basically a big case containing a keyboard, power supply, motherboard and that’s about it.&nbsp; It did not come with a mouse, nor did any of the Apple software support a mouse for the Apple II series of computers.&nbsp; I believe the Apple IIe came with one floppy drive and I think we bought the second one later.</p>
<p>The keys on the keyboard had some serious friction resistance and the keys were not very easy to push down.&nbsp; I think the key wiggle tolerances were pretty tight and the plastic-to-plastic friction caused quite a bit of resistance if you didn’t push the keys in the exact proper direction.&nbsp; Typing on this keyboard was seriously loud.&nbsp; Click, click, click!</p>
<p>There were some unique keys on these old Apple keyboards.&nbsp; Notice the outlined apple key which was called the open-apple and the solid white apple key which was called the closed-apple or solid-apple.&nbsp; The key sequence of simultaneous Control-OpenApple-Reset would reboot the machine immediately.&nbsp; Control-ClosedApple-Reset would enter BIOS setup before rebooting.&nbsp; Control-ClosedApple-OpenApple-Reset would perform a self test during reboot.&nbsp; Those are some crazy key sequences.</p>
<p>(Click on any photo to see it in full resolution.)</p>

<p>Here is the green phosphor “Monitor II”, as Apple called it.&nbsp; It had one single RCA style input connector and that’s it.&nbsp; No audio jacks, no output jacks, nothing.&nbsp; This thing was pretty old school and very basic.&nbsp; The serial number on this monitor is actually written by hand.&nbsp; The one cool feature was that the actual glass CRT was mounted on an axis that tilted up and down for a more direct viewing angle.&nbsp; The user just pushed on the darker green plastic frame around the glass CRT to tilt the glass up and down.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/02" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/02.JPG?m=1440971774" alt="" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>Here is what the motherboard looks like inside the case.&nbsp; The lid was basically held down with a couple of hard plastic velcro type devices.&nbsp; There are 8 expansion slots and I was using four of them when I packed mine up for storage back in the late 80s.</p>
<p>The tiny card on the far left is the 80 column card and it is plugged into the auxiliary slot.&nbsp; This card just let the computer display 80 columns rather than the default 40 columns.&nbsp; This card also added more memory to the computer.</p>
<p>The long card on the left in slot 1 is the parallel interface card.&nbsp; It sure took a lot of electronics to interface to a parallel printer back then!</p>
<p>The short card in the middle in slot 4 is a Covox sound card.&nbsp; This card intercepted the sound going from the motherboard (yellow and red wires ) to the built-in speaker (black wires).&nbsp; The built-in speaker is mounted under the keyboard pointing straight down.&nbsp; This Covox sound card also had a headphone jack mounted directly on the card itself.&nbsp; I thought that was terribly inconvenient, so I de-soldered it from the card and mounted it into the plastic hole cover on the back of the computer.&nbsp; The brown wires are connecting the card to the headphone jack.&nbsp; I was pretty handy with a soldering iron, even when I was young.&nbsp; 🙂</p>
<p>The medium length card on the right in slot 6 is the floppy disk drive controller.&nbsp; Both disk drives are connected to that card using standard flat ribbon cables and nothing else.&nbsp; PC users are used to connecting power cables separately from data cables, but the power and data are both in these ribbon cables.&nbsp; Convenient … and also just a little scary.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/3.JPG?m=1440971950" alt="" width="480" height="640"></a></p>
<p>This is a 5 and a quarter inch magnetic floppy disk that holds the operating system.&nbsp; Do you remember these floppy disks?&nbsp; Some floppy disks were double sided, so you could flip them over and use the other side and get twice the data onto them.&nbsp; You had to punch out a notch in a specific place on the disk in order to make it read-only.&nbsp; Then you had to put a sticker over that hole in order to write to it again.&nbsp; Computer stores sold special notch cutters, but most of us users just used a standard hole punch numerous times until we got the notch created in the right place in order to open up the microswitch in the disk drive.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/4.JPG?m=1440971830" alt="" width="480" height="640"></a></p>
<p>30 years ago, I loved that Apple gave stickers away with their hardware and they still do it today and I still love it!&nbsp; This was a folder containing the receipt and some manuals and it also contained some really cool full color apple logo decals.&nbsp; I never used the decals.&nbsp; I just checked EBay and people are selling these vintage rainbow Apple stickers for 20 bucks each!&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; I guess they are a true collectors item now that they are 30 years old.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/5.JPG?m=1440971903" alt="" width="480" height="640"></a></p>
<p>The owners manual was spiral bound.&nbsp; It took you though the internals for a computer and then walked you through the DOS command line commands and also introduced you to Applesoft BASIC programming.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/6.JPG?m=1440971927" alt="" width="480" height="640"></a></p>
<p>Ah, the good old dot matrix printer.&nbsp; Man, these things were loud.&nbsp; And how annoying was it to keep these things feeding the paper properly?&nbsp; These things were part typewriter and part printer.&nbsp; When somebody invented laserjets, we never looked back, did we?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/10.JPG?m=1440971781" alt="" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>I actually still had an un-opened ribbon for the dot matrix printer.&nbsp; It probably dried out a year after I packed this thing up and went to college, though.&nbsp; I don’t remember how much these ribbons cost, but I do remember trying to squeeze every last drop of ink out of them.&nbsp; We used to reuse them multiple times and some people went as far as trying to re-ink them.&nbsp; I guess we still do the same thing today with our inkjet cartridges and our toner cartridges, though.&nbsp; The more things change, the more they stay the same!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/11.JPG?m=1440971788" alt="" width="480" height="640"></a></p>
<p>Here is a photo of the command line after one of my personal boot disks had been booted up.&nbsp; This was just a disk that had some small Applesoft BASIC programs on it.&nbsp; This particular program printed some text to the screen and exited.&nbsp; Very much beginner stuff.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/20.JPG?m=1440971794" alt="" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>If you typed CATALOG from the command line, the computer would show you the list of files on the floppy disk.&nbsp; File type (A=Applesoft BASIC, B=Binary, I=Integer Basic, T=Text) and file size (disk sectors) and file name were shown.&nbsp; Notice that file names can have spaces.&nbsp; UNIX did not allow this initially and neither did the early DOS for PCs, but Apple did.&nbsp; Now pretty much every OS does allow it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/21.JPG?m=1440971803" alt="" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>This image shows a listing of a small Applesoft BASIC program.&nbsp; It was written on the command line, line for line, then it was tested and if it worked, it was written to the disk as a file.&nbsp; In Applesoft BASIC you did not start with an empty file on disk and write characters to that file.&nbsp; You created your program directly in the computer’s memory and copied it to disk later.&nbsp; There was no plain text editor app that I’m aware of.&nbsp; No computer manufacturer does that anymore, for good reasons.</p>
<p>In this particular program, it draws some boxes on the screen with the HPLOT commands.&nbsp; Then it creates an artificial delay using the old school empty for/next loop.&nbsp; Then it repeats the box drawing sequence three times with a for/next loop, part of which has scrolled off the screen.&nbsp; After three cycles of the box drawing sequence, it runs a subroutine, which is not necessary in this case since it is only called once.&nbsp; But …</p></div></div>

<p>The credit for the title goes to Jeff Moser and his excellent <a href="http://www.moserware.com/2008/02/does-your-code-pass-turkey-test.html">post</a> which he authored in 2008. He basically discussed the dangers of improper localization and took a clever approach, stating «“The Turkey Test.” It’s very simple: will your code work properly on a person’s machine in or around the country of Turkey?”». The Turkish alphabet is based on Latin letters but there are few interesting properties of the Turkish alphabet such that
Jeff proposes if your code works fine in Turkish culture, then chances are good it is resilient to possible localization problems in other cultures using the Latin alphabet. Perhaps this is a bit overstatement as there are too many different languages and alphabets. However, unless we have a specific focus in a particular language or have dedicated people working on each language, in practice it’s next to impossible to have bug-free localization in our applications. In that aspect, I believe the Turkey test is a low effort way to do basic
smoke test on localization for your development process.</p>

<!--more--></p>

<p>In his post, Jeff discusses the localization problems mostly from a .NET point of view. In this post, however, I will try to follow Jeff’s footprints but from a JavaScript point of view.</p>

<h2 id="dotted-and-dotless-i">Dotted and dotless I</h2>

<p>Well, the obvious question is why “Turkey”? One of the main reasons to use the Turkish alphabet for testing is that that the Turkish alphabet has two “I” letters. One with a dot and one without.
Namely the upper case  “I” and “İ and lower case “ı” and “i”. And yet there is even a dedicated Wikipedia [article] about it (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotted_and_dotless_I).</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-23-Does-your-code-pass-the-Turkey-test/i-i.png" alt="i-i"></p>

<p>The challenge with these “I”s usually occurs when you try to do a case insensitive equality comparison. As a Turkish, I have been burned very badly because of “I” issues.</p>

<h2 id="problems-with-oracle-fixed-a-long-time-ago">Problems with Oracle (fixed a long time ago)</h2>

<p>One particular case I remember is I was developing an application for a bank. We had done extensive testing of the application in the local development environment.
But once we deployed the application to the bank’s prod machines, it immediately crashed.</p>

<p>After 13 hours of investigation (at that time my debugging skills wasn’t so sharp so I mostly relied on the logs), I realized my query was in the form of
“select description from …” and Oracle database will always capitalize the column names in its results returning a column with “DESCRIPTION”. 
The developers of ODP.NET were aware of this inconsistency so as a workaround they were calling ToUpper to match the column names from your query. However,
if your code runs within Turkish culture then <strong>ToUpper</strong> call will transform the column name to “DESCRİPTİON” and boom! your code would bail out with a cryptic exception.
Luckily only 3 years later Oracle has fixed the issue by using <strong>ToUpperInvariant</strong> instead of <strong>ToUpper</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-23-Does-your-code-pass-the-Turkey-test/oracle.png" alt="Turkey-Test"></p>

<h2 id="javascript-world">JavaScript world</h2>

<p>Having reiterated the problem on .NET, let’s explore the situation with the browsers. The browsers take the current culture from the operating system on macOS
and Linux. And on windows depending on the browser they may obey “preferred language” settings.  The following one-liner should help you to get the current culture of the browser:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>getLanguage</span> <span>=</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>userLanguage</span> 
  <span>||</span> <span>(</span><span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>languages</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>languages</span><span>.</span><span>length</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>languages</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>])</span> 
  <span>||</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>language</span> <span>||</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>browserLanguage</span> <span>||</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>systemLanguage</span> <span>||</span> <span>'</span><span>en</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Perhaps one of the easiest ways to make case-insensitive but 
safe comparisons are to use ToLocalUpperCase and ToLocalLowerCase:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>city</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>istanbul</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>

<p>Notice the interesting dot on top of the i for lower-case en-us transformation. I have no idea what it is.</p>

<h2 id="javascript-internationalization-objects">JavaScript Internationalization objects</h2>

<p>JavaScript also offers several built-in objects for internationalization.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Intl</li>
  <li>Intl.Collator</li>
  <li>Intl.DateTimeFormat</li>
  <li>Intl.ListFormat</li>
  <li>Intl.NumberFormat</li>
  <li>Intl.PluralRules</li>
  <li>Intl.RelativeTimeFormat</li>
  <li>Intl.Locale</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl">mdn</a></p>

<p>Although I appreciate the effort, I personally find these APIs relatively limited. The internationalization API extends towards interesting problems like pluralization,
however, if you review the API, it’s mostly geared towards formatting and displaying but relatively weak when it comes to parsing. First, let’s visit our original
problem. Is there another API we could compare “İSTANBUL” with “istanbul” case-insensitively and find them equal?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>İSTANBUL</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>

<p>It seems to work expectedly.  What about the dotless I case?
Let’s compare ‘IĞDIR’ and ‘ığdır’ which are considered equal in Turkish case-insensitively.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>IĞDIR</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>

<p>Notice here you must set the culture to ‘tr’ otherwise it won’t work.</p>

<h2 id="date-and-time">Date and Time</h2>
<p>Most languages have different formats for dates so if we have <strong>05/01/2021</strong> does it mean January 5 or May 5?. Some people would argue we should use 
<strong>2021-05-01</strong> but then your users will complain. How about 01 MAY 2021, this is good but then you have to localize MAY. So pick your poison. To make things more complicated, languages like Turkish use “.” instead of “/” as a date separator.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is no built-in way to parse such strings to convert JavaScript date objects. You have to rely on external libs like moment.js and
there goes another 75 kb to your bundle.</p>

<p>Finally, I should add that, <strong>1 PM</strong> is shown as <strong>13.00</strong> in Turkish culture. That’s one more thing you should consider.</p>

<h2 id="numbers">Numbers</h2>

<p>Well, it’s a well-known fact that different languages use different symbols for thousands and decimals separators. But being uncareful with number localization has dire consequences. In Turkish thousands is split by dot “.” and for the decimal separator “,” is used. For example
<em>1.234,56</em> is one thousand two hundred thirty-four point fifty-six. In .NET if you try parsing in Turkish culture</p>



<p>What do you think the output will be? Well, it is <strong>1234</strong> as the .NET parser completely ignores the thousands separator even if that wasn’t your intention.
What about the situation in JavaScript? You are completely on your own. parseFloat is just using en-US culture and that’s fixed.</p>

<p>That’s not all. How many digits are there? 10 you say? <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040309-00/?p=40333">Raymond Chen disagrees</a> 
Well at least from a .NET standpoint Arabic digits are also considered as digits. In JavaScript, you are on your own again.</p>

<h2 id="currency">Currency</h2>
<p>Well, the simple fact is in Turkish and many other languages the currency symbol is written after the numeric value not before as in <strong>100$</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="percentage-symbol">Percentage symbol</h2>

<p>In Turkish, the percentage symbol comes before e.g <strong>%50</strong></p>

<h2 id="other-alphabets">Other alphabets</h2>

<p>Let’s see some peculiarities with other Alphabets. One might think “Z” is probably the last letter in Latin alphabets. Enter the nordic languages</p>

<p>Danish and Norwegian Alphabets:
A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z	Æ	Ø	Å</p>

<p>As you can see there are three letters coming after Z.</p>

<p>In the Icelandic alphabet, Z is obsoleted!!!</p>

<p>Ok, but at least we cans say Z is the last letter if we consider plain English letters. Unfortunately no. Here’s the Estonian alphabet:</p>

<p>A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, Š, Z, Ž, T, U, V, Õ, Ä, Ö, Ü.</p>

<p>Some alphabets like Dutch has digraphs like “IJ” which is sometimes considered a single letter. Some fun facts taken from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IJ_(digraph)">wikipedia article</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In Dutch primary schools, ij used to be taught as being the 25th letter of the alphabet, and some primary school writing materials list ‘ij’ as the 25th letter of the alphabet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a word starting with IJ is capitalised, the entire digraph is capitalised: IJsselmeer, IJmuiden.[5]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On mechanical Dutch typewriters, there is a key that produces ‘ij’ (in a single letterspace, located directly to the right of the L). However, this is not the case on modern computer keyboards.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In word puzzles, ij often fills one square.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And here’s the Nigerian alphabet:</p>

<p>Upper case	A	B	Ɓ	C	D	Ɗ	E	Ǝ	Ẹ	F	G</p>

<p>Lower case	a	b	ɓ	c	d	ɗ	e	ǝ	ẹ	f	g</p>

<p>Upper case	H	I	Ị	J	K	Ƙ	L	M	N	O	Ọ</p>

<p>Lower case	h	i	ị	j	k	ƙ	l	m	n	o	ọ</p>

<p>Upper case	P	R	S	Ṣ	T	U	Ụ	V	W	Y	Z</p>

<p>Lower case	p	r	s	ṣ	t	u	ụ	v	w	y	z</p>

<p>Not only Nigerian alphabet has 3 E letters but they have an I with dot like Turkish but the dot is at the bottom.</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-23-Does-your-code-pass-the-Turkey-test/nigeria.png" alt="nigerian-keyboard"></p>

<p>If you wonder things can go more interesting than this, ladies and gentleman, I present you Hungarian keyboard:</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-23-Does-your-code-pass-the-Turkey-test/hungary.png" alt="hungarian-keyboard"></p>

<p>My non-elven eyes see there are 4 U’s and 4 O’s with different accents in the Hungarian keyboard most of them being at right hand side :)</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Despite its widespread use, I have a feeling that JavaScript is not on par with backend languages like .NET when it comes to localization capabilities. 
What is the solution? You probably have to rely on third-party libraries. An alternative route might be to use Blazor which brings .NET Runtime into the browser.
That way you can get the benefit of all the Globalization goodies of .NET but your app can still reside in the browser. Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments section.</p>

How to make it more sustainable?</p><div><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/iter_fusion_reactor_plasma.jpg" alt="Figure 1: Inside the Korean tokamak KSTAR (NFRI)"><figcaption><p>Figure 1: Inside the Korean tokamak <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KSTAR">KSTAR</a> (NFRI)</p></figcaption></figure><p>With corporations like Microsoft, Oracle, and Google truly reinventing
themselves to adapt to an open source world, and typical open source
projects moving towards—oftentimes centralized—governance models, the
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/">Cathedral–Bazaar</a> dichotomy feels increasingly less relevant.</p><p>It was met with
<a href="https://firstmonday.org/article/view/708/618">criticism</a>
even back in the 90s.</p><p>While being an entertaining piece of history with useful takeaways, its
most important achievement was arguably helping create a sense of identity
for hacker culture via the revolutionary Open Source movement, and
promoting the value of the Internet for software development.</p><p>In the Cathedral-Bazaar continuum, contemporary projects like Kubernetes,
Chromium, and VSCode are <i>fusion reactors</i>.</p><p>They have the backing of heavily invested companies with virtually infinite
capital, who are able to staff highly competent teams that not only work
full-time on these projects, but also have enough personpower to maximally
leverage the benefits brought by a gigantic user base.</p><p>Like with fusion power, they seem to be able to leverage a high amount of
energy to generate even more.</p><p>Sometimes, their user base includes <i>other</i> organizations with
endless resources: by means of its success, VSCode is getting
<a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2019/11/21/fb-vs-code.aspx">sizable contributions</a> from Facebook, for example.</p><p>In contrast, the vast majority of open source projects depend almost
exclusively on decentralized volunteer efforts from people sacrificing time
out of their busy schedules and lives to move things forward.</p><p>And yet, projects following this style of development can end up becoming
backbones of modern computing:</p><blockquote><p>The OpenSSL project has been around since 1998. Since the project is open
source, it is an informal group comprised primarily of about a dozen
members throughout the world, most of whom have day jobs, and some of whom
work on a volunteer basis. Being open source, the OpenSSL project’s code
has always been public facing. Any person could download it and modify it
or implement it in their own software.</p><p>[…]</p><p>The fascinating, mind-boggling fact here is that you have this critical
piece of network infrastructure that really runs a large part of the
internet, and there’s basically one guy working on it full time.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/articles/ssl-heartbleed">Steve Marquess in “It’s Not A Fun Week To Work at OpenSSL, The Mostly
Volunteer Project Responsible for the Heartbleed Bug”, (2014)</a></p></blockquote><p>Heartbleed is a symptom of an ever-existing problem: corporations profit
massively by leveraging typically under-resourced open source projects
while not giving back proportionally, or (most commonly) at all; either
with money or people.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/xkcd_load_bearing_open_source.png" alt="Figure 2: &amp;ldquo;Load-Bearing Internet People&amp;rdquo;"><figcaption><p>Figure 2: <a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/">“Load-Bearing Internet People”</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>After Heartbleed the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Infrastructure_Initiative">Core Infrastructure Initiative</a>
was created to support software essential to the "functioning of the
Internet and other major information systems".</p><p>Less critical software like Emacs also follows this decentralized
development style, and similarly, lacks resources.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>So if Emacs wants to compete with these tools then it has to have
seamless, context aware code completion and refactoring support, and GNU
tools has to provide Emacs the necessary information to implement these
features.</p></blockquote><p>I agree. But to have that, the only way is to have motivated volunteers
step forward and work on these features. Otherwise we will never have them.</p><p>Right now, no one is working on that, though everyone is talking. [T]he
same as with weather.</p><p>— <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-10/msg00646.html">Eli Zaretskii in “Re: IDE” (2014)</a></p></blockquote><p>One way to incentivize contributions is by funding developers. Some (most?)
open source contributors would gladly take income to fund their work.</p><blockquote><p>Long-term my big dream has always been to accumulate enough backing to be
able to work full-time on open-source projects, but whether I’ll achieve
this dream or not is entirely up to you.</p><p>— <a href="https://emacsredux.com/blog/2020/09/13/patronage-revisited/">Bozhidar Batsov in “Patronage Revisited” (2020)</a></p></blockquote><p>While others feel that accepting funding would degrade their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:%5FThe%5FSurprising%5FTruth%5FAbout%5FWhat%5FMotivates%5FUs">intrinsic
motivation</a> to contribute.</p><blockquote><p>I can’t speak for all FLOSS developers, but I can speak for myself: I don’t
want monetary rewarding from users. Mainly for the reason, that I don’t
want to change the relationship with my users. Currently it is mostly a
team attitude, we’re working together to solve the problem. And there is
also no legal obligation for me to work on something I don’t like.</p><p>If I accepted contributions I think many users would get a “but I paid for
that, so do what I want” attitude. I definitely don’t want that. I do FLOSS
in my free time to do something that matters, and for my personal
fulfillment, not for money.</p><p>It will also get harder to do the right thing (in contrary to doing what
the users want) since the users can stop the payments.</p><p>So, no payments for me, thanks.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/6pjbn0/sustainable%5Femacs%5Fdevelopment%5Fsome%5Fthoughts%5Fand/">cjk101010 in “Sustainable Emacs development - some thoughts and
analysis” (2017)</a></p></blockquote><p>Which is fair: with compensation comes responsibility, timelines,
expectations, and things can get complicated. From the point of view of the
project, there doesn’t seem to be a conflict: capture funding to enable those
who need (or want) it, while still empowering those who don’t, to contribute
on their own terms.</p><p>Not everyone is in a position to spend unpaid time on open source,
especially consistently. “Free” time <a href="https://www.rightattitudes.com/2017/08/08/opportunity-cost/">isn’t free</a>—<em>it costs life</em>. By
funding work, a project might get to see contributions from talented folks
passionate about it who wouldn’t be able to volunteer their time.</p><p>And sometimes, the reason why your PR isn't getting immediate attention
is that the maintainer is busy literally
<a href="https://github.com/fre5h/DoctrineEnumBundle/pull/12#issuecomment-33023169">fighting</a>
a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_of_Dignity">revolution</a>.</p><p>For Emacs specifically, one problem is that there’s no clear way of funding
“Emacs”. Sending money to the FSF doesn’t guarantee that it will fund Emacs
development. <em>Even if there was</em> a way of “funding Emacs”, the Emacs
community—like many things in life—seems to be roughly divided in two
sides: those who prioritize <em><a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">freedom</a></em>, and those who prioritize <em>progress</em>. So
one would potentially want to fund one side or the other, depending on their
values.</p><p>In the excellent “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0578675862/">Working in Public</a>: The Making and Maintenance of Open
Source Software”, Nadia Eghbal calls attention to a shift in how
individuals support open source. Similarly to platforms like Twitch, more
and more people are funding creators directly instead of projects, as a way
of “incentivizing the ongoing creation of creative work” from developers
who produce things that are in their interests.</p><p>Maintainers of popular Emacs packages, for example, have their own <a href="https://github.com/tarsius/elisp-maintainers">separate
streams of patronage</a>, which receive varying levels of support depending on
their popularity and the value added by what they create.</p><p>For efforts that involve multiple people, like maintaining and evolving
Emacs itself, services like <a href="https://opencollective.com/">Open Collective</a> could be of great assistance by
helping on three fronts:</p><ol><li>providing a legal banking entity</li><li>recurrently collecting funds from individuals and companies</li><li>distributing funds to contributors</li></ol><p>Funds can be transparently collected, and dispersed for specific contract
work, infrastructure costs, and even developer salaries. Take for example
the <a href="https://opencollective.com/babel">Babel</a> project, which draws in enough recurrent income to finance
multiple contractors and a full-time developer earning a San Francisco
salary. An Emacs Open Collective could not only be an answer to “how can I
fund Emacs development?” but also a way to financially support developers
working on it.</p><p>The Clojure community seems to be doing an excellent job at not only
<a href="https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/q4-2020-funding-announcement/">funding</a>
efforts that are making the whole Clojure ecosystem
better but also at surveying and
<a href="https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/q3-2020-survey-results/">responding</a>
accordingly to user
feedback.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors">GitHub Sponsors</a> is another great example of developer empowerment. With it,
not only does GitHub equip people to:</p><ul><li>be more productive by providing great code hosting, bug tracking, wiki,
code reviewing and merging, project management, continuous integration,
documentation, artifact hosting, etc.</li><li>have a broader impact by giving projects more visibility and standardized
workflows that are familiar to others already on the platform</li></ul><p>It also makes it possible for its <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">40 million users</a> to frictionlessly fund
work on open source, and for a large number of maintainers to be
conveniently compensated for their labor. I just started sponsoring someone
with literally two clicks!</p><p>The power of platforms can’t be understated.</p><p>Whether you like GitHub or not, it’s undeniable that it has, and continues
to revolutionize Open Source, simply by providing a significantly better
and unified experience for all aspects of building software.</p><div><p>When there are people making over
<a href="https://changelog.com/posts/i-just-hit-100000-per-year-on-github-sponsors">100k/year</a>
on GitHub Sponsors, you better have a great reason to <b>not</b> try to
<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/neovim">take advantage</a>
of it.</p><p>In the case of Emacs, the reason is <i>freedom</i>.</p></div><p>I wouldn’t mind if Emacs development moved to GitHub, but <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/repo-criteria-evaluation.en.html">I don’t think
it’s ever going to happen</a>. Maybe for good reason: GitHub is backed by a
for-profit corporation and is far from perfect, both in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906213/github-ice-microsoft-software-email-contract-immigration-nonprofit-donation">moral</a> and <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc">technical</a>
terms. It might be a great tool today, but being a proprietary platform,
its users are at their complete mercy.</p><p>I should point out that from my perspective GitHub has been for the
most part a force for
<a href="https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/">good</a>.</p><p>It would be great if main development at least moved from a
mailing-list-driven process to a modern <em>forge</em> style of contribution. It
<a href="https://emba.gnu.org/emacs/emacs">seems that it <em>might</em></a>, but whether or not it will is still <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/28152">unclear</a>.</p><p>In the same way that corporations extract value out of open source, open
source projects should as much as possible leverage “energy” generated by
corporations. In this new open source world, companies have their workforce
contributing millions of person-hours to projects that benefit everyone.
LLVM equips people to build programming languages. LSP gives people potent
software development capabilities. Rails empowers people to build powerful
web applications.</p><blockquote><p>More than 3,000 people have committed man-decades, maybe even
man-centuries, of work for free. Buying all that effort at market rates
would have been hundreds of millions of dollars. Who would have been able

                    Preface to the Wolfpack Edition

This is Geoff Cashman's venerable User's Guide to Empire.  It was written
in 1991, and Empire has evolved quite a bit since then.  Nevertheless, many
players have found it useful through the years, so here it is.  We
reproduce it verbatim except for this preface and corrections of a few
editing mistakes.

				Preface

This guide's intended audience is the beginning player and those players
who have played a game or three and would like to have some insight on some
more subtle aspects of the game.  Some experienced players may find some 
benefit from reading this guide as well.  While you may feel you are an
expert, it is always possible to learn.  Nothing in this guide is intended 
to be difficult to understand, and every effort has been made to make this
guide an easy learning tool. 
				   
This publication is current to Berkeley version 1.1 patch level 5

				Foreword

It has been over a year now since I first sat down and thought in a serious
way about writing this guide.  It has been a long trip with many interesting
turns and developments.  When I first started, the version of Empire that
this guide has ultimately been written for had not yet been released.  Now,
with this project nearing release I find that yet another new version of
Empire is coming out.  I look on in near despair as I realize that this guide
may very well soon be outdated.  Nevertheless, I feel compelled to release
this information in what might be considered a final form.  

However, I hope that this is not the final form.  With new versions of
Empire coming out in the very near future I hope that some other potential
author steps forward and takes up the banner of educating the new player. 
I caution you though that such a work as this takes quite an effort. 

To the reader and any critics or even cynics that might be reading, I say
that I am not writer.  I never was, and I never intend to be.  There are
certainly enough writers in the world to write almost everything the world
could want to know about in print.  I was never skilled in the art of proper
style for any sort of writing.  Please, be kind and keep this in mind.

I wrote this guide because I felt there was a great need for something of
this nature.  I have watched so many players come to the network looking
for information on Empire, such as the rules, or information on how to play.
One can get information about the various commands available to oneself
within the game, but to understand how to use those commands effectively
and get skilled at running a country is a far greater task.  Many new
players have despaired after playing their first game for lack of the
requisite knowledge to play effectively.  Some come back fighting hard
in the next game, but many just disappear never to be heard from again.
This guide was written with the hope that if the new player is supplied
with the basics, they can advance in skill more quickly than previously
possible and not despair at their first defeat. 

I am hoping that within the near future two other companion guides to 
this one will be written and released to the net.  These two guides will
be intended to make the average player a better player or even expert,
and to teach fledgling deities how to compile and establish a, solicit 
entries for , and effectively run, a game.  Some people have commented
to me that the time spent on these guides would be better spent if I 
were to spend time programming for Empire instead.  It is my belief that
in teaching players to be better players, and teaching deities how to be 
a deity should that guide be released, the potential pool for
programmers of Empire will increase.  

I can not take credit for the idea of this guide.  The need for such
a guide I think was painfully obvious to a great many players.  Some in
fact did engage in projects to fill that need.  Every such attempt has
fallen short, in my humble opinion.  Witness the large number of people

who still ask the network, "How do I play?" and even more importantly
the lack of sufficient answer to such people's questions.  In my highest
hopes, I dream that someday soon that answer will be "Get a copy of the
User's Guide to Empire, which is available via FTP from xx.xx.xx".

This work was made possible by the contributions of several Empire players.
This work would not have been completed without the insights and assistance 
of many Empire players and deities.  To the Empire community as a whole,
I say thank you for your priceless contributions.

Chapter 1 :-: What is Empire?

	Empire is a game in which you are pitted against several other
	players in a country vs. country format.  There are economies to
	run, armies to support, policies to generate, and allies and
	enemies to make.  The game supports various features that make
	certain aspects of the game seem to parallel the "realistic"
	world.  These include satellites, planes, banks, parks, etc.
	
	Empire, in the version herein described, is a very complex 
	game.  The closest game that most people will know that is 
	analogous to it is the game known as Risk.  However, Empire is 
	more complex by a factor of at least one hundred.  Nevertheless, 
	as a result of the computer aiding you every step of the way, the 
	game is not difficult to play, though it can be difficult to 
	learn.  If you read this guide thoroughly, and use it as a 
	continuing resource, you can help make learning this game a lot 
	easier. 

	It should be noted that in learning to play this game, you
	may become frustrated or feel daunted by its complexity. 
	Several players have noted that they almost gave up on Empire,
	until one day when everything seemed to start to make sense.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><p><em>This is a guest post authored by <a href="https://jacobian.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jacob Kaplan-Moss</a>, co-creator of Django.</em></p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I’ve spent a good deal of my career with my feet in two different worlds. I came up as a web developer and helped create a popular web framework (Django). And I’ve spent a sizable chunk of my career working in information security.
Unfortunately, I’ve seen these two roles clash far too often. Engineering often sees Security as standing in the way of delivery, or as creating meaningless busywork. Security thinks Engineering is irresponsible, willing to ship broken or vulnerable code.</p>
<p>I’ve spent more than a decade trying to bridge this gap. There’s no silver bullet. But, over and over, I’ve seen one practice be quite effective: automated security tests — and particularly integrating security checks and tests into an existing CI pipeline.</p>
<h3>Bringing Security along on the CI/CD journey</h3>
<p>Engineers have largely embraced CI as a critical part of quality assurance, and that a robust test suite that runs on every commit is a huge enabler of velocity. We can be bold about making changes, knowing that the test suite will catch us if we’ve messed up. A mature CI/CD pipeline is a reliable litmus test for good software.</p>
<p>Historically, though, Security has been left out of this CI/CD journey. We’ve relied on manual security assessments; hands-on exercises like threat modelling and threat hunting; and bespoke penetration tests. These are important activities that will always have a place in a mature product security lifecycle, but they increasingly are difficult to integrate into an agile delivery model that relies on incremental changes and automated tests. Much of the friction between modern engineering and security teams can come down to this impedance mismatch.</p>
<p>So, to get Security and Engineering playing well together, one massively useful tool is getting security work integrated into continuous delivery. When done right, Security and Engineering work together to produce automated checks that cover security issues in the same test suite that’s already in CI. This maintains delivery cadence, gives confidence about the security of the product, and — most importantly — gives a place where Security and Engineering collaborate, rather than conflict, to produce secure code.</p>
<p>How does this look in practice? Each organization is different, but there’s a typical progression of maturity that Security and Engineering orgs go through as they build a continuous integration and automation pipeline:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1: Security finds problems; Engineering fixes them</li>
<li>Level 2: Security and Engineering collaborate to produce test cases and remediations</li>
<li>Level 3: After the issue is fixed, Security and Engineering collaborate to find systemic fixes and develop checks</li>
<li>Level 4: Security and Engineering now also proactively look for new classes of issues and create systemic checks before an actual problem occurs</li>
</ul>
<p>For the rest of this post, I’ll walk through each of these phases with a specific example about a team that systemically fixed an issue with logging sensitive tokens.</p>
<h3>Level 1: Security finds problems; Engineering fixes them</h3>
<p>This is (unfortunately) how many organizations operate. Nobody really works together: Security is off in one corner looking for vulnerabilities (or, worse, waiting for a breach and then responding!). When they find one, they tell Engineering, who (hopefully) fixes the problem.</p>
<p>Let’s begin the example and see how this could shake out in practice. A few months ago, Nathan Brahams <a href="https://r2c.dev/blog/2020/fixing-leaky-logs-how-to-find-a-bug-and-ensure-it-never-returns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote about systemically fixing an issue around accidentally logging sensitive tokens</a>. His article illustrates the steps a quite mature security/engineering organization would take, but I’ll use this issue as a jumping-off-point to imagine how teams earlier in their journey might approach discovering a similar issue.</p>
<p>So, imagine a budding team has found this security issue: SQLAlchemy debug logging is turned on and sensitive tokens are being logged. The issue is fixed with a clever technique that uses a custom <code>ObfuscatedString</code> column that prevents SQLAlchemy from logging the token's value. So, we just swap in <code>ObfuscatedString</code> for the token column. Problem solved, right?</p>
<p>Well, while this does fix the issue, it has many problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verification</strong>: If Engineering just rolls out this fix, how do we verify that the issue is actually fixed? Usually at this level of maturity, the Security team will manually verify the fix, but that’s error-prone. It’s also slow; if the fix didn’t work or is incomplete, the cycle has to repeat itself.</li>
<li><strong>Regression</strong>: If another engineer, some time later, doesn’t understand this <code>ObfuscatedString</code>, it could get reverted or modified in a way that re-introduces the issue. How would we know if this happens? (Spoiler alert: with an automated test, which we’ll discuss in the next section.)</li>
<li>Is this a one-off issue, or <strong>is it a systemic issue</strong>? Are there other sensitive values elsewhere that might be logged?</li>
<li><strong>Conflict</strong>: Most importantly, this workflow sets up conditions ripe for conflict between Security and Engineering. It creates a dynamic where it’s easy for Engineering to feel like Security’s just creating work for them, and where Security can feel ignored or powerless to fix problems. I’ve never seen this model produce a really healthy relationship; just ones with varying levels of dysfunction. Even when Security helps write the fix, the lack of any sort of robust verification or systemic analysis means it’s very likely they’ll need to come back later with this issue or a similar one again, which both parties will resent.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Level 2: automated tests</h3>
<p>The next rung on the maturity ladder is one that’s becoming increasingly common: instead of just fixing a security issue, Security and Engineering will collaborate on producing a test case (and often the fix). Following along with the example above, we might write a test case that sets up a test model with an <code>ObfuscatedString</code> column, captures some logs, and verifies that the value is correctly obfuscated.</p>
<p>This relatively simple addition fixes a bunch of problems we had before:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verification</strong>: If the test case passes, we can be confident the security issue is fixed.</li>
<li><strong>Regression</strong>: Because this test case is part of our test suite, if it ever regresses the test case will fail, and we won’t risk re-introducing it to production.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: Security and Engineering are now working more closely together, increasing the chances both teams will see this as “our issue” and “our fix”, not “their problem”.</li>
</ul>
<p>But: we still lack any sort of understanding of whether this issue occurs elsewhere, or any sort of holistic fix for the entire class of issues. In the case of logging sensitive tokens, it’s easy to imagine this issue occurring elsewhere. So when — inevitably — a similar issue occurs elsewhere, we’re likely to be bitten again. And this, in turn, will continue to produce the kind of resentment that can be so damaging to Security/Engineering working well together.</p>
<h3>Level 3: systemic fixes and checks</h3>
<p>The next step, then, is for Security and Engineering to work together to find systemic problems and fixes. Things start out as above — it’s important to fix the specific vulnerability first, before getting fancy! But after the specific fix is in, Security and Engineering come together to figure out if this is a systemic problem. If so, they work to develop a check or a fix.</p>
<p>Sometimes this can be a fairly simple holistic fix. For example, <a href="https://r2c.dev/blog/2020/understanding-and-preventing-dos-in-web-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I wrote about ReDoS last time</a>. Discovery of a ReDoS vulnerability might lead to discovering other similar potential problems. That in turn could lead to the decision to switch to <a href="https://github.com/google/re2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">re2</a>, which isn’t vulnerable to ReDoS.</p>
<p>But much of the time, the systemic fix is more complex — there isn’t a simple drop-in replacement that eliminates a class of vulnerabilities. That’s true of this sensitive-logging issue: we don’t have any sort of logging module that can magically know when variables are sensitive, and obfuscate them.</p>
<p>This is where code scanning tools like Semgrep come in. They are a terrifically important part of a mature product security workflow. Traditional testing practices — unit tests, integration tests, etc — are great for reproducing specific security issues, and ensuring that they’re fixed and won’t regress. But they struggle to discover whole classes of security issues, and this is what code scanners enable. Traditional code linters (e.g., Flake8, RuboCop) help to ensure code consistency and find some common issues, but since they have to apply generally to all kinds of projects, they tend to only provide a one-size-fits-all best-practices check. Tools that understand code semantically, like Semgrep, can be used to write tests for <em>your unique codebase</em> and find whole classes of security issues — including, most importantly, new instances of a problem that might be added after the check has been written.</p>
<p>And indeed, that’s what Nathan and his team did: they wrote a Semgrep rule that finds columns with names suggesting they’re sensitive (e.g., containing “token”, “secret”, “key”, etc), and issues a warning.</p>
<p>At this point, we’re in a pretty good spot. New code is continually scanned for this issue, and when found, they are fixed robustly. We have a workflow and tooling that ensures that the original, specific issue is fixed and that it stays fixed, and we ensure that similar issues — present and future — are discovered and fixed. Security and Engineering collaborate on this work, which is now well-automated. There’s still (of course) room for teams to not get along, but we’ve removed some of the most common pain points (verification, regression, conflict between teams).</p>
<p>If suddenly blocking builds with new checks will only increase conflict in your organization, you could softly roll out checks that do not block Engineering and only notify Security. For issues that arise, Security can begin conversations with Engineering to collaborate on both specific and systemic fixes. Once the check is satisfactory to both …</p></div></div></div></section></div>

We have since rewritten these multiple instances into a 16 voice Poly-Goldfish with 4 oscillators per voice. To celebrate we designed a PCB and brightly coloured frontpanel to give this new Goldfish some dedicated controls.</p>
<p>Bring-up was trivial due to the amazing documentation and the extremely flexible PIO-blocks. The RP2040 is a dream to work with. Childlike giddiness ensued while lying on the carpet and programming in VSCode on an RPi400 talking directly to the RP2040. This is the way to release a chip onto the world: with fantastic documentation, an open toolchain and plenty of examples of how to use everything. There is a tantalizing hint at the start of the data sheet that this is the lowest grade chip of the family they plan to release… we cannot wait to play with the RP4755.</p>

<p>Once these chips hit general availability we will probably share some designs on our <a href="https://github.com/ThisIsNotRocketScience">Github</a>. This chip is now part of our go-to set of tools to make the cool stuff and will very bloody likely be inside our next three modules.</p>

Because of the easy, &nbsp;high quality, multi-platform, FREE and even beginner-friendly toolchain they have built around this chip we can expand the accessibility to the insides of our designs. With these chips it is way easier for us to have you do things like adding your own algorithms, building extra modes or creating personal effects. We can lean on the quality of RaspberryPi platform and this amazing chip.</p>

<p>Without leaving the letter <em>M</em>: <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#moore-s-law"><strong>Moore’s Law</strong></a>, <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#murphy-s-law"><strong>Murphy’s Law</strong></a>, <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#metcalfe-s-law"><strong>Metcalfe’s Law</strong></a>, <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#mooers-law"><strong>Mooers’s Law</strong></a>. I’m not saying an adage should never, ever be named after a person. I’ll admit, <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#moore-s-law"><strong>Moore’s Law</strong></a> and <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#murphy-s-law"><strong>Murphy’s Law</strong></a> have a certain catchiness to them. But the trend of taking a maxim and calling it Person’s Law has resulted in dozens and dozens of these things being produced, and it makes my head spin. Soon every fact or aphorism will be Somebody’s Law. Not only have such adage laws become a cliché, but, as I have found when researching this article, many of the laws are either not named after the person who came up with the idea (ignorance), or are named by the author after themselves (egotism). They are also called “laws” when they aren’t really laws to lend the ideas more credence than they deserve, or at least more memetic value. It’s hard for me not to take on a negative tone in this article after being exposed to such egotism and ignorance. Apologies in advance.</p>
<p>Newton earned his laws. So did Asimov. But now any lazy aphorism can lend your name immortality if you push for it hard enough. Let me give it a go:</p>

Taylor’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>If an adage is named after a person and called a law, there is a 50% chance the law is named after the wrong person, and if not, there is a 50% chance it was named by the author after themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tell your friends. Ironically, I have basically stolen <strong>Stigler’s Law</strong> here (see <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#stigler-s-law">below</a>). Oh well, nothing is new under the sun.</p>
<p>Here are some popular adage laws. There are so many of them, but I bet you’ve heard of at least half. Special thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_eponymous_laws">Wikipedia’s list of eponymous laws</a>.:</p>
<h3 id="amara-s-law"><a href="#amara-s-law" aria-label="Anchor link for: amara-s-law"><img src="https://taylor.gl/static/link.c4135b47e4.svg" alt="chain link icon"></a>
Amara’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>People overestimate the impact of a given technology initially, then underestimate it. Basically, when the hype bubble bursts, people are disappointed. After that, things return to a reasonable baseline. <em>Named after Roy Amara, the futurist who created the idea.</em></p>

Andy and Bill’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>An increase in hardware computing power will be met with an increase in software demand. Very similar to <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#wirth-s-law">Wirth’s law</a>. <em>Named after Andy Grove, Intel’s former CEO, and Bill Gates, Microsoft’s former CEO. Based on an old joke that, “what Andy gives, Bill takes away.”</em></p>

Atwood’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>All software that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript. <em>Created by Jeff Atwood, of the <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/">Coding Horror</a> blog. Named by himself after himself.</em></p>

Benford’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In real-world data sets, the leading digit is much more likely to be a ’1’ than any other digit: the chance is about 30% <em>Named after Frank Benford, who originally called it the Law of Anomalous Numbers, though it was mentioned first by Simon Newcomb decades prior.</em>. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="benford-s-law-of-controversy"><a href="#benford-s-law-of-controversy" aria-label="Anchor link for: benford-s-law-of-controversy"><img src="https://taylor.gl/static/link.c4135b47e4.svg" alt="chain link icon"></a>
Benford’s Law of Controversy:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Passion is inversely proportional to the amount of real information available.” <em>Stated by Gregory Benford the sci-fi author, not to be confused with Frank Benford, the physicist and engineer who lends their name to the first Benford’s Law.</em> Because we have two “Benford’s laws”, maybe we should stick to Frank Benford’s original name for his law: the Law of Anomalous Numbers.</p>

<h3 id="betteridge-s-law"><a href="#betteridge-s-law" aria-label="Anchor link for: betteridge-s-law"><img src="https://taylor.gl/static/link.c4135b47e4.svg" alt="chain link icon"></a>
Betteridge’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Headlines which end in a question mark can be answered by the word “no”. (This really only makes sense for yes-or-no question headlines.) Studies have tried to disprove this law by showing that articles which have yes-or-no headlines are more likely to be answered in the body of the article “yes” than “no”, but these studies are clearly missing the point of the law. <em>Named after the tech journalist Ian Betteridge, who did not create the principle, though he claimed he did. Also referred to earlier as “Davis’ law”, with no reference to who Davis is.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="brandolini-s-law"><a href="#brandolini-s-law" aria-label="Anchor link for: brandolini-s-law"><img src="https://taylor.gl/static/link.c4135b47e4.svg" alt="chain link icon"></a>
Brandolini’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude larger than the energy needed to produce it. <em>Originally called the Bullshit Asymmetry Principle by Alberto Brandolini on Twitter, though the idea has been around since before Twitter was even a thing.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="brooks-law"><a href="#brooks-law" aria-label="Anchor link for: brooks-law"><img src="https://taylor.gl/static/link.c4135b47e4.svg" alt="chain link icon"></a>
Brooks’ Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later” because it takes time for new members of a team to become productive, and because tasks are not infinitely divisible and adding people creates communication and collaboration overhead. <em>Created by Fred Brooks, author of the Mythical Man-Month, and named after himself.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="campbell-s-law"><a href="#campbell-s-law" aria-label="Anchor link for: campbell-s-law"><img src="https://taylor.gl/static/link.c4135b47e4.svg" alt="chain link icon"></a>
Campbell’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Quantitative social metrics often corrupt the process they are intended to measure because people will try to game the metric. <em>Created by the social scientist Donald T. Campbell. Although this law is often worded differently than <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#goodhart-s-law">Goodhart’s law</a>, as described by Campbell it is basically indistinguishable from Goodhart’s law, which was stated before Campbell’s law.</em></p>

<h3 id="cheop-s-law"><a href="#cheop-s-law" aria-label="Anchor link for: cheop-s-law"><img src="https://taylor.gl/static/link.c4135b47e4.svg" alt="chain link icon"></a>
Cheop’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing is ever built on schedule or within budget. A patently false child of <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#hofstadter-s-law">Hofstadter’s law</a> and <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#murphy-s-law">Murphy’s law</a>. <em>This one is named after an ancient Egyptian pharaoh, but was created by Robert A. Heinlein in one of his novels.</em></p>

<h3 id="chesterton-s-fence"><a href="#chesterton-s-fence" aria-label="Anchor link for: chesterton-s-fence"><img src="https://taylor.gl/static/link.c4135b47e4.svg" alt="chain link icon"></a>
Chesterton’s Fence:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don’t know why something is a certain way, leave it alone until you do. If you see a fence or other barrier across a road, some people will immediately try to remove it, but they may be ignorant of the reason for the fence and so could be making a mistake. <em>Named after Gilbert Keith Chesterton who stated it in one of his books. The allegory is clever and original, but the underlying idea is not and is essentially a restating of, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” or of the Precautionary principle, etc. It’s not technically an adage law, but I included it because I like it.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="claasen-s-law"><a href="#claasen-s-law" aria-label="Anchor link for: claasen-s-law"><img src="https://taylor.gl/static/link.c4135b47e4.svg" alt="chain link icon"></a>
Claasen’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Usefulness increases with the logarithm of technology. Combined with <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#moore-s-law">Moore’s law</a>, this gives technology a linear rate of improvement in terms of usefulness. <em>Named after the originator of the idea, Theo A. C. M. Claasen, the former CTO of Philips Semiconductors.</em> </p>

Clarke’s Three Laws:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Ooh, three laws by one person</p>
<ol>
<li>When a famous, elderly scientist claims something is possible, they are almost certainly right. But when they claim something is impossible, they are almost certainly wrong.</li>
<li>The only way to know the limit of what’s possible is to cross that limit and find out what’s impossible.</li>
<li>“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>By the sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke. The third one is the most famous, though also the least original, as very similar things have been said before by other authors, including Isaac Asimov: “An uninformed public tends to confuse scholarship with magicianry.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="conway-s-law"><a href="#conway-s-law" aria-label="Anchor link for: conway-s-law"><img src="https://taylor.gl/static/link.c4135b47e4.svg" alt="chain link icon"></a>
Conway’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Any system has a structure which reflects the communication structure of the organization which produced it.

    <section>
            <div>
        
<p>In early April, <a href="https://first10em.com/aerosols-droplets-and-airborne-spread/">I wrote a long post covering all the science I could find about aerosols and droplets</a>. The basic summary was that this is an area of medicine with lots of misconceptions, poor assumptions, and incomplete science. There was good evidence that previous coronaviruses were spread by aerosols. There was good evidence that influenza is spread by aerosols. Overall, it seemed very likely that SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 was being spread by aerosols, but the science was pretty weak. There is still a lot we don’t know, but as I update the evidence 6 months later, it is pretty clear that aerosols play an important, and unfortunately still widely ignored, role in the transmission of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Dispelling some misconceptions</strong></h2>



<p>There are still many who argue strongly against the role of aerosols in transmission of COVID-19. In general, I think these arguments clash with science and have significant logical inconsistencies. Before getting to the evidence that COVID-19 is spread by aerosols, let’s dispel a few widely held misconceptions.</p>



<h3>COVID-19 has a low Ro</h3>



<p>One main argument against aerosol spread points to the Ro, with the assumption that airborne diseases will always spread easily, and therefore have a high Ro. The argument is often framed as, “this disease doesn’t look like measles, and therefore cannot possibly be airborne.” This is bad logic, as infectivity and mechanism of transmission are separate concepts. Some pathogens require higher numbers to reliably cause infections, which will result in a lower Ro no matter how the infection is transmitted. “While many airborne infections are highly contagious, this is not, strictly speaking, part of the definition.” (Tellier 2019)</p>



<p>The logic here is clearly faulty. The argument being used has the basic format: “X is a Y. Z is not like X. Therefore Z cannot be a Y.” This is somewhat like saying “a horse is a mammal, therefore that dog cannot be a mammal because they don’t look the same.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This logic is especially problematic in the context of aerosol spread because there are other diseases with good evidence of aerosol spread, such as influenza, that look nothing like measles, but a lot like COVID-19. In fact, the prototypical airborne pathogen is tuberculosis, and tuberculosis has an Ro between 1-3 (exactly like COVID-19). (Ma 2018)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, the statement that ‘COVID looks nothing like measles’ is probably untrue. On average, disease transmission is low, but if you look at <a href="#superspreaders">super-spreaders</a>, COVID-19 starts to look a lot like measles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, the arguments based on Ro are both illogical and inconsistent with science. If anything, the Ro of COVID-19 looks exactly like other known airborne diseases (such as tuberculosis), and so this would be an argument in favour of airborne spread.</p>



<h3>Most transmission is short distance</h3>



<p>The equally fallacious corollary to the Ro argument is that “if COVID-19 is transmitted through aerosols, we should see a lot of infections occurring over long distances”. Although it is true that aerosols will disperse much further than droplets, it is faulty logic to define the <em>mode</em> of transmission by the <em>distance</em> of transmission. The concentration of infectious particles falls dramatically with distance, even when those infectious particles are carried by aerosols. They are spread out through 3 dimensional space, and therefore decrease exponentially with distance. Although aerosols <em>can </em>transmit disease over long distances, they are much more likely to transmit disease over a short distance. (Chen 2020)</p>



<p>This illogical step is so ingrained in the infectious diseases literature that most studies just assume droplet spread if there was close contact. This illogical assumption undermines a great deal of the existing infectious disease literature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an interesting historical analogy, for decades it was thought that tuberculosis was transmitted through droplets and fomites, because it occurred most often after close contact. We now know that tuberculosis <em>can only be transmitted through aerosols. </em>(Jimenez 2020)</p>



<p>The existing science refutes the assumption that close contact suggests droplet spread. At the typical conversational distance of about 1 meter, exposure to aerosols is about 2000 times greater than exposure to droplets. (Chen 2020)</p>



<p>The bottom line is that short range disease transmission is definitely consistent with aerosol transmission, and distance cannot be used to define mode of transmission. </p>

Transmission by both aerosols and droplets is highest when close to the patient. Although aerosol transmission can occur at a distance, the vast majority will occur at close range.</figcaption></figure>



<p>So why don’t we see a lot of long range transmission of COVID-19? The primary explanation is simple dilution. The further you are from a patient, the more dilute aerosols become. Risk of aerosol transmission drops off dramatically with increasing distance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The importance of dilution of aerosols is evident in everyday life. You can smell cigarette smoke when you are standing 8 meters away from a smoker, but it is nothing like the obnoxious fumes present if you were standing right next to them. Similarly, cigarette smoke is much worse indoors than out. Imagine each smoke molecule as a virus. You are obviously at much higher risk 1 meter away than you are at 8 meters. (But that doesn’t make smoke a droplet.)</p>



<p>Dilution doesn’t prevent exposure to the virus, but it makes it less probable. With dilution of aerosols, the primary driver of infection is the intrinsic infectivity of the pathogen. If infection occurs after exposure to only a few viral particles, we should expect to see more long range transmission despite the dilution. If larger exposures are required, we will see fewer infections. This is the primary difference between measles and COVID-19.</p>



<p>One final note about long range transmission: we really don’t know how common it is in COVID-19. Identification of long range transmission is incredibly difficult unless there are a very small number of cases. With a small outbreak of measles cases, it is easier to determine exactly where individuals were, and identify airborne transmission. For the vast majority of COVID-19 cases, we do not know how the individual became ill, and so could easily be overlooking long range transmission (especially when the possibility of aerosol transmission is dismissed out of hand in some circles). In fact, there seems to be pretty good evidence of long range transmission in many of the <a href="#superspreader">super-spreader events discussed below</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Our current approach is working</h3>



<p>Another argument occasionally used to dismiss aerosols as a mode of transmission is that our current PPE approach seems to be working in hospitals. First, <a href="https://first10em.com/we-are-not-doing-enough-to-protect-healthcare-workers-from-covid-19/">I would point out that healthcare workers are contracting COVID-19 at a rate that is far higher than the general population</a>, so this argument is pretty weak. Furthermore, as will be explored further below, there are many other factors that significantly dilute aerosols in most hospitals, like excellent ventilation, good distancing, and masking of both patients and providers. Although not quite as good as N95s, well fitting surgical masks will still filter out as much as 80% of infectious aerosols. (Makison Booth 2013) Combined with the low infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, these factors keep us relatively safe even when we stubbornly ignore the science that suggests aerosols are very important in the transmission of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Particle size</h3>



<p>Many of the arguments against the aerosol spread of COVID-19 rely on incorrect assumptions about particle size. <a href="https://first10em.com/aerosols-droplets-and-airborne-spread/">I went into this at length in the first post</a>, so won’t repeat myself here. The basic summary is that particles of sizes that many articles refer to as droplets actually remain airborne for prolonged periods, and are therefore better classified as aerosols for the purposes of transmission. Just be careful when reading articles, because many don’t define these terms. When I use the term aerosol here, I am referring to any droplet that remains suspended in the air for longer that a few seconds, whatever the size, because that is the feature that matters for infection control. </p>



<h3>The lack of definitive proof</h3>



<p>Some of the arguments against aerosol transmission simply assume droplet transmission and demand “definitive proof” for aerosol transmission. I won’t attempt a treatise on the philosophy of science here, but that is an unreasonable bar.</p>



<p>One version of this argument states that viable SARS-CoV-2 has never been isolated from the air, and therefore we cannot definitively prove airborne transmission. This demand is unreasonable. Measles and tuberculosis are both known to be airborne, and no one has been able to isolate viable pathogens for either from the air. (Jimenez 2020) Furthermore, this is probably an outdated argument, as multiple studies actually have identified viable SARS-CoV-2 in the air. (Lednicky 2020; Santarpia 2020a)&nbsp;</p>



<p>The specifics of whether or not viable virus has been cultured from air samples is irrelevant. The point is that unfair standards are being used when comparing aerosols and droplets. There is no definitive proof that SARS-CoV-2 spreads through large droplets. (Jimenez 2020) It is crazy to require such stringent proof of aerosol transmission, while simultaneously just assuming droplet transmission is occurring. The same standards must be required for both claims. We are unlikely to have ‘definitive proof’ of either claim. Our decisions must be made based on the preponderance of the evidence.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>There is good evidence that COVID-19 spreads through aerosols</strong></h2>



<p>Although there is no “smoking gun”, the evidence that COVID-19 spreads through aerosols is relatively strong. Below I outline the …</p></div></section></div></article></div>

<p>Jeff Bezos — a strong Democratic supporter — and Amazon are aiming to postpone a unionization vote at one of its warehouses in Alabama, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-seeks-to-postpone-alabama-unionization-vote-11611339250?mod=e2tw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>. Interestingly, Amazon has requested that the National Labor Relations Board reconsider allowing mail-in voting, claiming that the mail-in voting process has “serious and systemic flaws.”</p>
<p>Got that? Bezos and Amazon are doing all they can to prevent any shady activity when workers cast their ballots for unionization, and they are particularly concerned about the integrity of mail-in ballots.</p>
<p>You are likely trying to figure out how that adds up, right? The <em>Washington Post</em>, owned by Bezos, called any claims of mail-in voter fraud by Donald Trump and his supporters dangerous and inexcusable. Amazon even banned Parler from its servers, in part to ensure no one could claim voter fraud occurred from mail-in ballots back in November.</p>
<p>But stop trying to make it make sense. It is not supposed to add up.</p>
<p>In this case, mail-in voting is disadvantageous for Bezos and his e-commerce behemoth. Therefore, they now consider mail-in voting seriously flawed.</p>
<p>An Amazon spokesperson <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/22/tech/amazon-nlrb-union-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tells</a> CNN the company is seeking a “valid, fair and successful election” and suggests that only in-person voting can ensure that. Hmm, interesting perspective.</p>
<p>Amazon has, thus far, fended off unions in the United States. If a majority of ballots vote in favor of unionization, hourly Amazon workers would send an L right up to Bezos’ office.</p>
<p>Bamazonunion.com explains that a union at Amazon would “give us the right to collectively bargain over our working conditions including items such as safety standards, training, breaks, pay, benefits, and other important issues that would make our workplace better.”</p>
<p>The NLRB says, “A mail ballot election will enfranchise employees who cannot enter the voting location for health reasons or due to positive COVID tests.” Fearing an unfavorable outcome, however, Amazon now insists that current COVID outbreaks aren’t dangerous enough to warrant this NLRB decision.</p>
<p>Amazon says that Lisa Henderson, NLRB’s Acting Regional Director “reached the remarkable conclusion that any level of infection or potential infection among employees counts as an ‘outbreak.'” <em>O</em><em>nly</em> 218 people employees, 2.88%, at its Bessemer facility tested positive during the 14-day period ending on January 7, which Amazon does not consider an “outbreak” apparently. This is quite the change of perspective. Imagine the coverage from the <em>Washington Post</em> if similar questions had been asked before November.</p>
<p>Mail-in voting has never been about the health of Americans or ensuring that each voice counts. As always, our country’s most powerful figures in both Washington and Silicon Valley base their opinions solely on the outcomes that increase their own power, finances, and flexibility.</p>
<p>Hypocritical, but sadly, all too predictable.</p>

										<p>Part of learning a language to mastery is being able to generate fresh thoughts and ideas on your own.  With our visual sentence composer you'll be able to create fresh statements and share them with your friends.</p>
										<p>Other users on the platform will be able to see your posts and give you encouragement with a "like" or a "re-wag" (similar to a "retweet" in Twitterland.) </p>
										<p>People will be able to see your unique statements made from real Japanese, and we plan to offer inline translations of the posts so others can follow along in English and so that you can be sure your statement means what you want it to mean.</p>

										<h2>Master Japanese with Ease</h2>
										<p>
											Japanese, just like any other skill, takes practice to master.  Start your immersion experience in a fun and social way -- by creating real Japanese and sharing it with others, so you can encourage one another on your path to mastery!</p>
										<p>There are many ways to get exposed to Japanese via media, music, shows, and immersion, but relatively few ways to practice language generation in a way that makes sure you won't habituate to making the same mistakes over and over again.  We are changing this with our Visual Sentence Composer.  <a href="#signup">Sign up today to be notified when it's available for free!</a></p>

January 23, 2021 | https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/#id1 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/#id1">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<li><p><strong>PROCESS</strong> Version numbers are now simply <code><span>X.Y</span></code> where the leading <code><span>1</span></code>
has been dropped.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE</strong> Dropped support for Python 3.1.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE</strong> Removed the bundle support which was deprecated in
1.4. (#1806)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE</strong> File lists generated by <cite>pip show -f</cite> are now
rooted at the location reported by show, rather than one (unstated)
directory lower. (#1933)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE</strong> The ability to install files over the FTP protocol
was accidentally lost in pip 1.5 and it has now been decided to not restore
that ability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE</strong> PEP 440 is now fully implemented, this means that
in some cases versions will sort differently or version specifiers will be
interpreted differently than previously. The common cases should all function
similarly to before.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>DEPRECATION</strong> <code><span>pip</span> <span>install</span> <span>--download-cache</span></code> and
<code><span>pip</span> <span>wheel</span> <span>--download-cache</span></code> command line flags have been deprecated and
the functionality removed. Since pip now automatically configures and uses
it’s internal HTTP cache which supplants the <code><span>--download-cache</span></code> the
existing options have been made non functional but will still be accepted
until their removal in pip v8.0. For more information please see
<a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install.html#caching">https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install.html#caching</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>DEPRECATION</strong> <code><span>pip</span> <span>install</span> <span>--build</span></code> and <code><span>pip</span> <span>install</span> <span>--no-clean</span></code> are now
<em>NOT</em> deprecated.  This reverses the deprecation that occurred in v1.5.3.
(#906)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>DEPRECATION</strong> Implicitly accessing URLs which point to an origin which is
not a secure origin, instead requiring an opt-in for each host using the new
<code><span>--trusted-host</span></code> flag (<code><span>pip</span> <span>install</span> <span>--trusted-host</span> <span>example.com</span> <span>foo</span></code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Allow the new <code><span>--trusted-host</span></code> flag to also disable TLS verification for
a particular hostname.</p></li>
<li><p>Added a <code><span>--user</span></code> flag to <code><span>pip</span> <span>freeze</span></code> and <code><span>pip</span> <span>list</span></code> to check the
user site directory only.</p></li>
<li><p>Silence byte compile errors when installation succeed. (#1873)</p></li>
<li><p>Added a virtualenv-specific configuration file. (#1364)</p></li>
<li><p>Added site-wide configuration files. (1978)</p></li>
<li><p>Added an automatic check to warn if there is an updated version of pip
available. (#2049)</p></li>
<li><p><cite>wsgiref</cite> and <cite>argparse</cite> (for &gt;py26) are now excluded from <cite>pip list</cite> and
<cite>pip freeze</cite>. (#1606, #1369)</p></li>
<li><p>Add <code><span>--client-cert</span></code> option for SSL client certificates. (#1424)</p></li>
<li><p><cite>pip show --files</cite> was broken for wheel installs. (#1635, #1484)</p></li>
<li><p>install_lib should take precedence when reading distutils config.
(#1642, #1641)</p></li>
<li><p>Send <cite>Accept-Encoding: identity</cite> when downloading files in an attempt to
convince some servers who double compress the downloaded file to stop doing
so. (#1688)</p></li>
<li><p>Stop breaking when given pip commands in uppercase (#1559, #1725)</p></li>
<li><p>pip no longer adds duplicate logging consumers, so it won’t create duplicate
output when being called multiple times. (#1618, #1723)</p></li>
<li><p><cite>pip wheel</cite> now returns an error code if any wheels fail to build. (#1769)</p></li>
<li><p><cite>pip wheel</cite> wasn’t building wheels for dependencies of editable requirements.
(#1775)</p></li>
<li><p>Allow the use of <code><span>--no-use-wheel</span></code> within a requirements file. (#1859)</p></li>
<li><p>Attempt to locate system TLS certificates to use instead of the included
CA Bundle if possible. (#1680, #1866)</p></li>
<li><p>Allow use of Zip64 extension in Wheels and other zip files. (#1319, #1868)</p></li>
<li><p>Properly handle an index or --find-links target which has a &lt;base&gt; without a
href attribute. (#1101, #1869)</p></li>
<li><p>Properly handle extras when a project is installed via Wheel. (#1885, #1896)</p></li>
<li><p>Added support to respect proxies in <code><span>pip</span> <span>search</span></code>.
(#1180, #932, #1104, #1902)</p></li>
<li><p><cite>pip install --download</cite> works with vcs links. (#798, #1060, #1926)</p></li>
<li><p>Disabled warning about insecure index host when using localhost. Based off of
Guy Rozendorn’s work in #1718. (#1456, #1967)</p></li>
<li><p>Allow the use of OS standard user configuration files instead of ones simply
based around <code><span>$HOME</span></code>. (#2021)</p></li>
<li><p>When installing directly from wheel paths or urls, previous versions were not
uninstalled. (#1825, #804, #1838)</p></li>
<li><p>Detect the location of the <code><span>.egg-info</span></code> directory by looking for any file
located inside of it instead of relying on the record file listing a
directory. (#2075, #2076)</p></li>
<li><p>Use a randomized and secure default build directory when possible.
(#1964, #1935, #676, #2122, CVE-2014-8991)</p></li>
<li><p>Support environment markers in requirements.txt files. (#1433, #2134)</p></li>
<li><p>Automatically retry failed HTTP requests by default. (#1444, #2147)</p></li>
<li><p>Handle HTML Encoding better using a method that is more similar to how
browsers handle it. (#1100, #1874)</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce the verbosity of the pip command by default. (#2175, #2177, #2178)</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/2031">#2031</a> - Respect sys.executable on OSX when installing from
Wheels.</p></li>
<li><p>Display the entire URL of the file that is being downloaded when downloading
from a non PyPI repository. (#2183)</p></li>
<li><p>Support setuptools style environment markers in a source distribution. (#2153)</p></li>

A shitty implementation of a good abstraction causes no net harm to the code base. A bad abstraction or missing layer causes everything to rot. &nbsp;</li><li>Java isn't that terrible of a language.</li><li>Clever code isn't usually good code.
