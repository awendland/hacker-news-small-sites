      <p>This blog post explains the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217">Hopfield Networks is All You Need</a> and the corresponding new PyTorch <a href="https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers">Hopfield layer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="main-contributions">Main contributions</h2>
<p>We introduce a new energy function and a corresponding new update rule which is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum of the energy function.</p>

<p>The new energy function is a generalization (discrete states \(\Rightarrow\) continuous states) of <strong>modern Hopfield Networks</strong> aka <strong>Dense Associative Memories</strong> introduced by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01164">Krotov and Hopfield</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01929">Demircigil et al.</a>
The new modern Hopfield Network with continuous states keeps the characteristics of its discrete counterparts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>exponential storage capacity</li>
  <li>extremely fast convergence</li>
</ul>

<p>Surprisingly, the new update rule is the attention mechanism of transformer networks introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Attention Is All You Need</a>.
We use these new insights to analyze transformer models in the paper.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-blog-post-is-about">What this blog post is about</h2>

<p>This blog post is split into three parts. First, we make the transition from traditional Hopfield Networks towards <strong>modern Hopfield Networks</strong> and their generalization to continuous states through our <strong>new energy function</strong>. Second, the properties of our new energy function and the connection to the self-attention mechanism of transformer networks is shown. Finally, we introduce and explain a new PyTorch layer (<a href="https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers">Hopfield layer</a>), which is built on the insights of our work. We show several practical use cases, i.e. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13505">Modern Hopfield Networks and Attention for Immune Repertoire Classification</a>, Hopfield pooling, and associations of two sets.</p>

<h2 id="from-classical-hopfield-networks-to-self-attention">From classical Hopfield Networks to self-attention</h2>

<p><strong>Associative memories</strong> are one of the earliest artificial neural models dating back to the 1960s and 1970s. Best known are <a href="https://authors.library.caltech.edu/7427/1/HOPpnas82.pdf">Hopfield Networks</a>, presented by John Hopfield in 1982.
As the name suggests, the main purpose of associative memory networks is to associate an input with its most similar pattern. In other words, the purpose is to store and retrieve patterns.
We start with a review of classical Hopfield Networks.</p>

<h3 id="hopfield-networks">Hopfield Networks</h3>

<p>The simplest associative memory is just a <strong>sum of outer products</strong> of the \(N\) patterns \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) that we want to store (Hebbian learning rule). In classical Hopfield Networks these patterns are polar (binary), i.e. \(\boldsymbol{x}_i \in \{ -1,1 \}^d\), where \(d\) is the length of the patterns. The corresponding weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \sum_i^N \boldsymbol{x}_i \boldsymbol{x}_i^T \ . \tag{1}
\end{equation}\]

<p>The weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) stores the patterns, which can be retrieved starting with a <strong>state pattern</strong> \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\).</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Nomenclature</strong></p>

<p>From now on we denote the \(N\) <strong>stored patterns</strong> as \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) and any <strong>state pattern</strong> or <strong>state</strong> as \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\).</p>

<hr>

<p>The basic <strong>synchronuous update rule</strong> is to repeatedly multiply the state pattern \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) with the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\), subtract the bias and take the sign:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\xi^{t+1}} =  \text{sgn}(\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{\xi}^t - \boldsymbol{b}) \ , \tag{2}
\label{eq:restorage}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where \(\boldsymbol{b} \in \mathbb{R}^d\) is a bias vector, which can be interpreted as threshold for every component.
The <strong>asynchronous update rule</strong> performs this update only for one component of \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) and then selects the next component for update.
Convergence is reached if \(\boldsymbol{\xi^{t+1}} = \boldsymbol{\xi^{t}}\).</p>

<p>The asynchronous version of the update rule of Eq. \eqref{eq:restorage} minimizes the <strong>energy function</strong> \(\text{E}\):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\text{E} = -\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{\xi}^T \boldsymbol{W} \boldsymbol{\xi} + \boldsymbol{\xi}^T\boldsymbol{b} = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^d\sum_{j=1}^d w_{ij}\xi_i\xi_j + \sum_{i=1}^d b_i\xi_i \ . \tag{3}
\label{eq:energy_hopfield}
\end{equation}\]

<p>As derived in the papers of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=58341">Bruck</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166218X85900290">Goles-Chacc et al.</a> and <a href="https://authors.library.caltech.edu/7427/1/HOPpnas82.pdf">the original Hopfield paper</a>, the convergence properties are dependent on the structure of the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) and the method by which the nodes are updated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For asynchronous updates with \(w_{ii} \geq 0\) and \(w_{ij} = w_{ji}\), the updates converge to a stable state.</li>
  <li>For synchronous updates with \(w_{ij} = w_{ji}\), the updates converge to a stable state or a limit cycle of length 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the asynchronous update rule and symmetric weights, \(\text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t+1}) \leq \text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t})\) holds. When \(\text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t+1}) = \text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t})\) for the update of every component of \(\boldsymbol{\xi}^t\), a local minimum in \(\text{E}\) is reached.
All stored patterns \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) should be fixed points of the Hopfield Network, i.e.</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{x}_i = \text{sgn}(\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{x}_i - \boldsymbol{b}) \ . \tag{4}
\end{equation}\]

<p>They should even be local minima of \(\text{E}\).</p>

<p>In the following example, no bias vector is used. This means that taking the inverse image, i.e. flipping all pixels at once, results in the same energy.</p>

<p>We start with an <strong>illustrative example</strong> of a Hopfield Network. <strong>One input image</strong> should first be stored and then be retrieved.
The input image is:</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_original.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>Since an associative memory has <strong>polar states and patterns</strong> (or binary states and patterns), we convert the input image to a black and white image:</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>The <strong>weight matrix</strong> \(\boldsymbol{W}\) is the outer product of this black and white image \(\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}} \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^T \ , \qquad \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}} \in \{ -1,1\}^d \ , \tag{5}
\label{eq:weight_matrix}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where for this example \(d = 64 \times 64\).</p>

<p>Can the original image be restored if half of the pixels are masked out? The masked image is:</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw_masked.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>which is our inital state \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\). This inital state is updated via multiplication with the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\).
It takes one update until the original image is restored.</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw_masked_retrieved.png" alt="not found" width="600px"></p>

<p>What happens if we store <strong>more than one pattern</strong>? The weight matrix is then built from the sum of outer products of <strong>three stored patterns</strong> (three input images):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \sum_{i=1}^3 \boldsymbol{x}_i \boldsymbol{x}_i^T \ , \qquad \boldsymbol{x}_i \in \{ -1,1\}^d \ . \tag{6}
\end{equation}\]

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/multi_pat_img/experiment_6.png" alt="not found"></p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/multi_pat_img/experiment_12.png" alt="not found"></p>

<p>In this figure, the left hand side shows the three stored patterns, and the right hand side shows masked state patterns \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) together with the retrieved patterns \(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{\text{new}}\).</p>

<p>Looking at the upper row of images might suggest that the retrieval process is no longer perfect. But there are two interesting facts to take into account:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Masking the original images introduces many pixel values of \(-1\). We therefore have the odd behavior that the inner product \(\langle\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^{\text{masked}},\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Bart}}\rangle\) is larger than the inner product \(\langle\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^{\text{masked}},\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\rangle\).</li>
  <li>As stated above, if no bias vector is used, the inverse of the pattern, i.e. flipping all pixels at once, results in the same energy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the retrieval of the upper image looks incorrect, it is de facto correct. However, for the lower row example, the retrieval is no longer correct.
The weights of \(2 \cdot \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Marge}}\) have simply overwritten the weights of \(\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\).
For both examples, only the retrieval after the first update step is shown, but the results do not change when performing further update steps.
The next figure shows the Hopfield Network retrieval for 6 patterns.</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/multi_pat_img/experiment_115.png" alt="not found"></p>

<p>Clearly, retrieving the patterns is imperfect. One might suspect that the limited storage capacities of Hopfield Networks, see <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.322.3548&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Amit et al.</a> and <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevE.66.061910">Torres et al</a>, is the problem.
However, we show now that the storage capacity is not directly responsible for the imperfect retrieval.
The storage capacity for <strong>retrieval of patterns free of errors</strong> is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
C \cong \frac{d}{2\log(d)} \ , \tag{7}
\label{eq:storage_hopfield}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where \(d\) is the dimension of the input.</p>

<p>The storage capacity for <strong>retrieval of patterns with a small percentage of errors</strong> is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
C \cong 0.14 d\ . \tag{8}
\label{eq:storage_hopfield2}
\end{equation}\]

<p>In the example, the storage capacity is \(C \cong 0.14 d = 0.14 \cdot 64 \cdot 64 \sim 570\).
Thus, insufficient storage capacity is not directly responsible for the retrieval errors.
Instead, the example patterns are correlated, therefore the retrieval has errors.</p>

<p>Consequently, we need a model which <strong>allows pulling apart close patterns</strong>, such that (strongly) <strong>correlated patterns can be distinguished</strong>.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>On storage capacity</strong></p>

<p>The storage capacities stated in Eq. \eqref{eq:storage_hopfield} and in Eq. \eqref{eq:storage_hopfield2} are derived for \(w_{ii}=0\).
Recently, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2016.00144/full">Folli et al.</a> analyzed the storage capacity for Hopfield Networks with \(w_{ii}\geq 0\). Also for \(w_{ii}\geq 0\), a storage capacity of \(C \cong 0.14 d\)
for retrieval of patterns with a small percentage of errors was observed. The ratio \(C/d\) is often called <strong>load parameter</strong> and denoted by \(\alpha\). <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2016.00144/full">Folli et al.</a> showed that there is a second regime with very large \(\alpha\), where the storage capacity is much higher, i.e. more fixed points exist. However, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07741">Rocci et al.</a> and <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/21/8/726/htm">Gosti et al.</a> reported that these fixed points for very large \(\alpha\) are unstable and do not have an attraction basin.</p>

<p>The storage capacity is a crucial characteristic of Hopfield Networks. <strong>Modern Hopfield Networks</strong> (aka Dense Associative Memories) introduce a new energy function instead of the energy in Eq. \eqref{eq:energy_hopfield} to create a higher storage capacity. <strong>Discrete</strong> modern Hopfield Networks have been introduced first by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01164">Krotov and Hopfield</a> …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>In my previous posts on loss aversion (<a href="https://jasoncollins.blog/2019/09/10/kahneman-and-tverskys-debatable-loss-aversion-assumption/">here</a>, <a href="https://jasoncollins.blog/2019/11/06/what-can-we-infer-about-someone-who-rejects-a-5050-bet-to-win-110-or-lose-100-the-rabin-paradox-explored/">here</a> and <a href="https://jasoncollins.blog/2019/12/05/the-case-against-loss-aversion/">here</a>), I foreshadowed a post on how “ergodicity economics” might shed some light on whether we need loss aversion to explain people’s choices under uncertainty. This was to be that post, but the background material that I drafted is long enough to be a stand alone piece. I’ll turn to the application of ergodicity economics to loss aversion in a future post.</p>
<p>The below is largely drawn from presentations and papers by <a href="https://ergodicityeconomics.com/">Ole Peters</a> and <a href="http://lml.org.uk/research/economics/">friends</a>, with my own evolutionary take at the end. For a deeper dive, see the <a href="https://ergodicityeconomics.com/lecture-notes/">lecture notes by Peters and Alexander Adamou</a>, or a recent <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-019-0732-0">Perspective by Peters in Nature Physics</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The choice</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you have $100 and are offered a gamble involving a series of coin flips. For each flip, heads will increase your wealth by 50%. Tails will decrease it by 40%. Flip 100 times.</p>
<p><strong>The expected payoff</strong></p>
<p>What will happen? For that first flip, you have a 50% chance of a $50 gain, and a 50% chance of a $40 loss. Your expected gain (each outcome weighted by its probability, 0.5*$50 + 0.5*-$40) is $5 or 5% of your wealth. The absolute size of the stake for future flips will depend on past flips, but for every flip you have the same expected gain of 5% of your wealth.</p>
<p>Should you take the bet?</p>
<p>I simulated 10,000 people who each started with $100 and flipped the coin 100 times each. This line in Figure 1 represents the mean wealth of the 10,000 people. It looks good, increasing roughly in accordance with the expected gain, despite some volatility, and finishing at a mean wealth of over $16,000.</p>
<p><em>Figure 1: Average wealth of population</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_1.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 1"></p>
<p>Yet people regularly decline gambles of this nature. Are they making a mistake?</p>
<p>One explanation for declining this gamble is risk aversion. A risk averse person will value the expected outcome of a gamble lower than the same sum with certainty.</p>
<p>Risk aversion can be represented through the concept of utility, where each level of wealth gives subjective value (utility) for the gambler. If people maximise utility instead of the value of a gamble, it is possible that a person would reject the bet.</p>
<p>For example, one common utility function to represent a risk averse individual is to take the logarithm of each level of wealth. If we apply the log utility function to the gamble above, the gambler will reject the offer of the coin flip. [The maths here is simply that the expected utility of the gamble is 0.5*<em>ln</em>(150) + 0.5*<em>ln</em>(60)=4.55, which is less than the utility of the sure $100, <em>ln</em>(100)=4.61.]</p>
<p><strong>The time average growth rate</strong></p>
<p>For a different perspective, below is the plot for the first 20 of these 10,000 people. Interestingly, only two people do better than break even (represented by the black line at $100). The richest has less than $1,000 at period 100.</p>
<p><em>Figure 2: Path of first 20 people</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_2.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 2"></p>
<p>What is happening here? The first plot shows that the average wealth across all 10,000 people is increasing. When we look at the first 20 individuals, their wealth generally declines. Even those that make money make less than the gain in aggregate wealth would suggest.</p>
<p>To show this more starkly, here is a plot of the first 20 people on a log scale, together with the average wealth for the full population. They are all below average in final wealth.</p>
<p><em>Figure 3: Plot of first 20 people against average wealth (log scale)</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_3.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 3"></p>
<p>If we examine the full population of 10,000, we see an interesting pattern. The mean wealth is over $16,000, but the median wealth after 100 periods is 51 cents, a loss of over 99% of the initial wealth. 54% of the population ends up with less than $1. 86% finishes with less than the initial wealth of $100. Yet 171 people end up with more than $10,000. The wealthiest person finishes with $117 million, which is over 70% of the total wealth of the population.</p>
<p>For most people, the series of bets is a disaster. It looks good only on average, propped up by the extreme good luck and massive wealth of a few people. The expected payoff does not match the experience of most people.</p>
<p><strong><em>Four possible outcomes</em></strong></p>
<p>One way to think about what is happening is to consider the four possible outcomes over the first two periods.</p>
<p>The first person gets two heads. They finish with $225. The second and third person get a heads and a tails (in different orders), and finish with $90. The fourth person ends up with $36.</p>
<p>The average across the four is $110.25, reflecting the compound 5% growth. That’s our positive picture. But three of the four lost money. As the number of flips increases, the proportion who lose money increases, with a rarer but more extraordinarily rich cohort propping up the average.</p>
<p><strong><em>Almost surely</em></strong></p>
<p>Over the very long-term, an individual will tend to get around half heads and half tails. As the number of flips goes to infinite, the number of heads and tails is “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely">almost surely</a>” equal.</p>
<p>This means that each person will tend to get a 50% increase half the time (or 1.5 times the initial wealth), and a 40% decrease half the time (60% of the initial wealth). A bit of maths and the time average growth in wealth for an individual is (1.5*0.6)<sup>0.5</sup> ~ 0.95, or approximately a 5% decline in wealth each period. Every individual’s wealth will tend to decay at that rate.</p>
<p>To get an intuition for this, a long run of equal numbers of heads and tails is equivalent to flipping a head and a tail every two periods. Suppose that is exactly what you did – flipped a heads and then flipped a tail. Your wealth would increase to $150 in the first round ($100*1.5), and then decline to $90 in the second ($150*0.6). You get the same result if you change the order. Effectively, you are losing 10% (or getting only 1.5*0.6=0.9) of your money every two periods.</p>
<p>A system where the time average converges to the ensemble average (our population mean) is known as an ergodic system. The system of gambles above is non-ergodic as the time average and the ensemble average diverge. And given we cannot individually experience the ensemble average, we should not be misled by it. The focus on ensemble averages, as is typically done in economics, can be misleading if the system is non-ergodic.</p>
<p><strong><em>The longer term</em></strong></p>
<p>How can we reconcile this expectation of loss when looking at the time average growth with the continued growth of the wealth of some people after 100 periods? It does not seem that everyone is “almost surely” on the path to ruin.</p>
<p>But they are. If we plot the simulation for, say, 1,000 periods rather than 100, there are few winners. Here’s a plot of the average wealth of the population for 1000 periods (the first 100 being as previously shown), plus a log plot of that same growth (Figures 4 and 5).</p>
<p><em>Figure 4: Plot of average wealth over 1000 periods</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_4.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 4"></p>
<p><em>Figure 5: Plot of average wealth over 1000 periods (log plot)</em><br>

<p>We can see that despite a large peak in wealth around period 400, wealth ultimately plummets. Average wealth at period 1000 is $24, below the starting average of $100, with a median wealth of 1×10<sup>-21</sup> (rounding to the nearest cent, that is zero). The wealthiest person has $242 thousand dollars, with that being 98.5% of the total wealth. If we followed that wealthy person for another 1000 generations, I would expect them to be wiped out too. [I tested that – at 2000 periods the wealthiest person had $4×10<sup>-7</sup>.] Despite the positive expected value, the wealth of the entire population is wiped out.</p>
<p><strong>Losing wealth on a positive value bet</strong></p>
<p>The first 100 periods of bets forces us to hold a counterintuitive idea in our minds. While the population as an aggregate experiences outcomes reflecting the positive expected value of the bet, the typical person does not. The increase in wealth across the aggregate population is only due to the extreme wealth of a few lucky people.</p>
<p>However, the picture over 1000 periods appears even more confusing. The positive expected value of the bet is nowhere to be seen. How could this be the case?</p>
<p>The answer to this lies in the distribution of bets. After 100 periods, one person had 70% of the wealth. We no longer have 10,000 equally weighted independent bets as we did in the first round. Instead, the path of the wealth of the population is largely subject to the outcome of the bets by this wealthy individual. As we have already shown, the wealth path for an individual almost surely leads to a compound 5% loss of wealth. That individual’s wealth is on borrowed time. The only way for someone to maintain their wealth would be to bet a smaller portion of their wealth, or to diversify their wealth across multiple bets.</p>
<p><strong>The Kelly criterion</strong></p>
<p>On the first of these options, the portion of a person’s wealth they should enter as stakes for a positive expected value bet such as this is given by the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion">Kelly Criterion</a>. The Kelly criterion gives the bet size that would maximise the geometric growth rate in wealth.</p>
<p>The Kelly criterion formula for a simple bet is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3D%5Cfrac%7Bbp-q%7D%7Bb%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7Bp%28b%2B1%29-1%7D%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=1" alt="f=\frac{bp-q}{b}=\frac{p(b+1)-1}{b}" title="f=\frac{bp-q}{b}=\frac{p(b+1)-1}{b}"></p>
<p>where</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <em>f</em> is the fraction of the current bankroll to wager</p>
<p>  <em>b</em> is the net odds received on the wager (i.e. you receive $b back on top of the $1 wagered for the bet)</p>
<p>  <em>p</em> is the probability of winning</p>
<p>  <em>q</em> is the probability of losing (1-p)
</p></blockquote>
<p>For the bet above, we have <em>p</em>=0.5 and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%3D%5Cfrac%7B0.5%7D%7B0.4%7D%3D1.25&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="b=\frac{0.5}{0.4}=1.25" title="b=\frac{0.5}{0.4}=1.25">. As offered, we are effectively required to bet <em>f</em>=0.4, or 40% of our wealth, for that chance to win a 50% increase.</p>
<p>However, if we apply the above formula given <em>p</em> and <em>b</em>, a person should bet <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%280.5%2A%281.25%2B1%29-1%29%7D%7B1.25%7D%3D0.1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\frac{(0.5*(1.25+1)-1)}{1.25}=0.1" title="\frac{(0.5*(1.25+1)-1)}{1.25}=0.1">, or 10%, of their wealth each round to maximise the geometric growth rate.</p>
<p>The Kelly criterion is effectively maximising the expected log utility of the bet through setting the size of the bet. The Kelly criterion will result in someone wanting to take a share of any bet with positive expected value.</p>
<p>The Kelly bet “almost surely”” leads to higher wealth than any other strategy in the long run.</p>
<p>If we simulate the above scenarios, but risking only 10% of wealth each round rather than 40% (i.e. heads wealth will increase by 12.5%, tails it will decrease by 10%), what happens? The expected value of the Kelly bet is 0.5*0.125+0.5*-0.1=0.0125 …</p></div></div>

<h3 id="insert-multiple-rows-in-one-statement">Insert Multiple Rows In One Statement</h3>

<p>The INSERT statement can insert more than one row in a single statement:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>planets</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>gravity</span><span>)</span>
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'earth'</span><span>,</span>    <span>9</span><span>.</span><span>8</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'mars'</span><span>,</span>     <span>3</span><span>.</span><span>7</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'jupiter'</span><span>,</span> <span>23</span><span>.</span><span>1</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="insert-a-row-and-return-automatically-assigned-values">Insert a Row and Return Automatically-assigned Values</h3>

<p>Values auto-generated with DEFAULT/serial/IDENTITY constructs can be returned
by the INSERT statement using the RETURNING clause. From the application
code perspective, such an INSERT is executed like a SELECT that returns a
recordset.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- table with 2 column values auto-generated on INSERT</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>slno</span>       <span>serial</span>      <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span><span>,</span>
    <span>name</span>       <span>text</span>        <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>
    <span>created_at</span> <span>timestamptz</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>now</span><span>()</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'wooden axe'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'loom'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'eye of ender'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>RETURNING</span> <span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>slno</span><span>,</span> <span>created_at</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- returns:</span>
<span>--      name     | slno |          created_at</span>
<span>-- --------------+------+-------------------------------</span>
<span>--  wooden axe   |    1 | 2020-08-17 05:35:45.962725+00</span>
<span>--  loom         |    2 | 2020-08-17 05:35:45.962725+00</span>
<span>--  eye of ender |    3 | 2020-08-17 05:35:45.962725+00</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="autogenerated-uuid-primary-keys">Autogenerated UUID Primary Keys</h3>

<p>UUIDs are sometimes used instead of primary keys for various reasons. Here is
how you can use an UUID instead of a serial or IDENTITY:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>EXTENSION</span> <span>IF</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>"uuid-ossp"</span><span>;</span>

<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>id</span>    <span>uuid</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>uuid_generate_v4</span><span>(),</span>
    <span>name</span>  <span>text</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'wooden axe'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'loom'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'eye of ender'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>RETURNING</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>;</span>
  
<span>-- returns:</span>
<span>--                   id                  |     name</span>
<span>-- --------------------------------------+--------------</span>
<span>--  1cfaae8c-61ff-4e82-a656-99263b7dd0ae | wooden axe</span>
<span>--  be043a89-a51b-4d8b-8378-699847113d46 | loom</span>
<span>--  927d52eb-c175-4a97-a0b2-7b7e81d9bc8e | eye of ender</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="insert-if-not-existing-update-otherwise">Insert If Not Existing, Update Otherwise</h3>

<p>In Postgres 9.5 and later, you can <em>upsert</em> directly using the ON CONFLICT
construct:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>parameters</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>key</span>   <span>TEXT</span> <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span><span>,</span>
    <span>value</span> <span>TEXT</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>-- when "key" causes a constraint violation, update the "value"</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>parameters</span> <span>(</span><span>key</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> 
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'port'</span><span>,</span> <span>'5432'</span><span>)</span>
<span>ON</span> <span>CONFLICT</span> <span>(</span><span>key</span><span>)</span> <span>DO</span>
            <span>UPDATE</span> <span>SET</span> <span>value</span><span>=</span><span>EXCLUDED</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="copy-rows-from-one-table-into-another">Copy Rows From One Table Into Another</h3>

<p>The INSERT statement has a form where the values can be supplied by a SELECT
statement. Use this to copy rows from one table into another:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- copy between tables with similar columns </span>
  <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>pending_quests</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>quests</span>
        <span>WHERE</span> <span>progress</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>100</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- supply some values from another table, some directly</span>
  <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>archived_quests</span>
       <span>SELECT</span> <span>now</span><span>()</span> <span>AS</span> <span>archival_date</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span>
         <span>FROM</span> <span>quests</span>
        <span>WHERE</span> <span>completed</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you’re looking to bulk-load tables, also check out the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html">COPY command</a>,
which can be used to insert rows from a text or CSV file.</p>

<h3 id="delete-and-return-deleted-information">Delete and Return Deleted Information</h3>

<p>You can use the <code>RETURNING</code> clause to return values from the rows that were
deleted using a bulk-delete statement:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- return the list of customers whose licenses were deleted after expiry</span>
<span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>licenses</span>
      <span>WHERE</span> <span>now</span><span>()</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>expiry_date</span>
  <span>RETURNING</span> <span>customer_name</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="move-rows-from-one-table-into-another">Move Rows From One Table Into Another</h3>

<p>You can move rows from one table to another in a single statement, by using CTEs
with <em>DELETE .. RETURNING</em>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- move yet-to-start todo items from 2020 to 2021</span>
<span>WITH</span> <span>ah_well</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>todos_2020</span>
          <span>WHERE</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>started</span>
      <span>RETURNING</span> <span>*</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>todos_2021</span>
            <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>ah_well</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="update-rows-and-return-updated-values">Update Rows and Return Updated Values</h3>

<p>The RETURNING clause can be used in UPDATEs too. Note that only the new
values of the updated columns can be returned this way.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- grant random amounts of coins to eligible players</span>
   <span>UPDATE</span> <span>players</span>
      <span>SET</span> <span>coins</span> <span>=</span> <span>coins</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>100</span> <span>*</span> <span>random</span><span>())::</span><span>integer</span>
    <span>WHERE</span> <span>eligible</span>
<span>RETURNING</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>coins</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you need the original value of the updated columns: it is possible through a
self-join, but there is no guarantee of atomicity. Try using a <code>SELECT .. FOR
UPDATE</code> instead.</p>

<h3 id="update-a-few-random-rows-and-return-the-updated-ones">Update a Few Random Rows and Return The Updated Ones</h3>

<p>Here’s how you can choose a few random rows from a table, update them and
return the updated ones, all in one go:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>WITH</span> <span>lucky_few</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span>
      <span>FROM</span> <span>players</span>
  <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>random</span><span>()</span>
     <span>LIMIT</span> <span>5</span>
<span>)</span>
   <span>UPDATE</span> <span>players</span>
      <span>SET</span> <span>bonus</span> <span>=</span> <span>bonus</span> <span>+</span> <span>100</span> 
    <span>WHERE</span> <span>id</span> <span>IN</span> <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>lucky_few</span><span>)</span>
<span>RETURNING</span> <span>id</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="create-a-table-just-like-another-table">Create a Table Just Like Another Table</h3>

<p>Use the CREATE TABLE .. LIKE construct to create a table with the same columns
as another:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>to_be_audited</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>purchases</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>By default this does not create similar indexes, constraints, defaults etc. To
do that, ask Postgres explicitly:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>to_be_audited</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>purchases</span> <span>INCLUDING</span> <span>ALL</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>See the full syntax <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="extract-a-random-set-of-rows-into-another-table">Extract a Random Set of Rows Into Another Table</h3>

<p>Since Postgres 9.5, the TABLESAMPLE feature is available to extract a sample of
rows from a table. There are two sampling methods currently, and <em>bernoulli</em> is
usually the one you want:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- copy 10% of today's purchases into another table</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>to_be_audited</span>
     <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span>
       <span>FROM</span> <span>purchases</span>
<span>TABLESAMPLE</span> <span>bernoulli</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span>
      <span>WHERE</span> <span>transaction_date</span> <span>=</span> <span>CURRENT_DATE</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <em>system</em> tablesampling method is faster, but does not return a uniform
distribution. See the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-select.html#SQL-FROM">docs</a>
for more info.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-table-from-a-select-query">Create a Table From a Select Query</h3>

<p>You can use the CREATE TABLE .. AS construct to create the table and populate
it from a SELECT query, all in one go:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>to_be_audited</span> <span>AS</span>
      <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span>
        <span>FROM</span> <span>purchases</span>
 <span>TABLESAMPLE</span> <span>bernoulli</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span>
       <span>WHERE</span> <span>transaction_date</span> <span>=</span> <span>CURRENT_DATE</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The resultant table is like a materialized view without a query associated with
it. Read more about <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html">CREATE TABLE .. AS here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="create-unlogged-tables">Create Unlogged Tables</h3>

<p><em>Unlogged</em> tables are not backed by WAL records. This means that updates and
deletes to such tables are faster, but they are not crash-tolerant and cannot
be replicated.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>UNLOGGED</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>report_20200817</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="create-temporary-tables">Create Temporary Tables</h3>

<p><em>Temporary</em> tables are implicitly unlogged tables, with a shorter lifetime. They
automatically self-destruct at the end of a session (default), or at the end
of the transaction.</p>

<p>Data within temporary tables cannot be shared across sessions. Multiple sessions
can create temporary tables with the same name.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- temp table for duration of the session</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TEMPORARY</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>scratch_20200817_run_12</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>);</span>

<span>-- temp table that will self-destruct after current transaction</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TEMPORARY</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>scratch_20200817_run_12</span>
                      <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>)</span>
                      <span>ON</span> <span>COMMIT</span> <span>DROP</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- temp table that will TRUNCATE itself after current transaction</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TEMPORARY</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>scratch_20200817_run_12</span>
                       <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>)</span>
                       <span>ON</span> <span>COMMIT</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>ROWS</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>



<p>Comments can be added to any object in the database. Many tools, including
pg_dump, understand these. A useful comment might just avoid a ton of trouble
during cleanup!</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>COMMENT</span> <span>ON</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>idx_report_last_updated</span>
        <span>IS</span> <span>'needed for the nightly report app running in dc-03'</span><span>;</span>

<span>COMMENT</span> <span>ON</span> <span>TRIGGER</span> <span>tgr_fix_column_foo</span>
        <span>IS</span> <span>'mitigates the effect of bug #4857'</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="advisory-locks">Advisory Locks</h3>

<p>Advisory locks can be used to co-ordinate actions between two apps connected to
the <em>same</em> database. You can use this feature to implement a global, distributed
mutex for a certain operation, for example. Read all about it <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html#ADVISORY-LOCKS">here in the
docs</a>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- client 1: acquire a lock </span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_advisory_lock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span>
<span>-- ... do work ...</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_advisory_unlock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span>

<span>-- client 2: tries to do the same thing, but mutually exclusive</span>
<span>-- with client 1</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_advisory_lock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span> <span>-- blocks if anyone else has held lock with id 130</span>

<span>-- can also do it without blocking:</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_try_advisory_lock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span>
<span>-- returns false if lock is being held by another client</span>
<span>-- otherwise acquires the lock then returns true</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="aggregate-into-arrays-json-arrays-or-strings">Aggregate Into Arrays, JSON Arrays or Strings</h3>

<p>Postgres provides aggregate functions that concatenate values in a <em>GROUP</em> to
yield arrays, JSON arrays or strings:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- get names of each guild, with an array of ids of players that</span>
<span>-- belong to that guild</span>

<h3 id="aggregates-with-order">Aggregates With Order</h3>

<p>While we’re on the topic, here’s how to set the order of values that are passed
to the aggregate function, <em>within each group</em>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- each state with a list of counties sorted alphabetically</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>states</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>string_agg</span><span>(</span><span>counties</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>','</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>counties</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>states</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>counties</span>
    <span>JOIN</span> <span>states</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>counties</span><span>.</span><span>state_name</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>states</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Yes, there is a trailing ORDER BY clause inside the function call paranthesis.
Yes, the syntax is weird.</p>

<h3 id="array-and-unnest">Array and Unnest</h3>

<p>Use the ARRAY constructor to convert a set of rows, each with one column, into
an array.  The database driver (like JDBC) should be able to map Postgres arrays
into native arrays and might be easier to work with.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- convert rows (with 1 column each) into a 1-dimensional array</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>ARRAY</span><span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>players</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>lifetime_spen…</span></code></pre></figure></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>With QFlow.ai coming out of beta, I wanted to share a bit about what QFlow.ai is and does, but also try to answer the question: why build QFlow.ai?</p>
<p>Let’s begin with the problem. Both I and my co-founder have spent years in executive
positions (CFO, VP Finance, VP Operations, VP Marketing, etc.) at B2B companies. At each company, between sales,
marketing, customer success, and finance, <strong>we had a lot of tools generating a lot of data</strong>. But our organizations were by and large
stuck with outdated tools and skills to analyze that data.</p>
<p>Content Launchpad</p>

<li><a href="#different-qflow-ai-plans">What differentiates plans?</a></li>
<li><a href="#what-is-next-for-qflow-ai">What’s next?</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.qflow.ai/images/DataSources.gif" alt="Lots of data, not much information"></p>
<h2 id="deceivingly-simple-but-important-questions-are-notoriously-difficult-to-answer-for-b2b-sales--marketing-professionals">Deceivingly simple but important questions are notoriously difficult to answer for B2B sales &amp; marketing professionals</h2>
<p>Often the simplest of questions that we ask of our data are difficult to answer reliably,
accurately, and efficiently. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does the customer acquisition journey look like, from marketing, to sales, to customer success?</li>
<li>What programs, marketing campaigns, and sales tools are yielding the best outcomes? What about relative to cost?</li>
<li>How much time is it taking for our sales reps to follow up on an inbound lead?</li>
<li>What happened to the opportunities that made up the $XX million dollars in last month’s sales forecast?</li>
<li>What types of outbound sales activities are yielding productive vs. unproductive outcomes? Which sales behaviors can we model our playbook around?</li>
<li>How can we more accurately predict conversions? How can we more accurately forecast renewals?</li>
<li>Can we fix lead scoring and build trust between sales and marketing?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="to-properly-analyze-a-b2b-business-a-data-warehouse-is-required-but-alone-is-insufficient">To properly analyze a B2B business, a data warehouse is required but alone is insufficient</h2>
<p>Addressing these questions with intellectual honesty turned out to be a slippery slope.
If we got engineering to stand up a data warehouse, we would then require a data engineering resource. If we got a data engineering resource, we
would then have to compete for her/his time and attention with more interesting projects.</p>
<p>And, even if we successfully had convinced a capable data engineer to help us maintain the data warehouse, that was just the
beginning. <strong>We would <em>still</em> need</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>heavy lifting in terms of data transformation, far beyond the capabilities of SQL</li>
<li>to overcome disagreements / the lack of belief in marketing attribution models</li>
<li>to get stakeholders onboard across sales, marketing, finance, customer success, etc.</li>
<li>analysts to partner with data engineers, <strong>so we could derive <em>useful information</em> from the data</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In short, we had data, but found that too often it resulted in little useful information. Managing our business meant we needed to <strong>discard
“intuition” and embrace complex data</strong>, which in turn meant upgrading our organization’s tool set and skill set.
This simply wasn’t feasible most of the time.</p>
<p>So we built QFlow.ai. Because B2B customer-facing teams deserve to use a modern data toolset and its benefits.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-qflow-ai">What is QFlow.ai?</h2>
<p>QFlow.ai is a platform that enables B2B businesses to adopt machine learning, embrace complexity, and quickly answer the
questions that matter most. It works not by generating more data, but by using the <strong>data that you already have from</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Salesforce.com (standard objects)</li>
<li>Your marketing automation platform (Marketo, Hubspot, Pardot, etc.)</li>
<li>Commonly used marketing platforms (e.g., Google Ads)</li>
<li>Optionally, any custom data that would be relevant to a machine learning model (more on that later)</li>
</ul>
<p>We built QFlow.ai specifically to capture the data needed to engineer a time series based dataset, with
an abstraction layer that sits on top and addresses idiosyncratic implementations of Salesforce.com.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with idiosyncratic business systems implementation, you might understandably have raised an eyebrow just now.</p>
<p>With the understanding each company is different, we built an account setup process that addresses differences in and
builds on  similarities in implementations. It works so well
that we’ve patented it.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.qflow.ai/images/qflow-ai-setup-wizard.png" alt="Simple setup abstracts away complexity"></p>
<p>Rather than spending days, weeks, or months setting up marketing attribution, our beta customers start getting value out of
QFlow.ai over the course of an early afternoon.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-qflowai-work">How does QFlow.ai work?</h2>
<p>Let’s address how QFlow.ai works at a high level.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, QFlow.ai creates a secure data warehouse for you and you alone — into which it pulls your corporate data</li>
<li>It uses existing data in your CRM and marketing platform to generate data visualizations and power machine learning recipes (more on that later)</li>
<li>It then re-assembles standard and, optionally, custom data to a format amenable to machine learning</li>
<li>And it works out of the box, requiring mere minutes of configuration — not days or months of setup / professional services
<img src="https://blog.qflow.ai/images/QFlow-Platform-Overview-Aug-2020.png" alt="QFlow Platform Basics"></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-does-qflow-ai-do">What are the capabilities of QFlow.ai?</h2>
<p>As of August 2020, the Standard Plan QFlow.ai includes the following major features:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://qflow.ai/products/attribution">multi-touch, multi-contact attribution</a></td>
<td>so marketing and sales can visualize what’s working to generate pipeline, and most importantly, deals</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://qflow.ai/products/campaign-measurement">campaign measurement views</a></td>
<td>so that companies can easily compare ARR generated to ongoing spend across sales and marketing programs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://qflow.ai/products/sales-activity">sales activity analytics</a></td>
<td>so companies can orient their outbound sales playbook around what works</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://qflow.ai/products/sales-productivity">pipeline analytics</a></td>
<td>because snapshot replay allows sales leaders to explain changes more easily and run tighter sales calls</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://qflow.ai/products/campaign-measurement">intuitive comment features</a></td>
<td>so teams can collaborate and communicate insights quickly</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>inbound response measurement (so new, there isn’t a link yet)</td>
<td>so you can measure how long it takes your sales team (or a bot) to respond to inbound leads</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://qflow.ai/products">integrations</a></td>
<td>with Salesforce.com, Pardot, Marketo, Hubspot, and Google Ads to get sales &amp; marketing data in one place</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="different-qflow-ai-plans">What differentiates QFlow.ai Standard from QFlow Pro? (Machine Learning Recipes)</h2>
<p>Originally, we planned on much more differentiation. But at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we made a decision to shove as much functionality as
possible into the QFlow.ai standard plan at a very low-friction price  ($699/mo paid annually, $899/mo paid monthly).</p>
<p>The primary difference between the two plans today is that <a href="https://qflow.ai/products/machine-learning">Machine Learning Recipes</a>
are available in Pro. This is not “machine learning” in a box. Instead, we’ve developed templates for machine learning
models that address common use cases in B2B. These templates are building blocks that, when deployed, are trained
and tuned machine learning models. <strong>We call these pre-built templates Machine Learning (ML) Recipes.</strong></p>
<p>Our two most popular Machine Learning recipes address <strong>lead scoring</strong> and <strong>opportunity scoring</strong>.</p>
<p>A typical Machine Learning recipe relies on standard information gleaned from your Salesforce.com and marketing platform integration,
but all recipes in our library can ingest <strong>custom data</strong> (e.g., product usage data, # API calls, seat utilization).</p>
<p>The inferred results from your ML jobs are available both on the QFlow.ai platform
and in your Salesforce.com instance. This way, your employees are able to orient their workday more intelligently without disruption.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.qflow.ai/images/p-convert-ml-recipe-process.png" alt="QFlow.ai Lead Scoring ML Recipe "></p>
<h2 id="what-is-next-for-qflow-ai">What’s on the roadmap for QFlow.ai</h2>
<p>We have built a lot in 9 short months, but there remains a lot to build. If you are a capable data scientist, devops
engineer, marketing or sales professional, or have a skill set that offers a unique contribution to our journey, we’re
interested talking with you about a fulfilling job.</p>
<p><strong>It’s been humbling to see our earliest customers use QFlow.ai transform the way that they approach generating and retaining B2B revenue
in a cost-effective way.</strong> During our limited private beta, QFlow.ai generated insights for customers that saved hundreds of thousands
of dollars in ineffective spend, increased forecastable pipeline for sales team by 2.4x, and measurably
worked to get marketing, sales, and finance teams on the same page.</p>
<p>So, what’s next? More building, more listening. An occasional blog post to try to let you know what we’re up to.
And a couple dedicated features for Customer Success teams to complement our ML recipe that predicts and helps mitigate churn.</p>
<p>When you’re ready to join us on this journey, let us know by <a href="https://qflow.ai/contact-us">scheduling a time for a demo</a>.
Until then, we’ll be hard at work.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to sort a list in Python, by following the below three steps:</p> <ol><li>Options to sort a list in Python<ul><li>What is the difference between “sort” and “sorted”</li><li>An example of using “sort”</li><li>An example of using “sorted”</li></ul></li><li>How to Sort a List in Reverse<ul><li>Sort a list in Reverse using “sort”</li><li>Sort a list in Reverse using “sorted”</li></ul></li><li>Sort with a Custom Function using Key</li></ol> <h2>1. Options to sort a list in Python</h2> <p>There exist two main options, those are <code>sort()</code> and <code>sorted()</code>, let’s explore them below.</p> <h3>What is the difference between “sort” and “sorted”</h3> <p><code>list.sort()</code> changes the list in place and returns <code>None</code>.</p> <p><code>sorted()</code> takes an iterable and returns a new list, sorted.</p> <h3>An example of using “sort”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = our_list.sort()

# print the new list
print(new_list)
# result: None

print(our_list)
# result: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'f', 'z']
</pre> <p>Notice how it changes the list itself, but does not return a value to be placed into a new variable.</p> <h3>An example of using “sorted”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = sorted(our_list)

# print the new list
print(new_list)

# result: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'f', 'z']
</pre> <p>Notice how the changes are saved to the new list/variable.</p> <h2>2. How to Sort a List in Reverse</h2> <p>Using the above functions, it’s simple to sort a list in reverse. Just specify the <code>reverse</code> argument and set it to <code>True</code>.</p> <h3>Sort a List in Reverse using “sort”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = our_list.sort(reverse=True)

print(our_list)
# result: ['z', 'f', 'c', 'b', 'a']
</pre> <h3>Sort a List in Reverse using “sorted”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = sorted(our_list, reverse=True)

# print the new list
print(new_list)

# result: ['z', 'f', 'c', 'b', 'a']
</pre> <h2>3. Sort with a Custom Function using Key</h2> <p>It is also possible to implement your own sorting method. This is done by adding a <code>key</code> parameter and setting it to a method.</p>  <p>For example:</p> <pre title=""># create a list of different length items
our_list = ["fasd", "asstt", "cqasf", "zqfwsef", "ba"]

# sort the list, by `len`
new_list = sorted(our_list, key=len)

# print the new list
print(new_list)

# result: ['ba', 'fasd', 'asstt', 'cqasf', 'zqfwsef']
</pre> <p>Just as we used <code>sorted</code> here, you could also have used <code>list.sort</code> as follows:</p> <pre title="">our_list.sort(key=len)
</pre> <p>As before, you can also combine the <code>reverse=True</code> argument should you want the reverse order.</p> <pre title="">our_list.sort(key=len, reverse=True)

# or

sorted(our_list, key=len, reverse=True)
</pre> <p>You could also swap out the use of the <code>len</code> method as the custom <code>key</code> with your own function, or lambda, to sort by some custom choice.</p> <p>For example:</p>  <pre title="">student_tuples = [('john', 'A', 15),('jane', 'B', 12),('dave', 'B', 10),]
sorted(student_tuples, key=lambda student: student[2]) 

# result: [('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('john', 'A', 15)]
</pre> <p>Or in another example:</p> <pre title="">lst = [('candy','30','100'), ('apple','10','200'), ('baby','20','300')]
lst.sort(key=lambda x:x[1])
print(lst)

# result: [('apple', '10', '200'), ('baby', '20', '300'), ('candy', '30', '100')]
</pre>  </div></div>]]>

<p id="6cad">Let’s take a closer look at the technical aspects of this technology (Global Positioning Systems), starting with the satellites and working our way down to the receivers on the ground.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/468/1*rBAMjm_JHGi1SBqs8vgu5g.png?resize=586%2C350&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" width="586" height="350" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/468/1*rBAMjm_JHGi1SBqs8vgu5g.png?resize=586%2C350&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>NavStar GPS satellite</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2 id="2fbd">Background Info</h2>



<p id="2901">The&nbsp;<strong>Global Positioning System (GPS)</strong>, originally known as&nbsp;<strong>NavStar</strong>, was created by the US military back in 1995. NavStar was originally a collection of over two dozen GPS satellites in geosynchronous orbit.</p>



<p id="b621">Nowadays, NavStar has grown to a network of over 30 satellites orbiting the Earth approximately 13,000 miles above the surface. These satellites make two passes over the same spot every day as they move in their west to east orbit.</p>



<p id="a1d9">While other countries are developing their own GPS satellite networks, the US NavStar system is still the standard.</p>



<p id="ab50">Only 24 satellites are needed to provide line of sight coverage to 95% of Earth’s surface. The remaining function primarily as backup and are queried only when more accuracy is needed.</p>



<h2 id="b2ef">Satellites</h2>



<p id="491c">The most critical component on board these satellites is the&nbsp;<strong>atomic clock</strong>. As you’ll soon see, reliable timekeeping is the single most important function of these satellites.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/1500/1*dZQbtHhY_4vNde3GlVOYLg.jpeg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/1500/1*dZQbtHhY_4vNde3GlVOYLg.jpeg?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>This atomic clock was built for the first GPS satellites in the late 1970s.</figcaption></figure>



<blockquote><p>“Atomic clocks are designed to measure the precise length of a second, the base unit of modern timekeeping. The International System of Units (SI) defines the second as the time it takes a caesium-133 atom in a precisely defined state to oscillate exactly: 9 billion, 192 million, 631 thousand, 770 times.”</p><p>— Live Science</p></blockquote>



<p id="fb6e"><strong>GPS Payload</strong></p>



<p id="2528">GPS is inherently a passive system. The GPS satellites do not receive any information.</p>



<p id="ed4f">Instead, each satellite reports at regular intervals:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Pseudo Random Code</strong>&nbsp;— an identification value for the satellite (used by the receiver to decode the signal)</li><li><strong>Almanac Data&nbsp;</strong>— the position of the satellite at any given moment in time and orbital information about all other active satellites (this informs the receiver about which satellites should be available and at what time -helping the receiver to more quickly acquire a GPS fix)</li><li><strong>Ephemeris Data</strong>&nbsp;— more specific information about the satellite: it’s current date, time, health, and location. This data is broadcasted approximately every 30 seconds by NavStar satellites. Ephemeris data is usually updated every 2 hours and is valid for 4 hours.</li></ol>



<h2 id="51d9">From A Cold Start</h2>



<p id="66be">Despite the frequency of the broadcast, the almanac alone is generally not accurate enough for a GPS receiver to get a location fix — especially if the GPS receiver is launching from a cold start.</p>



<p id="aec2">More often that not, the cached almanac information of the GPS receiver will be out of date, so some receivers — especially older ones — may have to wait upwards of 10 minutes to receive a full almanac and ephemeris data broadcast from each satellite before they can provide a GPS fix.</p>



<p id="064f">Additionally, ephemeris data has a natural expiry as it can’t be cached for too long due to clock drift. Waiting for the broadcast and reception of updated ephemeris data is the main cause for the long start time of GPS receivers.</p>



<h4 id="3be9"><strong>A-GPS</strong></h4>



<p id="1491">Luckily most modern devices, like today’s smartphones, are able to minimize this wait time. Most modern mobile devices use a variant of traditional GPS technology called A-GPS ( Assisted Global Positioning System) that helps them acquire a GPS fix quickly.</p>



<p id="07cf">A-GPS works by leveraging the phone’s data connection to contact an assistance server. The server will provide the almanac and ephemeris data directly, so the phone no longer needs to wait for the transmission from the satellite. However, once you are out of cell coverage, the phone would then revert back to the onboard GPS unit and will need several minutes to acquire the ephemeris and almanac data in the traditional manner.</p>



<h4 id="a00a"><strong>GPS Signal</strong></h4>



<p id="aa56">Most GPS transmissions are in the UHF portion of the frequency spectrum. Most civilian GPS communication is done on&nbsp;<strong>1575.42&nbsp;<em>MHz</em>&nbsp;</strong>or<strong>&nbsp;<em>1227.60 MHz</em></strong>.</p>



<p id="1531">Additionally, GPS signal uses CDMA spread-spectrum techniques in order to allow all satellites to transmit on the same frequency without interfering with one another.</p>



<h4 id="aae1"><strong>GPS Transmission</strong></h4>



<p id="52c8">According to RadioElectronics, standard GPS transmission is roughly 15000 bits in length and is transmitted at a rate of 50 bits / second — taking about 30 seconds to complete the transmission.</p>



<p id="9c18">The frame is split up into 5 sub-frames each 300 bits in length with a transmission time of 6 seconds.</p>



<p id="b0d2">The frames help the receiver identify the start and end of the transmission so they can easily synchronize with the incoming signals and decode the transmission.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Sub-Frame 1:&nbsp;</strong>Clock, GPS Time, Health of Satellite, Satellite ID</p><p><strong>Sub-Frame 2–3:</strong>&nbsp;Ephemeris Data</p><p><strong>Sub-Frame 4–5:</strong>&nbsp;Almanac Data</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="c16d">Receiver</h2>



<h4 id="950a">Trilateration</h4>



<p id="9d46">GPS, on the receiver side, works by using an approach called&nbsp;<strong>trilateration</strong>.</p>



<p id="2646">Imagine I told you I was 150 miles from Los Angeles, 200 miles from Las Vegas, and 75 miles from your Fresno.</p>



<p id="83f1">With just those 3 distance values, you would be able to determine a region that matches these constraints and would be able to estimate my current location within that region. The more distance measurements you have, the more accurate your estimate of my location becomes.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/526/1*PZaGjJw3W-TQl3DmkpahjA.png?resize=578%2C558&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" width="578" height="558" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/526/1*PZaGjJw3W-TQl3DmkpahjA.png?resize=578%2C558&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Trilateration Example</figcaption></figure></div>



<p id="c6d2">GPS requires at minimum distances to 3 satellite in order to get a fix on your location. As we already known, GPS signals include the location of the satellite and the time according to the satellite’s internal clock. If we measure the time that we receive the message and compare the difference in time to the time the message was sent from the satellite, we can figure out how long the message was in transit. Additionally, knowing that all of these signals are sent at the speed of light, we can multiply these two values together to compute your straight line distance to a particular satellite.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/proxy/0*HY7l7PcoJBE_eqXK.jpg?resize=582%2C422&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" width="582" height="422" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/proxy/0*HY7l7PcoJBE_eqXK.jpg?resize=582%2C422&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p id="b6c2">Satellites use expensive atomic clocks for this very reason. The more accurate the time value transmitted, the more accurate the receiver can be about it’s distance to the satellite.</p>



<p id="7cc7">Though we can figure out a user’s 2D location using just 3 satellites, using a 4th satellite allows us to compute an altitude value. While a 2D location fix might work for some cases as GPS would assume you’re near sea level, if you were on a mountain, a 2D fix could have an error of several hundred meters.</p>



<p id="5d42">Furthermore, because receivers — like a mobile phone — often have cheaper less accurate clocks — we need to account for the timing error introduced by the cheaper hardware and other environmental factors (decreases in the signal’s speed caused by the ionosphere and the troposphere). Using a 4th satellite will not only provide an altitude value, but it will allow us to solve a system of equations that let’s us identify the clock error and compute a more accurate position.</p>



<p id="30e2">Most modern GPS receivers will use this additional information to try and synchronize their internal clock with the satellite’s atomic clock.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/468/1*VV60PICUN4Xnwt6tphqNDQ.png?resize=579%2C297&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" width="579" height="297" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/468/1*VV60PICUN4Xnwt6tphqNDQ.png?resize=579%2C297&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p id="44af">That’s why most modern GPS receivers will typically track all available line of sight satellites, but only use some subset for the actual calculation.</p>



<p id="4221">Now that the GPS receiver’s antenna can pick up at least 4 satellites, it can accurately calculate it’s position and time in 3 dimensions (latitude, longitude, and altitude).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
		
<p>If you’re like me, you’ve wondered how sites like Facebook, Reddit, and Instagram are able to tell you whether a username has been taken so quickly. It seemed like these services were able to search through hundreds of millions of user records to verify the uniqueness of a prospective username in no time at all.</p>



<p>After some research, I came across the data structure that is responsible for this speed – a probabilistic data structure called the bloom filter.</p>



<h2>Overview</h2>



<p>Bloom filters share some similarities with traditional sets. Generally speaking, a set will tell you with certainty whether it contains a particular element or not. Bloom filters, however, make a slightly different promise. </p>



<p>They are probabilistic data structures which means they’ll tell you with certainty whether an element is <em><strong>not</strong></em> in the set and they’ll tell you if it is <em><strong>probably</strong></em> in the set. In other words, there’s a chance that bloom filters will return a false positive. That is, they’ll incorrectly claim that the set contains an element that was never added.</p>



<p>Maybe you’re wondering why a data structure that can only probably tell you if it contains an element is useful? Well, bloom filters are extremely fast and memory-efficient as we’ll soon see. Sometimes the speed and scalability of a solution are more important than the occasional false positives. In practice, if you know what your acceptable false positive rate is, you can calculate an initial size for the bloom filter to guarantee that rate.</p>



<h2>Implementation</h2>



<p>Bloom filters are simply a bit array of <em><code>m</code> </em>bits all initially set to 0. We’ll also need <em><code>k</code></em> different hash functions. These functions will be run over whatever item we are trying to add to the set and will return the indices in the bloom filter to turn from a 0 to a 1.</p>



<p>It’s important that whatever hash functions we choose create a uniform random distribution for best results. There are many industry standard options to pick from: HashMix, murmur, and the fnv series – just to name a few. </p>



<p>Generally, the number of hash functions needed would be a small constant derived from whatever false positive rate is acceptable for your use case. </p>



<h2>Initialization</h2>



<p>Let’s take an empty bloom filter and add an element to it.</p>



<p><code>let size = 10</code></p>



<p><code>let bloomFilter = Array(repeating: false, count: size)&nbsp;</code></p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2>Adding an element</h2>



<p>To add an element, we’ll take the element we want to add and pass it to all <code><em>k</em></code> hash functions to get <code><em>k</em></code> array indices. We’ll set the value at those indices to 1.</p>



<blockquote><p>In practice, these would not be 3 distinct hashing algorithms. Instead, it’d likely be the same algorithm just seeded with a different value (i.e. <em>1 … k</em>) which will generate <em>k</em> distinct hash functions.</p></blockquote>



<p><code>bloomFilter[hashAlgorithm1(“digital”) % size] = true</code></p>



<p><code>bloomFilter[hashAlgorithm2(“digital”) % size] = true</code></p>



<p><code>bloomFilter[hashAlgorithm3(“digital”) % size] = true</code></p>







<p>Now, it might look something like this:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>And after adding a few more entries to the set:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">1</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2>Querying</h2>



<p>If we wanted to query for an element, we’d do the same operations to get the k array indices. Then, if any of the bits at those indices are 0, we know definitively that the value is not in the set. Instead, if all of the indices values are 1, we know that the value is probably<em> </em>in the set – remember it could still be a false positive.&nbsp;</p>



<p><code>bloomFilter.search(“digital”)</code> which in turn calls:</p>



<p><code>bloomFilter[hashAlgorithm1(“digital”) % size] // 2</code></p>



<p><code>bloomFilter[hashAlgorithm2(“digital”) % size] // 6</code></p>



<p><code>bloomFilter[hashAlgorithm3(“digital”) % size] // 7</code></p>



<p>So, to check if the element is in the set, we just need to check indices 2,6, and 7 and verify they are set to 1.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center"><span><strong>1</strong></span></td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center"><strong>1</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>1</strong></td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>So, now we know that “digital” is probably in the set.</p>



<h2>Limitations</h2>



<p>It’s important to understand that elements can only be added to bloom filters and never removed. We can’t reset particular bits back to 0 because we don’t know if there’s some other element in the set that also maps to those indices. For example, after passing through the hash functions, “dog” and “cat” might share the exact same indices. </p>



<p>Remember the filter isn’t storing the data anywhere unlike traditional sets, arrays, etc, it’s just turning on certain indices.&nbsp;So, there’s no way of checking what word a particular set of indices relates to. </p>



<h2>Big O</h2>



<p>Implementing bloom filters requires us to specify the size upfront, so we can’t enlarge the data structure later. As a result, the more elements we add to the filter, the higher the error rate rises. So, it’s important to choose an initial size for the bloom filter that can scale with your data and allows you to keep a maintainable error rate.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>add(): O(k)<code>&nbsp;</code></p><p>contains(): O(k)</p><p>where k is the number of hash functions. </p></blockquote>



<p>One of the key advantages of bloom filters is that the time to add or check for inclusion in the set is constant; it’s completely independent of the number of items in the set.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Wrapping up</h2>



<p>Bloom filters are used everywhere. Chances are in just getting to this site you’ve encountered one. Chrome uses a local Bloom filter to store malicious URLs. Before navigating to a site, the browser will check if the site exists in the set of malicious URLs and if it does it’ll perform a full check on Google’s servers.&nbsp;</p>

<p id="fa89">This week’s edition — edge detection in images. More specifically we’ll be taking a closer look at the Sobel Edge Detection algorithm.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/1270/1*3hDhkzqJStXTp37lS_M5aA.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/1270/1*3hDhkzqJStXTp37lS_M5aA.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p id="3f05">Let’s start from the beginning.</p>



<h2 id="77be">Grayscale Images</h2>



<p id="7b79">The Sobel algorithm works by measuring the varying pixel intensity in an image. Naturally, this is easiest to accomplish when the image is a standardized grayscale image.</p>



<p id="f1c5">There are several algorithms to generate grayscale images — the simplest being an average of the R,G, and B values in a pixel.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/109/1*A-ZtS4G-IVhhDb4qboYYWQ.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/109/1*A-ZtS4G-IVhhDb4qboYYWQ.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p id="53f5">Then, we re-assign these new intensity values to the R,G, and B fields of the original pixel. Any situation where all the R,G, and B values are the same will give you a shade of gray (remember&nbsp;<em>#00000</em>&nbsp;is black and #<em>FFFFFF</em>&nbsp;is white).</p>



<p id="105e">However, though this often gives good results, the following grayscale function uses a weighted average that is better aligned with how the human eye interprets different colors and the transition between them.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/227/1*llWVqAtpyl65W0V7lqQjUA.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/227/1*llWVqAtpyl65W0V7lqQjUA.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p id="bd35">Regardless of which formula we use, we now have a grayscale image that we can apply the Sobel Edge Detection algorithm too.</p>



<h2 id="ae13">Sobel Detection Algorithm</h2>



<p id="d390">The Sobel algorithm was developed by Irwin Sobel and Gary Feldman at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) in 1968.</p>



<p id="b93f">In the simplest terms, their algorithm works by running a 3×3 matrix&nbsp;<em>(</em>known as the&nbsp;<em>kernel)&nbsp;</em>over all the pixels in the image. At every iteration, we measure the change in the gradient of the pixels that fall within this 3×3 kernel. The greater the change in pixel intensity, the more significant the edge there is.</p>



<h2 id="b7e3">Convolution</h2>



<p id="43f6">The algorithm relies heavily on a mathematical operation called convolution.</p>



<p id="a297">Convolution is simply the process of multiplying and adding corresponding indices of two matrices together (the kernel and the image matrix) after flipping both the rows and the columns of the kernel.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/1704/1*h3mCQcE71ayqzhphzindrQ.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/1704/1*h3mCQcE71ayqzhphzindrQ.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>The kernel on the left has its rows and columns flipped and then multiplied by the corresponding indices in the image matrix.</p>



<p id="7d73">The standard implementation of the algorithm uses the following 3×3 matrices for the&nbsp;<em>x&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>y</em>&nbsp;axis, respectively.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/974/1*8IyZO5lbk8Nk37opXhl0sQ.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/974/1*8IyZO5lbk8Nk37opXhl0sQ.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>Pre-Convoluted Kernel (A is a matrix containing the image data)</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/455/1*VfpLiujnVqszZneW6zxQdA.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/455/1*VfpLiujnVqszZneW6zxQdA.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>Convoluted version of the kernel above</p>



<p id="a71c">Now, we have completed all of the pre-processing and have the convoluted matrices in hand.</p>



<p id="d5af">We can iterate through all pixels in the original image and apply the image convolution kernels Gx and Gy at every step of the way. This convolution operation will return a single integer for each kernel.</p>



<p id="ea00">Here’s an example of what applying the Gx kernel on a specific pixel (in red) would look like:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/468/1*K6WODRbRy-jXSjrxkO2OUg.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/468/1*K6WODRbRy-jXSjrxkO2OUg.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>On the left is the original image with the 3×3 pixel group colored</p>



<p id="0fa7">The penultimate step is to create a new image of the same dimensions as the original image and store for the pixel data, the magnitude of the two gradient values:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/584/1*dY_BnICdMcnm9eyu9p7zwQ.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/584/1*dY_BnICdMcnm9eyu9p7zwQ.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p id="66aa">A recommended next step would be to normalize all of the data in the new image by dividing all the pixel values by the greatest gradient magnitude observed.</p>



<p id="414d">Now, you have a new grayscale image whose pixel intensities reflects how close they are to an edge in the original image. Naturally, the higher the gradient value for the pixel, the brighter the edge in the resultant image will appear.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/300/1*jX_A7jlhirg46m7whnJsKw.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/300/1*jX_A7jlhirg46m7whnJsKw.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Sobel Edge Detection Result</figcaption></figure></div>

Unemployment rose to levels not seen since the Great Depression.</p><p>Shortly afterwards states around the country passed emergency laws to protect the most vulnerable people. In 32 states, governors and public utility commissions (PUCs) passed <strong>utility shut-off moratoriums</strong> to ensure that no households lost their electricity because they couldn’t pay their bill.</p><p>Six months later many of those moratoriums have expired or are set to expire in the next month. Between May and mid-August, 10 states allowed their moratoriums to expire. In the next month another 14 state moratoriums will expire. That means <strong>by October 1st a total of 36 states won’t have moratoriums in place.</strong></p><p>In order to understand the impact of these policy changes, Carbon Switch analyzed data provided by public utility commissions in these states, unemployment data, and energy spending data. Our goal was to understand how many people could be at risk of losing their electricity this year.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="2104617" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="847ece8" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="8833eed" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><h3>Key highlights</h3><ul><li><strong>In the next month 34.5 million households will lose their utility shutoff protections as moratoriums in 14 states expire.</strong> About 4 million of those households are currently below the federal poverty line. 4 million people in those states are unemployed.</li><li><strong>76 million American households won’t have utility shutoff moratoriums after October 1st.</strong> By that point moratoriums will be voluntary in 36 states. About 10 million of the households in those states are currently below the federal poverty line.

When the statewide moratorium expires on September 1st they will all be at risk of losing their power.</li><li><strong>8 of the country’s 10 biggest utilities will shut off customers’ power by Sept 15.</strong> These utilities serve 53 million Americans. The only two utilities that won’t resume shut offs by September 15th are PG&amp;E and SCE, California-based utilities that legally can’t resume shutoffs until at least next year due to the state’s moratorium.</li><li><strong>Black families are twice as likely to have their power shut off as white families.</strong> According to the 2009 United States Energy Information Administration’s Residential Energy Consumption Survey African American households at or below 150% of the federal poverty level were shut off twice as frequently as white households (11.3% compared to 5.5%).</li><li><strong>Utility shutoffs cost lives, people’s health, and their dignity.</strong> Every year brings stories of people killed after their power is shut off (often due to fires and heat stroke).

As they wrote: “Between April 1 and June 30, 1,369,786 residential customer accounts have become eligible for disconnection but have not been disconnected.”</p><p>For context, there are 3,815,392 households in North Carolina meaning that more than a third of households are behind on payments.</p><p>Unfortunately little has changed in North Carolina since that July 15 report and the moratorium is set to expire on September 1st. According to the most recent BLS data, there are 419,812 unemployed people in the state (compared to 199,494 a year ago).</p><p>Wisconsin is another state that released data on how many customers are behind on their utility bills. According to <a href="https://www.wpr.org/sites/default/files/5-ui-120_data_update_august_2020.pdf">a recent government report</a> about 33% of utility customers were behind on payments as of July (compared to 12% a year ago).</p><p>When surveyed for that report, 36 of the 41 utilities that responded said they planned to resume shutoffs.

Few of them specified when they would resume shutoffs. Many of them have quietly resumed shutting off the power on their customers in the months since. While others plan to resume shutoffs in mid-September. One of the country’s biggest utilities, Southern Company — a Georgia-based utility with 9 million customers — never had an internal shutoff moratorium in the first place.</p><p>Carbon Switch gathered data on the number of customers at the 10 largest utilities and their shut off policies. We found that the top 10 utilities control 62% of the investor-owned utility market and serve 63 million customers. (It’s important to note that a customer is a household, not an individual. Considering the average household in America has 2.5 people, their policies likely affect about 157.5 million Americans).</p><p>Here’s a summary of these utilities shutoff policies during the pandemic:</p><ul><li>1 utility (Southern Company) never stopped shutting off their customers’ power.</li><li>3 utilities (Exelon, Xcel, and Florida Power and Light) quietly resumed shutoffs in May and July.</li><li>4 utilities (Duke Energy, Dominion Energy, First Energy, and AEP) plan to resume shut offs in September.</li><li>2 utilities (PG&amp;E and SCE) are barred by California’s moratorium from shutting off their customers’ power until at least next year.</li></ul><p>It’s worth emphasizing that the only utilities that have extended their moratoriums past September 15th are the two utilities based in California, a state with the nation’s longest spanning moratorium. The others plan to resume shut offs despite recent reports that as many as a third of customers are behind on payments in some states.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="b958695" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default"><div><p><img width="1240" height="974" src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1240/https://carbonswitch.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/table-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1240/https://carbonswitch.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/table-2.png 1240w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://carbonswitch.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/table-2-300x236.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://carbonswitch.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/table-2-1024x804.png 1024w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_768/https://carbonswitch.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/table-2-768x603.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1240px) 100vw, 1240px"></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="bbfb297" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="fb983df" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="e7cba1b" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><h3>Shutoffs and injustice</h3><p>In 2018 a 72-year-old woman living in Sun City West, Arizona died during a heat wave in which temperatures reached 100 degrees.

		<p>by David L. Duffy.</p>
<p>Personally, I have found some chess analogies, metaphors and thought experiments from philosophers a little unimpressive, speaking as someone who was once a middling club player. Some philosophers have been what I think of as serious players – at least one has been an International Master — but I don’t see their thoughts as widely cited as, for example, Dennett in the case of “Chmess”, or even Sellars’ “Texas Chess”. Serious chess players know there is a technical literature of many thousands of books, and databases containing ~15 million games played since people started recording them. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> They know playing chess is intensely pleasurable and addictive, that winning well is a joy, but even losing is not so bad. Abuhamdeh and Csikzentmihalyi found that maximum pleasure in their study was felt when one’s opponent was 260 Elo points <em>stronger</em> (that is, one’s chance of winning was only 20%). <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> Csikzentmihalyi calls chess as played by humans <em>autotelic;</em>&nbsp;that is, intrinsically motivating. Chess players know that chess-thought combines a mixture of “intuitive” pattern recognition and brute force mental visualisation of the future chess positions that will follow particular sequences of moves (“calculation”). They know and enjoy a family of variant forms of chess – I used to play a lot of “Transfer” (known as “Bughouse” in the US), which involves players passing captured pieces to their teammates, who may place them on their board, a la Shogi, but all under a time limit, as well as Kriegspiel where you and your opponent are unaware of each others’ moves, but are informed about captures and checks. <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Chess has been of great interest to the computer science community as what was seen as a hard problem for “machines do[ing] the things that would require intelligence if done by men” (Minsky 1968). Now <em>AlphaZero </em>has reached the highest levels in just 24 hours of self-play, it is seen as a trivial mechanical task, much easier than walking without falling over, or working out that the truck in front of your car is not the sky. <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> When I played through the originally published <em>AlphaZero</em> chess games, I found them hilarious. They actually have a very human feel, as opposed to those played by conventional chess engines which search through the set of all possible moves a certain number of plies into the future of the current position. (Partly this was because neither program was using standard opening books.) <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> &nbsp;<em>AlphaZero</em>’s open source successor <em>lz0</em> (<em>Leela</em>) has a putative Elo rating of ~3400, about the same as <em>Stockfish</em>, while the best human is ~2800 (so the human might beat the program perhaps one game in a hundred). <a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> &nbsp;Computer programs don’t enjoy chess, and don’t have an aesthetic response to beautiful combinations of moves. But the pleasures of the chess player are “merely” the subjective experience of successfully meeting a meta-cognitive goal, one that drives all playfulness, and the related goals of the aesthetics of thought. We get a dopamine rush from our comprehension of elegance, simplicity and complexity, and of surprise (some may remember Koestler’s <em>Ha!</em> and <em>Aha!</em>).</p>
<p>The rest of this essay will be a few comments about how various philosophers have interacted with the game of chess and the playing of chess, but before that I will present a little thought experiment of my own. Many comparisons have been made between the acts of playing chess and carrying out mathematical calculations or solving mathematical problems. If one is some kind of Chess Platonist, one has the image of a Universe of approximately 10<sup>40</sup> possible sequences of moves sitting out there. <a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> The Dancing Pixies argument of Putnam, Searle, Bishop, and others is that, with the right interpretation, the interactions between atoms in a rock are computations and thus, for us computationalists, thought. <a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp; They could also be interpreted as all those chess games. So I now have a concretized Platonic Chess Universe sitting in my garden. One merely needs to <em>construct</em> the apparatus to extract the games from the rock, and if one wished to use these to beat your human opponent, construct a further method of filtering out all the winning games arising from the current position. There are a couple of stories in Stanislaw Lem’s <em>Cyberiad</em> that are relevant, but Mrs Beeton’s recipe for Stewed Rabbit may also apply. <a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>(1) If I were asked to answer, in one sentence, the question “What was Wittgenstein’s biggest contribution?”, I should answer “His asking of the question ‘Can one play chess without the queen?’” (Wisdom 1952) <a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;Well, people spot weaker players a queen all the time, and don’t think anything of it. After all, you can lose your queen during a game anyway, and the resulting play is a subtype of standard play (usually endgame), rather than a new game. If one is playing the Old Indian Opening, for example, the players can choose to enter a Queen-less game in 5 moves. You might refine Wittgenstein and ask whether introducing a new set of rules specifying starting from a particular position (that is, setup of pieces on the board), or playing under the standard rules to get there is the same. Like, there are 10<sup>40</sup> different games lurking in there that people had never noticed before. In the Old Indian example, the players collaborate to reach a Queen-less board, but they may collaborate in all kinds of ways, such as repeatedly playing a particular chess opening variant they are both interested in (or in a grandmaster draw, as a strategy for winning a chess tournament).</p>
<p>(2) From Dummett’s explication of Frege on chess:</p>
<p><span>Proposition 1</span>: <em>Neither chess moves nor positions on the chessboard express anything; in particular they do not express thoughts that can be evaluated as true or false.</em> Proposition 2: <em>The theory of chess consists of meaningful propositions about chess moves and chess positions, capable of demonstration in the same way as mathematical theorems. </em><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p>These seem plausible, but the way I think of chess soon led me to:</p>
<p><span>Analogical Proposition 1</span>: Neither bead moves nor positions on the abacus express anything; in particular they do not express thoughts that can be evaluated as true or false.</p>
<p><span>Analogical Proposition 2</span>: The theory of abacus use consists of meaningful propositions about bead moves and positions, capable of demonstration in the same way as mathematical theorems.</p>
<p>I think it obvious that AP1 and AP2 are incorrect. My preferred interpretation for the abacus: Bead movements and positions concretely express the evolution and states of abstract entities in a virtual time and space, whose properties are chosen to simulate those of other concrete objects.</p>
<p>My preferred interpretation for chess: Chess moves and positions on the chessboard concretely express the evolution and states of abstract entities in a virtual time and space, whose properties are chosen to simulate the concrete objects, actions and decisions of soldiers.</p>
<p>A: chess is a war game.</p>
<p>B: The warfare modeled by the rules of chess is ancient Indian warfare, with peasant infantry, elephants, aristocratic cavalry and chariots.</p>
<p>C: Winning such a battle required the capture or death of the opposition king.</p>
<p>D: Winning usually requires the general to sacrifice many of his own soldiers in order to win, unless the opponent has made an error.</p>
<p>E: A general fights against another general, and usually will plan as if his opponent will make the best response to any given attack, although he will set up traps with the hope they will succumb.</p>
<p>F: Each wields a Theory of Mind that is domain specific, and must incorporate both low-level and high-level properties of the game or the organisation of fighting. For example, chess players and generals both divide up the elements of planning into strategy and tactics.</p>
<p>My preferred conclusion: Although the game is greatly abstracted, there are many high-level analogies to warfare.</p>
<p>As it happens, Deleuze and Guattari make much of these isomorphisms in <em>A Thousand Plateaus&nbsp;</em>, as in the State of chess versus the Nomads of Go/Wei Chi – “chess pieces entertain biunivocal relations with one another, and with the adversary’s pieces: their functioning is structural, while Go pieces… have extrinsic relations with nebulae or constellations”, and so on. <a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>My mental model of chess as simulation is therefore similar to a scientific model. There is the reality, the model that abstracts certain features of reality, and the theory that applies to the model. In a game, the pleasures arise in implementing and running the model, but are related to some of those of the reality (this is far more obvious in modern computer games). <a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>

<p>At the moment, the Epic Games page in the App Store is not available – journalist John Voorhees was one of the first to notice this. The store gives an error whenever you try to go to the page of the company itself or one of its applications using a direct link, but you cannot find it in the search.</p>




<p>Users also noted that downloading apps from Epic, including Fortnite, will not work, even if they are already assigned to a user account.</p>



<figure><img src="https://nintendosmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/apple.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://nintendosmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/apple.jpg 289w, https://nintendosmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/apple-195x300.jpg 195w" sizes="(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px"></figure>



<p>Apple released an official statement on this matter – the company noted that they were “very sorry” to take such measures, but Epic left no choice.</p>



<blockquote><p>The court recommended that Epic follow the App Store’s guidelines and policies while the case is in progress – the rules they followed over the past ten years until they created the current situation themselves. Epic refused.</p><p><br> Instead, the company has repeatedly submitted Fortnite updates that violate store rules. This is unfair to all other developers in the App Store and makes users suffer from conflict.</p><p><br> We hope to be able to cooperate again in the future, but at the moment this is unfortunately not possible.</p><p><br> from Apple statement</p></blockquote>



<p>The corporation has warned that it is going to delete Epic Games accounts back on August 17th. Apparently, another account of the company, Epic International, is still available in the App Store – it was previously banned from blocking in court. Therefore, the situation should not touch upon the support of the Unreal Engine.</p>



<p>On the day Epic’s profiles were deleted, the App Store began to actively promote Fortnite’s direct competitor, PUBG Mobile. The online shooter appeared on the main page of the “Games” section, and the promo was published on the store’s official twitter.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The tweet was also noticed by the head of Epic Games, Tim Sweeney.</p>

<p>While you wait for Fortnite to return to iOS and Mac, here’s another great Battle Royale powered by the Unreal Engine!</p>

August 28, 2020 | https://www.umsu.de/wo/2018/688 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.umsu.de/wo/2018/688">archive.org</a>

   <p>I recently refereed Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares's <a href="https://intelligence.org/2017/10/22/fdt/">"Functional Decision
Theory"</a> for a philosophy journal. My recommendation was to accept
resubmission with major revisions, but since the article had already
undergone a previous round of revisions and still had serious
problems, the editors (understandably) decided to reject it. I normally don't publish
my referee reports, but this time I'll make an exception because the
authors are well-known figures from outside academia, and I want to
explain why their account has a hard time gaining traction in academic
philosophy. I also want to explain why I think their account is wrong,
which is a separate point.</p>

<p>I actually don't know Nate Soares, but Eliezer Yudkowsky is a
celebrity in the "rationalist" community. Many of his posts on the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality">Less Wrong blog</a> are
gems. I also enjoyed his latest book, <a href="https://equilibriabook.com/"><i>Inadequate Equilibria</i></a>.
Yudkowsky seems to be interested in almost everything, but he regards
decision theory as his main area of research. I also work in decision
theory, but I've always struggled with Yudkowsky's writings on this
topic.</p>

<p>Before I explain what I found wrong with the paper, let me review the
main idea and motivation behind the theory it defends.</p>

<p>Standard lore in decision theory is that there are situations in
which it would be better to be irrational. Three examples.</p>

<blockquote> <b>Blackmail.</b> Donald has committed an indiscretion.
Stormy has found out and considers blackmailing Donald. If Donald
refuses and blows Stormy's gaff, she is revealed as a blackmailer and
his indiscretion becomes public; both suffer. It is better for Donald
to pay hush money to Stormy. Knowing this, it is in Stormy's interest
to blackmail Donald. If Donald were irrational, he would blow Stormy's
gaff even though that would hurt him more than paying the hush money;
knowing this, Stormy would not blackmail Donald. So Donald would be
better off if here were (known to be) irrational.</blockquote>

<blockquote> <b>Prisoner's Dilemma with a Twin.</b> Twinky and her
clone have been arrested. If they both confess, each gets a 5 years
prison sentence. If both remain silent, they can't be convicted and
only get a 1 year sentence for obstructing justice. If one confesses
and the other remains silent, the one who confesses is set free and
the other gets a 10 year sentence. Neither cares about what happens to
the other. Here, confessing is the dominant act and the unique Nash
equilibrium. So if Twinky and her clone are rational, they'll each
spend 5 years in prison. If they were irrational and remained silent,
they would get away with 1 year.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Newcomb's Problem with Transparent Boxes.</b> A demon
invites people to an experiment. Participants are placed in front of
two transparent boxes. The box on the left contains a thousand
dollars. The box on the right contains either a million or nothing.
The participants can choose between taking both boxes (two-boxing) and
taking just the box on the right (one-boxing). If the demon has
predicted that a participant one-boxes, she put a million dollars into
the box on the right. If she has predicted that a participant
two-boxes, she put nothing into the box. The demon is very good at
predicting, and the participants know this. Each participant is only
interested in getting as much money as possible. Here, the rational
choice is to take both boxes, because you are then guaranteed to get
$1000 more than if you one-box. But almost all of those who
irrationally take just one box end up with a million dollars, while
most of those who rationally take both boxes leave with
$1000.</blockquote>

<p>The driving intuition behind Yudkowsky and Soares's paper is that
decision theorists have been wrong about these (and other) cases: in
each case, the supposedly irrational choice is actually rational.
Whether a pattern of behaviour is rational, they argue, should be
measured by how good it is for the agent. In <i>Newcomb's Problem with
Transparent Boxes</i>, one-boxers fare better than two-boxers. So we
should regard one-boxing as rational. Similarly for the other
examples. Standard decision theories therefore get these cases wrong.
We need a new theory.</p>

<p>Functional Decision Theory (FDT) is meant to be that theory. FDT
recommends blowing the gaff in <i>Blackmail</i>, remaining silent in
<i>Prisoner's Dilemma with a Twin</i>, and one-boxing in <i>Newcomb's
Problem with Transparent Boxes</i>.</p>

<p>Here's how FDT works, and how it differs from the most popular form
of decision theory, Causal Decision Theory (CDT). Suppose an agent
faces a choice between two options A and B. According CDT, the agent
should evaluate these options in terms of their possible consequences
(broadly understood). That is, the agent should consider what might
happen if she were to choose A or B, and weigh the possible outcomes
by their probability. In FDT, the agent should not consider what would
happen if she were to choose A or B. Instead, she ought to consider
what would happen if <i>the right choice according to FDT were A or
B</i>.</p>

<p>Take <i>Newcomb's Problem with Transparent Boxes</i>. Without loss
of generality, suppose you see $1000 in the left box and a million in
the right box. If you were to take both boxes, you would get a million
and a thousand. If you were to take just the right box, you would get
a million. So Causal Decision Theory says you should take box boxes.
But let's suppose you follow FDT, and you are certain that you do. You
should then consider what would be the case if FDT recommended
one-boxing or two-boxing. These hypotheses are not hypotheses just
about your present choice. If FDT recommended two-boxing, then any FDT
agent throughout history would two-box. And, crucially, the demon
would (probably) have foreseen that you would two-box, so she would
have put nothing into the box on the right. As a result, if FDT
recommended two-boxing, you would probably end up with $1000. To be
sure, you know that there's a million in the box on the right. You can
see it. But according to FDT, this is irrelevant. What matters is what
<i>would</i> be in the box relative to different assumptions about
what FDT recommends.</p>

<p>To spell out the details, one would now need to specify how to
compute the probability of various outcomes under the subjunctive
supposition that FDT recommended a certain action. Yudkowsky and
Soares are explicit that the supposition is to be understood as
counterpossible: we need to suppose that a certain mathematical
function, which in fact outputs A for input X, instead were to output
B. They do not explain how to compute the probability of outcomes
under such a counterpossible supposition. So we don't get any details
spelled out. This is flagged as the main open question for FDT.</p>

<p>It is not obvious to me why Yudkowsky and Soares choose to model
the relevant supposition as a mathematical falsehood. For example, why
not let the supposition be: <i>I am the kind of agent who chooses A in
the present decision problem</i>? That is an ordinary contingent
(centred) propositions, since there are possible agents who do choose
option A in the relevant problem. These agents may not
follow FDT, but I don't see why that would matter. For some reason, Yudkowsky and
Soares assume that an FDT agent is certain that she follows FDT, and
this knowledge is held fixed under all counterfactual suppositions. I
guess there is a reason for this assumption, but they don't tell
us.</p>

<p>Anyway. That's the theory. What's not to like about it?</p>

<p>For a start, I'd say the theory gives insane recommendations in
cases like <i>Blackmail</i>, <i>Prisoner's Dilemma with a Twin</i>,
and <i>Newcomb's Problem with Transparent Boxes</i>. Take
<i>Blackmail</i>. Suppose you have committed an indiscretion that
would ruin you if it should become public. You can escape the ruin by
paying $1 once to a blackmailer. Of course you should pay! FDT says
you should not pay because, if you were the kind of person who doesn't
pay, you likely wouldn't have been blackmailed. How is that even
relevant? You <i>are</i> being blackmailed. Not being blackmailed
isn't on the table. It's not something you can choose.</p>

<p>Admittedly, that's not much of an objection. I say you'd be insane
not to pay the $1, Yudkowsky and Soares say you'd be irrational to
pay. Neither of us can prove that their judgement is right from
neutral premises.</p>

<p>What about the fact that FDT agents do better than (say) CDT
agents? I admit that if this were a fact, it would be somewhat
interesting. But it's not clear if it is true.</p>

<p>First, it depends on how success is measured. If you face the
choice between submitting to blackmail and refusing to submit (in the
kind of case we've discussed), you fare dramatically better if you
follow CDT than if you follow FDT. If you are in <i>Newcomb's Problem
with Transparent Boxes</i> and see a million in the right-hand box,
you again fare better if you follow CDT. Likewise if you see nothing
in the right-hand box.</p>

<p>So there's an obvious sense in which CDT agents fare better than
FDT agents in the cases we've considered. But there's also a sense in
which FDT agents fare better. Here we don't just compare the utilities
scored in particular decision problems, but also the fact that FDT
agents might face other kinds of decision problems than CDT agents.
For example, FDT agents who are known as FDT agents have a lower
chance of getting blackmailed and thus of facing a choice between
submitting and not submitting. I agree that it makes sense to take
these effects into account, at least as long as they are consequences
of the agent's own decision-making dispositions. In effect, we would
then ask what decision rule should be chosen by an engineer who wants
to build an agent scoring the most utility across its lifetime. Even
then, however, there is no guarantee that FDT would come out better.
What if someone is set to punish agents who use FDT, giving them
choices between bad and worse options, while CDTers are given great
options? In such an environment, the engineer would be wise not build
an FDT agent.</p>

<p>Moreover, FDT does not in fact consider only consequences of the
agent's own …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>By Leib Litman, PhD, Zohn Rosen, PhD, Cheskie Rosenzweig, MS, Aaron Moss, PhD, Adam Dietrich, &amp; Jonathan Robinson, PhD</strong></p><h2><strong>Background</strong></h2><p>Lately, there’s been considerable debate over the accuracy of presidential polls. While recent polls show Joe Biden ahead,&nbsp;a number of pundits speculate that some Donald Trump supporters may be hesitant to share their true opinions when polled by phone. That hypothesis is gaining traction, leading some to argue that Trump may be leading despite what the latest numbers show. It’s also being fueled by the belief that 2020 will be a repeat of the 2016 election, when Trump polled poorly in advance of the election, but still went on to win the Electoral College vote.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the current debate on whether there are segments of Trump (or Biden) backers reticent to express their true opinions in phone polls, there’s been little empirical investigation into if the phenomenon actually exists. Pundits on major broadcast and cable news networks, such as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/does-a-shy-trump-voter-exist-arnon-mishkin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fox News</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/09/politics/trump-voters-analysis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a>, continue to speculate on the potential impact of so-called “shy Trump voters” on the outcome of the November presidential election result.&nbsp; In a recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/us/politics/trump-polls.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> published in <em>The New York Times</em>, David Winston says the following:&nbsp;</p><p><em>“The idea that people lie, it’s an interesting theory, and it’s not like it’s completely off-the-wall. But it’s obviously a very complicated thing to try to prove because what do you do? Ask them, ‘Are you lying?’”</em></p><p>On its face, a poll that asks people whether they lie in phone polls may not make much&nbsp;sense. After all, why would a person who lies in a telephone poll tell the truth about that in a different online poll? We here at CloudResearch reasoned that the issue may be methodological.</p><p>To explore this issue, we structured our survey to overcome shortcomings of previous polls. Instead of simply asking voters whom they will vote for — and then ask whether they just lied — we centered our research around a general question: “Are you comfortable in truthfully disclosing the presidential candidate you intend to vote for in a telephone poll?” Our rationale for this approach was that there’s a major difference between admitting you just lied and admitting to being genuinely concerned about disclosing your preferred candidate.&nbsp;</p><p>For the most part, we expected to find very few “shy voters.” After all, telephone surveys are supposed to be anonymous, so why would people be reluctant to share their opinions? However, to the extent people said that they were reluctant to express their voting preferences on a telephone poll, we were interested in their rationale for their reluctance. As a result, we included open-ended follow-up questions to better understand the factors that drive voters to fudge their responses.</p><hr><h2><strong>What CloudResearch Found</strong></h2><ul><li>11.7% of Republicans say they would not report their true opinions about their preferred presidential candidate on telephone polls.&nbsp;</li><li>In contrast, just 5.4% of Democrats say they’d be reluctant to share their true voting intentions — roughly half the number of Republicans reluctant to tell the truth on phone polls.&nbsp;</li><li>10.5% of Independents fell into the “shy voter” category, just a percentage point lower than how Republicans react to phone polls.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>After asking about people expressing their true opinions on telephone calls, we then inquired about their preferred candidate. This ordering was important as we did not want to fall into the same trap as other pollsters who tend to lead with preference declarations. When we broke the responses down based on current Trump vs Biden supporters, we found the following:</p><ul><li>10.1% of Trump supporters said they were likely to be untruthful on phone surveys — double the number of Biden supporters (5.1%) reticent to share their true intentions.</li></ul><p>When respondents indicated that they were untruthful during polls, we followed up to confirm those responses, and then inquired as to why “shy voters” are concerned about sharing their voting intentions. Some example responses are below. These are just a representational sampling of viewpoints that we collected — sentiments not easy to gauge by responses to mere yes/no questions.&nbsp;</p><p><em>“I don’t believe the information would be confidential and I think it’s dangerous to express an opinion outside of the current liberal viewpoint.”</em></p><p><em>“Well I probably wouldn’t give my opinion period, but if pushed, I would not give my real opinion for fear of reprisal if someone found out.”</em></p><p><em>“Because most polls released to the public are slanted and aren’t scientifically based.

Data were collected August 19 – 27, 2020. The two waves differed from each other in terms of how quotas were set. In the first sample, the full sample was matched to the U.S. Census and the sample was equally split between Republicans, Democrats and Independents. In the second wave, rather than matching the entire sample to the U.S. Census, each political party was matched to the demographic quotas appropriate for that party. The results presented above are for the first wave of participants, although the overall findings were similar across both waves. Specifically, in Wave 2, 10.5% of Trump supporters said they were likely to be untruthful on phone surveys compared to 4.6% of Biden supporters.</p><h3><strong>Survey Design&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Prior to entering the survey, all respondents were screened for attentiveness and English language comprehension. Following the screening process a <em>responsive verification protocol</em> was used, consisting of multiple interactive interview steps. Step 1 – Respondents were first asked one of two randomly assigned questions: Q1 – “Given today’s charged political environment, if you were asked in an automated telephone poll (also called “Interactive Voice Response” or “IVR”), would you give your true opinion about which presidential candidate you are likely to vote for?”. Q2 – “Given today’s charged political environment, if you were asked by a telephone interviewer, would you give your true opinion about which presidential candidate you are likely to vote for?”. We also wanted to compare how comfortable respondents are in responding to telephone polls, compared to online and in-person polls. We therefore also asked the same question about phone interviews, online surveys, and in-person polls, presented next to each other in the same grid. The response options to all questions were: 1. “I would definitely express my true opinion”, 2. “I would probably express my true opinion”, 3. “I would probably not express my true opinion” and 4. “I would definitely not express my true opinion”.</p><p>Step 2 – For those who indicated that they would not provide their true opinion on either question from Step 1 (i.e. responded with options 3 or 4), a follow-up question was asked: “On a previous question, you indicated that you may not express your true opinion over the phone about which presidential candidate you support. Sometimes people click on a button by accident, so we just wanted to verify your response. Are you …</p></div></div>

<p>Yep, thatâ€™s Rust code with embedded Objective-C syntax, and it works. Why would you do such a thing? Maybe you want tighter interop between the Rust and Objective-C parts of your iOS app. Maybe you want to write your iOS app <em>entirely</em> in Rust. Or maybe you just wanted to see if it was possible after your <a href="https://twitter.com/porglezomp">colleague</a>â€™s offhand remark.</p>

<p>(For me, it was the last one, absolutely.)</p>

<p>This post is going to walk through what it took to make this possible, so hereâ€™s a table of contents:</p>

<p>Sections 3-5 might actually be useful to other people looking to write Rust macros, so even though this project is a toy, you may still get something out of reading the post. However, if youâ€™re looking to use Objective-C from Rust in production, you should not be using my unsafe toy here. Instead, use Steven Sheldonâ€™s <a href="https://crates.io/crates/objc"><code>objc</code> crate</a>. Sheldon also has a blog post from near the start of the project that talks about <a href="https://sasheldon.com/blog/2014/11/28/interoperating-between-objective-c-and-rust/">his design process beyond the bare message-send implementation</a>.</p>

<p>That said, if you want to see the full source of my little monstrosity, you can <a href="https://belkadan.com/source/rust-inline-objc/">check out the repository</a>.</p>

<h2 id="background-on-objective-c">Background on Objective-C</h2>

<p>My normal audience these days is probably Swift developers, but I expect this one to make rounds with at least some Rust people as well. Itâ€™d be easy for both groups to not have much direct experience with Objective-C, the primary language used by Apple for both macOS<sup id="fnref:osx" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:osx">1</a></sup> and iOS since their releases in 2001 and 2007. So, hereâ€™s the quick summary: itâ€™s â€œjustâ€� C, except when you start working with â€œobjectâ€� types. And nearly everything you do with those objects is based on a dynamic dispatch model implemented in the <em>runtime.</em> Because of the two parts of that sentence (â€œdynamic dispatchâ€� and â€œimplemented in the runtimeâ€�), people have come up with a lot of clever and powerful techniques to make programs simpler, more expressive, or more extensible, though sometimes at the cost of security, secrecy, and stability.</p>

<p>More relevant to us, however, is that a language whose features are (nearly) all available in a runtime library is a language thatâ€™s easy to bridge to dynamically, as long as you donâ€™t have really tight performance constraints. So hereâ€™s the deal: nearly everything you do in Objective-C is calling methods by <em>sending messages,</em> and the way this works is that methods are regular C functions stored in a dispatch table keyed by a uniqued string called a <dfn>selector</dfn>. It is likely that the most heavily-optimized piece of code in Appleâ€™s libraries is <code>objc_msgSend</code>, which takes a <dfn>receiver</dfn>, a selector, and the arguments to the method, does a (cached) lookup of the selector in the receiverâ€™s classâ€™s dispatch table(s), and then jumps directly to the appropriate, polymorphically-selected implementation of the method.</p>

<p>There are more things the Objective-C runtime exposes, but messages are absolutely the most important.</p>

<p>â€¦Oh, one more thing. Because Objective-C is an extension to C, it has to use syntax that doesnâ€™t conflict with C syntax. That means keywords with <code>@</code> signs in front of themâ€”one of the few symbols on the US keyboard that doesnâ€™t already have a meaning in Câ€”and a unique bracket-based â€œmessage sendâ€� syntax that takes a while to get used to:</p>

<pre><code>// Objective-C
NSString *fileStr = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:fileContents encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

// Pseudo-Swift
let fileStr: NSString = NSString.alloc().initWithData(fileContents, encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding)

// Actual Swift
let fileStr = NSString(data: fileContents, encoding: .utf8)

// Pseudo-Rust
let fileStr: *const NSString = NSString::alloc().initWithData(fileContents, NSUTF8StringEncoding)

// Idiomatic-ish Rust
let file_str = NSString::from_data(file_contents, NSStringEncoding::UTF8)
</code></pre>

<p>People almost universally think Objective-C syntax is ugly when they first see it, almost universally find it completely normal after a few years, and largely (though <em>not</em> almost universally) find idiomatic Swift easier to read even if theyâ€™re used to Objective-C.</p>

<h2 id="objective-c-from-rust-manually">Objective-C from Rust, manually</h2>

<p>From this point on youâ€™ll be expected to read Rust syntax without step-by-step explanations. Iâ€™ll try to explain whatâ€™s going on for my Swift and other non-Rust readersâ€”I myself am still a relative newcomer to Rustâ€”but itâ€™ll be pretty fast. This is <em>not</em> intended to be an introduction to Rust or Rust macros!</p>

<p>Given that the Objective-C runtime exposes a public API, we should be able to pretty much just call that from Rust, and indeed we can:</p>

<p>Now, this code should make most Rust users pretty horrified. It starts out okay, declaring some types and then declaring the Rust versions of the C API from libobjc. Then itâ€™s got a funny empty extern block to link the Foundation framework, but sure, thatâ€™s fine. And itâ€™s got explicitly-null-terminated strings because thatâ€™s what C-based APIs generally use. (Rust doesnâ€™t guarantee null termination by default, which makes slicing a Rust string easier.)</p>

<p>But then thereâ€™s a monstrosity of a line involving <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.transmute.html"><code>std::mem::transmute</code></a>, Rustâ€™s equivalent of Swiftâ€™s <code>unsafeBitCast(_:)</code> or C++â€™s <code>reinterpret_cast</code> (and now <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/bit_cast"><code>bit_cast</code></a>) or Câ€™sâ€¦well, okay, C doesnâ€™t have a direct equivalent, but a plain old cast when youâ€™re talking about function pointers like this. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.transmute.html">docs for <code>transmute</code></a> even tell you to go use other things if possible.</p>

<p>So, what are we doing? Well, remember what I said about Objective-C and <code>objc_msgSend</code>: methods are regular C functions, and <code>objc_msgSend</code> â€œjumps directly to the appropriate, polymorphically-selected implementation of the methodâ€�. That means that the correct way to call <code>objc_msgSend</code> is to <em>pretend it has the right type for the method youâ€™re calling.</em></p>

<p>In C (and Swift, for that matter), that conversion would require explicitly specifying the type of all arguments and return values. But Rust has really powerful type inference within a function body, and that extends to specifying only <em>some</em> generic parameters, and leaving others out.<sup id="fnref:swift-inference" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:swift-inference">2</a></sup> In this case I need to specify that weâ€™re casting to a C function pointer with two arguments and a non-void return, but not anything more than that. The remaining information will be filled in based on how the function pointer is used.</p>

<p>With that, you should understand the (cursed) code above. Go ahead. Try it on your own machine (if your machine is a Mac).</p>

<h2 id="recursive-rust-macros">Recursive Rust macros</h2>

<p>Rust has a pretty robust macro system, so it wouldnâ€™t be impossible or even too hard to make a macro for â€œmessage sendâ€�. Thatâ€™s the route that the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/objc"><code>objc</code> crate</a> takes:</p>

<div><pre><code><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>url_class</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>NSURL</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>description_obj</span>: <span>*</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>Object</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>msg_send</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>url_class</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>description</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>utf8_ptr</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>msg_send</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>description_obj</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>UTF8String</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>CStr</span>::<span>from_ptr</span><span>(</span><span>utf8_ptr</span><span>).</span><span>to_string_lossy</span><span>());</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But while thatâ€™s clearly the right choice for serious Rust work, I wanted something more ambitious. More integrated. Moreâ€¦ridiculous.</p>

<blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">wait a minute. this is just objective-c <a href="https://t.co/dVQMYKKVTI">pic.twitter.com/dVQMYKKVTI</a></p>— Harlan Haskins (@harlanhaskins) <a href="https://twitter.com/harlanhaskins/status/1133210047952015360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2019</a></blockquote>


<p>What I wanted was for Objective-Câ€™s messaging syntax, or something like it, to be valid anywhere in Rust code. It didnâ€™t have to be exactly Objective-C, but I quickly realized the <em>advantage</em> of Objective-Câ€™s syntax: itâ€™s delimited, i.e. itâ€™s a self-contained expression that can be dropped into something larger without changing how that larger thing parses. (Thatâ€™s probably why itâ€™s bracketed in C as well.) Within the brackets, thereâ€™s basically two forms:</p>

<pre><code>[receiver-expr no-arg-selector]
[receiver-expr selector-piece:arg-expr selector-piece:second-arg-expr...]
</code></pre>

<p>If I were <em>just</em> matching that, I could use Rustâ€™s original <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html#declarative-macros-with-macro_rules-for-general-metaprogramming">pattern-matching macros</a>. But to take a whole block of code, and replace everything that looks like a message lock <em>in</em> that blockâ€¦well, it might be possible with pattern-matching and quite a bit of recursion, but itâ€™s going to be a lot easier to use <em><a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/21/Procedural-Macros-in-Rust-2018.html">procedural macros</a>,</em> a Rust macro interface written in Rust and used as a compiler plugin. (Swift folks, basically what <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax">SwiftSyntax</a> allows you to do, but invoked on-demand during compilation.)</p>

<p><a href="https://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a> has been JavaScript’s unofficial standard functional programming library for a decade (together with its major fork, <a href="https://lodash.com/">Lodash</a>). Its most recent significant development is the move to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules">ECMAScript 6 modules</a> (ESM). Underscore 1.11 is the first version to be fully modular.</p>
<p>With the new modularity, you can now create a custom build of Underscore with an even smaller footprint. At the same time, we still provide the standard UMD build, which is perfect if you want to get started quickly. The UMD bundle is easy to work with and it has great cache retention if you load it from a CDN.</p>
<p>Underscore was originally created by <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas">Jeremy Ashkenas</a> and he is still helping with the releases. Besides Underscore, he created several other awesome JavaScript libraries and tools, notably <a href="https://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> and <a href="https://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>. If you haven’t heard about them yet, you should check them out.</p>
<p><a href="https://juliangonggrijp.com/">I</a> am not Jeremy Ashkenas, but I modularized Underscore. In this article, I will discuss the ins and outs of modular Underscore, and I will try to answer all questions you may have. The article is written Q&amp;A style, so you can read it once, then come back later and use it as a reference.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-_">What is _?</h3>
<p>Besides a bunch of essential functions, Underscore exports an object named <code>_</code>, which is central to its functionality. Hence the name “Underscore”. <code>_</code> is all of the following at the same time:</p>
<ul>
<li>A namespace handle through which you can access the <code>VERSION</code> string as well as all the functions: <code>_.each</code>, <code>_.VERSION</code>.</li>
<li>The entry point for customizing the behavior of Underscore functions, currently through <a href="https://underscorejs.org/#iteratee"><code>_.iteratee</code></a> and <a href="https://underscorejs.org/#template"><code>_.templateSettings</code></a>.</li>
<li>The default placeholder for <a href="https://underscorejs.org/#partial"><code>_.partial</code></a>.</li>
<li>A special value wrapping function that enables <a href="https://underscorejs.org/#oop">OO style</a> and <a href="https://underscorejs.org/#chaining">chaining</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The role of namespace handle is probably the most well known. Before the advent of ES6 modules, having such a namespace handle was a necessity. There are many other libraries from this era that exploit the namespace handle to be a useful function as well. jQuery’s <code>$</code> is a famous example of this. While there is no longer a strong incentive to have a multi-purpose namespace handle, it continues to be useful, so we keep it around in Underscore. In ES6 module context, it is still the <code>default</code> export.</p>
<p>Arguably, the role of special value wrapping function is much more interesting. Thanks to this function, you can do <code>_.map(x, f)</code>, <code>_(x).map(f)</code> or <code>_.chain(x).map(f).value()</code>. These expressions are equivalent, and they share a single underlying implementation of the <code>map</code> function. The same applies to all other Underscore functions. This is made possible by having a standalone definition of each function, and then adding all functions to <code>_</code> with a single call to <a href="https://underscorejs.org/#mixin"><code>_.mixin</code></a>. It is a very elegant design; please take a peek at (the bottom of) the <a href="https://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore-esm.html">annotated source</a> if you’d like to admire the details.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-monolithic-interface">What is the monolithic interface?</h3>
<p>The <code>_</code> object with its magical bells and whistles is made out of all the parts of the Underscore library. As such, <code>_</code> represents the whole library at once; this is what I mean by the monolithic interface. Historically, this used to be the <em>only</em> interface to the library.</p>
<p>Any module that provides <code>_</code> depends on all of Underscore. If your project imports something from such a module, even if you do not import <code>_</code> itself, then your project effectively imports all of Underscore. I refer to this as “using the monolithic interface” in a wide sense.</p>
<p>Don’t worry though! With modular Underscore, you can have all the tricks that <code>_</code> provides, such as chaining, and still be selective about which parts you want to import. Basically, you can create your own variant of the monolithic interface. I’ll cover the details below.</p>
<p>I should add that Underscore is both lightweight and widely adopted. Using the standard monolithic interface is a wise choice in many cases. More on this below as well.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-modular-interface">What is the modular interface?</h3>
<p>As of version 1.11, every individual part of Underscore can be imported from a separate module. Selectively importing these parts directly, instead of relying on a module that gives you the monolithic interface, amounts to using the modular interface.</p>
<p>There is a separate module for each Underscore function. Some of these functions, notably <code>mixin</code> and <code>chain</code>, can be used to create your own customized monolithic interface.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the modular interface brings powerful flexibility but also responsibility. The standard monolithic interface is well designed and coherent. If you choose to omit parts of it, you might end up with something that doesn’t do what you want.</p>
<p>I will detail the options and the pitfalls below.</p>
<h3 id="why-tiny-modules">Why tiny modules?</h3>
<p>In general, spreading the source code of a project over multiple modules promotes code reuse. If I can pick the code that I am interested in from your library, without having to import code that I am not interested in, then I am more likely to use the code that you already wrote, instead of reinventing the wheel. Everyone saves time and we get our flying cars sooner.</p>
<p>When I <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore/pull/2849">modularized Underscore</a>, I went for the most extreme option: I put every function in a separate module. I did this in order to maximize the potential for code reuse. I want users to be able to select <em>exactly</em> the code that they need; no more, no less. I am already working on a library that will exploit this myself.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-treeshaking">What about treeshaking?</h3>
<p>In theory, I would not need to go all the way down to individual function modules in order to get perfect selectivity. Tools like <a href="https://rollupjs.org/">Rollup</a> can isolate individual functions from a larger module, a “trick” known as treeshaking. In practice, however, static analysis of JavaScript is hard. With everything being mutable and unsafely typed, it can be hard to tell whether one piece of code might influence another, especially without human intelligence, and the tools are far from perfect as a result.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore/pull/2826">early stage</a> of my modularization effort, all of the exported functions were still pooled together in a single ES module. At this stage, I tested treeshaking with <code>_.map</code>. It sort of worked, in the sense that the result was only about half as large as the whole Underscore library. When I further split this module down to the individual functions, however, <code>_.map</code> shrank by another factor of 3. It turns out that <code>_.map</code>, and the other Underscore functions that it depends on, together make up only one sixth of the library.</p>
<p>\( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \), so there is a whole third of the Underscore code that Rollup is not able to treeshake. The only way to avoid needlessly importing that code is to manually isolate it in a separate module, which is exactly what I did.</p>
<h3 id="what-build-variants-can-i-choose-from">What build variants can I choose from?</h3>
<p>The source code consists of ESM modules. These modules live in the <code>modules/</code> package subdirectory and you can use them directly. From the source, we build several variants in order to cater to a wide range of use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>underscore.js</code> (in the package root), the monolithic UMD bundle. This file has the same path and the same format as older versions of Underscore. It is also still the <code>main</code> entry of the package, and it is the variant that you are most likely to use in the short term.</li>
<li><code>underscore-esm.js</code>, the monolithic ESM bundle. While fully supported, this variant is likely to see mostly experimental usage in the short term.</li>
<li><code>amd/</code>, the modular AMD build. This directory contains an AMD version of each source module.</li>
<li><code>cjs/</code>, the modular CommonJS build, analogous to the modular AMD build.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Monolithic bundle” in the first two build variants means both that the variant provides the monolithic interface, and that it is entirely contained in a single file.</p>
<p>Naturally, only the modular variants support modular usage. All variants support monolithic usage, but for efficiency, it is best to use the monolithic bundles.</p>
<h3 id="why-have-monolithic-build-variants">Why have monolithic build variants?</h3>
<p>Modules are useful, but the monolithic bundles have some compelling advantages as well (besides backwards compatibility):</p>
<ul>
<li>The code is easier to read and it is easier to see the big picture. This is why we render the <a href="https://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore-esm.html">single-read annotated source</a> from the monolithic build. Although it can be fun and somewhat illuminating to discover the code by clicking through <a href="https://underscorejs.org/docs/modules/index-all.html">the annotated modules</a>.</li>
<li>Reading a single large file from a file system is substantially faster than reading many small files.</li>
<li>On the web, sending a single request with a large response is substantially more efficient than sending many requests with small responses.</li>
<li>Since Underscore is such a major library, cache retention is likely to be very good if you embed the standard monolithic bundle from a CDN, especially the UMD bundle. More on this in the next sections.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-a-cdn">What are the benefits of a CDN?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/using-a-cdn-to-speed-up-static-content-delivery">CDNs</a> are <em>awesome</em>, especially for open source libraries. In a nutshell, websites often use the same resources—such as Underscore—and by referencing those resources from a common URL, instead of hosting their own copies, they enjoy <em>collaborativ…</em></p></article></div>

	<p><img alt="SQUADS HAVE EXISTED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS" src="https://otherinter.net/squad-ancient.png"></p>
<p>Recent events&nbsp;have completely exposed the limits of individual agency, creating a powerful demand for squad-based forms of resiliency. The COVID-19 pandemic is the most recent of these social bonding agents: though we're <em>physically</em> distancing, <em>emotionally</em> we're getting closer. First priority when the virus dropped was securing your squad. The need for group coordination and decision-making soon followed.</p>
<p>But today's emerging culture of group cohesion is driven equally by the social and financial precarity of urban life. <em>Family are those we share space and rent with</em>. Priced out of tier-1 cities, individuals have banded together to survive a jobless market with no social safety net.</p>
<p>Squads are both a product of—and a response to—contemporary social atomization. The trope of "getting a place upstate" signifies young city-dwellers' desire for new kinds of squad-based homesteading. HOMESQUADING is a modern day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-to-the-land_movement">back-to-the-land movement</a>—swap Whole Earth-inspired post-war communes with post-internet surf clubs microblogging the virtues of cooperative housing, permaculture gardening, and solar-powered mesh networks.</p>
<p>Squad culture is the antithesis of neoliberal individualism. Millennials are healing from decades of irony poisoning, rediscovering what it's like to have generative, exploratory relationships with one another. Younger generations are already imbued with extremely powerful squad energy, equipped with formative experiences in Minecraft, DOTA 2, and Fortnite parties.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-ngram.png" alt="Military connotations aside, the arrival of group DMs ushers a new age of &quot;SQUAD&quot; discourse."></p>
<p>Military connotations aside, the arrival of group DMs ushers a new age of "SQUAD" discourse.</p>
<p>Whether bound together for survival or for lols, the squads formed by today's crisis will be resilient. Distance is no longer a barrier with the closeness of network space—soon vital culture will be predominantly enacted by fictive kin. Group collaboration is now the strong default, putting squads at the center of social, cultural, and economic life. To paraphrase Bill Bishop: today people are born as individuals, and have to find their squad.</p>

<p>While ancient squads were brought together by the struggle for survival, always-on group communication sets the scene for contemporary squad culture. Group chats and adapted team workspaces create shared context and institutional memory. One necessary condition of the squad is this sense of <em>persistence</em>: co-presence and continuous availability to one another.</p>
<p>But the squad is more than a loose network of affiliations, it's a coherent body. A second prerequisite of squad formation is self-recognition. It's not you or me. It's <em>Us</em>. <em>We.</em> <em>Ours</em>. This pillar often follows from the first. Squads may start as one-off Telegram channels, but they soon become "The Group Chat," a metonym for the squad itself.</p>
<p>For the squad to understand itself as a whole, it maintains boundaries circumscribing strong group norms. Fuck a Dunbar number—the ideal squad count is no more than 12. How can you really be <em>present</em> with more than a dozen people? Small groups are crucial for tight coordination. A greater network may surround the squad, making it appear big and fuzzy from the outside. But for the core crew, an invisible circle binds and protects a space of group identity.</p>
<p>As SQUAD VIBES grow, so does the possibility of interdependence and resource sharing—social, emotional, financial. Trust brought by consistent socialization and self-recognition is a foundation for exploring what the squad is capable of together. SQUAD CULTURE has only just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvJ7yW7Y3RY">begun</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-theory.png" alt="Theory of the squad"></p>

<p>The pandemic flipped the script on sharing space IRL, but our newly domestic reality only brought to the physical world what was already extremely online. Originally conceived as series of linked documents, Web 2.0 mass productization turned the internet into a series of linked interiors.</p>
<p>Today's squads are expressions of digital locality and the new squad era forces us to reconsider the individuated logic of early social networks. Contrary to early visions of hypertext, the internet is not a singular World Wide Web, traversed by individuals. To be online today is to enter the global arena. Mass social media are hazardous PvP zones no one should traverse without team support.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-network-groupings.png" alt="Network graph of twitter with people-based groupings"></p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-network.png" alt="Network graph of twitter"></p>
<p>The Twitter subcultures shown above are only a sliver of an expansive social deep web. Beneath this fuzzy graph is SQUAD SPACE, the network of inner-zones where digital microcultures are born: group DMs, Discords, Slacks, Keybases. Memes forged in SQUAD SPACE bubble out into the "clearnet" above, pwning NPCs on the <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/">internet of beefs</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-spaces.png" alt="Evolution of squad spaces"></p>
<p>Squad culture is downstream of squad space, and the digital places squads inhabit are only getting more advanced. The Discord can suddenly be on calls together. The Keybase can now use Git. <a href="https://subpixel.space/entries/come-for-the-network-pay-for-the-tool/">The team toolkit defines its capabilities</a>, and different platforms enable different modes of squad thought. Squad space is more than environment, it's a collective body, a shared cognition layer. Squad space is where market-moving trades are planned, conspiracies are conceived, and memes are spawned. Members of the squad may live in different geographies—but within this space, everyone is on SQUAD TIME. <a href="https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2020/07/07/the-garden-of-forking-memes/">The founding of a new group DM is year zero</a>.</p>
<p>Group dynamics ebb and flow with their environment, and nowhere more than SQUAD SPACE. Ecology calls this process “niche formation.” Online it's SQUAD CULTURE.</p>

<p>Inside the subterranean caves of the social deep web, chosen-kin groups grow their own culture. The squad doesn't need its own micro-currency—images, art, music, takes, shitposts, and, indeed, roasts are the native medium of exchange. Likewise squads have little use for internal financial incentives. Instead, playful exchanges produce trust, reciprocity, and VIBES—the ineffable group energy that squads value most. Accordingly, the core of squad production is the continuous production of the squad itself.</p>
<p>Evidenced by the power of crypto memetics, ragtag squads of shitposters have the power to define new forms of value based on their own esoteric social frameworks. Memeing produces "assets" that cannot be traditionally valued, but are capable of commanding cultural and economic movements.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-vibes.png" alt="Examples of squad vibes, including Twitch plays Pokemon, Chainlink $LINK Marines, Weird Sun Twitter, Brockhampton, Tik Tok Hype Houses, Theory of Vibe by Peli Grietzer, Bitcoin, and Headless Brands"></p>
<p>Memes, hot takes, internal language, 𝓪𝓮𝓼𝓽𝓱𝓮𝓽𝓲𝓬𝓼... artifacts that can only be formulated as a group are the mainstay of squad production. The group exudes potent SQUAD VIBES, and vibes attract. Outsiders want to share the vibe—sometimes for the social capital, sometimes because the content produced is of strategic value, and always because the energy is infectious. After enough fire in the group DM, some squads begin to externalize their social products. Podcasting is obviously a squad technology. Rapid publishing turns memes into whitepapers, quickly flooding the marketplace of ideas with locally-grown squad humor.</p>
<p>Whether formed by necessity or chance, once together the squad's potential for creative production is immeasurable. <a href="https://www.glass-bead.org/article/a-theory-of-vibe/?lang=enview">VIBE</a> is an unstable substance of high informtion density. In formalizing their vibes, squads may accidentally give birth to <a href="https://otherinter.net/web3/headless-brands/">headless brands</a>, virtual personalities, and pseudonymous entities they may not even be able to control. Thus the squad transitions from its youthful, entropic state, harnessing its vibes to create a source of unfathomable squad energy.</p>


<p>Group identity. Shared space. Vibes. These not only enable the creation of social capital, but strengthen the squad's capacity to organize, minimizing transaction costs and leading to greater productive capacities and resilience; this is "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm">the nature of the squad</a>." But while squads can be viewed as a "nexus of contracts", unlike the Coasean firm, they are without legal structure. Social contracts are instead effected through the unspoken bonds of <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/the-vibes-theory-of-organisational-design-937a73f791cd">mutual respect and ingroup norms</a>.</p>
<p>But to sustain this solidarity economy the squad may look for ways to translate vibes into monetizable modes of public engagement: clients, subscribers, sponsors, music deals, yields. SQUAD PRODUCTION begins with the creation of processes and interfaces to convert creative labor into units that can be transmitted by global network participants. Here SQUAD TOOLS come into play. Vibes generated at the DAW, on the Figma board, or in the gaming lobby are turned consumable cultural instruments. Then it's just a matter of distribution. Young artists create online galleries and independent labels because they allow groups to interact (and transact) with the world through familiar organizational patterns. Bandcamps, Twitch pages, DAOs are public APIs for squads to interact with entities beyond their trust boundary.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-trust-stream.png" alt="Example of a Twitch stream from Berlin-based Trust (squad)"></p>
<p>Some digital tools are public interfaces, while others are used to coordinate internally. Today this SQUAD INFRASTRUCTURE is comprised of simple software primitives: Venmo, Splitwise, Cash App. These apps are financial plumbing that facilitate internal coordination between squad members by minimizing the awkwardness of asking your friends for money. Despite the strong demand for SQUAD RESILIENCY, the social stigma of group finances is still a major barrier to economic exchange among friends.</p>
<p>In-app mechanics like budget trackers, polls, and coin-flips offer a half-way point between social agreements and technical solutions. For instance Splitwise relies heavily on the social norms to ensure expenses are entered accurately. By allowing individuals to opt-in to a set of rules for retroactive settlement the group's social friction and coordination costs are reduced. Civilization advances by extending the number of important functions squads can perform without thinking.</p>
<p>Some believe new software can liberate "individual creators." But this kind of thinking inevitably leads to Uberized platform-mediated wage labor. We want to liberate squads. <em>The <strong>group</strong> is the basic user class for the tools we need today as a society, yet few pieces of software allow the squad as a whole to produce cooperatively and generate wealth together</em>. To fully realize SQUAD CULTURE this must change.</p>

						<p>It’s easy to imagine that governments were always as bureaucratic as they are today. Certain policies, like the widespread granting of monopolies in the seventeenth century, or the presence of a powerful landed aristocracy, seem like archaic products of a past that was simply more corrupt. The fact that governments rarely got involved with healthcare or education before the mid-nineteenth century seems the product of a lack of imagination, or perhaps yet another product of our ancestors’ venality – simply what happens when you put the war-hungry knights and nobles in charge.</p>
<p>But the bureaucratic state of today, with its officials involving themselves with every aspect of modern life, is a relatively recent invention. In a world without bureaucracy, when state capacity was relatively lacking, it’s difficult to see what other options monarchs would have had. Suppose yourself transported to the throne of England in 1500, and crowned monarch. Once you bored of the novelty and luxuries of being head of state, you might become concerned about the lot of the common man and woman. Yet even if you wanted to create a healthcare system, or make education free and universal to all children, or even create a police force (London didn’t get one until 1829, and the rest of the country not til much later), there is absolutely no way you could succeed.</p>
<p>For a start, you would struggle to maintain your hold on power. Fund schools you say? Somebody will have to pay. The nobles? Well, try to tax them — in many European states they were exempt from taxation — and you might quickly lose both your throne and your head. And supposing you do manage to tax them, after miraculously stamping out an insurrection without their support, how would you even begin to go about collecting it? There was simply no central government agency capable of raising it. Working out how much people should pay, chasing up non-payers, and even the physical act of collection, not to mention protecting that treasure once collected, all takes substantial manpower. Not to mention the fact that the collecting agents will likely siphon most of it off to line their own pockets.</p>
<p>As a monarch in 1500, you would be forced to rely heavily on delegation. As the economic historian Jared Rubin emphasizes, every ruler requires agents to propagate their rule. These can take the form of big burly blokes with heavy weapons — your enforcers — and they can take the form of people spreading the ideology of your right to rule, lending your orders legitimacy and more generally spreading social norms of obedience — the local officials, jurists, and clerics. Crucially, these propagating agents needed to be kept on-side at all costs. Hence the tax exemptions for nobles, many of whom were rich enough to support their own private armies, and whose ancestors might have been granted such a privilege by one of your predecessors.</p>
<p>Joan of Arc’s village, for example, was exempted from taxation <i>forever,</i> because of her role in restoring the French king’s military fortunes. And hence the control often exerted over policy by religious figures, who could give one’s rule divine sanction in the eyes of the people. It is no surprise that the emperors of China carefully cultivated themselves at the head of as many religions as possible (one of the reasons that Christianity, with its rather awkward stress on Jesus being the king of kings, was occasionally banned from the empire). As economic historians Mark Koyama and Noel Johnson argue, this focus on appeasing religious legitimisers was one of the reasons rulers so often sought to stamp out heretics and heathens.</p>
<p>Even beyond satisfying the propagating agents, however, core state activities like tax collection were heavily reliant on delegation of authority. Absent an expensive bureaucracy to do it on your behalf, it was much easier to farm out the activity to others. When taxing a predominantly agrarian society — in 1500, only 3.6% of England’s population lived in cities — it made most sense to appoint a local noble to be tax farmer for an area. As a local, they would know the area well, and the products of the land are relatively straightforward to tax. It’s not exactly easy to hide. And as for the tax farmer, they could be remunerated by taking a cut of what they collected. Corrupt, yes. But inevitable and even seen as legitimate, given the lack of alternatives.</p>
<p>Your capacity as a ruler was thus entirely governed by the <em>quid pro quo</em>, and heavily restricted by the deals made by your predecessors. Cities were granted charters, giving them various rights of self-governance, in return for collecting taxes from among their own members (commerce and industry being much harder to tax than land, and thus requiring more consent). And, of course, there were occasionally times when the defence of the realm might require extra taxes — for such instances, rulers convened parliaments. Taxes raised by parliaments were referred to, somewhat confusingly, as “subsidies”. But that is exactly what they were: special subsidies granted to the monarch, by the collected representatives of the nobles and the various other propagating agents, for a one-off extraordinary purpose – albeit giving those collected agents some say over policy.</p>
<p>It was not until 1689, when there was a coup, that an incoming ruler allowed the English parliament to sit whenever it pleased. Before that, it was convened only at the whim of the ruler, and dispersed even at the slightest provocation. In 1621, for example, when James I was planning to marry his heir to a Spanish princess, Parliament sent him a petition asserting their right to debate the matter. Upon hearing of it, he called for the official record of parliamentary proceedings, personally ripped out the page with the offending vote, and promptly dissolved the Parliament. The downside, of course, was that James could not then acquire any parliamentary subsidies.</p>
<p>Ruling was thus an intensely personal affair, of making deals and finding ways to circumvent deals you had inherited. Increasing your capabilities as a ruler – state capacity – was thus no easy task, as the typical ruler was stuck in an essentially medieval equilibrium. Imposing a policy costs money, but raising money involves imposing policy. Breaking out of this chicken-and-egg problem took centuries of canny leadership. The rulers who achieved it most would today seem hopelessly corrupt.</p>
<p>To gain extra cash without interference from Parliament, successive monarchs first asserted and then abused their ancient prerogative rights to grant monopolies over trades and industries. They eventually granted them to whomever was willing to pay, establishing monopolies over industries like gambling cards or alehouses under the guise of regulating unsavoury activities. They also sold off knighthoods and titles, and in 1670 Charles II even made a secret deal with the French that he would convert to Catholicism and attack the Protestant Dutch, all in exchange for cash. Anything to not have to call a potentially pesky Parliament. At times, the most effective rulers even resembled mob bosses. Take Elizabeth I’s anger when a cloth-laden merchant fleet bound for an Antwerp fair in 1559 was allowed to depart. Her order to stop them had not arrived in time, thus preventing her from extracting “loans” from the merchants while she still had their goods within her power.</p>
<p>Yet, ironically, it was when monarchs lost control that they did most to boost the capabilities of the centralised state. It was under Parliament, first in the 1650s when it briefly overthrew the monarchy, and then from the late 1680s following its deal with the usurping William III, that British state capacity began to most rapidly and inexorably grow. Likewise, in France, it was following the French Revolution that the steady rise of state capacity was boosted — it was then, over three centuries after the fact, that the perpetual tax exemptions for Joan of Arc’s village were finally rescinded.</p>
<p>Parliaments, as bodies of legitimising agents, despite their lack of representation in any modern democratic sense, had the unquestioned legitimacy with which to raise taxes, change policy, and undo the deals of previous monarchs. In the process, they often trampled on the ancient liberties of citizens and subjects. But, unlike monarchs, they found it much easier to force the changes through. When motivated by the needs of war — often the one thing members could agree on — parliaments in the eighteenth century were able to raise cash that would have been unfathomable to the monarchs of even a few decades before. And it was parliaments, also, that were eventually susceptible in the nineteenth century to the lobbying of those who wished the state to involve itself in areas like education, health, and policing.</p>
<p>The route to state capacity thus took centuries of blood, dirty dealing, corruption and campaigning to make the states we have to today. But it is difficult to see how it could have been done in any other way.</p>

    <p>It takes roughly 2 weeks to form a habit; it takes roughly two weeks to get comfortable in a new environment. A common mistake is to treat a new report’s first couple weeks like college orientation - social, light hearted, get-to-know-you stuff. If your report spends the first two weeks reading C# documentation and having lunch out on the town with the team, guess what, they’ve just normalized that behavior as what the role is.</p>

<p>The answer: start your report doing real work as soon as possible. If they’re a software engineer, they should be committing code week one (ideally day 2 or 3); If they’re a product manager, they should be attending meetings and picking up supporting activities on a similar time frame. Then the tone has been set - working here means getting things done.</p>

<p>This means as manager you need to give your report tractable work in the first week. Managers not being ready for a report to start is the number one reason people end up normalizing underperformance, because they had nothing meaningful to do. If a manager describes a report as not having initiative in the first couple weeks it’s a red flag - it’s the manager’s job to provide new hires with clear paths to contribute immediately.</p>

<p>Another main reason people fall into onboarding traps is because your organization has painfully slow onboarding. Endless HR videos, slow security processes, a mountain of fragile technology setup - these all make for a shitty and counterproductive start at a company. Optimize your onboarding to get people doing what you hired them to do. Look to formalize performance indicators of your onboarding. For example, for engineers this could be time-to-first-commit and time-to-joining-sprints.</p>

<p>This approach holds for managers and executives as well. In that cohort it’s also common and a common red flag for people to spend the first couple weeks putzing around under the guise of “getting to know what’s going on”. Managers and executives should be involved in the decisions of the team from day 1 and developing artifacts - plans, TODO lists, strategy documents - in the first couple weeks. With good managers and executives you see them day 1 adding perspective and insight into conversations, and everyone collectively appreciates that the right person has been hired.</p>

<p>Onboarding is one of the most critical periods in a person’s time at a company. It’s one of the highest ROI periods when managing someone. Take that opportunity to set expectations properly and measure success quantiatively.</p>

<p>From Germany come leaks around the performance of the&nbsp;<strong>AMD EPYC MILAN</strong>&nbsp;CPUs, which are expected to be the first CPUs with the&nbsp;<strong>Zen3</strong>&nbsp;microarchitecture&nbsp;to hit the market.&nbsp;As indicated, the&nbsp;<strong>7nm</strong>&nbsp;manufacturing process, the same maximum number of cores (64), the use of DDR4 memory, and the PCI-Express 4.0 interface are maintained.</p>
<p>The novelties are changes in the structure of the Core Compute Die (CCD) and, therefore, of the Core Compute Complex (CCX).&nbsp;Each of the current CCDs consists of two CCX clusters in which the L3 cache is divided into two 16MB caches.&nbsp;With MILAN&nbsp;<strong>this cache will not be divided</strong>, so it comes in the form of a single 32 MB cache.&nbsp;AMD itself had mentioned integrating more than 32 MB in October, so it apparently has not reached more than 32 MB.&nbsp;The number of nuclei is identical to eight per CCD, but the CCX clusters in their former form no longer exist.</p>
<p>The data also provides performance values: these speak of&nbsp;<strong>a +15 percent CPI-related performance increase</strong>&nbsp;for entire workloads.&nbsp;For EPYC processors with up to 32 cores, AMD wants to achieve&nbsp;<strong>a performance increase of +20 percent</strong>&nbsp;compared to ROME processors with Zen2 cores;&nbsp;single thread performance should also increase&nbsp;<strong>by +20 percent</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;For the largest EPYC processors with up to 64 cores, AMD expects a performance increase&nbsp;<strong>of around 10 to 15 percent</strong>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Apparently,&nbsp;<strong>AMD can achieve a higher clock frequency</strong>&nbsp;for processors with fewer cores, so that the increase in performance has a correspondingly greater effect with fewer cores.&nbsp;So far this is not surprising, as it is the expected performance improvement since practically the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>If we want a bigger performance leap, we will have to wait for the&nbsp;<strong>AMD EPYC GENOVA</strong>&nbsp;, where&nbsp;<strong>Zen4 @ 5nm</strong>&nbsp;with TDPs from 120&nbsp;<strong>to 240W</strong>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<strong>DDR5</strong>&nbsp;memory&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>PCI-Express 5.0</strong>&nbsp;interface&nbsp;would come into play&nbsp;, which would arrive at the end of 2021.</p>

For example, we <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-lead-engineer-programming-language-typescript-took-off-thanks-to-googles-angular/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adopted TypeScript in its early days</a> because we wanted all developers using the framework to take advantage of compile-time type checking. This way, we enabled an excellent development experience for everyone with better editor support, allowing people to ship apps with <a href="http://earlbarr.com/publications/typestudy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fewer issues</a>.</p><p id="d454">In <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.angular.io/version-10-of-angular-now-available-78960babd41">v10</a> we announced a <strong>strict opt-in mode that allows us to perform more build-time optimizations and help you deliver faster apps with fewer defects</strong>. This mode is still only an opt-in because it comes with its trade-offs — stricter type checking and extra configuration. <strong>We want to hear from you which of these trade-offs will make you more productive and allow you to deliver better apps.</strong></p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1920/0*DYmwph_Jdr5cqt0T.jpg" width="960" height="640" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*DYmwph_Jdr5cqt0T.jpg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*DYmwph_Jdr5cqt0T.jpg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*DYmwph_Jdr5cqt0T.jpg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*DYmwph_Jdr5cqt0T.jpg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*DYmwph_Jdr5cqt0T.jpg?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="012b">To opt into the strict mode, you need to create a new Angular CLI app, specifying the <code>--strict</code> flag:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="109f">The command above will generate a workspace with the following settings enabled on top of the defaults:</p><ul><li id="baee">Strict mode in TypeScript, as well as other strictness flags recommended by the TypeScript team. Specifically, <code>strict</code>, <code>forceConsistentCasingInFileNames</code>, <code>noImplicitReturns</code>, <code>noFallthroughCasesInSwitch</code></li><li id="ce10">Turns on strict Angular compiler flags <code>strictTemplates</code> and <code>strictInjectionParameters</code></li><li id="4b64">Reduced bundle size budgets by ~75%</li><li id="63c6">Turns on <code>no-any</code> TSLint rule to prevent declarations of type <code>any</code></li><li id="9e06">Marks your application as <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/#mark-the-file-as-side-effect-free" target="_blank" rel="noopener">side-effect free</a> to enable more advanced tree-shaking</li></ul><p id="fc43">Let us look at each one of these in detail.</p><p id="8fca">Researchers have proven empirically that TypeScript’s compiler helps us fix more issues before we ship our app to production. For more details, check <a href="http://earlbarr.com/publications/typestudy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“To Type or Not to Type: Quantifying Detectable Bugs in JavaScript.”</a> To not step on the way of folks getting started with Angular, by default, we currently don’t enable the <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strictest TypeScript compiler options</a> in new CLI workspaces.</p><p id="ce08">One of the first things many developers using Angular do, to get more help from the compiler is to enable the following flags in <code>tsconfig.json</code>:</p><ul><li id="df36"><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strictPropertyInitialization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strictPropertyInitialization</a></li><li id="e383"><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strictNullChecks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strictNullChecks</a></li><li id="bd61"><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#noImplicitAny" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noImplicitAny</a></li><li id="cbbc"><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strictBindCallApply" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strictBindCallApply</a></li><li id="d30b"><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strictFunctionTypes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strictFunctionTypes</a></li></ul><p id="049d">This way, they can more confidently ship to production because the compiler has given them some guarantees that their app aligns to a specific contract, defined by the type system. In the CLI’s strict mode, we enable the <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TypeScript’s </a><code><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict" target="_blank" rel="noopener">s</a>trict</code><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> flag</a>, which turns these on by default.</p><p id="8680">Two of the flags that will have the biggest impact on your development process are <code>strictPropertyInitialization</code> and <code>strictNullChecks</code>. With <code>strictPropertyInitialization</code>, the following snippet will throw a compile-time error because we haven’t initialized <code>title</code>:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="ee12">To fix it, you’d have to either set <code>title</code> to a string value or change its type, for instance:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="b07c">One additional check we’ve enabled is the <code>no-any</code> TSLint rule (yes, we’ll be <a href="https://angular.io/guide/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moving away from TSLint</a>; this rule has its <a href="https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin/docs/rules/no-explicit-any.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ESLint equivalent</a>). This way, we can use more type information during our <code>ng update</code> command and more confidently migrate your apps across Angular versions. Let us look at an example:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="0908">If we wanted to migrate your project away from <code>deprecatedMethod</code> we wouldn’t have been able to given that the type of <code>client</code> is <code>any</code>. To migrate your project with confidence, we’d need the information that <code>client</code> has the type of <code>HttpClient</code> with an explicit type annotation: <code>client: HttpClient</code>. This way we’d know that <code>deprecatedMethod</code> belongs to our migration target rather than it just happened that another object has a method with the same name.</p><p id="1f86">The <code>strictTemplates</code> flag is an Angular specific configuration that strict mode enables under <code>angularCompilerOptions</code> in <code>tsconfig.json</code>. Let’s look at the following snippet:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="541d">Currently, Angular will not perform any type checking at compile-time. If you enable <code>strictTemplates</code>, Angular will check if <code>todo</code> has a property <code>title</code> and if <code>user.isAdmin</code> exists. Additionally, if you have any of the strict TypeScript flags enabled, the Angular compiler will enable the same strictness checks for the template. For example, if we have <code>strictNullChecks</code> and <code>strictTemplates</code> in the following snippet we’ll get a type error:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="7d88">This will help us ensure we’ve initialized <code>article</code> before accessing its property. A way to fix this error would be: <code>&lt;h1&gt;{{ article?.title }}&lt;/h1&gt;</code> using the <a href="https://angular.io/guide/template-expression-operators#the-safe-navigation-operator----and-null-property-paths" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safe navigation operator</a> (similar to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optional chaining</a>).</p><ul><li id="e187"><strong>[Con] </strong>The compiler will be stricter. It will throw compile-time errors if you haven’t initialized a property, check if an expression is null, if you have type errors in your templates, etc. If you want to prototype something rapidly and correctness is not important to you, this may slow you down. Such compile-time errors could also be confusing for people getting started with Angular.</li><li id="7455"><strong>[Pro] </strong><code>strictNullChecks</code> and <code>strictPropertyInitialization</code> will make sure you’re not accessing properties or calling methods of null references.</li><li id="93e7"><strong>[Pro] </strong>Angular will also be able to help you discover more issues ahead of time by type checking your templates.</li></ul><p id="e565"><a href="https://web.dev/performance-budgets-with-the-angular-cli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bundle budgets</a> provide a guarantee that the performance of your app will not unnoticeably regress over time. In Angular CLI’s <code>angular.json</code> file, we have predefined error and warning budgets. If the size of a specific JavaScript bundle or style exceeds the warning budget, you’ll get a warning message; if you exceed the error budget, your build will fail.</p><p id="1361">By default, we’ve set pretty high budgets:</p><ul><li id="00a7">2MB warning and 5MB error budget for the initial JavaScript we send to the browser</li><li id="bd6f">6KB warning and 10KB error budget for the styles of any component</li></ul><p id="9f86">In strict mode, these numbers drop to:</p><ul><li id="2772">500KB warning and 1MB error budget for the initial JavaScript we send to the browser</li><li id="3851">2KB warning and 4KB error budget for the styles of any component</li></ul><p id="94be">To make sure you fit the budget:</p><ul><li id="95ad">Make sure you are aware of what you have in your production bundles. <a href="https://angular.io/guide/deployment#inspect-the-bundles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source-map-explorer</a> will come handy here</li><li id="2c45">Use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.angular.io/angular-tools-for-high-performance-6e10fb9a0f4a">lazy-loading</a></li><li id="024c">Avoid large imports in your component styles</li></ul><ul><li id="8b5c"><strong>[Con]</strong> According to reports we have, over 50% of apps ship more than 1MB of JavaScript. With the tighter bundle budgets, your build will fail if you exceed this number. If the initial load time performance of your app is not critical for your use case, you’ll be getting build failures and you will have to update the budget manually.</li><li id="6652"><strong>[Pro]</strong> If you introduce a large dependency by accident, your build will fail, and you’ll catch the regression ahead of time. Overall, bundle budgets will guard your application against growing in size.</li></ul><p id="5d52">The last strict mode option we will look at is related to tree-shaking. Tree-shaking is a form of dead code elimination, in which the build tooling removes unused code. To enable webpack to remove unused modules, in the strict mode, we create an extra <code>package.json</code> with all of your apps and libraries. This <code>package.json</code> file has a single property - <code>sideEffects</code> set to <code>false</code>.</p><p id="556c">It’s practically impossible to determine with static code analysis if a module produces side effects or not in a language as dynamic as JavaScript. This means that our optimistic assumption may potentially break your app. Let us look into more details what this actually means.</p><p id="a66c">Currently, with the Angular CLI webpack delegates tree-shaking to <a href="https://github.com/terser/terser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">terser</a>, the JavaScript optimizer we use. Let’s look at an example:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="ae4b">Here we have the following dependency graph:</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2128/1*9bGufPhGdGOmdEcaQQjeiQ.png" width="1064" height="776" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*9bGufPhGdGOmdEcaQQjeiQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*9bGufPhGdGOmdEcaQQjeiQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*9bGufPhGdGOmdEcaQQjeiQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*9bGufPhGdGOmdEcaQQjeiQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*9bGufPhGdGOmdEcaQQjeiQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Visualization of the dependency graph</figcaption></figure><p id="ecae">When we run webpack with entry point <code>index.js</code> we’ll get the following output:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="9487">Notice that although we don’t use <code>subtract</code> and <code>PI</code>, they are still in the final bundle. If we run webpack in production mode, terser will statistically determine that we’re only using <code>add</code>, and it will get rid of the exported <code>subtract</code> and <code>PI</code>.</p><p id="99c2">webpack includes the module <code>constants.js</code> in the final bundle only because it’s not sure if it produces side effects or not. For example, if it adds globals, writes to <code>localStorage</code>, or sends HTTP requests, removing this module will break our app.</p><p id="dfcd">Suppose we specify the <code>sideEffects</code> property to <code>false</code> in the corresponding <code>package.json</code> to our project. In that case, webpack will assume <code>utils.js</code>, <code>constants.js</code>, and <code>operations.js</code> do not produce any side effects and will not include the unused modules in the final bundle. Here’s what the final bundle would look like in this case:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="269d">If we enable terser, it’ll get rid of <code>index_subtract</code> and <code>subtract</code> since we don’t use them, and inline <code>add</code>, which will produce:</p><figure><div></div></figure><ul><li id="7f58"><strong>[Con</strong>] You now have multiple <code>package.json</code> files — one for your workspace, and one for each of your libraries and apps. This could be confusing for folks getting started with Angular CLI.</li><li id="8e0b"><strong>[Con</strong>] If you have side effects in any of your modules and webpack tree-shakes it away, you’ll get a runtime error.</li><li id="52d2"><strong>[Pro]</strong> You’ll get smaller apps overall.</li></ul><p id="657d">Let us spend a minute to look at the second point. Imagine <code>constants.js</code> had the following content:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="971a">If we have incorrectly specified the <code>sideEffects</code> flag to <code>false</code> and webpack gets rid of this module since we don’t reference it, the <code>localStorage.setItem('foo', 'bar')</code> statement will not execute. This, later on, can lead to issues in our app if we rely that we have this information in <code>localStorage</code>.</p><p id="1ce1">Everything we mentioned so far has its trade-offs. If we want fewer issues in production, we need to fight with stricter compiler options, and if we want smaller bundles, we may have to enable extra, potentially unsafe configuration.</p><p id="5cb0"><strong>Please comment in this post and let us know which one of these configuration options you want us to enable by default and why.</strong> We’re building the Angular CLI for you, and we want you to be part of the decision process on what features we provide.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<p>The other day I watched “See” on Apple TV+. The premise of the show is that after some apocalyptic event, humanity has lost its sense of sight and all humans are born blind. I quite enjoyed watching it but I can’t say I care much whether it gets extended for another season.</p>

<p>Anyway, one thing they do in the show is tie knots in strings and ropes to communicate. People trace the strings with their fingers, reading them like books. The system is never explained in much detail but people in the show are able to send messages that way. I thought this was a very cool idea and started thinking about how to design a system like that.</p>

<p>Initially, I considered a knot-based morse code with either two types of knots or the presence/absence of one type of knot to represent dots and dashes. Since that would mean up to five knots per letter, however, and I wanted to keep the number of knots as low as possible, I decided to come up with my own encodings of the Latin alphabet. To keep things simple, I used a fixed number of knots per letter.</p>

<p>Given these constraints, I had to decide how many different types of knots my system would be based on. Since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, the only numbers that make sense are 2, 3 and 6. Two types of knots require five knots per letter, three types require three knots and six types require two.</p>

<p>My last major contact with the world of knots was as a young boy on vacation with my parents at the North Sea coast, learning about knots used on fishing ships. Since I don’t remember much about those knots, I hit google to see what was on offer. Turns out that (like for everything in this world) there is a community of knotters online.</p>

<p>To be suitable for this projects, the knots had to fulfil the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Distinctiveness</strong>: they had to be distinct to the touch so that the “reader” could tell them apart without needing a sense of sight.</li>
  <li><strong>Pull resistance</strong>: I’m sure there’s a term of art for this in professional knot tying. The knots should not come undone when pulling on opposite ends of the string.</li>
  <li><strong>Placability</strong>: choosing a location on the string and placing the knot there should be easy. This is probably true for all knots with sufficient practice but it’s easier for some than for others.</li>
  <li><strong>Locality</strong>: it should be possible to tie the knot without having to pull through one end of the string. Turns out there’s a phrase for this, knots of this kind are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bight_%28knot%29%23In_the_bight">tied in the bight</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://soender.blog/images/knots/test-knots2.jpg" alt="test-knots">
<em>Testing different knots. Turns out twisted twine is not ideal for tying knots.</em></p>

<p>After an evening of playing around with different knots, these are the ones I ended up choosing:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhand_knot"><strong>Overhand</strong></a>: this is the most fundamental knot and my go-to to tie anything together.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_loop"><strong>Butterfly</strong></a>: this knot creates a nice distinctive loop.</li>
  <li><strong>Butterfly + 1</strong>: this is what I called a butterfly knot with an additional overhand knot in the loop.</li>
  <li><strong>Butterfly + 2</strong>: same as above but with two overhand knots.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.101knots.com/barrel-knot.html"><strong>Barrel</strong></a>: this knot creates barrel along the string.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_figure-eight_loop"><strong>Double figure-eight</strong></a>: a knot that forms two loops.</li>
</ul>

<p>Six knots with two knots per character give us 6^2 = 36 possible combinations which is exactly what we need for 26 letters and 10 digits (no spaces or lowercase letters exist in this encoding). One optimisation I made in mapping these combinations to the different letters and digits was to assign each knot a difficulty value (turns out I was pretty off in my guesses of how difficult each knot would be to tie). Each possible combination of two knots then had a combined difficulty equal to the sum of the difficulties of each constituent knot. I assigned the letters in order of frequency such that the most frequent letters would be easiest to tie, the remaining ten combinations I assigned to the ten digits at random. This is the mapping I ended up with:</p>

<p><img src="https://soender.blog/images/knots/mapping.jpg" alt="test-knots">
<em>Mapping knots to letters &amp; digits.</em></p>

<p>Reading about knots online, I discovered that paracord is the medium of choice for people who pursue this hobby. I got some and it is a much more pleasurable experience to tie with compared to the cheap twine I was using before. Another purchase I made was what seems to be the authoritative source on knots: The Ashley Book of Knots. I have only skimmed the book so far but if I ever make a version two of the speaking knots, I’m certain it will be a repository of possible knots to integrate into any future encoding.</p>

<p>After tying a few one letter strings, I eventually tied this seven meter beast:</p>

<p><img src="https://soender.blog/images/knots/human-rights.jpg" alt="human-rights">
<em>“All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights”</em></p>

<p>After trying out the system, here are some things I learned about the different knots:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Overhand</strong>: the fact that this is not tied in the bight makes this much more annoying to tie than I first thought. I would not include this knot again for this reason.</li>
  <li><strong>Butterfly</strong>: this knot and its variants are perfectly suited for this project and don’t have any downsides.</li>
  <li><strong>Barrel</strong>: this knot is aesthetically pleasing but not only is it not tied in the bight, it needs three pull-throughs to be completed! There does seem to be a variant of it that doesn’t have this downside but I haven’t played with it yet.</li>
  <li><strong>Double figure-eight</strong>: this knot works but it wastes a lot of string and has a very thick main part that the two loops grow out of. It’s also hard to distinguish from the butterfly by touch alone.</li>
</ul>

<p>I might decide to spend more time on this project in the future but for now, I’m happy with how much fun I’ve already had with it. If I do, these are some ideas for possibly improvements and additions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Different knots/different mapping based on what I learned about the knots I chose.</li>
  <li>Some way of preventing the reader to get out of sync with which pairs on the string form the letters. If either the author or the reader of the message accidentally skip one knot, the message ends up garbled. This isn’t a big issue since when that happens, all that’s required is to shift one knot and try again.</li>
  <li>Single knots for common letters or even words to speed up the tying process. This would also help with synchronisation.</li>
  <li>Some way of indicating the direction a string is meant to be read in. Maybe a bead tied into the string. I considered beads also as part of the encoding but decided against it so that no additional material would be needed to write a message.</li>
  <li>Splicing together pieces of string. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_knot">blood knot</a> should make this possible. Since it looks very similar to the barrel knot that’s part of the current encoding, I would probably have to choose between the two. This could indicate a space. Assembling longer messages from multiple pieces of string would also somewhat solve the problem of having to tie knots that are not died in the bight in long pieces of string.</li>
  <li>The distance between two knots could be integrated into the encoding and assigned some significance.</li>
  <li>Maybe some completely different way of encoding meaning that isn’t based on the Latin alphabet. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorthand">Shorthand</a> could be a possible source of inspiration for a writing system that is designed for speed. Googling for similar ideas, I found the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quipu">Quipu</a> system used by the Inca people. I couldn’t find much about how specifically it worked and maybe that knowledge isn’t extant but it would be cool to learn more about it.</li>
</ul>

August 28, 2020 | https://www.beondeck.com/post/the-magic-of-engineered-serendipity | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.beondeck.com/post/the-magic-of-engineered-serendipity">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the beginning of this year, I joined <a href="https://www.beondeck.com/" target="_blank"><strong>On Deck</strong></a> – a fellowship of entrepreneurs at various stages of launching their startups – with the goal of expanding my professional network in the Bay Area and finding a co-founder for my next venture.</p><p>‍</p><p>On Deck was designed as a 10-week onsite program, with social events such as weekend trips, lunches, etc. However, no one had anticipated a global pandemic to strike, and On Deck had to switch to fully remote operations even before the group had a chance to meet in person.</p><p>‍</p><p>The decision to continue as a remote program came a few weeks before the cohort start date. By then, I have already flown into San Francisco, rented a place, and was testing several startup ideas. As such, the announcement was a huge blow to me, and I was disheartened to learn that the sessions would be conducted online. All the dinners, parties and team bonding activities I was looking forward to have been replaced with Slack chats and Zoom calls.</p><p>‍</p><p>In retrospect, it is incredible how quickly On Deck managed to reorganize the entire curriculum into a fully-remote event. Kudos to their swift response and hard work in making On Deck 2020 possible! If they had cancelled the cohort, I would not have met all the amazing people and my co-founder.</p><p>‍</p><h3>So how did it all play out?</h3><p>The first day started with a 4-hour virtual kickoff session. We were split into groups and played icebreaker games. Through introductions, games, and breakout activities, we got to know everyone in the cohort.</p><p>‍</p><p>Without us knowing at the time, our groups were not random. On Deck evaluated the participants and thoughtfully paired those with complementary skills together. Therefore, it was not entirely coincidental that the first person I spoke to that day became my co-founder (months later).

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2 id="4cd9">When you are building Kubernetes applications, itâ€™s easy to end up in with â€œauthentication sprawlâ€� where all of your services have different authentication mechanisms. This tutorial walks through how to centralize your authentication mechanisms using an IdP and an API gateway.</h2><div><div><div><p><a href="https://blog.getambassador.io/@alex_gervais?source=post_page-----d509ffbc7b6f----------------------" rel="noopener"><img alt="Alex Gervais" src="https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/1*qrt6AVoODoXwvJUGbeuv0w.jpeg" width="48" height="48"></a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><p id="dcd5"><a href="https://www.keycloak.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keycloak</a> is a widely adopted Identity and Access Management (<a href="https://www.getambassador.io/learn/kubernetes-glossary/iam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IAM for short</a>) open-source solution. 2014 was a big year for groundbreaking technologies as both the Keycloak and Kubernetes projects were initially released a few weeks apart. Unsurprisingly, many Kubernetes end-users are turning to Keycloak as the preferred way to manage access to the secure APIs and services of their platform.</p><p id="3311">Simply running Keycloak in Kubernetes wonâ€™t however make your platform secure. A lot of concerns are left to the user to configure and implement: from exposing the Keycloak API endpoints using TLS and an <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ingress-controller</a>, to enforcing security policies on specific business endpoints. When solving these problems, we have a bias towards using an API Gateway solution to handle encrypted connections and centralize API management policies instead of re-implementing authentication strategies in every language and application of your microservice architecture.</p><p id="a6b3">Our goal today will be to install Keycloak as our IAM solution and secure it behind the <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ambassador Edge Stack</a>, our API Gateway acting as a Kubernetes ingress controller. As a final step, we will deploy a sample application and demonstrate how to use Keycloak as an Identity provider (<a href="https://www.getambassador.io/learn/kubernetes-glossary/idp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IdP for short</a>) to restrict access to this application with OAuth2 using request Filters.</p><p id="0895">In this tutorial, we will use a non-production-ready Keycloak installation. To simplify our dependency graph, weâ€™ll use the in-memory datastore, which is totally suitable for a demo but wouldnâ€™t guarantee high-availability in a production environment. If you are looking for production-grade persistence, <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_installation/index.html#_database" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keycloak offers a variety of storage solutions</a>.</p><p id="eedf">The ingress controller is the missing building block in most Kubernetes offerings. Although Kubernetes defines an Ingress resource, it is not actually backed by any implementation that will turn the resource into a public service! The choice and installation of an ingress solution are left to the operator. Here, we will use the community version of the Ambassador Edge Stack, because of its direct integration with Keycloak for authentication, to expose and secure public traffic coming in from internet requests to downstream private services running in our Kubernetes cluster.</p><p id="c455">At the end of the tutorial, weâ€™ll be up and running with the Ambassador Edge Stack doing TLS termination at the edge of the Kubernetes network, exposing our Keycloak installation under <code>/auth/</code> and securing our Quote application under <code>/backend/</code>.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1496/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png" width="748" height="520" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="4461">Scaffolding with the K8s Initializer</h2><p id="0bfb">Kubernetes is often made fun of because of the copious amounts of YAML required. Instead of going into a scavenger hunt for YAML samples and assembling all puzzle pieces together from stale sources, weâ€™ll be using the <a href="https://app.getambassador.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K8s Initializer</a> to generate all of the Kubernetes resources for us. The K8s Initializer is a project generator tool similar to what exists for application developers: think Spring Initializr or Yeoman.</p><p id="0d5d">The wizard-like interface of the K8s Initializer will guide us through a few questions to understand and configure specific settings that vary from one cloud provider to the other. These implementation details are often where promises are broken and portability falls short, making it hard to configure ingress controllers and expose services to public traffic. Hopefully, we can do away with the little gotchas by using a comprehensive tool like the K8s Initializer who will provide us with an optimal configuration.</p><p id="b086">Specifically for this tutorial, we picked our target Kubernetes cluster: â€œGoogle Kubernetes Engineâ€� with a â€œGoogle External Load Balancer (L4)â€� load balancer. We also chose a public Hostname for our installation. Using a public hostname will require an extra step to configure a DNS entry to point to our installation, but given we want to demonstrate how to build a public secure application stack, itâ€™s worth the extra effort. As for the K8s Initializerâ€™s Auth configuration, we undoubtedly selected Keycloak, with a temporary password.</p><p id="8d03">Once satisfied with our K8s Initializer options, we hit the â€œdownloadâ€� button. Weâ€™ll be given a set of ready-to-go YAML files and instructions.</p><p id="21d8">Give it a try! <a href="https://app.getambassador.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://app.getambassador.io/</a></p><h2 id="56e8">Installing the Ambassador Edge Stack</h2><p id="fad2">Weâ€™ll start by installing the Ambassador Edge Stack simply because it contains a bunch of <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions</a> dependencies. Given you have access to your desired Kubernetes cluster, the installation will be as simple as running <code>kubectl apply</code> commands and configuring a DNS entry to point to the external IP of the provisioned service.</p><h2 id="d5bb">Installing Keycloak</h2><p id="4d13">Installing Keycloak from the generated YAML is again straightforward: a single <code>kubectl apply</code> command. One curious cat might peek at the Keycloak YAML file, donâ€™t worry it wonâ€™t kill you! Youâ€™ll actually be able to appreciate how the <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/docs/latest/topics/using/intro-mappings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ambassador Mapping</a> resource will instruct traffic hitting the public <code>/auth/</code> prefix endpoint to be forwarded to our private Keycloak pod running in our Kubernetes cluster.</p><p id="f8e2">Giving Keycloak a few minutes to start, weâ€™ll then be able to access itâ€™s UI at <a href="https://domain-name/auth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://domain-name/auth/</a>. Since we chose to let â€œ<em>Ambassador terminate TLS using a Letâ€™s Encrypt certificateâ€�</em> in the K8s Initializer options, we can appreciate how automatic TLS termination is happening with a secure certificate for our Keycloak installation.</p><p id="e690">We can then log in to Keycloakâ€™s Administration Console UI using the default <code>admin</code> username and the temporary password weâ€™ve selected previously to configure Keycloak to our needsâ€¦ and change the password!</p><h2 id="befa">Configuring a Keycloak Realm, Client and User</h2><p id="a442">To secure our APIs, we will be using our shiny new Keycloak installation as our IdP. We first need to create a client to handle authentication requests from Ambassador Edge Stack. All of these configuration steps can be achieved using the Keycloak UI.</p><ol><li id="06c0">We first start by creating a new â€œRealmâ€�. Hovering on top of the â€œMasterâ€� label in the right-hand navigation, we can click on â€œAdd realmâ€�. We picked <code>ambassador</code> as the â€œNameâ€� of our new realm. This will be needed later on to configure the <code>authorizationURL</code> field in the auth Filter.</li><li id="6e10">Weâ€™ll create a new client by navigating to â€œClientsâ€� and clicking â€œCreateâ€�. We chose the following settings: <br>- <em>Client ID</em>: <code>ambassador</code> â€” This value will be used in the <code>clientID</code> field of the auth Filter.<br>- <em>Client Protocol</em>: <code>openid-connect</code><br>- <em>Root URL</em>: None, left blank</li><li id="5859">On the following screen, we configured the Client with:<br>- <em>Access Type</em>: <code>confidential</code><br>- <em>Valid Redirect URIs</em>: <code>*</code></li><li id="2392">Navigating to the â€œMappersâ€� tab in our Client, we clicked â€œCreateâ€� and used the following settings:<br>- <em>Protocol</em>: <code>openid-connect</code><br>- <em>Name</em>: <code>Ambassador Mapper</code><br>- <em>Mapper Type</em>: <code>Audience</code><br>- <em>Included Client Audience</em>: Select the name of the Client from the dropdown. Remember, we named our Client <code>ambassador</code>.</li><li id="cde8">Going back to our <code>ambassador</code> Client, we navigated to the â€œClient Scopesâ€� section and configured our Client for <code>offline_access</code>.</li><li id="6c77">Back again to our <code>ambassador</code> Client, we then navigated to the â€œCredentialsâ€� section. We took note of the â€œSecretâ€� value as it will be used later when configuring our auth Filter.</li></ol><p id="aeec">Along with our Client configuration, letâ€™s configure a Keycloak â€œUserâ€�:</p><ol><li id="2481">Navigating to the â€œUsersâ€� section of the Keycloak Administration Console, we will click on â€œAdd userâ€�. We gave our user a simple username: <code>my-keycloak-user</code>, then clicked â€œSaveâ€�.</li><li id="c77c">On the following screen, we switched to the Userâ€™s â€œCredentialsâ€� tab to set a temporary password.</li></ol><p id="b25e">Now that we have a user with which we are able to authenticate ourselves with, letâ€™s deploy an application.</p><h2 id="49f6">Deploying a Quote service</h2><p id="902c">Deploying custom applications on Kubernetes is achieved by creating some Kubernetes resources defined asâ€¦ You guessed it, more YAML! This time, since we are deploying a sample backend application, the sample is somewhat lightweight. You can save the following definitions to a â€œquote-service.yamlâ€� file and deploy it using <code>kubectl apply -f quote-service.yaml</code>.</p><pre><span id="4f23">---<br>apiVersion: v1<br>kind: Service<br>metadata:<br>  name: quote<br>  namespace: default<br>spec:<br>  ports:<br>  - name: http<br>    port: 80<br>    targetPort: 8080<br>  selector:<br>    app: quote<br>---<br>apiVersion: apps/v1<br>kind: Deployment<br>metadata:<br>  name: quote<br>  namespace: default<br>spec:<br>  replicas: 1<br>  selector:<br>    matchLabels:<br>      app: quote<br>  strategy:<br>    type: RollingUpdate<br>  template:<br>    metadata:<br>      labels:<br>        app: quote<br>    spec:<br>      containers:<br>      - name: backend<br>        image: docker.io/datawire/quote:0.4.1<br>        ports:<br>        - name: http<br>          containerPort: 8080<br>---<br>apiVersion: getambassador.io/v2<br>kind: Mapping<br>metadata:<br>  name: quote-backend<br>  namespace: default<br>spec:<br>  prefix: /backend/<br>  service: quote</span></pre><p id="c66d">This will create a Kubernetes <code>Deployment</code>, <code>Service</code>, and <code>Mapping</code> to publicly expose our running Quote application under the <code>/backend/</code> path. Give it a try, itâ€™s currently unprotected: <a href="https://domain-name/backend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://domain-name/backend/</a>.</p><h2 id="dbb3">Securing access</h2><p id="1525">Building on the configurations we applied to our Keycloak installation in the â€œConfiguring a Keycloak Realm, Client and Userâ€� section earlier, weâ€™ll be creating an OAuth2 <code>Filter</code> and <code>FilterPolicy</code> resources in Kubernetes. Donâ€™t forget to replace the placeholders in this YAML sample with the values from your installation! Once again, save the following definitions to a â€œkeycloak-filter.yamlâ€� file and deploy it using <code>kubectl apply -f keycloak-filter.yaml</code>.</p><pre><span id="31c3">---<br>apiVersion: getambassador.io/v2<br>kind: Filter<br>metadata:<br>  name: keycloak-filter<br>  namespace: ambassador<br>spec:<br>  OAuth2:<br>    authorizationURL: https://{domain-name}/auth/realms/ambassador<br>    audience: ambassador<br>    clientID: ambassador<br>    secret: {client_secret}<br>    protectedOrigins:<br>    …</span></pre></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Alongside the slew of new features added in iOS 13 was a small
(but delightful!) one: when cropping an image in the screenshot preview window, the crop boundaries
would now subtly snap to certain elements in the image:</p><video playsinline="" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" preload="auto" data-setup="{}">
<source src="https://bryce.co/screenshot-cropping/settings-crop-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://bryce.co/" type="video/webm"><source src="https://bryce.co/" type="video/ogg"></video><p>There was some speculation around how this feature worked — common guesses on a few sites
included edge detection, machine learning, or just… something simpler.</p><p>Turns out, it's that last one! Shoutout to
<a href="https://twitter.com/rydermackay/">Ryder Mackay</a>
for owning the only real
<a href="https://twitter.com/rydermackay/status/1219341583251918849">google result</a>
for <code>SSScreenshotMetadataHarvester</code>&nbsp;— the class that handles this logic, and the focus
of this post.</p><p>We'll look at how the metadata harvester works, how to feed extra data to it, and how to completely
break this form of screenshot cropping.</p><blockquote><p>Note: Like so many things on this site, this is much more of a curiosity than
something you should actually do in a production app, especially given how awkward
the implementation is. If you did want to leverage Apple
internals — why waste it on something like this?
<a href="https://bryce.co/recreating-imessage-confetti/">Add some confetti</a> or something instead.</p></blockquote><p><code>SSScreenshotMetadataHarvester</code> (pronounced “ssssscreenshot-metadata-harvester”, as far as I'm concerned),
is the primary class responsible for collecting screenshot information from your app.</p><p>When a screenshot is taken,
<code>SSScreenshotMetadataHarvester</code> will work with your app to generate a full-page PDF-based screenshot
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscreenshotservicedelegate">if you provide one</a>, but otherwise,
it will simply collect two pieces of metadata: the current <code>NSUserActivity</code>'s title, and the bounds of
any “important views” that are present on the screen.</p><p>You can easily see this bounds-collection system in action using <code>lldb</code>. First, set a breakpoint
on <code>_contentRectsForMetadata</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span>(</span><span>lldb</span><span>)</span> <span>b</span> <span>+</span><span>[</span><span>SSScreenshotMetadataHarvester</span> <span>_contentRectsForMetadata</span><span>]</span>

<span>WARNING</span><span>:</span>  <span>Unable</span> <span>to</span> <span>resolve</span> <span>breakpoint</span> <span>to</span> <span>any</span> <span>actual</span> <span>locations</span><span>.</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Note that the breakpoint wasn't able to resolve to an actual address —
that's because <code>ScreenshotServices.framework</code> is loaded dynamically, and (in my case)
I haven't taken a screenshot yet. But <code>lldb</code> will resolve the correct location
as soon as the framework is loaded later anyways.</p><p>Next, we'll take a screenshot, and execution will pause.
We can then step out of <code>_contentRectsForMetadata</code> and inspect the
return value in register <code>x0</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span>// Breakpoint triggered in `_contentRectsForMetadata`:
</span><span></span><span>(</span><span>lldb</span><span>)</span> <span>thread</span> <span>step</span><span>-</span><span>out</span>

<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>And there we have it! That array contains the rects that our screenshots will snap to
when cropping.</p><p>The views we're collecting bounds from belong to two categories:</p><ol><li>The root view of any view controllers that are currently added to the hierarchy</li><li>If visible, the frame of the on-screen keyboard (sometimes)</li></ol><p>The second category here is somewhat interesting — the keyboard's frame is based on
a call to <code>+[UIPeripheralHost visiblePeripheralFrame]</code>, which doesn't account for
the iPad's floating or split keyboard modes.</p><p>We're not here to talk about keyboards though, so let's look at the more interesting
side of the metadata: view controllers’ view bounds.</p><h4 id="view-controller-traversal">View Controller Traversal</h4><p>The algorithm for finding each view frame traverses the view
controller hierarchy by looking at each view controller's child
view controllers and presented view controller (if any).</p><p>For each of these, the bounds of the view controller's root view
is taken, minus any safe area insets; the bounds are then converted

</code></pre></div><p>So in a nutshell, view controllers are really what drives the snap areas here.</p><h4 id="-not--abusing-ios-screenshot-cropping-mechanism"><em>Not</em> Abusing iOS’ Screenshot Cropping Mechanism</h4><p>To start with, given that view controllers determine snap areas, it's worth
pointing out that strategic use of child view controllers can actually get you
nicer snap areas somewhat naturally.</p><p>You can even take this to some extremes, like making collection view cell contents
backed by their own view controllers, as discussed in
<a href="https://twitter.com/khanlou">Soroush Khanlou</a>‘s
<a href="https://khanlou.com/2015/04/view-controllers-in-cells/">original article</a>, or
<a href="https://twitter.com/wibosco">William Boles</a>’
<a href="https://williamboles.me/hosting-viewcontrollers-in-cells/">excellent follow-up</a>.
In fact, William's demo project acts as a great example of this behavior:</p><video playsinline="" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" preload="auto" data-setup="{}">
<source src="https://bryce.co/screenshot-cropping/collectionview-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://bryce.co/" type="video/webm"><source src="https://bryce.co/" type="video/ogg"></video><p>I wouldn't advocate for structuring your app any differently just
for the minor benefit of nicer cropping for screenshots — especially
something as involved as view controllers within cells.</p><p>But, if you find yourself in a scenario where you're deciding whether or
not to use child view controllers in a given situation — keep in mind that
this is one interesting advantage, however small!</p><h4 id="defining-arbitrary-snap-areas">Defining Arbitrary Snap Areas</h4><p>There are two options for modifying the screenshot snap areas,
both of which are a bit terrible.</p><p>The first option is to simply add empty child view controllers
defining the areas you're interested in. By manipulating
the view controller's root view bounds and safe area insets, you can add
arbitrary snap areas. You don't even need to add the view to the parent's
view hierarchy —&nbsp;only a call to <code>-[UIViewController addChildViewController:]</code> is
needed.</p><p>However, this is… questionable at best. In my case, I'd much rather
just swizzle. The setup is made a bit more complex due to us not being able
to use a category (since the class isn't available at link or launch time),
and due to it being a class method.</p><p>There are a few ways around this, like forcing a dependency on
<code>ScreenshotServices.framework</code>, but this all-in-code setup is the cleanest I've come up with:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span>// Holds the original implementation of

</code></pre></div><p>With this setup, we can now add arbitrary bounds as desired — but that by itself
is not too interesting. Instead, let's look at how we can use this ability
to modify the screenshot cropping system even more.</p><h4 id="building-stronger-snaps">Building Stronger Snaps</h4><p>There's a fun consequence of the snapping implementation in that, if multiple snap areas
are in close proximity, they'll essentially merge together.</p><p>More concretely, once the cropping tool has snapped to one rect, it will
continue snapping to rects further along in the returned values array.</p><p>This means order matters; if we return snapping rects
with <code>origin.x</code> values of…</p><div><pre><code data-lang="plain">origin.x = 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
</code></pre></div><p>… then cropping to anywhere near the 10-14 range will result in a snap to <code>14</code>.
But if we reverse the rect order…</p><div><pre><code data-lang="plain">origin.x = 14, 13, 12, 11, 10
</code></pre></div><p>… then we will snap to <code>10</code> instead!</p><p>We can also add rects approaching from both directions to hone in on an area from either side.
This gives us the ability to inflate the snap distance from the default
(of only a few points) to any arbitrarily large margin:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span>// In `swizzled_contentRectsForMetadata`...

	<p><small>August 28, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>The news of the time interval is that Firefox 80 is out and in
theory it can support hardware video acceleration on X11, not just
Wayland (<a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2020/08/firefox-80-release-linux-gpu-acceleration">source</a>,
<a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Firefox-80-Released">also</a>).
The master Mozilla tracking bug for hardware accelerated video on
X11 is <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1619523">bug #1619523</a>, with all
sorts of information. So I downloaded the official release (one of
my Firefox setups uses the official builds these days for reasons
beyond the scope of this entry) and tried to get it to do accelerated
video playback. The short version is that I think I've failed, but I'm
not sure why.</p>

<p>Even in Firefox 80, getting VA-API accelerated video playback
requires a whole series of magic incantations in <code>about:config</code>
preferences and perhaps environment variables when you start Firefox
(this may change in the next release). Assuming that all of those
are set right, Firefox can apparently still decide that it doesn't
like your Linux video driver (or its version), your specific hardware,
or perhaps either or both of the resolution of the source video and
the resolution of your display. Some or many of these can be forced
with Firefox settings, but at the same time the bug reports I've
read say that sometimes Firefox ignores hardware acceleration because
it's slower for the specific circumstances, or because it has known
bugs. If Firefox is making a sensible decision for <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/HomeMachine2018">my specific
hardware</a>, that's one thing and I want
it to do what will work best. But if I've missed a setting or if
Firefox is just being twitchy about something, I also want to
override it. In general I know my hardware is capable of hardware
accelerated playback of videos at far lower CPU usage than Firefox
manages (on the same videos).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Firefox won't tell me what it's doing or why, at
least not in a way that I can understand. I've peered into the
depths of <code>about:support</code>, which tells me some of the 'what' but
not the 'why', and I've tried some of the things from <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1619523">bug #1619523</a>
without success. If Firefox is or isn't going to do hardware
accelerated video playback, I wish it would tell me both what it was
doing and why. Otherwise I'm probably going to go on being confused
and annoyed with it.</p>

<p>(I care about hardware acceleration not just because of CPU load
but because my perception is that hardware acceleration is necessary
to play back a full sized video smoothly without dropping frames
every so often. This may be wrong on modern hardware, even on my 4k
display.)</p>

				<p> &gt;&gt;&gt; What is Pointer?</p>
				<p> Pointer is a reading club for developers. It's a window into what other current and future CTOs are reading and thinking about. Super high quality engineering-related content, not just trendy topics or link bait.</p>
			</div>	
			
			<div>
				<p> &gt;&gt;&gt; What kind of content belongs in Pointer?</p>
				<p> Anything worth reading. It can be language-specific or framework-agnostic, or not even strictly technical as long as it's relevant to a developer. Folks have shared interesting open source projects, a blog post on engineering cultural anti-patterns, and even an academic CS paper from 1982 about why counting starts with 0.</p>

<p><strong>By Chris Hedges</strong> / Original to Scheerpost</p>



<p>The persecution of the attorney Steven Donziger is a grim illustration of what happens when we confront the real centers of power, masked and unacknowledged by the divisive cant from the Trump White House or the sentimental drivel of the Democratic Party. Those, like Donziger, who name and fight the corporate control of our society on behalf of the vulnerable see the judiciary, the press and the institutions of government unite to crucify them.</p>



<p>“It’s been a long battle, 27 years,” Donziger said when I reached him by phone in his apartment in Manhattan.</p>



<p>Donziger, who has been fighting polluting American oil companies for nearly three decades on behalf of indigenous communities and peasant farmers in Ecuador, has been under house arrest in Manhattan for a year.&nbsp;He will go to trial in federal court in New York on September 9 on contempt of court charges, which could see him jailed for six months.&nbsp;Ever&nbsp;since he won a multibillion-dollar judgment in 2011 against the oil giant Chevron, the multinational has come after him personally through litigation that threatens to destroy him economically, professionally and personally.</p>



<p>“Our L-T [long-term] strategy is to demonize Donziger,” Chevron wrote in an internal memo in 2009, as reviewed<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.courthousenews.com/when-feds-demur-judge-charges-ecuador-crusader-himself/" target="_blank"> by Courthouse News</a>.</p>

<hr>



<p>“It started when Texaco went into Ecuador in the Amazon in the 1960s and cut a sweetheart deal with the military government then ruling Ecuador,” Donziger told me. “Over the next 25 years, Texaco was the exclusive operator of a very large area of the Amazon that had several oil fields within this area, 1500 square miles. They drilled hundreds of wells. They created thousands of open-air, unlined toxic waste pits where they dumped the heavy metals and toxins that came up from the ground when they drilled. They ran pipes from the pits into rivers and streams that local people relied on for their drinking water, their fishing and their sustenance. They poisoned this pristine ecosystem, in which lived five indigenous peoples, as well as a lot of other nonindigenous rural communities. There was a mass industrial poisoning.”</p>



<p>“By the time I went down there in the early 1990s, many people had died, cancer rates were skyrocketing according to several independent health evaluations, people were really hurting. There was zero regard for the lives of the local people by Texaco. I was a very young lawyer back in 1993 when I first went to Ecuador. It was like looking at an apocalyptic scene. There was oil on the roads. People were living in abject poverty. They had no shoes. They would get oil on their feet when they walked along the roads. The oil pollution had permeated every aspect of daily life. It was in the food supply. It was in the water supply. It was in the air. The average person there would get exposed multiple times a day to very harmful, cancer-causing toxins, with foreseeable results.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“I, with other lawyers, filed a lawsuit in New York against Texaco. The reason we filed in New York was because Texaco’s headquarters were in New York in 1993. The decisions to pollute in Ecuador, to play God to the people of Ecuador, were made in New York. We sued in New York. Texaco tried to get the case back to Ecuador where they had never been held accountable, where they knew the indigenous peoples had no money or resources to find lawyers.”</p>



<p>“They thought it would just go away,” said Donziger. “Over a 10-year period, we battled to get a jury trial in the United States. Ultimately, they won that part of the battle. It went down to Ecuador.”</p>



<p>“We started working with a team of Ecuadoran lawyers in the early 2000s. We went forward with the lawsuit. We produced voluminous scientific and testimonial evidence, showing that they caused probably the world’s worst oil pollution. It was called the ‘Amazon Chernobyl’ by locals and experts. They dumped 16 billion gallons of toxic waste. They did it deliberately to save money. This was unlike the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico, which was a terrible accident, even though it was a product of horrendous negligence by BP. This was done by design to pollute, knowing that people would die, and that indigenous groups would be decimated, and that this beautiful part of the Amazon would be destroyed.”</p>



<p>The refusal to abide by even minimal environmental regulations saved Texaco an estimated $3 on every barrel of oil produced over 26 years (1964-1992), <a href="https://amazonwatch.org/news/2019/0625-chevrons-corrupt-legal-practices-called-out-by-leading-human-rights-and-environmental-ngos">according to Amazon Watch</a>, or an estimated extra $5 billion in revenue. The hundreds of waste pits the company eventually abandoned in Ecuador, on average, contain 200 times the contamination allowed by typical global standards.</p>



<p>“They tried to grind us down using classic corporate defense tactics,” Donziger said of the legal war. “They filed thousands of motions. We stood strong. We had a great legal team of Ecuadorian lawyers.”</p>



<p>In the end, they won a stunning victory, a rare moment of accountability for first-world conglomerates who rape the environment of developing nations by exploiting weak, corrupt governments.</p>



<p>“The verdict came down, about $18 billion in favor of the affected communities, which is what it would take at a minimum to clean up the actual damage and compensate the people for some of their injuries. That eventually got reduced on appeal in Ecuador to $9.5 billion, but it was affirmed by three appellate courts, including the highest court of Ecuador. It was <a href="https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/ecuadorians-can-sue-chevron-in-canada-supreme-court-rules/">affirmed by the Canadian Supreme Court</a>, where the Ecuadorians went to enforce their judgment in a unanimous opinion in 2015.”</p>



<p>Chevron, as the evidence mounted against it, sold their assets in Ecuador and left the country. The corporation threatened the plaintiffs with <a href="https://www.chevron.com/stories/chevron-calls-for-dismissal-of-ecuador-lawsuit">a “lifetime of litigation”</a> if they attempted to collect, and, according to internal Chevron memos, launched a legal and media campaign that has cost an estimated $2 billion to prevent payment of the settlement and to demonize and destroy Donziger.</p>

<p>Donziger came to his epic battle against Chevron through journalism. “I was a journalist on my college newspaper,” he said of his time as a history major at American University. “My first job out of college was as a journalist with [United Press International]. I worked for UPI in Washington. They were strong in Latin America. I traveled to Managua in 1983 or 1984, I don’t remember exactly, and found work in the UPI bureau. I was 23 years old. I worked in the UPI bureau in Managua during the Sandinista era.”</p>



<p>He left UPI after a year in Managua but stayed on in Nicaragua to work as a freelance journalist for newspapers such as <em>The Fort Lauderdale News, The Toronto Star</em> and <em>The Atlanta Constitution</em>. He spent about three years as a reporter before going to Harvard Law School. When he graduated from Harvard Law School in 1991, he worked as a public defender in Washington, D.C. He documented Iraqi civilian casualties in Iraq following the first Gulf War that became a report adopted by the United Nations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A classmate at law school was from Ecuador. His classmate’s father organized a trip in April 1993 for lawyers and medical professionals to look at the contamination caused by the oil extraction in the Amazon. That trip, which Donziger joined, spawned the suit against Texaco. He would make more than 250 trips to Ecuador over the next two decades.</p>



<p>“Journalism significantly shaped my views and skill set,” he said. “It was vital to allowing my work to be successful. From the beginning this was a unique litigation, for many reasons, but one of the reasons was we, as a team, decided to work across multiple platforms. If we only saw this case as a lawsuit we would never win.”</p>



<p>“Chevron controlled the legal system in Ecuador with their influence. We needed to operate across different platforms, including engaging with the media and carrying out significant public education. Most Ecuadoreans, other than those who lived in the region, knew nothing about the pollution that had been happening in their country. We carried out zealous advocacy in the public arena. We realized that the indigenous people would never get a fair trial in Ecuador if they did not illuminate what had happened to them and get public support.”</p>



<blockquote><p>“The fact that I am detained shows how far we’ve come and how much risk Chevron feels. It’s not a sign we lost. It’s the opposite.”</p><cite>Steven Donziger</cite></blockquote>



<p>Both the judge who oversaw its lawsuit against Donziger for “racketeering” and Chevron itself “claim that this type of activity is wrong,” he said. “The irony is that what we were doing is what the big oil companies have always done. They always operate in the public relations domain, lobbying Congress to pass legislation to extinguish various legal claims, meeting political leaders …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/06/16/bootstrap-5-alpha/">Bootstrap 5 Alpha</a>&nbsp;was released in June 2020. The new Bootstrap removes jQuery and no longer supports Internet Explorer (IE). The team said it’s time to move on from “what’s outdated or no longer appropriate”.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap framework</a>, originally developed and open-sourced by Twitter, has been an indispensable tool for web developers. It provides a ready-to-use set of UI components and a grid system essential for adaptive web pages that need to display well across PC and mobile browsers. Since its inception, Bootstrap has always had a dependency on the jQuery framework. The&nbsp;<a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery framework</a>, originally created in 2006, is one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks of all time. It provides powerful language features and cross-browser compatibility in an era when web technologies are going through many challenges and experimentations to support a variety of use cases ranging from interactive web pages, single-page apps, AJAX requests, and mobile web apps.</p>



<p>Fast-forward to 2020, with JavaScript standards and dominant web browsers already supporting most of the features in jQuery, the Bootstrap team decided to move on. The Bootstrap 5 framework has removed jQuery as a requirement. It saved 85KB of minified JavaScript, which could be significant as Google starts to&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/07/search-ads-speed">use page speed as a ranking factor for mobile web sites</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience.html">soon for desktop web sites</a>&nbsp;as well. The Bootstrap team does this because Bootstrap 5 also no longer supports&nbsp;Internet Explorer. The team noted that all supported browsers provide jQuery replacement features in vanilla JavaScript. The decision to drop Internet Explorer is probably due to the fact that&nbsp;<a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/worldwide">IE’s market share has now dropped below 3% even among Desktop PC users</a>.</p>



<p>Developer&nbsp;<a href="https://flaviocopes.com/">Flavio Copes</a>&nbsp;has an article on&nbsp;<a href="https://flaviocopes.com/jquery/">“Should you use or learn jQuery in 2020.”</a>&nbsp;In it, he pointed out vanilla JavaScript replacements from jQuery’s most popular features. Here are some examples.</p>



<ul id="draft_check_box_list_0"><li>Selecting DOM elements using the # or . notation:&nbsp;<code>document.querySelector('.button')</code></li><li>Waiting for page DOM to load:&nbsp;<code>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () =&gt; { ... })</code></li><li>Executing AJAX requests:&nbsp;<code>fetch('/api.json').then(response =&gt; response.text()).then(body =&gt; console.log(body))</code></li></ul>



<p>If developers create a new web application in 2020, jQuery will&nbsp;probably no longer be necessary. The web has finally evolved beyond jQuery.</p>



<p>Another benefit of dropping IE is that Bootstrap 5 supports CSS custom properties. They make CSS more flexible and even programmable. For some examples, check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://v5.getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/content/tables/#how-do-the-variants-and-accented-tables-work">docs on how to style tables</a>&nbsp;in Bootstrap 5.</p>



<p>Besides dropping jQuery, Bootstrap 5 also brings some notable features. Bootstrap 5 has an updated UI look and feel to focus more on-page content. It has a redesigned and better-looking set of custom form controls. It also has a new logo and&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/06/26/bootstrap-icons-alpha5/">300+ additional icons</a>. For web sites that make heavy use of icons, the new SVG sprite allows developers to load all icons in a single SVG file and then use them as needed. That will likely increase web site performance and improve HTML readability.</p>



<p>The Bootstrap framework is open-source software available under the MIT license. Submitting bugs and fixes of&nbsp;<a href="https://v5.getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 5 alpha</a>&nbsp;to the team via its&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/twbs">GitHub repo</a>&nbsp;are welcomed.</p>

<p>Pop quiz: Apart from being tech companies, what do Amazon, Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, Spotify, Kickstarter, Indiegogo, DoorDash, Postmates, and TaskRabbit all have in common?</p>



<p>Answer: They all use&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stripe</a>&nbsp;to process payments.</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0drift0ho9g7wbfexi.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-stripe-grew-images.001.jpeg" alt="How Stripe Grew"></figure>



<p>While it might not be a household name (yet), Stripe has quietly been taking over the world of online payments. In fact, if you’re reading this post, there’s a good chance you’ve already made a purchase via Stripe (even if you didn’t know it).</p>



<p>In the past year,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/jdewitt29/status/1050017508516876289" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">84%</a>&nbsp;of U.S. adults purchased something via Stripe. And when you consider that there are now more than&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/us/customers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a million</a>&nbsp;businesses using Stripe to process payments, it’s easy to see how that 84% figure became a reality.</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0drift0ho9g7wbfexi.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-stripe-grew-images.002.jpeg" alt="How Stripe grew"></figure>



<p>Of course, Stripe’s success didn’t happen overnight. The company’s co-founders, brothers Patrick Collison and John Collison, started the company in 2010 after dropping out of college and receiving a seed investment from Y Combinator (the startup accelerator program). And while older brother Patrick, Stripe’s CEO, was 21-years-old when they founded Stripe, and younger brother John, Stripe’s president, was 19, this wasn’t their first rodeo. They sold a previous company, Auctomatic, for $5 million in 2008, back when Patrick was 19 and John was just 17.</p>



<p>Flash forward to 2018 and Patrick and John Collison are two of the youngest billionaires in the world. After raising $245 million in September of 2018, their company Stripe is now valued at $20 billion – 4,000x more than what their first company had been worth.</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0drift0ho9g7wbfexi.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-stripe-grew-images.003.jpeg" alt="Stripe valuation"></figure>



<p>When you look at this incredible level of&nbsp;hypergrowth&nbsp;that Stripe has been able to achieve, it begs the obvious question:</p>



<p><strong>How the heck did they do it?</strong></p>



<p>In this post, we’ll dive deep into how Stripe was able to go from $0 to $20 billion in less than a decade. Ultimately, there are four key lessons all companies can benefit from implementing:</p>



<ol><li>Solve a real problem.</li><li>Obsess over customer experience.</li><li>Have a vision for the future.</li><li>Read books…lots of books.</li></ol>



<h2>1) Solve a real problem.</h2>



<p><strong>☝️ That’s how Stripe generated word-of-mouth around their new product.</strong></p>



<p>When the Collisons launched their first company, Auctomatic, back in 2007, they came to an unexpected realization. They realized that the hardest part of starting an online business wasn’t coming up with an idea, or coding that idea into reality, or marketing that idea to potential customers. Instead, as John explained in an interview with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/stripe-payments-apple-amazon-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired</a>, “The hardest part was finding a way to accept customers’ money.”</p>



<p>At the time, the largest eCommerce companies invested in building their own systems for processing payments online. But for scrappy startups (like Auctomatic), this wasn’t a viable solution. Doing so was too expensive and required weeks of back-and-forth with the bank. So instead, many of those startups turned to PayPal, which promised to make accepting online payments easier. Only…it didn’t. To the Collisons, PayPal still felt unnecessarily clunky and complex, and it came with too many regulations and setup fees. For developers who wanted to get payments up-and-running on a website quickly and easily, there was still no solution on the market.&nbsp;<strong>At a time when every other aspect of starting an online business had become easier, accepting payments remained complicated.</strong></p>



<p>And that’s how the idea for&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/press" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stripe</a>&nbsp;– “a developer-focused, instant-setup payment platform that [can] scale to any size” – was born. As John told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1813087/inside-stripe-paypal-competitor-backed-paypal-founders-peter-thiel-elon-musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fast Company</a>, “Stripe really did come about because we were really appalled by how hard it was to charge for things online.”</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0drift0ho9g7wbfexi.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-stripe-grew-images.004.jpeg" alt="Josh Collison Stripe"></figure>



<p>In 2011, the year the Collisons officially launched Stripe, they visited PayPal co-founders Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and told them, in a nutshell, that PayPal was outdated and broken. Then, the Collisons asked them for money…and got it. Recognizing the issues the Collisons saw with the current online payments infrastructure were legitimate, Thiel and Musk led Stripe’s $2 million Series A round of fundraising that same year alongside Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz.</p>



<p>Talk about a gutsy move. As John told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/stripe-payments-apple-amazon-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired</a>, “It’s a little impetuous to go to PayPal founders and say payments on the internet are totally broken. But look, you can WhatsApp anyone around the world and it’s free. It’s a remarkable act of coordination between the telcos and ISPs and the people who own the fiber underneath the sea to create this global communications network. Then, if you look at the economic infrastructure, we haven’t even started.”</p>



<p>The Collison brothers didn’t set out to revolutionize the world of online payments processing when they founded Stripe. Instead, they set out to solve the legitimate problem they faced as developers and entrepreneurs. And, as it turns out, they weren’t alone. Fellow developers and entrepreneurs who were part of the same accelerator program (remember Y Combinator) were experiencing the same problem and soon began adopting Stripe in droves – and they began telling their friends about it.</p>



<p>For the first couple of years, word of mouth among developers was the lifeblood of Stripe’s business. As Patrick explained in an interview with&nbsp;<a href="http://techzinglive.com/page/939/168-tz-interview-patrick-collison-stripe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TechZing</a>, “Initially it very much spread through a word of mouth process. That was surprising to us because it’s a payment system not a social network so it’s not something you’d think would have any virality whatsoever. But it became clear that everything else was so bad and so painful to work with that people actually were selling this to their friends.”</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0drift0ho9g7wbfexi.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-stripe-grew-images.005.jpeg" alt="Patrick Collison Stripe"></figure>



<p>It’s clear that the spark that got Stripe’s growth started was identifying a legitimate problem that resonated with lots of people. But in order to maintain the word of mouth that accompanied Stripe’s launch, and in order to keep that word of mouth positive, Stripe couldn’t simply rest on its laurels: It needed to invest in delivering a stellar customer experience, both for its own customers and for its customers’ customers.</p>



<h2><a href="https://www.drift.com/summit/revgrowth-virtual-experiences/"></a>2) Obsess over customer experience.</h2>



<p><strong>☝️ That’s how Stripe attracted its biggest accounts, like Lyft.</strong></p>



<p>Developers who switch from legacy payments processing systems to Stripe notice the difference in experience&nbsp;<em>immediately</em>. For starters, installing Stripe on a website or in an app requires copying and pasting just seven lines of code – that’s it! A process that once took weeks can now happen in a single day.</p>



<p>As John explained in an interview with NPR, “We have lots of stories of people integrating payments in an afternoon or an evening and then launching their business the next day. And that just worked consistently.”</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0drift0ho9g7wbfexi.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-stripe-grew-images.006.jpeg" alt="Josh Collison Stripe"></figure>



<p>Of course, that installation experience is essential to what makes Stripe such an effective product. As you read in the previous section, developers had been longing for a payments solution they could quickly and easily plug into their own products, and Stripe delivered.</p>



<p>In addition to making their installation process a breeze, Stripe made their entire end-to-end customer experience as enjoyable as possible. For example, Stripe’s documentation is famously clear and concise, which makes it easy for developers to find answers to any questions they might have. Stripe also regularly hosts meetups, hackathons, and other events where developers can talk about their experiences with Stripe and share best practices.</p>



<p>Stripe did such a good job of building goodwill around its brand that when it started sending out welcome packages to new customers, which included Stripe-branded stickers and t-shirts,&nbsp;<em>developers actually wore those t-shirts</em>. As Facebook product manager Morgan Brown wrote in a&nbsp;<a href="https://growthhackers.com/growth-studies/how-stripe-marketed-to-developers-so-effectively" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Growth Hackers</a>&nbsp;article, the Stripe swag “only fueled the positive vibes developers had of the company. These t-shirts were worn proudly and the care packages shared on social media, mostly from developer recipients to other developers who they were connected to online.”</p>



<p>And while it’s easy to see how Stripe’s focus on customer experience helped the service become even more popular among developers, we’re still only looking at one half of the Stripe experience. Because in addition to reimagining the way sellers accepted payments online, Stripe also reimagined the way buyers pay for things online. In other words, Stripe isn’t just concerned about the experiences its customers have, it’s also concerned about the experiences its customers’ customers have.</p>



<p>Unlike its predecessor, Paypal, Stripe doesn’t insert itself into the buying process. Instead, it works behind the scenes, which means buyers never have to leave a company’s checkout page or enter some third-party-branded workflow in order to complete a transaction. When you buy something from a company via Stripe, Stripe gets out of the way and does its job in the background. It’s seamless – there are no interruptions.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, as a seller, using Stripe means you get to maintain a one-to-one connection with your buyer. As Stripe’s Chief Business Officer, Bill Alvarado, told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1813087/inside-stripe-paypal-competitor-backed-paypal-founders-peter-thiel-elon-musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fast Company</a>&nbsp;back in 2012: “You look at Google Checkout, you look at PayPal – they get in the way of the product. In many ways, Google and PayPal are trying to create their own relationship with your customer. I think that’s the thing that Stripe has done right. We’ve designed this for fast use, yes, but also so that you can retain control of your experience, your product, and your customers.”</p>



<p>It’s this dedication to customer experience that led to Stripe win deals with major companies, like Facebook, Google, Slack, Salesforce.com, Shopify, Target, OpenTable, Yelp, and Lyft. Case in point: When the Collison brothers were asked in an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=608512576" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NPR</a>&nbsp;interview how Stripe was able to get a company like Lyft’s attention, John responded that the fundamental and most important thing was that Stripe “enabled product experiences that they wanted to have.”</p>



<p>Specifically, with Lyft, the ride-sharing service needed a system that allowed them to both charge their customers&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;pay their drivers – something that didn’t exist yet.</p>

As powerful as it is, it is generally  taught at the pre-college level without much consideration on its<strong> underlying theory</strong> or its <strong>alternatives</strong>…</p><p>In this guide though, we’ll take a look at both of those, and delve into the different types of <strong>division procedures</strong> under the different scenarios. We’ll also try to illustrate their role in promoting a holistic understanding about division and numbers in general — through candid analysis and a wide range of examples.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Long-Division-Guide-for-Integers-Logo.png" alt="Definitive Higher Math Guide on Long Division for Integers — Logo" width="850" height="283" title="Long Division Guide for Integers Logo"></figure></div><p>(By the way, are you fairly acquainted with the content of this guide? If so, you might find this comprehensive <strong>summary worksheet</strong> both challenging and useful.)</p><span> </span><h2 id="terms"><span id="Euclidean_Division_%E2%80%94_Terminology"></span><a href="#toc">Euclidean Division — Terminology</a><span></span></h2><p> In arithmetic, we often like to express a number $n$ as chunks of another (non-zero) number $d$.  When that happens, we’re said to be dividing $n$ by $d$, where $n$ is known as the <strong>dividend</strong>, and $d$ the<strong> divisor.</strong></p><p> In general, given a dividend $n$ and a divisor $d$, we can express $n$ as $dq + r$ for some <em>integer</em> $q$ and some number $r$, and while $n$ can have many <strong>$dq+r$ representations</strong>, there is only one such representation where $ 0\le r &lt; |d|$.</p><p>In particular, in the case where the dividend and the divisor are <em>integers</em>, this result is known as the <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Division Theorem (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_division#Statement_of_the_theorem" target="_blank">Division Theorem</a></strong>, but even if they are not, the following still apply in general:</p><ul><li>$q$ — which is the unique <em>integer</em> in the above $dq+r$ representation — is known as the <strong>quotient</strong>.</li><li>$r$  — which is the unique number in the above $dq+r$ representation — is known as the <strong>remainder</strong>.</li><li>The act of finding those two numbers is called an <strong>Euclidean division</strong>, or more colloquially, <em>division with remainder</em>.</li></ul><div><p>In Case You’re Wondering…</p><p>The Division Theorem for integers is generally established by relying on the <strong>Well-Ordering Principle</strong>. For the general case, the <strong><a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Archimedean_Principle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Archimedean Property for real numbers</a> </strong>might be of help.</p></div><p>So what’s being implied here is that the dividend and the divisor are generally fixed numbers, while the <strong>interim quotients</strong>/<strong>remainders</strong> can change depending on the stage of the division we’re in. Furthermore:</p><ul><li>The equation $n=dq+r$ is known as the <strong>algebraic representation</strong> of the division.</li><li> The equation $\displaystyle \frac{n}{d} = q + \frac{r}{d}$ is known as the <strong>fractional representation</strong> of the division.</li></ul><p>(to be sure, there’s also the <strong>mixed fraction</strong> $\displaystyle q \, \frac{r}{d}$, though such notations are generally more prone to confusion when we move beyond the integers.)</p><p>And of course, there’s also the <strong>graphical representations</strong> of the division as well — which we’ll get into after some preliminary theory on division procedure.</p><h2 id="edptheory"><span id="Euclidean_Division_Procedure_%E2%80%94_Theory"></span><a href="#toc">Euclidean Division Procedure — Theory</a><span></span></h2><p> Of course, the Division Theorem is a neat piece of logic guaranteeing that in an Euclidean division scenario, the <strong>quotient</strong> and the <strong>remainder </strong>exist and are unique. However, it doesn’t offer us much clue as to how we should go about finding those numbers in practice…</p><p> But then, that’s precisely where the primary topic of our interest — <strong>Euclidean division procedure </strong> — comes into play.</p><p> In a nutshell, these are the finite, recursive procedures that seek to find the quotient and the remainder through <strong>iterated subtractions</strong>. They tend to operate by deducting the dividend repeatedly — usually in a series of <em>leaps</em> — until it becomes smaller than the divisor itself.</p><p>And when that happens, the process comes to an end — with the <strong>last interim quotient </strong>and <strong>remainder</strong> being the answers to the original Euclidean division.</p><p>Or more specifically:</p><ol><li>Given a dividend $n$ and a (non-zero) divisor $d$, we would begin the procedure by <strong>deducting</strong> $n$ (or its absolute value) by $d$ — an integer number of times (say $q_1$). This would lead to an interim remainder $r_1$, and the following interim algebraic representation of the division: \[ <br>n = d q_1 + r_1 \]</li><li> At this point, if $0 \le r_1 &lt; |d|$, then the division procedure is finished. If not, we would continue with the <strong>same process</strong> by deducting $r_1$ (or its absolute value) by $d$ — another integer number of times (say $q_2$). This would lead to the next interim remainder $r_2$, and the next algebraic representation of the division:  \[ n = d q_1 + d q_2 + r_2 \]</li><li> So as we go through the <strong>$i^{\text{th}}$ iteration</strong> of the division, we would obtain:<ul><li> The <strong>$i^{\text{th}}$-stage quotient </strong>$q_i$</li><li> The <strong>interim quotient</strong> $q_1 + \cdots + q_i$</li><li> The <strong>interim remainder</strong> $r_i$</li></ul></li><li> And if we choose the stage quotients judiciously so that the $|r_i|$ decreases by, say, at least $1$ at each stage, then after a <em>finite</em> number of iterations (say $m$), we’d be guaranteed to generate an <strong>interim remainder</strong> $r_m$ such that $0 \le r_m &lt; |d|$. And when that happens, our final algebraic representation would become: \begin{align*} <br>n &amp; = dq_1 + \cdots + dq_m + r_m \\ &amp; = d (q_1 + \cdots +q_m) + r_m  \end{align*} At which point, the division procedure would come to an end, yielding $q_1 + \cdots + q_m$ and $r_m$ as the <strong>quotient</strong> and the <strong>remainder</strong> of $n \div d$, respectively.</li></ol><p>Here, notice that whether $n$ and $d$ are integers or not, the interim quotients must be always kept as <strong>integers</strong> — and are the only ones among the $n$, $d$, $q$s, $r$s that must satisfy that requirement.</p><p>For this guide though, we’ll restrict ourselves to the cases where both $n$ and $d$ are integers, and look at the division methods and approaches that come out of those. These include the <strong>long/short division methods</strong>, the <strong> chunking methods,</strong> the <strong>freeform method </strong>— among other less graphical division approaches.</p><h2><span id="Integer_Division"></span><a href="#toc">Integer Division</a><span></span></h2><p>Since the concept of division has its basis on the natural numbers, it makes sense that we first start from there and illustrate some of the <strong>primary methods</strong> being involved. Once there, we’ll slowly expand our toolset with other alternate methods and approaches — so that other scenarios of integer divisions can be included as well.</p><h3><span id="Case_1_%E2%80%94_DigitBased_Methods"></span><a href="#toc">Case 1 — Digit-Based Methods</a><span></span></h3><p> If you have a tape that’s<strong> 1529 cm</strong> long and you want to cut it down into pieces of <strong>7cm chunks</strong>, how many of those pieces can you make? And after all is said and done, how much of the tape would remain?</p><p> Well, as you might guess, this is nothing more than the following <strong>division problem</strong>: \[ 7 \enclose{longdiv}{1529} \] which can be solved by using the traditional <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="long division method (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_division" target="_blank">long division method</a></strong>, or — if we prefer — the abbreviated <strong>short division method</strong> as well.</p><h4><span id="Long_Division"></span><a href="#toc">Long Division</a><span></span></h4><p>As you might already know, the long division procedure consists in setting up the division tableaus so that at each stage, we would be cranking out a digit of the <strong>quotient</strong> — by deducting the dividend/interim remainder by the largest number of times possible.</p><p>In this case for example, since $1529$ can be deducted by $7$ $100$ times, but not $1000$ times, we know that we should begin the process by looking into the <strong>digit-multiples</strong> of $100$.</p><p>In fact, a bit of inspection would show that $1529$ can be deducted by $7$ $200$ times, but not $300$ times. This would lead us to choose $200$ as our first <strong>stage quotient</strong>, which would in turn produce the following tableau: \begin{array}{r} 200 \\[-0.35em] 7 \enclose{longdiv}{1529}\kern{-0.15ex} <br>\\[-0.3em]   \underline{1400} <br>\\[-0.25em]   129  \end{array} And here is the beauty about this approach: since we’ve already established that $1529$ can be deducted by $7$ $200$ times, but not $300$ times, this means that we definitely won’t be further deducting $1529$ by $100$ times or more, and that all that remains is to focus at the <strong>digit-multiples</strong> of $10$ instead.</p><p>In fact, a little bit of inspection would show that $129$ — what remains now of $1529$ — can be deducted by $7$ $10$ times, but not $20$ times. This would lead us to choose $10$ as the next <strong>stage quotient</strong>, which in turn would lead to the following tableau:  \begin{array}{r} 10 \\[-0.35em] 200 \\[-0.35em] 7 \enclose{longdiv}{1529}\kern{-0.15ex} <br>\\[-0.3em]   \underline{1400} <br>\\[-0.25em]   129 \\[-0.3em] \underline{\phantom{1}70} <br>\\[-0.25em] 59 \end{array} As you can see here, our notation is a bit unusual in that the numbers are being stacked up at the <strong>extremes</strong>, but those are there for a few reasons — which will become clearer in the next few sections.</p><p>But that aside, notice that since we’ve already established that what remained of $1529$ could be deducted by $7$ $10$ times, but not $20$ times, this means that we’ll definitely not be further deducting it by $10$ times or more — and that a deduction by a <strong>digit-multiple</strong> of $1$ should be our next step.</p><p>In fact, it doesn’t take a long time to realize that $59$ — what remains now of $1529$ — can be deducted by $7$ $8$ times, but not $9$ times. This would lead us to choose $8$ as our next <strong>stage quotient</strong>, which in turn would lead us to our next tableau: <br>\begin{array}{r} 8 \\[-0.35em] 10 \\[-0.35em] 200 \\[-0.35em] 7 \enclose{longdiv}{1529}\kern{-0.15ex} <br>\\[-0.3em]   \underline{1400} <br>\\[-0.25em]   129 \\[-0.3em] \underline{\phantom{1}70} <br>\\[-0.25em] 59 \\[-0.3em] \underline{56} \\[-0.25em] 3 \end{array} Here, notice that since we’ve already established that what remained of $1529$ could be deducted $8$ times, but not $9$ times, it already followed by then that what <em>would</em> remain of $1529$ must be smaller than the <strong>divisor</strong> itself. In fact, this is reflected in our last tableau as well.</p><p>But either way, the division procedure is now coming to its end, yielding $200 + 10 + 8 = 218$ as the quotient, $3$ as the remainder, and the following <strong>representations</strong> of the division as well:</p><ul><li><strong>Algebraic representation</strong>:  $1529 = 7 (218) + 3$</li><li><strong>Fractional representation</strong>: $\displaystyle \frac{1529}{7} = 218 + \frac{3}{7}$</li></ul><h4><span id="Long_Division_Shorthands_%E2%80%94_Quotient_Merging_and_Omissions_of_Zeros"></span><a href="#toc">Long Division Shorthands — Quotient Merging and Omissions of Zeros</a><span></span></h4><p>Now, in the above example, there are two interesting peculiarities. The first one — which is easier to spot — is the fact that each stage quotient takes the form of a <strong>leading digit</strong> followed by zeros (or no zero), with the place of the leading digit moving to the right at each stage — <em>without ever overlapping</em>.</p><p>So the natural question becomes: “Does this apply to all long division tableaus at every stage?” Fortunately, the …</p></section></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <p>It’s time for another Gleam release! This time as well as taking a look at
what’s new in the compiler, we’re going to take a look at what’s new in the
wider Gleam ecosystem too.</p>

<h2 id="record-update-syntax">Record update syntax</h2>

<p>Previously when we wanted to update some of the fields on the record we would
need to create a new instance and manually copy across the fields that have
not changed.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>level_up</span><span>(</span><span>pokemon</span><span>:</span> <span>Pokemon</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>new_level</span> <span>=</span> <span>pokemon</span><span>.level</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>new_moves</span> <span>=</span> <span>moves_for</span><span>(</span><span>pokemon</span><span>.species</span><span>,</span> <span>new_level</span><span>)</span>
  <span>Pokemon</span><span>(</span>
    <span>level</span><span>:</span> <span>new_level</span><span>,</span>
    <span>moves</span><span>:</span> <span>new_moves</span><span>,</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>pokemon</span><span>.name</span><span>,</span>
    <span>species</span><span>:</span> <span>pokemon</span><span>.species</span><span>,</span>
    <span>item</span><span>:</span> <span>pokemon</span><span>.item</span><span>,</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is quite verbose! Worse, it’s error prone and annoying to type every
time.</p>

<p>To remedy this problem <a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton">Quinn Wilton</a> has
added the record update syntax to Gleam, so now we only need to specify the
fields that change.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>level_up</span><span>(</span><span>pokemon</span><span>:</span> <span>Pokemon</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>new_level</span> <span>=</span> <span>pokemon</span><span>.level</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>new_moves</span> <span>=</span> <span>moves_for</span><span>(</span><span>pokemon</span><span>.species</span><span>,</span> <span>new_level</span><span>)</span>
  <span>Pokemon</span><span>(</span><span>..</span><span>pokemon</span><span>,</span> <span>level</span><span>:</span> <span>new_level</span><span>,</span> <span>moves</span><span>:</span> <span>new_moves</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All data in Gleam is immutable, so this syntax does not alter the values of
the existing record, instead it creates a new record with the original values
and the updated values.</p>

<h2 id="numbers">Numbers</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tomwhatmore">Tom Whatmore</a> has added some new features to
Gleam’s numbers.</p>

<p>There’s now syntaxes for binary, octal, and hexadecimal int literals.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// 4 ways of writing the int 15</span>
<span>let</span> <span>hexadecimal</span> <span>=</span> <span>0xF</span>
<span>let</span> <span>decimal</span> <span>=</span> <span>15</span>
<span>let</span> <span>octal</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>o17</span>
<span>let</span> <span>binary</span> <span>=</span> <span>0b00001111</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These might be handy in many situations such as when implementing
<a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton/gleam-chip8">a virtual machine</a> or <a href="https://github.com/lpil/tetromino">a game of tetris</a> in Gleam.</p>

<p>Underscores can now be added to numbers, making larger numbers easier to read.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>billion</span> <span>=</span> <span>1_000_000_000</span>
<span>let</span> <span>trillion_and_change</span> <span>=</span> <span>1_000_000_000_000</span><span>.</span><span>57</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="type-holes">Type holes</h2>

<p>Type holes can be used to give partial annotations to values.</p>

<p>Here we’re saying that <code>x</code> is a List, but we’re not saying what type the list
contains, leaving the compiler to infer it.</p>



<p>This may be useful when adding annotations for documentation or to use a more
restrictive type than would be inferred by the compiler, as you can leave out
any parts of the annotation that are not important to you there.</p>

<h2 id="compiler-improvements">Compiler improvements</h2>

<p>The majority of the compiler work in this release has been improvements to
existing features.</p>

<p>The formatter style has been improved in several ways, and the performance of
the formatter has been improved. One popular change is to how it formats
assignments that don’t fit on a single line.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Before</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>
  <span>tuple</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>,</span> <span>session</span><span>),</span>
<span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>application_registry</span><span>.get_session</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>.user_id</span><span>)</span>

<span>// Now</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>tuple</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>,</span> <span>session</span><span>))</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>application_registry</span><span>.get_session</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>.user_id</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Much better!</p>

<p>Additionally several error messages have been improved to include more
information on how to fix the problem, and a whole bunch of bug have been
squashed. Please see the
<a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a> for
more detail.</p>

<h2 id="http">HTTP</h2>

<p>Outside of the compiler the big new thing in Gleam is the first release of
<a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/http">Gleam HTTP</a>. Inspired by existing libraries such as Ruby’s Rack,
Elixir’s Raxx, and Haskell’s WAI, Gleam HTTP provides a single well-typed
interface for creating web applications and clients while keeping the
underlying HTTP client and server code modular.</p>

<p>In Gleam a HTTP service is a regular function that takes a HTTP request and
returns a HTTP response, where request and response are types defined by the
HTTP library.</p>

<h4 id="services">Services</h4>

<p>Here’s a simplistic service that echoes back any body sent to it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>{</span><span>Request</span><span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>echo_service</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>:</span> <span>Request</span><span>(</span><span>_</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>http</span><span>.response</span><span>(</span><span>200</span><span>)</span>
  <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>http</span><span>.set_resp_body</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>.body</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As a normal Gleam function it is easy to test this service, no special test
helpers or test server are required.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>should</span>
<span>import</span> <span>my_app</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>echo_test</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>response</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>http</span><span>.default_req</span><span>()</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>http</span><span>.set_req_body</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, world!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>my_app</span><span>.service</span>

  <span>response</span><span>.status</span>
  <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>should</span><span>.equal</span><span>(</span><span>200</span><span>)</span>

  <span>response</span><span>.body</span>
  <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>should</span><span>.equal</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, world!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Gleam’s HTTP library also provides middleware, which can be used to add
additional functionality to a HTTP service.</p>

<h4 id="running-a-service">Running a service</h4>

<p>Once we have defined a service we want to run the service with a web server so
that it can handle HTTP requests from the outside world. To do this we use a
HTTP server adapter, such as one for the <a href="https://github.com/elli-lib/elli">Elli Erlang web server</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>my_app</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>http</span><span>/</span><span>elli</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>start</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>elli</span><span>.start</span><span>(</span><span>my_app</span><span>.service</span><span>,</span> <span>on_port</span><span>:</span> <span>4000</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or one for the <a href="https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy">Cowboy Erlang web server</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>my_app</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>http</span><span>/</span><span>cowboy</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>start</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>cowboy</span><span>.start</span><span>(</span><span>my_app</span><span>.service</span><span>,</span> <span>on_port</span><span>:</span> <span>4000</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or even using the adapter for the <a href="https://github.com/elixir-plug/plug">Elixir’s Plug interface</a>, so that a
Gleam HTTP service can be mounted within an Elixir Phoenix web application.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyAppWeb</span><span>.</span><span>UserController</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> <span>MyAppWeb</span><span>,</span> <span>:controller</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>show</span><span>(</span><span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>params</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>conn</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>GleamPlug</span><span>.</span><span>call_service</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>:my_app</span><span>.</span><span>service</span><span>/</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A list of all available server adapters can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/http/#server-adapters">Gleam HTTP
project’s README</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like to see more examples of Gleam HTTP being used to create a
web application see the <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/example-echo-server">echo server</a> on GitHub. It
includes all the above as well as other concepts such as routing and logging.</p>

<h4 id="http-clients">HTTP clients</h4>

<p>HTTP services are only half the story! We also can use the HTTP library to
make out own requests.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>http</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>httpc</span>

  <span>try</span> <span>response</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>http</span><span>.default_req</span><span>()</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>http</span><span>.set_method</span><span>(</span><span>http</span><span>.Get</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>http</span><span>.set_host</span><span>(</span><span>"api.ipify.org"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>httpc</span><span>.send</span>
  <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>response</span><span>.body</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we’ve build a HTTP request and sent it using the <code>httpc</code> client adapter,
returning the response body if the request is successful.</p>

<p>A list of all available client adapters can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/http/#client-adapters">Gleam HTTP
project’s README</a>.</p>

I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed making it.

I am many things: Husband, Father, Designer, Developer, Entrepreneur, and Interior House Painter to name a few. My wife and I have been married since 2016 and have two boys (10 and 12). We live in Castle Rock Colorado, which is located about 30 minutes South of Denver. I am originally from Iowa, have lived in Minnesota, and of course now Colorado.</p><p>I have two degrees, one in design and another in 3D Animation. I have also studied computer science, photography, pottery, and grew up helping my dad build and remodel things. <em>(He is a carpenter/cabinet builder.)</em></p><p>In September of 2018, I stepped away from my design and development career and started my own interior house painting company which has continued to be extremely successful and continues to grow. In my free time, I focus on my own personal, digital products to relax and hopefully, one day will be my primary focus and revenue source.</p><h2 id="what-are-you-making">What are you making?</h2><p>As many people know, I make a lot of things, of which you can check out here: <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.krazier.com&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1598466186406000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0RVfOCL3YgTIhIkAVAXbe8">https://www.krazier.com</a> but the one I spend a lot of my time on and has been growing the fastest is Retrospect. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.retrospect.team&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1598466186406000&amp;usg=AOvVaw18nsSYhG0Y9pINGNtWMKO0">https://www.retrospect.team</a></p><p>Retrospect is a real-time collaboration tool for retrospectives, tasks, and ideas.</p><h2 id="how-did-the-idea-for-your-product-come-to-mind">How did the idea for your product come to mind?</h2><p>I was working for a company a couple of years ago and we needed a tool to do retrospectives and the existing solutions we found were not designed well and didnâ€™t work all that great, not to mention the bigger solutions costing a lot of money to use for a relatively small need that we had. I set out to build a simple, affordable solution that looked good too.</p><h2 id="what-inspired-you-to-make-your-product">What inspired you to make your product?</h2><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wmkyhgs67HaZAalvciwqT6cj56V3OKmQQdK9SojC05r4XwoelQxx7YjFCk3t_Hst_HHV7-yXuXpD8FqWziizHUeAMW6T-BTTbfeGwVC8m2p-iNoaXEsFipWMuIoytQ"><figcaption>Retrospect.</figcaption></figure><p>As mentioned above, it was originally out of necessity, but it is become a bit of a passion project to see just how far I can take it. With the Covid19 lockdown situation, this type of tool has only become more important for businesses to take advantage of.</p><p>Retrospect is purposefully â€œsimpleâ€�, we did not set out to make another Trello or Asana type of tool. Those tools are great and are a nice compliment to what we are building. One important focus for us has been â€œanonymityâ€� in the product. With Retrospectives, it is important to be able to provide critical feedback, it can be hard to do that if there is the potential for your co-workers to get upset with something you may have said. With Retrospect, everything you publish to a board is kept anonymous so that you can give that critical feedback without fear of retaliation.</p><p>Retrospect will always be affordable; we want this service to be approachable to as many people as possible while still being worth our time financially. We provide great pricing and a great solution and hope people will recognize that and find value in what we offer.</p><blockquote>I make because it is fun, I make because I know how, I love the challenge, the risk, and the huge potential it offers.</blockquote><h2 id="why-embark-on-the-maker-s-journey">Why embark on the makerâ€™s journey?</h2><p>I have always enjoyed building things, from Legos and plastic models to do-it-yourself projects around the house and of course digital designs and products. We live in a world that is very digital and very accessible for anyone to learn to design or code their own software. With tools like Makerlog, we can now share our progress, connect with other makers, and build things together. By nature, building software is often an â€œindividualâ€� thing to do, so having resources to connect with others makes the journey a lot more fun and open to learning from so many types of people.</p><p>A lot of people have a bit of an ambition to make something, whether it is art, electronics, gardening, woodworking, jewelry, or software. It is a way for us to get away from the day-to-day requirements in our lives and focus on something that we love to do without the stress of having to do it for anyone else. I make because it is fun, I make because I know how, I love the challenge, the risk, and the huge potential it offers.</p><h2 id="how-do-you-see-the-future-of-your-product">How do you see the future of your product?</h2><p>Retrospect has come a long way since the initial launch about two years ago, we have provided more permissions, more functionality, and improved the experience. The future has a lot of potential for new features and growth.</p><p>With the number of projects, I work on, I tend to push out a lot of smaller updates rather than huge feature releases. It is easier for us to manage and it also does not overwhelm our uses with huge UI changes that might make the tool unexpectedly harder for them to use.</p><p>As we continue to push out updates, our user audience will continue to expand. At first, our focus was on â€œretrospectivesâ€� which mostly development teams would find value in, the average person does not need a retrospective tool in their day-to-day lives. We are working towards making this a tool that has a useful impact on a daily level both professionally and personally. This means new types of functionality and a refreshed focus on our marketing and branding. Some of which will be happing over the coming weeks.</p><h2 id="as-of-today-what-are-your-stats">As of today, what are your stats?</h2><p>As of today, our stats areâ€¦</p><ul><li><strong>Users:</strong> 6,290</li><li><strong>Boards:</strong> 3,925</li><li><strong>Cards:</strong> 48,947</li><li><strong>Monthly Pageviews:</strong> 10K+</li><li><strong>Revenue:</strong> $2K+ (We will be switching to a subscription model soon.)</li></ul><h2 id="how-do-you-use-makerlog">How do you use Makerlog?</h2><p>I post my daily updates but try to focus on important tasks rather than â€œI had a coffee todayâ€�, I do not want to spam the feed with things that are not important to know. I read most of the discussions and contribute when it makes sense.</p><p>I love Makerlog because it has allowed me to meet so many people that I never would have met any other way (other than maybe through Twitter). I feel like I have some lifelong friends despite having never met anyone in person, yet.</p><blockquote>I love Makerlog because it has allowed me to meet so many people that I never would have met any other way (other than maybe through Twitter).</blockquote><h2 id="what-are-the-biggest-challenges-of-being-a-maker">What are the biggest challenges of being a maker?</h2><p>The life of a maker is basically learning to deal with challenges daily, things you never would have thought you have to deal with. The bigger, more obvious challenges are lack of motivation, lack of revenue, and plain old fear.</p><p>Motivation, as makers we are by default motivated to work on things, that is what makes us a maker in the first place. The challenge comes into play when you have been working on something for a long time and it just feels like it will never be completed. There is always that â€œone more thingâ€� to do, person to reach out to, reason not to go live. When you do almost everything yourself, you simply get exhausted and lack of motivation is inevitable. Iâ€™m not sure itâ€™s a bad thing, it just means you need to learn how to renew that motivation to push forward. For me I like to go to or watch movies, it is one easy way for me to reset my mind and get back into thigs. I also like to clean my desk or house, make a list of every task I have, and then work through the easy ones as fast as possible since lack of motivation often comes from knowing you should be doing something else so you end up doing nothing at all. If you can get the easy things done, then it helps you get motivated again.</p><p>Lack of revenue, this is a devastating challenge to a lot of people. We often see those â€œovernight successâ€� stories, that usually are not overnight. Though, these days we are seeing a lot of people who will literally build something one day and have a lot of success the next, the question is how long-term is that success? The obvious goal of being a maker is to generate revenue so you can get away from that 9-5 job, the unobvious issue is that it can take years to get enough revenue to do that. A lot of people do not realize this fact and give up too early and go back to what they were doing before. We also canâ€™t â€œdo it allâ€� so we often have to hire some pieces out, if you have no revenue, this becomes a big burden and can literally prevent you from even finishing your project.</p><p>Fear, people have a lot of fear in their minds. It is an important thing to be aware of and work on as being maker means dealing with a lot of unknowns. Fear is a good motivator though; it can force you to learn something faster than you thought possible. When I first started launching products, I was scared to death. Now that I have launched so many projects, I barely stress out at all. It just comes with practice and experience to get over or at least manage your fears.</p><p>You are likely not able to cause too much damage with something you build, so go out and build something, launch it, and learn from it. The more you do it, the more interesting it becomes.</p><blockquote>The more you fail the more you learn.</blockquote><h2 id="managing-so-many-projects-how">Managing so many projects, how?</h2><p>As of right now, I have 11 public projects plus my day job, plus several new projects I am working on and my #MakerMillion journey. It looks like a lot, it is a lot, but it is not as crazy as it sounds.</p><p>Retrospect is my primary focus; I spend the most time on this project compared to any other one I have (outside of my day job). Everything else sort of just â€œruns itselfâ€�, I have very little time commitment reserved for them on a day-to-day basis. Yes, I work on them, but it is not a constant, urgent requirement. Some things I have not hardly touched in months, partly because I am focused on other things and partly because I just lose interest in them for a while.</p><p>I work in cycles and sprints, I will come up with a feature idea, work hard on it for a week or two, launch it and then move onto the next thing. I do this over and over across all my projects. If I tried to focus on one thing, for a long time, I would get super bored with it, I like having the ability to jump around. This approach very likely prevents me …</p></div></div>

August 28, 2020 | https://labcodes.com.br/blog/articles/writing-labels.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://labcodes.com.br/blog/articles/writing-labels.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>It has been a very productive and interesting journey creating Labcodes’ design system: there are always challenges and something new to learn. One thing we are doing is making sure we have our research and study references documented, alongside with the team's design choices, so we can have consistency throughout the components, and, mainly, a unison connection with our design principles. </p>
<p>One topic that always finds a way to catch my attention is the user interface short texts, and I was responsible, in our design system project, for the conception of the notifications, buttons and dropdown menu components. In common, they require guidelines and rules for writing its labels, in case of menu and buttons, and longer messages, for banners and toasts.</p>
<p>I remember that a long time ago, in the first versions of a mobile application that I don't remember which one, I read somewhere on the internet (sorry for the lack of references) about a change made to the interface: the term “my library” was set to “your library ”. OK! But what's interesting about that?</p>
<p>It was at that moment that the software began to communicate directly with its users. In the example, instead of considering the library as belonging to the system, the system now reports that the library belongs to the user. This change shows how short texts details change the reader's perception of a product. Below I will return to this subject.</p>
<h2>Writing labels</h2>
<p>Labels are commands applied to interface elements such as menus, tags, buttons, text inputs and other interface elements. They directly address users by communicating something or requesting an action. These commands are associated with interactive flows, normally change the system's state, and must be brief, informative and extremely clear. (<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ui-copy/">adapted from n/n group</a>)</p>
<p><em>Each company has its own brand guide, which should present the tone and voices that the organization’s written communication should have. You can use it as a basis for writing according to how your company does it. Applying these rules, as well as other good writing practices, are a great path for good results. Here at Labcodes we have our own writing guide, which helps us a lot.</em></p>
<p>Following this reasoning, our design system's buttons have labels that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must communicate exactly what will happen when the user interacts with this component.</li>
<li>Only the first letter of the label's sentence is capitalized, as well as any other specific noun that requires capitalization.</li>
<li>They are as short as possible, preferably with a maximum of 3 words.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As difficult as it is to reduce actions labels to just 3 words, we chose to keep this rule as a </em>challenge in order to train our synthesis skills and communicate what really matters.*</p>
<p>For action menus we use some specific rules, but they are also applicable to buttons and other label categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use verbs and imperative phrases to describes the action triggered by the interaction. Never use verbs alone, always alongside a noun. For example: “Move item”, “Edit description”, “Get help". </li>
<li>Use nouns for actions that navigates to other pages (navigation actions/links). For example: “Keyboard shortcuts”, “Profile editor", “System settings”.</li>
<li>Don't use articles. They can complexify something that is simpler, increasing the length of a line, in addition to generating other unwanted effects. For example: write “Add bookmark” instead of “Add a bookmark”.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Let's take a step back to when I mentioned how short texts can change the perception of a product. Be aware when labeling system or user's owned items. A good example is to write “Your settings” instead of “My settings” since we are talking about user's preferences, that, even being stored by the system, they are still personal choices. This very naming choice shows attention to detail by making explicit product core values and showing who is in charge.</em></p>
<p><em>The dialogue between the system and its users must be direct, clear and friendly. When writing texts for interfaces, imagine the system as an experienced technical person talking to a non-technical person who needs to know what to do next, explaining a question in an understandable way, without making the experience dense or scary.</em></p>
<p>Something important to consider when writing button labels is the use of terms such as "Ok", "Yes", "No", "Finish", which does not have an explicit meaning for its triggered actions. It may be nice to spell out the actions that will be performed as the use of generic terms can cause difficulties in understanding or lead the user to take an action that they will regret.  </p>
<p>Most users typically press buttons or select actions without paying much attention to what they are doing. To avoid these inconveniences, in potentially destructive actions or that could cause an error, always provide a way to undo the action and use clear labels that help the user to recognize the options of "Undo", "Cancel", "Interrupt". In some cases, it may be useful to add a second confirmation layer to avoid data loss.</p>
<p><em>In common cases, there is simply not enough space in an application to accommodate commands with long labels, so, just repeating here the reminder to keep everything very simple. Consider it as a mantra and always ask yourself if it can be simplified further without losing clarity. Give preference to labels with only one line of text that contain up to 4 words.</em></p>
<h2>The design model for user interface texts</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/uxguide/text-ui#a-design-model-for-ui-text">Microsoft has very interesting material on a design model for interface texts:</a></p>
<p>“As you think about UI text and its placement on your UI surfaces, consider these facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>During focused, immersive reading, people read in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom order (in Western cultures).</li>
<li>When using software, users aren't immersed in the UI itself but in their work. Consequently, users don't read UI text, they scan it.</li>
<li>When scanning a window, users may appear to be reading text when in reality they are filtering it. They often don't truly comprehend the UI text unless they perceive the need to.</li>
<li>Within a window, different UI elements receive different levels of attention. Users tend to read control labels first, especially those that appear relevant to completing the task at hand. By contrast, users tend to read static text only when they think they need to.”</li>
</ul>
<p>“For a general design model, don't assume that users carefully read the text in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom order. Rather, assume that users start by quickly scanning the whole window, then read UI text in roughly the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interactive controls in the center</li>
<li>The commit buttons</li>
<li>Interactive controls found elsewhere</li>
<li>Main instruction</li>
<li>Supplemental explanations</li>
<li>Window title</li>
<li>Other static text in main body</li>
<li>Footnotes”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You should also assume that, once users decide what to do, they immediately stop reading any text and take action.</strong></p>
<h2>Moving forward</h2>
<p>Behavior, for me, is always something very fascinating that holds my attention. I always try, like our whole team, to produce content that is easy to understand.</p>
<p>Making available information clear is crucial to the decision-making process and guidance on interfaces, and in many cases the displayed information is scarce, garbled or the environment presents misplaced, wrong or contradictory messages, leading the user to fall back to more instinctive techniques such as trial and error, or luck.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered that the orientation process within an interface depends, in addition to its structure, on the way that texts and micro texts are written? In the next post, I will bring the lessons and our decisions to these short texts applied in notifications such as banners and toasts.</p>
<p>In the meantime, do you have any questions, suggestions or want to start a conversation? The comments section is open, and we want to know what you think and your experiences on writing for interfaces! See you soon :)</p>

<p>I’ve been using WordPress CMS for more than 10 years now. I’ve seen its evolution from a blogging platform to a fully featured website builder.</p>



<p>In December 2018, WordPress launched <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gutenberg</a> editor. The community, including myself, received it with mixed feelings.</p>



<p>On the one hand it looked like something innovative, intended to change the way users create and publish content, on the other hand it seemed like an incomplete tool trying to improve something that was already working great.</p>



<div><p>I’m now writing this post using <a href="https://wpindigo.com/wordpress-gutenberg-vs-elementor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gutenberg editor</a> and there is nothing particularly wrong with it. However, I sometimes find it difficult to use and confusing, even after using it on a daily basis. It simply doesn’t provide the user experience I’m used to.</p><p>Overall, I don’t like Gutenberg. Let me explain why. There are so many little things that simply don’t work as required. Here are a few examples:</p></div>



<ul><li><strong>The UI is not intuitive</strong>  – important controls are hidden, there are too many useless options, the icons are confusing and not representative. I don’t need spotlight mode, top toolbar, cog icons and other useless features.</li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1269" height="535" src="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-confusing-icons.png" alt="gutenberg confusing icons" srcset="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-confusing-icons.png 1269w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-confusing-icons-300x126.png 300w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-confusing-icons-1024x432.png 1024w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-confusing-icons-768x324.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1269px) 100vw, 1269px"></figure>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="605" src="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-hidden-options.png" alt="gutenberg hidden options" srcset="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-hidden-options.png 1436w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-hidden-options-300x126.png 300w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-hidden-options-1024x431.png 1024w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-hidden-options-768x324.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px"></figure>



<ul><li><strong>I don’t need the Edit/Select mode</strong> – in previous versions I could select the content from all blocks and copy or move them. Now I have to change the mode from Edit to Select and then I’ll be able to do the same thing. </li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1136" height="286" src="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-edit-select-options.png" alt="gutenberg edit-select options" srcset="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-edit-select-options.png 1136w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-edit-select-options-300x76.png 300w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-edit-select-options-1024x258.png 1024w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-edit-select-options-768x193.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1136px) 100vw, 1136px"></figure>



<ul><li><strong>It’s not front-end editing</strong> – you add blocks in your back-end and preview them in the front-end. There is no way to edit blocks and other elements in the front end (except using the fullscreen mode which is not accurate).</li></ul>







<ul><li><strong>Block/pattern editing is a nightmare</strong> – if you’ve ever used <a href="https://elementor.com/?ref=13693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elementor</a> or any other decent page builder, you’ll understand what I mean. You can easily adjust a simple block like image or button, but when you have a more complex block, things get really complicated. It’s super hard to adjust elements and editing becomes a difficult task.</li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1427" height="621" src="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-block-pattern-editing.png" alt="gutenberg block-pattern editing" srcset="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-block-pattern-editing.png 1427w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-block-pattern-editing-300x131.png 300w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-block-pattern-editing-1024x446.png 1024w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-block-pattern-editing-768x334.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1427px) 100vw, 1427px"></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Embeds are useless</strong> – what’s the point to embed a Youtube video if you can’t adjust the width of the video or set up the autoplay option. You will anyway need to include the video via custom code.</li></ul>







<ul><li><strong>Images</strong> – you can’t simply drag and drop multiple images at once, as in Classic Editor. Now, you have to create a gallery, select your images, post the gallery and adjust the columns. Used to be simpler and more efficient.</li></ul>







<ul><li><strong>Issues</strong> – if something goes wrong, let’s say you create an HTML block and your code is not valid, WordPress will notify you and give you options to Resolve the issue. Why? I don’t need to convert this block, I just want to edit the HTML code, which is not possible without converting the block.</li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1143" height="581" src="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-resolve-block.png" alt="gutenberg resolve block" srcset="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-resolve-block.png 1143w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-resolve-block-300x152.png 300w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-resolve-block-1024x521.png 1024w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-resolve-block-768x390.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1143px) 100vw, 1143px"></figure>



<p>I like changes, but why did they change something that was working really well? Looks like they are pushing this product further, without listening to the community and in my opinion it gets worse.</p>



<p>Thank God we have the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Classic Editor</a> and can use it for now. I hope that Gutenberg will improve and the team will make it more user friendly and easy to use. For now, I will never use it to create new pages or more complex layouts. I think that it’s way behind <a href="https://elementor.com/?ref=13693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elementor</a> and other page builders.</p>



<p>So, what do you think? Is Gutenberg a failure or a success? Please share your thoughts.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>Bcrypt is a <a href="https://qvault.io/2019/12/30/very-basic-intro-to-key-derivation-functions-argon2-scrypt-etc/">key derivation function</a>, which can be thought of as a slow <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/01/very-basic-intro-to-hash-functions-sha-256-md-5-etc/">hash function</a>. Its purpose is to <em>slowly</em> convert a piece of input data to a fixed-size, deterministic, and unpredictable output. A common use-case is to convert a password into an n-bit cryptographic key, which can then be used for safe authentication. </p>



<p>Here at <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/">Qvault,</a> we use Bcrypt in our security systems. Bcrypt is a very popular password hashing function, so much so that it’s the hash function we currently teach the implementation of in our <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/">Practical Cryptography</a> course.</p>



<h2>What Bcrypt Looks Like</h2>



<p>Using Bcrypt on the password <em>myPassword123</em> would produce something like the following:</p>



<pre><strong><em>myPassword123</em> </strong>-&gt;
$2y$12$vUw4OU4EAl4w4vC6/lA33OtDSYGhiIdekdT9iOoSs9/ckwrffaEui</pre>



<p>That output can be used to compare against future hashes against to see if the original data matches.</p>



<h2>Why not compare passwords directly?</h2>



<p>In web development,<em> </em>it is insecure to store user’s passwords in plain text. If an attacker were to gain access to the server’s database they could find raw email/password combinations and use them to attack the same users on other sites. </p>



<p>At the <em>very least</em> we must hash user’s passwords, but hash functions like <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/07/08/how-sha-2-works-step-by-step-sha-256/">SHA-2</a> and MD5 are too fast to be secure. Using a KDF like Bcrypt provides security benefits over fast hashes because it is computationally expensive and slow. If an attacker gains access to a database of password hashes made with fast algorithms it is easy for them to “reverse” the hashes by guessing different inputs and seeing if the outputs match.</p>



<p>For example, let’s say the attacker finds the following entry in a database:</p>



<pre>user@gmail.com 5906ac361a137e2d286465cd6588ebb5ac3f5ae955001100bc41577c3d751764</pre>



<p>They can try hashing common passwords like:</p>



<pre>password1 -&gt;
0b14d501a594442a01c6859541bcb3e8164d183d32937b851835442f69d5c94e
password2 -&gt;
6cf615d5bcaac778352a8f1f3360d23f02f34ec182e259897fd6ce485d7870d4
password3 -&gt; 5906ac361a137e2d286465cd6588ebb5ac3f5ae955001100bc41577c3d751764</pre>



<p><br>The password, <code>password3</code>, produced a matching hash! Now the attacker knows that <code>user@gmail.com</code> is likely to use the password <code>password3</code> on other sites and can go hack other accounts. This is only possible because the attacker is able to quickly compute many hashes per second and guess millions of potential passwords.</p>



<p>A slow KDF like Bcrypt solves this problem.</p>



<h2>Bcrypt Output Format</h2>



<pre>$2a$10$N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMyeIjZAgcfl7p92ldGxad68LJZdL17lhWy
\___/\__/\_____________________________/\___________________________________/
Alg   Cost                  Salt                                            Hash</pre>



<ul><li><code>2a</code>: The hash algorithm identifier (Bcrypt)</li><li><code>10</code>: Cost factor (2<sup><code>10</code></sup>&nbsp;= 1,024 rounds of key expansion)</li><li><code>N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMye</code>: 16-byte (128-bit) salt, base64 encoded to 22 characters</li><li><code>IjZAgcfl7p92ldGxad68LJZdL17lhWy</code>: 24-byte (192-bit) hash, base64 encoded to 31 characters</li></ul>



<p>Direct from <a aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt#Description" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p>



<h2>Bcrypt Explained Step by Step</h2>



<p>Bcrypt can be visualized with the following Go-like pseudo code:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func bcrypt(cost int, salt [16]byte, password [72]byte) (hash string) {
	// Initialize Blowfish state with expensive key setup algorithm
	// This is the slow part of the algorithm
	pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes := expensiveBlowfishSetup(cost, salt, password)

	// Repeatedly encrypt the text "OrpheanBeholderScryDoubt" 64 times
	// 24 bytes = three 64-bit blocks
	ctext := "OrpheanBeholderScryDoubt"
	for i := 0; i &lt; 64; i++ {
		// Encrypt using standard Blowfish in ECB mode
		ctext = encryptECB(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, ctext)
	}

	// return the version, cost, salt, and ctext in the proper format
	return "$2a${cost}${salt}{ctext}"
}</code></pre>



<p>As you can see, Bcrypt depends heavily on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)" rel="noopener">Blowfish</a> cipher. Put simply, Bcrypt is an expensive key expansion coupled with Blowfish encryption.</p>



<p>The <code>expensiveBlowfishSetup</code> function can be understood by following pseudo code:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">// pEighteenSubkeys: array of 18 subkeys
// sFourSubBoxes: Four substitution boxes
// Each S-Box is a 256-length array of uint32
func expensiveBlowfishSetup(cost int, salt [16]byte, password [72]byte) (pEighteenSubkeys [18]uint32, sFourSubBoxes [4][256]uint32) {
	// Initialize arrays
	pEighteenSubkeys := [18]uint32
	sFourSubBoxes := [4][256]uint32

	// Fill pEighteenSubkeys and sFourSubBoxes with the hex digits of pi 
	// This initial state works as in the original Blowfish algorithm
	// it populates the P-array and S-box entries with the fractional part of pi in hexadecimal
	pEighteenSubkeys = fillWithPi(pEighteenSubkeys)
	sFourSubBoxes = fillWithPi(sFourSubBoxes)

	// Permutate P and S based on the password and salt
	pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes = expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, salt, password)

	// This is the "Expensive" part of the "Expensive Key Setup"
	// Otherwise the key setup would be identical to Blowfish
	// Expand the key an exponentially increasing number of times
	// depending on the cost factor
	for i := 0; i &lt; math.Pow(2, cost); i++ {
		pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes = expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, 0, password)
		pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes = expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, 0, salt)
	}

	return pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes
}</code></pre>



<p><code>The expandKey function</code> is executed an exponentially increasing number of times depending on the value of the <code>cost</code> parameter. The <code>expandKey</code> function is explained by the following pseudo-code:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys [18]uint32, sFourSubBoxes [4][256]uint32, salt [16]byte, password [72]byte) (
	pEighteenSubkeys [18]uint32, sFourSubBoxes [4][256]uint32
	) {

	// Mix password into the pEighteenSubkeys array
	// by XORing password with subkeys
	for i := 0; i &lt; 18; i++{
		// treat the password as cyclic, XOR 32 bit chunks of password with subkeys
		pEighteenSubkeys[i] ^= password[i % 18]
	}
 
   // Treat the 128-bit salt as two 64-bit halves 
   saltHalf[0] = salt[0:63]
   saltHalf[1] = salt[64:127]

   // Initialize an 8-byte (64-bit) buffer with all zeros.
   block := [8]byte

   // Mix internal state into P-boxes   
   for i := 0; i &lt; 9; i++ {
	  // XOR 64-bit block with a 64-bit salt half
	  // Each iteration alternating between saltHalf[0], and saltHalf[1]

<p>It helps me to visualize the details of the pseudo-code by using a more “real” programming syntax like Go. If that doesn’t help you then take a look at the code on the <a aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt#Algorithm" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> page here.</p>

<p><em>This is a series of notes on colour search design based on my experiences
desgining search interfaces for the lipstick search engine <a href="http://lipcolourmatch.com/">lipcolourmatch.com</a>.
I will link other parts of the series here as they become available.</em></p>

<h2 id="simple-yet-flexible-the-design-of-the-query-page">Simple yet flexible: the design of the query page</h2>

<p>The initial design of the <a href="http://lipcolourmatch.com/">lipcolourmatch.com</a> search interface drew heavy inspiration
from the relative minimalism of the Google search engine front page, which
has a graphic, a search box and a few buttons as the main features.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/Lipcolourmatch_PP_3.png" alt="Google Search Engine"></p>

<p><em>The design of Google’s text-based search engine is minimal.</em></p>

<p>However, one of the reasons that such a scarcity of elements works for Google’s usecase
is that text search is a good deal more simple than the search interface of a
niche colour search engine. Not only does the UI designer need to provide a suitable
UI element for choosing colours, this UI element also needs to account for the various textural
subtleties that a user may desire to search for.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/duckduckgo-search-bar.gif" alt="DuckDuckGo"></p>

<p><em>DuckDuckGo features a minimal search bar.</em></p>

<p>In the case of lipcolours, a product has variation not only in the shade, but also in the finish.
The same colour can appear as metallic (the formula has a added element for high shine and reflectivity), shimmer (the formula is shiny with tiny sparkles), cream (not as shiny as metallic, but more reflective than matte) and matte, which is usually the most pigmented and least reflective form a lipcolour. These variations in texture need to be taken into account in the search query.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/lipglossdemo.gif" alt="Lipgloss"></p>

<p><em>Searching for a lipgloss in a particular shade on <a href="http://lipcolourmatch.com/">lipcolourmatch.com</a></em></p>

<p>To capture this complexity (the solution described here is not perfect by any means and will certainly require more iterations), the initial colour search UI design for <a href="http://lipcolourmatch.com/">lipcolourmatch.com</a> featured
a colour wheel selector powered by the open source library iro.js and a drop down
control for adding desired finish and product type filters. For example, one could, if
desired search for lipstick and liquid lipstick products in a matte navy blue colour.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/navyblue.gif" alt="Navyblue"></p>

<p><em>Searching for navy blue lipsticks and liquid lips in a matter finish.</em></p>

<h2 id="displaying-the-search-results">Displaying the search results</h2>

<p>The next important step in the design of a colour search engine is the format of
the results. The initial inspiration was once again drawn from the world
of text based search engines where web pages that best match a user’s query are listed
in descending order.  Some search engines like Google paginate the results, while
others like DuckDuckGo offer an infinite-scroll-lazy-loading experience.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/google-pagination.png" alt="Paginated search results from Google"></p>

<p><em>UI design for paginating search results on Google</em></p>

<p>As the user scrolls down, the backend returns more and more results.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/duckduckgo-pagination.gif" alt="DuckDuckGo pagination"></p>

<p><em>DuckDuckGo pagination is an infinite-scroll.</em></p>

<p>In addition to the results, the results pages of search engines usually also
display the original query, to help the user see what they searched for and how well what they found
with the help fo the search engine matches what they searched for.</p>

<p>The initial design of the colour search engine results followed the template above fairly closely.
The results page features a “You searched for” section that shows a coloured circle featuring the
colour the user chose from the colour wheel on the main page and then a list of results in a
descending similarity order. The closest colours (according to the colour search engines similarity metric) are listed first.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/searchresults.png" alt="Search resuslts"></p>

<p><em>Search results from the colour search engine feature the original query, the results in descending order of colour similarity as well as small cards with information.</em></p>

<p>Each search result is displayed with a small card that has a circular colour element that captures the colour of the product. In addition, each card has information about the brand, the product type and the finish.</p>

<h2 id="grid-like-results-to-facilitate-comparison">Grid-like results to facilitate comparison</h2>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/Lipcolourmatch_PP_4.png" alt="Results comparison"></p>

<p><em>One key task a user wants to do is to compare the results with the query. This is farily simple with a text search engine but harder when the query is a colour.</em></p>

<p>One of the main tasks that a user is interested in doing is comparing
the colour in the search query to the colour of the items
returned in the results to see how close the matches are to the query.
Thinking back to the results page of traditional text-based
web search engines, we can see that the pagination design (whether it’s
a traditional pagination UI or an infinitely scrolling UI) does not
interfere with the process of comparison that a user engages in.
We take the query we entered into the search engine and then scan
the results checking which one could potentially have useful
information related to the query. It’s relatively easy to keep
a text query in mind, so the paginated approach does not pose
a major hindrance to the user’s goal of comparing the query to the results.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/mac-chili-pages.gif" alt="Mac Chili Paginated"></p>

<p><em>Paginated search results from the colour search engine. Keeping the exact query colour in mind and paginating to compare results can be hard.</em></p>

<p>However, keeping the exact shade of a colour (the colour in the query) in your mind and then scrolling
or paginating through each result card and comparing the colours is challenging.
You can see for yourself in the animated screencapture above.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/mac-chili-grid.gif" alt="Mac Chili Grid"></p>

<p><em>A grid design facilitates colour comparison.</em></p>

<p>One solution for this would be to dock the “You searched for” card at the top
of the screen while scrolling and thus facilitate quick and easy side by side
comparison. However, for the time being implementing this with the Bootstrap
framework proved too difficult, so instead I’ve opted for implementing a grid
of results with a side by side card arrangement that displays the queried
colour on the left and allows the user to populate the card on the right
with a search result from the grid.</p>

<p>I will be iterating more on this design in the near future and look forward
to sharing what I learn with you!

  <p>Google is an evil company. When they're not <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/11/google-facebook-surveillance-privacy/">surveilling billions of people</a>, they're <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/08/13/google-resumes-its-senseless-attack-on-the-url-bar-hides-full-addresses-on-chrome-canary/">trying to harm the web</a> or <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-25/google-fires-four-employees-citing-data-security-violations">firing employees for organizing</a>. My <a href="https://jake.nyc/words/full-stack-ethics">first entry on this blog</a> was about reasons to avoid Google products. I don't like Google!</p>
<p>The thing is, Google is everywhere, and Google is free. It's probably not much of an exaggeration to say that everyone who spends time online has used a Google service. In a lot of cases, they're the default option that people choose without thinking. At some point, I just decided to stop. No more Google in my life.</p>
<p>Is that even possible in 2020? Mostly!</p>
<p>Some Google services are easily replaced. Others are difficult because of network effects, and still others just don’t seem to have any good competitors that I’ve found.</p>
<p>So here are all the Google services I used to use, how easy it is to avoid them and what I use instead.</p>
<h3 id="google-search">Google search</h3>
<p>I thought this one would be okay, since it’s a big target. The most promising competitor here seems to be <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>, but ultimately I’ve been disappointed by their search results. They're fine for easy queries, like if I type the exact name of what I’m searching for. More complex queries — for example, pasting an error message from my terminal — are not great. DuckDuckGo make it easy to search Google by prefixing a query with <code>g!</code>, which I end up doing far too often.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: medium</strong></p>
<h3 id="google-chrome">Google Chrome</h3>
<p>If you've written it off in the past, you should revisit <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a>. It's fast, its developer tools are great and it aggressively blocks trackers and advertisers. As of writing this, it's blocked 339 trackers for me today.</p>
<p>That said, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363424/mozilla-layoffs-quarter-staff-250-people-new-revenue-focus">Mozilla's recent layoffs</a> — including their <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveALee/status/1293487542382333952">developer tools team</a> — are worrying. If Firefox starts going downhill again, I'll probably switch to Safari. That would suck, though — Firefox is the last major bastion against the Webkit/Blink browser engine monoculture.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: easy</strong></p>
<h3 id="android">Android</h3>
<p>I use an iPhone, so no problems here!</p>
<p>This might be a good time to mention that I have <a href="https://itep.org/fact-sheet-apple-and-tax-avoidance/">qualms</a> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-apple-china-catcher-20180116-story.html">with</a> <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/184283/why-third-party-browsers-will-always-be-inferior-to-safari-on-iphone-and-ipad/">Apple</a>, too — but they seem to be the least worst of the two real choices for a cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: easy</strong></p>
<h3 id="gmail">Gmail</h3>
<p>There are a million and one email services, so I wasn’t expecting too much trouble with this one. Partially because my email address is <code>@jake.nyc</code>, not <code>@gmail.com</code>, so there was no annoying transition where everyone had to update their contact info.</p>
<p>I went with <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a> ($50 per year on their annual plan) and I have no complaints. It was super easy to import all my emails from Gmail. The webmail and phone apps are both good — although because my work uses Gmail, I use <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/">Spark</a> in order to have all my email accounts in one app.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: easy</strong></p>
<h3 id="google-calendar">Google Calendar</h3>
<p>Fastmail email accounts come with a calendar, and it's interoperable with Google calendars. Or they're both compatible with some open standard; I'm not a calendar power user. Whatever the case, it works fine.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: easy</strong></p>
<h3 id="google-maps">Google Maps</h3>
<p>After the disastrous Apple Maps rollout, I was worried that this would be a tough one to replace. Not so! If you have an iPhone, <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/maps/">Apple Maps</a> gives you everything you want in a maps app. And their maps have <a href="https://www.justinobeirne.com/new-apple-maps-continental-united-states">gotten really good</a>. I'm happy to report that you can leave those fears in 2012.</p>
<p>If you're a city dweller like I am, there's an even better option: <a href="https://citymapper.com/">CityMapper</a>, which focuses specifically on public transit. They also have real-time transit alerts and offline maps. I use CityMapper whenever I'm taking public transit, and Apple Maps on the rarer occasion that I'm driving somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: easy</strong></p>
<h3 id="google-docs">Google Docs</h3>
<p>The only two of these I really use are Docs and Sheets. I’m mostly able to cover everything with a combination of tools: <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a> for prose, <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> for general note-taking and <a href="https://www.acqualia.com/soulver/">Soulver</a> for math related stuff. I would like to find a good full–featured spreadsheet replacement but so far that hasn’t been a huge obstacle.</p>
<p>The real issue is that I often use documents and spreadsheets with other people. And unfortunately, Google has built a nice little walled garden here. There's no easy way for me to collaborate with someone else without forcing them to also forego Google Docs. On top of that, other services build on top of Google's products. I use <a href="https://www.tillerhq.com/">Tiller</a> to stay on top of my spending, but they only support importing data into Google Sheets and Microsoft Office 365.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: hard</strong></p>
<h3 id="google-drive">Google Drive</h3>
<p>This is basically the same story as Google Docs, with the caveat that it's much less common for me to need a shared filesystem with someone. I use <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> for myself, which usually suffices when I need to share a file. That said, it's still part of the same ecosystem as Google Docs, which makes it hard to avoid if you use the former.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: medium</strong></p>
<h3 id="google-analytics">Google Analytics</h3>
<p>Privacy conscious analytics services seem to be <em>en vogue</em> these days, so it wasn’t difficult to find a replacement I liked. I picked <a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a> and have been very happy with it. It’s $14 a month and you can put it on as many websites as you want; I have it powering both this site and <a href="https://songrender.com/">SongRender</a>.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of obscure metrics Google Analytics gives you that Fathom doesn’t have, but I’ve never missed them. Maybe I would if I were really into marketing data. But pageviews, uniques, referrers, time on site and bounce rate is enough for me.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: easy</strong></p>
<h3 id="youtube">YouTube</h3>
<p>This one is a little weird, since the differentiating factor between YouTube and competitors is content rather than a set of features. I'm not a big YouTube user so it doesn’t bother me too much, but if someone sends me a video there’s basically no way for me to see it elsewhere.</p>
<p>I’m rating this one “hard” because it’s basically irreplaceable, but as someone who doesn’t watch many YouTube videos anyway it doesn’t really affect me. Your mileage may vary!</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: hard</strong></p>

			<p>stumpled upon a bug in openssh … did a small config change in sshd_config, deployed it with ansible … and <strong>lost connectifity to all these boxes immediately</strong> … and of course, i did a config check before reloading the sshd daemon, and the config check was fine.</p>
<p>i can’t belife that nobody else found this before, as it’s really simple to reproduce. and it’s working with openbsd, debian, centos and mostly on all system which have opensshd implemented (and that’s a lot of …)</p>
<h2 id="reproduce-the-bug">reproduce the bug</h2>
<p>just add the following line to your sshd_config, do a config check and restart sshd. and you will not be able to login aging through ssh!</p>
<p><strong>DON’T TEST THIS ON YOUR PRODUCTION SYSTEMS!</strong></p>
<p>you need a console and root login/password (or do some recovery procedures in single user mode) to fix this !</p>
<pre><code>root@debian:~# echo "Match Address 2001:db8::/16"  &gt;&gt; /etc/ssh/sshd_config
root@debian:~# echo "  AllowTcpForwarding yes"     &gt;&gt; /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Connection closed by 10.1.2.3 port 22
stoege@puffy200 255 ~$
</code></pre><h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>the problem is that you configured a host address instead of network address. this is not recognized by the config checker but by the sshd daemon itself.</p>
<p><strong>so, a simple Typo can bring your ssh daemon down! Reboot safe :)</strong></p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<h3 id="ipv4">IPv4</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Match Address 192.168.1.0/24  -&gt; correct network statement</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Match Address 192.168.1.1/24  -&gt; break your ssh daemon</strong></p>
<p><strong>-&gt; you have either a wrong network mask or a wrong subnet declaration</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and the same with IPv6. and we’re all not that familiar with subnet calculation on v6, are we ?</p>
<h3 id="ipv6">IPv6</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Match Address 2001:db8:1000:2000::/56   -&gt; correct network statement</p>

<li>
<p>Match Address 2001:db8:1000:2001::/128  -&gt; correct host statement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Match Address 2001:db8:1000:2001::/56   -&gt; break you ssh</strong></p>
<p><strong>-&gt; you have either a wrong network mask or a wrong subnet declaration</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="affected-versions">affected Versions</h3>
<p>hard to say. probably all OpenSSH Implemenations up to and including Version 8.3. So, all your SSH Boxes are definitly affected …</p>

        <p><em>The integral of the secant is well known to any beginners calculus student. Yet this integral was once a major outstanding maths problem. It was first introduced by Geradus Mercator, who needed it to make his famous map, in 1569. He couldn’t find it, and used an approximation instead. The exact solution was found accidently 86 years later without calculus in 1645. It then took another two decades until a formal proof was given in 1668, 99 years after Mercator first proposed the problem.</em></p>

<p>As this <a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/how-math-works">comic</a> by SMBC rightly teases, the history of mathematics is often not so straightforward. 
Theorems, formulas and notation that are routinely discussed in class, were once insights or accidents themselves.
This is the story of one such formula, the integral of the secant. 
I first read about it almost a decade ago<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, when I got interested in cartography: the science and art of mapmaking. 
This integral is of vital importance to the Mercator map, and therefore many online maps that use it, like <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/maps/">Apple Maps</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/">Google Maps</a>.</p>

<p>This story has been told several times before: see <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3603395">1</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0025570X.1980.11976846">2</a> or <a href="https://scholarworks.umt.edu/tme/vol7/iss2/12/">3</a>.
But these are all journal articles, consigned mostly to academics.
I want to present it here in a less formal and more colourful setting, to make it more accessible.</p>

<p>This is an article about mathematics, so familiarity with the following is helpful: algebra, trigonometry, radians and basic calculus. 
These are usually covered in advanced high school maths classes or first year maths courses.</p>

<h2 id="first-year-maths">First year maths</h2>

<p>In first year maths at university, after a month of differentiation, we were starting the inverse problem: integration. 
Differentiation  is the mathematics of finding gradient functions for curves.
Integration is the mathematics of inverting this - given a gradient function, what is the curve? 
My lecturer was introducing the integration of trigonometric functions.
He started off with:</p><p>

\[\int sin(x) dx = -cos(x) + c \:\text{  and } \int cos(x) dx = sin(x) + c\]

</p><p>This relationship made sense, because sine and cosine derivatives were opposites. Just had to be careful of minus signs. Next he derived the integral for the tangent:</p><p>

\[\int tan(x) dx = \int \frac{sin(x)}{cos(x)}dx = -ln|cos(x)| + c\]

</p><p>Ok, that was tricky. It was not immediately obvious that the inverse of the chain rule could be used here, because the function $cos(x)$ was present with its derivative $sin(x)$.
But given enough thought, it made sense. Then he said, this is the integral of the secant, and learn it off by heart:</p><p>

\[\int sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + c\]

</p><p>OK, where did that come from? My lecturer offered no explanation. It was easy to verify that it worked by finding the derivative. 
(Paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0025570X.1980.11976846">2</a> has a more complex proof using only integration.)
But how had he come up with that?</p>

<p>I think, at this point, most first year calculus students like me have the following fleeting thoughts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Integration is much harder than differentiation.</li>
  <li>Some mathematician must have stumbled on this through differentiation first.</li>
  <li>It doesn’t matter anyway because where will I ever use this?</li>
</ol>

<p>Actually, number 1 is true, as many a student can testify after writing a test. 
Number 2 is false - in fact it was found by a teacher while looking at raw numbers. 
Such a method for finding an integral is so unusual, that one might conjecture it is the <em>only</em> integral that has been found like this.
Surely in calculus class, where raw numbers are so rare, you would be laughed at if you attempted to solve an integral like that.
Lastly, number 3 remains true for me. But this doesn’t mean this integral isn’t useful - it is used to construct the Mercator map. 
That is why a teacher was crunching numbers when he serendipitously realised what the formula was.</p>

</figure>

<p>The secant is a standard trigonometric function. It is defined as the ratio of the hypotenuse $c$ to the adjacent side $a$ for an angle $\varphi$ in a right angled triangle.
In mathematical notation, the definition is:</p><p>

\[sec(\varphi) = \frac{c}{a}\]

</p><p>It is the reciprocal of the more widely used cosine function:</p><p>

\[sec(\varphi) = \frac{1}{cos(\varphi)}\]

</p><p>Here are the graphs of the secant and cosine for the angles from $-2\pi$ (-360°) to $2\pi$ (360°):</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/secant_graph.png" alt="Definition of the secant">
</figure>

<p>The integral of the secant can be interpreted as the area under the graph<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. This is illustrated by the shaded region.</p>

<h2 id="an-introduction-to-cartography">An introduction to cartography</h2>

<p>The earth, which is a sphere<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, cannot be projected onto a flat map without distortion. 
Over the years, cartographers have devised many different map projections which try to balance minimising distortion with other properties. 
They come in all shapes and sizes.
Lists of these projections can be found <a href="https://map-projections.net/singleview.php">here</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_map_projections">here</a>.
I will explain two of the simplest here, which will help with understanding the Mercator map in the next section.</p>

<p>All map projections can be represented as equations that transform spherical co-ordinates to flat map co-ordinates.
The co-ordinates on the sphere are the angles $\varphi$ and $\lambda$. These correspond to lines of latitude (parallels) and longitude (meridans) respectively. 
The co-ordinates on the flat map are $x$ and $y$. A map projection is therefore a transformation from $\varphi$ and $\lambda$ to $x$ and $y$.</p>

<p>One of the simplest and oldest known projections is the equirectangular projection:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/equirectangular.png" alt="Equirectangular map">
	<figcaption>Equirectangular map. From <a href="https://map-projections.net/single-view/rectang-0">map-projections.net/singleviewp/rectang-0</a>  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It is made by mapping meridians and parallels to vertical and horizontal straight lines of constant spacing.
This has the affect of stretching out objects along the parallels.
The equations for this projection are:</p><p>

\[\begin{align} y &amp;= R\varphi\\ x &amp;= R\lambda \end{align}\]

</p><p>While the equations are simple, the construction process can be hard to visualise. Here is my attempt:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/equirectangular_construction.png" alt="Equirectangular map construction">
	<figcaption>A segment of the sphere is peeled off and flattened.
The right most image shows a top view of the flattening. The arcs are pulled flat in the longitudial direction, so that they become straight lines.
They do not change length in this process, but that requires stretching out the sides along the $x$-axis. 
Thus a single point where all the arcs meet, is stretched into a line.   </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The equirectangular map has a total area of $(2\pi R)(\pi R)=2\pi^2 R^2$ while the surface area of the sphere is $4\pi R^2$. 
Therefore this projection distorts the area by a factor of $\frac{\pi}{2}\approx1.57$.</p>

<p>A different kind of projection can be obtained by projecting lines from the sphere onto the mapping plane. 
An example is the Lambert cylindrical projection. 
It is made by wrapping a cylinder around the sphere and projecting points onto it via lines parallel to the $x$-axis. 
Here is a visualisation of this construction:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/Cilinderprojectie-constructie.jpg" alt="Lambert cylindrical map construction">
	<figcaption>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cilinderprojectie-constructie.jpg">Wikipedia</a>  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And here is a cross section of the sphere along side the final map:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/Lambert_construction.png" alt="Lambert cylindrical  map">
	<figcaption>Lambert cylindrical  map. Edited from <a href="https://map-projections.net/single-view/lambert">map-projections.net/singleviewp/lambert</a>  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The equations are:</p><p>

\[\begin{align} y &amp;= Rsin(\varphi)\\ x &amp;= R\lambda \end{align}\]

</p><p>For objects near the equator, this results in very little distortion, such as for Africa. But objects near the poles are compressed because of the sphere’s curvature. 
This can be seen clearly with Greenland.</p>

<p>This map has the useful property that its area is equal to the surface area of the sphere. Thus, while objects are distorted, their areas are still correct.
The relative scale of Greenland to Africa is therefore accurately represented in this map.</p>

<h2 id="the-mercator-map">The Mercator map</h2>

<p>In 1569, Gerardus Mercator wanted to make a global world map that would be useful for navigation. 
He lived in a time when sailing across vast ocean distances was the norm. (In 1492, Christopher Columbus had discovered America by sailing all the way from Spain.)
The maps shown above are fine for artistic impressions and applications, but not for navigation.
The distortions prevent doing any accurate distance and bearing measurements on the map. 
At a local level, lines (eg. roads) which in reality intersect perpendicularly to each other, would be appear to be slanted with respect to each other.</p>

<p>In particular, Mercator wanted to make a map where rhumb lines would be straight. Rhumb lines are curves of constant bearing relative to meridians. 
To follow a rhumb line, a navigator only needs to maintain the same bearing on their compass for the whole journey.
For example, here is the rhumb line through modern day New York and Cape Town:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/NY_to_CPT.png" alt="Arcs from NY to CPT">
	<figcaption>Made with software from <a href="https://imaginary.org/program/rhumb-lines-and-spirals">imaginary.org/program/rhumb-lines-and-spirals</a> and Inkscape </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At each point along the rhumb line, the angle $\theta$ with the meridian is 48.56°, which corresponds to a bearing of 311°26’18’’ from Cape Town to New York. 
I’ve also shown the great circle, which is a circle whose centre lies on the centre of the sphere. 
Travelling along the great circle is always shorter. In this case, the distance is 12550 km instead of 12600 km along the rhumb line.
With modern technology, it is easy for ships and aeroplanes to stick to the great circles. But back in Mercator’s day, this was rather difficult. 
So sailors preferred to stick to rhumb lines. They would rather get to their destination by travelling a little longer, then get lost and travel a lot more.</p>

<p>Mercator’s idea was to stretch out a cylindrical projection map in the North-South direction to preserve shapes and angles.
Looking at the Lambert projection<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>, it can be seen that a different stretch factor is required for each latitude. At the equator, no stretch is required.
At the 45° parallel only a small amount of upward stretching is required. The objects close to the poles have to be stretched a lot to uncompress them.</p>

<p>This stretch factor can be calculated as follows:</p>
<figure>

	<figcaption>Construction process for the Mercator map. Edited from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection"> Wikipedia</a> images </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>First Mercator divided the globe into graticules of equal spacing $\delta\varphi$ and $\delta\lambda$. 
Along the meridians, the arc length of each graticule is $R\delta\varphi$.
Along the parallels, the radius of the circle is …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I've been working as a <a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-08-17-not-so-brief-history-research-software-engineers-0">Research Software Engineer</a> (RSE) at universities in the UK for many years now, across a variety of fields of research (particle physics, synthetic biology, cardiology, etc.) as both a user of computing services and as a provider of them.
One thing that I've seen cropping up repeatedly is a tendency to want to chase the latest fad.
Now, in academia the latest fad is often up to ten years behind the state-of-the-art so, for example, it's only in the last few years that we've seen "deep learning" cropping up in every grant application.
One of the things I do in my job is try to <a href="https://milliams.com/courses">educate researchers</a> about these technologies so that they know what they're actually asking for and to ensure that if researchers are talking about doing "big data" since they have "megabytes of data" they won't be embarased by a grant reviewer who knows their stuff.</p>
<p>The push in this direction is completely understandable. The grant application business is extremely competitive and anything you can put in your proposal to catch the eye of a reviewer is going to count in your favour.</p>
<p>This is all particularly evident when talking about data.
Research money goes to the problems which are most worthy and there's an assumption that the harder the problem, the more worthy it is.
Furthermore, there's an assumption that the more data one has, the bigger and more difficult the research problem.
This naturally pulls together into an idea that if your problem is a "big data" problem then it's more likely to get funded.
You therefore see grant applications trying to convince reviewers that they're doing "big data" when really they're dealing with linear or spatial datasets of maybe only gigabytes to a terabyte.
That's certainly <em>a lot of</em> data but it often lacks the complexity that requires what one would really consider <em>big</em> data solutions.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not trying to downplay these areas of research.
Instead I'm trying to argue that the problems being solved here are just as worthy of investigation, even without couching it in terms of "big data".
<em>Most</em> research problems I see discussed at Universites are not big data and they are all interesting problems.
I think it would be healthy to reduce the allure of big data and let people know that it's ok to not fall into that category.
Part of the problem is that there's no good name for this scale of data problem: that which is a little too big to realistically do on a single laptop or desktop but well below the size or complexity to require a big data machine or a Hadoop cluster.</p>
<p>I've toyed with many names when trying to teach how to tackle problems of this size: <em>Large Data</em>, <em>Biggish Data</em>, <em>Medium Data</em>.
Until now, none have ever grabbed me so I've decided to coin a new term, <strong>meso-data</strong>.
<em>Meso</em> here means "middle" or "intermediate" cf. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia#Etymology">Mesopotamia</a> ("between rivers").</p>
<div id="meso-computing">
<h2>Meso-computing</h2>
<p>Along with the problem in the data domain (mostly coming from buzzword-chasing), there's a similar issue in the computing-power domain.
Most research follows a common path of starting with a small investigation on a researcher's laptop until they have too many simulations to run or they are taking longer than the working day and so can't be finished in time.
At this point most research institutes will encourage the use of whatever central computing resources they have, usually a single large HPC cluster.</p>
<p>Research institutes such as Universities face a pressure of trying to justify their expenditure on computing resources by extolling all the big problems they're solving: how many nano-seconds of molecular dynamics they're pushing thorugh or how fine-grained the meteorological grid they can simulate.
This encourages the creation of systems which cater towards those few groups in the university who are able to make really good use of a supercomputer — those who can run large multi-node MPI jobs with optimised code for the specific hardware and who have experts in their team who understand high-performance computing.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it further increases the divide in power and complexity between running on one's laptop and using a central facility.
Similar to with meso-data, there's a large number of researchers — I would argue <em>most</em> researchers — whose needs sit right in the middle.
They're not doing <em>super</em>computing, they're doing <em>meso</em>-computing.</p>
<p>These researchers are best supported with small domain-specific batch clusters, with cloud computing (perhaps using <a href="https://cluster-in-the-cloud.readthedocs.io/">Cluster in the Cloud</a>), with software-as-a-service or with just some hands-on help from an RSE to get their code running more efficiently on their laptop.</p>
<p>Maybe Pandas is sufficient or perhaps they need to use Dask.
Maybe <a href="https://milliams.com/courses/parallel_python">a course</a> on <tt>concurrent.futures</tt> to magically make their code finish in a quarter of the time is the right solution.
Regardless, the solution is probably not to rewrite it in Fortran, using MPI to scale across 64 nodes or to rent a Hadoop cluster.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-middle">
<h2>The middle</h2>
<p>There will be those reading this who think I'm stating the obvious, who think "I've been working in this area for years, what's new?".
That's kind of the point, a lot of researchers sit here but the fact is that they are under-served.
Most aren't computer experts and will use whichever tools are available, advertised to them and are easy to use.
This inevitably means that they email to one another Excel spreadsheets with maybe some R or Python scripts with hard-coded paths.
These researchers are getting stuck as "<a href="https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/">Expert Beginners</a>".
People who know their entry-level tools so well the short-term barrier to learning how to use them properly or using a better tool for the job is higher than seems worthwhile.</p>
<p>They want to scale their research but when they look around themselves to see what the University can provide, they're told about getting access to the supercomputer or how if they put their data into an Elasticsearch database things would be better.
That jump is far too big and we need to solve the social problem of allowing them to take only as many steps across the meso-data divide as they need to.
We need well-explained and easy-to-use tools at every stage of the scaling process, not just at the top end.</p>
<p>These terms, <em>meso-computing</em> and <em>meso-data</em>, are deliberately humble.
They are explicitly not about trying to be the biggest but rather about thoughtfully considering the problem at hand and choosing the right hammer.
Unlike with big data, people shouldn't have to ask the question "is this a meso-data problem" because if they're asking the question, the answer is "yes".
I want people to be comfortable saying in grant applications "since this is a meso-data challenge, we request funding for the skills and resources needed to tackle it" and ask for a full-time RSE without having to pretend that they're doing big data or need a dedicated supercomputer.
Labels are helpful and I think that these labels apply well to a good chunk of the research community.</p>
<p>Meso-data comes with its own set of tools and solutions which are partially distinct to big data's.
I haven't invented a whole new area of endeavour, many people have been working on solutions here for decades, but it's certainly not an area that attracts excitement or research money as it should.</p>
<p>These are still hard problems, and in my experience they are solving real-world challenges or furthering our understanding of the universe.
Meso-computing and meso-data projects still need expertise from RSEs or data scientists to make sure that the research is still reliable, reproducible, tested and understandable.</p>

<p><span>Kiwi start-up</span><a href="https://emrod.energy/"> <span>EMROD</span></a><span> has developed the world’s first long-range, high-power, wireless power transmission as an alternative to existing copper line technology.</span></p>
<p><span>The Emrod technology works by utilising electromagnetic waves to safely and efficiently transmit energy wirelessly over vast distances. The prototype received some government funding and was designed and built in Auckland in cooperation with <a href="https://www.callaghaninnovation.govt.nz/">Callaghan Innovation</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It has received a Royal Society Award nomination, and New Zealand’s second largest electricity distribution company, <a href="http://www.powerco.co.nz/">Powerco</a>, will be the first to test Emrod technology.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The company was founded by serial tech entrepreneur Greg Kushnir, who was determined to find a technology that can reduce power distribution costs, avoid outages and support renewable energy.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;“We have an abundance of clean hydro, solar, and wind energy available around the world but there are costly challenges that come with delivering that energy using traditional methods, for example, offshore wind farms or the Cook Strait here in New Zealand requiring underwater cables which are expensive to install and maintain,” said Mr Kushnir.</span></p>
<p><span>“I wanted to come up with a solution to move all that clean energy around from where it’s abundant to where it’s needed in a cost-effective, eco-friendly way.</span></p>
<p><span>“Energy generation and storage methods have progressed tremendously over the last century but energy transmission has remained virtually unchanged since Edison, Siemens, and Westinghouse first introduced electric networks based on copper wires 150 years ago.”</span></p>
<p><span>When Mr Kushnir investigated ways to transmit energy wirelessly over vast distances he was struck by how little has been done in the field.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Everyone seems to be fixated on the notion that energy comes to consumers as electricity over copper wires and I knew there had to be a better way,”</span></p>
<p><span>Kushnir approached distinguished NZ scientist Dr Ray Simpkin of Callaghan Innovation who lead a feasibility study and worked on the prototype. Callaghan Innovation backed Emrod with a research and development grant and seconded their lead scientist to work on the game changing prototype.</span></p>
<p><span>By significantly reducing infrastructure costs, Emrod’s technology has the capacity to support remote communities such as in Africa and the Pacific Islands by providing access to cheap, sustainable energy to power schools, hospitals, and economies.</span></p>
<p><span>“The statistics are pretty compelling. We are talking about a potential 50 per cent increase in sustainable energy uptake, up to 85 per cent reduction in outages and up to 65 per cent reduction in electricity infrastructure costs due to the Emrod solution,” said Kushnir.</span></p>
<p><b>Powering our local communities</b></p>
<p><span>The company has achieved strong interest from electricity distributors with </span><a href="https://www.powerco.co.nz/"><span>Powerco</span></a><span>, New Zealand’s second-largest distributor deciding to invest in a proof of concept of the technology.</span></p>
<p><span>“We’re committed to innovation, and finding new ways to deliver power safely and efficiently to our customers”, says Powerco’s Network Transformation Manager Nicolas Vessiot.</span></p>
<p><span>“We’re interested to see whether Emrod’s technology can complement the established ways we deliver power. We envisage using this to deliver electricity in remote places, or across areas with challenging terrain.”</span></p>
<p><span>“There’s also potential to use it to keep the lights on for our customers when we’re doing maintenance on our existing infrastructure.”</span></p>
<p><span>Emrod will deliver the</span><span> next prototype to Powerco in October </span><span>and will spend two to three months carrying out lab testing and training Powerco personnel before moving to a field trial.</span></p>
<p><span>“The system we are currently building for Powerco will transmit only a few kilowatts but we can use the exact same technology to transmit 100 times more power over much longer distances. Wireless systems using Emrod technology can transmit any amount of power current wired solutions transmit,” said Kushnir.</span></p>
<p><b>Safety is Paramount</b></p>
<p><span>Safety of the prototype is also front of mind for Emrod, who is using a non-ionizing Industrial, Scientific and Medical frequency (ISM) band to transmit power.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The company has been communicating with the regulator Radio Spectrum Management (RSM) continuously from the get go and maintaining the highest safety standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“The rigorous process we are undertaking is aimed at proving the technology is safe with higher power levels on a larger scale. It also helps in creating maintenance guidelines for companies like Powerco that will be using our devices,” said Kushnir.</span></p>
<p><span>“We have chosen this widely used and well-regulated frequency because there’s a long history of using it safely around humans and its scientifically proven safety guidelines, which are accepted internationally.</span></p>
<p><span>ENDS</span></p>

<p>DebConf20 was due to take place in Haifa, Israel this year (<a href="https://debian.community/debconf20-palestine-messages-censored-debian-project/">a separate controversy about Debian censoring Palestine</a>) but it was moved online due to the pandemic.</p>

<p>Therefore, what happens to all the sponsorship money collected in 2020?  Let's look at how Debian parks money in Switzerland.</p>

<p>For the first time ever, Debian paid somebody to work on DebConf fundraising <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/alums/">as an Outreachy</a>, generating a lot of gossip that is unfair to the woman concerned.  Naturally, as in any business, fundraising salaries and other costs of acquiring sponsors are the first things that will be deducted from the budget.  We share the view of those who feel she was underpaid: the woman is a highly experienced event organizer.  Debian paid a total of $6,000 for her services, $2,000 per month.  $500 was deducted by Outreachy administrator, Sage Sharp.  This is also controversial, as Sage Sharp does the same work that Debian's GSoC Administrators do, Sage Sharp receives a cut of the money but the Debian GSoC Administrators don't receive anything.  If the woman was employed at an event management company in Israel, she would have received more than $6,000 <em>every</em> month, overtime pay, illness and accident insurance, pension, maternity rights and a performance bonus.  Many non-profit organizations give their fundraising staff at least 10% of all revenues as salary and bonus.  With her experience, the woman in question would easily get that salary package in any other industry.</p>

<p>After deducting the $5,500 Outreachy salary and $500 Sage Sharp fees, what does Debian do with the rest of the money <a href="https://debconf20.debconf.org/sponsors/">from these sponsors</a>?  As we are online in 2020, there are no venue expenses, no travel and accommodation expenses.  We estimate that DebConf has received over $100,000 from these companies and nobody knows where it will go.</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Item</th><th>Increase</th><th>Decrease</th></tr>
<tr><td>Sponsor donations</td><td>$100,000</td><td></td></tr>

<tr><td>DebConf20 online surplus</td><td>$94,000</td><td></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<em>(Not actual figures, estimated from previous DebConfs)</em>

<p>Will this money be used to pay all the volunteers for the next DebConfs?  Or will it be used for other Debian purposes?</p>

<p>Let's have a look at DebConf13 to find the answer.</p>

<img width="40%" alt="Debian hiding money Switzerland" src="https://debian.community/assets/debconf13-logo.png">
<p>DebConf13 organizers had organized the venue and catering contracts separately.  Neither the venue hire or catering contract included provision for washing the dishes.  At the last minute, DebConf organizers had to reach out to local labor-hire companies to find temporary workers and <a href="https://debian.community/assets/2013-07-08-urgent-dishwashing-proposal.pdf">they received a proposal for the work</a>.  Nonetheless, they didn't want to pay people.  As usual, various people suggested they should try to conscript volunteers to do this tedious work:</p>

<blockquote><em>
Subject: Re: [Debconf-team] Urgent: Dishwashing &amp; Cleaning<br>

From: Tiago Bortoletto Vaz &lt;tiago@debian.org&gt;<br>
To: debconf-team@lists.debconf.org<p>

On Mon, Jul 08, 2013 at 07:57:07PM +0200, Holger Levsen wrote:<br>
&gt; seriously, buy two dishwashing machines (max 1000€ total) and let them be<br>
&gt; filled by volunteers... 5k for dishwashing is like 3% of our total budget.<br>

I'd join a team to coordinate volunteers on this.</p></em></blockquote>

<p>Volunteers don't come to DebConf to wash dishes, they want to relax after dinner, meet people, attend any evening seminars and learn new things.</p>

<img width="30%" alt="debian women, diversity, washing dishes, debconf, outreachy, intern, woman" src="https://debian.community/assets/debconf13-women-washing-dishes.jpg">
<p>Nonetheless, organizers proceeded to seek volunteers for this task.  We notice that female participation in dishwashing was close to thirty percent, much higher than the <a href="https://debian.community/laura-arjona-reina-carnival-mafia-murders/">two percent rate of female participation in development</a>.  Is that a win for diversity?</p>

<p>While discussion about expenditures and volunteers took place on the public <em>debconf-team</em> list, discussions about profit from fundraising were kept on <em>debian-private</em> (<a href="https://debian.community/debian-private-leaked/">leaked elsewhere</a>).  Local volunteers, who do most of the work in each DebConf destination, were subscribed to <em>debconf-team</em> but they never have access to <em>debian-private</em> so they didn't see the following email:</p>

<blockquote><em>Subject: Call for ideas -- useful ways of spending Debian money<br>
Date: Tue, 1 Oct 2013 21:46:17 +0200<br>
From: Lucas Nussbaum &lt;leader@debian.org&gt;<br>
To: debian-private@lists.debian.org<br>
CC: auditor@debian.org, philipp@hug.cx<p>

[ TL;DR: <b>ETOO_MUCH_MONEY</b> -- need ideas to flush queue ]</p><p>

Hi,</p><p>

Thanks to the fantastic work of the DebConf13 sponsorship (fundraising)<br>
team, DebConf13 generated a surplus. The current estimate of it is <b>CHF 38k</b> (that's <b>USD 42k</b>, or <b>EUR 31k</b>). That's excellent news.</p><p>

The not-so-excellent news is that it means that the debconf13<br>
association will have to pay income taxes for it. (no estimate yet;<br>
Philipp Hug (DC13 and debian.ch treasurer) will get in touch with a tax<br>
expert).</p><p>

Even if Switzerland has been very welcoming towards Debian, it would not<br>
be a bad idea to try to avoid paying too much taxes. A good way to do<br>
that is to spend some of the surplus (in ways useful to Debian, of<br>
course).</p><p>

Could you start thinking of useful ways to spend some money? servers?<br>
porter boxes? buildds? sprints? Of course, it would need to be spent before<br>
the end of 2013. There are no known restrictions on what we can buy or<br>
where we can ship. What we end up buying will of course be made public<br>
as usual. To move forward, please reply to this mail, providing an<br>
estimate and a justification. Or mail leader@ + auditor@ if you prefer.</p><p>


Somehow related: we are participating in GNOME's Outreach Program for<br>
Women, winter edition[1].</p><p>

As already stated in April[2], I wouldn't favor a situation where Debian<br>
funds are used to pay OPW participation on a regular basis. However, as<br>
an experiment, it makes sense to help that happen for the first time (it<br>
didn't happen in the summer edition).</p><p>

So, if the fundraising effort currently being set up fails to raise<br>
enough money for one stipend, but still raises a significant amount of<br>
money, I will authorize the use of Debian money for the difference<br>
(likely for at most $2900 -- that's half the stipend, so the other half<br>
needs to come from fundraising).</p><p>

[2] https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2013/04/msg00108.html</p><p>


Q: Why is this on -private@?<br>
A: Because I'm not sure yet how cautious we need to be about the DC13<br>
   surplus situation. Better safe than sorry. We can restart the<br>
   discussion on a public list when/if things are cleared.<br>
 Thanks,</p><p>

Lucas</p></em></blockquote>

<p>Let us amend that final answer:</p>

<blockquote><em>Q: Why is this on -private@?<br>
A: because we didn't mention this money in the thread about washing dishes<br>
</em></blockquote>

<p>Despite Nussbaum's intention to spend the money, it remains in a Swiss bank account with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostFinance">PostFinance</a>.</p>

<img width="30%" alt="Miriam Ballhausen, Bird &amp; Bird, Women in Business Law Awards 2020 Finalist" src="https://debian.community/assets/twobirds-bird-bird-miriam-ballhausen-women-business-law-award-finalist-2020.jpg">
<p>Where does all the money go?  Well, we know that some of it goes to lawyers.  After a volunteer's father died, Debian was the only organization to send him insults through a lawyer.  We've been told Miriam Ballhausen at Bird &amp; Bird charges EUR 300 per hour for her services, which now includes writing emails and letters on behalf of the Debian project.  The Debian Project doesn't exist as a legal entity, Ballhausen has so far refused to reveal who is actually instructing her.</p>

<p>If that rate is correct, the EUR 31,000 profit from DebConf13 would pay for 100 hours or two weeks of full-time lawyer work.  We doubt that we will see Frau Ballhausen assisting with the dishes.</p>

<p>We would have thought that the legal profession may have some minimum standards, expecting lawyers to respect volunteers at a time of grief and expecting them to be able to identify who they work for.  Not in Germany.  Ballhausen's antics with Debian have seen her <a href="https://awards.womeninbusinesslaw.com/Europe-shortlist?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=wibl-eu&amp;utm_content=twittershare#Rising-stars">nominated for the Women in Business Law Awards 2020</a>.</p>

<img alt="Miriam Ballhausen, insults, harassment, abuse, volunteer, GDPR" src="https://debian.community/assets/bird-bird-miriam-ballhausen-gdpr-abuse-debian.png">

<p>The next DebConf for 2021 was supposed to go to Prishtina, Kosovo.  It has been suggested it will be pushed back one year to 2022 but given the pandemic situation, that is not a definite decision.  There are currently no Debian Developers in Kosovo who have access to the financial information in <em>debian-private</em>, we hope that Debian will be as generous in paying the Kosovo local team as they have been with lawyers but we are doubtful.</p>

<p>I’ve heard ham radio is dying since as far back as I can remember. It’s one of those common sayings you always hear. Like, “get off my lawn,” and “kids these days.” But is it true? Is there any evidence to support this? Let’s take a closer look.</p>



<h2>Ham radio licensees are increasing</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0.png" alt="" width="733" height="447" srcset="http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0.png 900w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0-300x183.png 300w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0-768x469.png 768w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0-850x519.png 850w" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px"></figure>



<p>Data from the ARRL shows that ham radio licensees are increasing. When you look at the chart above, you see two significant markers that are likely driving this growth. </p>



<ul><li>The removal of the code requirement by the FCC.</li><li>The economic collapse of 2008.</li></ul>



<p>The Morse code requirement was always an intimidating part of obtaining your General FCC license. Learning Morse code is like learning a second language. It takes time and effort to learn, and that’s not a bad thing. However, it doesn’t change that it scared many people away from the hobby. When the FCC removed this requirement in 2007, I believe it opened the door for many who spent years on the fence. Then you have the economic downturn of 2008. What does that have to do with ham radio? A lot.</p>



<p>After the economic downturn, the United States watched as survivalism, now commonly calling “prepping,” entered mainstream culture. People were worried as the country was involved in multiple wars and our economy was on the brink of collapse. Citizens stocked up on food storage, water, firearms, and…<em>communications equipment</em>. As our country spiraled into more turmoil ham radio licenses steadily increased to more than 750,000 by the end of 2019. </p>



<h2>Is ham radio a hobby or a public service?</h2>



<p><strong>The debate between ham radio being a public service or just a hobby is a common argument</strong>. The reason we exist is to ultimately have a trained citizenry that can response to natural disasters. This will always be a thread in our hobby, but this thread is merging more and more with digital functions, including the Internet. That’s where some people get grumpy.</p>



<h3>FT8/JS8Call</h3>



<p><a href="https://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjtx.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FT8/JS8Call</a> has drew the ire from older operators who don’t see it as “real ham radio.” Though the technology could have huge implications for passing traffic when conditions are rough in remote parts of the world.</p>



<h3>Digital Mobile Radio (DMR)</h3>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_mobile_radio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Mobile Radio</a> has exploded in growth in the past decade. Many amateur radio operators use <a href="http://k0lwc.com/what-is-the-range-of-a-dmr-hotspot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Internet-connected hotspots</a> to operate from their shack without tying up local repeaters. These Internet-connected repeaters hold value, the biggest is the ability to have two different time slots carrying voice traffic simultaneously on one repeater, whether they have an Internet connection or not. DMR doesn’t need to have an Internet backbone to be a game-changer for emergency communications.</p>



<p>Ham radio will always be a hobby where those engaged are practicing to help if the need ever arises, whether they participate in public service events with local clubs or not. And younger operators are redefining how it’s done with new digital technologies — and that’s a great thing!</p>



<h2>Millennials are not killing ham radio… they’re the future</h2>



<p>Some ham radio operators believe younger hams are “killing” the hobby. These often dismissive and vile opinions are not great for the future of amateur radio. Integrating new technology like VOIP and microcomputers into amateur radio is what it’s all about—using the resources available to communicate and exchange information with others around the world. Who cares how we get it done?</p>



<h3>Getting young kids involved in ham radio</h3>



<p>We must get children interested in the hobby. Today, kids aren’t impressed with the ability to talk around with the world on 100 watts and a wire. They’re just not. How do we get young people interested in the digital age where they can communicate anywhere in the world with a tap of a button? The ARRL hasn’t done a great job in attracting young people — but there are things we can do!</p>



<h3>Capitalize on the next generation of space exploration</h3>



<p>The United States is embarking on the next generation of space exploration. Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin are making space and engineering cool again, and ham radio could easily ride that wave. Focus on targeting kids interested in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics and educate them on AMSAT and the potential to communicate with the International Space Station (ISS). Using space exploration as a drive for getting a ham license would be a fantastic entry point for space geeks everywhere.</p>



<h3>Use remote HF and SWL stations to spark interest</h3>



<p>For young ham radio operators who already have their license, look no further than <a href="https://www.remotehamradio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remote Ham Radio</a> as a shining example of how to get kids interested in upgrading their license. <a href="https://www.remotehamradio.com/youth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">They offer a program where kids can win free time</a> using world-class remote DX contest stations. The young hams have to meet the following criteria:</p>



<ul><li>Be 25 years old or younger</li><li>Hold a General class or higher license</li><li>Be a member of the ARRL</li><li>Have an interest or experience in DXing/Contesting</li><li>Tell us why RHR would be a good fit for you</li></ul>



<p>Kudos to Remote Ham Radio for offering this program to young hams!</p>



<h3>POTA/SOTA combines ham radio and outdoor adventure</h3>



<p>Living in Colorado, I grew fond of Summits On The Air (SOTA) rather quickly. I mean, it’s cool. You can exercise while playing ham radio all at the same time. We should be focusing on how we can use these outdoor portable operations to attract young hams who love the outdoors. For the extreme outdoor enthusiasts, it would be wise to focus on the usefulness of being able to communicate from the wilderness where cell phone signals are non-existent.</p>



<p><strong>Ham radio has evolved</strong>, albeit slowly compared to other technology sectors. That evolution is inevitable. We can’t fight it. We shouldn’t fight it. We need to find ways to encourage new exploration of communication methodology. That all starts with younger ham radio operators bringing new ideas and skills to our hobby.</p>



<p>Let’s not fight it. Let’s embrace it.</p>

<p>Two months ago, I self-published a book called <a href="https://zerotosoldbook.com/">Zero to Sold: How to Start, Run, and Sell a Bootstrapped Business</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/arvidkahl/status/1277573850297966592">released it on Twitter</a>. Within twenty-four hours, I sold 350 copies. Within another twenty-four hours, the book was #1 on Product Hunt and already a category bestseller on Amazon. After a week, 1000 copies had been sold, with sales still going strong and the book ranking as #1 New Release in the “Startups” and “Small Business” Amazon categories. How did this happen?</p>

<h2>The Void</h2>



<p>It started with a blog post that I never published. In 2018, I was so fully immersed in working on <a href="https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/from-founding-to-exit-in-two-years-the-feedbackpanda-story/">FeedbackPanda, a teacher productivity SaaS</a> that I co-founded with my partner <a href="https://twitter.com/SimpsonDaniK">Danielle</a>, that I didn’t have much time or energy to write. Every day was filled with customer conversations and product work, with barely any space to reflect on what we had learned. I used the few moments of clarity to jot down notes in a text document, hoping that I’d find some time to polish them into an article. But it never got anywhere near being ready to be published.</p>



<p>And then, we <a href="https://www.sureswiftcapital.com/blog/bootstrapped-saas-founders-sell-business/">chose to sell the business</a>. After a few months of due diligence and transitioning the business over to the new owners, I finally had all the time I ever wanted. My life turned from running a business at full speed into idling my thumbs. When you build an exceptionally sellable company, you focus on making yourself replaceable. Little did I know that once I was replaced, I didn’t have a purpose anymore. So I threw myself right into my next project: documenting what we did and sharing what we had learned. Leading up to building FeedbackPanda, I had consumed a lot of content that successful founders had shared with the community. I wanted to do the exact same thing now: give back to other bootstrapped founders and indie hackers.</p>



<p>Since I hadn’t yet decided on a medium through which I would share my insights, I started collecting content ideas by taking notes whenever I thought of a particular theme. I knew that I would want to release articles on many subjects on a platform, so I planned them out as blog posts from the start. I started working on this list in August of 2019.</p>



<p>Initially, all those ideas revolved around coping with stress and anxiety on some level. That had been the emotional state in which I had found myself in towards the end of running FeedbackPanda. The first series of blog posts I wanted to write was called <a href="https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/emotional-journey/">The Emotional Journey of a Bootstrapped Founder</a>.</p>



<p>In a Notion document, I created a table of all my blog post title ideas. Quickly, after I had exhausted all my anxiety-related topics, I pivoted into other areas of running a SaaS business as well. Within a couple days, I had aggregated somewhere between forty and fifty blog post ideas. At that point, I understood for the first time that this might be my next big project.</p>

<p>Whenever I felt like it, I would click on each blog post title idea and jot down a few thoughts on what I’d write about in the article. I would add links to interesting essays, research papers, even photos of little sketches I made on paper.</p>

<p>Several blog posts took shape over the weeks, and I decided to turn this project into reality. I polished those articles following <a href="https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro">Julian Shapiro’s recommendations</a>. I ended up with ten or so pieces to start the blog with.</p>



<h2>The Blog</h2>



<p>Here’s an open secret about me: I’m incredibly lazy. If I can avoid tedious work, I’ll spend a lot of time to make sure I never have to do it again. While this really helped us build a well-documented and highly automated business, it is a drawback for a content creator. Writing well and regularly takes a lot of discipline. I knew that I needed some structure in place to hold myself accountable beyond the articles I had already written.</p>



<p>To make sure that this project wouldn’t just evaporate, I decided to commit to building a blog by publishing one article every week, for at least two years. But how could I force myself to write every week? Looking at the content that I regularly consume, I figured that releasing a newsletter every week would keep me accountable for writing something meaningful regularly.</p>



<p>When I built The Bootstrapped Founder blog, I immediately set it up to host the Bootstrapped Founder Newsletter. I released the first episode of that within days of making the blog public. <a href="https://twitter.com/arvidkahl/status/1194647611988480000">I announced the launch on Twitter</a>, and got just a few likes. Not surprising.  I had a fledgling audience of maybe 500 followers on Twitter, and I made sure to share my content as much as I could within those first few weeks, including <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/the-bootstrapped-founder/launched-the-bootstrapped-founder-blog--LtZG5nAqrB8ucRj5F-v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the IndieHackers product page</a> I had created for the blog.</p>

<p>My Twitter strategy was simple: just be myself. I love reading the stories of other founders, no matter if they are succeeding or struggling. Amplifying those voices, retweeting their milestones, and commenting when they asked for help was something I consciously did every day. Within weeks, my audience grew, apparently both intrigued by my blog posts, levels of activity, and engagement with the community.</p>



<p>That gave me the fuel to write more and more. There were weeks where I’d work on three to five blog posts at the same time, driven by the discussions I had on Twitter. More and more topics and themes emerged through this work. The list of forty blog post title ideas turned into a list of hundreds of topics, all in different stages of being worked on.</p>



<p>Throughout all of this, people started asking to consume my content on another medium: they wondered if I would ever start a podcast. As a German who learned speaking English mostly from watching Al Bundy on Married with Children and raid-leading large groups of gamers in World of Warcraft back in 2008, I hesitated to put myself out there in an audio-only format. But I quickly understood that this would result in many exciting opportunities: I could diversify my userbase to include those who had no time to read, those who didn’t like reading, it would be another channel to market whatever I would end up selling in the future, and it would allow my readers to put a voice to the thoughts. I would just read the article aloud as the first half of each show. Then, I could add some unscripted content to each episode to make it attractive for those who already read what I had written. Since I wanted the material between the podcast and the blog to be synchronized, I spent a few weeks recording a show or two every day to catch up.</p>



<h2>The Guide</h2>



<p>While I was on this journey through my back catalog, I noticed a fascinating thing. All those blog posts titles I had written when random thoughts had occurred to me seemed to fit into a structure. A larger entity started to take shape. After a few hours of shuffling titles around in a Notion document, I had found that I was well on my way to write a fully-fledged guide on bootstrapping. Without knowing or intending for it to happen, here it was, everything I knew about the journey from idea to acquisition.</p>



<p>I had written maybe 30% of the actual articles I wanted to have in that guide. I decided to go at it for the rest of them the only way I know as a software engineer and bootstrapper: sketch out a foundation and then iterate slowly and deliberately. For the guide (that at that point was called “The Bootstrapped Founder Guide to Bootstrapping,”) that meant that it would start with a compendium. I outlined it by sorting the blog posts I had already written into a structure and putting only headlines in the gaps. Then, over a few days, I filled out those gaps with two to three paragraphs each. I condensed the most important points I would want to make in those yet-to-be-written articles into a few sentences.</p>



<p>And then, I <a href="https://twitter.com/arvidkahl/status/1222896794893336578">immediately released the compendium</a> on the 30th of January of 2020, two months after I had started writing on the blog. A few days prior, a Twitter follower had suggested the name “From Zero to Sold,” which I really liked. I shortened it to “Zero to Sold,” and featured the compendium prominently on my website and social media profiles.</p>

<p>From there on, I continued to write an article every week, shared it with my growing newsletter audience, read it on the podcast, and integrated it into the compendium. When I had written around half of the number of articles I wanted to write, someone on Twitter asked me if they could get the compendium as a PDF. They said they’d even pay $10 for it. That really made me think. And when I think, I tweet. Lots of people replied that they’d love to see the compendium fleshed out as a full book.</p>



<p>Suppose you’ve looked into Zero to Sold or have checked out the compendium. In that case, you will know that I recommend an Audience-Problem-Solution-Product approach. Start with a group of people you want to help, find their critical problems, envision a solution that fits their workflow, and build a product in the medium they wish to use. And here was a group of founders and indie hackers (an audience I love), telling me that they need guidance on building their business (a critical problem commonly shared), asking for a full-journey guide (a clear solution to the problem), as a book (as a medium of product consumption). This could not be more validated if I wanted to.</p>



<p>So I sat down to write the rest of the book.</p>



<h2>The Manuscript</h2>



<p>Let me share a few details on how that exactly happened. The first few blog posts were written in Notion, which really didn’t lend itself to long-form writing. I quickly migrated those texts over into individual markdown files, which I …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re interested in a <a href="https://blog.graphqleditor.com/why-you-should-try-graphql/">writeup about GraphQL itself head on over here</a>. In this piece, we’ll take a look at some of the many handy GraphQL tools that make using it even more worthwhile. Bear in mind there’s quite a few of them so we’re not going to get through the lot of them in one go.</p>
<h2>Prisma</h2>
<p>As mentioned before, working with GraphQL will require you to set up a database. Well, there’s also BaaS so you can outsource it, but what if you don’t want to? This is where Prisma comes in, it’s a clever middle ground between doing it yourself and outsourcing.
<strong>Prisma is an ORM library</strong> that lets you interact with the database from the server in the language you choose. So if you want to write to your MySQL database you don’t have to do it in SQL, Prima lets you do it in Python, JavaScript or some other language you prefer. </p>
<p>You might think: <em>“Yeah, but that’s just what a regular ORM library does”</em>. True, but Prisma comes with a few added functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>database agnostic: Prisma currently supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and AWS Aurora, with more to come soon,</li>
<li>supports TypeScript, JavaScript, Flow, and Go,</li>
<li>provides premade basic CRUD queries.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relay</h2>
<p><strong>Relay is a JavaScript framework</strong> created by Facebook for fetching and managing GraphQL data. Relay is supposed to be the go-to tool for GraphQL users with a focus on validating and optimizing your code. Another focal point is being a <strong>bridge between GraphQL and React</strong>. Relay lets you set up your data requirements using GraphQL and then it will handle the fetching, collecting queries into network requests to get you exactly what you wanted.</p>
<p>Relay is composed of three main loosely coupled modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relay Compiler: a GraphQL compiler that analyzes, validates, and optimizes GraphQL in your code.</li>
<li>Relay Runtime: a full-featured GraphQL runtime for building higher level client APIs</li>
<li>Relay/React: a product API that integrates Relay Runtime with React</li>
</ul>

<h2>Apollo</h2>
<p><strong>The APOLLO platform</strong> is an implementation of GraphQL that transfers data from the server to your UI. <strong>Apollo-client</strong> is a comprehensive state management library for JavaScript that lets you manage both local and remote data with GraphQL. The aim is to enable you to build UI components that fetch data via GraphQL. <strong>Apollo-server</strong> is a quick way for building an API for GraphQL using data from any source by using a spec-compliant server that can be queried from any GraphQL client, including the Apollo-client. </p>
<p>Let’s look at the Apollo-client features:</p>
<ul>
<li>a declarative approach to data fetching, all the logic for retrieving data, tracking, loading and uploading it to the UI is contained in a single query,</li>
<li>designed for modern React, the Apollo client takes advantage of the latest React features such as hooks,</li>
<li>adaptable, can be dropped into any JavaScript app seamlessly,</li>
<li>universally compatible, can be used with any GraphQL API.</li>
</ul>

<h2>URQL</h2>
<p><strong>urql is a versatile and highly adaptable GraphQL client</strong> by Formidable labs. It uses React hooks and components and intends to be a lighter client than the others. A versatile tool that you can <strong>customize to fit your needs</strong> and fine-tune as you get further along working with GraphQL. </p>
<p>The aim is hitting a middle ground, keeping it somewhat simple while also being able to handle complex assignments by:</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>All networking applications essentially boil down to stringing together
multiple asynchronous calls in the <em>right</em> way.
Traditionally for programs written in C this would be done through
registering callbacks where the callee either handles the event itself
or dispatches through a state machine.
In such implementations however reasoning about memory safety
can be treacherous, with it sometimes requiring full-program knowledge.
Futures, or promises, as they are also referred to,
ease in that regard by allowing asynchronous programs
to be written in direct style, keeping the control flow linear.</p>

<p>All things considered, I do think that futures can be a good fit
for C programming under the right circumstances.
I also hope this article can serve to help one understand Rust futures,
by being a separate reference that only touches the fundamentals.</p>

<p>The Rust futures story is especially interesting because it is
fundamentally different from the usual workings of futures
in functional languages or, say, JavaScript.
Whereas other implementations are <em>push</em>-based -
meaning you give a function to be pushed to with
the resolved result of the future -
Rust futures are <em>poll</em>-based.
Let us see how this looks in C with the simplification
that we limit ourselves to a single task,
i.e. one top-level future running on one thread.
This is common in embedded programming, and still <em>fairly</em> manageable
without the security guarantees given by Rust.
<a href="https://libuv.org/">libuv</a> is used for the event loop.
No heap allocations will be required - it is all downhill from here
(Get it? Because the stack grows down.) -
other than those imposed by the libuv interface.</p>

<p>The main <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/trait.Future.html"><code>std::future::Future</code></a> trait
translated into C as a virtual method table becomes</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Poll</span> <span>{</span> <span>POLL_PENDING</span><span>,</span> <span>POLL_READY</span> <span>};</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>enum</span> <span>Poll</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>poll</span><span>)(</span><span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>*</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Context</span> <span>*</span><span>ctx</span><span>);</span>

	<span>// For now let's skip this method</span>
	<span>// void (*drop)(struct Future *self, struct Context *ctx);</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>As an example, let us consider the simplest case:
A future that immediately resolves with the number <code>4</code>,</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Poll</span> <span>simpleFuturePoll</span><span>(</span><span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>*</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Context</span> <span>*</span><span>ctx</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>struct</span> <span>SimpleFuture</span> <span>*</span><span>state</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>struct</span> <span>SimpleFuture</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>self</span><span>;</span>
	<span>self</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>POLL_READY</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>SimpleFuture</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>future</span><span>;</span>
	<span>int</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>simpleFuture</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>.</span><span>future</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>.</span><span>poll</span> <span>=</span> <span>simpleFuturePoll</span><span>,</span> <span>}</span> <span>};</span>

<span>// ... and in the event loop</span>
<span>simpleFuture</span><span>.</span><span>poll</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>simpleFuture</span><span>,</span> <span>ctx</span><span>);</span> <span>// =&gt; POLL_READY</span>
<span>// Here we can now use the result</span>
<span>simpleFuture</span><span>.</span><span>result</span> <span>// =&gt; 4</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>To <em>attempt</em> to resolve the future, we poll it;
it returns <code>POLL_READY</code> and as such we are done.
And for futures that instead return <code>POLL_PENDING</code> when polled,
we just make sure to poll them again later -
futures are lazy and do not make progress unless actively told to do so.
No one knows better than the future itself when it should
be polled again - <em>awoken</em> -
so the context given to all futures allows them to awake their own task.
With many parallel tasks the additional complexity would make itself apparent here,
but in our case something like</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Context</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>*</span><span>mainFuture</span><span>;</span>
	<span>uv_loop_t</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>wakeTask</span><span>(</span><span>struct</span> <span>Context</span> <span>*</span><span>ctx</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>mainFuture</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>poll</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>mainFuture</span><span>,</span> <span>ctx</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>POLL_READY</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>exit</span><span>(</span><span>EXIT_SUCCESS</span><span>);</span> <span>// Finished!</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>will suffice.
Polling the future once at startup will then kick off the machinery.</p>

<p>For a libuv timer future, we would want to write something like</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>TimerStatus</span> <span>{</span> <span>TIMER_NOT_STARTED</span><span>,</span> <span>TIMER_WAITING</span><span>,</span> <span>TIMER_FINISHED</span> <span>};</span>

<p>The timer handle is made to hold a reference to the future in
its user data field,
so that the callback knows which future to toggle the status on.
However this requires the future object to be pinned in memory,
moving it would make the reference dangling.
Rust deals with this unsafety using the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/pin/index.html">Pin construct</a>,
that wraps a pointer type, <code>P</code>,
and only permits operations that cannot move the pointee
(for cases where it may not always be safe to do so, i.e. <code>P: !Unpin</code>)
and ensures its memory remains valid until it gets dropped,
or helps make manually vetted code <em>nonleaky</em>.
In C there is no such thing;
the closest you will get is with a red paragraph buried in the documentation.
This means treading with care,
allocating storage for the main future once and never copying it, and
only referring to futures with pointers to their static place in memory.</p>

<p>Note that it is possible to get by with just one global <code>uv_timer_t</code>
by recognizing that whenever the main future is awoken either:
(I) A timer, necessarily the one with smallest timeout, fired;
or (II) All timers need be dropped and reset, since the futures form a tree,
as we will see.</p>

<h2 id="after-you">After you</h2>

<p>Running multiple futures sequentially is just a matter of
constructing a new future that polls each future to completion,
one after the other.
The poll method of the outer future will have to return <code>POLL_PENDING</code>
after each intermediate step,
before continuing where it left off - like a coroutine.
Rust turns each future into a state machine,
and doing the same in C means playing the part of the Rust compiler.
An adaptation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device">Duff’s device</a>,
as <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html">described by Simon Tatham</a>,
can help cut down on the boilerplate.
The idea is that with a <code>switch</code> statement enveloping the whole function-body,
you can yield by creating a unique label using the <code>__LINE__</code> macro
where execution will begin upon reentry,
setting the switch-expression as such, and returning.
The following macros do just that</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>Coroutine</span><span>;</span>

<span>#define COR_START(s) switch (*(s)) { case 0:;
#define COR_YIELD(s, r) do {*(s) = __LINE__; return (r); case __LINE__:;} while(0)
#define COR_END }
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>where <code>s</code> is a pointer to the coroutine state.
Great care has to be taken because when returning all locals are invalidated -
if only there was a language that could statically check for such mistakes.
Awaiting then becomes</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#define AWAIT(s, ctx, fut) while ((fut)-&gt;poll((fut), (ctx)) == POLL_PENDING) \
	COR_YIELD((s), POLL_PENDING)
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>that is, yielding until the given future is resolved.</p>

<p>To illustrate, here is a future that prints four times to standard output,
first thrice at one second intervals, and then again after two more seconds:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>TestFuture</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Note that the local <code>i</code> had to be spilled to the future struct
in order to persist across yield points,
and that unions are used to show what variables are active at each step,
and squeeze out that last driblet of performance even in the face of
uncompromising undefined behaviour threats from all directions.</p>

<h2 id="off-to-the-races">Off to the races</h2>

<p>In a similar vein, multiple futures can be made to run in parallel
using a future combinator whose poll method polls all of its children
and either waits for all to complete - <em>joins</em> them,
or selects the first to become ready.
The latter is a tad more difficult, so let us focus on that.
The reason is that after the first future has resolved,
the rest may still be running, their memory possibly referenced elsewhere.
This is where the <code>drop()</code> method that we have skimmed over comes in.
Dropping a pinned object should relax the constraint
that its memory remains valid.
The drop implementation of <code>TimerFuture</code> above could for example
call <code>uv_timer_stop()</code> so the callback never fires
or overwrite the dangling reference to the future with <code>NULL</code>.
For other types, since their drop implementations are …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

Selling software to the enterprise is hard, rewarding, and nothing like this movie.</p>

<p>The enterprise SaaS industry is booming. Much has been written about how to scale B2C tech, as consumer technology companies such as Google, Facebook, or Netflix enjoy near-monopolies, employ hordes of people, and command appropriately dominant mindshare. A relative lack of material has been written about building enterprise software, particularly from a product &amp; engineering point of view.</p>

<p>In this post series we’ll describe techniques on building an easily sellable SaaS product. To set the stage, we’ll define “enterprise buyers” as companies that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Employ 500+ people</li>
  <li>Are prepared to pay around $100,000 or (much) more for strategic products</li>
  <li>Regularly make long-term, multi-year software buying commitments</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="enterprise-sales-is-like-marriage">Enterprise Sales is Like Marriage</h2>

<p>SaaS covers a wide spectrum of businesses: from enterprise products that cost tens of millions of dollars over multiple years, to freemium products that start at $10/month. The strategies that help you sell one will not (typically) work for the other. The process of settling on the former product is like getting married: months to years building the relationship, multiple suitors, and meetings with the parents, all with the intention of making a decades long commitment. Buying a $150/year utility SaaS, by comparison, is like a Tinder date that ends with getting busy in the back of a Prius.</p>

<p>Once you see the similarities between enterprise buying and marriage, many dimensions of how to sell high-value SaaS become more clear:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Like a marriage, it’s important to have integrity. Don’t oversell – put your best foot forward (brush your teeth before the first date!) but have integrity in how you sell yourself (don’t lie about your job, your height, or where you went to school).</li>
  <li>You need to offer something differentiated. Nobody wants to settle – you need to be the best catch in at least one, and preferably multiple important dimensions.</li>
  <li>There are a lot of stakeholders. “Meeting the parents” is a key step in serious dating; meeting your buyer’s Procurement and Infosec teams can be a (disturbingly) similar experience.</li>
  <li>You need to be the right partners for each other. Enterprise sales relies upon product/<strong>customer</strong> fit – you should solve a need for your buyer, and you should be able to actually deliver. A common example: over-selling to a Fortune 500 company as a 40-person company, when you don’t have the stability, maturity, or headcount to deliver the service that they expect. Maybe you all are just meeting at the wrong moment in your lives.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I began my career I didn’t understand this dynamic at all. I imagined that enterprise sales was like trying to meet someone at a bar: look as hot as possible, go to a few steak dinners, dance poorly and hope for the best. Superficial stuff. In reality, building a product that can sell to big-company buyers requires scoring well across a broad constellation of factors: the equivalents of getting a good education, having a steady job, and demonstrating that you know how to clean your apartment. Enterprise buyers expect to be courted, and as a builder you have the tools to put your best foot forward.</p>

<h2 id="the-anatomy-of-an-enterprise-sale">The Anatomy of an Enterprise Sale</h2>

<p>These posts on how to sell to the enterprise are rooted in the core drivers that impact huge software purchases. Understanding these drivers as a product builder can help you navigate the arcane “dating” process behind closing your first (or next) enterprise logo:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spending millions of dollars on a software solution is necessarily a complex process due to the sheer amount of “stuff” going on at a large company.</li>
  <li>Enterprise software deployments have a complex web of stakeholders. The buyer of enterprise software is often different from the user, as software is (often) bought by executives but used by their teams. Decisions on which vendors to use can take on a political dimension, as they can make or break careers.</li>
  <li>Change is <em>extremely</em> expensive to enterprise buyers because they’re massive and built for momentum over agility. Like a battleship, they can carry a lot of people very far but are a pain to turn. Enterprise companies value stability, and they want to commit upfront to a long-term partner.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this series, we’ll discuss strategies for building a product that will sell to the enterprise, and that will keep them happy for years. Following posts will break down strategies we’ve found helpful, and hopefully provide some ideas as you develop your own products.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Building a product that can sell to the enterprise is difficult but rewarding.</li>
  <li>Enterprise sales is like dating with intent to marry, with many of the same dynamics.</li>
  <li>Enterprise buyers’ decision-making is influenced by several important drivers: the complexity of enterprise businesses, complicated webs of stakeholders, and the need to plan on long time horizons.</li>
</ul>

  <p>
    Tracking position of something is a topic that I like, cause it makes me
    feel like to be a human with a sixth sense. With this sense I know where an
    object is and how it moves, in spite of&nbsp; I can't see the object
    directly with my naked eyes. Then how do we get a sixth sense? Because as
    ordinary human we only have five senses.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    In my opinion, living in this digital age today, we already had a sixth
    sense which is called technology that implemented in an application. Related
    with our topic in this post about flight tracking, there are numerous flight
    tracking applications out there such as flightradar24, FlightAware,
    flightview and so on, which enabled us to monitor position of airplanes
    around the earth. This post won't discuss about those applications, moreover
    I will discuss how to make our own flight tracking application with
    python.&nbsp; <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously I already posted two tutorials about flight tracking with python.
    The first one is about
    <a href="https://www.geodose.com/2018/11/create-simple-live-flight-tracking-python.html">creating a simple flight tracking application with python</a>
    and the another one is
    <a href="https://www.geodose.com/2019/01/realtime-flight-tracking-pandas-bokeh-python.html">creating a flight tracking application with pandas and bokeh</a>. What is the difference with this one? The main difference is data source.
    In those two previous posts, I used
    <a href="https://www.adsbexchange.com/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ADS-B Exchange</a>
    and in this tutorial I'm using
    <a href="https://opensky-network.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Opensky Network</a>. Another difference is module version. In this tutorial I'm using the
    latest version python library in particular for plotting library. So there
    will be a slight change in the code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Enough for introduction. Now let's move to our main topic how to build a
    flight tracking application with python using open air traffic data. This
    tutorial consists of several sub-topics, there are: Getting data, importing
    required libraries, loading basemap, plotting aircraft's position and make a
    "realtime" flight tracking application. We will discuss each part, and at
    the end of this tutorial we will get a flight tracking application which is
    running in a browser as shown in figure 1.

</div><h3>Getting Air Traffic Data

<ins data-ad-client="ca-pub-5632482621101280" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-slot="7655392618"></ins>
</h3>
<p>
  As I mentioned earlier, in this tutorial we are using open air traffic data
  from OpenSky Network. OpenSky Network is an non-profit consortium that
  provides open air traffic data to the public in particular for research and
  non-commercial purposes. The data can be accessed through REST API, Python API
  and Java API. In this tutorial we will use REST API to retrieve the live air
  traffic data.
</p>
<p>
  To retrieve the data using REST API can be done using request operation. There
  are two types of requests can be used. The first one is request for specific
  airplane based on time in UNIX timestamp or ICAO24 address. The second one we
  can get all airplane data within an area extent using WGS84 coordinates
  system. Moreover the access for the data can be done anonymously or registered
  user. For anonymously request, it has 10 seconds resolution and 5 seconds for
  registered user. <br>
</p>
<p>
  In this tutorial we will use the second one. We will define an area extent
  with minimum and maximum coordinates, and then send the query to get all
  airplane data within the area. For example we want to fetch the data over United States
  with minimum coordinate -125.974,30.038 and maximum coordinate -68.748,52.214. The query for both anonymously and registered user will be as follow.
</p>
<pre><span>#</span>Anonymously Request
https:<span>//</span>opensky<span>-</span>network.org<span>/</span>api<span>/</span>states<span>/</span><span>all</span><span>?</span>lamin<span>=30.038</span><span>&amp;</span>lomin<span>=-125.974</span><span>&amp;</span>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>lamax<span>=52.214</span><span>&amp;</span>lomax<span>=-68.748</span><span></span>

<span>#</span>Registered User Request
https:<span>//</span>username:password<span>@</span>opensky<span>-</span>network.org<span>/</span>api<span>/</span>states<span>/</span><span>all</span><span>?</span>lamin<span>=</span><span>30.038</span><span>&amp;</span>lomin<span>=-125.974</span><span>&amp;</span>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>lamax<span>=52.214</span><span>&amp;</span>lomax<span>=</span><span>-68.748</span><span></span></pre>
<p>
  Before continuing reading and to make sure the query is right, let's try it.
  Copy the anonymously query and paste into a browser. If you get a response
  like figure 2 below, then it works.&nbsp; <br>
</p>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
  The return response as shown in figure 2 is in JSON structure with two keys.
  The first one is <i>time </i>and the second one is <i>States</i> that contains
  data for each airplane in a list array. The list array stores many data such
  as: ICAO24 address, airplane call sign, origin country, time position, last
  contact, longitude, latitude, barometer altitude and so on. For complete
  explanation about the data response and also further information about OpenSky
  Network API please refer to
  <a href="https://www.geodose.com/2020/08/OpenSky%20Network%20API" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OpenSky Network API Documentation</a>. &nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<h3>Getting Air Traffic Data in Python</h3>

<p>
  We already retrieved the traffic data using REST API in a browser. Now let's
  do it in Python and process the response for the next purpose. For this
  tutorial I'm using Jupyter notebook with Python 3.8.2 and some libraries such
  as Bokeh 2.1.1, Pandas 0.25.3, requests, json and numpy. <br>
</p>
<p>
  Below is the code to make a request and do a little processing on the
  data. At the beginning, we import the required libraries such as requests,
  json and Pandas. Then define the extent coordinate in WGS84 with respective
  variable <i>lon_min,lat_min, lon_max and lat_max</i>.&nbsp; Based on the
  extent coordinate, make the request query. If you are a registered user, give
  the user name and password in <i>user_name</i> and <i>password</i> variable at
  line 11-12. Based on given extent coordinate and user data, we create a
  request query in <i>url_data</i> variable as in line 13 and get the response
  in json format. The remain of the code is used to dump the response data into
  Pandas data frame and replace the blank/empty data with 'NaN' value with 'No
  Data'. The last line which is data frame's <i>head</i> method is used to view
  the first 5 top row of the data as shown in figure 3. &nbsp;

&nbsp;
<p>Make sure after executing the code, you have a result as in figure 3. If you
  get it, it means everything is fine, and we have the data that will be used
  for the next step.</p><h3>Plotting Airplane on the Map</h3>
<p>
  After getting the data, now let's plot the location of all airplanes on a
  map.&nbsp; For plotting purpose, we are using Bokeh library. Therefore we need
  to import the library first. Additionally we also need to import NumPy library
  that will be used in coordinate conversion.
</p>
<p>
  The conversion of coordinate system is implemented in a function which is
  called <i>wgs84_web_mercator</i>_. As it's name this function will be used to
  transform WGS84 coordinate into web Mercator coordinate system. This
  transformation is required because we are using a
  <i>STAMEN_TERRAIN</i> basemap in a web browser that has web Mercator
  projection (EPSG: 3857).
</p>
<p>
  After creating coordinate conversion function and perform the transformation
  for data frame and extent coordinates. Next we set up plotting figure settings
  by specifying plotting area extent based on the range of x and y coordinates.
  The aircraft will be plotted on the basemap based on x and y coordinates with
  Points and also with airplane icon image. Why both point and image are used to plot
  the aircraft? Image will give a better visualization by using an airplane
  image and it can be rotated with the respective track angle. But unfortunately it
  can't&nbsp; high light a selected object and display more information with
  hover tool. To overcome this issue we use both image and point in circle
  object to get nice a visualization and enable selection and hovering tool.
  &nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>
  The following is the code until this step. If it is
  executed we will get a result as in figure 4.&nbsp; <br>

<section>
    
    <small>Published on 28. August 2020</small>
    <p>You can find a lot of articles about how to prevent deadlocks in Go, but most of them focus on concurrency patterns and synchronization tools like mutexes. While it is important to know some techniques to prevent them, a trap you can stumble across more easily without noticing, are database transaction deadlocks.</p><p>A transaction deadlock can occur when you start one or more transactions and run queries outside of transactions while they are still active. If you run too many transactions and queries at the same time, you might run out of database connections in the connection pool. Here is a simple example of that:</p><pre><code language="text/x-go">// We will ignore errors for this example,
// you should always check them of course.

tx, _ := db.Begin()
tx.Exec(`INSERT INTO "foo" ("a", "b") VALUES (4, 2)`)

// ...

db.Query(`SELECT * FROM "foo" WHERE "a" = $1 AND "b" = $2`, 4, 2)

// DEADLOCK

tx.Commit()</code></pre><p>In this example, we create a new transaction and insert something to the database. Later on, we try to query the same result from the database. That the inserted row has not been committed yet, is not the actual issue, as you would receive no result in that case. The real issue here is that if you run this code concurrently, you might run out of connections. How many connections are opened to the database can be configured. As soon as your code reaches the <code>db.Query</code> the last connection might be occupied by the transaction and therefore blocks until a connection is available, which might never happen.</p><p>So how do you fix this? First of all, all queries should be run either outside or inside a transaction for a specific part of your code. Even if you run a transaction block and a non-transaction block concurrently, the non-transaction block will not be blocked by the transaction forever (but the non-transaction block might need to wait for the other part to finish). Additionally, you can use a linter or another tool to make sure all queries are run completely inside or outside of transactions.</p><p>I usually write integration tests against the database. If you do the same, you can configure the connection pool size to make sure the tests will only use a single connection. That way the tests will run into a deadlock should you have forgotten to use a transaction somewhere. You can easily configure that inside the <code>TestMain</code> function for a package.</p><pre><code language="text/x-go">func TestMain(m *testing.M) {
	db.SetMaxOpenConns(1) // db is the *sql.DB created somewhere
}</code></pre><p>I hope this helps you to prevent some nasty deadlock bugs. I found quite a few in a larger code base by limiting the connection pool. In production, you should use multiple connections to speed up things of course.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Also, this series is going to come off as if I dislike WebAssembly. I love WebAssembly! I wrote a <a href="http://troubles.md/why-wasm/">whole article about how great it is</a>! In fact, I love it so much that I want it to be the best that it can be, and this series is me working through my complaints with the design in the hope that some or all of these issues can be addressed soon, while the ink is still somewhat wet on the specification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m sure you’re all familiar with WebAssembly by now. It’s seeing use everywhere, from plugins to blockchain smart contracts to, of course, the web. If you go to the Wikipedia article for WebAssembly right now, you’ll get a great overview of the technology, except for one thing: the “Design” section states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WebAssembly code is intended to be run on a portable abstract structured stack machine</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope.</p>
<h2 id="stack-machines-vs-register-machines">Stack machines vs register machines</h2>
<p>The difference between a stack and a register machine is essentially this: a stack machine pops values from and pushed values onto a stack, so for example a <code>+</code> operation will pop the last two values off of the stack, add them together, and then push the result back onto the stack. A register machine has some number of places where values can be stored, and operations reads and writes to those registers. So <code>+</code> will take 3 arguments, 2 that represent the registers to read the operands from and 1 that represents the register to write the result to<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The problem with registers is that there is no liveness analysis. If you have some code like so:</p>
<pre><code>%0 = 1
%1 = 2
%2 = add %0, %1
...
</code></pre><p>Are <code>%0</code> and <code>%1</code> used after the addition? Without lookahead, you have no way of knowing. Even in SSA<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> register machines like LLVM IR (where each register is written to exactly once) the liveness of each register must be continuously recalculated. This means that you have overhead associated with compilation - knowing the liveness of variables is extremely important for generating efficient assembly, but instead of the liveness being calculated when creating the IR and stored as a part of it you have to recalculate this data every time.</p>
<p>If the IR is entirely in-memory this isn’t so bad, especially if your code is in SSA form, but it means that you have to do extra work for the same quality of code and it means that a streaming compiler (like FireFox’s Wasm baseline compiler) is unable to produce good code.</p>
<p>You can, of course, add liveness analysis metadata to the machine, but that liveness analysis is only useful if your code is in SSA form - if it’s not SSA form then the liveness is <em>extremely</em> coarse-grained.</p>
<p>Well, that’s where WebAssembly comes in. See, WebAssembly has these things called locals. Locals are mutable variables that live for the lifetime of a function. Since WebAssembly blocks can’t take arguments, they’re the only way for blocks to receive data from outside. This includes stuff like loop counters, the classic example for SSA-defeating mutable variables, but it also includes regular blocks. For example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="lisp"><span>(</span><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>result</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>add</span> <span>(</span><span>i32.const</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>i32.const</span> <span>2</span><span>))</span>
  <span>(</span><span>block</span> <span>(</span><span>result</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span>
    <span>; Can't read the result of the add above</span>
  <span>))</span>
</code></pre></div><p>You have to do this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="lisp"><span>(</span><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>result</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>local</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>local.set</span> <span>0</span> <span>(</span><span>add</span> <span>(</span><span>i32.const</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>i32.const</span> <span>2</span><span>)))</span>
  <span>(</span><span>block</span> <span>(</span><span>result</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span><span>local.get</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
  <span>))</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This is a problem. Usually a stack machine can be trivially converted to SSA form with liveness analysis - an item on the stack is dead when it is used as the argument to an operator - no ifs, no buts. Even a <code>pick</code> operator<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> can be thought of in these terms as long as the argument to <code>pick</code> is a compile-time constant, although generally the SSA conversion of a stack machine that includes a <code>pick</code> instruction would be implemented using refcounting - meaning that reading a variable doesn’t involve creating an unnecessary new one. However, locals are a problem. They’re mutable, so you can’t trivially convert them to SSA, and they always live for the lifetime of the function.</p>
<p>This poses a problem for optimisation. SSA form is one of the most powerful optimisation tools. The fact that locals are mutable defeats that, and the fact that they’re global to the function defeats liveness analysis. For an example of why this is an issue, say you’re trying to compile WebAssembly into some native architecture. You’ll compile your code into one that uses some number of arguments in registers, but now unless you do your own liveness analysis on that function those registers are permanently marked “in use” by those arguments. Without extra analysis you don’t know when the last usage of that argument is, and so you can’t ever reuse the register used by that argument for something else. Even a function that never uses any of its arguments still can’t reuse the space used by those arguments for anything else.</p>
<p>This essentially makes WebAssembly a register machine without liveness analysis, but not only that, it’s a register machine that isn’t even in SSA form - both of the tools at our disposal to do optimisation are unavailable. In a true, optimising compiler we can recreate that information, but WebAssembly was already emitted by a compiler that generated that information once. There’s no technical reason why we should have to do that work again, it’s just a deficiency in the language. A compiler that has to act on a stream of WebAssembly has less ability to recreate this information and will end up generating significantly worse code for essentially no good reason.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>The developers of the WebAssembly spec aren’t dumb. For the most part it’s an extremely well-designed specification. However, they are weighed down by WebAssembly’s legacy. WebAssembly started out not as a bytecode, but more like a simplified binary representation for asm.js. Essentially it was originally designed to be source code, like JavaScript. It would be a more-efficient representation thereof but it still wasn’t a proper virtual machine instruction set. Then, it became a register machine<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, and only at the last minute did it switch to stack-based encoding for the operators. At that point, concepts like locals were quite entrenched in the spec. Not only that, but for the most part the WebAssembly specification team were flying blind. No streaming compiler had yet been built, hell, no compiler had yet been built. It wasn’t clear that having locals would be problematic - after all, C gets by just fine using local variables that the compiler constructs the SSA graph for.</p>
<p>It’s only by working on a streaming WebAssembly compiler for integration with <a href="https://github.com/CraneStation/wasmtime">Wasmtime</a> that I realised these issues, as well as more issues that I’ll get to in later articles in this series. Before then I considered WebAssembly’s design to be utterly rock-solid, and in fact I still strongly believe that most of the decisions made were the right ones. Although it has problems, it’s incredible how much the WebAssembly working group got right considering it was such relatively unknown territory at the time of the specification’s writing.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-alternative">What’s the alternative?</h2>
<p>So currently locals represent both function arguments and local variables. There is <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/multi-value/blob/master/proposals/multi-value/Overview.md">a proposal to allow blocks to have arguments and both functions and blocks to return more than one value</a>. With this, it becomes possible to get rid of locals entirely. Loop counters are implemented by having the counter be given as an argument, and then when you jump to the header of the loop you must have the new value of the counter on the stack. This acts like a phi function but is much conceptually simpler. Since it’s impossible to get the address of locals in WebAssembly there’s no need for <code>alloca</code> in any form - unlike in LLVM, you don’t need to have locals at all. The only thing left is to implement function arguments by having the function start with its arguments on the stack and you no longer need locals at all.</p>
<p>This massively reduces the complexity of the WebAssembly specification and compilers for it without reducing the expressivity, and allows the compilers generating the WebAssembly to encode more of their knowledge about the original source into the WebAssembly itself. Although optimising compilers will probably not generate better code from this, they will become much simpler and easier to maintain, and streaming compilers will become significantly simpler and produce significantly better code.</p>
<p>Finally, not only is a stack machine like this automatically in SSA form, but it’s automatically in <em>strict</em> SSA form. This means that it is statically impossible to access undefined variables. In WebAssembly as it exists now, you have to zero locals when entering a function unless you can statically prove that the local is always set before it is accessed. Again, the compilers almost always have this information, and removing locals makes accessing undefined memory statically impossible.</p>
<p>Join me next time where I tackle WebAssembly’s problematic control flow.</p>

  <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3a8e939667e3734b84dff063fff3965fe824553c/d7922/uploads/good-names.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>In <a href="https://toolbox.humandeluxe.com/2020/08/07/how-to-name">this video</a>, I walked you through our naming process. We usually work in a workshop format to create a long list of potential brand names for our clients. This can be done either remote or onsite. If you’ve missed this it the last time, make sure you watch the video first:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="420" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T8Hlbp8mp_I?color=white&amp;theme=light"></iframe>

<p>Once we have the long list of names, how do we make the selection? How do we distinguish between good and bad brand names?</p>

<p>The process is twofold: On the one side, we need too identify good brand names, on the other side we need to exclude all the bad names. So let’s look at the first part: How do you create a good brand name?</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-brand-name">What makes a good brand name?</h2>

<p>At Human Deluxe, we follow the teachings of Alexandra Watkins, who created the SMILE &amp; SCRATCH principles: Good names make you smile, bad names leave you scratch your head. Of course, these are Acronyms, so let’s look at how to make yourself SMILE with a good name:</p>

<p>The qualities of a good name:</p>

<p><strong>Suggestive</strong>: A good name will give you a hint of a positive brand experience. It will suggest the rest of the brand for you. Great examples of this are travel company KAYAK or streaming service Pandora: Once you open the streaming box, it would not stop playing – clever, right?</p>

<p><strong>Meaningful</strong> A good name resonates with your target audience. Not only do they feel good, but they already know what to expect. Obvious examples of this are domain provider Namecheap, diet drink Slimfast or even good old Facebook.</p>

<p><strong>Imagery</strong> A great name is visually evocative. It creates a picture in your head that people will instantly associate with your brand. Even if a name is abstract, it will be able to give your audience a certain association and idea of what it could look like. Think of brands like: Caterpilar or Citibank – these are great examples.</p>

<p><strong>Legs</strong> Like a good hiker, a great name has strong legs. It lends itself to a theme for extra mileage: A name with great legs can shine through to the whole brand, directing the tonality and vocabulary. Personally, I like how twitter worked that in: A single microblogpost is a Tweet, the logo is a bird, even certain icons would be bird-themed, like the birdhouse Home button or the egg avatar.</p>

<p><strong>Emotional</strong> A good brand name moves people. does not only work in their mind, it touches their heart. This works for both B2C and B2B companies. Business brands don’t have to be boring. In fact, they can swing up to greater heights if they have an emotional impact, distinguishing themselves from their dull competition. Brands that are brave enough to be emotional do connect with humans like no other. Take Yahoo! or Greenpeace for example – it works.</p>

<p>If you want to figure out if your brand is good, your name for these criterias. At best, a good name ticks all of them. At least, your name should check one or two criterias. At any cost, avoid head scratchers names. In our next article, we will explain what these are and how you identify them. Sign up for our newsletter to get this article earlier than everybody else, as well as the free name checker template.</p>

<p>One of the major challenges of writing a journal article is to keep track of versions - both the different versions you create as the document progresses, and to merge in the changes made by your collaborators. For most academics Microsoft Word is the default writing tool, and it is both very good and very bad in this. Very good because the <em>track changes</em> feature makes it easy to see what has changed since the last version and who made the changes. Very bad because this feature is built around keeping everything in a single Word document, so that only one person can work on on a manuscript at a time. This usually means sending manuscripts around by email, and being very careful about not confusing different versions of the document, which requires <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531">creativity</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>Approaches to overcome these challenges are to a) integrate the Word documents into collaboration tools such as Sharepoint and Office 365, or document sharing services such as Dropbox and Google Docs (if you use it just for that), or b) use a different authoring tool altogether. If neither of these approaches works for you, you have a third option: use the version control system <strong>git</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mulvany.net/presentations/WikimaniaOpenScholarshipTalk.slides.html#/3">Git</a> is software that helps with <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/2014/08/25/using-microsoft-word-with-git/(http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)">tracking changes to files</a> so that you can recall specific versions later. Git is typically used to track changes of software source code (and was originally developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005), but in fact git can be used for any file where we need to keep track of versions over time. Git is open source software that runs locally on your computer, so please go ahead and start tracking changes to your manuscripts (or other complex documents) with git. Any time you want to store a version, do a <code>git commit</code> with a little description and an optional tag.</p>
<p>This approach is not ideal, as git was written with source code in text format in mind and for example doesn’t understand what has changed between two revisions of a Word document. Some people will tell you to never store binary files in a version control system, but don’t listen to them. Instead give git a tool to convert Word documents into plain text, and git will then happily tell you what has changed between revisions. Several tools can do this, but since earlier this month Pandoc can read Word documents in <code>docx</code> format. Do the following to have Pandoc convert Word documents into markdown, and to compare the revisions by word and not by line (which makes more sense):</p>
<pre><code># .gitattributes file in root folder of your git project
*.docx diff=pandoc</code></pre>
<pre><code># .gitconfig file in your home folder
[diff "pandoc"]
  textconv=pandoc --to=markdown
  prompt = false
[alias]
  wdiff = diff --word-diff=color --unified=1</code></pre>
<p>You can then use <code>git wdiff important_file.docx</code> to see the changes (with deletions in red and insertions in green), or <code>git log -p --word-diff=color important_file.docx</code> to see all changes over time.</p>
<p>While you can now track revisions of a Word document and see the changes, you also want to be able to merge different versions of a Word document together so that you and your collaborators can work on the manuscript in parallel. Git can’t merge binary files together, so you need to first convert the Word document into a format that git understands. Just as in the previous example we can use Pandoc for that, with markdown as the textual format. This would also work with HTML or LaTeX, but the simplicity of markdown makes it better suited for version control which doesn’t know about the markup of these formats.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that git became so popular with software developers is that it is a <strong>distributed version control system</strong> instead of a centralized system such as Subversion. This means that you can track all revisions locally on your computer, but can still synchronize your revisions with another user. <strong>Github</strong> is a popular service that facilitates this synchronization and adds some nice features on top. One way to collaborate with your co-authors is therefore to set up a Github repository (public or private) for your manuscript, and store the master version of the manuscript in markdown format. Instead of working on the master version directly, you would use Pandoc to convert back and forth between this master version in markdown format and your Word document, and would continue to use Word as authoring tool. <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/2014/08/18/introducing-rakali/">Rakali</a> is a Pandoc tool that I released last week that can help automate this document conversion. Github has a a number of features to facilitate collaboration that can be used here, e.g.&nbsp;Github issues for discussion and task management.</p>
<p>There are still a few rough edges in the workflow described above (e.g.&nbsp;only partial support of Word track changes), but it is an interesting approach to collaborate using Microsoft Word and git. And this workflow can of course be enhanced to also include authors that write in LaTeX or one of the other formats that Pandoc supports. One nice side effect of using markdown is that Github will automatically render a webpage for the document (which it will not do for HTML without extra effort).</p>

August 28, 2020 | https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/defmt/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/defmt/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today we are thrilled to announce the public release of <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/defmt"><code>defmt</code></a> ("de format").
<code>defmt</code> stands for "deferred formatting" and it's a highly efficient logging framework.
As we covered in <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/21st-century-embedded-tooling/">our blog post about embedded tooling for the 21st century</a> we hope <code>defmt</code> will serve as the base for features like data visualization and interactive logging front-ends.
In this post we'll cover how to use <code>defmt</code> with <code>probe-rs</code> supported devices and what you can do with <code>defmt</code> today.</p>



<p>We have created a <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template">Cargo project template</a> to make the setup easier.
Here are the setup steps.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install the <strong>git</strong> version of <code>probe-run</code>, <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/probe-run/">a custom Cargo runner that lets you run embedded apps if they were native apps</a>. Be sure to enable the <code>defmt</code> Cargo feature!</li>
</ol>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo install <span>\</span>
    <span>--git</span> https://github.com/knurling-rs/probe-run <span>\</span>
    <span>--branch</span> main <span>\</span>
    <span>--features</span> defmt
</code></pre></div>
<ol>
  <li>Either initialize the project template with <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-generate"><code>cargo-generate</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template/archive/master.zip">fetch a copy</a> and initialize the <code>Cargo.toml</code> manually.</li>
</ol>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo generate <span>\</span>
    <span>--git</span> https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template <span>\</span>
    <span>--branch</span> main <span>\</span>
    <span>--name</span> my-app
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you are not using <code>cargo-generate</code> you'll need to manually enter the <code>author</code> and <code>name</code> fields in <code>Cargo.toml</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code> # Cargo.toml
 [package]
<span>-# authors = ["{{authors}}"]
-# name = "{{project-name}}"
</span><span>+name = "my-app"
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After that there are a few TODOs in the template.
You can <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep"><code>ripgrep</code></a> for the word TODO (<code>rg TODO .cargo .</code>) to find them but we'll walk you through all of them in this blog post.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Pick a chip from <code>probe-run --list-chips</code> and enter it into <code>.cargo/config.toml</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>If, for example, you have a nRF52840 Development Kit from one of <a href="https://github.com/ferrous-systems/embedded-trainings-2020">our workshops</a> then replace <code>{{chip}}</code> with <code>nRF52840_xxAA</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code> # .cargo/config.toml
 [target.'cfg(all(target_arch = "arm", target_os = "none"))']
<span>-runner = "probe-run --chip {{chip}} --defmt"
</span><span>+runner = "probe-run --chip nRF52840_xxAA --defmt"
</span></code></pre></div>
<ol>
  <li>Adjust the compilation target in <code>.cargo/config.toml</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the nRF52840 chip you'll want to use the <code>thumbv7em-none-eabihf</code> target.</p>

<div><pre><code> # .cargo/config.toml
 [build]
<span>-target = "thumbv6m-none-eabi"    # Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M0+
-# target = "thumbv7m-none-eabi"    # Cortex-M3
-# target = "thumbv7em-none-eabi"   # Cortex-M4 and Cortex-M7 (no FPU)
-# target = "thumbv7em-none-eabihf" # Cortex-M4F and Cortex-M7F (with FPU)
</span><span>+target = "thumbv7em-none-eabihf" # Cortex-M4F (with FPU)
</span></code></pre></div>
<ol>
  <li>Add a HAL as a dependency.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the nRF52840 you'll want to use the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/nrf52840-hal"><code>nrf52840-hal</code></a>.</p>

<div><pre><code> # Cargo.toml
 [dependencies]
<span>-# some-hal = "1.2.3"
</span><span>+nrf52840-hal = "0.11.0"
</span></code></pre></div>
<ol>
  <li>Now that you have selected a HAL fix the HAL import in <code>src/lib.rs</code></li>
</ol>

<div><pre><code> // my-app/src/lib.rs
<span>-// use some_hal as _; // memory layout
</span><span>+use nrf52840_hal as _; // memory layout
</span></code></pre></div>


<p>You are now all set to <code>cargo-run</code> your first <code>defmt</code>-powered application!
There are some examples in the <code>src/bin</code> directory.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// my-app/src/bin/hello.rs</span>

<span>#</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>no_main</span><span>]</span>
<span>#</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>no_std</span><span>]</span>

<span>use</span> <span>my_app</span> <span>as</span> <span>_</span><span>;</span> <span>// global logger + panicking-behavior + memory layout</span>

<span>#[cortex_m_rt</span><span>::</span><span>entry]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>!</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>info!</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, world!"</span><span>);</span>

    <span>my_app</span><span>::</span><span>exit</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><code>cargo run</code>-ning this program produces the classic "Hello, world!" output.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span># `rb` is an alias for `run --bin`</span>
<span>$</span> cargo rb hello
<span>    Finished dev [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.03s
flashing program ..
DONE
resetting device
0.000000 INFO Hello, world!
(..)

</span><span>$</span> <span>echo</span> <span>$?</span>
<span>0
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Or if you are using VS code + Rust-Analyzer, instead, you can open the <code>src/bin/hello.rs</code> file and <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/run-rust-on-your-embedded-device-from-vscode/">click the "Run" button as we demonstrated in a previous blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Now let's take a closer look at the features of the framework.
This post will be a quick overview.
For more details check out <a href="https://defmt.ferrous-systems.com/">the <code>defmt</code> book</a>.</p>



<p>We have wired the <code>panic_handler</code> to <code>defmt</code> to make panicking much cheaper.
Consider this example, which is part of the project template:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// my-app/src/bin/panic.rs</span>

<span>#[cortex_m_rt</span><span>::</span><span>entry]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>!</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>info!</span><span>(</span><span>"main"</span><span>);</span>

    <span>panic!</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>It produces this output:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo rb panic
<span>0.000000 INFO main
0.000001 ERROR panicked at src/bin/panic.rs:11:5
stack backtrace:
   0: 0x00000554 - __bkpt

   7: 0x00000238 - ResetTrampoline
   8: 0x00000214 - Reset
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you may have seen from our previous posts with <code>probe-run</code> you get a stack backtrace for free!</p>

<h2 id="binary-size">Binary size</h2>

<p>What I wanted to highlight here is the binary size.
Here's the output of <code>cargo-size</code> (part of the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-binutils"><code>cargo-binutils</code></a> project).</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo size <span>--bin</span> panic <span>--</span> <span>-A</span>
<span>section              size        addr

.rodata               360       0x600
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>An here's the output of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-bloat"><code>cargo-bloat</code></a></p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo bloat <span>-n</span> 5 <span>--bin</span> panic

</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are <strong>no</strong> <code>core::fmt</code> function calls there and that's what makes the binary so small.</p>

<h2 id="vs-rprintln">vs <code>rprintln!</code></h2>

<p>Let's compare against a program that uses <a href="https://docs.rs/rtt-target/0.2.0/rtt_target/macro.rprintln.html"><code>rtt_target::rprintln</code></a>, which is hard-wired to <code>core::fmt</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#</span><span>[</span><span>cortex_m_rt</span><span>::</span><span>entry</span><span>]</span>

</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The biggest functions are <code>core::fmt</code> related.
The <code>defmt</code>-powered <code>panic</code> uses 1.59 KB of Flash (<code>.text</code> + <code>.rodata</code>); <code>panic-rprintln</code> uses 13.85 KB.
That's almost a whopping 9x savings.

<p><em>programs compiled with <code>-Oz</code> and <code>lto=fat</code></em></p>

<p>Now you can panic without reservation: panic messages are no longer binary-size expensive.
Also, no more need to reach out for crates that discard panic information, like <a href="https://crates.io/crates/panic-halt"><code>panic-halt</code></a>, to keep the binary size low.</p>



<p>If you have used the <code>log</code> crate before you know that it supports 5 logging levels: trace, debug, info, warn and error – sorted from lowest severity to highest.
<code>defmt</code> supports the same five levels through 5 logging macros: <code>trace!</code>, <code>debug!</code>, <code>info!</code>, <code>warn!</code> and <code>error!</code>.
Let's see them in action:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// my-app/src/bin/levels.rs</span>

<span>#[cortex_m_rt</span><span>::</span><span>entry]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>!</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>info!</span><span>(</span><span>"info"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>trace!</span><span>(</span><span>"trace"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>warn!</span><span>(</span><span>"warn"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>debug!</span><span>(</span><span>"debug"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>error!</span><span>(</span><span>"error"</span><span>);</span>

    <span>my_app</span><span>::</span><span>exit</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is the output:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo rb levels
<span>0.000000 INFO info
0.000001 TRACE trace
0.000002 WARN warn
0.000003 DEBUG debug
0.000004 ERROR error
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Not shown above but the logging level (e.g. INFO) gets nicely colored in the terminal output.</p>

<h2 id="filters">Filters</h2>

<p>The main reason for having logging levels is to be able to filter some of them out.
If we re-run the <code>levels</code> example but compile it using the <code>release</code> profile we get less output:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span># `rrb` is an alias for `run --release --bin`</span>
<span>$</span> cargo rrb levels
<span>0.000000 INFO info
0.000001 WARN warn
0.000002 ERROR error
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is because the project template has been configured to report all logging levels when the <code>dev</code> profile is used, but only INFO and higher severity logs when the <code>release</code> profile is used.</p>

<p><code>defmt</code> defaults to logging nothing (filtering everything out) but this behavior can be configured via Cargo features.</p>

<p>If you look at the project template's <code>Cargo.toml</code> you'll see that the <code>defmt-default</code> feature is enabled for the top crate (<code>my-app</code>):</p>

<div><pre><code><span>[features]</span>
<span>default</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>"defmt-default"</span><span>,</span>
<span># "dependency-a/defmt-trace",</span>
<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>defmt-default</code> behavior logs at TRACE level and higher severity if profile is <code>dev</code> and log INFO and up if profile is <code>release</code>.
The other features like <code>defmt-warning</code> enable logging at the specified level (WARN) and up regardless of the compilation profile (<code>dev</code> or <code>release</code>).</p>

<p>Logging filters can be configured per crate using Cargo features.
If you have used the <a href="https://docs.rs/env_logger/0.7.1/env_logger/"><code>env_logger</code></a> crate you may have used the <code>RUST_LOG</code> environment variable to enable logging in dependencies.
With <code>env_logger</code> you use <code>RUST_LOG=dep-a=debug,dep-b=info</code> to enable DEBUG logging in <code>dep-a</code> and INFO logging in <code>dep-b</code>.
With <code>defmt</code> that configuration is done in the top crate's <code>Cargo.toml</code> as shown below:</p>

<div><pre><code> # Cargo.toml
 [features]
 default = [
   "defmt-default",
<span>-# "dependency-a/defmt-trace",
</span><span>+  "dep-a/defmt-debug",
+  "dep-b/defmt-info",
</span> ]
</code></pre></div>


<p>So far we have only logged string literals in our examples but <code>defmt</code> also supports formatting arguments.
<code>core::write!</code> supports a variety of formatting parameters, each one associated to a formatting trait: <code>{:?}</code> (<code>Debug</code>), <code>{}</code> (<code>Display</code>), <code>{:x}</code> (<code>Hex</code>).
<code>defmt</code> has a single formatting trait: <code>Format</code>, which is associated to the <code>{:?}</code> formatting parameter.</p>

<p><code>{:?}</code> expects a type that implements the <code>Format</code> trait.
<code>Format</code> is implemented for primitives like integers and slices.
To implement <code>Format</code> for user-defined types (structs or enums) use the <code>#[derive(Format)]</code> attribute.</p>

<p>In addition to <code>{:?}</code>, there are formatting parameters for some primitives: e.g. <code>{:u8}</code>, <code>{:bool}</code>.
Prefer these parameters for primitives as they compress the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2>The Best Open Social Apps in 2021</h2><p>Open source software has become a big cultural phenomenon in recent years. Because its free in every sense of the word, its especially good for companies and groups that want to self host their software due to concerns over privacy and control. Other times open source solutions are chosen by those who simply want to have the freedom to use a consistent set of tools that are not tied to a single vendor. The only problem is that there is <i>so much of it</i>. It is hard to sort through it all. So to save you the trouble, we are sharing our picks about what we consider to be the best of the best open social software out there. Enjoy!</p><p>By the way we might have jumped the gun a bit with the title but 2021 is almost here. We're pretty sure these apps will stand the test of time. We use these apps ourselves every day, we have deployed them on behalf of our clients and we are confident they will remain highly competitive options throughout 2021, and if that changes we'll update this article. Good Luck!</p><p>If these apps aren't your cup of tea, we have good news. There are hundreds of other free social apps that you can search for on github.com. Content management systems, workflow tools, collaborative document editing, microblogging software and more. Have we missed anything important? Do you have any feedback or questions?</p> <p><a href="mailto:hi@opensocial.com">Let us know!</a></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>The IAM policy is the cornerstone of security of an AWS account. There is an oft-repeated notion of the shared responsibility model that stipulates that certain parts of security is the responsibility of the cloud provider, such as preventing malicious parties physical access to the infrastructure. On the other hand, the cloud provider gives you security controls and it is your responsibility to use them properly.</p> <p>The main security control is IAM and it is used everywhere inside AWS. With IAM you are not only able to create users for people who need access to the account but also to define what each user has access to.</p> <p>There are several types of policies, but the two most important ones are the identity-, and the resource-based policies. Whatever you do in your AWS account you’ll need to use these.</p> <h2 id="identity-based-policies">Identity-based policies</h2> <p>Identity-based policies are the easier of the two, as some variation of it is present in most systems. They <strong>define what an identity can do</strong>, such as a user has access to an S3 bucket.</p> <p>There are two types of identities in AWS: <strong>users and roles</strong>. By attaching a policy to an identity you can give it permissions to access resources. For example, you can attach this policy to allow a user to read an object in an S3 bucket:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
	</span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span>
	</span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
		</span><span>{</span><span>
			</span><span>"Action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
				</span><span>"s3:GetObject"</span><span>
			</span><span>],</span><span>
			</span><span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Allow"</span><span>,</span><span>
			</span><span>"Resource"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"arn:aws:s3:::&lt;bucket&gt;/text.txt"</span><span>
		</span><span>}</span><span>
	</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>Since the policy is attached to an identity, a user in this case, there is no Principal element in the policy. On the other hand, the Resource defines the object in the bucket that the user can access.</p> <p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" preserveAspectRatio="" style="width:384px;height:265px" viewBox="0 0 384 265"><defs><filter height="300%" id="prefix__a" width="300%" x="-1" y="-1"><feGaussianBlur result="blurOut" stdDeviation="2"></feGaussianBlur><feColorMatrix in="blurOut" result="blurOut2" values="0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 .4 0"></feColorMatrix><feOffset dx="4" dy="4" in="blurOut2" result="blurOut3"></feOffset><feBlend in="SourceGraphic" in2="blurOut3"></feBlend></filter></defs><ellipse cx="141" cy="18" fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" rx="8" ry="8" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="2.0"></ellipse><path d="M141 26v27m-13-19h26m-13 19l-13 15m13-15l13 15" fill="none" filter="url(#prefix__a)" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="2.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="31" x="125.5" y="87.995">user</text><path d="M241 37c0-10 34-10 34-10s34 0 34 10v25.297c0 10-34 10-34 10s-34 0-34-10V37" fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><path d="M241 37c0 10 34 10 34 10s34 0 34-10" fill="none" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="48" x="251" y="63.995">bucket</text><path fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" d="M51 152L51 228.891 231 228.891 231 162 221 152 51 152z" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><path d="M221 152v10h10" fill="#FEFECE" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="39" x="61" y="174.995">policy</text><path d="M52 178.297L230 178.297M52 180.297L230 180.297" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="144" x="67" y="195.292">Action: s3:GetObject</text><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="148" x="67" y="211.589">Resource: &lt;bucket&gt;</text><path d="M141 91.08v60.88" fill="none" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><path d="M156.63 49.5h78.95" fill="none" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><path fill="#A80036" d="M240.76 49.5L231.76 45.5 235.76 49.5 231.76 53.5 240.76 49.5z" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="13" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="48" x="174.75" y="42.567">Allowed</text><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="372" y="251.995">A policy attached to the user gives access to a bucket</text></svg> </p> <p>Note that groups are not identities but a way to attach policies to multiple users.</p> <h3 id="users">Users</h3> <p>There is only one type of user that can be created, but depending on how they are used we can distinguish <em>natural</em> and <em>technical</em> users.</p> <p>Natural users are created for people.

These type of users usually have a password to sign in to the console and sometimes access keys to allow programmatic access to the account. Since the user is created and managed by a single person, that person is responsible for it. Also, it’s likely that multiple people have the same job, so permissions are usually attached to groups instead of the users themselves.</p> <p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" preserveAspectRatio="" style="width:301px;height:387px" viewBox="0 0 301 387"><defs><filter height="300%" id="prefix__a" width="300%" x="-1" y="-1"><feGaussianBlur result="blurOut" stdDeviation="2"></feGaussianBlur><feColorMatrix in="blurOut" result="blurOut2" values="0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 .4 0"></feColorMatrix><feOffset dx="4" dy="4" in="blurOut2" result="blurOut3"></feOffset><feBlend in="SourceGraphic" in2="blurOut3"></feBlend></filter></defs><ellipse cx="96" cy="18" fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" rx="8" ry="8" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="2.0"></ellipse><path d="M96 26v27M83 34h26M96 53L83 68m13-15l13 15" fill="none" filter="url(#prefix__a)" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="2.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="28" x="82" y="87.995">Bob</text><path fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" d="M56 172.5H136V208.797H56z" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.5"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="60" x="66" y="195.495">IAM User</text><path d="M221 178c0-10 34-10 34-10s34 0 34 10v25.297c0 10-34 10-34 10s-34 0-34-10V178" fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><path d="M221 178c0 10 34 10 34 10s34 0 34-10" fill="none" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="48" x="231" y="204.995">bucket</text><path fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" d="M6 274L6 350.891 186 350.891 186 284 176 274 6 274z" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><path d="M176 274v10h10" fill="#FEFECE" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="39" x="16" y="296.995">policy</text><path d="M7 300.297L185 300.297M7 302.297L185 302.297" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="144" x="22" y="317.292">Action: s3:GetObject</text><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="148" x="22" y="333.589">Resource: &lt;bucket&gt;</text><path d="M96 91.08v75.84" fill="none" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><path fill="#A80036" d="M96 172.15L100 163.15 96 167.15 92 163.15 96 172.15z" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="13" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="30" x="97" y="134.067">uses</text><path d="M96 208.69v65.11" fill="none" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><path d="M136.12 190.5h79.63" fill="none" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><path fill="#A80036" d="M220.82 190.5L211.82 186.5 215.82 190.5 211.82 194.5 220.82 190.5z" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="13" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="48" x="154.5" y="183.567">Allowed</text><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="223" x="42" y="373.995">A natural user is tied to a person</text></svg> </p> <p>Technical users allow other services access to resources inside the account.

To give access to your account, you can use a role that can be used by identities in another account. This way you don’t need to create users and transfer secrets (passwords or access keys) to grant cross-account access. Another use-case is users logging in via SAML or Cognito. Instead of creating a user for every single person who can log in, you define a role and all users assume it. Then you can give permissions to the role and all users signed in this way will gain those permissions.</p> <p>Also, AWS services use roles to gain permissions to access your account. For example, CloudTrail can put logs into a CloudWatch Log group, but it needs permission to do so. On the Trail config, you need to specify a role:</p> <p><img src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/iam_identity_resource_policies/cloudtrail_role-72cf0208de53148da9ebb597ccf983890b3c5c8ba59222865e849f81918718c9.png" integrity="sha256-cs8CCN5TFI2p67WXzPmDiQs8XIulkiKGXoSfgZGHGMk=" crossorigin="anonymous"></p> <p>This role allows the CloudTrail service to assume it:</p> <p><img src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/iam_identity_resource_policies/cloudtrail_role_trust-88790c9eb727ab035fd2e4d564b15ca8bb07951376ea75da8e0918ce8d92983f.png" integrity="sha256-iHkMnrcnqwNf0uTVZLFcqLsHlRN26nXajgkYzo2SmD8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></p> <p>And the role has the policies to access CloudWatch Logs:</p> <p><img src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/iam_identity_resource_policies/cloudtrail_permissions-e536a8a0d9a50b84c797d688f891bdc7440c1a6c010d919b7e6bc9854dee03bd.png" integrity="sha256-5TaooNmlC4THl9aI+JG9x0QMGmwBDZGbfmvJhU3uA70=" crossorigin="anonymous"></p> <p>This way you have full control over what a given service can do. And this pattern appears in many places. A Lambda function uses a role in a similar way, the S3 bucket replication gains permissions to write a bucket using a role, and AWS Organizations creates a role in the member account so that you can initialize the resources inside it.</p> <h2 id="resource-based-policies">Resource-based policies</h2> <p>What if there is no identity to attach the policies to? This is the case for anonymous access, and also when an AWS service does not use a service role, such as an API Gateway. When there is no identity, identity-based policies can not be used.</p> <p>Many, but not all, AWS services <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html">support resource-based policies</a>.

</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>The <code>Action</code> in resource-based policies can be one that is relevant to the service. A bucket policy can allow <code>s3:GetObject</code>, a role the <code>sts:AssumeRole</code>, while a Lambda the <code>lambda:InvokeFunction</code>.</p> <p>And the <code>Resource,</code> when needed, can only start with the resource’s own ARN. This makes sense as one resource can only give access to itself or things below it but not to unrelated resources.</p> <p>How the resource defines who gets access and how specific this control is depends on the service. The <code>Principal</code> element is always present and that can define users, roles, services, other accounts, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html">a few other things</a>.</p> <p>But, especially with services, this is not granular enough. For example, when a role’s trust policy defines the Lambda service, it does not specify <em>which</em> Lambda function to trust. Similarly, the role for the CloudTrail allows the <code>cloudtrail.amazonaws.com</code> service, but there is no further restrictions on <em>which trail</em>.</p> <p>Some resource policies support conditions to allow only a given resource. For example, the policy for a Lambda function is able to selectively allow the API which can call it:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>"Condition"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
	</span><span>"ArnLike"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

	</span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>Unfortunately, there is no generic way to know which resource-based policies support further restrictions on the caller using conditions. You need to check the AWS-provided policy examples to see what conditions are possible.</p> <h2 id="using-together">Using together</h2> <p>When both types of policies are effective then you can use both to give and restrict access. When an IAM user wants to get an object from an S3 bucket then both the policy attached to the user and the one defined on the bucket are effective.</p> <h3 id="allowing-access">Allowing access</h3> <p>With most services if <em>either</em> of the policies give access to an action then it will be granted. The notable exceptions are KMS key policies and cross-account role trust policies where <em>both</em> the resource and the identity needs an explicit Allow.</p> <p>As resource-based policies can grant access to identities, the notion that a user can not do anything without attaching policies to it is not true. For example, a bucket policy can allow a user to get objects and that is effective even if the user has no permissions on its own:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>

August 27, 2020 | https://www.ccc.de/de/updates/2020/digitale-corona-listen | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ccc.de/de/updates/2020/digitale-corona-listen">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Mitglieder des Chaos Computer Clubs (CCC) haben mehrere Schwachstellen in einem weit verbreiteten Cloud-System für gastronomische Betriebe entdeckt und gemeldet. In Corona-Listen und Reservierungen waren mehrere Millionen sensible Datensätze einsehbar. Der Datenbestand reichte bis zu zehn Jahre zurück. Der Cloud-Service wurde informiert und hat die Schwachstellen nach eigenen Angaben beseitigt. Der CCC empfiehlt den Verzicht auf Cloud-Lösungen und rät dazu, Daten da zu sammeln, wo sie benötigt werden – in den Restaurants.</p><div><p>Das <a href="https://cert.ccc.de/">Chaos Emergency Response Team (CERT)</a> ist vielen bekannt als das Sanitäts- und Brandschutz-Team auf <a href="https://events.ccc.de/">Veranstaltungen des CCC</a>. Doch auch in der veranstaltungsfreien Zeit engagiert sich das CERT stets für die Sicherheit seines Umfelds.</p>
<h2>Digitale Corona-Listen</h2>
<p>Bei einem gemeinsamen Restaurantbesuch wurden Mitglieder des CERT gebeten, sich in eine <em>digitale</em> "Corona-Liste" einzutragen. Die gastgebenden Gastronominnen wollten die verpflichtende Datenerfassung offenbar modern und unkompliziert gestalten – mit Hilfe einer Cloud-Software.</p>
<p>Deren vollmundige Versprechen über die Sicherheit der erfassten Daten weckten Argwohn und Altruismus des CERT-Teams. Wie erwartet hatte das System akuten Bedarf an Sanitäts- und Brandschutzmaßnahmen durch Spezialkräfte des CCC.</p>
<h3>Über 87.000 Corona-Datensätze und 5,4 Mio. Reservierungen</h3>
<p>Verschiedene Schwachstellen ermöglichten den Zugriff auf insgesamt 87.313 Corona-Kontakterhebungen von 180 Restaurants, die das System aktiv nutzten*.</p>
<p>Im betroffenen System wurden jedoch nicht nur Corona-Listen, sondern auch Reservierungen, Bestellungen und Kassenumsätze gespeichert. <a href="https://archive.is/BS7zG">Der Cloud-Service wirbt damit</a>, monatlich über 96 Mio. Euro Umsatz von 7,7 Mio. Kundinnen sowie 600.000 Reservierungen über das System abzuwickeln*. Persönliche Daten von Besucherinnen werden vor allem bei Reservierungen und Corona-Registrierungen erfasst.</p>
<p>Insgesamt war der Zugriff auf 4,8 Mio. Personendatensätze aus über 5,4 Mio. Reservierungen möglich, wie der Cloud-Service bestätigt*.</p>
<h3>Daten reichen über ein Jahrzehnt zurück</h3>
<p>Erstaunt stellte das CERT fest, dass im System personenbezogene Daten gespeichert sind, die teilweise ein ganzes Jahrzehnt zurückreichen. Der Cloud-Service versteht sich als "<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_Service#Datenschutz_(DSGVO">Auftragsverarbeiter</a>" und verortet die Verantwortung zur Löschung bei den Gastronominnen. Die wiederum schienen sich dessen oft nicht bewusst zu sein und vertrauten verständlicherweise auf die Full-Service-Cloud.</p>
<h2>Mehrere Schwachstellen</h2>
<h3>Mangelndes Rechte-Management</h3>
<p>Durch eine fehlerhafte Prüfung der Zugriffsrechte konnte im Handumdrehen administrativer Vollzugriff auf sämtliche im System gespeicherten Daten erlangt werden. Andere Fehler in der API ermöglichten Nutzerinnen auch ohne besondere Rechte den Zugriff auf schützenswerte Daten, die nicht für Ihre Augen bestimmt waren. So konnte zum Beispiel Restaurant A auf die Corona-Daten von Restaurant B zugreifen.</p>
<h3>Unzureichend geschützte Passwörter</h3>
<p>Auch unzureichend geschützte Passwörter konnten mittels einfachem API-Request abgerufen werden. Dabei fielen dem Katastrophenschutz des CCC nicht nur Hashes, sondern auch Passwörter im Klartext auf. Für neuere Accounts wurde immerhin eine zeitgemäße Hashing-Methode verwendet.  Dennoch hätten in einer Stichprobe über 25% der Passwörter aus ihren Hashes geborgen werden können. Triviale Passwörter wie "1234" deuteten auf das Fehlen einer angemessenen Passwortrichtlinie hin.</p>
<p>Das Risiko schlecht geschützter Passwörter geht über den betroffenen Dienst hinaus, weil Nutzerinnen oft dazu neigen, das gleiche Passwort für mehrere Accounts zu verwenden.</p>
<h3>Großzügiges Bestellsystem</h3>
<p>Haben Sie in der Vergangenheit einmal vergeblich auf Ihr bestelltes Essen gewartet? Oder wurde Ihnen in einer Hamburger Eck-Kneipe mit 42 Litern Bier eine spontane Freude bereitet? Vielleicht hatte einfach nur eine brasilianische Teenagerin Spaß an der offenen API… Diese hat es ohne weitere Hindernisse ermöglicht,</p>
<ul>
<li>die Speisekarten aller Restaurants einzusehen und damit</li>
<li>für Dritte Bestellungen <em>auszulösen</em> oder zu <em>stornieren</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Selbstverständlich unter Umgehung sämtlicher gesetzter Einschränkungen. Weltweiter, grenzenloser Service!</p>
<h3>Schnelle Reaktion des Cloud-Anbieters</h3>
<p>Alle gefundenen Schwachstellen wurden durch die CERT-Mitglieder <em>Sophie, Martin, cwoomio, <br> deinkoks, Lady_Raven, Metal_Warrior, <br> Wellenformer, blubbel und cbro</em> <br> schriftlich dokumentiert und dem Betreiber gastronovi mit der Bitte um Behebung mitgeteilt.</p>
<p>In einer zügigen Reaktion bestätigte gastronovi alle gemeldeten Schwachstellen und machte sich an die umgehende Behandlung. Den lebensrettenden Sofortmaßnahmen folgt auf Rat des CCC nun auch eine ausführliche Diagnostik des Systems durch geschultes Fachpersonal.</p>
<h2>CCC rät von digitalen "Corona-Listen" ab</h2>
<p>Laut gastronovi sind die gemeldeten Schwachstellen inzwischen kuriert. Doch auch <a href="https://www.modzero.com/modlog/archives/2020/07/06/mit_webapps_gegen_covid-19/index.html">in den Systemen anderer Cloud-Services wurden bereits ähnliche Schwachstellen gefunden</a>.</p>
<p><em>"Denken first, digital second",</em> kommentiert Linus Neumann, Sprecher des Chaos Computer Clubs. <em>"Viele digitale Corona-Listen wurden mit der heißen Nadel gestrickt und machen schwer zu haltende Datenschutzversprechen. Die Sicherheit eines Papiersystems ist hingegen auch für Laien leicht zu beurteilen."</em></p>
<p>So haben etablierte Cloud-Services bestehende Systeme oft nur hastig "umfunktioniert", statt sich spezifisch mit den Sicherheits- und Datenschutzanforderungen des Contact-Tracings auseinanderzusetzen.</p>
<p><em>"Die sensiblen Daten landen dann nicht etwa beim Restaurant, sondern auf einem großen Haufen irgendwo im Internet, wo sie die nächsten Jahre auf interessierte Hackerinnen warten."</em></p>
<h3>Empfehlungen für Besucherinnen</h3>
<p>Sollte Ihr präferiertes Restaurant auf Cloud-Erfassung <em>bestehen</em>, raten wir zu neuen kulinarischen Abenteuern in anderen Etablissements.</p>
<p>Doch auch bei papierbasierter Erfassung empfiehlt der CCC das <a href="https://twitter.com/frank_rieger/status/1289113251461173248">Einrichten einer gesonderten pseudonymen E-Mail-Adresse nur für diesen Zweck</a>. Viele kostenlose Dienstanbieter ermöglichen zum Beispiel eine Weiterleitung von eingehenden Nachrichten an die eigentliche E-Mail-Adresse.</p>
<p>Fünfzehn Minuten Aufwand gewährleisten Datensparsamkeit ohne das Risiko, eine wichtige Warnung zu verpassen.</p>
<h3>Empfehlungen für die sichere Erfassung</h3>
<p>Der Chaos Computer Club rät grundsätzlich von digitalen Corona-Listen ab – erst recht, wenn diese ihre Daten in einer Cloud speichern, statt im Restaurant.</p>
<p>Auch in unseren eigenen Hackspaces verwenden wir folgendes Papier-System:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jede Besucherin oder Gruppe erhält einen <em>gesonderten Zettel</em> zur Erfassung, damit nicht die Daten anderer Gäste eingesehen werden können.</li>
<li>Der ausgefüllte Zettel wird in einen verschlossenen Briefkasten geworfen, um ihn dort <em>vor neugierigen Blicken zu schützen</em>.</li>
<li>Dieser wird am Ende des Tages in einen Umschlag geleert, welcher mit dem <em>Datum des erfassten Tages beschriftet und versiegelt</em> wird.</li>
<li>Die versiegelten Umschläge werden an einem <em>sicheren Ort</em> aufbewahrt.</li>
<li>Täglich wird ein Umschlag <em>sicher vernichtet</em>, dessen Frist abgelaufen ist – und ein neuer kommt hinzu.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Empfehlungen an den Gesetzgeber</h3>
<p>Das Ziel, Besucherinnen im Falle eines Falles schnell informieren zu können, ist legitim und wichtig. Dennoch wurden dem Unterfangen eine Reihe unnötiger Probleme in den Weg gelegt</p>
<ol>
<li>Es häufen sich die Fälle, in denen die <a href="https://www.haufe.de/compliance/recht-politik/polizeizugriff-auf-corona-gaestelisten-der-gastronomie-unzulaessig_230132_522174.html">Listen für Polizei-Ermittlungen zweckentfremdet wurden</a>. Derartige Maßnahmen motivieren Besucherinnen, falsche Daten in die Listen einzutragen.</li>
<li>Der Gesetzgeber sieht keinen Anlass, <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2020/gastro-vorratsdatenspeicherung-bundesregierung-will-corona-listen-nicht-besser-schuetzen/">diesem Datenmissbrauch ein Ende zu setzen</a>.  Damit wird das geringe verbliebene Vertrauen weiter untergraben.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/corona-und-restaurants-kundendaten-fuer-einen-schnellen-flirt-a-453e410e-50d4-4d2a-a128-fdaa2b34eee2">In vielen Einrichtungen liegen die Listen offen aus, was die Sorge vor unerwünschtem Kontakt durch andere Gäste weckt</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Leichtfertig verspieltes Vertrauen kann jetzt nur noch durch eine klare gesetzliche Regelung zurückgewonnen werden.</p>

However, if a page is considered fast by Core Web Vitals, but there isn’t enough real-world data for the page, it won’t display the label.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1234" src="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling.png" alt="Fast page label" srcset="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling.png 2048w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-300x181.png 300w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-1024x617.png 1024w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-768x463.png 768w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-1536x926.png 1536w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-1046x630.png 1046w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-150x90.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"><figcaption>Chrome 85 will have “Fast page” label when a user long-presses a link</figcaption></figure><p>The label is likely a taste of how Google will be incorporating Core Web Vitals into Google Search. It’s highly probable that Google will use a label or icon to denote fast pages, similar to what they do now for AMP pages. I also predict that sites will be told that more searchers click on results that have a fast symbol, and therefore they’ll need to score “Good” on Core Web Vitals, or they may not rank as well. I think that presupposition will age well come next year.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="750" height="778" src="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amp-icon-search-results-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amp-icon-search-results-1.png 750w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amp-icon-search-results-1-289x300.png 289w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amp-icon-search-results-1-607x630.png 607w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amp-icon-search-results-1-150x156.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></figure><p>For now, the label will be limited to Chrome users that are in <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2392284">Lite mode</a> (an Android-only feature) or have “<a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9116376">Make searches and browsing better</a>” turned on (a setting that sends URLs of pages you visit to Google).</p><h2>Never miss an important story</h2><p>Weekly news updates, no spam, and you can unsubscribe anytime.</p> <div><p><img alt="" src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/93d2d6e6492828a2f1f427dddc413f4b?s=120&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/93d2d6e6492828a2f1f427dddc413f4b?s=240&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" height="120" width="120" loading="lazy"></p><div><p><a rel="author" href="https://www.coywolf.news/jon-henshaw/">Jon Henshaw</a></p><p><small>Jon is the founder and Managing Editor of Coywolf.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><b>In this tutorial, we will see how to compile and install FFmpeg with VMAF support using libvmaf and then we shall see how to compute or calculate the VMAF score between two videos using FFmpeg with VMAF support enabled.</b></p><hr><p><strong>FFmpeg</strong> has always been at the top of everyone’s mind when it came to open source video compression software and is best described by Wikipedia as</p><blockquote><p>FFmpeg is a free and open-source project consisting of a vast software suite of libraries and programs for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams.</p></blockquote><p><strong>VMAF from Netflix</strong> stands for Video Multi-method Assessment Fusion, and it is a video quality metric that combines human vision modeling with machine learning. It’s become very popular as it succeeds (not fully) at automating subjective quality testing that usually requires humans to watch and score videos.</p><p>FFmpeg and Netflix’s VMAF are now part of every video processing and compression engineer’s toolbox. But, installing and using them appears to be difficult for a large number of users.</p><p>I see these questions often on Stackoverflow and similar websites -</p><ul><li>how to compute VMAF?</li><li>how do I compile VMAF on Ubuntu?</li><li>how do I calcuate VMAF using FFmpeg?</li><li>no such filter <code>libvmaf</code> when trying to use VMAF with FFmpeg.</li><li>VMAF example commandline</li></ul><p>and the list simply goes on. So, I decided to write down the steps of compiling and installing VMAF, FFmpeg, and computing VMAF with FFmpeg. Along the way, I’ll show you a few gotchas and common errors in the installation and usage procedure.</p><h2 id="step-0-machine-setup">Step 0: Machine Setup</h2><p>For the purpose of this document, I will set up a new $5 droplet on DigitalOcean with Ubuntu 18.04 as its operating system.</p><p>By the way, if you <a href="https://m.do.co/c/90eb9b431b9e">click here</a>, you'll receive $100 in DigitalOcean credits over 60 days! That's 60 days and $100 to experiment and play around with DigitalOcean :)</p><h2 id="step-1-install-vmaf-on-ubuntu-1804">Step 1: Install VMAF on Ubuntu 18.04</h2><p>You can use VMAF in several different ways and you can <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf">read about it here</a>. In order to use VMAF with FFmpeg, we need the help of <code>libvmaf</code> - a C library that can be used with C/C++ code. In other words, we can use it with FFmpeg.</p><p>So, here is how to install VMAF on an Ubuntu 18.04 machine -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the latest release of VMAF from <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/releases">here</a>.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">wget https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/archive/v1.5.2.tar.gz
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Untar it</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">untar -xvf https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/archive/v1.5.2.tar.gz
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Install dependencies.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-wheel ninja-build doxygen
pip3 install meson
pip3 install Cython
pip3 install numpy
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Make and Install VMAF</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>cd</span> vmaf-1.5.2/
sudo make 
sudo make install
</code></pre></div><p>Make a note of where VMAF’s <code>libvmaf</code> got installed. In my machine, it was installed to <code>/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu</code> as per the console log.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">Installing src/libvmaf.so.0.0.0 to /usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu

</code></pre></div><h2 id="step-2-install-ffmpeg-with-vmaf-support-on-ubuntu-1804">Step 2: Install FFmpeg with VMAF support on Ubuntu 18.04</h2><p>The first part is complete and you have successfully installed VMAF onto your machine. Now, let’s compile and install FFmpeg with VMAF support. These instructions are taken from <a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Ubuntu">FFmpeg’s Ubuntu Compilation Guide</a></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Install the Dependencies (including <code>nasm</code>). And, remember to create the following folders</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">mkdir -p ~/ffmpeg_sources ~/bin
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Install the Video and Audio Codecs that you are going to need. I installed <code>libx264</code>, <code>libx265-dev</code>, <code>libnuma-dev</code>, <code>libvpx-dev</code>, <code>libfdk-aac-dev</code>, <code>libmp3lame-dev</code>, and <code>libopus-dev</code>.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Make sure FFmpeg knows where to find <code>libvmaf</code></p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>export</span> <span>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span>=<span>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span>:/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/

You should now have an FFmpeg build with VMAF enabled.</p><h2 id="step-3-computing-ffmpeg-with-vmaf">Step 3: Computing FFmpeg with VMAF</h2><p>Now let’s see how we can calculate the VMAF score between two videos using FFmpeg and VMAF.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Let’s create two test videos - a 1920x1080p30 video and a 1280x720p30 video using FFmpeg’s built-in libraries that generates test data. The commandlines are shown below and as you can see, it will generate two 5-second duration clips, 30 fps, of 1920x1080p and 1280x720p resolution.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">bin/ffmpeg -f lavfi -i <span>testsrc</span>=<span>duration</span>=5:size=1920x1080:rate=<span>30</span> test_1080p30.mpg
bin/ffmpeg -f lavfi -i <span>testsrc</span>=<span>duration</span>=5:size=1280x720:rate=<span>30</span> test_720p30.mpg
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 2: Compute the VMAF score between the two videos.</strong><br>From the commandline below, you can see that we are providing the two input sequences, and then we are scaling both to 1920x1080 using a <code>bicubic</code> filter. This is important because VMAF works only on sequences having the same resolution (and the frame rate should match, else you’ll have serious problems). We are also asking FFmpeg to compute the PSNR score for these two sequences.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">bin/ffmpeg -i test_720p30.mpg -i test_1080p30.mpg -filter_complex <span>"[0:v]scale=1920x1080:flags=bicubic[main]; [1:v]scale=1920x1080:flags=bicubic,format=pix_fmts=yuv420p,fps=fps=30/1[ref]; [main][ref]libvmaf=psnr=true:log_path=vmaflog.json:log_fmt=json"</span> -f null -
</code></pre></div><p>and it should print the VMAF score as follows on the console</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">[libvmaf @ 0x55803f80c7c0] VMAF score: 86.375268
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><ol><li>The detailed per-frame details are contained in the JSON file. It contains the per-frame VMAF and PSNR scores as requested.</li><li>In FFmpeg’s filter, you can use either <code>bicubic</code> or <code>lancsoz</code> filters for the upsampling process. Netflix <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/vmaf-the-journey-continues-44b51ee9ed12">suggests</a> that <code>bicubic</code> is a better choice.</li></ol><h2 id="options-for-vmaf-using-ffmpeg">Options for VMAF using FFmpeg</h2><p>The following commandline options are available in FFmpeg for computing VMAF.</p><ul><li><code>model_path</code>
Set the model path which is to be used for SVM. Default value: <code>/usr/local/share/model/vmaf_v0.6.1.pkl</code></li><li><code>log_path</code>
Set the file path to be used to store logs.</li><li><code>log_fmt</code>
Set the format of the log file (xml or json).</li><li><code>enable_transform</code>
This option can enable/disable the score_transform applied to the final predicted VMAF score, if you have specified score_transform option in the input parameter file passed to run_vmaf_training.py Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>phone_model</code>
Invokes the phone model which will generate VMAF scores higher than in the regular model, which is more suitable for laptop, TV, etc. viewing conditions. Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>psnr</code>
Enables computing psnr along with vmaf. Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>ssim</code>
Enables computing ssim along with vmaf. Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>ms_ssim</code>
Enables computing ms_ssim along with vmaf. Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>pool</code>
Set the pool method to be used for computing vmaf. Options are <code>min</code>, <code>harmonic_mean</code> or <code>mean</code> (default).</li><li><code>n_threads</code>
Set number of threads to be used when computing vmaf. Default value: <code>0</code>, which makes use of all available logical processors.</li><li><code>n_subsample</code>
Set interval for frame subsampling used when computing vmaf. Default value: <code>1</code></li><li><code>enable_conf_interval</code>
Enables confidence interval. Default value: <code>false</code></li></ul><h2 id="common-problems-while-using-vmaf-and-ffmpeg">Common problems while using VMAF and FFmpeg.</h2><p>P1. While installing FFmpeg from the official compilation guide on Ubuntu 18.04, you will face this error <code>ERROR: gnutls not found using pkg-config</code>. To prevent this, you need to install <code>sudo apt-get install libunistring-dev</code>.</p><p>P2. Another common problem when running FFmpeg with VMAF is this <code>error libvmaf xxx not found using pkg config</code>. This means that while compiling FFmpeg, you didn’t tell it where the <code>libvmaf</code> files are. Simply run the export command and it should fix the issue.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>export</span> <span>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span>=<span>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span>:/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
</code></pre></div><h2 id="thats-it">That’s It</h2><p>I hope you were able to follow this guide and could successfully install VMAF, FFmpeg and compute the VMAF score using FFmpeg.

<p>
	(part of <a href="https://sive.rs/d1">the “do this” directives</a>)
</p>
<h3>1.
	Prioritize lifestyle design.
</h3><p>
	You’ve made it, so it’s all about you, now.  Make your dreams come true.
</p><p>
	Shape your surroundings to please your every desire.
</p><p>
	Make your <a href="https://sive.rs/book/TimeParadox">immediate gratification</a> the most important thing.
</p>

<h3>2.
	Chase that comparison moment.
</h3><p>
	You have the old thing. You want the new thing.
	Yes! Do it! Be happy for a week.
</p><p>
	Ignore the fact that the <a href="https://sive.rs/book/StumblingOnHappiness">happiness only comes from the moment of comparison between the old and new</a>.
</p><p>
	Once you’ve had your new thing for a week, and it becomes the new norm, seek happiness from another new thing.
</p>

<h3>3.
	Buy, not rent.
</h3><p>
	Why rent a house, castle, boat, or car, when you can buy?
</p><p>
	It’s not about the thing, it’s about identity.
	This shows who you are now.
</p>

<h3>4.
	Internalize your new status.
</h3><p>
	You worked hard to get here.
	Celebrate. Relax.
</p><p>
	Admit you are in a different class of people now, with different needs.
</p><p>
	Understand there is no going back.
</p>

<h3>5.
	Be a connoisseur.
</h3><p>
	Learn what others say is the finest.
</p><p>
	Insist on only the finest.
</p><p>
	You will now be <a href="https://sive.rs/book/StoicJoy">unhappy</a> with anything but the finest.
</p>

<h3>6.
	Get to know your possessions.
</h3><p>
	Now that you own the best, it’s time to focus on what you’ve got.
</p><p>
	Learn all about the features of your new possessions.
</p><p>
	Spend more time getting your surround sound and heated floor just right.
</p><p>
	Work out the solar panel charging of your Tesla car.
	This is important.
</p>

<h3>7.
	Acclimate to comfort.
</h3><p>
	Eliminate every discomfort from your life.

The idea is a simple one- many Makers asked me over the last year about printing smaller parts for the <a href="https://back7.co/home/raspberry-pi-recovery-kit">Raspberry Pi Recovery Kit</a>, and I started playing around with options.  I knew I didn’t want to just re-hash the old deck, and I knew I really wanted a better display for this year.  Let’s jump in with what’s different:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>No Pelican case required!  It’s pretty obvious from the photos that you don’t need to spend $50 or more on a case, especially if you are going to drill holes in it, or don’t actually need a waterproof case.</p></li><li><p>Smaller Bill of Materials (BOM).  The original Raspberry Pi Recovery kit was very expensive to build, primarily because I sourced the coolest looking parts I could, which can be expensive or just hard to get (like the keyboard).  This project has a much simpler BOM, so simple that here it is:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>1 kg spool of Paramount 3D’s Olive Green PETG - <a href="https://amzn.to/31lMcqy">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>(Optional) 1K spool of Carbon Fiber PETG and hardened steel nozzle - <a href="https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/carbon-fiber-pro-series-petg-filament-1.75mm/sk/MHQ646TD">Link</a> and <a href="https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/e3d-v6-extra-nozzle-hardened-steel-1.75mm-x-0.40mm/sk/MSDV7HN9">Link</a></p></li><li><p>Low profile, stainless steel M5 screws - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/92855A513/">McMaster Carr Link</a></p></li><li><p>M5 threaded rod - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/93325A413/">McMaster Carr</a> (<a href="https://amzn.to/2Evq9Vu">bolt cutters</a> are optional, but use safety gear)</p></li><li><p>Four threaded inserts - <a href="https://amzn.to/2FWzNBj">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Pimoroni HDMI Display - <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4337">Adafruit Link</a></p></li><li><p>Short HDMI Cable - <a href="https://amzn.to/31tQP21">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Four brass M2.5 standoffs - <a href="https://amzn.to/2CUUKeF">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Raspberry Pi 4 - <a href="https://amzn.to/2YwHFzF">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Core Design - <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/b4bWC7f62Ab-sizzling-fyyran/">Tinkercad Print Layout</a>, <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/eTexyDTsTKR-stunning-kieran/">Tinkercad Assembled Version</a>, <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4579460">Thingiverse</a></p></li><li><p>Thumb Screws - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/93886A240/">McMaster Carr</a></p></li><li><p>Cord Grip - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/8302K161/">McMaster Carr</a></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Something easier to modify/hack over time.  The <a href="https://back7.co/home/raspberry-pi-recovery-kit">RPRK</a> was designed to be a “finished” product and execution on an idea, and with people making their own, I thought it would be more fun this time around if people could swap out parts for their own, even ones to radically change the look of the deck.</p></li><li><p>I abandoned panel mount ports on this project.  Panel mounts are often for looks only, at least on many of my older builds, and to keep costs down I just ditched them.  Big, rounded rectangle holes work for me, and don’t cost $15 each time I want to change something.</p></li><li><p>Finally, I wanted a design I could continue to refine and modify for my own projects.  Hopefully I’ll have more of those to share soon!</p></li></ul><p>With that out of the way, let’s go over the basic design.  This can be used as assembly instructions in a pinch too.  Here’s the front frame, which the Pimoroni display will connect to.  That’s really done last, so we won’t see this part again for a while.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597467959462_38425"><p>With that out of the way let’s focus on the main frame, which helps hold it all together.  Here are some of the parts.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_18333"><div><p>The design is simple for the front- there are four threaded inserts for holding the display on the front.  Make sure they go on the front of the front frame.  There are two halves of the front frame, which is held together by the “joiner” part, which has spare M5 holes in case you want to mount something here.  I was still on a carbon fiber kick (read: I still had the hardened steel nozzle installed) so that part was printed with that stuff.  It’s great, but not required if you don’t want to deal with a second and somewhat picky filament.</p><p>Next it’s all about printing all of the rear parts, including what I call the ends and the top/bottom.  </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_22206"><p>The top and bottom parts are not interchangeable between top and bottom, they go on one orientation only.  This will likely take a while to print!</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_26233"><div><p><strong>CAUTION:</strong></p><p>As you start to assemble be careful of the resistance of some of the deeper holes that screws and threaded rods are going into.  If you feel too much resistance you may need to drill or tap some of the holes- this depends a ton on your printer.  This is especially true of the M5 threaded rod in the next section, which can get bound in the many parts and get very difficult to move.  If you think that’s happening, back out the M5 rod and use a power drill to drill the part holes.  You really only need threading on the parts on each end of the enclosure, and even if you drill it all out, end caps/nuts will do fine to hold the whole thing together.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_27776"><div>

Not all the uppers and lowers will need to be bolted in, but each of the uppers and lowers has the screw hole just in case.  This just makes it easier to keep parts organized.  With all of them bolted it should look like this:</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_33687"><div>

This design took about 7 months to design, including a 3 month break due to life and COVID impacts.  I am lucky so far to be able to continue to work on these projects, and it’s been a great relief to “finish” it.  Like all of my previous projects here, all of the design files and parts lists are in this article so people can make/modify as they see fit.  I would remind fellow makers that it’s licensed under a non-commercial license, so while you can print/modify, doing so commercially is not supported under this project.  Want to do that?  Just reach out to me and we can figure something out.</p><p>Going forward though, many of my originals like this one will be for sale in my shop.  They will be more expensive than making it yourself, so if you’re willing to try- make one!  Commissions are limited and not guaranteed, so the items from my project builds may not last.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-3389">

<div>
<p>Those that know me, know that I am both bold and resolute. I stand by my thoughts / comments, yet I attempt to keep an open mind, analyze a situation, self-reflect on any biases, and integrate feedback. I even go so far as to analyze my confidence level, see <a href="https://predictionbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predictionbook.com</a>.</p>
<p>With that in mind. I want to share how utterly angry and helpless I feel —</p>
<p>I can’t share my true thoughts, hell my analysis, of the current political situation in the U.S. Although I have written on it countless times, I end up deleting the posts.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It’s not safe to share thoughts.</p>
<h2>State of Affairs</h2>
<p>Today, sharing one’s opinion can cost you your livelihood, your ability to communicate, and more.</p>
<p>Historically, that was always true, perhaps more-so. We’re now returning to the status quo — repression.</p>
<p>Today’s flavor of repression is one where offending someone randomly across the globe, can cost you your job. That person may not have a standing in your community and may not have a relationship with your employer. However, they can amplify their voice, tweet your employer, and your employer (scared out of its mind by the current situation) will terminate you. That is the state of affairs today. It doesn’t matter if you’re correct or innocent. It doesn’t even matter if 99.9% of people aren’t offended by what you said — we are now in a world of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shaming#Cancellation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancel culture</a>“.</p>
<h2>Finding Middle Ground</h2>
<p>In the United States in 2020, we have two paths. One path leads to an ever more left-leaning populous “uprising”; the other path leads to an ever more right-leaning populous “uprising”. I don’t see an alternative, outside of some quite-frankly comical alternatives (e.g. President Mitt Romney, with VP Bernie Sanders).</p>
<p>One way or another, I lose. No one is speaking up for my beliefs or representing me.</p>
<p>I sense I’m not alone. Everyone I speak to left or right, hates the current state of affairs. Most of us even agree on <em>why</em> we distrust the system. Unfortunately, we can’t elect someone to fix the system. Neither Trump, nor Biden, nor Bernie, nor anyone on the ballot accurately represents or even inspires us.</p>
<p>By and large, I believe this is due to the “absolute” nature of our current social strife. Take the question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why can’t I be anti-vaccine and pro-choice?</p></blockquote>
<p>You would suspect everyone would agree that we “own” our bodies. If that were true, then you would effectively have to be pro-choice AND support people’s right to choose what to put in their bodies; body ownership is the middle ground. I wish we could coalesce around the middle ground, then compromise on edge cases, enabling progress.</p>
<p>Take another example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why don’t we do firearms training in schools?</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s an honest question — we’ve had the 2nd amendment for hundreds of years. Similar to driving a car, we should train our youth to handle firearms. I suspect we all know the reason this is not occurring — because a significant portion of the United States is fearful of firearms.</p>
<p>From the evidence, the fear is unjustified. We have evidence that with a good training program and robust mental evaluation process, firearms by-and-large are safe for society. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_regulation_in_Switzerland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Switzerland</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Swiss males grow up expecting to undergo basic military training, usually at age 20 in the recruit school..</p>
<p>…Prior to 2007, members of the Swiss Militia were supplied with 50 rounds of ammunition for their military weapon in a sealed ammo box that was regularly audited by the government…</p>
<p>…Every person with a Swiss citizenship, aged 10 years or older, can take part at any federal ranges and will be able to shoot for free with the ordinance rifle…</p>
<p>…In 2016, there were 187 attempted and 45 completed homicides, for a homicide rate of 0.50 per 100,000 population, giving Switzerland one of the lowest homicide rates in the world…</p></blockquote>
<p>Further, firearms are already widely available (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_civilian_guns_per_capita_by_country" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">300+ million guns in the U.S.</a>) &amp; availability enshrined in law.</p>
<p>Sorrowfully, evidence doesn’t matter here; fear guides many. Yoda has some insights here:</p>
<blockquote><p><span data-parade-type="promoarea" data-parade-location-types="promoarea" data-parade-location-ids="article" data-parade-views="false" data-parade-touches="false" data-parade-clicks="false" data-parade-mouseovers="false">Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.</span></p>
<p>— George Lucas (Yoda)</p></blockquote>
<h2>The False Dichotomy</h2>
<p>I don’t agree with the left or the right on many things in United States politics. In fact, I find most of the arguments a false dichotomy, designed to garner votes. To share one’s full thoughts would cause either or both sides to lash out, even though evidence may support the claims / musings.</p>
<p>Regretfully, this leaves me and many others out of the public discourse. While most of us have heard,</p>
<blockquote><p>The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.</p>
<p>— Edmund Burke (attributed)</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s not quite that simple and I prefer another sentiment:</p>
<blockquote><p>A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true.</p>
<p>— Martin Luther King Jr.</p></blockquote>

<iframe data-lazy-type="iframe" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0On19DRA2fU?start=88" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="lazy lazy-hidden mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></center><p>Truthfully, we’re all being held hostage. I am very confident few people fully agree with either side in this political theater. We have extremists on either side shouting and being amplified by social media. In truth, the vast majority of us don’t agree [fully] with either extreme. Most of us, want to “live and let live” — that’s the American way. We’re a country founded on our hatred for taxes and the desire to live free from persecution. Please, please.. Don’t let that change.</p>
<p>It’s easy to decide “what’s right” when you look at it through that lens — am I persecuting others or increasing taxes (arguably a form of persecution)? If either are true, likely we should reconsider our stance.</p>
<h2>The Chaos</h2>
<p>Today, we are edging towards chaos. We all feel it. Riots, job loss, deadly diseases, [trade] wars, homelessness… We need leadership that can unite us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of our would-be leaders have opted out or have been pushed out of this system. They’ve become engineers, scientists, bloggers — too scared to share their opinions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_Star_Codex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even shutting down</a>). To hold a nuanced opinion different from the “socially accepted” by one group or another will get you “canceled”. In this case, “canceled” can mean anything from losing your job, to losing financial platforms/instruments (i.e. PayPal, VISA, YouTube revenue, etc.), to receiving threats on your life.</p>
<p>We have an ongoing pandemic, with millions in the United States likely about to perish, the economy collapsing, and we still cannot escape the politics.</p>
<p>I’m not hopeful.</p>
<p>I have so many musings, stories, and analyses I’d like to share, but neither facts nor my opinions matter.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest —</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m a white, cisgender, straight, male</li>
<li>I work as a technical manager in a research group, at a bank</li>
<li>I’m socially liberal in many ways and conservative in others</li>
<li>I grew up lower-middle class; now, I’m upper-middle class</li>
<li>I don’t attribute myself to any political party</li>
</ul>
<p>A large number of people dismiss or overlook me because of my background. Those who don’t outright dismiss me are also not likely to support my interest(s).</p>
<h2>Meritocracy or Bust</h2>
<p>What scares me is that I am a father and I am fearful for my children’s future. I was raised with the understanding that America is a meritocracy. Regardless of your race, gender, or creed, you should have the ability to make a life in the United States,<strong><em> to build a future for your children</em></strong>. Sadly, I don’t see the same core mission today. None of the political parties or the government at large appears forward-looking, for the children. Perhaps, that’s because of a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/births.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declining birthrate</a>, I’m not sure.</p>
<p>As someone with children, I’m pleading for a group to come together to challenge the current status quo and equitably look to improve our society. We do have systemic problems that need to be fixed. Compromises will need to be made, but I don’t believe we need sacrifices from anyone.</p>
<p>The racism and sexism needs to stop. I suspect, most of us (though, not all) want a meritocracy, a hierarchy based on merit. Unfortunately, what’s being propagated is a hierarchy based on race, sex and orientation — the under-privileged. It’s clear from the countless stories we see in the news. I am sure you are tired of the racism, as am I. That’s probably true regardless of which side of the political spectrum you fall.</p>
<p><em>No one’s</em> value to society should be assessed by their race, gender or creed. A person’s value should be based off what they have to offer to a given group, organization, or society. We can rally around that idea (that we’re all equal, differentiated on merit) and work to improve. It’s a middle ground we can [mostly] agree on. From there, we can fix the injustices.</p>
<p>What horrifies me, is that even to express that <em>“we’re all equal” </em>is a challenge to this new socio-economic hierarchy. <em>No one</em> is representing me or has my family’s best interests in mind. Realistically, I don’t expect anyone to have <em>my family’s interests</em> in mind, but I don’t want my potential / rights eroded.</p>
<p>Due to this political tug of war, both sides of the political spectrum want to diminish our rights; they’re only bickering over which rights to diminish. Let’s stop this tug of war and come together.</p>
<p>If we don’t come together, soon enough we won’t have a democracy, or frankly, a future to build for.</p>
<h2>In the Words of John Adams…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide. It is in vain to say that democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less ambitious, or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy. It is not true, in fact, and nowhere appears in history. Those passions are the same in all men, under all forms of simple government, and when unchecked, produce the same effects of fraud, violence, and cruelty. When clear prospects are opened before vanity, pride, avarice, or ambition, for their easy gratification, it is hard for the most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious moralists to resist the temptation. Individuals have conquered themselves. Nations and large bodies of men, never.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p><em>Edit from 2015/12/17: Memory model described in this article is deprecated starting Apache Spark 1.6+, the new memory model is based on UnifiedMemoryManager&nbsp;and described in <a href="https://0x0fff.com/spark-memory-management/" target="_blank">this article</a></em></p>
<p>Over the recent time I’ve answered a series of questions related to ApacheSpark architecture on StackOverflow. All of them seem to be caused by the absence of a good general description of the Spark architecture in the internet. Even official guide does not have that many details and of cause it lacks good diagrams. Same for the “Learning Spark” book and the materials of official workshops.</p>
<p>In this article I would try to fix this and provide a single-stop shop guide for Spark architecture in general and some most popular questions on its concepts. This article is not for complete beginners – it will not provide you an insight on the Spark main programming abstractions (RDD and DAG), but requires their knowledge as a prerequisite.</p>
<p>This is the first&nbsp;article in a series. The second one regarding shuffle <a href="https://0x0fff.com/spark-architecture-shuffle/" target="_blank">is available here</a>. The third one about new memory management model <a href="https://0x0fff.com/spark-memory-management/" target="_blank">is available here</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the official picture available on the <a href="http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.3.0/cluster-overview.html">http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.3.0/cluster-overview.html</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-Official.png"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-Official-300x140.png?resize=300%2C140" alt="Spark Architecture Official" width="300" height="140" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-Official.png?resize=300%2C140&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-Official.png?w=607&amp;ssl=1 607w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>As you might see, it has many terms introduced at the same time – “executor”, “task”, “cache”, “Worker Node” and so on. When I started to learn the Spark concepts some time ago, it was almost the only picture about Spark architecture available over the internet and now the things didn’t change much. I personally don’t really like this because it does not show some important concepts or shows them not in the best way.</p>
<p>Let’s start from the beginning. Any, any Spark process that would ever work on your cluster or local machine is a JVM process. As for any JVM process, you can configure its heap size with <em>-Xmx</em> and <em>-Xms</em> flags of the JVM. How does this process use its heap memory and why does it need it at all? Here’s the diagram of Spark memory allocation inside of the JVM heap:</p>

<p>By default, Spark starts with 512MB JVM heap. To be on a safe side and avoid OOM error Spark allows to utilize only 90% of the heap, which is controlled by the <em>spark.storage.safetyFraction</em> parameter of Spark. Ok, as you might have heard of Spark as an in-memory tool, Spark allows you to store some data in memory. If you have read my article here <a href="https://0x0fff.com/spark-misconceptions/">https://0x0fff.com/spark-misconceptions/</a>, you should understand that Spark is not really in-memory tool, it just utilizes the memory for its LRU cache (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms</a>). So some amount of memory is reserved for the caching of the data you are processing, and this part is usually 60% of the safe heap, which is controlled by the <em>spark.storage.memoryFraction</em> parameter. So if you want to know how much data you can cache in Spark, you should take the sum of all the heap sizes for all the executors, multiply it by <em>safetyFraction</em> and by <em>storage.memoryFraction</em>, and by default it is 0.9 * 0.6 = 0.54 or 54% of the total heap size you allow Spark to use.</p>
<p>Now a bit more about the shuffle memory. It is calculated as “Heap Size” * <em>spark.shuffle.safetyFraction</em> * <em>spark.shuffle.memoryFraction</em>. Default value for <em>spark.shuffle.safetyFraction</em> is 0.8 or 80%, default value for <em>spark.shuffle.memoryFraction</em> is 0.2 or 20%. So finally you can use up to 0.8*0.2 = 0.16 or 16% of the JVM heap for the shuffle. But how does Spark uses this memory? You can get more details on this here (<a href="https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-1.3/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/shuffle/ShuffleMemoryManager.scala">https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-1.3/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/shuffle/ShuffleMemoryManager.scala</a>), but in general Spark uses this memory for the exact task it is called after – for Shuffle. When the shuffle is performed, sometimes you as well need to sort the data. When you sort the data, you usually need a buffer to store the sorted data (remember, you cannot modify the data in the LRU cache in place as it is there to be reused later). So it needs some amount of RAM to store the sorted chunks of data. What happens if you don’t have enough memory to sort the data? There is a wide range of algorithms usually referenced as “external sorting” (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_sorting">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_sorting</a>) that allows you to sort the data chunk-by-chunk and then merge the final result together.</p>
<p>The last part of RAM I haven’t yet cover is “unroll” memory. The amount of RAM that is allowed to be utilized by unroll process is <em>spark.storage.unrollFraction</em> * <em>spark.storage.memoryFraction</em> * <em>spark.storage.safetyFraction</em>, which with the default values equal to 0.2 * 0.6 * 0.9 = 0.108 or 10.8% of the heap. This is the memory that can be used when you are unrolling the block of data into the memory. Why do you need to unroll it after all? Spark allows you to store the data both in serialized and deserialized form. The data in serialized form cannot be used directly, so you have to unroll it before using, so this is the RAM that is used for unrolling. It is shared with the storage RAM, which means that if you need some memory to unroll the data, this might cause dropping some of the partitions stored in the Spark LRU cache.</p>
<p>This is great, because at the moment you know what exactly Spark process is and how it utilizes the memory of its JVM processes. Now let’s switch to the cluster mode – when you start a Spark cluster, how does it really look like? I like YARN so I would cover how it works in YARN, but in general it is the same for any cluster manager you use:</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN-1024x826.png?resize=625%2C504" alt="Spark Architecture On YARN" width="625" height="504" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png?resize=1024%2C826&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png?resize=300%2C242&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png?resize=624%2C503&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png?w=1816&amp;ssl=1 1816w, https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png?w=1250&amp;ssl=1 1250w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>When you have a YARN cluster, it has a YARN Resource Manager daemon that controls the cluster resources (practically memory) and a series of YARN Node Managers running on the cluster nodes and controlling node resource utilization. From the YARN standpoint, each node represents a pool of RAM that you have a control over. When you request some resources from YARN Resource Manager, it gives you information of which Node Managers you can contact to bring up the execution containers for you. Each execution container is a JVM with requested heap size. JVM locations are chosen by the YARN Resource Manager and you have no control over it – if the node has 64GB of RAM controlled by YARN (<em>yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb</em> setting in yarn-site.xml) and you request 10 executors with 4GB each, all of them can be easily started on a single YARN node even if you have a big cluster.</p>
<p>When you start Spark cluster on top of YARN, you specify the amount of executors you need (<em>–num-executors</em> flag or <em>spark.executor.instances</em> parameter), amount of memory to be used for each of the executors (<em>–executor-memory</em> flag or <em>spark.executor.memory </em>&nbsp;parameter), amount of cores allowed to use for each executors (<em>–executor-cores</em> flag of <em>spark.executor.cores</em> parameter), and amount of cores dedicated for each task’s execution (<em>spark.task.cpus</em> parameter). Also you specify the amount of memory to be used by the driver application (<em>–driver-memory</em> flag or <em>spark.driver.memory</em> parameter).</p>
<p>When you execute something on a cluster, the processing of your job is split up into stages, and each stage is split into tasks. Each task is scheduled separately. You can consider each of the JVMs working as executors as a pool of task execution slots, each executor would give you <em>spark.executor.cores</em> / <em>spark.task.cpus</em> execution slots for your tasks, with a total of <em>spark.executor.instances</em> executors. Here’s&nbsp;an example. The cluster with 12 nodes running YARN Node Managers, 64GB of RAM each and 32 CPU cores each (16 physical cores with hyper threading). This way on each node you can start 2 executors with 26GB of RAM each (leave some RAM for system processes, YARN NM and DataNode), each executor with 12 cores to be utilized for tasks (leave some cores for system processes, YARN NM and DataNode). So In total your cluster would handle 12 machines * 2 executors per machine * 12 cores per executor / 1 core for each task = 288 task slots. This means that your Spark cluster would be able to run up to 288 tasks in parallel thus utilizing almost all the resources you have on this cluster. The amount of RAM you can use for caching your data on this cluster is 0.9 <em>spark.storage.safetyFraction&nbsp;</em>* 0.6 <em>spark.storage.memoryFraction&nbsp;</em>* 12 machines * 2 executors per machine * 26 GB per executor = 336.96 GB. Not that much, but in most cases it is enough.</p>
<p>So far so good, now you know how the Spark uses its JVM’s memory and what are the execution slots you have on your cluster. As you might already noticed, I didn’t stop in details on what the “task” really is. This would be a subject of the next article, but basically it is a single unit of work performed by Spark, and is executed as a <strong><em>thread</em></strong> in the executor JVM. This is the secret under the Spark low job startup time – forking additional thread inside of the JVM is much faster that bringing up the whole JVM, which is performed when you start a MapReduce job in Hadoop.</p>
<p>Now let’s focus on another Spark abstraction called “<em><strong>partition</strong></em>”. All the data you work with in Spark is split into partitions. What a single partition is and how is it determined? Partition size completely depends on the data source you use. For most of the methods to read the data in Spark you can specify the amount of partitions you want to have in your RDD. When you read a file from HDFS, you use Hadoop’s InputFormat to make it. By default each input split returned by InputFormat is mapped to a single partition in RDD. For most of the files on HDFS single input split is generated for a single block of data stored on HDFS, which equals to approximately 64MB of 128MB of data. Approximately, because the data in HDFS is split on exact block boundaries in bytes, but when it is processed it is split on the record splits. For text file the splitting character is the newline char, for sequence file it is the block end and so on. The only exception of this rule is compressed files – if you have the whole text file compressed, then it cannot be split into records and the whole file would become a single input split and thus a single partition in …</p></div></div>

<p>The amount of folks who are up in arms about <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/25/linux_kernel_email/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sarah Novotny's views on email based workflows in Linux</a> put a smirk on my face today, but I figured I would post my own opinions, having both spent way too many hours with mutt, offlineimap, postfix, and so on. I even wrote an entire article series on this for Ars Technica that is so old I can't even find it on the web any more. And Lee Hutchinson's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/02/how-to-run-your-own-e-mail-server-with-your-own-domain-part-1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">version is from 2014</a>! </p>

<p>How can someone who is wanting to contribute to the kernel possibly not know how to send a plain text email? If you can't do that then you have no business in the kernel right?</p>

<p>It's not a matter of can't, it's a matter of won't. There's a reason no one writes their resumes in LaTeX either.  Sure, I can do it. I figured it out, achievement unlocked. </p>

<p>You would be shocked at the amount of <em>core contributors to Kubernetes</em> that we routinely find aren't subscribed to the main mailing list. Sending git formatted patches over email, are you kidding? Most of my open source collaborators aren't even  <em>reading</em> their emails lol. </p>

<p>You don't send a mail to the list to propose something, you <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps" rel="noopener" target="_blank">write an enhancement proposal</a> and if you're nice, you might mention it on a list, but all that activity happens in GitHub. And if you want a meaty discussion you hop onto Zoom and discuss it high bandwidth style with your SIG before moving on. You're not going to find lengthy discussions about technical features on many of our mailing lists, you'll find them in the GitHub issues, PR comments, and meeting transcripts. </p>

<ul>
<li>VMware (my employer) has incredible Kubernetes and cloud native content: <a href="https://tgik.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TGIK</a>  is all on YouTube. </li>
<li>It's not a coincidence that <a href="https://www.openshift.com/streaming" rel="noopener" target="_blank">OpenShift streams on twitch</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>No fair you say! There's a difference between using/consuming technical content and coordinating/running an entire project. That's the point, not any more! </p>

<p>Watch how Martin Wimpress <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ICRjjjMbEE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">does a live package update in Ubuntu MATE</a>. That level of interaction with the audience isn't just the future of OSS development, it's the present. Our next kernel people, Debian maintainers, library maintainers, and everything inbetween are sitting in places like this and this is how they interact with themselves and their communities. There's just too much awesome shit in the world for people to slow down to figure out emails and mailman. And if you think this is just about email, wait until you see how much coordination and awesome stuff is happening in Discord. Yep, this is about IRC too, all of it. </p>

<p>I hear ya, I wish plaintext wasn't on the way out as a workflow, but at the end of the day, most projects aren't Linux. You can't afford an email mailing list workflow, you need to be where the developers are. New developers coming into the field are as likely to be on AOL than setting up mutt, that's just how it ended up. The distribution developers know how to do this, it's part of their job, but let's not kid ourselves,  the eyeballs are not on mailing lists.</p>

<p>Linux is missing an entire generation of new talent due to this. I don't sweat it, Linux is fundamental technology, it'll survive just fine, but it'll continue to be a workflow that won't jive with a number of people coming into the field. </p>

<p>Also it's pretty evident from most Microsoft conspiracy comments that no one bothered to look up Sarah's OSS credentials, but of course, that didn't surprise you either. Her points still stand if you replace GitHub with GitLab, or whatever tool you prefer. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>We accidentally a whole hash function… but we had a good reason!
Our
<a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/umash">MIT-licensed UMASH hash function</a>
is a decently fast non-cryptographic hash function that guarantees
a worst-case bound on the probability of collision
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_hashing#Mathematical_guarantees">between any two inputs generated independently of the UMASH parameters</a>.</p><p>On the
<a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/xeon_platinum/8175m">2.5 GHz Intel 8175M</a>
servers that power <a href="https://backtrace.io/">Backtrace</a>’s hosted
offering, UMASH computes a 64-bit hash for short cached inputs of up
to 64 bytes in 9-22 ns, and for longer ones at up to 22 GB/s, while
guaranteeing that two distinct inputs of at most \(s\) bytes collide
with probability less than \(\lceil s / 2048 \rceil \cdot 2^{-56}\).
If that’s not good enough, we can also reuse most of the parameters to
compute two independent UMASH values. The resulting 128-bit
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_(computing)">fingerprint function</a>
offers a short-input latency of 9-26 ns, a peak throughput of 11.2
GB/s, and a collision probability of \(\lceil s / 2048 \rceil^2 \cdot
2^{-112}\) (better than \(2^{-70}\) for input size up to 7.5 GB).
These collision bounds hold for all inputs constructed without any
feedback about the randomly chosen UMASH parameters.</p><p>The latency on short cached inputs (9-22 ns for 64 bits, 9-26 ns for
128) is somewhat worse than the state of the art for non-cryptographic
hashes—
<a href="https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/wyhash">wyhash</a> achieves
8-15 ns and <a href="http://fastcompression.blogspot.com/2019/03/presenting-xxh3.html">xxh3</a>
8-12 ns—but still in the same ballpark. It also
compares well with latency-optimised hash functions like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function#FNV-1a_hash">FNV-1a</a>
(5-86 ns) and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash#MurmurHash2">MurmurHash64A</a>
(7-23 ns).</p><p>Similarly, UMASH’s peak throughput (22 GB/s) does not match
the current best hash throughput (37 GB/s with
<a href="https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash">xxh3</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/gamozolabs/falkhash">falkhash</a>, apparently
10% higher with <a href="https://github.com/cmuratori/meow_hash">Meow hash</a>),
but does comes within a factor of two; it’s actually higher than that of
some performance-optimised hashes, like
<a href="https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/wyhash">wyhash</a> (16 GB/s) and
<a href="https://github.com/google/farmhash">farmhash32</a>
(19 GB/s). In fact, even the 128-bit fingerprint (11.2 GB/s) is
comparable to respectable options like
<a href="https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/blob/master/src/MurmurHash2.cpp#L89">MurmurHash64A</a>
(5.8 GB/s) and
<a href="https://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/spooky.html">SpookyHash</a> (11.6 GB/s).</p><p>What sets UMASH apart from these other non-cryptographic hash
functions is its proof of a collision probability bound. In the
absence of an adversary that adaptively constructs pathological inputs
as it infers more information about the randomly chosen parameters, we
know that two distinct inputs of \(s\) or fewer bytes will have the
same 64-bit hash with probability at most \(\lceil s / 2048 \rceil
\cdot 2^{-56},\) where the expectation is taken over the random
“key” parameters.</p><p>Only one non-cryptographic hash function in
<a href="https://github.com/rurban/smhasher">Reini Urban’s fork of SMHasher</a>
provides this sort of bound: <a href="https://github.com/lemire/clhash">CLHash</a>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03465">guarantees a collision probability \(\approx 2^{-63}\)</a>
in the same
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_hashing#Mathematical_guarantees">universal hashing</a>
model as UMASH. While CLHash’s peak throughput (22 GB/s) is
equal to UMASH’s, its latency on short inputs is worse (23-25 ns
instead of 9-22ns). We will also see that its stronger collision
bound remains too weak for many practical applications. In order to
compute a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_(computing)">fingerprint</a>
with CLHash, one would have to combine multiple hashes, exactly like
we did for the 128-bit UMASH fingerprint.</p><p>Actual cryptographic hash functions provide stronger bounds in a much
more pessimistic model; however they’re also markedly slower than
non-cryptographic hashes. <a href="https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3">BLAKE3</a>
needs at least 66 ns to hash short inputs, and achieves a peak throughput
of 5.5 GB/s. Even the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29754">reduced-round SipHash-1-3</a>
hashes short inputs in 18-40 ns and longer ones at a peak throughput
of 2.8 GB/s. That’s the price of their pessimistically adversarial
security model. Depending on the application, it can make sense to
consider a more restricted adversary that must prepare its dirty deed
before the hash function’s parameters are generated at random, and
still ask for provable bounds on the probability of collisions.
That’s the niche we’re targeting with UMASH.</p><p>Clearly, the industry is comfortable with no bound at all.
However, even in the absence of
<a href="https://www.131002.net/siphash/#at">seed-independent collisions</a>,
timing side-channels in a data structure implementation could
theoretically leak information about colliding inputs, and iterating
over a hash table’s entries to print its contents can divulge even more
bits. A sufficiently motivated adversary could use something like
that to learn more about the key and deploy an algorithmic denial of
service attack. For example, the linear structure of UMASH (and of
other polynomial hashes like CLHash) makes it easy to combine known
collisions to create exponentially more colliding inputs. There is no
universal answer; UMASH is simply another point in the solution space.</p><p>If reasonable performance coupled with an actual bound on collision
probability <em>for data that does not adaptively break the hash</em> sounds
useful to you,
<a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/umash">take a look at UMASH on GitHub</a>!</p><p>The <a href="#but-why">next section</a> will explain why we found it useful to
design another hash function. The rest of the post

GHz during our run.</small></p><h2 id="a-idbut-whyahow-did-we-even-get-here"><a id="but-why"></a>How did we even get here?</h2><p>Engineering is the discipline of satisficisation: crisply defined
problems with perfect solutions rarely exist in reality, so we must
resign ourselves to satisfying approximate constraint sets “well
enough.” However, there are times when all options are not only
imperfect, but downright sucky. That’s when one has to put on a
different hat, and question the problem itself: are our constraints
irremediably at odds, or are we looking at an under-explored
solution space?</p><p>In the former case, we simply have to want something else. In the
latter, it might make sense to spend time to really understand the
current set of options and hand-roll a specialised approach.</p><p>That’s the choice we faced when we started caching intermediate
results in
<a href="https://help.backtrace.io/en/articles/2428859-web-console-overview">Backtrace’s database</a>
and found a dearth of acceptable hash functions. Our in-memory
columnar database is a core component of the backend, and, like most
analytics databases, it tends to process streams of similar queries.
However, a naïve query cache would be ineffective: our more heavily
loaded servers handle a constant write load of more than 100 events
per second with dozens of indexed attributes (populated column values)
each. Moreover, queries invariably select a large number of data
points with a time windowing predicate that excludes old data… and
the endpoints of these time windows advance with each wall-clock
second. The queries evolve over time, and must usually consider newly
ingested data points.</p><p><a href="https://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/~rodrigo/slider_middleware14.pdf">Bhatotia et al’s Slider</a>
show how we can specialise the idea of
<a href="http://adapton.org/">self-adjusting or incremental computation</a>
for repeated MapReduce-style queries over a sliding window.
The key idea is to split the data set at stable boundaries (e.g., on
date change boundaries rather than 24 hours from the beginning of the
current time window) in order to expose memoisation opportunities, and
to do so recursively to repair around point mutations to older data.</p><p>Caching fully aggregated partial results works well for static
queries, like scheduled reports… but the first step towards creating
a great report is interactive data exploration, and that’s an activity
we strive to support well, even when drilling down tens of millions of
rich data points. That’s why we want to also cache intermediate
results, in order to improve response times when tweaking a saved
report, or when crafting ad hoc queries to better understand how and
when an application fails.</p><p>We must go back to a
<a href="http://www.umut-acar.org/self-adjusting-computation">more general incremental computation strategy</a>:
rather than only splitting up inputs, we want to stably partition the
data dependency graph of each query, in order to identify shared
subcomponents whose results can be reused. This finer grained
strategy surfaces opportunities to “resynchronise” computations, to
recognize when different expressions end up generating a subset of
identical results, enabling reuse in later steps. For example, when
someone updates a query by adding a selection predicate that only
rejects a small fraction of the data, we can expect to reuse some of
the post-selection work executed for earlier incarnations of the
query, if we remember to key on the selected data points rather than
the predicates.</p><p>The complication here is that these intermediate results tend to be
large. Useful analytical queries start small (a reasonable query
coupled with cache/transaction invalidation metadata to stand in for
the full data set), grow larger as we select data points, arrange them
in groups, and materialise their attributes, and shrink again at the
end, as we summarise data and throw out less interesting groups.</p><p>When caching the latter shrinking steps, where resynchronised reuse
opportunities abound and can save a lot of CPU time, we often
find that storing a fully materialised representation of the cache key
would take up more space than the cached result.</p><p>A classic approach in this situation is to fingerprint cache keys with
a cryptographic hash function like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAKE_(hash_function)">BLAKE</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3">SHA-3</a>, and store a
compact (128 or 256 bits) fingerprint instead of the cache key: the
probability of a collision is then so low that we might as well assume
any false positive will have been caused by a bug in the code or a
hardware failure. For example,
<a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~omutlu/pub/memory-errors-at-facebook_dsn15.pdf#page=3">a study of memory errors at Facebook</a>
found that uncorrectable memory errors affect 0.03% of servers each
month. Assuming a generous clock rate of 5 GHz, this means each
clock cycle may be afflicted by such a memory error with probability
\(\approx 2.2\cdot 10^{-20} &gt; 2^{-66}.\) If we can guarantee that
distinct inputs collide with probability significantly less than
\(2^{-66}\), e.g., \(&lt; 2^{-70},\) any collision is far
more likely to have been caused by a bug in our code or by
hardware failure than by the fingerprinting algorithm itself.</p><p>Using cryptographic hashes is certainly safe enough, but requires a lot of
CPU time, and, more importantly, worsens latency on smaller keys (for
which caching may not be that …</p></div></article></div></div>

                <p>Personal CRM — relationship management software for consumers — is not a new category. &nbsp;Early versions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardfile">Microsoft’s Cardfile</a> date back to 1985. Broadly defined, ‘personal CRM’ helps <em>individuals</em> build out their professional and personal networks. We attribute the term to individuals repurposing sales customer-relationship management (CRM) software such as Hubspot to manage their personal networks; creating “Personal CRM.” Phrases like “Social CRM” have been used to describe relationship management software for individuals <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2011/10/05/linkedin-acquires-social-crm-company-connected/#63ef5e0c6c3d">since 2011</a>.</p><p>This article details the current landscape of personal relationship management software.</p><h2 id="overview">Overview</h2><p>Personal CRM solutions in 2020 have a variety of target audience and key feature differentiators.

                <div>
                    <p>It's amazing how many companies have gone remote this year. From Google to Facebook. From Infosys to Atlassian. No one has been spared. Suddenly, the learnings of players like <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a> and others are like the golden rules that companies want to copy to get this bit right. </p><p>However, it's still early days. Here's what the reality looks like.</p><figure></figure><p>You spend 20-30% of your time on calls. You spend a significant chunk of the time left on emails. And replying to Slack. Everything is scheduled around these activities.</p><p>How do you get deep work done? How do you collaborate without constantly distracting people away? Or being ignored like people ignore push notifications.</p><p>The common theme from top remote companies is to get the asynchronous communication right. But companies have tackled it by having as many meetings as possible. Like they would in real life. </p><p>Just that it's way worse. </p><p>All the water-cooler conversations, side-chats over coffee, smoke breaks, hanging-out-casually-at-someones-desk or lunch have been replaced by annoying notifications on Slack. Unnecessary emails. And endless zoom calls on the calendar.</p><p>The weird things about Zoom is how easy it is to show you could care less. Have more than one person in a meeting? Mute yourself and wander off in your own cocoon on the internet. Skip showing your face. </p><p>You choose to be <em>less </em>connected with someone. Your choices act as micro-passive-aggressive-indicators of how much you're interested in something or someone. </p><p>Every time you get on a call. Your goal is get off it as quickly as possible. This makes it a horrible medium to collaborate. And even worse to make any real connections at work.</p><div><p>There are a bunch of new-age products that have tried to tackle this by replicating the office space like <a href="https://tandem.chat/">Tandem</a> and <a href="https://pragli.com/">Pragli</a>. By making teams aware of each others' availability, it lets people easily reach out to each other in a single click. </p><p>The problem with single-click is the ease of access people have over your work day. And if you ignore them, what it means for the team. </p></div><p>It makes your team think you're unavailable for them. Or you're slacking.This cannot just be tackled by setting your status to unavailable or away. It's like having your camera and microphone off for the entire day while you are on Zoom. </p><p>Frankly, remote work truly is a checkmate. You're fucked if you stay connected. You're fucked if try to stay away.</p><p>So how do you get out of this cluster-fuck?</p><p>How do connect with people without constantly being attached to your screen and camera?</p><p>The obvious answer is to make sure not every piece of reach-out comes with an expectation of making a connection straight away. </p><p>How do you stay productive and engaged, over being connected?</p><p>Well for starters, <em>any</em> interaction you're not part of, you should be able to consume it at a later point in the day.</p><p>You should have space to reply at your convenience. And not lose your shit to reply to every email and slack message instantly.</p><p>We also need to decouple asynchronous communication from writing. </p><p>It's bonkers. </p><div><p>The way we write is not how we talk.. </p><p>When you talk, you express in a way that is much more raw and insightful of the emotions behind what you're saying. If I am confused about something you would know. If &nbsp;I am screamingly confident about it, you would know. </p></div><p>However, people actively try to "edit" these parts out while writing. It needs to be direct and to the point. It should sound smart and convincing.. </p><p>The tone you write in can be completely different than the way you talk. And it confuses our minds on how we consume what has been written. We read it in a voice that our mind has made up. </p><div><p>Writing is too definite. Or we're not articulate enough to use it to express our emotions effectively.</p><p>And it adds to the mess.</p></div><p>It's still early days but we need to have people be themselves. Talk and chat like they would in real life. </p><div><p>But if they're disconnected from their screens, technology should fill the gap. It should bring them back to speed as quickly as possible. It should let them contribute to the conversations without worrying about taking care of notifications. </p><p>Right now, almost all the attempts seem to be focused on keeping people "engaged" to the screen.</p></div><p>We somehow need &nbsp;to let go of the <em>screen</em> bit. </p>

In 1985<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/000312240607100301"> Americans reported</a> having an average of 2.94 close friends. By 2004 this number fell to 2.08. In the same period, the number of Americans who reported having no close friends outside the family jumped from 36% to 53%. While we don't yet know the impact of quarantine on these measures, it's hard to imagine that sheltering in place is leading to improvements.</p><p>In recent years, a crop of new communities has sprung up across multiple categories that may have a shot at restoring some of America’s diminished social capital. For example:</p><figure><img src="https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-6.58.19-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-6.58.19-AM.png 600w, https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-6.58.19-AM.png 1000w, https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-6.58.19-AM.png 1600w, https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-6.58.19-AM.png 1798w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><em>Some of these communities belong in more than one category</em></figcaption></figure><p>While some of these organizations may have started with purely financial motivations, I suspect that most of their founders aspire to build communities that can replace some of the social capital that America’s waning institutions once provided. </p><p>They will, of course, have big shoes to fill. To replace the bonds that institutions like churches and labor unions once provided, our community architects will need to understand and deploy the social dynamics that have driven impactful communities for centuries.</p><p>During my time building, managing, and participating in a spectrum of thriving communities, I've learned how impactful groups are structured. In this guide, I’ll synthesize what I’ve learned into advice that you can apply to your own community and make a profound impact on the lives of your members.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="why-do-people-join-communities">Why do people join communities?</h3><p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E257S7C/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">The Innovator’s Solution</a><em>, </em>professor Clay Christensen introduced the Jobs-to-be-done theory to explain how consumers “hire” solutions to improve their lives. The theory posits that people look for the right solution to help them get from their current state to a more desirable one (smarter, loved, happier, healthier, etc.).</p><figure><img src="https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/2020/08/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/image.png 600w, https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/image.png 1000w, https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/2020/08/image.png 1278w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Image by Ash Maurya</figcaption></figure><p>Individuals typically “hire” communities to accomplish transitions that require human connection. A startup founder who wants to become a better leader applies to<a href="https://leadersintech.org/"> Leaders in Tech</a> to get the type of honest feedback needed for professional growth. The parent of a child with a rare disease might join<a href="https://themighty.com/"> The Mighty</a> to get caretaking advice from parents in similar situations.</p><p>Impactful communities have environments that make it easy for members to connect and create value for one another. Sometimes the connections themselves create most of the value. In other situations, the value comes from what gets exchanged (expertise, status, motivation, etc.) after members connect. Either way, it takes a thoughtfully designed community for these interactions to take place.</p><p>Building these types of environments isn’t easy. Unlike an app, your members can’t be programmed to consistently deliver valuable experiences for one another. That’s why it’s critical to thoughtfully design your community’s social architecture to maximize the value that gets exchanged between members.</p><h3 id="member-quality-determines-community-success">Member quality determines community success</h3><p>To visualize what makes a community successful, it can help to build a flywheel diagram to show which inputs produce positive outputs. The flywheel for a well-functioning community might look something like this:</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gqSgANYr0PNoKEs-b5nUhzbkAgM0lO0Z2EjnCZCumedI1_LMqRkxX8ifx5MkO3zqLXMX7Bp5N-qUY8jmzgCBW91d5o3KvzOGM0hV2hz8aZXbVrYEVCZoJi5WG4vw0RDBLxVB8yhJ" alt=""></figure><p>New Member demand helps the community to grow in size generating more membership dues that community leaders can invest in capabilities like events, tools, and staff. These capabilities increase and improve interactions between members, making them more likely to create value for one another and renew their memberships. A healthy member base enhances the community’s reputation, which spurs more new member demand.</p><p>However, as anyone who’s been part of a community knows, bigger communities don’t always have better member experiences. Poorly chosen members can have significant negative impacts on a community.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/xq5aP4EqyK2_2Zil8z6SmrMjoiTDVm_ib9EFXEkAbi-exhq5I88tnn_0mgefuofS8zmsfRQVcgtY8wamx35B-bcNu8GXlZuEGxqLUi7LZtL0HcF1KeYDb2AdRwBcoMFUiYnbNHyC" alt=""></figure><p>Poorly-chosen members can:</p><ul><li><strong>Make it harder for communities to invest in capabilities</strong> like events or forums, since these members are likely to abuse them.</li><li><strong>Decrease the quality of member interactions</strong> as well as the quantity (since good members may end up avoiding the group)</li><li><strong>Reduce member value</strong> by ruining group cohesion and reducing the ability of members to signal high status through their affiliation with the group</li><li><strong>Lower member retention</strong> since they diminish the value members get from the group</li><li><strong>Diminish the community’s reputation</strong> since it’s clear the group does not have a strong filter for who they admit</li><li><strong>Suppress new member demand</strong> since the community will drive less positive referrals</li></ul><p>Well-chosen members, on the other hand, can have the opposite effect on each of these variables.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/uFDWj5uDfsXDQbCymMtXbob38YOMv2MMvQR6OLOMklJHzP5zwrBw-xKTM8W0Qz24Bj1w635q92eF0waEVdZfBFCY0CqDUajs2rvire8DtP37Q7I6DFCMUI1Xj8gBP2TbGJqxaQ09" alt=""></figure><p>Context matters. While a junior UX designer might add a lot of value to a group of job seekers trying to break into the field, he likely has little to offer to a group of high-level design leaders. To determine who’s a fit, you’ll want to get an understanding of your ideal member profile and make sure the applicants you are admitting are capable of creating value for your chosen persona.</p><p>When evaluating applicants, it can help try to place them into one of the following categories:</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ExvUg0KAJFyewoUyS5WaCWeJtRwKRpjfsKO0G64Hs4EAn4ZEc_pNLNgpZCEVHO8YePykSOAUcCdhRZ_99qxV7amohXd9cVcbcDQKJSbS-iog303eThCOn_-Sj24qu6jgXyqJVA2Y" alt=""></figure><ul><li><strong>Adders</strong> will hopefully be the core of your group. They do their best to create more value than they capture and generally make the community a better place.</li><li><strong>Subtractors</strong> are those who are simply not good fits for your group because they can’t provide the type of value that other members want. If one gets through your filter, it’s not the end of the world, but you will risk damaging your member experience if this becomes a pattern.</li><li><strong>Dividers </strong>can be toxic to the point that they end up negatively impacting other members’ behavior in their orbit, creating fights, and sometimes even staging coups against group leaders. If their behavior goes unchecked, they can cause no end of trouble. If you identify one of these people in your group, get them out.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Multipliers </strong></strong></strong>are members whose positive behavior elevates everyone they come in contact with. These people are quite rare, but when you find one in your community, do anything you can to keep them.</li></ul><p>You’ll also want to consider whether each member can make a <em>distinctive</em> contribution to the rest of the group, or if they just bring more of the same. Amazon wouldn’t be a useful place to shop if it didn’t have a variety of products. Similarly, a community can’t provide much value if its members are too similar. You want to have a good assortment of people with different attitudes, skill sets, and life experiences, so your members can find better matches with one another. Prioritizing group diversity also ensures that members can find their niche and don’t feel too competitive with one another.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> <strong>Marquee Members</strong> </p><p>Marquee members are individuals who get recruited into the group based on their external prestige. Early on, you might be tempted to recruit one or two members like this to draw others into the group. However, this is a risky strategy. New members will naturally look to people with external status to determine how to behave. If your group doesn’t yet have its value delivery system figured out, you risk your marquee members disengaging from the group and spreading their attitude to others.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="be-careful-over-investing-in-community-capabilities">Be careful over-investing in community capabilities</h3><p>While members can create a good deal of value, they won’t invest time and energy into the community if they feel like they are doing all the work. That’s why as your member base grows, it’s worth investing in capabilities to help your members discover and interact with one another like:</p><ul><li><strong>Event hosting</strong> &nbsp;to throw retreats, webinars, happy hours, etc.</li><li><strong>Content production</strong> &nbsp;to publicize the accomplishments of members</li><li><strong>Member directories</strong> to enable member discovery</li><li><strong>Knowledge repositories </strong>to artifact and disseminate shared expertise</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Forum hosting </strong></strong></strong>to create spaces for questions to get asked and answered</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Chat moderation </strong></strong></strong>to promote quality interactions</li></ul><p>Most community leaders make the mistake of assuming capabilities like these provide the bulk of benefits members experience. In reality, the value they create depends on the quality of the members in the group. &nbsp;For example, if a community has a bunch of “subtractors” or “dividers,” they may use your member directory to spam the rest of the group. On the contrary, getting six “multipliers” into a well-structured Zoom conversation can create amazing results.</p><p>Another reason not to overdo it on capabilities is that they increase the costs of maintaining your community. Once introduced, costly features can be hard to roll back. No one wants to fire a staff member or discontinue a popular event series. The best solution tends to be keeping costs low until you’re sure you’ve got a sticky community that drives real demand.</p><p><strong>Pro tip: Ask your members to contribute</strong></p><p>In the early days, when money is scarce, your community can punch above its weight by having members chip in to perform various functions. Don’t be afraid to ask members to act as forum moderators or event hosts. People are hungry to …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>One year ago, Alvin Kennard stood in a Bessemer courtroom nervous and uncertain. Striped jailhouse scrubs swallowed his rail-thin, shivering frame. After 36 years in a sweltering, unairconditioned prison, the chilled air of Judge David Carpenter’s courtroom was a shock to his system.</p>
<p>What came next was a shock to the justice system.&nbsp; In 1983, Mr. Kennard had been sentenced to life without parole for a $50 robbery at a bakery. Judge Carpenter scrapped that and resentenced him to time served. A courtroom filled with Mr. Kennard’s friends and family erupted in hallelujahs. The television cameras started rolling.&nbsp; As his attorney, and a worrier by nature, I immediately started thinking about next steps: This 58-year-old man had been incarcerated nearly two-thirds of his life. How on earth was he going to adjust to the outside world?</p>
<p>Extremely well, it turned out. Alvin Kennard filed a tax return this year. He tithes at church. He hasn’t even been affected by Covid-19, other than limits on the family gatherings he loves.</p>

August 28 marks the year anniversary of his freedom from a sentence of Life Without Parole for a $50 robbery. By Bernard Troncale</p></div>
<p>Mr. Kennard’s large, supportive family was critical to his successful re-entry. A room was ready in his brother’s home. A niece, who is a Bessemer businessowner, helped with transportation. Church connections helped him secure employment within six weeks at Town and Country Ford, where he works in the body shop buffing cars. Every so often, he calls me on his lunch break and lets me know things are still going just fine. &nbsp;During the holidays, he texted me photos of him at the staff holiday party, standing next to a huge inflatable polar bear. Imagine returning from Alabama’s hellish prisons to a world where holidays are filled with enormous glowing inflatables. Mr. Kennard embraces it all – with joy.</p>
<p>“It’s almost a year I’ve had my job,” he remarked recently. “It’s been a blessing, it’s been wonderful. It’s not about how much money I’m making, it’s about what God allowed me to do.”</p>
<p>He loves listening to the birds chatter in the mornings, wandering down to the creek of his childhood and watching turtles and snakes. He’s got a favorite meat-and-three restaurant, Kayla’s, that’s helped him put on much-needed weight.</p>

<p>All conversations with Alvin Kennard eventually lead toward God. No matter how hard I try to give him credit for how hard he worked, how much he suffered, how he deserves a good life, he invokes God and the conversation becomes a prayer.</p>
<p>I wish more Alabama legislators, judges, and prosecutors could pray with Mr. Kennard.</p>
<p>Until last year, he was labeled a “violent felon” based on his robbery conviction at age 22.&nbsp; Because of three minor non-violent convictions stemming from the same arrest at age 18, he was labeled a habitual offender.&nbsp; Based on the calls and mail that poured into Alabama Appleseed’s office following news of Mr. Kennard’s freedom, there is a world out there that does not see him as a violent felon. &nbsp;“A few month ago, I heard about you. My father was from Alabama, Bessemer, too,” wrote Elizabeth, from Spokane, Washington, who mailed him a little cash – “a gift, so that your days moving forward are hopeful, full of love and belonging.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth acknowledged something else about Mr. Kennard’s story: “I’m learning more about how horrible the police and jail systems are (&amp; the laws, too). It’s not new … but the depth of the corrupt mission is being seen.”</p>
<p>At Appleseed, we’ve also gotten mail from those still stranded in prison honor dorms. Men in their 60s, 70s, one who is 86, sentenced to die in prison for the sins of their youth under Alabama’s draconian Habitual Felony Offender Law. They tell us about their kidney problems, their high blood pressure, their crack-cocaine addictions from the 1980s that led to convenience-store hold ups and courthouse decisions that they were forever beyond redemption. Except now, they are the prisons’ hospice workers, GED teachers, barbers, launderers, preachers, peacemakers, and clean-up crew.&nbsp; “The [whole] time I’ve been in, I’ve worked as a hall runner, shift office runner, infirmary runner and have seen so much brutal violence and had to clean up so much blood out of cells, off of walls and hallways and had to help pick up dead inmates or seem dead and get them to the infirmary,” wrote one man whose conviction dates back to the first Bush Presidency. “I’ve had so much prison blood on my hands, I see it in my sleep.”</p>
<p>Due to the limitations and complexities of Alabama criminal procedure, there is currently no clear vehicle for second chances for these old men in the honor dorms. &nbsp;Mr. Kennard is free only through extraordinary mercy and grace from Judge Carpenter and the Bessemer Cutoff District Attorney’s Office led by Lynneice Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. Kennard turns 60 this year. He will celebrate a full year of employment and get a week’s paid vacation. Most likely he’ll purchase a new suit or two. If there’s one thing I’ve learned about Mr. Kennard this year – beyond his faith and his work ethic – is that he is a sharp dresser, which makes it all the more unfortunate that the cameras were rolling on him while he wore faded jailhouse scrubs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A common strategy to make any system super-performant is <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)">Caching</a>.</em> Almost all software products, operating at scale, have multiple layers of caches in their architectures. Caching, when done right, does wonder to the response time and is one of the main reasons why products work so well at a massive scale. Cache engines are limited by the amount of memory available and hence once it gets full the engine has to decide which item should be evicted and that is where an eviction algorithm, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_frequently_used">LFU</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)">LRU</a>. kicks in.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)">LRU</a> (Least Recently Used) cache eviction strategy is one of the most popular strategies out there. LFU (Least Frequently Used) strategy fares well in some use cases but a concern with its most popular implementation, where it uses a min-heap, is that it provides a running time complexity of <code>O(log n)</code> for all the three operations - insert, update and delete; because of which, more often than not, it is replaced with a sub-optimal yet extremely fast <code>O(1)</code> LRU eviction scheme.</p>
<p>In this essay, we take a look at Constant Time LFU implementation based on the paper <a href="http://dhruvbird.com/lfu.pdf">An O(1) algorithm for implementing the LFU cache eviction scheme</a> by Prof. Ketan Shah, Anirban Mitra and Dhruv Matani, where instead of using a min-heap, it uses a combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list">doubly-linked lists</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash table</a> to gain a running time complexity of <code>O(1)</code> for all the three core operations.</p>

<p>LFU, very commonly, is implemented using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min-max_heap">min-heap</a> which is organized as per the frequency of access of each element. Each element of this heap holds a pair - cached value and the access frequency; and is structured in order of this frequency such that the cached value with the minimum access frequency sits at the top, making it quick to identify the element to be evicted.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/89717235-0fd1f900-d9d2-11ea-968d-9ed67f52a2db.png" alt="min-heap LFU"></p>
<p>Although the identification of the element to be evicted is quick, but in order for the heap to maintain its property - element with lowest access frequency be at the top - it demands a rebalance, and this rebalancing process has a running complexity of <code>O(log n)</code>. To make things worse, rebalancing is required every single time the frequency of an item is changed; which means that in the cache that implements LFU, every time an item is either inserted, accessed or evicted, a rebalance is required - making all the three core operations to have the time complexity of <code>O(log n)</code>.</p>

<p>The LFU cache can be implemented with <code>O(1)</code> complexity for all the three operations by using one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">Hash Table</a> and a bunch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list">Doubly Linked Lists</a>. As stated by the <a href="https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/rum">RUM Conjecture</a>, in order to get a constant time reads and updates operations, we have to make a compromise with memory utilization. This is exactly what we observe in this implementation.</p>
<h2>The Hash Table</h2>
<p>The Hash Table stores the mapping of the cached key to the Value Node holding the cached value. The value against the key is usually a pointer to the actual Value Node. Given that the lookup complexity of the hash table is <code>O(1)</code>, the operation to access the value given the key from this Hash Table could be accomplished in constant time.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/90469594-e2561f80-e136-11ea-9ff4-8369a7ea3df3.png" alt="LFU hash table"></p>
<p>The illustration above depicts that the Hash Table holding cache keys <code>k1</code>, <code>k2</code>, etc are mapped to the nodes holding the values <code>v1</code> and <code>v2</code> through direct pointers. The nodes are allocated on the heap using dynamic allocation, hence are a little disorganized. The Value Node to which the key maps to, not only hold the cached value, but it also holds a few pointers pointing to different entities in the system, enabling constant-time operations.</p>
<h2>Doubly Linked Lists</h2>
<p>This implementation of LFU requires us to maintain one Doubly Linked List of frequencies, called <code>freq_list</code>, holding one node for each unique frequency spanning all the caches values. This list is kept sorted on the frequency the node represents such that, the node representing the lowest frequency is on the one end while the node representing the highest frequency is at the other.</p>
<p>Every Frequency Node holds the frequency that it represents in the member <code>freq</code> and the usual <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> pointers pointing to the adjacent Frequency Nodes; it also keeps a <code>values_ptr</code> which points to another doubly-linked list holding Value Nodes (referred in the hash table) having the same access frequency <code>freq</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/90469593-e08c5c00-e136-11ea-995b-e4590981dd89.png" alt="lists LFU"></p>
<p>The overall schematic representation of doubly-linked lists and its arrangement is as shown in the illustration above. The doubly-linked list holding Frequency Nodes is arranged horizontally while the list holding the Value Nodes is arranged vertically, for clearer view and understanding.</p>
<p>Since the cached values <code>v1</code> and <code>v7</code> both have been accessed <code>7</code> times, they both are chained in a doubly-linked list and are hooked with the Frequency Node representing the frequency of <code>7</code>. Similarly, the Value Nodes holding values <code>v5</code>, <code>v3</code>, and <code>v9</code> are chained in another doubly-linked list and are hooked with the Frequency Node representing the frequency of <code>18</code>.</p>
<p>The Value Node contains the cached value in member <code>data</code>, along with the usual <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> pointers pointing to the adjacent Value Nodes in the list. It also holds a <code>freq_pointer</code> pointing back to the Frequency Node to which the list if hooked at. Having all of these pointers helps us ensure all the three operations happen in constant time.</p>
<p>Now that we have put all the necessary structures in place, we take a look at the 3 core operations along with their pseudo implementation.</p>
<h2>Adding value to the cache</h2>
<p>Adding a new value to the cache is a relatively simpler operation that requires a bunch of pointer manipulations and does the job with a constant time running complexity. While inserting the value in the cache, we first check the existence of the key in the table, if the key is already present and we try to put it again the function raises an error. Then we ensure the presence of the Frequency Node representing the frequency of <code>1</code>, and in the process, we might also need to create a new frequency node also. Then we wrap the value in a Value Node and adds it to the <code>values_list</code> of this Frequency Node; and at last, we make an entry in the table acknowledging the completion of the caching process.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(key: str, value: object)</span>:</span>
    
    
    <span>if</span> key <span>in</span> table:
        <span>raise</span> KeyAlreadyExistsError

    
    
    value_node = make_value_node(value)

    first_frequency_node = freq_list.head
    <span>if</span> first_frequency_node.freq != <span>1</span>:
        
        
        first_frequency_node = make_frequency_node(<span>1</span>)

        
        
        
        first_frequency_node.next = freq_list.head
        freq_list.head.prev = first_frequency_node
        freq_list.head = first_frequency_node

    
    value_node.freq_pointer = first_frequency_node

    
    first_frequency_node.values.add(value_node)

    
    table[key] = value_node
</code></pre>
<p>As seen in the pseudocode above the entire procedure to add a new value in the cache is a bunch of memory allocation along with some pointer manipulations, hence we observe that the running complexity of <code>O(1)</code> for this operation.</p>
<h2>Evicting an item from the cache</h2>
<p>Eviction, similar to insertion, is a trivial operation where we simply pick the frequency node with lowest access frequency (the first node in the <code>freq_list</code>) and remove the first Value Node present in its <code>values_list</code>. Since the entire eviction also requires pointer manipulations, it also exhibits a running complexity of <code>O(1)</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>evict</span><span>()</span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> freq_list.head <span>and</span> freq_list.head.values:
        first_value_node = freq_list.head.values.first
        second_value_node = first_value_node.next

        
        freq_list.head = second_value_node

        
        second_value_node.prev = <span>None</span>

        
        delete_value_node(first_value_node)

    <span>if</span> freq_list.head <span>and</span> <span>not</span> freq_list.head.values:
        
        
        delete_frequency_node(freq_list.head)
</code></pre>
<h2>Getting a value from the cache</h2>
<p>Accessing an item from the cache has to be the most common operation of any cache. In the LFU scheme, before returning the cached value, the engine also has to update its access frequency. Ensuring the change in access frequency of one cached value does not require some sort of rebalancing or restructuring to maintain the integrity, is what makes this implementation special.</p>
<p>The engine first makes a get call to the Hash Table to check that the key exists in the cache. Before returning the cached value from the retrieved Value Node, the engine performs the following operations - it accesses the Frequency Node and its sibling corresponding to the retrieved Value Node. It ensures that the frequency of the sibling is 1 more than that of the Frequency Node; if not it creates the necessary Frequency Node and place it as the new sibling. The Value Node then changes its affinity to this sibling Frequency Node so that it correctly matches the access frequency. In the end, the back pointer from the Value Node to the new Frequency Node is set and the value is returned.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>get</span><span>(key: str)</span> -&gt; object:</span>
    
    value_node = table.get(key, <span>None</span>)

    
    
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> value_node:
        <span>raise</span> KeyNotFoundError

    
    
    frequency_node = value_node.freq_pointer

    
    
    
    next_frequency_node = frequency_node.next

    <span>if</span> next_frequency_node.freq != frequency_node.freq + <span>1</span>:
        
        new_frequency_node = make_frequency_node(frequency_node.freq + <span>1</span>)
        
        
        frequency_node.next = new_frequency_node
        new_frequency_node.prev = frequency_node

        next_frequency_node.prev = new_frequency_node
        new_frequency_node.next = frequency_node

        
        
        next_frequency_node = new_frequency_node

    
    next_frequency_node.values.add(value_node)
    
    
    value_node.freq_pointer = next_frequency_node
    value_node.next = <span>None</span>
    value_node.prev = next_frequency_node.values.last
    
    
    
    <span>if</span> len(frequency_node.values) == <span>0</span>:
        delete_frequency_node(frequency_node)

    
    <span>return</span> value_node.value
</code></pre>
<p>Again, since this operation also only deals with pointer manipulations through direct pointers, the running time complexity of this operation is also constant …</p></div></div></div>

<p>The US market indexes entered bear market territory in March of 2020. It has been a long time since the US has experienced a bear market, 13 years to be precise.  Since the best way to learn about the present is to look at the past, it is a good time for comparing the last 10 bear markets before 2020.</p>



<p>They range in time from 1956 to 2020 and lasted between 18 and 87 months before a total recovery was achieved.  By almost any measurement, the current 2020 bear market is the mildest on record so far.  Lets look at the last 10 bear markets.</p>

<p>Looking at the data quite a few things stand out.  The average bear market lasts 42 months overall, but sees 35% drop in the stock market over 14 months before it recovers.  Lets look a little closer.</p>



<h3>How Often Do Bear Markets Occur</h3>



<p>Between 1956 and 2020 there have been a total of 10 bear markets.  This is spread out over 64 years for an average of 6.4 years between markets.   Our last bear market was all the way back in 2007, or 13 years ago.   </p>



<p>By the laws of averages we were way overdue.  Previously, the last longest time between bear markets was also 13 years with the bear market starting in 2000.  Also note, the 2000  bear market saw the second largest drop on record of 49.1%!</p>



<h3>How Long Do Bear Markets Take to Bottom Out</h3>



<p>Bear markets bottomed out over an average of 14 months from the time they begun.  The fastest a market every bottomed out was in 1987 with 3 months. </p>



<p>If the current bear market has bottomed out, and don’t assume it has, it would win the fastest drop to the bottom at a rapid 2 months.</p>



<h3>How Much Do Stocks End Up Dropping</h3>



<p>On average a bear market sees a 35% decline from peak to trough.  The all time peak was 56.8% caused by the great financial crises created by the housing bubble of 2007.</p>



<p>By comparison, 2020’s current max drop of -26.7% from peak is pretty tame.    Don’t assume that stocks have found the bottom though, as of August 2020 this is still a very young bear market.</p>



<h3>How Long Do They Last</h3>



<p>Bear market last 42 months on average, with the shortest on record at 18 months.  This is bad news for those that believe the 2020 bear market is already over.  If this ends up being true, it would be by far the shortest bear market on record.  Let’s just hope we don’t end up at 87 months, which is the longest on record.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>It is interesting to look back in time comparing the last 10 US stock bear markets.  It is impossible to say how bad the current bear market will get or how long it will last, but judging from the past bear markets it is likely not over yet.  </p>



<p>Considering the economic turmoil that we may still yet have in front of us, it is a good time to review your financial positions and make sure you are comfortable you can weather the storm.  Make sure your assets are diversified and that you are comfortable with your risk profile.  You should be very careful with any <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/speculating-vs-investing/">speculative</a> holdings that risk total loss.</p>

<p>Smart people have been thinking on how to create IT architectures as long as there has been computers. Ideas come and go, however creating a good architectures can still be complex and time consuming. Especially when you try to invent the wheel for yourself. With this interactive playbook you can create your IT architecture better and faster. The focus of this architecture playbook is in on:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Knowledge reuse. Why reinvent the wheel again? It is far and more fun to create a better wheel for your organisation or IT project instead! Focus on the hard complex context specific issues. Use good open tools and knowledge for the easy 80%!</p></li>
<li><p>Easier creation of architecture documents and deliverables. This playbook has an extensive list of all(*) open tools available for creating your IT architecture or design. Using these open tools will speed up the process of creating your architecture deliverables and reduce your risks.</p></li>
<li><p>Quality improvement. By making use of content parts provided for various architecture deliverables you will lower your business risks. Complex business IT projects will fail. Now and in future. But if you make use of proven methods and tools developed from decades of IT architecture scientific research you will lower the risk for your project. Architecture will help to make your projects more successful in terms of costs, speed and profitability.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(*) If you miss a good open tool that is also usable for IT architecture creation, do not hesitate to contribute to this open publication!</p>
<p>This architecture playbook is divided in the commonly used architecture sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Business</p></li>
<li><p>Data</p></li>
<li><p>Applications and of course</p></li>
<li><p>Technology Infrastructure (TI)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This playbook is primarily created for on-line usage. But also ePUB and PDF versions are available.</p>
<div id="why-this-architecture-playbook">
<h2>Why this architecture playbook?<a href="#why-this-architecture-playbook" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Creating a business IT architecture has many benefits. However creating a complete architecture is known to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Difficult</p></li>
<li><p>Time consuming</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course many tools have been developed the last 30 years to make creating architecture (documents) easier. However many tools force you into a very tight harness without the needed flexibility. Complex problems need flexible solutions and tools should not slow you down in creating sketches, documents and typical architecture deliverables. A one size fits tool for solving complex business IT problems does not exist. And since creating good architectures is knowledge intensive work that delivers real value for business you should be aware of vendor lock-ins and using methods and tools that do not share knowledge sharing. Open Source tools and open access documentation offer a default head start for reuse and improvement of knowledge work in IT architecture.</p>
<p>You can buy and read many many books on how to do architecture well. All books claim a magic method and promise ultimate success when followed. We love books and reading methods. E.g. TOGAF.  However this playbook is different. This architecture playbook is not about describing how you should create your architecture. You are free to use every method you want. This architecture playbook is all about giving you direct usable content and tools that you can use and reuse for your architecture challenge.</p>
<p>So this playbook brings you ultimate freedom and flexibility. You can export the results from certain tools in any desired format. In this way you can still use your architecture enterprise tool(s) that you already have invested deeply in. So use the outcome of tools within this playbook in combination with the enterprise architecture tool that are mandatory within your organisation.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-in-this-architecture-playbook">
<h2>What is in this architecture playbook?<a href="#what-is-in-this-architecture-playbook" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many good books and courses already exist that cover the why and how of (Enterprise) IT architecture. So this book will not explain aspects and concepts of the very broad field of IT architecture. This playbook is targeted on providing practical tools for creating your IT architecture or design faster and better. So the focus is 100% on the real thing by using the following leading principles:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Tools that speed up creating your business IT Architecture.</p></li>
<li><p>Collections of principles, requirements, standards and reference architecture that speed up the creation of your architecture deliverable.</p></li>
<li><p>Collection of various Architecture OSS Tools that speed up creating your business IT architecture.</p></li>
<li><p>Collection of architecture QA  tools to control and manage your IT projects.</p></li>
<li><p>Collection of reusable reference architectures, foundation architecture, architecture journals and more. Knowing where you can find what in an easy way will reduce your time. So you will have more time to spend on solving your problem in your organization.</p></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p><span>Link building is the process of getting other websites to link back to your website. These links, called backlinks, are essential in how Google determines which websites rank for which keywords. In fact, after studying 11.8 million SERP results, </span><a href="https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking"><span>one study</span></a><span> found </span><b>the number of domains linking to a page correlated with rankings more than any other factor. </b><span>Every business owner should be interested in building links to drive referral traffic and increase their site’s authority.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Link building can be one of the more challenging aspects of SEO. In this post, we’ll answer how to do link building, and walk you through 8 actionable strategies to get a ton of high-quality links to your site.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Best Link Building Tactics&nbsp;</span></h2>
<h3><b>1. Blog commenting&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><span>Building links on blogs could be as easy as leaving a valuable message in the “comments” section of a blog. The sooner you leave a comment after the blog publishes, the better.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Blog comments also come with two other great benefits:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>They help you build relationships within online communities.</span></li>
<li><span>They offer targeted traffic back to your website.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>One thing to note is that the comment submission box must have a field to add your website.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img src="https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Comment-form-e1598203782633.png" alt="The comment submission box must have a field to add your website." width="602" height="442"></p>
<p><span>The website field means you can include a link back to your site, that anyone who reads your comment can click. </span><b>Google notices when you get links back from your comments on large, well-established </b><b>blogs</b><b>.</b><span> According to</span> <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/blog-comments-links/"><span>this study from Neil Patel</span></a><span>, </span><span>links from high authority sites, even through user-generated content, help with rankings.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you choose to use this tactic, you’ll want to focus on blogs that allow Dofollow links in comments. Google uses Dofollow links to figure out how many users link to your page and determine your website’s authority. The more Dofollow links you have, the higher you’ll show up on Google search.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you aren’t sure how to find blogs that allow DoFollow links, Google search the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>“Dofollow blogs” – you’ll discover articles listing out blogs that have Dofollow links.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><a href="http://followlist.com/"><span>Followlist</span></a><span> – use this directory to find blogs that have Dofollow links.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Actively comment on your niche’s blog posts, and be sure your comment adds value to the topic of the blog. Posting spammy links will just cause your comment to be removed.</span></p>
<h3><b>2. </b> <b>Expert roundup</b></h3>
<p><span>Building alliances with companies that offer products that are complementary to yours or influencers in your space give you a win-win relationship.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Sharing the opinions of leaders in your industry via an expert roundup blog post will help you build backlinks, boost your website’s traffic, and add SEO value.</b></p>
<p><span>This type of blog post gets a lot of traffic since the experts who are part of the roundup sometimes share the content with their audience. And as an industry expert, they likely have a large following.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since roundups are valuable pieces of content, they have a higher chance of being shared by other people, </span><i><span>even if they weren’t one of the contributors</span></i><span>. Plus, the backlinks you’ll get from major websites will boost your domain authority and search ranking.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To create an expert roundup post, think about a topic relevant to your industry that you’ve always wanted to discuss. Ask the most relevant questions about the topic in your blog post, and answer them with experts in your field.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Consider using a tool like </span><a href="https://ninjaoutreach.com/"><span>Ninja Outreach</span></a><span> to find and reach out to industry leaders if you’re not sure where to find experts for your roundup post.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>3. </b> <b>Ego bait</b></h3>
<p><span>Who doesn’t love a little ego boost?</span></p>
<p><span>The ‘ego bait’ link building tactic is similar to the expert roundup strategy. </span><b>If you positively feature another person on your website or blog, they’re more likely to return the favor.</b></p>
<p><span>Like most people, experts and influencers want to be recognized for their accomplishments and skills. By sharing those accomplishments with your audience, you inspire those experts to share your content and link to your website.</span><span> The key here is creating content around a specific person, business, or group of people.</span></p>
<p><span>The main types of ego bait content are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Interviews</span></li>
<li><span>Roundup Posts</span></li>
<li><span>Listicles</span></li>
<li><span>Directories</span></li>
<li><span>Awards</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>For example, if your business is a small tech startup, you can make a “51 Game Changers in Tech You Should Follow” list and mention different personalities and websites. They’ll appreciate it and probably will share the content with a link. Pick the right type of content and industry leaders from complementary businesses to reach your SEO goals.</span></p>
<h3><b>4. </b> <b>Local directories</b></h3>
<p><span>Adding your business to an online directory is an easy way to build links and draw traffic to your site.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>People use online directories to locate businesses that sell what they’re shopping for at that very moment—</span><b>since directories index businesses by niche, location, and category, adding your website to a directory attracts highly-targeted (and high purchase-intent) traffic to your website.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>You increase your chances of sales by having your business listed in a directory, and you also boost your business’ visibility. Online directories are trusted sources and are typically high-ranking on Google.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Most of the time, adding your business to a directory costs you nothing. Many online directories – for example, </span><a href="https://www.bingplaces.com/"><span>Bing Places</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://biz.yelp.com/"><span>Yelp</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://foursquare.com/"><span>Foursquare</span></a><span> – allow you to submit your business information for free. Still, some online directories do charge a listing fee.</span></p>
<p><b>Choose a directory relevant to your niche, and the chances of reaching your target audience and boosting your SEO will be much higher.</b></p>
<h3><b>5. </b> <b>Brand mentions</b></h3>
<p><b>Unlinked brand mentions are when people mention your brand online without linking to your website–which means you’re already halfway towards earning a link. </b><span>The blogger already knows of your business; thus, you have the perfect excuse to reach out and ask for a link back to your site.</span></p>
<p><span>What kind of mentions can you link back to? Anything that mentions you or your brand can serve as a backlink, for example, product names, services, slogans, and even your name.</span></p>
<p><span>To start, create a list of any unique products, services, and brand representatives for your business. Then, you can search them on Google or use a tool like </span><a href="https://ahrefs.com/content-explorer"><span>Ahrefs Content Explorer</span></a><span> to find mentions of your brand online. If you are building awareness and already started doing some traditional marketing, such as press releases, you’ll likely find articles where you or your brand is mentioned online.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A few rules before asking for a link: first, don’t be pushy. Ask yourself if adding a link makes sense within the context of the article. Secondly, don’t request links if they don’t add value. If the article expresses an unfavorable or critical opinion of your brand, you probably shouldn’t ask for a link. Last, always offer value. If something could be expanded on or improved in the article, don’t be afraid to mention it in your email outreach. Using these three rules, you’re more likely to get a favorable response when you ask for a link to your website.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>6. </b> <b>Sponsorships</b></h3>
<p><span>If you want, you can secure backlinks from local projects or causes you already support. </span><b>Many cause-based sites have pages dedicated to donors where they show their sponsors’ logos and link to their websites.</b></p>
<p><i><span>Different sponsorship opportunities</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Sponsoring an event</b><span> to get publicity and brand visibility.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Consider sponsoring a podcast</b><span> or a webinar. You may get a backlink from it.</span></li>
<li><b>Conference sponsorships</b><span> get your name in front of a niche audience.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Non-profit sponsorships</b><span> stand for a great cause while also helping you achieve an authoritative link.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>7. </b> <b>Link building tools</b></h3>
<p><b>Link building tools can help you to find backlink opportunities.</b><span> If you have some money to spend on tools, we have some useful options:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.buzzstream.com/"><b>BuzzStream</b></a><span> is a perfect tool to create a list of prospects and do outreach for them.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://ahrefs.com/"><b>Ahrefs</b></a><span> is a tool you can use to analyze backlinks from any site and look for relevant content and keywords.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><a href="https://moz.com/moz-pro-free-trial"><b>Moz</b></a><span> is great for prospecting for expert roundups or even want to add external links to your articles. You can use </span><a href="https://moz.com/products/pro/seo-toolbar"><span>MozBar</span></a><span> to know the domain authority of each one directly from the Google results page.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>8. </b> <b>Guest blogging</b></h3>
<p><b>Guest posts are probably the number one way companies look for backlinks</b><span>. But is the </span><a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/what-is-link-equity"><span>link equity</span></a><span>&nbsp;being passed to your site? Unlikely — but maybe.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>John Mueller, a Google senior webmaster trends analyst, recently said on </span><a href="https://twitter.com/JohnMu/status/1271697162762686464"><span>Twitter</span></a><span> that links within guest blog posts or contributed content should be </span><a href="https://backlinko.com/nofollow-link"><span>nofollowed</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Essentially if the link is within the guest post, it should be nofollow, even if it’s a “natural” link you’re adding there.</p>
<p>FWIW none of this is new, and I’m not aware of any plans to ramp up manual reviews of this. We catch most of these algorithmically anyway.</p>
<p>— 🍌 John 🍌 (@JohnMu) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnMu/status/1271697162762686464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2020</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span>Still, many SEOs still believe in the power of guest posting. Google somehow still counts those links, and there’s no question may marketers have seen benefits from these opportunities. Whether it be SERP improvements, increased traffic — or most importantly, more leads.</span></p>
<p><span>A </span><a href="https://twitter.com/dejanseo/status/1271602260120760320"><span>poll</span></a><span> by SEO marketer, Dan Petrovic, showed that many SEO experts use guest blogging to build links. </span></p>
<p><img src="https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dan-Petrovic-tweet.png" alt=" Dan Petrovic showed that many SEO experts use guest blogging to build links." width="602" height="316" srcset="https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dan-Petrovic-tweet.png 1180w, https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dan-Petrovic-tweet-300x158.png 300w, https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dan-Petrovic-tweet-768x404.png 768w, https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dan-Petrovic-tweet-1024x538.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px"></p>
<p><span>When you write a guest post for another site, you’re proving you’re an expert. You’re also offering quality content to a similar audience in another site (meaning probably they’re going to visit your website). Just because Google’s algorithms may ignore the link doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it. Guest blogging could be very valuable for your company.&nbsp; There are many ways you can find </span><a href="https://loganix.com/guest-blogging-opportunities/"><span>guest blogging opportunities</span></a><span>. Adam Steele of Loganix gives these guest blog tips:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Google search modifiers.</b><span> You can find great things using the advanced search in Google. Here are some examples of search combinations you can try:</span></li>

<ul>
<li><b></b><b>Join and contribute to online communities</b><span>, like Reddit and Quora, or even groups in LinkedIn and Facebook. It’s essential to be an active member.</span></li>
<li><b>Social searches.</b><span> On Twitter, you can find shared guest posts about specific topics.</span></li>
<li><b>Use competitor backlinks.</b><span> If they already accepted a guest post from a competitor, there’s a good chance they’ll accept one from you as well. You can find …</span></li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><img width="1080" height="634" src="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ft-testing-automation.jpg" alt="5 rules for successful test automation" srcset="https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ft-testing-automation.jpg 1080w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ft-testing-automation-300x176.jpg 300w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ft-testing-automation-1024x601.jpg 1024w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ft-testing-automation-768x451.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px">      </p>	  
    
        <blockquote><p>The key to successful use of test-automation tools is to correctly calibrate expectations: Recognize what the software can do and be equally aware of what it cannot do. That helps you make useful decisions in the most important areas: what can and should be automated, how it should be done, and who should do it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The purpose of automated testing is to help people work smarter. Use test automation to take the development effort where humans can’t go, and amplify the testing of good testers.</p>
<p>Despite the field’s established history, some CIOs and managers expect test automation to fully automate all product testing, magically create 100% code coverage, and catch all bugs. Not to mention a secret belief that they can fire all the talented people and hire a chimp.</p>
<h3>1. Automation reflects a process; it doesn’t replace it</h3>
<p>Don’t confuse <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/automated-functional-testing-101/">test automation</a> with vendor tools. However good they are – and we do like to think that Functionize exemplifies the best possible options! – any tool can only help you improve a process. Think of a kitchen blender, which is a more efficient way to combine ingredients than is a mortar and pestle. Or consider carpentry: Power tools help a carpenter build a house faster than with hand tools, but she doesn’t just sit back and watch the tools build the house by themselves.</p>
<p>Rather, approach test automation as a way to test applications for conformance to the QA criteria by which you judge software as ready to release. The tools allow you to submit input, capture output, and compare it against a baseline. In other words, test automation tools merely automate a process you already (we hope) have in place.</p>
<p>That’s the danger and the opportunity. Automating a good process shows how good that process is. Automating a bad process amplifies its weaknesses.</p>
<h3>2. It’s another development project</h3>
<p>Treat the test-automation project like any other development project. That means putting together specifications on what it will and will not do, how the code/modules are designed, and so on.</p>
<p>The automation needs to be planned, managed, monitored and supported just like a real application development project. It’s just another kind of product development, and thus beholden to the same rules and processes as any other type of software development project.</p>
<h3>3. Automate the right things</h3>
<p>Test automation is an ideal solution in several situations, but don’t force these tools into the wrong role. Among the positive points: It is a good way to get repeatable tests, to expand application coverage, to speed up tests on subsequent versions of the application, and to do <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/regression-testing-what-you-need-to-know/">regression testing</a>.</p>
<p>But it is automation, not automagic. Don’t expect to automate everything. Some tasks inherently require manual testing.</p>
<p>The testing part still belongs to the testers. Those professionals are responsible for coming up with appropriate input to exercise the application, working out whether the output is both correct and according to spec, and looking for bugs.</p>
<h3>4. Get the right people</h3>
<p>Apparently, many managers assume that because the automation tools do all the work, an intern can run the software. This attitude gets professional testers’ shorts tied in a knot.</p>
<p>“Get the right staff,” one tester insisted. “This type of work requires the right type of skills and knowledge. Testers need to know how to write code, how the application under test is built, and how to do testing.”</p>
<p>For any nontrivial test-automation project, <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/5-reasons-why-qa-needs-humans/">you need dedicated personnel</a>. As long as the developers have to split their time between automated and manual testing responsibilities, the test-automation effort never really gets up and going in a truly successful manner.</p>
<h3>5. Design applications to be tested</h3>
<p>Automated or no, QA tests don’t come out of nowhere. Programmers should create their applications with testability in mind, or at least with clear communication among the business subject-matter experts, the development staff, and the QA team.</p>
<p>One example of the design-for-test approach is for QA staff to set conventions that developers follow. For example, get developers to always guarantee a unique way of identifying an object. It can be its associated text, a title, a unique ID, etc. Once you have this standard set, see if the test tool has options for setting the order in which it picks an identifiers.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can slow down the testing process. “The main difficulty I faced was the inconsistency of the different warning or error messages the product was returning to the user,” a tester told me. “The same message window was used either for a warning or a error, but from the automation point of view it was really hard to figure out if you should list the run as successful or as a failure,” she added.</p>
<blockquote><p>The promise of continuous testing is faster delivery of higher quality software. Our white paper explains <a href="https://www.functionize.com/project/continuous-testing-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/">how it works</a>.</p></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><article><main><a href="https://pento.ai/blog/terran-meets-streamlit-components"><p>Terran's face recognition meets Streamlit Components</p></a></main><p>We can’t believe Streamlit is barely one year old now. Today, we can’t think of any better tool for creating a fast and interactive dashboard, demos, and visualizations. On top of that, they recently launched a new awesome feature called <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/components">Streamlit Components</a>. This new feature enables developers to create custom visualizations using your favorite front-end framework, namely React, Vue, or just plain HTML.</p><p>Especially, Streamlit is really convenient when starting new machine learning projects, making it super easy and fast to go from nothing to a proof of concept of a ML solution. Because of this, we use Streamlit pretty frequently: for project prototyping, dynamic reports, and for building cool demos 💅</p><p>Particularly, our open-source project Terran was not an exception to this. We've built a face-recognition timeline demo to demonstrate how easy it is to use Terran on YouTube videos, and additionally, how straightforward it is to create amazing visualizations using the new Streamlit Components! 🚀</p><p>In this blog post, we'll share how the process of building this component was, and hopefully, inspire you to build your own component or demo using Terran!</p><p>Our demo consists of the following:</p><ol><li>You take any video from YouTube that has people in it, for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/mbdOqxdiSZc" target="blank" rel="noopener">this Big Bang Theory video</a>.</li><li>Then, we use Terran to detect all the faces that appear in the video, and when they actually appear on the screen.</li><li>Finally, we create a timeline visualization that shows in green when someone is present in the video.</li><li>Optionally, we can make it dynamic so that when the user clicks on a specific time of the timeline, a video player is rendered and it'll begin playing starting from the second the user clicked.</li></ol><p>The final result looks like this</p><a id="what_is_terran" href="#what_is_terran"></a><p><img src="https://pento.ai/images/blog/terran-square.svg" alt="Terran face-recognition timeline"></p><p>Terran is our open-source human perception library. We focus on providing open, auditable, and performant alternatives to closed approaches. Solutions that can run on your computer or device and that will adapt to the environment that it's in. But most importantly, code that you can test (without piling-up costs), understand and modify to your needs.</p><p>You can check out the <a href="https://pento.ai/blog/introducing-terran">Terran's introduction blog post</a> to know more about this project! Also, you can support our project and give it a try and why not a star in Github 💫</p><a id="using_terran's_face-recognition_modules" href="#using_terran's_face-recognition_modules"></a><p>The demo consists of automatically detecting and tracking faces on YouTube videos. With this information, we can generate timeline charts showing specifically when each person appears on the screen or not. The idea then is to use Terran's face-recognition library to generate all the data needed to create a timeline visualization, and then we can create a new Streamlit Component to create a fancy and interactive timeline chart!</p><p>We can split the processes into the following steps:</p><ol><li>Generate the timeline data from a YouTube video using Terran</li><li>Bootstrapping your Streamlit Component and declare the input/output data bindings</li><li>And creating a custom and interactive visualization tool using React and D3</li></ol><p>Let's dive in!</p><a id="generate_the_timeline_data_from_a_youtube_video_using_terran" href="#generate_the_timeline_data_from_a_youtube_video_using_terran"><h2>Generate the timeline data from a YouTube video using Terran</h2></a><p>This is pretty simple. Using Terran's <code>open_video</code> we will iterate through the video's frames, and using the functions <code>face_detection</code> and <code>extract_features</code> we'll detect for each frame where the faces are and a vector representation -features- of each face.</p><p><img src="https://pento.ai/images/blog/terran-streamlit-diagram.jpg" alt="Terran Streamlit timeline generator diagram"></p><p>Then, we can start comparing the extracted features to know if we're talking about the same person or not, we can do a simple <code>cosine_distance</code> threshold to know if that's the case.</p><p>Finally, we create a data structure that stores for each detected person all the frame indexes in which they appear, and that's it!</p><p><img src="https://pento.ai/images/blog/terran-streamlit-structure.jpg" alt="Terran Streamlit timeline generator data structure"></p><p>We created a function <code>generate_timeline</code> that does this exact same logic, plus some other minor features. When being used, it looks as simple as this:</p><pre><pre><code>from streamlit_terran_timeline import generate_timeline

timeline = generate_timeline("https://youtu.be/mbdOqxdiSZc")
</code></pre></pre><a id="bootstrap_your_streamlit_component_and_declare_the_input/output_data_bindings" href="#bootstrap_your_streamlit_component_and_declare_the_input/output_data_bindings"><h2>Bootstrap your Streamlit Component and declare the input/output data bindings</h2></a><p>This step might work differently for you depending on your frontend skills. In particular, we're more into working with React, so this <a href="https://github.com/streamlit/component-template/tree/master/template">Streamlit Component template</a> was great for setting up the demo.</p><p>We think the way of integrating new components to Streamlit is very smart: just assume that you can send all the data you need to build the component as long as this data can be JSON serialized. Additionally, our template will declare our component in a developing stage, so that it is easier for us to adjust our frontend with hot reloading as we make changes. You can go to the <a href="https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/streamlit_components.html">official Streamlit documentation</a> for more details.</p><p>To declare the bidings of our component, we create our component function called <code>terran_timeline</code> like this:</p><pre><pre><code>def terran_timeline(timeline, key=None):
    component_value = _component_func(timeline=timeline, key=key, default=0)

    return component_value
</code></pre></pre><p>...where the <code>_component_func</code> is the one that declares our Streamlit Component and we are saying that we want to send a data structured by the name of <code>timeline</code> to this component. The additional <code>key</code> argument makes it possible to have multiple components of the same kind by specifying different keys, and the <code>default</code> argument stands for the default return value of the component, which in this case means starting second value for the video.</p><a id="create_a_custom_and_interactive_visualization_tool_using_react_and_d3" href="#create_a_custom_and_interactive_visualization_tool_using_react_and_d3"><h2>Create a custom and interactive visualization tool using React and D3</h2></a><p>Then we have to move into the React world and start building our component. The good news is that we can retrieve the <code>timeline</code> object inside our component super easily!</p><pre><pre><code>public render = (): ReactNode =&gt; {
    const timeline = this.props.args["timeline"]
    ...
}
</code></pre></pre><p>Also, we can make our component "return" a value using the <code>Streamlit.setComponentValue</code> function they provide in the template, for example, making that when the user clicks on the timeline widget</p><pre><pre><code>//
// If the user clicks on the timeline, we set the component value to the
// time in seconds where the user clicked
//
Streamlit.setComponentValue(seekTimeSecond);
</code></pre></pre><p>The rest is mostly plain React and D3 stuff we think it's not worth focusing on this blog, but if you are interested you can check how it was implemented in our <a href="https://github.com/pento-group/streamlit-terran-timeline">streamlit-terran-timeline repo</a>.</p><p>Here's an example of what it looks like to use this new Streamlit Component:</p><pre><pre><code>import streamlit as st
from streamlit_terran_timeline import generate_timeline, terran_timeline

# Generate the timeline information
video_url = "https://youtu.be/mbdOqxdiSZc"
timeline = generate_timeline(video_url)

#
# Display the timeline. If the users click, you'll get the exact second of
# the part of the timeline video. By default, it returns 0.
#
start_time = terran_timeline(timeline)

#
# Display the video. Optionally, the user might click the timeline and start the video
# from a different time
#
st.video(video_url, start_time=start_time)
</code></pre></pre><p>In summary, the Streamlit Components feature is a game-changer. It was never more straightforward for us to create dynamic, reliable, and nice-looking pilot projects or demos from scratch. It's also really amazing that the Streamlit community is building new components and we're really thrilled to contribute with ours! If you are interested, you can see a full list of published and upcoming components <a href="https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/streamlit-components-community-tracker/4634">in this community post</a> .</p><p>This is the first of many upcoming Terran demos, so stay in touch to know what other cool stuff we're building!

August 27, 2020 | https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20200827/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20200827/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <!-- Left content -->
  <p>In an open online <a href="https://www.spinellis.gr/unix?source=bl20200827">edX course on Unix tools</a> I was running over the spring with more than a thousand registered learners, I got <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DelftX+UnixTx+1T2020/discussion/forum/93544458673f7c2519a5746c18f1dcc1c3cd4d49/threads/5e77554aeac4b40832a040e4">asked for ideas on how shell scripts can be useful</a>. This is an intriguing question, because the course focuses mainly on performing one-off tasks in the areas of software development, data engineering, and system administration, rather than automation through shell scripts. In response, I posted <a href="https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20200323">how shell scripting improves my personal productivity</a>. Here's my take on how shell scripts are employed in diverse software development tasks. I plan to post further installments on system administration and data analytics.</p>
<p>To produce the examples listed here, I searched the entire <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> source code tree for files with a <code>.sh</code> (shell script) suffix. In total I found 1305 scripts (by running the Unix <code>find /usr/src/ -name \*.sh | wc -l</code> pipeline). In summary, I found that shell scripts are used for testing, as program wrappers and adaptors, for stand-alone program implementations, as code generators, for build orchestration and automation, for release management, and for crafting development tools. My experience is that other large software systems use shell scripts in similar ways.</p>
<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
<p>Shell scripts are used to automate integration testing, by running the program under specific configurations and scenarios and verifying that the program has the expected behavior. They are also be used for regression testing, by running a program and comparing its output against results of previous runs. The FreeBSD <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/tests">/tests</a> suite contains 261 tests of both kinds. Many other programs have test scripts bundled with their source code; see for example the <em>pkill</em> command <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/bin/pkill/tests">tests directory</a>. As an example of regression testing consider the <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/crypto/openssh/regress">OpenSSH regression tests</a>. In total, another 355 test shell scripts reside in individual programs' <code>tests</code> directories and 227 come bundled with the separate <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/contrib/netbsd-tests">NetBSD test suite</a>.</p>
<h3 id="program-wrappers-and-adaptors">Program wrappers and adaptors</h3>
<p>In some cases, either by design or through evolution, a program can be easily written by having a shell script call another one. Consider the following examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>The program <em>ranlib</em>, which adds a symbol table to an archive (library) file, used to be <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/BSD-4_3/usr/src/usr.bin/ranlib.c">a stand-alone program</a>. It is now implemented as a <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/contrib/binutils/binutils/ranlib.sh">one-line shell script</a>, which calls the <em>ar</em> program to do the actual work.</li>
<li>The <em>lp</em> POSIX 1003.2-compliant print spooler interface is implemented as a <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/usr.sbin/lpr/lp/lp.sh">wrapper</a> around the traditional BSD <em>lpr</em> command.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="program-implementations">Program implementations</h3>
<p>Some programs are easy to construct by gluing together other existing Unix commands in a shell script. Here are some examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/usr.sbin/adduser/adduser.sh">adduser</a> and <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/usr.sbin/adduser/rmuser.sh">rmuser</a> user management commands.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/usr.sbin/manctl/manctl.sh">manctl</a> program, which compresses or decompresses the system's manual pages.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/usr.sbin/service/service.sh">service</a> system service management command (the equivalent of the <em>systemd</em> <em>systemctl</em> command).</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/usr.sbin/ypserv/ypinit.sh">ypinit</a> command, which builds and installs network information service (NIS or yellow pages) databases.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/usr.sbin/freebsd-update/freebsd-update.sh">freebsd-update</a>, which fetches and installs the system's binary updates.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="code-generation">Code generation</h3>
<p>Many scripts are used for creating code from higher level descriptions. Consider the following cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trivially, the <em>flex</em> <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/contrib/flex/mkskel.sh">mkskel</a> script, reads a text file containing the boilerplate of the generated lexical analyzer, and converts it into a C array that can be compiled into the lexical analyzer generator executable program.</li>
<li>The <em>curses</em> library <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/contrib/ncurses/include/MKparametrized.sh">MKparametrized</a> script generates C source for an array specifying whether terminal capability (<em>termcap</em>) strings should undergo parameter and padding translation.</li>
<li>As a more sophisticated case, the kernel's <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0//sys/kern/makesyscalls.sh">makesyscalls</a> shell script, reads <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/sys/kern/syscalls.master">a declarative specification of the supported system calls</a>, and generates the C code that implements the interface to call the lower-level implementation routines.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="build-orchestration-and-automation">Build orchestration and automation</h3>
<p>Although shell commands can be readily specified in most build systems, such as <em>make</em>, complex build actions are better documented and tested by putting them in a separate shell script file. For example, <em>yacc</em> uses such a script to <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/contrib/byacc/test/run_make.sh">orchestrate the build process</a>, while <em>libsodium</em> <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/sys/contrib/libsodium/dist-build/">uses separate shell scripts</a> to initiate the <em>make</em>-based build process on different systems, ranging from iOS to Android. More widely, the <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/share/mk/meta2deps.sh">meta2deps</a> shell script looks for "meta" files and extracts information needed to deduce build and src dependencies, <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/tools/build/depend-cleanup.sh">depend-cleanup</a> cleans dependencies after some difficult-to-track source code changes, and <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/tools/tinder.sh">tinder</a> builds parts of the source code tree on all supported architectures.</p>
<h3 id="release-management">Release management</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/release/scripts">Several scripts</a> are used for putting together the system's release, including the distribution packages, the release notes, the distributed file manifest, and the architecture-specific ISO images.</p>
<h3 id="development-tools">Development tools</h3>
<p>Shell scripts are also used for constructing <em>ad hoc</em> tools for bespoke development tasks. For instance, the <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/tools/tools/kernxref/kernxref.sh">kernxref</a> tool creates a cross reference of a kernel's symbols, while the <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/tools/tools/kernelcruft/kernelcruft.sh">kerncruft</a> tool finds unused kernel source code files.</p>

    <p><img src="https://kleiber.me/img/python-nlp-2020.png" alt="Top 10 Python Libraries for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in 2020"></p>

<p>In February 2018, I wrote an <a href="https://kleiber.me/blog/2018/02/25/top-10-python-nlp-libraries-2018/">article</a> about ten interesting Python libraries for Natural Language Processing (NLP).</p>

<p>Compared to 2018, the NLP landscape has widened further, and the field has gained even more traction. While not a perfect measurement, the large number of available libraries and packages is a good indicator of how much (openly accessible) material is out there. At the time of writing, looking for “NLP” on <a href="https://pypi.org/search/?q=NLP">PyPI</a> leads to more than 1,560 results. Similarly, <a href="https://libraries.io/search?languages=Python&amp;q=NLP">Libraries.io</a> lists 450 Python packages/libraries for the NLP keyword. Therefore, I thought it is time to have a look at some interesting NLP libraries again. Please note, however, that this is not meant as a replacement for the 2018 article but rather as an update and addition. Therefore, if you have not done so yet, please also look at the original list as I made some more general comments about NLP and NLP libraries.</p>

<p>Since I wrote that first article, fortunately, a lot has changed in the field of NLP, and we have seen a lot of interesting progress. Things are moving fast! The biggest change, at least from my perspective, is the much more widespread adoption of neural networks, deep learning, and particularly Transformer-based models (see, for example, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT (late 2018)</a>, <a href="https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf">GPT-2 (2019)</a>, and most recently <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3 (2020)</a>. While ‘traditional’ approaches to NLP and computational linguistics are still going strong, and rightfully so, these new models and methods are moving the field forward and allow us to do new and exciting things. Hence, I tried to reflect this change in the list of Python libraries as well.</p>

<h2 id="top-10-python-libraries">Top 10 Python Libraries</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Disclaimer</em>: In the following I’m going to use the terms ‘library’, ‘module’, and ‘package’ rather loosely. Please don’t give me a hard time about it. For the sake of this article, a library will be defined as a (collection of) (third party) extension(s) that you can use in your own code that provides some additional functionality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I said before, there is a myriad of tools and libraries to choose from. Hence it is extremely hard to come up with a reasonable “Top 10 List”. The list I am presenting here has been compiled following a few, rather loose, criteria: I wanted to showcase actively developed, widely used, and multipurpose libraries that are useful to as many developers and researchers as possible. I also took the number of GitHub stars (as a proxy for spread and popularity) as well as the date of the last commit into account. Ultimately, however, the list is also influenced by my experience and my view of what is useful. I am certain that there will be readers who would have liked to see a very different set of libraries - that’s perfectly fine and reasonable!</p>

<p>Where it makes sense, I have provided short examples for the libraries. These examples, by no means, demonstrate the full capabilities of these tools. They are merely there for you to get a feeling for how the APIs look and feel like 😊.</p>

<p><em>The Top 10 Python NLP Libraries. The ‘+ X since 2018’ notes refer to the number of stars reported in the <a href="https://kleiber.me/blog/2018/02/25/top-10-python-nlp-libraries-2018">2018 article</a>. “GitHub Stars” and “Last Commit” as of 2020-08-26.</em></p>

<p>As you might have noticed, my 2020 list differs significantly from the 2018 one. Compared to the old list, the following libraries have been removed or replaced: <a href="https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/clips/">Pattern</a>, <a href="http://polyglot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Polyglot</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tasdikrahman/vocabulary">Vocabulary</a>, <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyNLPl">PyNLPl</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stanfordnlp/python-stanford-corenlp">Stanford CoreNLP Python</a>, and <a href="http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~hugo/montylingua/">MontyLingua</a>. These libraries have either been replaced by a newly developed one (e.g., <em>Stanza</em> replacing <em>Stanford CoreNLP Python</em>) or are not actively developed or maintained anymore. The exclusion of these libraries does not mean that they are bad or unusable in any way. However, I simply wanted to highlight actively developed projects as well as libraries that represent current developments in the field.</p>

<p>As you can see, the libraries that stayed on the list, measured in the number of GitHub stars, have all gained in popularity. Especially <em>spaCy</em> (first released in 2015), an absolutely fantastic all-purpose library, has gained a lot of traction. Also, again looking at the stars, we can see the huge interest in Transformers (🤗 Transformers having 32.9k stars).</p>

<p>An important side note: Many of these libraries and associated pre-trained models, despite often being multilingual or even language-agnostic, still have a strong focus on (standard) English. Similarly, a large amount of linguistic and NLP research focuses on English and other “major” languages. It is very important for me to point out that “language” should <em>not</em> be equated with (standard) English (or Spanish, or German, or French, …) and that the marginalization of other languages and varieties is a severe problem. Therefore, I want to point out that there are various research projects (see, for example, <a href="https://www.masakhane.io/">Masakhane</a> for African languages) devoted to other languages that deserve both attention and support.</p>

<h2 id="libraries-in-detail">Libraries in Detail</h2>

<p>This article will only focus on those libraries that I have newly added to the list. For details and examples regarding the other libraries, please just have a look at the <a href="https://kleiber.me/blog/2020/08/26/top-10-python-nlp-libraries-2020/(https://kleiber.me/blog/2018/02/25/top-10-python-nlp-libraries-2018)">previous article</a>.</p>

<h3 id="-transformers">🤗 Transformers</h3>

<p><a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face</a>, hence the 🤗, has released a number of highly interesting NLP libraries, utilities, and datasets/models. The most widely known one being 🤗 <em>Transformers</em>, providing easy access to many pre-trained models as well as great interfaces to <em>PyTorch</em> and <em>TensorFlow</em>. Contrary to many of the other libraries, 🤗 <em>Transformers</em> is not a “toolkit,” but a very useful and powerful way of working with various language models and embeddings that is particularly optimized for NLU and NLG tasks.</p>

<p>For this brief example, we will be using the <code>pipeline()</code> function to run pre-trained models for various common tasks. Essentially <code>pipeline()</code> automatically retrieves (downloads) the desired model and also handles the preprocessing (especially tokenization) for us. If you are interested in what happens under the hood, definitely look at the <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/quicktour.html#under-the-hood-pretrained-models">documentation</a> that nicely outlines all of the steps taken.</p>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>'''
"This model works really very well." got 5 stars and a score of 0.7683704495429993.
"This model is okay." got 3 stars and a score of 0.812630832195282.
"This model really does not work very well!" got 1 star and a score of 0.49196574091911316.
'''</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In the above example, the <a href="https://huggingface.co/nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment">bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment</a> model is used to predict the sentiment of three statements (reviews). This particular model has been finetuned for sentiment analysis on product reviews and returns a score of stars between one and five. As we can see, for the three simple examples, it performed really well and produced the desired results.</p>

<p>While this example demonstrated how easy it is to get started with 🤗 <em>Transformers</em>, the library’s true value lies in its capabilities when it comes to (re)training/finetuning and customizing models for specific use-cases using either <em>PyTorch</em> or <em>TensorFlow</em>. Also, definitely have a look at the large <a href="https://huggingface.co/models">set of available models for various languages and tasks</a> provided by Hugging Face.</p>

<h3 id="flair">flair</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/flairNLP/flair"><em>flair</em></a>, developed at the Humbold University of Berlin in collaboration with Zalando Research, provides very easy access to powerful state-of-the-art NLP embeddings and models. While <em>flair</em> is built specifically with the powerful “Flair embeddings” (see “<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C18-1139">Contextual String Embeddings for Sequence Labeling</a> for more details) in mind, the library also supports embeddings such as BERT, ELMo, and GloVe.</p>

<p>It comes with a number of embeddings and pre-trained models for various languages and tasks including, for example, Named Entity Recognition, Part-of-Speech Tagging, and Semantic Frame Detection. For each tagging task, <em>flair</em> can use a different model, allowing you to customize your pipeline very well. As we will see below, the library also supports stacking embeddings, which is an exciting …</p></div></div>

    <div>
                <p><a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> is a widely used language for data science, but due to performance most of its underlying library are written in C, C++, or Fortran. <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> is a relative newcomer to the field which has busted out since its 1.0 to become <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/static/interactive-the-top-programming-languages-2020">one of the top 20 most used languages</a> due to its high performance libraries for scientific computing and machine learning. Julia's value proposition has been its high performance in high level language, known as solving the two language problem, which has allowed allowed the language to build <a href="https://juliahub.com/ui/Home">a robust, mature, and expansive package ecosystem</a>. While this has been a major strength for package developers, the fact remains that there are still large and robust communities in other high level languages like R and Python. Instead of spawning distracting language wars, we should ask the question: can Julia become a language of libraries to accelerate these other languages as well?</p>
<p>This is definitely not the first time this question was asked. The statistics libraries in Julia were developed by individuals like <a href="http://128.105.7.173/~bates/">Douglas Bates who built some of R's most widely used packages like lme4 and Matrix</a>. Doug had <a href="https://rpubs.com/dmbates/377897">written a blog post in 2018 showing how to get top notch performance in linear mixed effects model fitting via JuliaCall</a>. In 2018 the JuliaDiffEq organization had <a href="https://sciml.ai/news/2018/04/30/Jupyter/"> written a blog post demonstrating the use of DifferentialEquations.jl in R and Python (the Jupyter of Diffrential Equations)</a>. Now rebranded as <a href="https://sciml.ai/">SciML</a> for <a href="https://sciml.ai/roadmap/">Scientific Machine Learning</a>, we looked to expand our mission and bring <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04385">automated model discovery and acceleration</a> include other languages like R and Python with Julia as the base.</p>
<p>With the release of <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/diffeqr/index.html">diffeqr</a> v1.0, we can now demonstrate many advances in R through the connection to Julia. Specifically, I would like to use this blog post to showcase:</p>
<ol>
<li>The new direct wrapping interface of diffeqr</li>
<li>JIT compilation and symbolic analysis of ODEs and SDEs in R using Julia and <a href="https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl">ModelingToolkit.jl</a></li>
<li>GPU-accelerated simulations of ensembles using Julia's <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqGPU.jl">DiffEqGPU.jl</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Together we will demonstrate how models in R can be accelerated by 1000x without a user ever having to write anything but R.</p>
<h2>A Quick Note Before Continuing</h2>
<p>Before continuing on with showing all of the features, I wanted to ask for support so that we can continue developing these bridged libraries. Specifically, I would like to be able to support developers interested in providing a fully automated Julia installation and static compilation so that calling into Julia libraries is just as easy as any Rcpp library. To show support, the easiest thing to do is to star our libraries. The work of this blog post is build on <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl">DifferentialEquations.jl</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SciML/diffeqr">diffeqr</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl">ModelingToolkit.jl</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqGPU.jl">DiffEqGPU.jl</a>. Thank you for your patience and now back to our regularly scheduled program.</p>
<h2>diffeqr v1.0: Direct wrappers for Differential Equation Solving in R</h2>
<p>First let me start with the new direct wrappers of differential equations solvers in R. In the previous iterations of diffeqr, we had relied on specifically designed high level functions, like "ode_solve", to compensate for the fact that one could not directly use Julia's original DifferentialEquations.jl interface directly from R. However, the new diffeqr v1.0 directly exposes the entirety of the Julia library in an easy to use framework.</p>
<p>To demonstrate this, let's see how to define the Lorenz ODE with diffeqr. In Julia's DifferentialEquations.jl, we would start by defining an "ODEProblem" that contains the initial condition u0, the time span, the parameters, and the f in terms of `u' = f(u,p,t)` that defines the derivative. In Julia, this would look like:</p>

<p>With the new diffeqr, diffeq_setup() is a function that does a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It instantiates a Julia process to utilize as its underlying compute engine</li>
<li>It first checks if the correct Julia libraries are installed and, if not, it installs them for you</li>
<li>Then it exposes all of the functions of DifferentialEquations.jl into its object</li>
</ol>
<p>What this means is that the following is the complete diffeqr v1.0 code for solving the Lorenz equation is:</p>


<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre>library(diffeqr)
de &lt;- diffeqr::diffeq_setup()
f &lt;- function(u,p,t) {
  du1 = p[1]*(u[2]-u[1])
  du2 = u[1]*(p[2]-u[3]) - u[2]
  du3 = u[1]*u[2] - p[3]*u[3]
  return(c(du1,du2,du3))
}
u0 &lt;- c(1.0,1.0,1.0)
tspan &lt;- c(0.0,100.0)
p &lt;- c(10.0,28.0,8/3)
prob &lt;- de$ODEProblem(f, u0, tspan, p)
sol &lt;- de$solve(prob,saveat=1.0)</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>


<p>This then carries on through SDEs, DDEs, DAEs, and more. Through this direct exposing form, the whole library of DifferentialEquations.jl is at the finger tips of any R user, making it a truly cross-language platform.</p>
<p>(Note that the only caveat is that diffeq_setup requires that the user has already installed Julia and julia is included in the path. We hope that future developments can eliminate this need.)</p>
<h2>JIT compilation and symbolic analysis of ODEs and SDEs in R via ModelingToolkit.jl</h2>
<p>The reason for Julia is speed (well and other things, but here, SPEED!). Using the pure Julia library, we can solve the Lorenz equation 100 times in about 0.05 seconds:</p>


<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre>@<span>time</span> <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>1</span>:<span>100</span> solve<span>(</span>prob,saveat=<span>1.0</span><span>)</span> <span>end</span>
<span>0.048237</span> seconds <span>(</span><span>156.80</span> k allocations: <span>6.842</span> MiB<span>)</span>
<span>0.048231</span> seconds <span>(</span><span>156.80</span> k allocations: <span>6.842</span> MiB<span>)</span>
<span>0.048659</span> seconds <span>(</span><span>156.80</span> k allocations: <span>6.842</span> MiB<span>)</span></pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>


<p>Using diffeqr connected version, we get:</p>


<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre>lorenz_solve &lt;- function (i){
  de$solve(prob,saveat=1.0)
}
&nbsp;
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   6.81    0.02    6.83
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   7.09    0.00    7.10
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   6.78    0.00    6.79</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>


<p>That's not good, that's about 100x difference! In <a href="https://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/why-numba-and-cython-are-not-substitutes-for-julia/">this blog post I described that interpreter overhead and context switching</a> are the main causes of this issue. We've also demonstrated that <a href="https://gist.github.com/ChrisRackauckas/cc6ac746e2dfd285c28e0584a2bfd320">ML accelerators like</a> <a href="https://gist.github.com/ChrisRackauckas/6a03e7b151c86b32d74b41af54d495c6">PyTorch</a> generally do not perform well in this regime since those kinds of accelerators rely on heavy array operations, unlike the scalarized nonlinear interactions seen in a lot of differential equation modeling. For this reason we cannot just slap any old JIT compiler onto the f call and then put it into the function since there would still be left over. So we need to do something a bit tricky.</p>
<p>In my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkXNZZ3hSw">JuliaCon 2020 talk, Automated Optimization and Parallelism in DifferentialEquations.jl</a> I demonstrated how <a href="https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl">ModelingToolkit.jl</a> can be used to trace functions and generate <a href="https://mtk.sciml.ai/dev/tutorials/auto_parallel/">highly optimized sparse and parallel code</a> for scientific computing all in an automated fashion. It turns out that JuliaCall can do a form of tracing on R functions, something that exploited to allow <a href="https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/autodiffr">autodiffr to automatically differentiate R code with Julia's AD libraries</a>. Thus it turns out that the same <a href="https://github.com/SciML/AutoOptimize.jl">modelingtoolkitization methods used in AutoOptimize.jl</a> can be used on a subset of R codes which includes a large majority of differential equation models.</p>
<p>In short, we can perform automated acceleration of R code by turning it into sparse parallel Julia code. This was exposed in diffeqr v1.0 as the `jitoptimize_ode(de,prob)` function (also `jitoptimize_sde(de,prob)`). Let's try it out on this example. All you need to do is give it the ODEProblem which you wish to accelerate. Let's take the last problem and turn it into a pure Julia defined problem and then time it:</p>


<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre>fastprob &lt;- diffeqr::jitoptimize_ode(de,prob)
fast_lorenz_solve &lt;- function (i){
  de$solve(fastprob,saveat=1.0)
}
&nbsp;
system.time({ lapply(1:100,fast_lorenz_solve) })
&nbsp;
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,fast_lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   0.05    0.00    0.04
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,fast_lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   0.07    0.00    0.06
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,fast_lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   0.07    0.00    0.06</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>


<p>And there you go, an R user can get the full benefits of Julia's optimizing JIT compiler without having to write lick of Julia code! This function also did a few other things, like automatically defined the <a href="https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/tutorials/advanced_ode_example/#Automatic-Sparsity-Detection">Jacobian code to make implicit solving of stiff ODEs much faster as well</a>, and it can perform sparsity detection and automatically optimize computations on that.</p>
<p>To see how much of an advance this is, note that this Lorenz equation is the same from the <a href="http://desolve.r-forge.r-project.org/">deSolve examples page</a>. So let's take their example and see how well it performs:</p>


<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre>library(deSolve)
Lorenz &lt;- function(t, state, parameters) {
  with(as.list(c(state, parameters)), {
    dX &lt;-  a * X + Y * Z
    dY &lt;-  b * (Y - Z)
    dZ &lt;- -X * Y + c * Y - Z
    list(c(dX, dY, dZ))
  })
}
&nbsp;
parameters &lt;- c(a = -8/3, b = -10, c = 28)
state      &lt;- c(X = 1, Y = 1, Z = 1)
times      &lt;- seq(0, 100, by = 1.0)
out &lt;- ode(y = state, times = times, func = Lorenz, parms = parameters)
&nbsp;
desolve_lorenz_solve &lt;- function (i){
  state      &lt;- c(X = runif(1), Y = runif(1), Z = runif(1))
  parameters &lt;- c(a = -8/3 * runif(1), b = -10 * runif(1), c = 28 * runif(1))
  out &lt;- ode(y = state, times = times, func = Lorenz, parms = parameters)
}
&nbsp;
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,desolve_lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   5.03    0.03    5.07
&gt;
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,desolve_lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   5.42    0.00    5.44
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,desolve_lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   5.41    0.00    5.41</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>


<p>Thus we see 100x acceleration over the leading R library without users having to write anything but R code. This is the true promise in action of a "language of libraries" helping to extend all other high level languages!</p>
<h2>GPU-acceleration of ODEs in R via DiffEqGPU.jl</h2>
<p>Can we go deeper? Yes we can. In many cases like in <a href="https://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/how-inexact-models-can-guide-decision-making-in-quantitative-systems-pharmacology/">optimization and sensitivity analysis of models for pharmacology</a> the users need to solve the same …</p></div></div></div>

		<div>
			




<p><em>Written on May 5, 2019</em></p>







<p><em>In which I muse about the consequences of how we are forced to lie when we use the internet and our gadgets.</em></p>











<p>Perhaps the ancient tribes of Judea predicted Facebook. They wrote</p>



<blockquote><p>You shall not spread a false report.</p><cite>EXODUS 23:1, first published in approx. 1446 BCE by Ancient Scholars. All rights reserved.<br></cite></blockquote>



<p>But before you read on, please confirm the following:</p>



<p> I have read and agree to your terms for reading this article.</p>



<p>Warning: if you happen to be in Burkina Faso, and you found this article using a Yahoo search through Safari, then I am afraid the people in Apple’s legal department want to talk to you. You have just violated section 16 of the agreement that you read and agreed to. (Article 16 only allows you to use Yahoo search in Argentina, Aruba, Australia, Austria, Barbados, Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Cayman Islands, Chile, China mainland, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Colombia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Grenada, Guatemala, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, The Bahamas, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, UK, Uruguay, US and Venezuela.)</p>



<p>Wait, Apple’s lawyers don’t want to talk to you:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>6. Termination.&nbsp;</strong>This License is effective until terminated. Your rights under this License will terminate automatically or otherwise cease to be effective without notice from Apple if you fail to comply with any term(s) of this License. Upon the termination of this License, you shall cease all use of the iOS Software. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12 and 13 of this License shall survive any such termination.</p></blockquote>



<p>Apparently, even if in a moment of weakness you agree to the terms, but then change your mind, you are still bound by sections 4 through 9 and sections 12 and 13 of the agreement. How can this make any kind of sense? By the way, most of these survival clauses are just silly. For example, notice that section 6 (Termination) remains in effect after termination. I am unable to understand what this can possibly mean. The other early clauses concern consent from you to Apple to use certain information that you have provided through use of the software. Well, even if you change your mind about this agreement, you cannot ask Apple to erase any information they (legally) gathered before you terminated the agreement. </p>



<p>Let me be clear, though, this is not to bash Apple. Their agreement is probably no different from many other agreements you have “read and agreed to”. Adobe, for example, have many agreements, and, while they are shorter and better written than the Apple ones, they have their own share of strangeness. For example, Photoshop users have agreed, section 6 paragraph c, not to:</p>



<blockquote><p>(c) use the Software to construct any kind of database;</p></blockquote>



<p>I really have no idea at all what this means. And yet I have to agree to it. Surely my collection of photographs, the very reason I use Photoshop in the first place is <em>some kind</em> of database?</p>



<p>My randomized research project (that is, travelling on the Canada Line train) reveals to me clearly that the vast majority of people who use iPhones and similar gadgets are way (and I mean a long way) younger than you and me. Let’s pick 14 year old Charles over there, happily doing something on his iPhone XS. Apparently, he read, comprehended, and agreed that:</p>



<blockquote><p>The iOS Software contains functionality that allows it to accept digital certificates either issued from Apple or from third parties. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO RELY ON A CERTIFICATE WHETHER ISSUED BY APPLE OR A THIRD PARTY.</p></blockquote>



<p>Or how about this:</p>



<blockquote><p>(a) The iOS Software is licensed under the MPEG-4 Systems Patent Portfolio License for encoding in compliance with the MPEG-4 Systems Standard, except that an additional license and payment of royalties are necessary for encoding in connection with (i) data stored or replicated in physical media which is paid for on a title by title basis and/or (ii) data which is paid for on a title by title basis and is transmitted to an end user for permanent storage and/or use. Such additional license may be obtained from MPEG LA, LLC. See http://www.mpegla.com for additional details.</p></blockquote>



<p>What? Charles, we need to talk. Because I don’t understand these two sections that I read and agreed to. Perhaps you can explain them to me.</p>



<p>On your behalf, dear reader, I decided to visit “mpegla.com”. This was not helpful. For one thing, my brain has become accustomed to shutting down every time I see the phrase “The world’s leading whatever” and MPEG LA, it turns out, claim to be the world’s leading “packager and provider of one stop licenses for standards and other technology platforms.”</p>



<p>Actually, I don’t think it was hard for them to make this claim, because as far as I and Professor Google can tell, they are the <strong>only</strong> such “packager and provider”. </p>



<p>Lets talk about Cookies. Due to legislation in Europe, by well meaning officials, web sites that offer content in Europe are required to obtain a users consent before storing cookies on your computer. It turns out that this bit of legislation is universally mostly ignored. If an organization wanted to be fully compliant, then the first time you visited them, you would have to land on a cookie-free page that asked your consent before you could proceed to their actual content. No one does this. Instead, there are various compromises. I like this one, placed on the bottom of the page:</p>



<blockquote><p>This website uses cookies in order to improve user experience. If you close this box or continue browsing, we will assume you agree with this. For more information about the cookies we use or to find out how you can disable cookies, click here.</p></blockquote>



<p>This is in actual violation of the law, because that web site stores a cookie whether or not you close the box. It is in violation because of Section 5, paragraph 3 of the relevant EU directive which says:</p>



<blockquote><p>3. Member States shall ensure that the use of electronic communications networks to store information or to gain access to information stored in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned is provided with clear and comprehensive information in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC, inter alia about the purposes of the processing, and is offered the right to refuse such processing by the data controller. </p></blockquote>



<p>Much worse, of course, are the sites that ask you the “I have read and accept” intrusion.</p>



<p>There is no doubt that the EU directive has not been pleasant, either for organizations with web sites, or the consumers of these sites. And, of course, not only are we reading things we <em>know</em> to be lies (<em>“This website uses cookies to improve user experience”</em>), but we are often forced to lie in order to read the web page.</p>



<p>So-called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">Surveillance Capitalism</a>” is forcing you, your friends, and your children to lie. Often. Perhaps we should call it Wink-Wink Capitalism. We are all complicit, know what I mean, nudge-nudge, wink-wink?</p>



<p>Now I think there are technical ways to improve cookie treatment, but I will leave that to a possible future article. What worries me mostly are the long-term psychological consequences of what has become routine lying. Of course, this kind of lying is not restricted to web pages. Do you believe this:</p>



<blockquote><p>Please listen carefully, as our menu options have changed</p></blockquote>



<p>Really? When?</p>



<p>Or this:</p>



<blockquote><p>Due to higher than expected call volumes, there may be a longer than usual delay</p></blockquote>



<p>How about this recent press release:</p>



<blockquote><p>Today Hootsuite communicated organizational changes in order to drive greater alignment with our growing company’s strategic priorities that best serve our customers. Unfortunately, this included some reductions to our staff.</p></blockquote>



<p>Perhaps this gives new meaning to the phrase “half-truth” – the part about “reductions”, also known as termination of employment, is true.</p>



<p>Most of us grew up with the belief that telling the truth was important. We were allowed some exceptions, called “white lies”, mostly if it seemed necessary to avoid inflicting unnecessary hurt.</p>



<p>Sadly, the internet has habituated us to lying. If you are someone who has actually read the terms and conditions of every piece of software before you checked the box, then… I don’t believe you. It just is not reasonable to expect you to do this. </p>



<p>The question that I leave you with is simply this. Can we do better?</p>

August 27, 2020 | https://www.osohq.com/post/building-the-github-authorization-model-using-oso | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.osohq.com/post/building-the-github-authorization-model-using-oso">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>When the oso team first started tackling problems in the authorization space, we looked to GitHub permissions as a canonical example of the not-so-simple authorization patterns that can quickly become overwhelming to maintain in application code.</p><p>GitHub provides a pure example of what motivates authorization in the first place—securing access to resources. In GitHub, the resources are repositories<strong>,</strong> and users may or may not be able to take certain actions on them. Repositories may be created, destroyed, read, or edited in any number of ways, and have child resources (issues, wikis, branches, etc.) whose access control is related to that of their parent resource. And permissions hierarchies are not limited to resources. Users can be grouped into organizations, and further grouped into teams and sub-teams, which complicates the business of controlling access even more.</p><p>In this post, we'll show how to incrementally build complex policies with oso. We'll use GitHub's authorization model as an example, but the patterns we cover, including ownership, hierarchical permissions, and nested resources, are common to many user-facing applications.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> this post will focus on oso policies and authorization logic<em>, </em>and won't go into detail on how use the oso library. For more information on this, see our <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/getting-started/application/index.html" target="_blank">guide</a> on adding oso to your application. As of this writing, oso's <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/libraries/index.html" target="_blank">open-source libraries</a> are available in Python, Ruby, Java and Node.js.</p><h4>A note on GitHub permissions</h4><p>Permissions in GitHub revolve around managing access to repositories. If you're unfamiliar with GitHub permissions, you can find a nice overview <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/access-permissions-on-github" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h3>Basic access: owners and collaborators</h3><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1483105c9a72fd0a3b662a/5f4677cc06628a2d540eb123_Untitled.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Let's start with GitHub's simplest authorization use case: user accounts and repositories. If I sign into my personal GitHub account and create a repository, I am the <strong>owner</strong> of that repository. To understand what this means, let's look at the permissions available for user-owned repositories:</p><ul role="list"><li>Admin</li><li>Write</li><li>Read</li></ul><p>These three permission levels determine every action someone can take on a user-owned repository. As the owner, I get {% c-line %}"ADMIN"{% c-line-end %} privileges, which means I can do <em>whatever I want</em> to my repository. {% c-line %}"WRITE"{% c-line-end %} goes to <strong>collaborators,</strong> which we'll talk about in a minute. And if the repository is public, the rest of the world gets to {% c-line %}"READ"{% c-line-end %} it, whether or not they are even logged in. </p><p>Let's look at what these rules might look like in an <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/getting-started/policies/index.html" target="_blank">oso policy</a>. The policy below, like all oso policies, is written in a declarative policy language called Polar.</p><div><p>{% c-block language="polar" %}<br># Owners can take any action on their own repositories.<br>allow(actor: User, _action, resource: Repository) if<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;permission(actor, "ADMIN", resource);</p><p># Organization owners are admins of all organization repositories.<br># Repository owners are admins of their own repositories. <br>permission(actor: User, "ADMIN", resource: Repository) if	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;role(actor, "OWNER", resource);</p><p># Rule specifying repository ownership, <br># based on data stored on application objects.<br>role(actor: User, "OWNER", resource: Repository) if<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resource.owner matches User{id: actor.id};</p><p># Anyone can read a public repository.<br>permission(_actor, "READ", resource: Repository) if<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not resource.isPrivate;<br>{% c-block-end %}</p></div><p>We've created a couple different kinds of rules here. The standard oso <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/more/glossary.html#allow-rules" target="_blank">allow</a> rule is the starting point for evaluating any authorization request. </p><p>We can name our other rules whatever we want, and we've defined them to match GitHub's terminology. We're using {% c-line %}role{% c-line-end %} rules to specify the <strong>role</strong> of a user with respect to a particular resource (i.e., owner of a Repository), and permission to specify a user's permission level (i.e. read). We'll use these supplementary rules when we add more <strong>allow</strong> rules to the policy later on.</p><p>One other thing to note about these rules: the {% c-line %}User{% c-line-end %} and {% c-line %}Repository{% c-line-end %} types specified for actors and resources refer to the object types actually used in the GitHub application code. </p><p>oso makes it possible to pass <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/getting-started/policies/application-types.html" target="_blank">application objects</a> directly into the policy evaluation engine.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, there's another type of user that can access repositories owned by user accounts—collaborators. Repository owners can invite collaborators to a repository. We can access a repository's collaborators with the {% c-line %}.collaborators{% c-line-end %} field; each collaborator has an {% c-line %}id{% c-line-end %} field and a {% c-line %}permission{% c-line-end %} field, which we can use in our policy:</p><p>{% c-block language="polar" %}<br># Look up an actor's permission level from the repository's collaborator list.<br>permission(actor: User, role, resource: Repository) if	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collab in resource.collaborators and	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;actor.id = collab.id and	<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;role = collab.permission;<br>{% c-block-end %}</p><h4>A quirk about GitHub permissions</h4><p>As we've seen, the permissions on user-account-owned repositories are pretty basic and coarse. The next level of complexity in the GitHub authorization model is Organizations. As you might already know, GitHub repositories can also be owned by <strong>organization accounts.</strong> And it turns out that the permissions work quite differently with organizations than with user accounts. But let's see if we can use oso to add organizations with as few changes as possible.</p><h3>Organizations</h3><figure id="w-node-7ccfaf29303c-8e3b6817"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1483105c9a72fd0a3b662a/5f467d32ecc6f33537857cf3_Screen_Shot_2020-08-26_at_11.16.43_AM.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>GitHub organizations have three user types:</p><ul role="list"><li>Owners</li><li>Billing managers</li><li>Members</li></ul><p>We're going to focus on owners and members. Like repository owners, organization owners can take any action on the organization.</p><div><p>{% c-block language="polar" %}<br>allow(actor: User, _action, resource: Organization) if	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;role(actor, "OWNER", resource);</p><p># Rule specifying organization ownership.<br># Note that using the `Organization` specializer prevents it <br># from conflicting with our rule for repository ownership. <br>role(actor: User, "OWNER", resource: Organization) if	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member in resource.membersWithRole and	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member.role = "ADMIN" and	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member.id = actor.id;</p><p>role(actor: User, "MEMBER", resource: Organization) if	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member in resource.membersWithRole and	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member.id = actor.id;<br>{% c-block-end %}</p></div><p>Notice that the logic for defining organization owners is different from the logic for defining repository owners. Organizations do not have an {% c-line %}owner{% c-line-end %} field (there can be multiple owners). Instead, organizations store owners in the {% c-line %}.membersWithRole{% c-line-end %} field, along with every other organization member. GitHub distinguishes owners from other members by giving them a role called {% c-line %}"ADMIN"{% c-line-end %} (not to be confused with the {% c-line %}"ADMIN"{% c-line-end %} permission level for repositories). Normal members simply have the {% c-line %}"MEMBER"{% c-line-end %} role.</p><p>If you didn't get all that, not to worry. All you really need to know is that this logic reflects our best approximation of how the data would actually be stored in GitHub's application, which is why it looks a little strange.</p><p>We can now use the role rules we've written to specify permissions for repositories within organizations. Org members can have any of the following permission levels for a repository in an organization:</p><ul role="list"><li>Read</li><li>Triage</li><li>Write</li><li>Maintain</li><li>Admin</li></ul><p>Organization owners always have {% c-line %}"ADMIN"{% c-line-end %} permissions, for all repositories. This means that we now have two conditions that always give users {% c-line %}"ADMIN"{% c-line-end %} permissions on repositories: 1) if the user owns the repository, and 2) if the user owns the organization that owns the repository. The second condition can be enforced by adding one line to the existing rule for the {% c-line %}"ADMIN"{% c-line-end %} permission:</p><p>{% c-block language="polar" %}<br># Repository owners are admins of their own repositories. <br># Organization owners are admins of all organization repositories.<br>permission(actor: User, "ADMIN", resource: Repository) if<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;role(actor, "OWNER", resource) or<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;role(actor, "OWNER", resource.owner);<br>{% c-block-end %}<br></p><p>Owner permissions? Check. Let's move on to repository permissions for plain old members. GitHub offers two ways for members to gain repository access: <strong>base permissions</strong> and <strong>direct access</strong>. The base permission is the default repository permission given to all organization members:</p><p>{% c-block language="polar" %}<br># All organization members have access to repositories from the base role.<br>permission(actor: User, permission, resource: Repository) if<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;org = resource.owner and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;org matches Organization { baseRole: permission } and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;role(actor, "MEMBER", org);<br>{% c-block-end %}<br></p><p>Direct access refers to permissions given directly to members by admins of the repository. Members with direct access can be found in the repository's list of <strong>collaborators. </strong>Yes, collaborators! Remember those from earlier? The rule we already wrote for collaborator permissions will work for organization-owned repositories as well.</p><h3>Teams</h3><figure id="w-node-ffc27d927b9d-8e3b6817"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1483105c9a72fd0a3b662a/5f467a2acf0c4d0967b0a6ff_Untitled.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>As a quick recap, our policy now depends on three permission sources for repository access: ownership, organization base permissions, and direct access (or collaboration). <em>And each new permission source required minimal, if any modifications to our existing rules.</em> This is one benefit of declarative policies and additive rules. But we're not done yet—let's go over one more permission source for GitHub repositories: Teams.</p><p>Teams group members within organizations. Importantly for us, repository permissions can be assigned to teams in the same way that they can be assigned to individual members. Teams can have sub-teams, which <em>inherit</em> repository permissions from their parent teams. Recursive rules are useful for representing permission inheritance.</p><div><p>{% c-block language="polar" %}<br># We can write a permission rule for Teams.<br>permission(team: Team, perm, resource: Repository) if<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;team in resource.owner.teams and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perm = team.permission;</p><p># subteams inherit repo permissions from their parent team, if they have one.<br>permission(team: Team, perm, …</p></div></div></div></div>

August 27, 2020 | https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/reference-types-in-wasmtime | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/reference-types-in-wasmtime">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A few week ago, I finished implementing support for <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-types/blob/master/proposals/reference-types/Overview.md">the WebAssembly reference
types proposal</a> in Wasmtime. <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/">Wasmtime</a> is a standalone,
outside-the-Web WebAssembly runtime, and the reference types proposal is
WebAssembly’s first foray beyond simple integers and floating point numbers,
into the exciting world of garbage-collected references. This article will
explain what the reference types proposal enables, what it leaves for future
proposals, and how it is implemented in Wasmtime.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-reference-types">What are Reference Types?</h2>

<p>Without the reference types proposal, WebAssembly can only manipulate simple
integer and floating point values. It can’t take or return references to the
host’s objects like, for example, a DOM node on a Web page or an open connection
on a server. There are workarounds: for example, you can store the host objects
in a side table and refere to them by index, but this adds an extra indirection
and implementing the side table requires cooperating glue code on the host
side. That glue code, in particular, is annoying because it is outside of the
Wasm sandbox, diluting Wasm’s safety guarantees, and it is host-specific. If you
want to use your Wasm module on the Web, in a Rust host, and in a Python host,
you’ll need three separate glue code implementations. This makes WebAssembly
less attractive as a universal binary format.</p>

<p>With the reference types proposal, you don’t need glue code to interact with
host references. The proposal has three main parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A new <code>externref</code> type, representing an opaque, unforgable reference to a
host object.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An extension to WebAssembly tables, allowing them to hold <code>externref</code>s in
addition to function references.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New instructions for manipulating tables and their entries.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>With these new capabilities, Wasm modules can talk about host references
directly, rather than requiring external glue code running in the host.</p>

<p><code>externref</code>s play nice with WebAssembly’s sandboxing properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>They are <em>opaque</em>: a Wasm module cannot observe an <code>externref</code> value’s bit
pattern. Passing a reference to a host object into a Wasm module doesn’t
reveal any information about the host’s address space and the layout of host
objects within it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are <em>unforgable</em>: a Wasm module can’t create a fake host reference out of
thin air. It can only return either a reference you already gave it or the
null reference. It <em>cannot</em> pretend like the integer value <code>0x1bad2bad</code> is a
valid host reference, return it to you, and trick you into dereferencing this
invalid pointer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>Here’s a Wasm module that exports a <code>hello</code> function which takes, as an
<code>externref</code> parameter, a reference to an open file and writes “Hello, Reference
Types!” to the file. This module imports the <code>write</code> syscall from a hypothetical
future version of <a href="https://wasi.dev/">WASI</a>, the WebAssembly System Interface, that leverages
reference types.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;; hello.wat</span>

<span>(</span><span>module</span>
  <span>;; Import the write syscall from a hypothetical (and</span>
  <span>;; simplified) future version of WASI.</span>
  <span>;;</span>
  <span>;; It takes a host reference to an open file, an address</span>

  <span>;; Define a memory that is one page in size (64KiB).</span>
  <span>(</span><span>memory</span> <span>(</span><span>export</span> <span>"memory"</span><span>)</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>

  <span>;; At offset 0x42 in the memory, define our data string.</span>
  <span>(</span><span>data</span> <span>(</span><span>i32.const</span> <span>0x42</span><span>)</span> <span>"Hello, Reference Types!\n"</span><span>)</span>

  <span>;; Define a function that writes our hello string to a</span>
  <span>;; given open file handle.</span>
  <span>(</span><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>export</span> <span>"hello"</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>param</span> <span>externref</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span><span>call</span> <span>$write</span>
      <span>;; The open file handle we were given.</span>
      <span>(</span><span>local.get</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
      <span>;; The address of our string in memory.</span>
      <span>(</span><span>i32.const</span> <span>0x42</span><span>)</span>
      <span>;; The length of our string in memory.</span>
      <span>(</span><span>i32.const</span> <span>24</span><span>))</span>
    <span>;; Ignore the return code.</span>
    <span>drop</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This Wasm module will run in <em>any</em> WebAssembly environment where WASI is
available.<sup id="back-ref-wasi-available"><a href="#foot-ref-wasi-available">0</a></sup> We don’t need glue code that is
maintaining a side table, mapping host references to indices.</p>

<h3 id="python">Python</h3>

<p>For example, we can run <code>hello.wat</code> from <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-py/">a Python host
environment</a> without any glue code:</p>

<p>Running <code>hello.wat</code> — once again, without module-specific glue code
— is just as easy in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-dotnet/">.NET</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-go">Go</a> host
environments, and is left as an exercise for the reader ;)</p>

<h3 id="on-the-web">On the Web</h3>

<p>Unlike the other host environments we’ve considered, WASI isn’t natively
implemented on the Web. There’s nothing stopping us, however, from polyfilling
WASI APIs with a little bit of JavaScript and a couple DOM methods! This is
still an improvement because there is overall less module-specific glue
code. Once one person has written the polyfills, everyone’s Wasm modules can
reuse them.</p>

<p>There are many different things an “open file” could be modeled by on the
Web. For this demo, we’ll use a DOM node: writing to it will append text
nodes. This works well because we know our module is only writing text data. If
we were working with binary data, we would choose another polyfilling approach,
like in-memory array buffers backing the file data.</p>

<p>Here is the JavaScript code to run our <code>hello.wat</code> module and polyfill our
<code>future-wasi.write</code> function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// The DOM node we will use as an "open file".</span>

<p>You can view a live demo of this code in the iframe below. It should work in
Firefox 79+, or any other browser that supports reference types (at the time of
writing, Chrome has support for an older version of the reference types proposal
behind the <code>--experimental-wasm-anyref</code> flag, and Safari has in-progress support
behind the <code>JSC_useWebAssemblyReferences</code> flag.)</p>



<h2 id="what-comes-after-the-reference-types-proposal">What Comes After the Reference Types Proposal?</h2>

<p>The in-progress <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/proposal-type-imports/blob/master/proposals/type-imports/Overview.md">WebAssembly type imports proposal</a> builds on
reference types to let you distinguish between different kinds of host objects:
database connections and open files would be separate types. Or, on the Web,
Wasm would distinguish JavaScript <code>Promise</code>s from DOM nodes. It also adds
references that point to types defined by other Wasm modules, not just host
objects.</p>

<p>WASI will want to adopt unforgable reference types for file handles, as the
examples above suggest, instead of using integers. It might make sense for WASI
to wait for type imports, however, so it can use separate types for, say, an
open file and a source of entropy. This is a decision for the WASI subgroup of
the WebAssembly Community Group. Either way, when WASI does make this switch, it
will continue to support integer file descriptors, but implemented inside the
Wasm sandbox as indices into an <code>externref</code> Wasm table.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types/blob/master/proposals/interface-types/Explainer.md">interface types</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/module-linking/blob/master/proposals/module-linking/Explainer.md">module linking</a> proposals promise to remove even more
glue code and bindings. The interface …</p></div></div>

Every day from December 1st until the 25th, a new challenge is posted and you’re encouraged to submit a solution.</p> <h2 id="analyzing-the-challenge">Analyzing the Challenge</h2> <p>Let’s take a look at <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/3">AoC’s Day 3 challenge</a>.</p> <p>This problem requires us to count the number of overlapping claims in a given area. That area, which is the fabric in the challenge, can be represented by a 2-dimensional array of zeros in a naive solution to this problem.</p> <p>Every item in the 2-dimensional array will keep a count of how many claims take ownership of that item.</p> <p>Each claim can be thought of as another smaller 2-dimensional array of ones that we add to the larger 2-dimensional array. When we are finished, we can count how many items in the larger 2-dimensional array are greater than 1. Those items will represent the square inches of fabric that belong to more than one claim.</p> <h2 id="pure-python-solution">Pure Python Solution</h2> <p>Here’s a solution written in Python. While in the above analysis I said that we can think of each claim as being a 2-dimensional array of ones that we’ll add to the greater 2-dimensional array, our implementation will differ.</p> <p>We’ll iterate over the Cartesian coordinates of each claim and add <code>1</code> to the corresponding item in the greater 2-dimensional array.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>NamedTuple</span><span>,</span> <span>List</span>

August 27, 2020 | https://rushter.com/blog/gzip-indexing/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rushter.com/blog/gzip-indexing/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This article demonstrates how specially crafted but ordinary gzip archives can be used as a database like storage. It also introduces a <a href="https://github.com/ProfoundNetworks/gzipi">Python package</a> and explains how it works.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip">gzip</a> is a popular file compression format to store large amounts of raw data. It has a good data compression ratio, but relatively slow compression/decompression speed.</p><p>Many companies use it in Big data applications when they need to store compressed CSV or JSON lines files. Such file formats are <strong>row-oriented</strong> and usually processed line by line. gzip can save a lot of space, especially when you have repetitive field names in JSON files.</p><p>Unfortunately, a compressed file can only be accessed in the streaming fashion. Even if you have a sorted file and you know that you don't need the first half of the file — you can't jump to an arbitrary point in a file without starting decompressing it from the start of the file.</p><h2>gzip format</h2><p>A single gzip archive can only contain one file. Any gzip file starts with a magic number (1f 8b) followed by a 10-byte header that contains metadata. After the header, it contains compressed data followed by CRC32 checksum and the size of the original file.</p><p>The most interesting detail about the format is that gzip <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1952">RFC</a> allows multiple compressed files to be concatenated into a single file. Since gzip only allows to compress one file, multiple concatenated archives will still produce one file when decompressing.</p><p>Here is how two concatenated gzip files look like:</p><p><img src="https://rushter.com/static/uploads/img/gzip/multiple.svg" width="150"></p><p>You can think of it as concatenating two txt files. The final file will have content from both files. To combine multiple compressed files, you can use the <code>cat</code> command from GNU tools.</p><div><pre><span></span><code>$ <span>echo</span> <span>'123'</span> <span>|</span> gzip &gt; <span>1</span>.txt.gz
$ <span>echo</span> <span>'456'</span> <span>|</span> gzip &gt; <span>2</span>.txt.gz
$ cat <span>1</span>.txt.gz <span>2</span>.txt.gz &gt; <span>3</span>.txt.gz
$ zcat <span>3</span>.txt.gz
<span>123</span>
<span>456</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>zcat</code> command is an alias to <code>gunzip -c</code>.</p><h2>Semi-random access</h2><p>An ability to concatenate multiple archives is a very handy property. By exploiting this feature and trading a little bit of speed and disk space, we can achieve semi-random access. By random access, I mean the ability to read an arbitrary offset of data from a file without reading the whole file.</p><p>To implement semi-random access, we need to split our uncompressed input into small chunks and compress them separately. We can chunk it by the number of lines. We can also chunk it by the number of bytes rounded to the nearest line end.</p><p>Let's suppose we have 1TB of JSON lines data that contains 10M of HTML webpages from <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">Common Crawl</a> (CC). Since it takes a lot of space, we want to compress our data. When our dataset is compressed, it only takes around 180GB, which is <strong>six times</strong> less than storing uncompressed data. HTML data have a lot of repetitive tags, and they can be compressed pretty efficiently.</p><p>We also want to have random access to be able to sample smaller subsets of data without reading the whole archive. To do so, we can chunk (partition) our input by 10-100 lines and make a gzip archive from each chunk. We can do this on the go and append all the compressed chunks on the go to a single file.</p><p>Since our gzip archive is now chunked, we can jump to a random position in a file and search for the nearest gzip block. As we already know, each gzip file starts with a magic number and a specially defined header, so it's possible to locate each chunk's start.</p><p>To be able to perform line-level random access, we can chunk our input by one line. That is, we can make a separate archive from each line of our input. This gives us better random access but comes with a cost.</p><p>An empty gzip archive takes 20 bytes of space. If your lines are very short, gzipping each line can make a compressed file even bigger than the original input.</p><h2>gzip file as a database</h2><p>If each row in your data has a unique key, you can index it for faster lookups. For example, each row in our Common Crawl data has a domain name as a primary key. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_key">primary key</a> length is relatively short compared to the content of the other fields (HTML and HTTP headers).</p><p>Since we already chunk our data, we can keep the start of the gzipped chunk for each of our primary keys. Primary keys are usually short, and we can store such information in a separate uncompressed txt file. This will be our index.</p><p>Gzipped files contain binary data. Thus, we need to keep the byte offset:</p><div><pre><span></span><code>domain_name|byte_offset_start
</code></pre></div><p>If the number of chunks is large, you can also store the line start (local character offset) inside the gzipped archive. This allows us to jump a particular line quickly. For additional speed gains, we can also keep offset size or offset end.</p><div><pre><span></span><code>domain_name|gzip_byte_offset_start|gzip_byte_offset_end|char_offset_start|char_offset_end
</code></pre></div><p>Every modern file-system supports random access and allows us to read an arbitrary offset of a file. Given a row from our index file, we can first jump to our specific gzip chunk. After locating it, we can decompress it on the go and skip first n characters until we hit the start of the line that we need to retrieve.</p><p>Given the index line, we can retrieve any row in <strong>almost</strong> <strong>constant time</strong>. When using an SSD storage, searching for a single line on 200GB of compressed Common Crawl data takes less than 0.1 seconds.</p><p>The plaintext index for 10 million domains takes around 500MB of disk space, which is nothing compared to the size of HTML data.</p><h2>Binary search</h2><p>Fast lookups sound very interesting, but searching for a specific key in the index file takes time too. For the CC use case, we need an ability to quickly find an arbitrary domain name in our index file.</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a> algorithm can be very handy for this problem. All we need to do is to sort our index file by the key. We don't need to load the index file in memory, because we can use random access to jump to specific lines of the uncompressed file.</p><p>This article is already pretty long, so I won't get into details of how binary search works. It's a very fast algorithm, and it takes around 20 jumps on average to find the domain name in 10M of rows. If you haven't heard about it, you can have a look at a <a href="http://www.cs.armstrong.edu/liang/animation/web/BinarySearch.html">visualization</a>.</p><p>The main idea of the algorithm is to split the available data in half on each iteration and check the key in the middle. Since all data is sorted, we can quickly locate the primary key by knowing which side to keep and split next.</p><p>When everything is combined, the complete search system takes <strong>less than 0.3 seconds</strong> to search in the 1TB of compressed data.</p><p>I came up with this idea with <a href="https://github.com/mpenkov">Michael Penkov</a>, and we use such an approach for real tasks. We also wrote a <a href="https://github.com/ProfoundNetworks/gzipi">Python package</a> called <code>gzipi</code>, and the <a href="https://github.com/ProfoundNetworks/gzipi/blob/master/gzipi/lib.py">whole implementation</a> takes less than 1k of lines when using GNU tools (such as <code>cat</code>, <code>sort</code>, and <code>gzip</code>). The code is easy to learn and understand.</p><h2>How to use gzipi</h2><p>To start using gzipi, you need to have Python and <code>pip</code> installed on your system:</p><p>Please note that you also need GNU tools on your system. It works on Linux and macOS without any problems.</p><p>After installation, you can repack your existing gzip file:</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>$</span> gzipi repack -f websites.json.gz -i index.gzi -o websites_repacked.json.gz --format json --field domain
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>field</code> argument specifies primary key. The input format could be <code>csv</code> or <code>json</code>.</p><p>Now you can search for an arbitrary key:</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>$</span> gzipi search --input-file websites_repacked.json.gz --index-file index.gzi --key google.com
</code></pre></div><h2>S3 support and cost savings</h2><p>One of our requirements was to support S3 as a storage for our compressed files. Fortunately, S3 allows reading arbitrary offsets, so we don't need to store compressed files locally. Since binary search takes most of the time, storing index files locally significantly speeds up the search.</p><p>If you have gzipped JSON lines files, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/athena/">Amazon athena</a> provides a solution to query them using SQL syntaxis. It's a very convenient solution, but Amazon charges $5 per T.B. of data scanned. Using Amazon's solution would potentially cost us <strong>thousands</strong> of dollars per month, and our solution cost us almost nothing because reading data from S3 from the same region is free.</p><h2>Possible improvements</h2><p>There are many ways to improve the search even more. Them main benefit of our solution is that it does not require a third-party database and takes very little RAM.</p><p>Instead of using the binary search algorithm, you can use B-tree or MARISA-trie structures. To use them, you need to store the index file in memory.</p><p>Instead of storing keys (domain names) in a file, you can also use hash tables, but that requires storing intermediate gzip files when compressing the data. When using hash tables, you don't need to store domain names. The only thing that is required is the start of the gzip chunk for each bucket.</p><h2>Afterword</h2><p>It took me a few days to implement an initial solution to our problem, and when I was writing it, we didn't know that there are similar solutions to query billions of webpages. As it turned out later, Common Crawl and Web Archive use pretty similar solutions. Common Crawl uses <a href="https://iipc.github.io/warc-specifications/specifications/warc-format/warc-1.0/">WARC</a> files to store HTTP responses, and each response is stored as a single gzip chunk. It also uses <a href="https://github.com/webrecorder/pywb">pywb</a> library that provides an <a href="https://index.commoncrawl.org/CC-MAIN-2020-34">API</a> and indexing capabilities.</p><p>Such an approach allows Common Crawl to query <strong>2.45 billion web pages</strong> without using a database. Since all CC data is on the S3, it also scales very well. Everyone that has access to S3 can query the data without talking to a centralized server.</p><p>The main difference is that our approach is focused on JSON and CSV files that contain much smaller sets of data (narrow data) on each row. Because of that, I use tens of thousands of rows per each gzip chunk.</p></div></div>]]>

Organizations have also seen their importance grow daily, steered by similar internal and external market forces. Many organizations have found themselves eager to embrace diversity to some degree, yet, many have found it difficult to implement and maintain a diverse workforce. Whether employees have demonstrated a lack of willingness to embrace change or availability of a diverse workforce is perceived to be dim, organizations have faced a multi-faceted challenge as they strive to gain the perceived benefits of ethnically diverse teams such as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rsmdiscovery/2018/08/22/why-workplace-diversity-is-so-important-and-why-its-so-hard-to-achieve/#13f1cb7a3096">higher innovation, greater opportunities with a broader clientele and higher profitability</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many organizations see diversity as an opportunity to bring different ideas, challenges, and solutions to their unique challenges because of the different experiences individuals accumulated throughout their life. Diverse teams are perceived to promote acceptance and, in turn, reduce discrimination. McKinsey &amp; Company – a global consulting firm – has gone a little further in their qualitative and quantitative analysis of the matter in their <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters">Why diversity matters (2015)</a>, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/delivering-through-diversity">Delivering through diversity (2018)</a> and <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured%20Insights/Diversity%20and%20Inclusion/Diversity%20wins%20How%20inclusion%20matters/Diversity-wins-How-inclusion-matters-vF.pdf">Diversity wins: How inclusion matters (2020)</a> reports. One thing became clearer to them, highly diverse organizations have been outperforming their peers on average.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the alleged benefits of having a diverse workforce, several organizations still struggle with attracting and retaining a diverse workforce. Several factors play an important role in this misalignment between goals (or objectives and policies) and actual implementation. These issues need to be addressed to ensure a healthy workplace that considers the needs of the workforce it wants to attract and maintain.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This article will specifically focus on the retention of diverse employees. However, if you would like to read more about how to attract diverse employees, please see the article <a href="https://gpetrium.com/how-to-attract-a-diverse-workforce/"><em>How to Attract a Diverse Workforce</em></a>.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="565740a2" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>How to Maintain a Diverse Workforce</h2></p></div><div data-id="6c5578dd" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To maintain a diverse workforce, first there are a few internal items that organizations need to address. Such practices not only will increase the chances that persons from a diverse background want to apply to an organization, but also will increase the chances that they will continue working on the organization at a later stage.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once enhancements have been done on <a href="https://gpetrium.com/how-to-attract-a-diverse-workforce/"><em>How to Attract a Diverse Workforce</em></a>, the organization needs to look inwards to understand the opportunities and challenges that it is likely to face as it expands diversity within its personnel. This activity may start with a couple of internal research on diversity to fuel strategic thinking and actionable goals as it strives to promote workforce engagement. Additionally, staff should be surveyed as they can provide valuable feedback on the company’s practices, culture and, on how both topics affect and incentive (or disincentive) diversity within the organization. As such, having a realistic picture of the state of diversity should be considered a first step in the journey to attract and maintain a diverse workforce.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="f23b5a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p><b>1) Inclusive Culture:</b> internal company culture plays an expansive role in workforce retention, especially among diverse hires. A culture in which discriminatory practices and ostracization prevail does not entice a friendly environment for individuals from minority groups. As such, it is important to promote diversity not only on paper, but also in practice by instilling policies that punish and disincentivize discriminatory behaviour and promote inclusiveness, so individuals feel safe and cared for. A culture that promotes a friendly tone of inclusivity which celebrates diversity is more conducive of a global workforce composed of different ethnic backgrounds, creeds, genders, and beliefs.<o:p></o:p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/0418/pages/6-steps-for-building-an-inclusive-workplace.aspx">The Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) provided valuable pointers on how to create and promote a culture of inclusiveness</a>. It all starts with training top-level executives on the importance of diversity and forming a dedicated council composed of diverse managers who will focus on implementing a strategy that promotes diversity and inclusion in the organization. Their approach also entails honouring employee’s diverse backgrounds and surveying employees on inclusiveness and diversity. As suggested by SHRM, it goes without saying that proper goal measuring and data gathering efforts should be made. Note that a dedicated council may not be viable to smaller organizations due to limited resource availability, in such cases, it remains possible to gather data on the workforce and to have at least two individuals sharing their thoughts on the available data.<o:p></o:p></p></div></div></div><div data-id="9073bf3" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p><strong>2) Report on and celebrate workforce diversity: </strong>several workplaces report on diversity not only externally (<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/diversity/overview">McKinsey</a>, <a href="https://www.coca-colacompany.com/shared-future/people-values#:~:text=We%20value%20diversity%20and%20inclusion,the%20better%20decisions%20we%20make.">Coca-Cola</a>, and <a href="https://www.accenture.com/ca-en/about/inclusion-diversity-index">Accenture</a>) but also internally. This helps employees feel proud of being part of an organization that cares for diversity and works towards a more equitable environment. Share goals and achievements and survey employees on said items to gauge if they are accurate reflections of the picture, and to understand if they agree with the direction the company is taking – to ensure collective participation and unity towards a common goal. Be mindful that there is a fine balance in reporting and celebrating workforce diversity to not oversaturate the organization’s vision. Keep it realistic to not create falsehoods and cynicism that can exacerbate division.</p></div></div><div data-id="6bbed9c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p><strong>3) Educate your company on diversity topics formally and informally:</strong> certain companies provide annual training to their employees on diversity. Despite controversial data on the effectiveness of diversity training, some advocates <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/07/two-types-of-diversity-training-that-really-work">defend that the practice can be effective when awareness and skill development is at the core of the training</a>. Topics and approaches may include:</p><ul><li>Fact case scenarios to better understand how to deal with a certain situation that may occur when interacting with individuals from different backgrounds and to discuss possible personal biases.</li><li>Perspective-taking exercises, as suggested by <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/07/two-types-of-diversity-training-that-really-work">HBR</a>, whereas individuals are given scenarios and required to respond by taking the perspective of minority groups such as females, LGBT, and racial minorities.</li><li>Research on the benefits of diversity, inclusion, and how the company plans to tie all of that to its culture and future objectives.</li><li>Refresher on policies that surround diversity and inclusion such as Anti-harassment policies, Anti-reprisal policies, Code of Ethics, etc.</li></ul></div></div></div><div data-id="d05aeed" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p><strong>4) Promote transparency in decision-making:</strong> improve transparency in Human Resources decision making when it comes to hiring, promoting, firing, and training individuals. Honest and open communication on decision making can open the doors to create a sense of trust and respect between management and employees. Transparency also has the added bonus of increasing engagement when done appropriately and it trickles to topics beyond decision making. For instance, educating employees on open channels to report on misconduct or provide feedback, discussing challenges openly and appropriately, etc.</p></div></div><div data-id="62159b1" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p><strong>5) Improve the onboarding process:</strong> pay special attention to the onboarding process as they can facilitate employee integration, helping them to feel engaged, included, and welcomed in the company. This process is essential to the success of every new employee, but it can be especially powerful to employees of diverse backgrounds which may often feel left out. A proper welcome and introduction to the resources, infrastructure, and assets available to them will go a long way. Ensure that during this process, employees are also made aware of special groups and communities (i.e. Toastmasters or Women in Leadership) available within the organization that they can join and be a member of. Whenever possible, provide the employee with a mentor or point of contact that can be reached out to for support. It can be a manager, coordinator, cubicle buddies or a more experienced employee with a similar job description. Be sure to let the point of contact know of the onboarding date, the name of the person and expected support that they will need to provide to the new hire.</p></div></div><div data-id="b5b63a4" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p><strong>6) Leverage exit interviews:</strong> understand the power of exit interviews as they are uniquely positioned to gather information of soon to be former employees on what they consider to be company successes, challenges, and failures. Not only that, individuals feel more inclined to provide honest feedback since the perceived risk of losses are lower as they exit the company, and as such, the feedback can be more direct and targeted. It is important to understand that, depending on the circumstances in which the employment has ended, some of the opinions may be biased and may require that one does a bit more research before jumping into conclusions.</p></div></div><div data-id="c74dc9c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p><strong>7) Make actionable goals:</strong> Data gathered while surveying your employees and researching your organization’s demographic is valuable to craft SMART goals and objectives associated with enhancing diversity measures in your organization. Actionable goals ensure that teams can better grasp what’s needed to further advance diversity efforts in the organization. For instance, a broad goal such as “Increase the number of diverse hires” may not be as helpful as “Ensure that 100% of the job adds discuss diversity and secure at least 1 partnerships with universities and 1 partnership with an association whose representation is composed of individuals from a diverse background to advertise job posts”. The quantifiability and granularity of the latter statement allows employees to have clear insight into what needs to be done to accomplish a broader strategic goal associated with diversity.</p></div></div><div data-id="352f6e6" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p><strong>8) Ensure that the organization’s culture, policies, and …</strong></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><em>Note: Modern Treasury empowers teams to make payment operations simple, scalable, and secure. The “Guides” series walks through representative businesses or payment processes and explains step by step how best to go about building them from scratch. ‍</em><br></p><p>‍</p><h4>Introduction</h4><p>Venture capital and private equity funds have become a large industry, with <a href="https://www.firstrepublic.com/-/media/frb/documents/pdfs/innovators/Preqin-and-First-Republic-Update-US-Venture-Capital-in-2019---V2.pdf?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWVRnNU1EZzBOREUzWVdZNSIsInQiOiJyY001aGduS01TZDRQejViQTladFVEK2c0VXY0VHh3MldCc0plK3VIaUhVUkxVeFRNZWd5N3" target="_blank">hundreds</a> of new funds getting started on an annual basis. They range in size from an angel investor investing a million dollars to giant growth and PE funds managing $100 billion or more.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The key to success lies in the investing decisions: attracting deal flow, identifying deals to invest in, winning those deals, and managing the companies to a successful outcome, be it an acquisition or IPO. But in addition to these there are the mechanics of fund operations, from receiving capital calls from Limited Partners (an “LP” is an investor in a fund), wiring funds to portfolio companies, receiving the proceeds from sales of the companies or sales of shares post IPO, and distributing those back to LPs.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For smaller funds, these operations tend to be outsourced to fund custodians, third parties that handle the backoffice of funds and manage incoming and outgoing wires. These third parties can get quite large. Some examples include <a href="https://www.gen2fund.com/" target="_blank">Gen II Fund Services</a>, <a href="https://www.bbh.com/en-us" target="_blank">Brown Brothers Harriman</a>, or <a href="https://www.ssctech.com/solutions/products-a-to-z/private-equity-services" target="_blank">SS&amp;C</a>. Larger firms often build an in-house team to manage these operations. But regardless of the specific organizational setup, the work tends to be quite similar, and the pressure on maintaining cost and accuracy leads to more <a href="https://www.privatefundscfo.com/7-reasons-us-private-equity-firms-are-finally-outsourcing-their-fund-administration/" target="_blank">focus</a> on automation.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This post is a guide to the operational, money movement aspects of private investing. While the specifics of the investments and the horizon for repayment might vary widely, we hope that this guide is useful in simplifying and demystifying how a fund might automate some of its internal operations.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><h4>The User Experience</h4><p>Let’s start with defining the user experience for a new fund. Let’s say our new team, which is expert in bagels, believes there’s a wave of innovation coming to that space. With Sesame, Everything, and Pumpernickel showing success in the market, more is coming. So, the team launches Bagel Ventures and raises a new venture fund (“Bagel Ventures I”) to invest in startups. They will raise their fund from 10 limited partners (LPs) who are the endowments, pension funds, and individuals investing in the fund. Bagel Ventures will not receive all the funds at the outset. Rather, they will ask for funds as they prepare for a new investment, and receive “capital calls” from each of the 10 LPs.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The fund flow might involve the following steps:</p><ol role="list"><li>The team identifies a new investment (“Have you heard of pickle bagels?!”).</li><li>The Fund sends capital call requests to all LPs, and receives 10 wires, one per LP.</li><li>The Fund wires the investment to the company.&nbsp;</li><li>After a while, the company sells and the Fund receives their share of the proceeds.</li><li>The Fund distributes the proceeds to the LPs, each getting what they are due, and keeps a carry fee for itself.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><p>In reality, things might be more complex. There could be multiple funding rounds for a company, and it might be a mixture of equity and debt. We haven’t accounted for fees. For simplicity’s sake, we will use only the case outlined above of a single investment round followed by an exit, and develop a payment ops architecture based on that.<br></p><p>‍</p><h4>Payment Ops Architecture</h4><p>Before setting up any payment flows, Bagel Ventures has to establish a banking relationship and open accounts. There might be an Operating Account for the fund for things such as payroll, rent, and other expenses, and a separate Investing Account for investments and distributions. For the purposes of this payment ops architecture, we’ll consider just the Investing Account.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Let’s assume you build for the following setup:&nbsp;<em>‍</em></p><figure id="w-node-2886e96df8b3-b8df1e0f"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d7e7bbbcad517dd46cb55d3/5f467bc3a95047322fd177eb_Fund%20Custodian%202.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Investment phase: many capital call wires come in to the Investing Account to fund one investment wire to be sent to the company.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-9be230dca25d-b8df1e0f"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d7e7bbbcad517dd46cb55d3/5f467b9c6f1a0d0f38966c77_Fund%20Custodian%201.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Exit phase: company sells, one wire arrives to the investing Account and is split into wires sent to many LP accounts and one Fund Operating Account for carry.</figcaption></figure><p>The Fund custodian team and software will oversee the regular collection and disbursement of investment funds, and make sure that everything is tracked and reconciled accordingly.</p><p>‍</p><h4>API Calls and Timings</h4><p>With this payment ops architecture in hand, we’re ready to build.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h5>Step 1: Collect bank account details from LPs and from the Company</h5><p>Bagel Ventures first needs to collect the Company’s bank account details. Let’s call the company Pickle Bagels, Inc., and its first product is pickle bagels. To do so, you first create a counterparty in Modern Treasury, and populate it with the bank account and routing numbers you have received (<a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/how-to-collect-and-verify-bank-accounts-for-ach" target="_blank">more here</a> on common methods of authenticating accounts, such as Plaid):<br></p><h6>curl --request POST \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;-u ORGANIZATION_ID:API_KEY \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;--url https://app.moderntreasury.com/api/counterparties \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;-d '{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"name": "Pickle Bagels, Inc.",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"accounts": [<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"account_type": "checking",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"routing_details": [<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"routing_number_type": "aba",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"routing_number": "121141822"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;],<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"account_details": [<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"account_number": "123456789"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;]}'</h6><p>In addition to the account and routing number, you might want to hold additional information about the counterparty in metadata. This information might include how much of the fund that LP invested, any unique arrangements, and other information.</p><p>‍</p><h5>Step 2: Collect capital call wires</h5><p>A counterparty creation response will notify you that everything has been successfully set up. Now that a counterparty exists, you can initiate payments to or from LPs. If LPs allow this, you can ACH debit them for their contribution. More likely, however, the large amounts prevent the use of ACH and the preference is for wires, primarily because ACH is reversible and wires are not. To identify and automatically match the incoming wire, you can create an Expected Payment object for each incoming wire with the information you expect, such as amount, counterparty, payment type, and date range.&nbsp;This can be done over API&nbsp;or manually. As an example, here's what this might look like done manually: </p><figure id="w-node-2629a0d055b5-b8df1e0f"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d7e7bbbcad517dd46cb55d3/5f4707cc10e4094e68ff9005_Screen%20Shot%202020-08-26%20at%206.04%201.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Now, once the expected payment is set up Modern Treasury will scan the account for this incoming information and automatically match it when it’s received. Alternatively, if the LP did not send the wire and the end of the date range has arrived, Modern Treasury will notify you that the fund has not received the expected funds.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h5>Step 3: Fund the investment</h5><p>Once the funds have all arrived, you can fund the investment in Pickle Bagels, Inc. Let’s say Pickle Bagels is getting $10,000,000 from our Fund in this investment round, and is planning on A/B testing bagels and seeing which ones are gone fastest. Given the amount, you will most likely choose to send that amount via wire. Note that the amount is in cents, not dollars, so it shows up as 1000000000:<br></p><h6>curl --request POST \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;-u ORGANIZATION_ID:API_KEY \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;--url https://app.moderntreasury.com/api/payment_orders \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;-d '{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"type": "wire",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"amount": 1000000000,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"direction": "credit",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"currency": "USD",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"originating_account": "Bagel Ventures account ID",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"receiving_account_id": "Pickle Bagels bank account ID",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"counterparty_id": "Pickle Bagels counterparty ID"<br>}'</h6><p>Once the payment goes through, the Fund account will be debited $10,000,000 and the Company will be funded for its next phase of bagel testing.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, you want to add metadata to the payment for future reference. In addition to metadata tags (eg. key value pairs such as Type: SeriesA or Sector: Bageltech) you might also attach the PDF for the legal docs, or the CSV calculating the amounts, for future reference. This will be useful for finance and audit teams that might have to answer questions about this payment in the future.</p><p>‍</p><h5>Step 3: Receive funds at exit</h5><p>Now, after what could be a few months or a decade, Pickle Bagels, Inc. might sell and the fund will register a return on its investment. For simplicity, let’s assume the company sells in an all-cash transaction such that each investment comes back as a cash disbursement based on the terms of the sale agreement.&nbsp;</p><p>The Fund is notified that it will receive $30,000,000 back from the investment, tripling its original investment. In that case, you can set up an Expected Payment for the incoming funds, just as in Step 2 above, and reconcile an incoming wire when it comes in from the acquiring company.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><h5>Step 4: Disburse the investment return</h5><p>Finally, once you’ve reconciled the incoming wire, you can collect the Fund’s fees by transferring those funds to the Operating account, and setting up a disbursal to each of the investors in ten separate wires.&nbsp;<br></p><p>That’s it. With these four actions you can set up the payment ops architecture for a simple private investment fund and focus on finding the right entrepreneurs and companies to back and invest in.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><h4>What Can Go Wrong?</h4><p>Payment operations software, such as <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/" target="_blank">Modern Treasury</a>, can manage not only the happy path as described above but also edge cases when things go wrong. A common issue could be handling an ACH return associated with a specific <a href="https://docs.moderntreasury.com/reference#ach-return-reason-codes" target="_blank">return code</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Another might be a customer service issue if an LP funds too little or too much funds, combines two investments in one, or makes some other unexpected action. In that case, there might be a new transaction necessary or an explanatory note for future reconciliations or audits. Ops teams can process these easily while maintaining the integrity of the data, since all payments sent or received are easily captured and displayed. In the future, accountants and auditors won’t be left wondering about a wire, since the information explaining it can be captured directly tied to the bank statement in question.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><h4>More?</h4><p>This post laid out a simple architecture for payment ops at a VC or PE fund, …</p></div></div></div>

			<p>Open AI’s GPT-3 has been in the news a lot recently for a number of reasons. Developers have used this new API to do things from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/16/21371049/gpt3-hacker-news-ai-blog">writing blog posts that make it to the top of Hacker News</a>, to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/10-things-gpt-3-can-do-examples-and-use-cases/slidelist/77449901.cms#slideid=77450339">creating search engines and more</a>.</p>
<p>Today, we’re happy to announce you can add <strong>podcasts</strong> to the list of things GPT-3 is beginning to revolutionize!</p>
<p>The HyperCatcher app has now applied this exciting technology to our premium podcasts. Using GPT-3 and a little other magic you can now view a summary of your favorite podcasts before you listen. You can even jump past topics you’re not interested in (or commercials) and get to the good stuff more easily than ever!</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/g6p.a50.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-08-19-22.06.45.gif" alt="" width="321" height="671"></figure>
<h2>How Did We Do It?</h2>
<p>GPT-3 is a cutting edge machine learning model that’s been trained on content across the internet. This makes GPT-3 the perfect model for creative text generation. GPT-3 or a subsequent Machine Learning model from OpenAI might be great at creating podcasts from scratch one day given a topic, but we’re not quite there yet. One step removed from whole cloth podcast creation is summarizing existing podcasts and that’s exactly what we’re using GPT-3 for!</p>
<p>With GPT-3 the hard part is coming up with the right question and the right format for the question that will prompt the AI to fill in the answer with the right mix of creativity and understanding of the given question.</p>
<p>For example, if you sign up for Open AI’s beta you’ll get access to the GPT-3 playground that comes loaded with some preset prompts. One of these prompts is:</p>
<p>My second grader asked me what this passage means:</p>
<p>From here you can fill in the paragraph with a sample passage. For example, we could use a paragraph of text from a podcast like so:</p>
<p><em>My second grader asked me what this passage means:</em></p>
<p><em>“they age they saved money for a rainy day but this is four months that’s a long time miss you know what it’s not eat but it is to live a normal life with a car payment and a mortgage and a Verizon bill yeah that’s a lot of money but but you know what people shouldn’t have car payments”</em></p>
<p>Plugging this into the GPT-3 playground we might get a result like this:</p>
<p><em>I told her that it meant he was going to miss her and be sad because she’s not there. She said, “no, I think he’s saying that he doesn’t have a car payment.”</em></p>
<p>That’s pretty creative, but it’s not exactly a summary of the given text</p>
<p>This is where some of the parameters given by the API allow us to tweak the creativity and length of the response come in handy. In addition to tweaking parameters we might also give a few examples of what we consider “good” summaries of text that GPT-3 can use as a reference.</p>
<p>After applying those changes GPT-3 will give us something more like this:</p>
<p><em>“People shouldn’t have car payments.”</em></p>
<p>Now, we can basically feed a transcript of the entire podcast to GPT-3 in chunks and retrieve summaries of each part of the podcast that can be displayed to users!</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.ultrabug.fr/scylla-summit-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scylla summit 2019</a> I had the chance to meet <strong>Israel Fruchter</strong> and we dreamed of working on adding <strong>shard-awareness</strong> support to the Python cassandra-driver which would be known as <strong>scylla-driver</strong>.</p>



<p>A few months later, when Israel reached out to me on the Scylla-Users #pythonistas Slack channel with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/scylladb/python-driver/pull/6" target="_blank">first draft PR</a> I was so excited that I jumped in the wagon to help!</p>



<p>The efforts we put into the scylla-driver paid off and significantly improved the performance of the production applications that I had the chance to switch to using it by 15 to 25%!</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="587" src="https://www.ultrabug.fr/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-07-23-174931_1276x731_scrot-1024x587.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.ultrabug.fr/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-07-23-174931_1276x731_scrot-1024x587.png 1024w, https://www.ultrabug.fr/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-07-23-174931_1276x731_scrot-300x172.png 300w, https://www.ultrabug.fr/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-07-23-174931_1276x731_scrot-768x440.png 768w, https://www.ultrabug.fr/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-07-23-174931_1276x731_scrot-1200x687.png 1200w, https://www.ultrabug.fr/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-07-23-174931_1276x731_scrot.png 1276w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Before we reached those numbers and even released the scylla-driver to PyPi, EuroPython 2020 RFP was open and <a href="https://ep2020.europython.eu/talks/a-deep-dive-and-comparison-of-python-drivers-for-cassandra-and-scylla/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I submitted a talk proposal which was luckily accepted </a>by the community.</p>



<p>So I had the chance to deep-dive into Cassandra vs Scylla architecture differences, explain the rationale behind creating the scylla-driver and give Python code details on how we implemented it and the challenges we faced doing so. Check my talk spage for </p>



<p>I also explained that I wrote an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://groups.google.com/g/scylladb-dev/c/SUx0OBlY7iw" target="_blank">RFC on the scylla-dev mailing list</a> which lead the developers of Scylla to implement a new connection-to-shard algorithm that will allow clients connecting to a new listening port to select the actual shard they want a connection to.</p>



<p>This is an expected major optimization from the current mostly random way of connecting to all shards and I’m happy to say that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/scylladb/scylla/commit/1572b9e41cd02e8b676404ba72a549398d281a66" target="_blank">it’s been implemented</a> and is ready to be put to use by all the scylla drivers.</p>



<p>I’ve recently been contacted by PyCon India and other Python related conferences organizers for a talk so I’ve submitted one to PyCon India where I hope I’ll be able to showcase even better numbers thanks to the new algorithm!</p>



<p>After my Europython talk we also had very interesting discussions with Pau Freixes about his work on a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/pfreixes/acsylla" target="_blank">fully asynchronous Python driver that wraps the C++ driver</a> to get the best possible performance. First results are absolutely amazing so if you’re interested in this, make sure to give it a try and contribute to the driver!</p>



<p>Stay tuned for more amazing query latencies 😉</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>A few weeks ago, for various reasons I decided to start reading a neuroscience textbook (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123858702/fundamental-neuroscience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fundamental Neuroscience</a>). Though dense, it’s packed with interesting information that filled a lot of gaps in my knowledge about the brain.</p>
<p>One of those gaps was about how exactly the information travels through a neuron. Up to this point, all I knew was “something involving electric pulses”. </p>
<p>The reality, it turns out, is more interesting: neurons use ion channels to create and strengthen electric signals, and propagate information along their lengths.</p>
<p>So here is more or less how I understand this so far.</p>
<p>First, a quick recap of the neuron structure.</p>
<p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/the-magic-of-ion-channels/neuron-overview.png" alt="A typical neuron. Source: your brain."></p>
<p>A neuron has the main cell body. From that body, it grows a large number of branched extensions called “dendrites”. These usually serve as the input “wires”, though they also do some signal processing. </p>
<p>Neuron usually also grows another long extension called an “axon”. This is normally the cell’s output, and it can be up to a meter long in humans, though in the brain it’s usually shorter.</p>
<p>Let’s zoom in to the axon. First, we’ll look at shorter axons, because longer ones have myelin sheath, which will complicate the picture.</p>
<p>The fluid inside the neuron (cytoplasm) and the intercellular fluid between the neurons have a number of ions dissolved in them: calcium (Ca²⁺), potassium (K⁺), sodium (Na⁺), chlorine (Cl⁻), and others.</p>
<p>For various reasons, neurons actively work to pump out Na⁺, Ca²⁺, and Cl⁻, so these are much more concentrated outside the cell than inside the cell. If the membrane wasn’t keeping them out, they’d quickly rush into the cell. Some still leak back in.</p>
<p>Similarly, neurons actively work to concentrate K⁺ inside.</p>
<p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/the-magic-of-ion-channels/pumping-ions.png" alt="A crude depiction of a Na⁺-K⁺ pump, one of the mechanisms maintaining the ion balance in the neuron. Na⁺-K⁺ pump removes three Na⁺ ions for two K⁺ ions."></p>
<p>Each of the ions carries a charge, so the end result of this pumping is that the cell’s inside is negatively charged relative to the outside. This voltage difference is called the “membrane potential”. Resting membrane potential is typically between -75 and -40 mV (millivolts).</p>
<p>Ion channels are small valves set in the cell’s surface that let ions through if certain conditions are met. Some are opened by specific chemicals binding to them (e.g. neurotransmitters), while others open when the voltage inside the cell rises high enough. The latter are called “voltage-gated ion channels”, and they’re the ones we’re interested in.</p>
<p>Voltage-gated ion channels exist on all parts of a neuron, but are most concentrated in the axon. Most let through a specific ion: there are Na⁺ channels, K⁺ channels, Ca²⁺ channels, etc. </p>
<p>Let’s take a look at how Na⁺ channels and K⁺ channels would work to produce a voltage spike (called an “action potential”). </p>
<p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/the-magic-of-ion-channels/ion-channels-1.png" alt="Neuron membrane in resting state. Channels are closed; membrane voltage is around -73 mV."></p>
<p>If something increases the cell membrane voltage to -55 mV, Na⁺ channels quickly open and let in a lot of Na⁺ ions. These ions carry a positive charge, so they quickly raise the voltage across the membrane to +30 mV. Then the channels automatically close. This happens over the span of milliseconds.</p>
<p>At the same time, K⁺ channels open and start letting out some K⁺ ions, opposing the Na⁺ current and slowing the voltage increase. The channels first open slowly, but after a while, the K⁺ current strengthens. </p>
<p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/the-magic-of-ion-channels/ion-channels-2.png" alt="Voltage spikes up after the channels open. Na⁺ are flowing quickly, and K⁺ are flowing slowly. Na⁺ channel is about to close."></p>
<p>To start, Na+ channels dominate, but after they close, K⁺ outflow quickly makes the membrane voltage drop. This drop overshoots the initial resting level before leveling off at the voltage where K⁺ concentrations stay stable.</p>
<p>Then K⁺ channels gradually close.</p>
<p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/the-magic-of-ion-channels/ion-channels-3.png" alt=" Na⁺ channel is closed. K⁺ has concentrations have leveled off around -73 mV, where K⁺ ions are equally likely to enter and exit the membrane."></p>
<p>The total number of ions exchanged throughout the whole process is minuscule, and has little impact on the overall concentration of ions inside or outside the cell.</p>
<p>When the channels create a voltage spike, they then trigger other nearby channels, which then trigger other channels, and so on. This makes the voltage spike travel down the length of the neuron. </p>
<p>The ion channels usually take time to reset before the next firing, so a single voltage spike doesn’t usually set off the entire neuron ringing indefinitely. However, the voltage can propagate from the base of the axon back into the dendrites, where it can play an important role in influencing whether the next incoming signal will set off the ion channels there.</p>
<p>Neurons are somewhat conductive, but not <em>very</em> conductive - they’re not copper wires. They’re also leaky - a large portion of their current seeps out into the surrounding intercellular fluid, partly because the cell membrane is not 100% impermeable to ions, and partly because of the membrane capacitance.  </p>
<p>That means that if a given ion channel generates some voltage locally, that voltage will quickly drop off as we move farther from that channel.</p>
<p>So the ion channels cannot be spaced too far apart, and the signal will travel only as fast as the channels can open and close between the start and the end of the axon.</p>
<p>Vertebrates (including humans) have a clever innovation to speed up the propagation of signals: they use myelin sheaths to insulate axons that travel over distances longer than millimeters.</p>
<p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/the-magic-of-ion-channels/myelin-sheath.svg" alt="Myelin sheaths surrounding an axon of the peripheral nervous system (i.e. outside the brain or spine). Source: &quot;Anatomy and Physiology&quot; by the US National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program."></p>
<p>Myelin sheaths form in 0.2- 1 mm segments over the neurons and are made from layers of cell membrane and protein made by the dedicated cells - oligodendrocytes in the brain and spinal cord, and by Schwann cells everywhere else.</p>
<p>Myelin significantly thickens the axon’s wall and reduces the amount of current leaked out through the cell membrane. This allows the myelinated neuron to space their ion channels farther apart, significantly speeding up the propagation of the voltage spikes.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was thinking about who has given me the most knowledge over the years.</p>



<p>People who have taught me a lot include:</p>



<ul><li>My bosses (who tend to do the same type of work that I do rather than being dedicated managers)</li><li>My coworkers (who aren’t there to specifically teach me, but they learn and share knowledge as they go)</li><li>Random people on Stack Overflow and in blog posts found via Google</li></ul>



<p>And that leaves the people who haven’t taught me as much:</p>



<ul><li>Dedicated managers who don’t get their hands dirty </li><li>Coaches and trainers who coach and train full time</li><li>Professional authors, speakers, podcasters, bloggers, etc.</li></ul>



<p><em>I’ve learned the most from the doers rather than the trainers</em>. That’s the common theme, but I’m not totally sure why that is.</p>



<p>There are 2 obvious theories:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Theory 1</strong>: Plain old cognitive bias on my part, in that I’m more likely to listen to the doers since I subconsciously believe they’re more likely to know what they’re talking about.</li><li><strong>Theory 2</strong>: The doers <em>really do </em>know what they’re talking about more than the trainers, so knowledge from doers tends to be more useful.</li></ul>



<p>Maybe it’s a combination of those, or maybe it’s something else entirely.</p>



<p>Andy Matuschak wrote a little essay called “<a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zUMFE66dxeweppDvgbNAb5hukXzXQu8ErVNv">People who write extensively about note-writing rarely have a serious context of use</a>” which fits nicely here. He says there are 2 reasons for this phenomenon:</p>



<blockquote><p>There are two related problems here:&nbsp;effective system design <em>requires insights drawn from serious contexts of use</em>, and&nbsp;powerful enabling environments usually arise as a <em>byproduct of projects pursuing their own intrinsically meaningful purposes</em>.</p><cite>Andy Matuschak</cite></blockquote>



<p>Sounds like Andy thinks my <strong>Theory 2</strong> is correct. <em>You have to do the thing to really understand how to be effective at it, because the effectiveness arises naturally out of the doing</em>. If you’re not doing it, then you won’t really understand<em> </em>it, and teaching something that you don’t really understand<em> </em>is little more than recitation. And “I used to do the thing before I became a trainer” isn’t enough, because it doesn’t take long for knowledge to become outdated.</p>



<p>Brene Brown says it more simply:</p>



<blockquote><p>If you are not in the arena getting your ass kicked on occasion, I’m not interested in or open to your feedback.</p><cite>“Dare To Lead” by Brene Brown</cite></blockquote>



<p>She’s referencing this famous Teddy Roosevelt quote:</p>



<blockquote><p>The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming</p><cite>Teddy Roosevelt, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_in_a_Republic#:~:text=The%20credit%20belongs%20to%20the,knows%20great%20enthusiasms%2C%20the%20great">Citizenship in a Republic</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>(Seems a little dramatic here, since a face “marred by dust and sweat and blood” means sitting at a desk staring at a computer, but hush and go with it.)</p>



<p>So if <strong>Theory 2</strong> is correct, and that we can learn less from dedicated managers and trainers than from doers, what is the value of them? I’m thinking people like:</p>



<ul><li>Productivity bloggers and YouTubers, like the people Andy’s talking about (see this <a href="https://xkcd.com/874/">relevant XKCD</a>)</li><li>Agile coaches who haven’t worked inside a real project in years except as a coach</li><li>Full time managers tasked with helping developers grow despite maybe never having done any development themselves</li></ul>



<p>(Important caveat: some dedicated trainers are also doers because they keep their edge with side projects or consulting gigs, etc. These people are the cream of the crop.)</p>



<p>Maybe their value is in the volume. Maybe it’s a numbers game. Doers have more valuable knowledge, but they’re too busy doing to spread as much of it. Dedicated trainers spend all their time spreading knowledge, so even if their knowledge is 50% less valuable, they can spend 500% more time spreading it. </p>



<p>But if that were the case, then I would have learned more from them than from the doers. So maybe that’s where <strong>Theory 1</strong> comes into play, and my cognitive bias has gotten in the way of me getting as much value from dedicated trainers as I could have.</p>



<p>I don’t know, I’m still pondering. What do you think? <a href="https://twitter.com/mcrittenden">Tweet at me</a>.</p>

                        <p>In this essay, I’ll tell you a bit about early seeds of democracy in China during the period 1900-1949. Contrary to popular belief, this period was surprisingly modern and open. It starts towards the end of the Qing dynasty (大清, 1644-1912), goes through Republic of China (中華民國, 1912-1949*), and ends with Mao's People’s Republic Of China (中華人民共和國, 1949-).</p><p>This period - as well as the half century before - saw an increase in western influence. Militarily, this started with the British defeating China in the Opium War (1842) and the following Treaty of Nanjing, after which many events followed (another Opium War, more treaties, Sino-Japanese war, suppression of Boxer uprising, etc). This meant that there were treaty ports that were under foreign control by the French, British, Japanese, United States, etc. The former great Chinese empire lost a lot of its power. The current PRC government calls this the Century of humiliation (百年耻辱, 1842-1949).</p><p>Whether guns or books came first, this was also accompanied by an increased interest in western ideas. Western books were translated, a lot of them via Japanese. For example, Yan Fu (嚴復, 1854-1921) translated classics by people such as Darwin, Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Herbert Spencer, Montesquieu, etc around the turn of the century. <sup><a href="#notes">[1]</a></sup></p><p>Before these translations, certain Western concepts such as freedom or liberty didn’t exist. <em>Ziyou</em> (自由) came from a translation of John Stuart Mill’s <strong>On Liberty</strong> (possibly as a loan word via Japanese). The story is more complex than that, where concepts don’t always naturally map, and during e.g. Song dynasty the phrase appears to have been used, but without the political connotations.</p><p>A lot of this interest in Western ideas came from local individuals and merchants who perhaps were educated in the west and lived in Shanghai and similar treaty ports. Many of them were standing with one foot in Chinese culture and one in Western, and found ways to reconcile these, sometimes compatible sometimes contradictory, systems of thinking. They didn’t see Chinese culture as being incompatible with democracy. Instead, they faulted politics, specifically one party rule and civil strife. <sup><a href="#notes">[2]</a></sup>.</p><p>Due to wars and foreign intervention, the central government was fairly weak. However, in many places the local and provincial government was more powerful. In Chinese governance, like in many other countries, there is a clear distinction between the local, provincial and national levels. <sup><a href="#notes">[3]</a></sup> This era, with a weak national government, is often called the Warlord Era (軍閥時代).</p><figure><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/China_imperialism_cartoon.jpg" alt="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/China_imperialism_cartoon.jpg"><figcaption>Political cartoon showing foreign powers carving up China. [16]</figcaption></figure><p>The term ’warlord’ brings images of military autocrats, chaos and mayhem. While there is some truth to that, the term itself was often used as a form of propaganda. Warlordism or militarism internally in China was linked to Western imperialism. <sup><a href="#notes">[4]</a></sup></p><p>Looking at casualties between major wars during 1917-1930, there were 400,000 deaths. This might seem like a lot, but China has a big population, and this was spread out over a long period of time. Rawski estimates that deaths from all causes at the time was 13.5 million per year, which means only one out of 500 deaths occurred on the battle field. <sup><a href="#notes">[5]</a></sup> This should also be compared with the 20m+ deaths during rebellions in 19th century, or millions killed during Mao era.</p><p>Hu Shih (胡適, 1891-1962), a famous philosopher and diplomat who studied in the US with John Dewey (school of pragmatism), noticed that a lot of the violence during the Warlord Era came from attempts to unify China from above.</p><blockquote>In a country as large as China, no matter how strong an order imposed from the centre, it would eventually produce division; well-run, self-administered localities, he believed, could knit the country together. <sup><a href="#notes">[6]</a></sup></blockquote><p>In other words, a voice for pragmatic localism and self-governance.</p><p>While explaining the origins of the Nationalist Party (KMT, 國民黨) and Communist Party (CCP, 中國共產黨) is not part of this essay, their names are pretty self-explanatory. They were both against Western imperialism, in their own way, and were trying to fill the gap after the Qing empire. There is an idea of 'revolution as history' where we focus largely on the history of revolutions and their proponents. Often these people are less important than they might appear. It is easy to look at this period and focus only on the Nationalist Party and Communist Party, but there were many other people and ideas that don’t fit neatly into this two party divide. They had their own interests, and had a big impact in terms of driving ideas of freedom and democracy. <sup><a href="#notes">[7]</a></sup></p><figure><img src="https://laosima.com/content/images/2020/08/image-2.png" alt=""><figcaption>Shanghai Street in early 1900s. [17]</figcaption></figure><p>In the early years during the twentieth century, several places in China had various forms of local elections.</p><p>Shanghai saw early democratic institutions in the form of a city council, which was outside of the Shanghai’s International Settlement. <sup><a href="#notes">[8]</a></sup> In 1907, the Shanghai General Works Board extended voting rights to everyone who was a resident for more than five years and paid a minimum amount of local taxes. This followed similar events in Tianjin City council elections the year prior. <sup><a href="#notes">[9]</a></sup></p><p>In 1909 China held elections with an elite of two million people. This was later expanded in 1912 to 40 million people. Fincher writes:</p><blockquote>these freely contested, and at the time, well reported elections produced representative assemblies which ended the world’s oldest monarchy, proclaimed Asia’s first republic, and practiced liberal democracy. <sup><a href="#notes">[10]</a></sup></blockquote><p>He later continues:</p><blockquote>as measured by electorate size, the Chinese polity had advanced in 1909 from the standard set in the Japanese election of 1890 of slightly more than 1 percent (of a population of 40 million) to slightly less than 2 percent (of 400 million). In 1912 the Chinese polity achieved a standard (10 per cent of 400 million) which Japan did not reach until 1928, in the first election to follow implementation in Japan of universal male suffrage. <sup><a href="#notes">[11]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Sun Yat-Sen (孫中山, 1866-1925) was the first leader of KMT, and the first president of the Republic Of China. He was well-read on the European Enlightenment and Chinese culture and attempted to bridge them in his own way. The plan was to have the "Nationalist revolution" in three phases, with the first being a violent unification of China, and the last being democratic constitutional rule. <sup><a href="#notes">[12]</a></sup> Unsurprisingly, they didn’t get to the latter phase.</p><p>One of the most important features of democracy, to be able to vote people out of office and keep them accountable with a rule of law, was missing from the very start:</p><blockquote>He left no notion as to how Chinese politics should be institutionalized, for his thought on public administration did not include ways of preventing those in authority from abusing their powers <sup><a>[13]</a></sup></blockquote><p>As Chiang Kai-shek (蔣中正, 1887-1975) eventually took over, it became more like a personal dictatorship with everything you’d expect from such a regime. <sup><a href="#notes">[14]</a></sup> There was one upside though. Unlike the communists, with the Nationalist government intellectuals could enjoy the freedom of silence. Generally speaking, intellectuals survived the Nationalist rule, unlike during CCP's rule. <sup><a href="#notes">[15]</a></sup></p><p>For whatever reason, liberal opposition and the third force failed. The CCP took over China, and KMT ended up in Taiwan (台灣). In Taiwan, more measures were taken, and it failed there as well. For a while, until it succeeded. But that’s a story for another time.</p><figure><img src="https://laosima.com/content/images/2020/08/shanghai1946.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><em>Exodus from Shanghai in 1949. [18]</em></figcaption></figure><p>Should we look at the current CCP government as a continuation of great empires, as they would like to see themselves, or something else?</p><p>Europe had kings and monarchies for a long time before modern democracy developed during the last few hundred years. As people get exposed to more ideas, we see which forms of governance works better. While progress isn’t linear or even necessarily a well-defined thing, useful systems tends to survive and fragile systems die out.</p><p>This is one of the reasons why you can't talk about e.g. Taiwan in mainland China. Many would argue that the CCP is afraid of its own people, and Taiwan shows what "Chinese democracy" might look like.</p><p>We can look at the period from 1900 to 1949 as an intermission, or at the current regime as an aberration that is going against a global trend that has been unfolding over hundreds of year.

                <p>
                  In 2011, Apple released
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Lion">Mac OS X Lion</a>
                  which introduced an enhanced scrollbar behavior that made
                  scrollbars hidden by default. The scrollbar appears when the
                  user starts scrolling a document and disappears after the
                  scrolling stops.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It appears, however, that this enhancement did not only change
                  the user interface, but has also shaped how developers (don't)
                  think about that specific UI element when creating
                  cross-platform solutions. I call it
                  <strong>scrollbar blindness</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lately, for some reason, I've started to notice more of it. I
                  have been to numerous websites that have elements with
                  <code>overflow-y</code> or <code>overflow-x</code> set to
                  <code>scroll</code> while the element is not meant to be
                  scrollable. For no apparent reason, some even set both
                  <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> axes scrollable or create
                  multiple levels of stacked scrollbars.
                </p>
                <h2>Comparison</h2>
                <p>
                  Here's a side-by-side comparison of the same scrollbar-heavy
                  containers rendered by Firefox on Linux (with scrollbars) and
                  MacOS (without).
                </p>

                <h2>Examples</h2>
                <p>
                  Here are some examples of scrollbar blindness I've stumbled

                        underneath document's scrollbar. This produces a very
                        confusing user experience as the view is scrollable, but
                        the (document's) scrollbar is not moving. After
                        scrolling to the bottom of the modal, document's

                    horizontal scrollbars. In mobile view, some containers are
                    given an extra scrollbar.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  As can be seen from the examples, even big organizations like
                  Github and Snapchat that have tens if not a hundred front-end
                  developers and probably have a code review process in place,
                  let the problem slip through. I collected these examples
                  months ago and the scrollbars are still just as I found them.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  If you are a front-end developer that uses macOS, I kindly ask
                  you to dedicate a little more attention to how the websites
                  you create behave on platforms other than your own.
                  Alternatively, you can set the scrollbars to be visible at all
                  times by setting
                  <code>System Preferences -&gt; General -&gt; Show scroll bars</code>
                  to <code>Always</code>.
                </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL started back in 2012 at Facebook HQ. Before being publicly released in 2015 it was used internally as a cure to the underperformance observed in mobile apps on slower networks. GraphQL is a query language for APIs, its main advantage is allowing clients to define exactly what type of data is required. The centerpiece of any GraphQL project is its schema.</p>
<p><strong>GraphQL schema</strong> is a set of rules describing the functionality available to the client, including specification of operations (queries and mutations) that can be executed to execute against your data graph. </p>
<p>If you ever decide to build a GraphQL service at some point you would need to chose which approach you want to affiliate with more:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schema-first</strong> - prioritizing process of designing the schema,</li>
<li><strong>Code-first (resolver-first)</strong> - approach prioritizing code over schema, where the GraphQL schema is generated programmatically.</li>
</ul>
<p>In either case, we will end up with a fully functional GraphQL service, but this choice will influence your project in terms of the amount of work you will need to put to achieve certain things like scaling your project etc.</p>

<h2>Schema-first</h2>
<p>Schema-first is an approach that puts schema as your source of truth and forces your code to follow the definitions stored in your schema. In general, prioritizing thinking about the schema. If schema design falls short, you might end up with an API that’s ignoring your business needs and needs of your end-users.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>it should most of the times results in a better-designed API,</li>
<li>it’s more abstract and less dependent by following the dependency inversion principle (DIP),</li>
<li>Schema-first approach reduces development time by allowing frontend and backend teams simultaneously (schema data is easily mockable i.e. with <a href="https://app.graphqleditor.com/explore-projects/twitter">graphql-editor mock backend feature 🚀</a>),</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some of the cons/difficulties:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the schema definition must be constantly synced with the resolvers, otherwise might cause serious problems,</li>
<li>might lead to code redundancy as SDL definitions are not so easily reusable,</li>
<li>difficulty in combining distributed schemas into a single schema (require using 3rd party tools like <a href="http://graphqleditor.com/">graphql-editor</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-tools">graphql-tools</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Code-first</h2>
<p>Code-first (often called resolver-first) is a process where the schema is defined and implemented programmatically. The design process begins with coding the resolvers and the SDL version of the GraphQL schema is a generated artifact (created with a script, not manually). </p>
<p><strong>Some of the pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>can work as a single source of truth as it keeps stored both the schema definitions as well as resolvers,</li>
<li>code-first can  easily overcome difficulties met in schema-first approach, without the usage of a vast amount of tools,</li>
<li>better manageable if you expect your schema to grow in complexity or size,</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some of the cons/difficulties:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>having both the definitions and resolves might be less readable,</li>
<li>your API design is easier influenced by implementation rather than business needs,</li>
<li>backward-incompatible changes can slip in more easily compared to schema’s first approach.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The evolution</h2>
<p>When GraphQL was publicly released in the 2015 ecosystem we know haven’t existed (quite obvious) and the only things that we could lean on were the official GraphQL specification and <code>graphql-js</code> (the reference implementation in JavaScript) until 2016 when <code>graphql-tools</code> repo was founded which firstly promoted schema-first approach by separating two layers of working with schema:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>the schema definition</strong> - writing GraphQL schema definition using Schema Definition Language (SDL),</li>
<li><strong>the schema implementation</strong> - writing required resolvers. </li>
</ul>
<p>After that, the schema-first become default approach but seeing its limitations people started looking for some workarounds which led to first code-first frameworks being released. The Code-first approach is becoming so popular that almost every GraphQL implementation now has its code-first alternative, or even focusing on only the code-first path.</p>

                  <p>August 25, 2020<br></p>
                  
                  <p>Dear Colleagues,<br></p>
                  
                  <p>We would like to inform you about an upcoming major transition for the Journal of Field Robotics.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>After 15 years of service, John Wiley and Sons, the publisher has decided not to renew the <br></p>
                  <p>contract of the Editor in Chief (Sanjiv Singh) and the Managing Editor (Sanae Minick) and <br></p>
                  <p>hence our term will expire at the end of 2020.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>This comes after two years of discussions between new Wiley representatives and the <br></p>
                  <p>Editorial Board have failed to converge to a common set of principles and procedures by <br></p>
                  <p>which the journal should operate. The Editorial Board has unanimously decided to resign.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>We do want to assure the authors who have papers under review that we see it as our <br></p>
                  <p>responsibility to bring these documents to resolution during our term. We will continue to <br></p>
                  <p>process new submissions until the end of the year. More about the future at the end of this note.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>While the issue at the heart of our disagreement with Wiley is about academic independence, <br></p>
                  <p>it should be noted that there is a structural issue here. Scholarly publishing is broadly in flux <br></p>
                  <p>at the moment in the search for a sustainable model. Currently, academics are not paid to <br></p>
                  <p>create and review articles.&nbsp; In fact, they often have to pay fees to publish, and, readers have <br></p>
                  <p>to pay to access the work through a pay per view system, or, through subscriptions. <br></p>
                  <p><a title="https://www.coalition-s.org" href="https://www.coalition-s.org/">Plan S</a>, an international consortium makes the dilemma clear:<br></p>
                  
                  <p>"Monetising the access to new and existing research results is profoundly at odds <br></p>
                  <p>with the ethos of science (Merton, 1973 )… In the 21st century, science publishers <br></p>
                  <p>should provide a service to help researchers disseminate their results. They may <br></p>
                  <p>be paid fair value for the services they are providing, but no science should be locked <br></p>
                  <p>behind paywalls!"<br></p>
                  
                  <p>While this moment calls for creativity and collaboration with the scholarly community to find <br></p>
                  <p>new models, Wiley is intent on making broad changes to the way that the Journal of Field <br></p>
                  <p>Robotics is operated, guided mostly by an economic calculation to increase revenue and <br></p>
                  <p>decrease costs. To do this, they have unilaterally decided to change the terms of the <br></p>
                  <p>contract that has been constant since the JFR was started in 2005. Wiley has confronted a <br></p>
                  <p>similar case (European Law Journal) with similar effect— <a onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" title="https://europeanlawblog.eu/2020/02/04/what-a-journal-makes-as-we-say-goodbye-to-the-european-law-journal/" href="https://europeanlawblog.eu/2020/02/04/what-a-journal-makes-as-we-say-goodbye-to-the-european-law-journal/" onkeypress="window.open(this.href); return false;">the entire editorial board has <br></a></p>
                  <p><a onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" title="https://europeanlawblog.eu/2020/02/04/what-a-journal-makes-as-we-say-goodbye-to-the-european-law-journal/" href="https://europeanlawblog.eu/2020/02/04/what-a-journal-makes-as-we-say-goodbye-to-the-european-law-journal/" onkeypress="window.open(this.href); return false;">resigned in January of 2020:</a><span><br></span></p>
                  
                  <p>Wiley insists that the new contract is covered under a confidentiality agreement that not even <br></p>
                  <p>the Editorial Board can examine. What we can say is that the net effect of Wiley’s demands <br></p>
                  <p>would make the Editors contractors to the publisher rather than having them respond to the <br></p>
                  <p>board. We see this as a breach of academic autonomy.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>In resigning, the Editorial Board of the Journal of Field Robotics reaffirms its commitment to <br></p>
                  <p>dissemination and discussion of research. In the near future we will announce a new forum <br></p>
                  <p>for research in Field Robotics that will maintain the academic integrity of our editorial process <br></p>
                  <p>while also ensuring open dissemination of your research.<br></p>

<p>LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit (LiFT) was <a href="https://github.com/linkedin/LiFT">released</a> by the largest professional networking giant to enhance explainable AI initiatives by practitioners and organizations. This comes at the time when we are witnessing heated debate about the fairness of computer vision technology. Today, artificial intelligence is being used in a wide range of solutions right from identity authentication to determining defects in products and finding people with facial recognition. However, the lack of explainability in machine learning models has become a major roadblock that is hampering the proliferation of the latest technologies.</p>



<p>Although a wide range of libraries, services, and methodologies have been released in the last few years such as LIME, IBM Fairness 360 Toolkit, FAT-Forensics, DeepLIFT, Skater, SHAP, Rulex, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/explainable-ai">Google Explainable AI</a>, among others, the solutions have failed to democratize among users as they fail to deliver in large-scale problems or are very specific to cloud or use cases. Consequently, there was a need for a toolkit that can be leveraged across different platforms and problems.</p>

<p>This is where LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit bridges such gaps in the artificial intelligence landscape by enabling practitioners to deliver machine learning models to users without bias.</p>



<h3>LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit (LiFT)</h3>



<p>LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit is a Scala/Spark library that can evaluate biases in the entire lifecycle of model development workflows, even in large-scale machine learning projects. As per the release <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2020/lift-addressing-bias-in-large-scale-ai-applications">note</a> of LinkedIn, the library has broad utility for organizations that wish to conduct regular analyses of the fairness of their own models and data.</p>



<p>Since machine learning models are now actively used in healthcare and criminal justice, it is necessary for an explainable toolkit to find correlation among different categories effectively. Consequently, LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit is a near-perfect fit for such use cases as it can be deployed to measure biases in training data, detect statistically significant differences in models’ performance across different subgroups, and evaluate fairness in ad hoc analysis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit comes with a unique metric-agnostic <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05124">permutation testing</a> framework that identifies statistically significant differences in model performance (as measured according to any given assessment metric) across different subgroups. However, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05124">Evaluating Fairness Using Permutation Tests</a> methodology will appear at <a href="https://www.kdd.org/kdd2020/">KDD 2020</a>, the authors noted.</p>



<h3>What’s Behind LiFT?</h3>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/KJkaTpDgFNYr1LTch4SVU55G5IDOA8KJsUUR107DSQ09VjLkaeBz_Gofs14li-qlMFqxl7yR3A9YMXP6VjOWi__bELi5ABK-xuL2G2cfb1Lh1kES80MDzvhK2LaJIGDY1tGJools" alt=""><figcaption>LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit</figcaption></figure>



<p>Built to work effortlessly on large scale machine learning workflows, the library can be used at any stage of the models’ development. As a result, you can carry out ad hoc analysis and still interact with the library for explainability. While the library provides flexibility as it can be used in production and even on Jupyter Notebook, for scalability while measuring bias, it leverages Apache Spark to enable you to process a colossal amount of data distributed over numerous nodes.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SWa0QVPVLPbE-Ik_RcWWwfgcH_GhxYjmpXC2cr2UvOAD1aI43nhCIS7C3j5cw-5vNXFnQxkmJt3iQVtUCDxSFEpZYk-4K-u2e6L4Y2W_0JbaNy8W7OnvPfzPVofcQR5HqL34YtYu" alt=""><figcaption>High-level and low-level APIs</figcaption></figure>



<p>The design of the LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit also offers multiple interfaces based on the use cases with its high-level and low-level APIs for assessing fairness in models. While the high-level APIs can be used to compute metrics available, with parameterization handled by appropriate configuration classes, the low-level APIs enable users to integrate just a few metrics into their applications, or extend the provided classes to computer custom metrics.</p>



<p>LinkedIn has been using LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit for various machine learning models for explainability. For one, its job recommendation, when checked with LiFT, did not discriminate between gender. The model in production showed no significant difference in the probability of ranking a positive/relevant result above an irrelevant result between men and women.</p>

<p>By making the library open-source, the social media giant is committed to further enhancing its functionality. The <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/teams/data/artificial-intelligence">AI team at LinkedIn</a> is also working toward bringing fairness while eliminating bias for recommendation systems and ranking problems.</p>

<p>We will explain what User Personas are, what they are not, why every Designer should use them when building interfaces that target specific User Groups.</p>
<h2>What are User Personas?</h2>
<div><p>User experience designers (UX) use so called <i>user personas</i> in their creative process because they give answers to three simple questions related to building the best possible product presentation: “Who? What? Why?”. Personas are fictional characters that designers use to develop an accurate customer profile. They are part of intense product development strategies, and, with their help, companies achieve higher customer satisfaction rates.</p><p>But how a simple character sheet improves usability and connects vendors with their most potential customers?</p></div>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/blog/user-personas/user-personas-benefits.jpg" alt="User Personas Benefits Introduction"></p>
<h2>What to include in Personas Template?</h2>
<div><p>Personas can define a multitude of characters, based on further details like a specific product line, customer demographics, and more. Using an empathy map, for example, helps designers and sales specialists take a closer peek at their clients’ minds. These virtual characters help define what customers say, think, feel, and do in life, and especially what their view is about offered products and services.</p><p>Designers begin building the profile of that ideal client by gathering all possible user data. Important to note here is that accurate customer profiling does not necessarily mean borderline privacy breach. The base component for creating a good skeleton for a useful customer profile mostly consists of readily available data. Once designers round up all the relevant information, they can easily highlight general human behavior.</p><p>Although people differ vastly when directly compared, as customers, there are specific drives, motivations and conditions that allow marketers to funnel them into an easy to manage character categories, and use that to customize further the services they offer to them, and how they offer them. Personas are, after all, the answer to ‘Who? What? Why?’ of the ultimate user experience.</p><p>Depending on the project scope, profile data may all go in compiling a single virtual profile or become the base for multiple profiles, each addressing specific services, product categories, and so on. Most businesses use three to five different fictional customer profiles. While every Designer can personally shape up their persona profile, there are some general items worth including in the template.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/blog/user-personas/user-personas-sample-profile.jpg" alt="User Personas Sample Profile"></p>
<ol><li><b>Basic information</b><br>Create character names and titles wisely and avoid using them arbitrarily. Giving a real Persona name like Maria suggests that users are female, which will undoubtedly contribute to making the wrong decision. Persona’s title allows us to quickly reference a group of users with similarities relevant to the product in question. Designers need to make sure their persona titles are specific. If a persona carries the title “Influencer,” this may lead to more issues and complications, rather than narrow down customers by a viable factor. Does this group of people consist of students, freelancers, or prospects? What are their passions and motivations? Do you have an insight into their shopping patterns?</li>
<li><b>Demographics</b><br>This socio-economic feature is the key to your target market and includes factors like age, sex, location, education, religion. Although all of these can play a detrimental role in target audience campaigns, deep down the road, no two people are exactly alike. Two women who have the same age and live in the same area don’t necessarily share the same interests, needs, or pain-points. Demographics data is meaningless without an intense cross-analysis.</li>
<li><b>Job title, material status, family</b><br>Developing a marketable product is about a process that sells or serves real people. People who hold various jobs, care for a family, or mingle within social circles. Customer details reveal a lot about their goals and problems, and what they are as a person. All information — even features from outside the definition of ‘customer’ — can be translated into meaningful persona profiles.</li>
<li><b>Image</b><br>As humans, we interact with each other daily. Every normal interaction are great sources for lead designers, who use them when they try to give their persona a face. Images add a real feel about the user exact identity. Customer profiling is not always a straight forward process - sometimes, finding the right image requires nothing short of hard detective work. When done right, a relistic persona profile allows for certain personality traits to emerge from the raw data. Customers’ emotional and mental capacities are true indicators for intention, and images are powerful influencers of mood and <a href="https://enterprise.press/stories/2020/02/05/the-psychology-of-visuals-how-images-impact-decision-making-11273/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">decision-making</a>.</li>
<li><b>Pain points</b><br>Pain points are barriers that stand between your business intentions and how they reflect on the customer. When shaping the customer’s journey, the process does not come smooth automatically. There are often rough patches that need clearing. Unfortunately, clients may stumble on such ‘bumps on the road’ first-hand. For example, a page malfunction can cause visitors to collectively reach a dead while shopping or browsing. Additionally, pain points such as this one can be as diverse as the people who experience them. Finding, understanding, and solving these problems are the keys to successful design but are demanding in the variety of challenges. A few useful ways to diminish pain points are by constructing and executing online surveys. Make your sales team talkative with customers. interactive customer feedback like Online Reviews gives a piece of instantaneous information about potential problems.</li>
<li><b>Goals</b><br>Personas’ goals should be aligned with the goals and intentions behind marketing products and services. It is all about “What they want to accomplish? Why?” Discovering users’ emotions is a step that sits higher in the hierarchy of persona profile. Once you begin to see your clients from the perspective of a good friend, you get to witness the real value of your product, and why your services are their preferred choice.</li></ol>

<h2>Why do Personas fail?</h2>
<div><p>The profile of your ideal client is not going to be a perfect match with any of your existing customers. However, when people a product repeatedly, it becomes a second nature for the provider to expect, predict, and improve their business based on recurring customer behavior. When researching and building a persona, designers sometimes forget that this fictional profile must represent a real person. Customers are people with real lives and problems and are not easy to predict or put into a category. Shopping is only a single task on their busy schedule, and they probably don’t much obsess about your service. Human personality is a quirky matter and frequently defies straightforward answers or obvious answers derived from raw statistics.</p><p>Junior designers make one common mistake when creating a personal profile – they interview their friends and risk flooding their research data with the wrong set of information. Customer profiles benefit from accurate or unbiased information, which, in turn, helps designers believe in the problem they are trying to solve. When collecting data, it is much better to get more of it, than not enough. At the same time, wordy and irrelevant details are best excluded. They would only muddy-up the data and compromise its relevancy. Sifting through pieces of information has always been a tough challenge, even more so in Persona creation, because of the ever-present unpredictability of the human factor.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/blog/user-personas/user-personas-failed.jpg" alt="User Personas - Why do they fail?"></p>
<h2>Why do you need a Persona?</h2>
<div><p>By knowing the goals and frustrations of your users, it’s easier to understand them. View them as a network of features that define an individual, rather than the purpose of everyone in the network. Design a product that will satisfy that individual’s needs, and you have yourself a winning strategy featuring a persona model.</p><p>Persona works standalone, but usually, it is essential to create different groups of virtual people. These fake characters help designers build robust user-oriented features. A persona-related design can help experts predict what the customer would do or want next or help prevent problems before they occur.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/blog/user-personas/user-personas-problem.jpg" alt="User Personas - Solving a problem"></p>
<p>Successful Designer’s teams are the ones who can walk in the client’s shoes. They understand the problem from a more realistic perspective. What would your Persona think when you add a new feature to the app they use? What was the motivation behind the idea of this service or product? What issues and pain-points do they face? Smart design decisions featuring personas come as a result of getting the right answers to questions like these.</p>
<h2>What problems does a Persona solve?</h2>
<p>There are no disputes over whether a good UX comes easily. Designers need to understand the full spectrum of product cycle and value, business statistics, the tech used, and everything that has anything to do with the product. If you want to make successful products – get to know what your customer wants. Persona also represents a selective gathering of user’s behavior patterns, later used to match the expectations and motivations of customers.</p>

<div><p>View the flow of the users’ day better, how and when they interact. Do not focus on “How does this work?”.&nbsp; Creating a good UX is to design the best product for others and their goals. It helps teams make a smooth transition between requirements and design.</p><p>Thanks to the use of Personas, our team working on the <b><a href="https://codecoda.com/en/case-studies/case-study-metime-connecting-beauty-practicioners-with-clients-around-the-globe">MeTime</a></b> project managed to solve a lot of problems with it. MeTime is an application built to connect end-users with Clinics and Doctors all over the world. People using the app undergo a whole journey aimed to match their specific needs with the best possible provider able to handle them.</p><p>After the combined effect from in-depth research sessions and interviews with doctors and potential users, we shaped the MeTime app to become an easy to use tool for everyone involved. Our Doctor Persona was made to reflect on what customers wanted most – fast and reliable response and evaluation of their medical problem or request, and the …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ll have heard of Simon Sinek.&nbsp; He took the business world by storm in 2009 with his lecture, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en">‘How Great Leaders Inspire Action’</a>.&nbsp; This became the 3<sup>rd</sup> most-watched TED talk of all time.&nbsp; In it, he unveiled his ‘Golden Circle’ with ‘Why’ at its heart.&nbsp; His book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Start-Why-Leaders-Inspire-Everyone/dp/0241958229/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=54915772044&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAvc_xBRCYARIsAC5QT9kMs6fl_tHoNJWH1_5FVGK6ayPdF9A3pdNnBaoJWPMwZhHqbdLdVY0aAiC2EALw_wcB&amp;hvadid=259037696121&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=1007044&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=1751487360736231536&amp;hvtargid=aud-857384558340%3Akwd-296960221096&amp;hydadcr=18496_1817309&amp;keywords=start+with+why+by+simon+sinek&amp;qid=1580474176&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">‘Start with Why’</a> became a best-seller and his views were widely accepted by companies across the globe.&nbsp; An obsession with ‘Purpose’ began.</p>



<p>It is now a mainstream belief that <a href="https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/blog/why-businesses-with-purpose-grow-faster/">businesses with a strong idea of their core purpose</a> prosper.&nbsp; Other writers have developed this concept, such as <a href="https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/podcast/a-conversation-with-hiut-denim-co-ceo-david-hieatt/">David Hieatt in his book ‘Do Purpose – Why Brands with a Purpose Do Better and Matter More’.</a>&nbsp; This is a belief I share.  There’s no arguing with the importance of purpose.  As <a href="https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/about-dominic-monkhouse/">MD of two tech companies</a> that grew from zero to £30 million in just 5 years, I’ve seen with my own eyes the difference it can make to a business.</p>



<p>But where I disagree fundamentally with Sinek is his central message of ‘starting with why’.&nbsp; This isn’t where you should start at all.</p>



<h2><strong>What’s the thrust of Sinek’s message?</strong></h2>



<p>Sinek set out to discover why companies like Apple achieved such extraordinary success while others, with the same resources, failed.&nbsp; He found that less successful companies often started with ‘What’, then moved to ‘How’ and many neglected to even mention ‘Why’.  Some hadn’t the faintest clue why they did what they did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Sinek’s opinion, the reason Apple was so successful was it started with ‘Why’.&nbsp; This was at the core of Apple’s marketing (pardon the pun!) and the driving force behind its business operations.&nbsp; As a result, he says, Apple was able to attract customers who shared its fundamental beliefs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From this, he designed his ‘Golden Circle’ theory of building strategy.</p>

<p>All well and good, but I think there’s something missing here. Apple dominates the global handset market by capturing <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/apple-continues-lead-global-handset-industry-profit-share/">66% of industry profits and 32%</a> of the overall handset revenue.&nbsp; But crucially, they weren’t trying to sell a smartphone to everyone.&nbsp; They are targeting a tight group of customers for whom the Apple ecosystem is part of their self-worth and their projection to the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Steve Jobs returned and created the world-famous ‘Think Different’ campaign, Apple products were not the best. In fact, they were a bit shit.&nbsp; But Apple had identified a sub-set of people – creatives, misfits, dreamers – for whom owning a Mac said something about the sort of off-the-wall people they wanted to be. To my mind, this proves that you can’t have a ‘why’ unless you know ‘who’ your ‘why’ is going to appeal to.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Start with ‘Who’ not ‘Why’</strong></h2>



<p>Whilst the Golden Circle of ‘Why’, ‘How’ and ‘What’ is important, I think it’s missing something even more fundamental.&nbsp; A fourth circle – ‘Who’ – at the very centre.  This is where I believe you should start.</p>



<p>Surely your over-arching goal is to build a successful commercial enterprise?&nbsp; Well, I don’t think you can do this starting with ‘Why’.  Contrast Sinek’s view of strategy with that of Jim Collins – another great business author and speaker.&nbsp; His ‘Hedgehog Concept’ is something I refer to over and over again with my clients.  He believes that a successful strategy is formed from overlapping 1) What you are deeply passionate about (your ‘Why’) with 2) what you can be best at in the world and 3) what best drives your economic engine.&nbsp; It’s this third point that’s missing from Sinek’s viewpoint.  The commercial imperative that should drive every business.<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Cx5FchRgo-3Snm0OD1KjuGrClpCOD-06ZOpzwXwWeq9OY2rwZjotW0VHOM4q5zrzyyvHihLmUdxaCCz5KrCXCY1p8z0_qfvUy80TXtXHXUAMASWMxOA0VkAbcd2KAtkFTLly73Jw" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>Back in 1954, the sage-like grandfather of modern business, Peter Drucker, said, ‘There is only one valid definition of a business purpose: to create a customer’.&nbsp; I think this still holds true and yet many companies struggle to understand this fundamental concept.  There’s little point finding your meaning for existence and working out what you’re going to do, and how, if this doesn’t appeal to the right customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And yet this happens time and again.&nbsp; The CEO is on a mission but his company’s customers are leaving in droves.&nbsp; They don’t care.  Disaster can strike when there’s no clear idea about Core Customer.&nbsp; Take Chip Wilson, ex-CEO of Lululemon. His fat-shaming remarks about Lululemon’s yoga pants were a PR catastrophe for the company.&nbsp; He’d lost his grip on who his core customers were and, worse still, ended up insulting a good many of them.  The company has never truly recovered.</p>



<h2><strong>Finding your ‘Who’</strong></h2>



<p>Ultimately, you’re trying to create a tribe that love what you do and feel like they belong when they experience your company for the first time.&nbsp; I believe this should start with your staff.  <a href="https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/blog/want-better-productivity-then-prioritise-happiness/">First and foremost, do your employees feel like they’re in the right place?</a>  And then, do your existing customers feel happy they made the right choice by picking your company?&nbsp; Only after you’ve got these two elements right will you attract new customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a different way of approaching marketing.&nbsp; Too often, the focus is on attracting new people through the door and then, when they arrive, losing them because everything’s not quite in sync.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/blog/7-top-tips-for-successful-recruitment/">Don’t build a recruitment process that attracts the wrong people</a>.  They’ll leave after a few months because your company is different from the expectation you created.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To build a tribe of customers, you need to get laser-focused on who these people are. &nbsp; Your guiding principle should be, ‘Who are the customers that will buy from us at maximum profit?’ Most of the time, my clients don’t have this.&nbsp; Since they started trading, they’ve attracted a broad array of customers, all looking for different things. This makes it hard to narrow down to the Core Customer that will ultimately drive their growth.</p>



<p>When we get to the nitty-gritty of working out their Core Customer, I guide clients to focus first and foremost on the ones who buy at maximum profit.&nbsp; Perhaps these customers buy the fullest range of services or have the potential to do so. Then we narrow it down to one who best represents the customers they need to target. We give them a name.&nbsp; A recent example is ‘Andrew’.  Then we start to profile this customer archetype – what is Andrew trying to do in his business?  Does he have a transformational challenge? Maybe he’s an agent of change in his organisation?&nbsp; What insights tell his story?  What is his background?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then I get them to work out how Andrew is likely to buy – and where they fit in this buying journey.&nbsp; Finally, and most importantly, how do they want Andrew to feel when he signs on the dotted line?  This is why you need to start with ‘Who’ before working out your ‘Why’.&nbsp; Otherwise, you lose the connection between how you want them to feel when they do business with you and your purpose.  These need to interlock.</p>



<h2><strong>Creating a niche</strong></h2>

<p>A massive lightbulb moment is when clients realise they only need to attract a small number of these Core Customers, maybe 10 or 20, to double their business in the next three years.&nbsp; Brilliant! In the past, their strategy has been focused on average customers.  Now, they can tailor their entire approach to the needs of a specific group of Core Customers.</p>



<p>When I was at Peer 1 Hosting, we had 13,400 customers globally but only 500 of these were high value.&nbsp; I worked out we only needed another 100 net annually to achieve our growth plans of doubling in three years.&nbsp; So, we got really focused on who they were and what they needed from us.  This had far-reaching consequences – our core values and purpose were aligned around these needs. They guided every decision we made. We looked for staff who shared these values and could ensure our Core Customers knew, liked and trusted us.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/blog/why-you-need-nps-to-grow-your-business/">If you’re using NPS®</a> (Net Promoter Score), you need to make sure your score is higher for your Core Customer than any of your competitors. This is about being different.&nbsp; You’re not trying to be brilliant for every customer or the biggest or the best. You’ve identified attributes for your business that you know your Core Customer values and by delivering these, you’ll win.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is how you create a niche.&nbsp; By getting inside the heads of a small number of high-value customers, you’ll own this small segment. Eventually, you will become the number one supplier of your ‘Who’.&nbsp; It’s like mining for a rich vein of gold.  Think small, not big, and use a feelings model to get there.  This will be way more effective than constantly selling the features and benefits of your product.</p>



<hr>



<p>So, take my advice. Don’t ignore Simon Sinek entirely. BUT&nbsp;start with ‘Who’ not ‘Why’.  By doing this, you’ll find a profitable purpose that drives the economic engine of your business.&nbsp; After all, you’re not just doing this for love.  Profit is also important!</p>

<div>
<p>In 2017/18 cryptocurrencies went through a speculative bubble that saw its flagship currency Bitcoin reach peaks of $20,089 and a market cap of $320 billion. At the height of euphoria, the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies reached $790 billion. While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies (known as altcoins) have been around since 2009, it was the consolidation of mindshare and public interest in 2017 and 2018 that has made it a mainstay for alternative investors. But the fact remains that we are yet to see the adoption event that will make it a mainstay for all investors.</p>



<p>Most recently Cryptocurrencies have once again found a place in the news cycle following two years of dormancy post the bubble. The central trend appears to be around the phenomenon of decentralised finance otherwise known as DeFi. The quantity of activity and community participation in DeFi and related activities have been pointed to as potential indicators of a return to the speculative mania that took place in 2017. By the end of July, the total value locked up in DeFi related projects was $4 billion. A somewhat marginal amount given that Bitcoin is now over $200 billion in valuation and the whole market for cryptocurrencies is approaching $350 billion.</p>



<p>Regardless, DeFi represents a strong use case for cryptocurrencies as a means to provide lending and borrowing capabilities and is also geared to attract significant speculative interest. One of the most basic and pervasively engaged features of DeFi at present is yield farming. Cryptocurrency assets can earn or ‘farm’ yields in three main forms:</p>



<ol><li>Participating in financial products as one would in traditional markets</li><li>Locking up some cryptocurrency liquidity in return for an interest-like reward.</li><li>Staking cryptocurrency (like collateral) to fortify the security of a Proof-of-Stake based blockchain platform, where ‘staking’ some tokens prevents malicious activity similar to how a collateralized loan prevents default risk.</li></ol>



<p>However, the attention decentralised finance (DeFi) is getting right now, looks more like a bubble than a catalyst for adoption, where volatility (price, scams, hacks etc) of the industry hasn’t been solved.</p>



<p>The question then is, what is a catalyst for adoption? Given that financial products (form 1) on any platforms, blockchain or otherwise, can provide yields through participation, let us focus on yield farming native to the nature of blockchain (forms 2 &amp; 3), Proof-of-Stake – where providing security/liquidity returns yields.</p>



<p>Proof-of-Stake is simply the mechanism whereby a decentralised platform is able to provide security against attacks on the immutability of the ledger on the blockchain. The name holds the key to understanding this mechanism where ‘staking’ (locking up) the currency on the platform, is the means by which you are able to validate transactions on the ledger (the state of the blockchain) and add to the ledger. The game theory of securing the chain via staking is tied to rewards for being a good actor and penalties for being a bad actor. These rewards represent the yields earned for securing the chain.</p>



<p>What is particularly interesting as the speculation starts to ramp up once more is that Proof-of-Stake based platforms are gaining more attention because of their ability to provide yields in return for a financial stake in the platform. Yields on a Proof-of-Stake network represents a passive income avenue for a spectrum of individual/retail investors all the way to institutional players. This differs from the Proof-of-Work mechanism, most popularly represented by Bitcoin, which consumes electricity (mining) to secure the ledger. Where mining BTC is more difficult and less accessible to the spectrum of investors (currently there are a few large mining farms that make this their primary occupation) most BTC investors will make capital gain returns based on price appreciation through adoption. In the absence of BTC becoming a true global currency it will depend on a series of consolidating speculative bubbles to edge toward adoption – a chicken and egg problem perhaps sped along by the more consistent rewards associated with Proof-of-Stake.</p>



<h3>Yields: A Ponzi scheme or a catalyst for cryptocurrency adoption?</h3>



<p>Thus far the speculation on the future potential of blockchain technology, and cryptocurrencies by extension, is what gives the industry the large valuation it holds, even as use cases seem scarce or utilised by few.</p>



<p>In such a case, providing yields for no inherent value due to lack of use case, appears more like a Ponzi scheme than investment in a nascent technology. The idea is that when more people take a financial stake in the platform and lock up those funds for yields, all the prior participants will continue to benefit, not only from the yields but also from the price appreciation of the currency and market capitalisation of the platform. Of course, the integrity of the platform will only be realised when the use cases are actualised at some point in the future. In the interim, the Ponzi characteristics are exacerbated by the lucrative yield returns (often ranging from 5-20% per annum) made available by Proof-of-Stake networks, in comparison to traditionally available yield/interest earning financial products. It’s important to note that platforms vary in risk and reliability, we can liken it to investing in financial products across different tranches – some more junk-like than others.</p>



<p>Bitcoin, on the other hand, provides an entirely different avenue of investment in blockchain but comes with its own set of challenges – namely the chicken and egg problem we discussed above. Bitcoin requires the expense of electricity through mining activities to secure the network and ‘earn’ Bitcoin. While the rewards for mining on a Proof-of-Work network can be equated to the yields earned for staking on a Proof-of-Stake network, the ‘work’ performed for Proof-of-Work (cost of time and initial investment) makes it impossible for it to operate like a Ponzi scheme. Essentially, this means that Bitcoin can’t propagate its adoption through the mechanism of mining, where mining does not lend itself to the low-effort traits of Proof-of-Stake currently attracting attention to the DeFi bubble.</p>



<p>The lower effort in work required to secure the Proof-of-Stake network allows more users to participate meaningfully and earn yields. This is the beginning of a solution to the chicken and egg problem, where increased participation can bolster the market capitalisation required for widespread traction. In summary, easier participation increases the likelihood of network effect for a platform, where earning yields becomes the initial use case for the platform – as risky or unreliable as it may seem. Increased traction over time is very capable of evolving the volatile and Ponzi-like DeFi space into a mature financial structure supporting the blockchain ecosystem.</p>



<p>During 2017/18 the prevailing narrative of Proof-of-Work and crypto’s use case as a currency was not substantiated and resulted in a bubble rather than an adoption event. While it gained attention on the global stage, the widely held perception was that there was no immediately apparent use case that could sustain and grow its valuation beyond pure speculation. In the last couple of years following the bust of the speculative bubble, Proof-of-Stake has become a more significant narrative for the industry. The most marked indicator being Ethereum (currently Proof-of-Work), the second largest cryptocurrency, indicating its intent to transition to a Proof-of-Stake network.</p>



<p>The narrative of Proof-of-Stake is ballooning out quite rapidly, popularly considered to be propagated by the perceived benefits for scaling transaction capacity. However, what we have identified is that the use case of earning yields has the potential to catalyse the next boom cycle similar to 2017/ 18, and perhaps even to a greater extent. Even in the absence of yields as a catalyst for the next boom cycle, it represents a solid use case as a financial ecosystem to sustain speculative value and drive cryptocurrencies closer to mainstream use.</p>

                  <p>August 25, 2020<br></p>
                  
                  <p>Dear Colleagues,<br></p>
                  
                  <p>We would like to inform you about an upcoming major transition for the Journal of Field Robotics.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>After 15 years of service, John Wiley and Sons, the publisher has decided not to renew the <br></p>
                  <p>contract of the Editor in Chief (Sanjiv Singh) and the Managing Editor (Sanae Minick) and <br></p>
                  <p>hence our term will expire at the end of 2020.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>This comes after two years of discussions between new Wiley representatives and the <br></p>
                  <p>Editorial Board have failed to converge to a common set of principles and procedures by <br></p>
                  <p>which the journal should operate. The Editorial Board has unanimously decided to resign.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>We do want to assure the authors who have papers under review that we see it as our <br></p>
                  <p>responsibility to bring these documents to resolution during our term. We will continue to <br></p>
                  <p>process new submissions until the end of the year. More about the future at the end of this note.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>While the issue at the heart of our disagreement with Wiley is about academic independence, <br></p>
                  <p>it should be noted that there is a structural issue here. Scholarly publishing is broadly in flux <br></p>
                  <p>at the moment in the search for a sustainable model. Currently, academics are not paid to <br></p>
                  <p>create and review articles.&nbsp; In fact, they often have to pay fees to publish, and, readers have <br></p>
                  <p>to pay to access the work through a pay per view system, or, through subscriptions. <br></p>
                  <p><a title="https://www.coalition-s.org" href="https://www.coalition-s.org/">Plan S</a>, an international consortium makes the dilemma clear:<br></p>
                  
                  <p>"Monetising the access to new and existing research results is profoundly at odds <br></p>
                  <p>with the ethos of science (Merton, 1973 )… In the 21st century, science publishers <br></p>
                  <p>should provide a service to help researchers disseminate their results. They may <br></p>
                  <p>be paid fair value for the services they are providing, but no science should be locked <br></p>
                  <p>behind paywalls!"<br></p>
                  
                  <p>While this moment calls for creativity and collaboration with the scholarly community to find <br></p>
                  <p>new models, Wiley is intent on making broad changes to the way that the Journal of Field <br></p>
                  <p>Robotics is operated, guided mostly by an economic calculation to increase revenue and <br></p>
                  <p>decrease costs. To do this, they have unilaterally decided to change the terms of the <br></p>

<span><a href="https://0110.be/posts/Olaf_-_Acoustic_fingerprinting_on_the_ESP32_and_in_the_Browser">»</a> By <a href="https://0110.be/users/Joren">Joren</a> on Thursday 20 <a href="https://0110.be/date/2020/8">August 2020</a></span>
<p><img alt="Recognition of music." src="https://0110.be/files/attachments/475/web_embedded_olaf.jpg"> A good year ago I was asked to develop audio recognition technology for an e-costume. The idea was that <i>lights in the costume would follow a sequence synchronised to a certain song</i>. Only a single song should trigger the lights, all other music should be ignored. Recognition of music and synchronisation is typically done using audio fingerprinting techniques. The challenge was that the recognition needed to run on a cheap, battery-powered microcontroller with limited <span>CPU</span> and memory. I delivered a prototype but eventually a cheap, battle-tested, off-the-shelf, IP-cleared, alternative was found.</p>
<p>The prototype gathered dust for a while but the idea stuck in my head. With my daughters fourth birthday approaching during the lockdown, I decided to turn the prototype into an over-engineered birthday gift and let an ‘Elsa-dress’ react to ‘Let It Go’ from the Frozen soundtrack. With the prototype as a starting point, I ordered an <span>RGB</span>-<span>LED</span>-strip, a beefy Li-Ion Battery, an I2S digital microphone and, of course, an Elsa-dress.</p>
<p>I had an ESP32 microcontroller laying around and used it as the core of the system: it supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2S">I²S</a>, has a floating point unit (<span>FPU</span>), is easy to use together with <span>LED</span> strips and has enough memory. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_unit"><span>FPU</span></a> makes it straightforward to use the same code on traditional computers as on embedded devices: fixed-point math can be avoided.</p>
<p>After soldering the components together and with the help from my better half to sew in the <span>LED</span> strip, it all came together. In the video below, the result of our work can be seen. The video first shows a song that should not and is not recognised. Then, “Let It Go” is played and correctly recognised. After the song is stopped, the lights go on for a while and finally stop: this is by design to allow gaps in recognition. Lastly, the song is continued and again correctly recognised.</p>

</video>
</center>
<p>With my limited C experience the prototype code was not well organised. During my second attempt this improved enough so that I feel comfortable enough to share the code on GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/JorenSix/Olaf">Olaf – Overly Lightweight Acoustic Fingerprinting</a>. The code went through several iterations and was expanded beyond the original scope and became <b>a capable general purpose acoustic fingerprinting system</b> with its <a href="https://0110.be/publications/Applications_of_Duplicate_Detection_in_Music_Archives%3A_from_Metadata_Comparison_to_Storage_Optimisation">many applications</a>. Olaf performs quite well thanks to its resource friendly design and the use of <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jpommier/pffft/src/master/"><span>PFFT</span></a> and <a href="http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/"><span>LMDB</span></a>. Especially <span>LMDB</span>, a fast, B+-tree backed key value store with low storage overhead enables performant storage and lookups.</p>
<h3><span>WASM</span>: Olaf in the browser</h3>
<p>Olaf, being written in <span>ANSI</span> C, can run in the browser thanks to the <a href="https://emscripten.org/">Emscripten</a> compiler. According to its website, Emscripten <i>‘…lets you run C and C++ on the web at near-native speed without plugins’</i> Combining the Web Audio <span>API</span> and the <span>WASM</span> version of Olaf makes web-based acoustic fingerprinting applications possible.</p>
<p>Below you can try out Olaf. The <i>exact same code</i> is running on your browser as on the ESP32 demonstrated above. This means that Olaf is listening to recognise ‘Let It Go’ from the Frozen soundtrack. For your convenience the song can be started below on the left. On the right, you can start Olaf by allowing incoming audio to be analysed. The <span>FFT</span> is calculated by Olaf and visualised using <a href="https://www.pixijs.com/">Pixi.js</a>. After a few seconds the red fingerprints should become green, indicating a match. Once you stop the song, the fingerprints will eventually turn red again. As with the video above: going from a match to no match takes a couple of seconds to allow gaps in recognition.</p>

<p><small>1. Start the song and play it aloud. Singing along is encouraged.</small>
<small>2. Start the microphone and check whether recognition succeeds.</small>

      The personal website is a somewhat mysterious animal that 
      lives mostly unobserved in the jungle of the Internet.  A few 
      inexperienced Internet users who live completely within the 
      golden-walled gardens of Facebook and Google may not even be 
      aware of the species' existence.  Other inexperienced users 
      may consider the personal website to be either extinct, like 
      brontosaurus, or a myth, like 
      <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/why-bigfoot-and-abominable-snowman-loom-large-human-imagination-180975365/">Bigfoot 
      or the Abominable Snowman</a>.  The truth is that many 
      specimens exist in the wild, but in order to successfully 
      hunt the personal website, a hunter must know the habits of 
      this species well.</p>

   <p>Please allow me to be your guide on this safari through the murky 
      and predator-filled Internet jungle, and I will lead you to 
      some representative specimens of the personal website species and 
      teach you hunting methods that are likely to lead you to others.</p>

   <p>As legend has it, during a more peaceful time, soon after the 
      genesis of the Internet jungle and before the mid 1990's, personal 
      websites were the predominant species.  But queen Sophia the 
      demiurge, wife of King Berners-Lee, at the pleading of her daughter 
      Pandora, acquiesced to provide a breeding ground for Pandora's 
      pets.  Over time, more and more pets were allowed to roam free in 
      the jungle, including not a few predators.  Eventually, these 
      pets became the predominant species of the Internet jungle and 
      personal websites became nearly invisible among all the bellowing 
      and commotion raised by Pandora's pets.  This near invisibility made 
      personal websites very difficult to hunt.</p>

   <p>Before discussing personal websites in detail, I should first 
      mention two common predators in the Internet jungle.  The 
      corporate predator induces the Internet user to willingly approach 
      him by pretending to be a harmless domesticated animal, much like 
      a horse or a cow.  Note that not all corporate websites are 
      predators, though a large number of them do have certain 
      similarities to cows, ponderousness often being one.  But, many 
      corporate websites are not nearly as domesticated as they appear.  
      Just read the details of their terms-of-service agreements if you 
      doubt this.  As with many humans and their cats, the truth is 
      that deciding in any given instance whether a corporate website 
      or its Internet user is the dominant species can be a difficult 
      task.</p>

   <p>A less well understood animal is the hacker.  Hacker is a genus 
      containing a number of species.  Some are predatory, and others 
      are harmless or even beneficial to the ecology of the Internet 
      jungle.  By far, the most populous species of predatory hacker is 
      the "script kiddie".  Script kiddies tend to be blind, feeling 
      their way around the Internet jungle from IP address to IP 
      address.  Their goal seems to be to find those websites that have 
      ingested corporate website code that has made them susceptible to 
      infection.  When a script kiddie finds such a website, it 
      frequently injects malware, which it sometimes uses to help it find 
      and attack other websites.</p>

   <p>The reason for the script kiddie's behavior remains a mystery, 
      since it usually provides little nourishment.  Some script kiddie 
      observers speculate that script kiddies engage in the noted 
      behavior simply to impress others of their species.  While other 
      animals must impress potential mates in order to improve the 
      genetics of their offspring, most potential mates of script kiddies 
      seem unimpressed by their behavior.  A possibility also exists that 
      the script kiddie's behavior serves primarily as a means of 
      determining pecking order, primarily among males of the species.  
      However, one observation that tends to bolster the mating theory is 
      that most script kiddies that have successfully mated no longer 
      engage in their typical behavior.</p>
  
   <p>Even many moderately experienced hunters fear the personal 
      website, because they have been led to believe that personal 
      websites frequently carry diseases--viruses in particular, or 
      parasites generally known as "malware".  Though both of these are 
      possible, they are uncommon.  The truth is that personal websites 
      practice habits that are generally no less cleanly than other 
      Internet jungle species.  However, some of the less wary personal 
      websites do become susceptible to viruses and malware by ingesting 
      code defecated by corporate websites, including code from the unusually 
      flatulent and dyspeptic Microshaft.  Nevertheless, hunters' fear of 
      personal websites is largely overblown. 
      <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/no-such-thing-as-secure.html">Well-equipped</a>
      hunters have little to fear.</p>

   <p>Unlike most other animals that must constantly evade predators 
      to survive, the personal website has few known enemies.  The 
      personal website is, however, susceptible to the DMCA parasite, 
      which is capable of suing it to death.  Fortunately, this is a rare 
      occurrence, perhaps mainly due to the near invisibility of the 
      personal website.  For this reason, and because personal websites 
      are almost always so small that they have very little meat on them 
      (otherwise known as posts or articles), they are rarely in 
      danger from predators.  Personal websites also tend to 
      taste bad to the larger corporate predators, as they rarely 
      advertise or produce much of an income.  Very rarely, however, a 
      well-fed personal website may grow to a large enough size 
      to successfully compete with corporate websites for the food provided 
      by users.  When this occurs, some observers fear this fat 
      personal website may be in danger of being killed (see 
      <a href="https://johnfowler.co/facebook-blocked-my-website/">here</a>, 
      <a href="https://heavy.com/news/2018/10/facebook-purge-list-deleted-accounts/">here</a>, 
      <a href="https://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-strategy/3-ways-facebook-is-killing-your-website/">here</a>, 
      and <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/why-does-google-steal-content-from-honest-businesses-us-congressman-2271102">here</a>), 
      but few corporate predators ingest even the fattest personal 
      websites, perhaps because they simply do not know what to do with 
      them.  On rare occasions, however, corporate predators will capture 
      both personal and non-revenue-generating corporate websites and 
      allow them to live for a few more years while dying 
      <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/healthcare-and-life-sciences/skype-for-business-online-end-of-life-july-31-2021/ba-p/779137">slow 
      deaths from starvation</a>.</p>

   <p>Unlike other animals that are seen or heard mainly at mating time, 
      personal websites do not reveal their presence in this manner, 
      because they do not mate.  Instead, they reproduce asexually.  Some 
      produce offspring by budding, a plantlike characteristic.  Many, if 
      not most, also exhibit another plantlike characteristic.  They 
      sprinkle their spoors (technically, known as hyperlinks) over the 
      floor of the Internet jungle in the hope of being one day chanced 
      upon by an Internet user and ingested.  Though ingestion rarely 
      occurs, when it does, through some process not well understood by 
      present-day science, the Internet user is occasionally induced to 
      create his own personal website.  This website is then free to bud 
      under the careful attention and care of the host Internet user, who 
      has now been transformed into an entity sometimes known as a 
      "developer", though developer is not an especially well-defined 
      designator.  At the proper time, the new website naturally begins 
      to produce its own spoors, and its life cycle repeats.</p>

   <p>Sometimes, spoors and bits of code are exchanged directly with other 
      personal websites, in a manner analogous to bacterial conjugation, 
      in which genetic material, called plasmids, are exchanged between 
      bacteria.  This type of spoor is known as a "backlink".  Sometimes, 
      websites collect backlinks and place them in groups called 
      blogrolls.</p>

   <p>As alluded to previously, the main reason personal websites are so 
      difficult to find in the Internet jungle is that they are almost 
      completely invisible to the bloodhounds of the Internet, known
      as "search engines".  Search engines use search algorithms, 
      rather than smell, to find websites.  Except on rare occasions, the 
      only search in which a personal website appears on <i>any page</i> 
      of a search result is a search that includes the personal website's 
      exact domain name (its location in the Internet jungle) 
      or the exact title of one its articles.  
      Therefore, less than a hundred of the most popular personal websites 
      can be found through the overwhelming majority of Internet 
      searches.  Though this may be hard to believe, it is true.</p>

   <p>Even the smaller search engines like millionshort.com, 
      swisscows.com, and wiby.me are largely blind to any personal 
      websites other than the top 100.  Internet zoologists speculate 
      that smaller search engines are not actually blind to personal 
      websites.  They only pretend to be blind by keeping their eyes 
      tightly closed whenever they encounter a personal website, so as to 
      imitate their leader, the Google search engine, which is truly blind 
      to all but the top 100 or so personal websites.</p>

   <p>Due to the lack of attention that personal websites receive, they 
      often congregate together, or at least maintain an association with 
      others of their kind.  They do this for survival.  You see, personal 
      websites need some amount of attention to survive.  If they cannot 
      get attention from Internet users, they try to get it from each 
      other.  This is the primary behavior by which an experienced hunter 
      may successfully track them.</p>

   <p>When by the greatest stroke of luck, a hunter happens to stumble 
      upon a nearly-invisible personal website, he should immediately look 
      for others …</p></div></div>

<h4>Intro</h4>
<p>Some time ago, I wrote a post about <a href="https://retrohax.net/beeb-errr-bbc-micro-restoration-and-upgrades/">BBC Micro restoration and upgrades.</a> This time, I present you a BBC Master – Beebs bigger brother 🙂</p>
<p>I’ve bought this BBC Master some time ago. It was sitting on a shelf for quite a while but finally, I’ve managed to start working on it. This time again, it was a custom order for my friend Wendell (cheers mate:)</p>
<p>Do I have to mention that it was sold as “For parts – non-working” ? :&gt;</p>
<p>Well, as it turned out, it wasn’t in a dramatic shape but required refreshing and upgrades.</p>
<p>Here is how it looked.</p>

<p>Case fixes were easy. I only had to fix a broken screw stud and fix some cracks with metal mesh and soldering iron.</p>
<p>Later, it was cleaned and retr0brighted. Simple stuff.</p>

<h4>Power supply fix and hack</h4>
<p>Before powering it on, I wanted to make sure that PSU is working properly. PSUs in Beeb and Master use caps that tend to explode and are worth checking before supplying power to it. My unit confirmed that. I had to replace these caps which was an easy job.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/1u0gIIQ.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/1u0gIIQ.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>

<p>Wendell asked me to try making this unit usable in the US and in the EU. This simply means that PSU has to be a bit more flexible and should accept 110VAC/60HZ (USA) and 230VAC/50Hz (EU)</p>
<p>I was very lucky because this BBC had a San Hua Tien PSU inside and it turned out that it supports both working modes depending on a jumper setting.</p>

<p>I’ve simply added some wires and a switch. I only had to make a nice hole in PSUs metal case and I was golden 🙂</p>

<h4>Keyboard</h4>
<p>In the meantime, I’ve managed to clean up a keyboard. </p>

<h4>PCB cleaning and speaker fix</h4>
<p>Next, I’ve moved to PCB cleaning. As usual, I’ve dumped it into my ultrasonic cleaner to get rid of these nasty white crystalline structures. I’ve also replaced a broken speaker with the 8 Ohm speaker that I’ve found in one of my drawers 🙂</p>

<h4>Batter mod</h4>
<p>Finally, I could power it on and test if everything works … NOT</p>

<p>With the help of guys from an excellent <a href="http://stardot.org.uk/">stardot.org.uk</a> forum, I’ve managed to pinpoint a problem. It turned out that this is a common issue with BBC Master, and my unit was simply missing a battery. Looks like the previous owner removed it to prevent leakage and corrosion.</p>
<p>I’ve ordered a 3xAA battery case from <a href="http://www.retroclinic.com/">Mark of RetroClinic</a> and it worked like a charm. It has a diode soldered in-line to prevent batteries from charging. The downside is that batteries have to be replaced from time to time but still, this is a way better solution than the original one.</p>

<h4>RPI Zero as a co-pro</h4>
<p>While looking for a solution to my previous battery problem on <a href="https://stardot.org.uk/forums/">stardot forums</a>, I’ve stumbled across the same mod as in <a href="https://retrohax.net/beeb-errr-bbc-micro-restoration-and-upgrades/">BBC Micro post</a> – Rpi Zero as a co-pro. This time it is an internal mod and again, it is made by <a href="http://www.retroclinic.com/">Mark of retroclinic.com</a>.</p>
<p>He’d send it to me along with a battery tray and one more cool gear that I will talk about later 😉</p>
<p>It is mounted straight onto a BBC Masters PCB.</p>

</p></figure>
<h4>External GOTEK</h4>
<p>The last add-on that I’ve got from Mark was a GOTEK with an OLED, all needed gear and a filled USB flash drive for it.</p>
<p>It is a very convenient solution for BBC Master and as expected, works like a charm 🙂</p>

<p>Here it is, a fully restored BBC Master. I hope Wendell likes it 😉</p>

  <article>
    <p>I’m back from cryosleep. After <a href="https://www.eidel.io/2020/01/31/pioneers-vs-process-people/">leaving Merantix Healthcare</a> 7 months ago I haven’t
been writing much. I took the summer off to finish my pilot’s license and to try out a few things on the
side.</p>

<p>One of them was doing regulatory consulting for medical software startups. Remember: At Merantix Healthcare
(now: Vara), we managed to pass all regulatory hurdles to bring our Machine Learning - based Radiology
software to market. At the time I thought this was quite an unspectacular achievement, but apparently many
other companies fail at it.</p>

<p>So, shortly after becoming unemployed, random people started emailing me with requests like “Hey, work as a
consultant for us, we pay you money, start tomorrow”. I started calling it the <em>magical consulting business
with zero marketing</em>.</p>

<p>It’s not like I was keen to do it, but it was worth a try.</p>

<p>I approached it with an open mind. Half a year later, after having succesfully worked with four companies,
here’s my verdict: It sucks.</p>

<p>Why? Many reasons. But let’s take a step back first.</p>

<p>What is regulation? (Bear with me) in human language, <em>regulation</em> is a list of hoops some authority puts in
your way of accessing the market. Everyone in your industry has to jump through these hoops.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing: In a sane world, with rational people, we wouldn’t need any regulation. People would be
building perfectly safe software. Like, they wouldn’t write buggy code that crashes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25" target="_blank">shoots high doses of
radiation at patients</a>.</p>

<p>Having perfect software is a utopic scenario. Software is never perfect. And even if most people build safe
stuff most of the time, just a small group of reckless individuals is enough to cause disaster.</p>

<p>That’s where regulation comes in. Regulation basically says: “Hey, this one company screwed up big time
recently, so from now on, every company has to comply with this list of things we came up with. Those measures
will surely prevent that from happening again!”.</p>

<p>And that sucks. Because what did we do? We took the maximum observed stupidity of our society (writing buggy
code that emits radiation) and now we <em>assume</em> that 1) everyone else is just as stupid and 2) that some rules
we came up with will prevent the problem in the future.</p>

<p>Let’s think about these assumptions.</p>

<h3 id="1-can-we-assume-everyone-to-be-stupid">1) Can We Assume Everyone to Be Stupid?</h3>

<p>Does it really sound like a good approach to subject everyone to the same standards? Standards which were
created based on the most incapable person, the <em>most-stupid-denominator</em>?</p>

<p>This reminds me of working at the office (good times). In any company, there are always some people who are
more messy than others. Or should we rather say: Less diligent. While you’re trying to write code, they have
loud phone calls on speakerphone. They enter your meeting room and don’t close the door. Sometimes they
“forget” to use the toilet brush after deploying a large payload.</p>

<p>Now, how do you deal with these problems? You have two options:</p>

<p>You talk to those people individually. This is not only the most discreet, but also the most effective
way. It’s also the hardest. At least for you: It takes courage to approach that person and deliver that sort
of message. But it’s the right thing to do.</p>

<p>The other option would be: You attempt to <em>generalize</em> the problem and solve it <em>generically</em> by establishing
new company policies. You put up a sign in the open office saying “No loud phones calls!”. On all meeting room
doors, you write “Please close the door”. And in each bathroom, you hang up a framed SOP for when to use the
toilet brush.</p>

<p>This is how large companies deal with those problems, and companies in which people don’t have the guts to
talk about problems one on one. It’s a cowardly and ineffective move. Guess what - the dude who has loud phone
calls will most likely not read a random sign on the wall. And all other people who were behaving perfectly
fine are now subjected to a barrage of useless signs which assume they’re utterly incompetent at breathing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, regulation tries to solve problems in the same way.</p>

<p>Developers are expected to create hundreds of pages of documentation to prove that they’ve really tested
everything. They must write a development plan to ensure that they’re actually capable of developing whatever
they wanted to build (?). They have to make a list of their dependencies and test them (!).</p>

<p>If your development team is incompetent, forcing them to write a development plan won’t increase their code
quality. It only increases overhead.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, the same incompetent developers will pass all regulatory hurdles as long as they’re creating
the right documentation. A scary thought. Which leads me to the next question:</p>

<h3 id="2-will-our-rules-prevent-the-problem">2) Will Our Rules Prevent the Problem?</h3>

<p>Anyone who has ever observed complex systems knows: It’s hard to come up with interventions which actually
provide the desired outcome.</p>

<p>Say, your garden has snakes. You don’t like that because you want to sit on your patio and you’re scared of
snakes. So you put a honey badger there to chase away the snakes. Great, the snakes are gone. But now the
honey badger is settling down on your patio and has invited all his honey badger friends to hang out
there. Bad luck for you. A second order effect!</p>

<p>Is developing (medical) software a complex process? And, if so, can regulation be compared to a honey badger?
I think so.</p>

<p>We are introducing measures which we <em>assume</em> will improve things, because they were <em>associated</em> with certain
problems in the past. But in reality we don’t know if they were <em>causing</em> them. We just mixed up correlation
and causation.</p>

<p>It’s like observing people with Covid and saying “Aha! Those Covid patients are coughing! So let’s tell all
healthy people not to cough and they’ll be fine!”. Luckily our standards of medical science are better than
that. New treatments have to undergo clinical trials in which they must show an improvement in patient
outcome. Do our regulatory measures undergo similar testing? I’m not sure.</p>

<p>But one things <em>will</em> happen for sure: The list of hoops all future companies have to jump through just became
longer. And guess what? The useful time they can spend on developing their product has shrunk, again.</p>

<p>But here’s the worst part. After we’ve introduced our measures, software actually became safer. That leads us
to wrongly assume that <em>we chose the right measures</em> and <em>those measures caused improvements in safety</em>. But I
don’t think that’s true. Sure, we achieved our goal, but we don’t know <em>how</em>. Sounds like alchemy! A dangerous
situation.</p>

<p>I call these <em>second order effects of regulation</em>.</p>

<h2 id="second-order-effects">Second Order Effects?</h2>

<p>Do our regulatory measures <em>cause</em> us to develop safer software? Or are we kicking off second-order effects
and just accomplishing our goals by coincidence?</p>

<p>Let’s look at the facts.</p>

<p>Building medical software has tons of additional overhead. This leads to slower development, additional hires
and more audits. What do companies need when development slows down, head count increases and auditors knock
on your door? Right - more money.</p>

<p>We’re severely limiting the number of companies who can enter the market by raising the bar of funding
required.</p>

<p>What are the consequences?</p>

<p>Only companies with a lot of funding (and time) are able to enter the market. A two-person startup can’t
afford to hire expensive staff for regulatory compliance. And they sure as hell can’t afford to put countless
man-hours into documenting regulatory-compliant processes! What sort of processes do you need in a two-person
startup, anyway?</p>

<p>So: We’ve successfully prevented small startups from entering the market.</p>

<p>What’s the main difference between small startups and large companies? Small startups develop products which
solve existing problems in a novel way. They accomplish this through innovation which others deemed
infeasible, or too <em>risky</em>, or both.</p>

<p><em>Risky</em>. That’s the difference.</p>

<p>GE, Philips, Siemens - do you expect those enterprises to ship a <em>risky</em>, groundbreaking Machine Learning -
based Radiology software which radically automates radiology assessments? Hell no. You can hardly expect them
to ship any features at all. They’re too scared of changing things. They’re scared of things going wrong,
their public image taking a hit and losing their existing customers. They are <em>risk-averse</em>.</p>

<p>So, yes, our medical software has become safer, but not due to our regulatory requirements. Rather because
we’ve created a heavy selection bias of only allowing large, well-funded, risk-averse companies to enter the
market.</p>

<p>We achieved safety at the cost of killing innovation. Flying an airplane, we would say: Great landing, wrong
airport.</p>

<h2 id="a-decision-we-have-to-make">A Decision We Have to Make</h2>

<p>Nowadays, the daring two-person startup can no longer enter the market and reach patients. That’s where
innovation would have happened.</p>

<p>Is that a bad thing? Well, it depends.</p>

<p>Safety and progress are often on opposing ends of a spectrum - in most cases, you can’t have both. We, as a
society, have chosen to heavily favor safety over progress. Better keep things the way they are, because new
things can go wrong. And that’s a fair decision to make.</p>

<p>But I think we’re making the wrong decision. Because most of us are blind to the opportunity cost of <em>not
innovating</em>. We don’t see what would have happened to patients if we had had better software.</p>

<p>While I was working in the hospital, I would regularly be involved in admitting new patients. You won’t
believe how often they didn’t have an up-to-date list of their medication. I’d have to call their GP and
request their medication list to be <em>faxed</em>, if I could reach the GP at all. This process was slow and
error-prone.</p>

<p>Consider: If you’re hit by a car and wheeled into the ER, do you want your medication list to be unavailable
because your GP is unreachable? Do you want your patient history to be lost because it’s on paper, stashed
away in some drawer? Do you want to be exposed to additional radiation for imaging because your old images
are on a CD at your parents place?</p>

<p>Just how many …</p></article></div></div>

<p>
  <b>tiny-curl is curl for smaller systems</b>.
  </p><ul>
    <li> focused on providing a library for HTTP(S) GET
    </li><li> provides the familiar and known libcurl API
    </li><li> targets RTOSes and systems "too small to run regular Linux"
    </li><li> provides ports to RTOSes that "real curl" don't support
    </li><li> GPLv3 licensed
  </li></ul>
<p>
  All features that tiny-curl disables by default are possible to enable,
  piecemeal, but might increase footprint and memory requirements.
</p><p>
  As many as possible of the mechanisms that are done to shrink the footprint
  for tiny-curl are backported and merged into real curl.
</p><h2> Size requirements </h2>
<p>
  The goal of tiny-curl is to offer HTTPS GET powers within <b>100K of storage
  size</b> (on a 32 bit system), and that includes wolfSSL.
</p><p>
  tiny-curl itself requires about <b>20K of dynamic memory</b> (but using more
  may speed up transfers).
</p><h2> License </h2>
<p>
  tiny-curl is licensed under GPLv3. Note that this is different than the
  regular curl, which is MIT licensed.
</p><p>
  You can also get <a href="https://www.wolfssl.com/contact/">tiny-curl under
  a commercial license from wolfSSL</a>.

    </span></p><p><undefined>Here are a few examples. The most irritating ones used tech jargon ("fixing bloat") to mask their pathetic actions. As a bystander, you might not realize until viewing the proposed changes... and seeing all content deleted. This is also the most irritating because there is no obviously hateful or violent content, and can be written off as "just a joke." <span role="img" aria-label="face with rolling eyes">🙄</span></undefined></p><p>This is a specific type of trolling I was experiencing, called "dogpiling":</p><blockquote><p>Dogpiling: When a group of trolls works together to overwhelm a target through a barrage of disingenuous questions, threats, slurs, insults, and other tactics meant to shame, silence, discredit, or drive a target offline. — <a href="https://onlineharassmentfieldmanual.pen.org/defining-online-harassment-a-glossary-of-terms/">PEN America</a></p></blockquote><p>This is not a new tactic used to silence, but it was the first time I've personally experienced it. Good thing I designed a lot of our moderation tools and have talked about the <a href="https://youtu.be/5CSQYMOWOtQ?t=580">taxonomy of online abuse</a> before, and recognized this type of harassment quickly. I was able to get help from amazing coworkers, <a href="https://twitter.com/cheshire137">Sarah Vessels</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/deniseyu21">Denise Yu</a>, to query my repo's referral data. The traffic was coming from 4chan... two 4chan threads totaling nearly 500 disturbing comments.</p><p>Seeing this shit was absolutely surreal. The GitHub content was annoying, but this made me feel sick. I still remember the feeling of being so overwhelmed and just sobbing at my desk. Reading disgusting, racist, sexist comments about me. Seeing screenshots of my face plastered across the threads. Understanding the exact moment where the dogpiling was coordinated. Realizing this was likely to keep happening (and it did).</p><p>And what still really creeps me out is that these people felt so emboldened to troll an EMPLOYEE using their actual GitHub accounts with legitimate work and contributions. <u>These harassers are everyday software engineers.</u></p><p>I'm not famous and I don't have a very large platform, so why me?</p><p>Upon reading the threads, there were some pretty clear reasons why this happened to me. I'll dig deeply into each one. <em>HUGE shoutout to my kat-ops counterpart <a href="https://twitter.com/pifafu">Kathy Zheng</a> for helping me compile screenshots!</em></p><h2>I'm a woman.</h2><p><undefined>Well, this was the most obvious reason. Women disproportionately experience online harassment, and very much so for sexual harassment. I included a few snippets but won't spend too much time on this one because it was some boring, basic bitch shit that we've all seen before <span role="img" aria-label="">🤷🏻‍♀️</span></undefined></p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>I'd like to point out that the idea of avoiding "diversity hires" as to not lower the bar of quality is still a prevalent sentiment within tech. Again, these are not just nameless 4chan trolls—they're people in our industry.</p><h2>... and should be punished.</h2><p>Yeah, these are gross. Apparently I should get fired and deserve the harassment because I'm an attention seeking whore on a programming platform!

    </span></p><p>That wasn't every screenshot from the threads, but is a good summary. The sheer volume of comments was definitely one of the more overwhelming aspects of this fuckery. Thanks for reading along this far.</p><h2>So if it wasn't clear:</h2><p><undefined>I was targeted by racist techies because of my background and visibility in order to be silenced and driven out of this industry. <span role="img" aria-label="middle finger">🖕</span></undefined></p><p>It was particularly cruel to harass me on the platform I work on everyday, where I design for open source communities. I couldn't focus at work and ended up taking two weeks off. This experience has really impacted the way I view tech and my place in it—but I'll save that for another post. </p><p>I've already accepted that this won't be my last brush with online harassment, so long as I'm still a visible Asian woman in tech. And this is going to continue happening to me and less privileged tech workers for just existing and being successful. All we can do is protect and support each other, because it's not our job to fix this problem.</p><p>It's your move next, tech. Here are my suggestions, you can have them for free:  </p><h2>To the most privileged tech leaders:</h2><p>When these events happen to your employees, are you investing actual money to support them? Are you monitoring content, encouraging time off, creating company policies, and covering their therapy? In lucky cases like mine, where the bulk of harassment may happen on the platform the victim works on, are you actively fixing pain points your employee experienced? Make sure you have a policy and detailed playbook, and definitely don't expect your marginalized employees to fix these problems for you. Don't wait until an incident arises—<strong>it's always an "edge case" until someone's personal safety is threatened.</strong></p><p>By not having intentional protections for the most vulnerable in place, you're preventing employees from being productive at work (because they're dealing with bullshit!). And you're absolutely driving away diverse talent from joining your company. It's actually fucking up your business. Access and representation in tech isn't a pipeline or qualification problem. <strong>It's a white supremacy problem.</strong></p><blockquote><p>And what still really creeps me out is that these people felt so emboldened to troll an EMPLOYEE using their actual GitHub accounts with legitimate work and contributions. <u>These harassers are everyday software engineers.</u></p></blockquote><p>Lastly, I want to circle back to this point about users with legitimate coding work harassing me. It's easy to dismiss these trolls as incel 4channers that we shun and don't associate with. Lol no. These are your people. They work at your companies and write your code. They are harassing or doxxing your other employees. This toxic behavior is still very much a part of your tech culture, and you keep rewarding it.</p><p>Fix. This. Shit.</p></article></div>]]>

<p>We like experimenting with geeky tools. All in the name of science of course…</p>



<p>How about sitting on a beach in Thailand and participating in conference in Stockholm by remote-controlling an ipad on a stick on wheels? Sounds like a fun experiment, doesn’t it? How many geek points is that?</p>



<figure><img src="https://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/henriks-double2.jpg?w=390&amp;h=520" alt="Image" title="Ipad on a stick on wheels"></figure>



<p>And hey, I just happen to be on an island in Thailand right now, and there’s this cool event&nbsp;<a href="http://leantribe.org/ltg-18/">Lean Tribe Gathering</a>&nbsp;happening at the Spotify Stockholm office, and I recently bought a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.doublerobotics.com/">double</a>. I saw one of those things driving around the office a few months ago, and it instantly popped to the top of my must-try-someday list.</p>



<p>So what was the hypothesis? I’ve heard that it’s only an experiment if you have a hypothesis. Otherwise it’s just playing around, and I wouldn’t want to be accused of that would I?</p>



<p>The conference was an evening of lightning talks and open space (= big room with lots of mingling and small groups of informal conversations, like a cocktail party under the guise of a conference). Will I hear and see the presentations? Will I be able to roll around and freely participate in the open space? Will I feel like I’m&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;<em>there</em>?</p>



<p>So my hypothesis was: “I can fully participate in this conference using a double”.</p>



<p>So how did it work out?</p>



<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/hkniberg.wordpress.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" title="More..."></figure>



<p>It worked! The hypothesis was falsified, unfortunately, but it was still really cool! I sat on the beach near a restaurant with good connectivity, pulled out my ipad, logged on to my double in Stockholm, and started driving around and talking to people. Geek heaven!<img loading="lazy" src="https://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/on-the-beach2.jpg?w=650&amp;h=414" alt="Image" width="650" height="414">Alone on a dark beach because it got rather late. +6 hrs time difference.</p>



<p>I was totally impressed, but also slightly disappointed, at the same time. Impressed that I felt truly present at the conference, but slightly disappointed that I felt more like an observer &amp; comic relief than a real participant.</p>



<p><strong>Watching the lightning talks</strong></p>



<p>The controls were a bit clumsy, and my internet connection was a bit shaky. But I could get around fine, slowly, and I was able to make it to the front of the room right by the stage.</p>



<p>For the lightning talks I could see and hear the speakers fine (they had mics), and I could make out about half of the slides (depending on colors used, font size, etc). All in all I got the presenter’s message. But I didn’t need a double for that, someone could have put a laptop on a chair and connected me via skype/hangout. On the other hand, it was nice to be able to “turn my head” from time to time, to follow the speaker’s movements, or see the audience and the room.</p>



<p><strong>Mingling in the open space</strong></p>



<p>The open space part was really fascinating. Driving around this… thing…. and feeling like I’m really there. Weird.</p>



<p>However, although it was fun and cool, in practice it didn’t really work that well because of the background chatter. I could roll up to a group of people, but I could only pick out about 20% of what was being said, because of all the other discussion happening around me. Also, the ipad speakers are too weak for this kind of situation, people could only hear me speak if they bent down and put their head really close. So I felt more like an observer than a participant.</p>



<figure><a href="http://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/my-ipad.jpg"><img src="https://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/my-ipad.jpg?w=468&amp;h=611" alt="Image"></a></figure>



<p>At one point I joined a smaller group (4 people) sitting a bit further off, away from the main chatter.&nbsp; That worked perfectly, I could join the group and really be part of the conversation.</p>



<p><strong>REAL telepresence</strong></p>



<p>The cool thing is that I was really there. I mean that thing rolling around was ME! On one hand I was like “wow, awesome, I teleported to Stockholm and shapeshifted along the way!”. A true out-of-body experience. On the other I hand I was like “HELP! I’m stuck inside this thing! My body has become and ipad on a stick on wheels!”.</p>



<p>I had the distinct sensation of “Wow, so this is what it’s like being a drunk&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraplegia">tetraplegic</a>&nbsp;with bad hearing and a weak voice.”</p>



<p>Tetraplegic, because I’m effectively paralyzed from the neck down – the double doesn’t even have legs or arms. I could see and hear, and I could roll around like in a wheelchair. But slowly and carefully, and I sometimes needed assistance when things got in the way. Sometimes I got assistance, even when I didn’t need it, which felt both good and bad at the same time. Gradually people noticed that I could get around quite nicely myself, with some patience. I can’t turn my head, but I can turn my whole vehicle from side to side to see what’s going on. Of course, I don’t know what it’s really like to be a tetraplegic but I guess it’s probably something like this.</p>



<p>Drunk, because that thing sways quite often to stay in balance, and sometimes bumps into things or trips on small objects and falls flat on it’s face (happened only once, but it felt horrible).</p>



<p>Bad hearing and weak voice, because of the background noise in combination with my rather limited microphone and speaker. I often couldn’t follow the conversation going on, and people had to lean in close to hear what I was saying.</p>



<p>Another interesting thing. Sometimes when I rolled up to a group of people, they stopped talking and stared at me instead. As if I was some kind of object (and maybe I was…. or maybe not? Any philosophers out there?). Lots of smiles and laughs of course, and the occasional shocked surprised as someone realized that “hey, there’s a person inside that thing!”. In some cases I felt more like a comic relief than a true conference participant. While listening in on a conversation (well, trying…) I sometimes noticed people staring at me, and they couldn’t see that I was staring right back at them. A weird feeling of eye contact and, well, not.</p>



<p>Although, I admit, it was quite fun to sometimes bump into people and see them shriek in surprise at being accosted by an ipad on a stick on wheels, with a grinning guy on the screen. Even earned me a kiss on the cheek once. Or at least that’s what I&nbsp;<em>think</em>&nbsp;she was doing. It wasn’t a slap at least, I don’t think.</p>



<p>I asked one guy for some coffee, and he almost did, until he realized what he was talking to :o)</p>



<p><strong>Running out of batteries</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately the ipad on the double wasn’t fully charged from start, so it started running low quite quickly. I didn’t want to disrupt the ongoing presentation, so I tweeted for help, and someone kindly plugged me in.</p>



<figure><a href="http://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/need-batteries.jpg"><img src="https://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/need-batteries.jpg?w=562&amp;h=499" alt="Image"></a></figure>



<p>During a break, I logged off to make it charge faster (which it didn’t). Then later, when logging in again, I found myself standing a few meters away from the nearest person. I wanted to be unplugged so I could move around! Heeeeelp! but nobody could hear me! Now what? I guess I could tweet again, but it might take a while for someone to react.</p>



<p>Ah, I could display a message on my screen! But how? The app on my end will only send the video stream, i.e. my face on the camera. I can’t get it to display something else. Ah, I could write a note! But darn, I’m sitting on a beach in Thailand and no paper or pen nearby.</p>



<p>Then I realized that I had my laptop with me (as backup solution). So I fired up textedit and wrote a message</p>



<figure><a href="http://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/unplug-me.png"><img src="https://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/unplug-me.png?w=256&amp;h=224" alt="Image"></a></figure>



<p>I made the font huge (as in covering the whole screen), and pointed my ipad cam at it. And moved it back and forth a bit for effect (causing the text to pulsate). That worked! People at the conference saw the message quickly and unplugged me.</p>



<p>The charger didn’t work though, so I was still at about 10%. I figured I’d just participate as long as I could, and the battery would die when it died. That was also a weird feeling, knowing that at any moment I will “die”, my double will go limp, and I’ll suddenly wake up back on the beach in Thailand. Total Matrix moment! I saw the battery counter go lower and lower, and my minutes were numbered, so I had to make the most of it. Carpe Minutus! Seize the minute!</p>



<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>



<ul><li>Double is a supercool and practical gadget, looks nice and takes very little space.</li><li>Watching a presentation works</li><li>Having conversations in small groups works, but not if there’s other conversations happening nearby.</li><li>Moving around works, but slowly, and not with big thresholds or stairs.</li></ul>



<p>Features I would love to have:</p>



<ul><li>the ability to “tilt my head” upwards a bit. I could look down at my wheel via a nifty fold-down mirror (great for navigating around chairs and such), but I couldn’t look up, and the robot is rather short even when fully extended, so often I found myself involuntarily staring at someone’s chest as they talked to me. A bit awkward, especially with girls….)</li><li>the ability to display a message or sketch, not just my videocam &amp; face all the time.</li><li>the ability to plug myself in for charging, like the docking pads that lawnmower robots use.</li><li>a louder speaker, for noisy environments</li><li>a directional mic that can be activated/deactivated, in cases where I want to hear the person in front of me and ignore the background noise.</li></ul>



<p>Oh, and If you’re going to sit on a beach in Thailand in the middle of the night, make sure you have mosquito repellant. And don’t forget the hands! I have like 30 mosquito bites on my hands, I’ll probably get dengue fever or something. But heck, sometimes you have to make sacrifices for science!</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>A malicous attacker could control the content of push notifications to any application that runs the FCM SDK and has it’s FCM server key exposed &amp; at the same time send these notifications to every single user of the vulnerable application!</p>
<p>These notifications could contain anything the attacker wants including graphic/disturbing images(via the <code>"image": "url-to-image"</code> attribute) accompanied with any demeaning or politically inclined message in the notification!</p>
<hr>
<p>The beginning of this year has seen a lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23androidhackingmonth&amp;src=typed_query">#AndroidHackingMonth</a> tweets popup which led to some pretty good disclosures showing different techniques and tricks with respect to android application hacking. I was intrigued and decided to fiddle a little with android hacking.</p>

<h2 id="gathering-a-dataset-of-decompiled-apks">Gathering a dataset of Decompiled APKs</h2>
<p>After rammaging through a dozen blogs on how to begin with hacking android applications and reading them to the best of my abilities, I decided to initially start with looking for secrets in an android application.</p>
<p>This meant decompiling an android apk and just grepping for some know patterns within the <code>strings.xml</code> file as that’s usually where secrets can be found and also the decompiled <code>.smali</code> files for “secret declaration” within the code i.e mediocre static code analysis. Sounds like a good first step!</p>
<p>I started downloading apks of some public and private programs from <a href="https://hackerone.com/">Hackerone</a> and <a href="https://bugcrowd.com/">Bugcrowd</a> so as to collect an initial dataset and then go in looking for secrets all together.</p>
<p>I was able to achieve this by the help of <a href="https://github.com/defparam/h1passets">h1passets</a>. I also sent in a mediocre <a href="https://github.com/defparam/h1passets/pull/2">PR</a> to collect all the package ids of the apks of Hackerone’s private programs. I then scraped a few package ids of public programs of HackerOne and Bugcrowd from <a href="https://github.com/arkadiyt/bounty-targets-data">bounty-targets-data</a>.</p>
<p>Once the package ids were collected, I took some time out to download them from <a href="https://apkcombo.com/">apkcombo</a>. After having close to 50-70 apks downloaded into a single folder, I began mass decompiling these apks using <a href="https://bitbucket.org/iBotPeaches/apktool/downloads/">apktool.jar</a>.</p>
<p>I did this with a simple bash script shown below</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>#!/bin/bash
</span><span></span>
<span>for</span> file in *.apk
<span>do</span>
java -jar ~/APK_Research/apktool.jar d <span>$file</span> -o decompiled_apks/<span>$file</span>/
<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So now I had a credible sized dataset of decompiled apks to work with!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="variable-names-have-it-all">Variable names have it all</h2>
<p>After hooking up <a href="https://github.com/tomnomnom/gf">gf</a> (A wrapper around grep) with a modified version of regex patterns from <a href="https://github.com/xyele/zile">Zile</a> (i remeber this was named something else initially), I began a simple gf grep through the decompiled apks directory to see if I could spot some secrets right away and report them.</p>
<p>I used my vps to run overnight gf greps from the Decompiled_apks folder and saved those results in separate files for further analysis. These saved files contain the API key/secret, their location and also their variable name.</p>
<p>Come the next day, I looked up most of the files and found pretty much nothing, just a bunch of SDK keys which were meant to be public, API keys with limited scope etc.</p>
<p>It was time to look into the <code>gcp_keys.txt</code> that contained the google cloud project (GCP) API keys. I knew they would usually contain API keys for Google Maps Or Google Crash Reporting API which had no impact.</p>
<p>But it was common knowledge that GCP keys could be multi-privileged i.e  the same key could be utilized for different enabled API’s!</p>
<p>So I began looking into the <code>gcp_keys.txt</code> file but with more focus on the variable names. Variable names can sometimes provide a lot of information about the privilege of the key. Here’s a rough snippet of the variable names I encountered inside the <code>gcp_keys.txt</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="xml">apk-1/AndroidManifest.xml: <span>&lt;meta-data</span> android:name=<span>"server_key"</span> android:value=<span>"AIzaSyB[REDACTED]"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
apk-3/trx.smali:    const-string v1, "AIzaSyQ[REDACTED]"
apk-5/AndroidManifest.xml: <span>&lt;meta-data</span> android:name=<span>"com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"</span> android:value=<span>"AIzaSy[REDACTED]"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
apk-8/res/values/strings.xml: <span>&lt;string</span> name=<span>"google_maps_geocoder_key"</span><span>&gt;</span>AIzaSyl[REDACTED]<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
apk-2/res/values/strings.xml: <span>&lt;string</span> name=<span>"notification_server_key"</span><span>&gt;</span>AIzaSyl[REDACTED]<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
apk-4/AndroidManifest.xml: <span>&lt;meta-data</span> android:name=<span>"com.google.android.maps.v2.API_KEY"</span> android:value=<span>"AIzaSy[REDACTED]"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So from the file, I was able to extract the below list of <em>as I call it</em> potential variable names.</p>
<p>google_maps_geocoder_key, notification_server_key, google_notification_key, app_api_key, googlePlacesWebApi, server_key … etc</p>
<p>I felt these keys were capable of something more! I started looking for articles/blogs containing similar variable names in order to conclude what exactly the key does.</p>
<p>Both <code>server_key</code> and <code>notification_server_key</code> led me to <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/server">Firebase Cloud Messaging / FCM</a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-fcm-server-key---reading-docs-and-validation-of-the-key">The FCM Server Key - Reading docs and validation of the key</h2>
<p>After visiting <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/server">Firebase Cloud Messaging / FCM</a> ,i understood that the keys grepped could somehow be linked to cloud messaging aka push notification services. I was yet to find an article that explained everything, so I started digging again.</p>
<p>From the docs I got a gyst of a few things.</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a server environment which deals with <strong>Send Requests</strong> i.e authorized requests that enforce push notifications</li>
<li>There’s a client FCM SDK that takes care of generating IID tokens that identifies an app instance on a device uniquely.</li>
</ul>
<p>Possibilities with the keys at hand? I either could have a key that has some role in the server environment or a client-end SDK key which was already meant to be public.</p>
<p>I focused on the server environment and came across the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/migrate-v1">Legacy to HTTP v1 server protocol migration guide</a> . This article recommended migrating from a <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref">Legacy HTTP protocol</a> to the modern HTTP v1.</p>
<p>But as you see, It also shows how the <code>AizaSy</code> keys can be used as authorization keys under the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/migrate-v1#update-authorization-of-send-requests">before section</a>, the same is shown in the image below</p>
<p><img src="https://abss.me/posts/fcm-takeover/aizasy.png" alt="FCM Authorization done via AizasY" title="FCM Authorization"></p>
<p>From this,  I figured the <code>AizaSy</code> keys are used for authorization of <strong>Send Requests</strong> via the Legacy HTTP protocol. This meant sending push notifications of my choice via the legacy HTTP protocol.</p>
<p>We cannot use the modern HTTP v1 protocol as it is based on the oauth2.0  security model. This makes use of bearer tokens of service accounts.</p>
<p>So reading the docs <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/auth-server#authorize-http-requests">here</a> under the legacy http protocol, I found a simple <code>curl</code> to validate the key.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>api_key</span><span>=</span>YOUR_SERVER_KEY

curl --header <span>"Authorization: key=</span><span>$api_key</span><span>"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>     --header Content-Type:<span>"application/json"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>     https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send <span>\
</span><span></span>     -d <span>"{\"registration_ids\":[\"ABC\"]}"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>If the above curl returns a <code>200 OK</code> response status code then the key is legit. Anything other than <code>200 OK</code> and the key is invalid. Testing this on one of the suspected keys showed a <code>200 OK</code> response status code!</p>
<p>I knew how to validate the key and also the purpose of the key.</p>
<p>To sum things up, here is an overview of the FCM Architecture</p>
<p><img src="https://abss.me/posts/fcm-takeover/fcm-workings.png" alt="FCM Architecture"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="discovering-key-variations">Discovering Key Variations</h2>
<p>As I was reading the forementioned <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/auth-server#authorize-http-requests">article</a> on authorizing legacy HTTP requests, I followed the first instruction that said to visit the <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/cloudmessaging/">Cloud Messaging tab</a> of the firebase project in order to locate the FCM server key <code>AizaSy</code> and there I found another variation of the key!</p>
<p>The image below shows both variations of a FCM server key.</p>
<p><img src="https://abss.me/posts/fcm-takeover/fcm_keys.png" alt="FCM Keys" title="FCM Authorization"></p>
<p>The FCM server key of regEx <code>AAAA[A-Za-z0-9_-]{7}:[A-Za-z0-9_-]{140}</code> is similar to the Legacy Server key i.e both are project credentials having authority over sending authorized send requests to all FCM SDK enabled applications under the firebase project. This key type is recommended to be used as per the docs.</p>
<p>Later on, my search for various blogs regarding the GCM( Google Cloud Messaging ) to FCM migration I noticed there is also the possibility of a gcp key to exist with formerly gcm permissions as seen <a href="https://www.izooto.com/blog/generate-gcm-sender-id-server-api-key">here</a>.</p>
<p>GCM has been long deprecated but due to migration and to stop any regressions, such keys were still valid for the new FCM endpoints! This is the final variation of the FCM server key.</p>
<p>So we have 3 types of FCM server keys :</p>
<ul>
<li>A FCM server key of regEx <code>AAAA[A-Za-z0-9_-]{7}:[A-Za-z0-9_-]{140}</code></li>
<li>A Legacy FCM server Key of regEx <code>AIzaSy[0-9A-Za-z_-]{33}</code>. This gets automatically added to your GCP project.</li>
<li>A GCP key with FCM privileges of the same regEx as above <code>AIzaSy[0-9A-Za-z_-]{33}</code>. In This variation, the key is createdunder a GCP project and then provided the essential privileges.</li>
</ul>
<p>As of now the Legacy Server Key has been deprectaed, so any forthcoming firebase project will not contain Legacy Server Keys anymore :</p>
<p><img src="https://abss.me/posts/fcm-takeover/deprecated_legacy_server-key.png" alt="Deprecated Legacy Server Key" title="FCM Authorization"></p>
<p>But if found, they are still valid! (again to prevent any backlogs and regressions!)</p>
<p>I quickly added the new regEx <code>AAAA[A-Za-z0-9_-]{7}:[A-Za-z0-9_-]{140}</code> to my gf profile and began another round of grep through the decompiled apk dataset and validated them!</p>
<p>Below is the combined gf profile for all key variations</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
    <span>"flags"</span>: <span>"-oEarHn"</span>,
    <span>"patterns"</span>: [

     <span>"AIzaSy[0-9A-Za-z_-]{33}"</span>,
     <span>"AAAA[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{7}:[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{140}"</span>
 ]
}
</code></pre></div><p>More hits followed!</p>
<p>After grepping for the keys, I wrote a simple validation script that places all conforming FCM keys into a single txt file</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">
<span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>while</span> <span>read</span> -r key
<span>do</span>
<span>code</span><span>=</span><span>`</span>curl --header <span>"Authorization: key=</span><span>$key</span><span>"</span> --header Content-Type:<span>"application/json"</span> -s -o /dev/null -w <span>"%{http_code}"</span> -d <span>"{\"registration_ids\":[\"ABC\"]}"</span> <span>'https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send'</span><span>`</span>
<span>if</span> <span>[</span> <span>"</span><span>$code</span><span>"</span> <span>==</span> <span>"200"</span> <span>]</span>
<span>then</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"[*]       Key is </span><span>$key</span><span>"</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"</span><span>$key</span><span>"</span> &gt;&gt; valid_keys.txt
<span>fi</span>

<span>#gcp_keys.txt has the all the grepped keys, both AAAA[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{7}:[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{140} and AIzaSy[0-9A-Za-z_-]{33}</span>
<span>done</span>&lt;<span>"/gcp_keys.txt"</span>

<span>#eliminate duplicates</span>
sort -u -o valid_keys.txt valid_keys.txt
<span>echo</span> <span>"DONE!"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>To my surprise, my initial dataset of 50 decompiled apks gathered A LOT of …</p></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Computer Programming can be hard , can be complex to understand for some people, but that doesn’t mean that they can’t be fun. From the beginning , programming languages were in English , well most of them except some special languages. But I have designed a programming language which let’s people program in Cats’ language, Mew Mew Mew. Which despite being a esoteric language is very much usable , and let’s programmers create complex program. I
also have conducted a small study to find real world use cases of MewMew programming language.</p>



<p>Programming in Cats’ language , it is lunacy or what? But it’s reality. With MewMew one can program in cats’ language, but it is not actually the cats’ language but the human interpretation of cats’ language , mew mew mew.
MewMew is an esoteric programming language built with ANTLR4 and C++. It is not intended to be used for commercial or mainstream programming instead , it was designed to be learning project for me or any other novice language designer who want get started building their own programming language.
While majority of programming languages are in English or I should say human languages but this language intends to be one of the first language to be in ‘non-human’ (not technically) language.</p>



<p>MewMew is implemented using ANTLR4 and C++. Though using Dynamically typed host language would be given me more flexibilty designing the language, I chose to use a statically typed for a multiple reasons , First it is fast. Second , the language becomes much more runtime safe. When experimenting with early prototypes , I tried Python and PLY (Python Lex and Yacc) , Tatsu and even Flex &amp; Bison. Python and PLY was not chosen because it was too much slow , even Cythonzing didn’t give advantage. Tatsu was kind of better than PLY but again speed issue, and Flex &amp; Bison , I didn’t chose them because of their over complexity , a language small as MewMew required a huge codebase. Finally I setteled for ANTLR4 , It was comparativaly fast thanks to its ALL(*) algorithm , on top of that the API of it was very easy to catch on but also very robust.
When Designing MewMew , I left some places which can be used to improve or extend the language in future.</p>

<p>MewMew doesn’t use any traditional numbers (0 to 9) instead it uses ‘mew’s. For example , ‘mew’ will get converted to 1 , ‘mewmew’ will get converted to 2  , ‘mewmewmewmewmewmewmewmewmewmew’ will get converted to 10 and so on so forth but zero has special case , to get only zero one can use ‘mew-mew’.
MewMew also has few operator similar to C++, which are discussed in GitHub project repository README. MewMew is all about numbers, it doesn’t contain any other types such as strings , chars , arrays etc , which keeps the language lightweight. Every number in mewmew is a floating point number.
MewMew also has if , if else and a repeat loop aka. Meow loop expression. It also has a special type of function called scratch function which open the door of extending the language in future. Syntax of if statement is something like Expression ? Statements ; where ‘Expression’ takes any type of expression , on Truthy value the ‘Statements’ will get executed. Similar to that Expression ? Statements1 : Statements2 ; is the syntax of if-else statement, if the value of ‘Expression’ is truthy the ‘Statements1’ will get executed else ‘Statement2’ will get executed. The syntax of meow loop is something like this @ Expression : Statements; the ‘Statements’ will get executed N times where N = Expression. Scratch function syntax is something like #(Expression) where ‘#’ can be repeated from 1 to many times. But as of 5 functions are defined only.</p>

<p>Here’s a comparison of some simple program written in MewMew and C++ :</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>In MewMew</th>
      <th>In C++</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>m=mew;<br>@#####(mew):<br>m % mewmew == mew – mew ?<br>::m;<br>;<br>m = m + mew;<br>;<br></td>
      <td>#include <iostream><br>using namespace std;<p>int main()<br>{<br>for(int m = 1; m &lt;= 100 ; ++m){<br>if (m%2 == 0){<br>cout &lt;&lt; m &lt;&lt; endl;<br>}<br>}<br>}</p></iostream></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>m=mew;<br>@####(mew):<br>m % mewmewmew == mew – mew &amp; m % ###(mew) == mew – mew ? <br>::m;<br>;<br>m = m + mew;<br>;<br></td>
      <td>#include <iostream><br>using namespace std;<p>int main()<br>{<br>for(int m = 1; m &lt;= 100 ; ++m){<br>if (m%3 == 0 &amp;&amp; m%5==0){<br>cout &lt;&lt; m &lt;&lt; endl;<br>}<br>}<br>}</p></iostream></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



<p>MewMew is an esoteric language which is morelike a joke than a commercial language. It was created to be a leaning project for which it has done successfully. In future it also might work as an reference to learning language designing for future.With the scratch function it opens new doors forexpanding the language in future. It will only took a few lines of code in switch…case statement to add a new function.</p>

<p><span>In every industry but tech, there’s hundreds of competitors within each vertical.</span></p>
<p><span>By building something that already exists, it curtails the initial validation period for a product.</span></p>
<p><span>As a maker, it’s taken me over two years to truly understand this concept.</span></p>
<p><span>After listening to every Indie Hackers podcast, this was a common theme I’d recognised between the most successful products.</span></p>
<p><span>Whether it be Less Annoying CRM, Transistor.FM, or The Hustle, these products entered a pre-conceived vertical with existing customer demand.</span></p>
<p><span>Until now, it feels like I’ve spent my early 20’s in the pursuit of product/market fit.</span></p>
<p><span>What I never understood, was that it already existed across thousands of markets.</span></p>
<p><span>With a background working in tech startups, I’ve always valued innovation above anything else.</span></p>
<p><span>After spending two full years failing to gain any product traction, I realised this was my greatest weakness as a maker.</span></p>
<p><span>After two years of building products, I’d generated $0 in revenue.</span></p>
<p><span>In August 2020, I generated my first $66 (AUD) from a product in less than 24 hours.</span></p>
<p><span>How did I do it?</span></p>
<p><span>By prioritising validation instead of innovation.</span></p>
<p><span>Although it’s not much, this $66 was a gargantuan milestone in my maker journey.</span></p>

<p><span>Let me quickly backtrack and give you a brief history of my experiences leading to this point.</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re an early-stage maker struggling to generate revenue, this post will share some actionable insights to help streamline your own product journey.</span></p>


<hr>


<p><span><b>June 2018</b></span></p>
<p><span>In 2018, I had my first surreal moment to becoming a maker. It was my first idea for a product.</span></p>
<p><span>I wanted to build the </span><a href="https://dribbble.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Dribbble</span></a><span> for digital marketers.</span></p>
<p><span>As a digital marketer myself, I planned to create a platform where I could showcase a portfolio of my real work.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My vision was to build the worlds leading community hub for digital marketers, streamlining the way they showcase work and source job opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span>As a non-technical maker, I started building with the tools I had.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before creating a product, I spent a year of my life trying to build an existing community as a Facebook group.</span></p>
<p><span>At its peak, I’d grown this community to roughly 300 members, although I’m sure only a fraction of these were active users.</span></p>
<p><span>Looking back, I’m thankful that I tried to build a community before creating a product, although, to be fair, I didn’t have any other option – I didn’t know how to code.</span></p>


<hr>


<p><span><b>June 2019</b></span></p>
<p><span>A year later, I stumbled across the no-code landscape.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This changed everything.</span></p>
<p><span>I could finally build my grand vision for a platform.</span></p>
<p><span>This was where I started spiralling down a path of first-time maker mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span>Did I even bother to ask my community if this was a platform they wanted?</span></p>
<p><span>No.</span></p>
<p><span>Did I validate the idea?</span></p>
<p><span>Certainly not.</span></p>
<p><span>Was this a product that could even generate revenue from day one?</span></p>
<p><span>Not a chance.</span></p>
<p><span>So when November of 2019 came around, I was so confused when my platform hadn’t gained any real traction.</span></p>
<p><span>I’d spent four straight months building this product, then an additional two months trying to gain user adoption.</span></p>
<p><span>I completely burnt myself out trying to maintain something that never had a chance.</span></p>
<p><span>So what did I decide to do?</span></p>
<p><span>Tear it down and start again.</span></p>


<hr>


<p><span><b>January 2020</b></span></p>
<p><span>It’s a new year and I’d had the opportunity to learn first-hand from my past mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span>At this point, I’m 18 months into making and I hadn’t generated a single dollar in revenue.</span></p>
<p><span>This time around, I had clear expectations and guidelines to follow.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>I had to sell to businesses</span></li>
<li><span>I wasn’t allowed to build a product until I’d confidently validated an idea</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>At this point, I was freelancing as a digital marketer, so I was still eager to build a product within this industry.</span></p>
<p><span>After hearing </span><a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/how-to-build-a-life-you-love-by-quitting-everything-else-with-lynne-tye-of-key-values-706009faea" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Lynne Tye’s episode</span></a><span> of the Indie Hackers podcast, I knew exactly what I needed to build.</span></p>
<p><span>I was going to build the </span><a href="https://www.keyvalues.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Key Values</span></a><span> for digital marketers. It’d be a place where passionate digital marketers could source opportunities with teams that shared their values.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the core reasons why I’m a freelancer is because I’d never found a company to work for that shared my own personal values.</span></p>
<p><span>I was absolutely blown away when I first heard Lynne’s story.</span></p>
<p><span>Her product wasn’t anything technically advanced, and her background wasn’t in marketing. So how was it that Lynne was able to gain as much traction as she did?</span></p>
<p><span>She solved a real problem for businesses and spent a long time validating her idea.</span></p>
<p><span>I was eager to get started, but I encountered my first problem.</span></p>
<p><span>I live in Brisbane, Australia. In my city, I’ve never met a startup big enough to need a dedicated marketing team.</span></p>
<p><span>What was my alternative?</span></p>
<p><span>I knew I had to get myself over to SF – the heart of the startup landscape.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From an outsiders perspective, there was an endless sea of opportunity there.</span></p>
<p><span>I booked my flights for May, then start cold emailing as many marketing recruiters as possible.</span></p>
<p><span>I shared the concept of my product and asked if they’d be interested in joining pre-launch.</span></p>
<p><span>Within a few weeks, I’d been on calls with recruiters from Intercom, Pinterest, Harry’s, and Tray.io.</span></p>
<p><span>My plan was to get these brands on board before launch – making the product more valuable when I release it to the public.</span></p>
<p><span>I didn’t expect to charge these initial brands. I was simply looking for validation.</span></p>
<p><span>On March 13th, I had a call with a recruiter from a startup that had recently raised a $50 million round.</span></p>
<p><span>She was looking to quickly scale her marketing team with quality candidates.</span></p>
<p><span>“This is exactly the kind of product I need right now”.</span></p>
<p><span>Then. The unbelievable happened.</span></p>
<p><span>“So, we’re obviously happy to pay you for the work you do with this. How much is it going to cost”.</span></p>
<p><span>I freeze.</span></p>
<p><span>I genuinely didn’t expect the call to veer this way.</span></p>
<p><span>I respond.</span></p>
<p><span>“Well. Umm. It’s free for any brands that join before launch, but later we can talk about paying for access to additional features I have in my backlog”.</span></p>
<p><span>WHAT. THE. FUCK.</span></p>
<p><span>I couldn’t explain how disappointed I was in myself. At the same time, I was at an all-time high.</span></p>
<p><span>I finally had early signs of validation.</span></p>
<p><span>This feeling only lasted a short week.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>COVID came.</span></p>
<p><span>It didn’t spare anyone in the recruitment industry.</span></p>
<p><span>I was so close, but the timing couldn’t have been worse.</span></p>
<p><span>I knew this wasn’t going away for a long time.</span></p>


<hr>


<p><span><b>April 2020</b></span></p>
<p><span>Throughout isolation, I needed a project to keep me sane.</span></p>
<p><span>I decided to break my own rule and start building my product.</span></p>
<p><span>I knew this wasn’t a good use of my time, but what else was I going to do during COVID?</span></p>
<p><span><span>I build the</span> </span><a href="https://clickthrough.marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>site</span></a><span> in WordPress, then started working on SEO tasks. I was determined to use this downtime during COVID to build an organic growth machine.</span></p>
<p><span>I started building backlinks and publishing content. It’d been years since I had the chance to work on any SEO projects, so I used this time to up-skill my practical knowledge as a digital marketer.</span></p>
<p><span>In the space of four months, I managed to generate 142 high-quality backlinks, tripling my sites domain ranking.</span></p>

<p><span>As any SEO knows, building backlinks was an absolute slog.</span></p>
<p><span>This whole process involved writing original 2,000 – 3,000 word guest articles for some of the industries biggest publishers.</span></p>
<p><span>At the same time, I needed to also publish high-quality content to my own site to start ranking for keywords that would generate traffic.</span></p>
<p><span>Every second week, I’d publish a 5,000 article to my own site. You can check these out </span><a href="https://clickthrough.marketing/most-in-demand-marketing-skills-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>here</span></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://clickthrough.marketing/top-product-marketing-manager-interview-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Surely enough, I started to burn out.</span></p>
<p><span>As someone that doesn’t enjoy writing, the thought of having to create another article started to make me feel sick.</span></p>
<p><span>I needed something else to temporarily work on.</span></p>


<hr>


<p><span><b>August 2020</b></span></p>
<p><span>I decided to take a day off and clean my house. I started clearing my wardrobe of the clothes I no longer wore.</span></p>
<p><span>It’d been years since I’d bought new clothes, so my wardrobe didn’t cater to my recent taste or personality.</span></p>
<p><span>As an overly passionate maker, I wanted to start wearing startup shirts throughout my everyday life.</span></p>
<p><span>The only problem, however, is that startups shirts are notoriously hideous and bold.</span></p>


<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="3100" data-permalink="https://lachlankirkwood.com/2020/08/27/product-maker-journey/startup-shirts/" data-orig-file="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png" data-orig-size="1200,628" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Startup-Shirts" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=748" src="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=1024" alt="Startup teeshirts" srcset="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=1024 1024w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=150 150w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=300 300w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=768 768w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p><span>There it was. A new problem.</span></p>
<p><span>My solution…</span></p>
<p><span>Why don’t I just make my own?</span></p>
<p><span>I wanted to create a minimalist series of shirts that I could wear to any occasion. Whether I’m working at home, going out to dinner, or meeting with friends, these shirts needed to be discrete enough to match the rest of my wardrobe.</span></p>


<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="3122" data-permalink="https://lachlankirkwood.com/2020/08/27/product-maker-journey/ship-it-shirt/" data-orig-file="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png" data-orig-size="1920,1280" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Ship-It-Shirt" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png?w=748" src="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png?w=1024" alt="Maker Threads startup shirt" srcset="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png?w=1024 1024w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png?w=150 150w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png?w=300 300w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png?w=768 768w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ship-it-shirt.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p><span>I jump online and print three of my own custom shirts. It costs me $75.</span></p>
<p><span>Then it hit me. I wonder if other makers like myself who experience this same problem.</span></p>
<p><span>I sent a photo to my friend who’s a software engineer, then tell him my idea.</span></p>
<p><span>His response.</span></p>

<p><span>It’s time to get to work, but this time I planned to be scrupulous about the process.</span></p>
<p><span>My goal was to spend a day validating this idea, then determine if it was something I should pursue.</span></p>
<p><span>If I couldn’t validate the concept, I’d return to posting blog content.</span></p>
<p><span>I spent a few hours creating some shirt designs in Canva.</span></p>
<p><span>Next, I was I’m ready to build my own online store.</span></p>
<p><span>I had to stop myself there.</span></p>
<p><span>If I’m building a Shopify store, I’ll need to buy a domain, design the store itself, then pay for a Shopify subscription.</span></p>
<p><span>This would consume too much time and money. After all, I’m only seeking validation.</span></p>
<p><span>I head to Teespring. I upload my designs to their print-on-demand store and use their default storefront.</span></p>

<p><span>Like most small makers, every Product Hunt launch I’ve shared in the past has amassed to no traction.</span></p>

The deal ensures that iPhone, iPad, and Mac users search with Google when they use Safari. That is unless they manually change the default search engine in Safari’s preferences.</p><p>The deal between Apple and Google may be coming to an end soon. In July 2020, Reuters reported that the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-google/uk-regulators-take-aim-at-apples-search-engine-deal-with-google-idUSKBN242748">taking aim at the deal</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Given the impact of preinstallations and defaults on mobile devices and Apple’s significant market share, it is our view that Apple’s existing arrangements with Google create a significant barrier to entry and expansion for rivals affecting competition between search engines on mobiles.</p><cite>U.K. Competition and Markets Authority Report</cite></blockquote><p>If the U.K. regulators take action, there may be a ripple effect from the European Union, which has a history of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_vs._Google">going after Google for anti-competitive behavior</a>. Regulators in Europe may force Apple to remove Google as the default search engine and have users choose which search engine they want to use when they first launch Safari.</p><h2>Why Apple might be launching a search engine</h2><p>Regulatory pressure, a contentious relationship with Google, and the maturation of Apple’s Siri and iCloud are presenting an opportunity for Apple to create and launch a search engine. There are several signs right now that indicate Apple may be doing just that.</p><h3>Apple doesn’t need Google’s money</h3><p>Apple is now the world’s most valuable company. They may want the money Google gives them, but they don’t need it.</p><h3>Apple is pouring resources and money into search</h3><p>Apple is investing heavily in search, as shown in their <a href="https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/search?search=search%20engineer&amp;sort=relevance">job postings for search engineers</a>. The job listings reveal they incorporate AI, ML, NLP, and more into all of their services and apps.</p><h3>iOS and iPadOS 14 beta bypasses Google Search with Spotlight Search</h3><p>It’s not clear if Apple uses Bing anymore, as results are labeled only as Siri Suggestions. It is clear that Apple has started to return search results within Spotlight Search and is <a href="https://www.coywolf.news/seo/ios-ipados-14-spotlight-search-google-threat/">completely bypassing Google</a> altogether.</p> <stream src="ce5235df57f7501f313fe1eeada06ece" poster="https://videodelivery.net/ce5235df57f7501f313fe1eeada06ece/thumbnails/thumbnail.jpg?time=7s" preload="" autoplay="" loop="" mute=""></stream>  <h3>Apple recently updated its Applebot web crawler page</h3><p>In July 2020, Apple published a significant update to its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204683">About Applebot support page</a>. The additions are very similar to the details Google provides to <a href="https://www.coywolf.news/topics/webmaster/">webmasters</a> and <a href="https://www.coywolf.news/topics/seo/">SEOs</a>. Here are the changes they made to the Applebot support page.</p><ul><li>Added how to verify traffic from Applebot</li><li>Expanded details on the Applebot user agent, including differences between its desktop and mobile version</li><li>Expanded robots.txt rules</li><li>Added a section stating that they don’t just crawl HTML, but also render pages similar to Google</li><li>Added a section on search rankings and the factors that affect how it ranks web search results</li></ul><h3>Applebot has been busy crawling sites</h3><p>Checking my server logs on <a href="https://coywolf.io/wpengine">WP Engine</a> revealed that Applebot had been regularly crawling my sites daily, something I haven’t noticed until now.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1820" height="1563" src="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files.png 1820w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files-300x258.png 300w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files-1024x879.png 1024w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files-768x660.png 768w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files-1536x1319.png 1536w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files-734x630.png 734w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files-150x129.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1820px) 100vw, 1820px"><figcaption>Server log of Applebot crawling Coywolf News</figcaption></figure><h2>What Apple has to gain from launching a search engine</h2><p>A search engine from Apple will likely look and function slightly different from modern search engines like Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo. That’s because Apple historically likes to do things differently, and their search engine will serve a different purpose than showing ads and data mining.</p><p>Based on Apple’s numerous search engineer job descriptions, and the continued consolidation of web and app results in Spotlight Search, an Apple search engine will likely function as a highly personalized data hub. It will be similar to Google Assistant on Android, but different since it (initially) won’t have ads, will be completely private, and have significantly deeper integrations with the OS.</p><p>One can imagine getting easy buy-in from users if they benefit from privacy, coupled with the seamless integration and personalization of their iCloud data. Apple can leverage AI and ML to deliver search results based on their email, messages, maps, events, reminders, notes, photos, files, contacts, music, news, TV shows and movies, third-party apps, documents, and more. And they can do it without ads and with the promise of real data privacy.</p><p>Apple has a lot to gain from this model. Some of the main benefits include:</p><ul><li>The promotion of apps in search results that will benefit Apple’s services and detract from <a href="https://coywolf.pro/webmaster/progressive-web-app-pwa/">Google’s push towards PWAs</a>.</li><li>A weakening of Google’s monopoly on search and a significant blow to its ad revenue and data mining.</li><li>The promotion of Apple products and services. Including struggling services like Apple News+ and Apple TV+.</li><li>Continued control and lock down of the Apple ecosystem. Users will become dependent on personalized search results with deep service and product integrations that are only possible via their search engine.</li><li>The extension of their ad serving platform will allow app developers to promote their apps in search results.</li></ul><h2>What will this mean for SEO?</h2><p>If Apple can capture enough market share, it will force SEOs to adapt and optimize for their search engine. In some ways, at least based on their Applebot documentation, tactics will remain the same. But SEOs can also expect to test and discover new opportunities that aren’t possible with Google or other modern search engines.</p><p>At this point, everything is based on observation and conjecture. They may never release a search engine. It’s also possible that iOS, iPadOS, and macOS users will be using it and not even be aware of it. It could be so tightly integrated into the operating system and native apps that alerts and Spotlight Searches slowly steal away queries that would have otherwise been made on Google.</p><h2>Never miss an important story</h2><p>Weekly news updates, no spam, and you can unsubscribe anytime.</p> <div><p><img alt="" src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/93d2d6e6492828a2f1f427dddc413f4b?s=120&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/93d2d6e6492828a2f1f427dddc413f4b?s=240&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" height="120" width="120" loading="lazy"></p><div><p><a rel="author" href="https://www.coywolf.news/jon-henshaw/">Jon Henshaw</a></p><p><small>Jon is the founder and Managing Editor of Coywolf.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every so often my programming productivity takes a steep dive as I try to use a new text editor. </p>
<p>Why do I put myself through this? Simply put, I'm a bit of an efficiency fanatic. Fanatic in the sense of pursuing some end with not-entirely-rational vigor and passion. I call it fanatical because the pursuit of ever more efficiency in and of itself takes quite a bit of time, thus actively working against my ostensible goal of being more productive.</p>
<p>Whatever, it's a hobby.</p>

<p>Let's make a timeline. </p>
<h2><code>2011</code> Dreamweaver</h2>
<p>Oh yeah, I started there. This was when I first started learning web development and thought to myself "It's just text and images, how much harder than Word could it be?"</p>
<p>I'm not putting Dreamweaver down—it was actually a very good start. There were professional video tutorials about it since it was part of the Adobe suite. It even had code mode, which is just like any normal text editor.</p>
<p>However, it was not to last. Even with code mode I felt like I wasn't a <span>programmer</span>, whatever that meant. I felt like I needed more of a hacker-ish interface on which to work my magic. </p>
<h2><code>2011</code> Coda</h2>
<p>Yes, same year as Dreamweaver. After a bit of Dreamweaver I discovered Coda, a pretty nifty text editor that's <a href="https://www.panic.com/coda/">still around</a> (as of 2020-08-20). Why do I say that as if it's a big deal? Well, I'd be surprised if anyone who started programming after 2013 knows about it. This is not to say anything bad about the product, I just never met a single other programmer who had used it.</p>
<p>The cool feature that drew me in to Coda was that it could know about your websites. As far as I remember it was pitched as a great editor for creating front-end sites (JS, CSS, HTML). Back then my move was to write some code, open an FTP app and then drag/drop the files into it. Coda handled this nicely and saved me time. </p>
<h2><code>2013</code> Sublime Text</h2>
<p>Then, the programming world collectively gasps as Sublime Text 2 sweeps over the industry (* I doubt the Vim/Emacs people cared much, but as  you can see I was not yet among their numbers).</p>
<p>Sublime Text was just <span>awesome</span>. It was <span>fast</span>. It was minimal yet powerful which appealed to the power user in me. It was <span>not</span> intuitive, it was <span>not</span> discoverable, it was configured via JSON! It was exactly what I wanted.</p>
<p>For two whole years Sublime Was my primary editor and it was great. Along the way it taught me the power of dedicated tools, rather than an integrated suite. I used different apps for my terminal, my FTP client and my editor. </p>
<p>Of course my time with Sublime and the productivity it won me made me want more, and thus paved the way towards the black hole of text editors, the editor form which—once you have learned it—you will never fully detach yourself.</p>
<h2><code>2015</code> Vim</h2>
<p>In 2015 it finally clicked. This was something of a watershed moment in my text editing career. After years of false starts Vim finally took hold of my fingertips and things have never been the same since.</p>
<p>For anyone unaware, Vim is an ancient text editor from the 70s¹ that might already be installed on your computer. It's claim to fame is that it let's you edit <span>any text</span> with only the keyboard. No mouse interaction whatsoever. </p>
<p>Vim is hard to learn. Significantly harder than learning touch-typing. Anyone who already knows how to program but does't know Vim could probably pick it up in a month. However, it took me years. This was probably due to the fact that even I have my limits when it comes to "productivity hacking" and Vim will really, <span>really</span> decrease your productivity for a time. So I never used it much, just gave it another try here and there and eventually it stuck.</p>
<h3>Is it worth it? </h3>
<p>Yes, but it's not for everyone. </p>
<p>If you write a lot of code, or even just prose, using Vim is nothing short of magical. It feels like being in the future already, when computers simply do what we think. </p>
<p>A mouse is an imprecise device. Analog motion (i.e. your hand sliding a mouse across a desk) is relatively intuitive, but it's slow compared to directly telling the computer what you want. Anyone who's used software professionally for long enough understands this. Designers, architects, authors, anyone who uses a computer as a creative tool and uses it <span>a lot</span> eventually feels the strain of repetitive interactions. That's why professional software packages have numerous hotkeys. Even your operating system has numerous hotkeys, even if you don't know them or use them much.</p>
<p>When you're using Vim, everything is a hotkey. Every action you take you take with keys, which offers a great deal of precision and speed when it comes to editing text. </p>
<p>A quick example. Let's say you want to select all the text "here, within these quotes." What do you do? Normally, you just drag the mouse over all the text within the quotes and start typing. No problem! Now consider you have to do this many times a day, perhaps hundreds of times a day, with different text. Sometimes the text wraps around the screen, causing you to have to move your mouse further. Sometimes you accidentally drag too far or not far enough, causing you to have to hit undo and try again. This may all sound minor, but again, consider having to do it hundreds of times a day.</p>
<p>Now, if you're a Vim user you just type <code>ci"</code>. Three characters. The mnemonic for this sequence is "change inner <code>"</code>." The interesting thing is you can use that same <code>ci</code> "change inner ..." command with other characters. For instance <code>ci'</code> will let you change all the text inside single quotes. <code>ci(</code> will let you change all the text inside parens, and so on. It's quite a flexible and highly productive system (once you learn it).</p>
<h2><code>2016</code> Vim + Atom</h2>
<p>Enter Atom. I actually don't have a lot to say about Atom. I used it as my secondary editor since, again, once you've internalized Vim you never go back. However, Vim has a significant drawback: You have to program it to make it play nicely with new languages. That's right, you have to write code just to get your editor to let you write more code in an appealing way.</p>
<p>This is where Atom came in. It's a mainstream text editor in the sense that it has lots of features built-in and it will do its best to help you along the way. It also has a plugin repository where you can search for new plugins that do things like support new programming languages. It even has—and this is key—a plugin to emulate Vim!</p>
<p>So I ended up using Atom whenever I had to work with code that I hadn't yet configured Vim for. It worked out of the box, it was intuitive and it sort of supported Vim-like editing. </p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, at this point my company had hired other developers and as the senior member of the team I needed to be able to recommend a way to edit our codebase—that recommendation was Atom.</p>
<h2><code>2018</code> Vim + VSCode</h2>
<p>So after a couple of years I decided to revisit VSCode. I honestly don't know why, but it became hugely popular and so it came across my radar again. It's a great text editor, but in my view it fills the space that Atom was in so I'm not sure why anyone switched 🤷‍♂️.</p>
<p>Regardless, I tried it out and thought "this is ok." The thing was, at this point I was a much more experienced programmer and <span>really didn't want</span> to spend time not directly solving whatever problem I was working on. I had little patience for configuring text editors, so whenever I tried a new language I would just open up VSCode instead of Vim since it would either immediately work well or have a plugin I could install.</p>
<p>VSCode still filled the space of secondary text editor until one day I discovered <a href="https://github.com/asvetliakov/vscode-neovim">a plugin for VSCode that embeds Vim</a>... 🤯 </p>
<p>Thus the balance switched. Now I use VSCode (in Vim mode) as my primary text editor and Vim as the secondary.</p>
<h2><code>2020</code> Vim + VSCode + Emacs</h2>
<p>And finally we're caught up. 2020 and I'm trying a new text editor. Why? Blame Clojure. Emacs and Lisp languages go very well together so I decided to try out Emacs, and it's pretty neat.</p>
<p>For anyone who doesn't know, Emacs is as old as Vim and has a similar keyboard-centric philosophy. It's also <span>even more</span> customizable than Vim, which is saying quite a lot. However, Emacs is unfortunately famous for forcing your hands into contortions to use various functions. </p>
<p>I only recently started using Emacs, so I can't actually speak to it's long-term utility but it's definitely interesting. Aside from being a lisp-based editor, which highly appeals to me, it also seems to <span>fully</span> support Vim. It emulates Vim but it does it so well that as far as I can tell you get the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>Since I haven't exactly come to any specific point, it's fortunate I didn't start writing this intending to make one. If there was one it would simply be: Pursue your hobbies. </p>
<p>Believe it or not fiddling with text editors brings me joy, so despite the occasional dips in productivity I continue to tinker. Besides, there's always the off chance that I'll become more productive. </p>

<p>This post was discussed on Hacker News: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24290128">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24290128</a></p>

<p><a href="#footnate">¹</a> Vim has become something of a catchall term for Vi and Vim, which are separate editors. Vi was first and Vim didn't show up until the 90s. </p></div></div>]]>

<p>I first learned about <code>libvirt</code> and <code>QEMU</code> three years ago when I wrote a guide on <a href="https://github.com/yoonsikp/macOS-KVM-PCI-Passthrough">how to virtualize macOS on a Linux system</a>. Today I will be showing the opposite, virtualizing Linux on macOS using the same tools. I was surprised that with so many software developers using MacBooks everyday, nobody has created a guide on how to use <code>libvirt</code> and <code>QEMU</code> with macOS.</p>
<p>Why is <code>libvirt</code> and <code>QEMU</code> better? First of all, it's free and open-source. Unlike Parallels Desktop and VMWare Fusion, you won't need to pay for expensive subscriptions or manage licenses. There does exist an open-source alternative (from Oracle!) called VirtualBox, which works pretty well. However, VirtualBox does not support macOS's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/hypervisor">Hypervisor.Framework</a>, a virtualization API created to limit kernel modification. This means the installer will ask for admin access to install kernel extensions, a feature Apple is now <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-deprecating-macos-kernel-extensions-kexts-is-a-great-win-for-security/">phasing out</a> for security reasons. <code>QEMU</code> on the other hand has had support for Hypervisor.Framework since 2018. Just say no to kexts!</p>
<p>Furthermore, like many developers, I like to run VMs headless, i.e. without a desktop GUI, so that I can SSH into them. Running VMs in the background seems like a simple feature, but it requires a lot of complex configuration for both <s><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch07.html#headless-vm-steps">VirtualBox</a></s> and <a href="https://communities.vmware.com/thread/292873">VMWare Fusion</a>. And Parallels wants you buy the <a href="https://kb.parallels.com/en/123298">Pro Edition</a> to gain access. Market segmentation at its finest... With <code>libvirt</code>, VMs start headless. Plus, when you shutdown macOS, it sends a shutdown signal to your VMs as well.</p>
<p>To be clear, <strong>this method doesn't support USB Passthrough, GPU Passthrough, or bridge networking.</strong> But if you just need to test, for example, node.js or nginx on a Linux VM, then this method is great.</p>
<h3 id="installinglibvirtandqemu">Installing libvirt and QEMU</h3>
<ol>
<li>First, install <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a>, which is a package manager for macOS.</li>
<li>Run <code>brew install qemu gcc libvirt</code>. If you installed <code>libvirt</code> version 6.6.0, then also run the following command in Terminal (<a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/59738">GitHub issue</a>):<pre><code>for f in /usr/local/Cellar/libvirt/6.6.0/lib/libvirt/*/*.bundle; do ln -s $f ${f%.bundle}.so; done
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Since macOS doesn't support QEMU security features, we need to disable them:<pre><code>echo 'security_driver = "none"' &gt;&gt; /usr/local/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
echo "dynamic_ownership = 0" &gt;&gt; /usr/local/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
echo "remember_owner = 0" &gt;&gt; /usr/local/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Finally start the libvirt service, with <code>brew services start libvirt</code>. It will start after boot as well.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="installingubuntuserver2004">Installing Ubuntu Server 20.04</h3>
<p>There are two ways to access the virtual display of the VM, either using a VNC client or the virt-viewer program. I recommend <a href="https://www.realvnc.com/">RealVNC Viewer</a>. The VNC client is responsive and quick to install, but if you have multiple VMs you need to manually manage the different ports. With virt-viewer, you get a popup with all the VMs currently running, but it is laggy and takes an eternity to install. <a href="https://github.com/jeffreywildman/homebrew-virt-manager">virt-viewer</a> can be installed through homebrew. The rest of this guide uses VNC.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a <code>vms</code> folder in your home directory, and generate a disk image. Change <code>50g</code> to the size of your prefered disk:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir ~/vms &amp;&amp; cd ~/vms
qemu-img create -f qcow2 ubuntu.qcow2 50g
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download the <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/ubuntu-20.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso">Ubuntu Server 20.04 Install Image</a> and my <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yoonsikp/vm_configs/master/ubuntu.xml">libvirt XML template</a> and place the .iso and .xml files in the same folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modify the following elements in the <code>ubuntu.xml</code> file to match your your VM preferences and file paths. Save, then run <code>virsh define ubuntu.xml</code> followed by <code>virsh start ubuntu</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;domain type='qemu' xmlns:qemu='http://libvirt.org/schemas/domain/qemu/1.0'&gt;
&lt;name&gt;name of the VM&lt;/name&gt;
&lt;memory unit='GB'&gt;how much ram&lt;/memory&gt;
&lt;vcpu&gt;how many cpus&lt;/vcpu&gt;
...
&lt;disk type='file' device='disk'&gt;
&lt;source file='full path to your qcow2 file'/&gt;
...
&lt;disk type='file' device='cdrom'&gt;
&lt;source file='full path to your install iso'/&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start RealVNC Viewer and connect to <code>localhost</code>. Click the <code>Ctrl+Alt+Del</code> button to reboot the machine, and quickly press <code>Esc</code> to get into the boot menu. Press the number that matches the Ubuntu Server image.<br>

</li>
<li>
<p>Install Ubuntu Server normally, making sure to enable the SSH server. Once it restarts you can connect to the VM from your terminal by running <code>ssh -p 2222 user@localhost</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To send a shutdown signal to your VM, run <code>virsh shutdown ubuntu</code>. To force shutdown, run <code>virsh destroy ubuntu</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To forward a port, e.g. port 443 from the VM to port 8443 locally, run the following: <code>ssh -p 2222 -L8443:localhost:443 user@localhost</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="multiplevms">Multiple VMs</h3>
<p>If you want to create multiple VMs, create an XML file for each machine with a unique UUID, VM name, and VNC port. Also, change the <code>hostfwd</code> argument so that each VM exposes a different port for SSH, e.g. <code>2223</code> instead of <code>2222</code>. After you have defined them all, you can get a list of the VMs that are currently running with <code>virsh list</code>.</p>

<h2 id="s1-silence"><a href="#s1-silence">Silence</a></h2>

<p>A Python programmer handed her <code>~/.gitconfig</code> to Master Git.  Among the many
lines were the following:</p>

<pre><code>[alias]
; Explicit is better than implicit.  If we want to merge
; we should do so ourselves.
pull = pull --ff-only</code></pre>

<p>Master Git nodded.  "<code>git pull origin master</code>," said the programmer.</p>

<p>Master Git pulled down the latest changes on <code>master</code> and automatically merged
them with the programmer's changes.</p>

<p>"But Master Git, did I not say to only fast-forward in my configuration?!" she
cried.</p>

<p>Master Git looked at her, nodded, and said nothing.</p>

<p>"Then why did you not warn me of a problem with my configuration?" she asked.</p>

<p>Master Git replied: "there was no problem."</p>

<p>Months later the programmer was reading <code>git --help config</code> for a different
reason and found enlightenment.</p>

<h2 id="s2-one-thing-well"><a href="#s2-one-thing-well">One Thing Well</a></h2>

<p>A UNIX programmer was working in the cubicle farms.  As she saw Master Git
traveling down the path, she ran to meet him.</p>

<p>"It is an honor to meet you, Master Git!" she said.  "I have been studying the
UNIX way of designing programs that each do one thing well.  Surely I can learn
much from you."</p>

<p>"Surely," replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How should I change to a different branch?" asked the programmer.</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>"And how should I create a branch?"</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>"And how should I update the contents of a single file in my working directory,
without involving branches at all?"</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>After this third answer, the programmer was enlightened.</p>

<h2 id="s3-only-the-gods"><a href="#s3-only-the-gods">Only the Gods</a></h2>

<p>The great historian was trying to unravel the intricacies of an incorrect merge
that had happened many months ago.  He made a pilgrimage to Master Git to ask
for his help.</p>

<p>"Master Git," said the historian, "what is the nature of history?"</p>

<p>"History is immutable.  To rewrite it later is to tamper with the very fabric of
existence."</p>

<p>The historian nodded, then asked: "Is that why rebasing commits that have been
pushed is discouraged?"</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Master Git.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" exclaimed the historian.  "I have a historical record of a merge
commit with two parents.  How can I find out which branch each parent was
originally made on?"</p>

<p>"History is ephemeral," replied Master Git, "the knowledge you seek can be
answered only by the gods."</p>

<p>The historian hung his head as enlightenment crushed down upon him.</p>

<h2 id="s4-the-hobgoblin"><a href="#s4-the-hobgoblin">The Hobgoblin</a></h2>

<p>A novice was learning at the feet of Master Git.  At the end of the lesson he
looked through his notes and said, "Master, I have a few questions.  May I ask
them?"</p>

<p>Master Git nodded.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> tags?"</p>

<p>"<code>git tag</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> remotes?"</p>

<p>"<code>git remote -v</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> branches?"</p>

<p>"<code>git branch -a</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"And how can I view the current branch?"</p>

<p>"<code>git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I delete a remote?"</p>

<p>"<code>git remote rm</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"And how can I delete a branch?"</p>

<p>"<code>git branch -d</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>The novice thought for a few moments, then asked: "Surely some of these could be
made more consistent, so as to be easier to remember in the heat of coding?"</p>

<p>Master Git snapped his fingers.  A hobgoblin entered the room and ate the novice
alive.  In the afterlife, the novice was enlightened.</p>

<h2 id="s5-the-long-and-short-of-it"><a href="#s5-the-long-and-short-of-it">The Long and Short of It</a></h2>

<p>Master Git and a novice were walking along a bridge.</p>

<p>The novice, wanting to partake of Master Git's vast knowledge, said:
"<code>git branch --help</code>".</p>

<p>Master Git sat down and lectured her on the seven forms of <code>git branch</code>, and
their many options.</p>

<p>They resumed walking.  A few minutes later they encountered an experienced
developer traveling in the opposite direction.  He bowed to Master Git and said
"<code>git branch -h</code>".  Master Git tersely informed him of the most common <code>git
branch</code> options.  The developer thanked him and continued on his way.</p>

<p>"Master," said the novice, "what is the nature of long and short options for
commands?  I thought they were equivalent, but when that developer used <code>-h</code> you
said something different than when I said <code>--help</code>."</p>

<p>"Perspective is everything," answered the Master.</p>

<p>The novice was puzzled.  She decided to experiment and said "<code>git -h branch</code>".</p>

<p>Master Git turned and threw himself off the railing, falling to his death on the
rocks below.</p>

<p>Upon seeing this, the novice was enlightened.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-7d26e9b4ac55b229ffd2"><div><p>This August, I started teaching <a href="https://www.modulo.app/manishamodule">a digital learning pod</a> for Kindergarten-2nd grade students. </p><p>When I decided I was going to run an online learning pod, I started thinking about ways to create engaging educational opportunities for kids online. I knew that teaching on an online medium was going to be very different than teaching in a physical classroom.  </p><p>Rather than grumble too much about how much better teaching in-person was, I decided to try to make the most out of my new virtual classroom. They say that <a href="https://reggioemilia2015.weebly.com/environment-as-a-third-teacher.html">the environment is the child’s third teacher</a>. Much like Maria Montessori developed materials to make her classroom environment conducive to learning, I knew I needed to find the best tools possible (software and hardware) to support kids and teachers to optimize this online learning environment for learning. </p><p>Fortunately, many of the parents in my group work in tech, so they were happy to lend a hand and help me problem-solve to make sure their kids had a good experience in the group.</p><p>Teaching a group of Kindergarten-2nd grade students online presented some unique challenges. When we started, it was painfully noisy for all involved, and kids were constantly disappearing -  slipping outside the frame of the camera.  Some younger children are often difficult to understand as is, not to mention with the additional obstacle of having their voices travel through the internet to my computer speaker . The result was that kids were bored and I thought I might lose my mind from the noise. </p><p>We tested dozens of different conferencing platforms, tablets, headphones and other unique devices and software solutions to get our group communicating well online.</p><p>My original goal was to get to a point where we would be able to provide a nice social experience 2x/week for 45 minutes. I told my tech savvy parents I needed to find a way where I could hear the kids whispering across the room, see them lap down or do a jumping jack. It was an ambitious goal, but one month in, we’ve surpassed by expectations.</p><p>Now, by using the right tools, teaching zoom etiquette and choosing activities that translate well to an online environment, I’ve found 4 and 5 year old kids (and even children are young as 3) are begging to stay online 3 hours after class has started! They are moving and jumping around, actively participating in class discussions and making meaningful friendships with other children across the country. </p><p>This is what we’ve found works best to allow lots of movement, engagement and clear sound. (And also helps stop me from getting tired or worn out when I teach)</p><p><strong>Here are the tools I recommend for group learning online:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom for conferencing</a>. Zoom simply does sound and video for groups better than any other platform. </p></li><li><p>*<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gamma-Ray-Trust-Blocking-Glasses/dp/B083ZKY9TH/">Gamma Ray Blue Light Blocking Glasses</a> to prevent eye strain (for teachers)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xenvo-iPhone-Camera-Lens-Clip/dp/B01A6D2JVI/">Xenvo Pro Lens Kit</a> so you can see a large area, kids don’t have to sit still and feel free to move around the room</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro">*Airpod Pro</a> for the best headphones that won’t fall out of small ears when doing jumping jacks, have great sound </p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/">Macbook</a> for zoom&nbsp;and most apps.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nulaxy-Ergonomic-Adjustable-Computer-Compatible/dp/B077B9W343">Nulaxy Laptop Stand</a> to make us look more glamorous when we record sessions (double-chin eliminated!) and also allows kids to stand and move about, not sit still.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://krisp.ai/">Krisp.ai</a> to reduce background noise on zoom</p></li><li><p>If you can also afford an <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro">ipad</a>, please get one because this is best for IOS apps which are amazing to support your children's learning.  The new Ipad pro is best for screen sharing.</p></li></ul><p>I’m privileged to be able to afford the tools to support my teaching. Many of the families in my group are privileged to be able to purchase tools to support their children’s learning. And we’ve been able to purchase devices for those who can’t.  An estimated 22% of US students don’t have access to a single computer to help them learn remotely. This is a travesty and one we’re working around the clock to change through Schoolclosures.org and our <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/givecomputers">Give Computers</a> campaign. </p><p>While I’m excited to share these tools, I’m also outraged and downhearted by the growing divide between rich and poor students due to lack of access to technology. </p><p>If you are on a budget, I strongly recommend investing in an Ipad to cover all your key bases. Generally, your cell phone plan will let you pay for your Ipad on a payment plan. An Amazon kindle will also do. </p><p>Families looking for free hardware or software should apply to <a href="http://www.givecomputers.org/">givecomputers.org</a></p><p>For families who are still struggling to find a device to support their teaching or child’s learning, please contact us so we can give you a hand. We want to help everyone we can to get the technology they need to learn. </p><p>For those looking to go the extra mile, here’s an intro to zoom video I made where I talk in more detail about the hardware I’ve chosen and some tips for beginner teachers on using zoom. </p></div></div></div>]]>

<span>T</span><p>he Cold War flared hot on August 23, 1958, when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Taiwan_Strait_Crisis" target="_blank">Communist China bombarded Matsu and Quemoy,</a> islands of the Nationalist Republic of China (Taiwan). As Red Chinese and American warships faced off in the Formosa Strait, Nationalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-86_Sabre" target="_blank">F-86F Sabres</a> flew against MiG fighters, including the new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiG-17" target="_blank">MiG-17 “Fresco.”</a> Cruising above and beyond the reach of the Sabres’ machine guns—weapons that remained basically unchanged since the dawn of fighter aircraft—Fresco pilots enjoyed not only superior numbers but superior technology.
</p><p>
Or did they? In late September the Sabres took on new, American-supplied weaponry—needle-like, 9-foot-long rockets that were barb-tipped and finned, with delicate glass noses instead of steel warheads. The new rocket had no wires, no radio, no way for the pilot to guide it after launch. Yet it was equipped with movable fins. It could change course. For the Taiwanese pilots the conclusion was inescapable, if unbelievable: The Americans had created a missile that could seek out and destroy the enemy on its own.

<p>From the Allies’ unguided <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Prieur_rocket" target="_blank">Le Prieur</a> of World War I to World War II’s wire-guided German <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhrstahl_X-4" target="_blank">Ruhrstahl X-4</a>, air-to-air rockets had never proven particularly effective. After WWII, air combat was supposed to be all about intercepting nuclear-armed strategic bombers at long range. The experts fancied missiles with radar guidance, though this required launch planes to track and “paint” targets with microwaves throughout attack runs. 
</p><p>
Meanwhile, at the U.S. Naval Ordnance Test Station at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Lake" target="_blank">China Lake</a> in California’s Mojave Desert, a few dozen gadgeteers under physicist William B. McLean were toying with lead-sulfide proximity fuzes that were sensitive to the infrared radiation generated by heat. China Lake’s directive was R&amp;D, not weapon design, and critics derisively referred to his lab as “McLean’s Hobby Shop.” But that didn’t stop his little team from completely revolutionizing air warfare.

<p>
Reasoning that a fuze capable of exploding a warhead near a hot target could also be made to home in on it, McLean sought to put a guidance system entirely onboard a standard 5-inch air-to-ground rocket. With in-house volunteers, miscellaneous funds and spare time—but without official approval—he undertook to develop an intelligent fuze for a heat-seeking air-to-air missile.
</p><p>
It took five years. “I personally spent nearly three years [just] considering possibilities,” McLean later wrote. “It is easy to build something complicated; it’s hard to build it so that it’s simple.” 
</p><p>
The final design was indeed simple: a parabolic mirror spinning gyroscopically at 4,200 rpm inside the rocket’s transparent nose. The distance of an infrared blip’s reflection from the axis of spin indicated its angle-off; current from the centrally mounted lead-sulfide detector kept the “eye” on target via electromagnets around its rim and controlled the missile’s canard guide fins.

Future astronaut <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wally_Schirra" target="_blank">Wally Schirra</a>, then a hotshot Korea veteran with a MiG-15 kill to his credit, remembered his first visit to the lab. The China Lake eggheads had a “dome-shaped device, made of glass….a man-made eyeball,” he recalled. “I was a cigarette smoker in those days, and I had one in my hand. As I crossed the room, I noticed that the eyeball was tracking me.”

Since missile roll would interfere with the gyro’s spin, on the fly McLean’s team invented “rollerons”—tailfin-mounted, airstream-driven gyro wheels whose spin counteracted the missile’s. The crowning touch, however, was wiring the seeker to aim not where the target was, but <i>where it would be.</i> In dogfights the missile itself would take on enemy aircraft on their own terms: seek them out, run them down and outmaneuver them to make the kill. 
This can’t be overstated. More than 60 years ago, back when automobiles were lumbering hunks of Detroit steel, the proto-computer Eniac needed a room full of vacuum tubes merely to calculate ballistic trajectories and the only robots were costumed actors in sci-fi films, what Bill McLean’s China Lake team did—with just 14 tubes and fewer than 24 moving parts, in a package less than 10 feet long, 5 inches across and weighing 160 pounds—was invent fire-and-forget: an autonomous combat robot. They named it Sidewinder, after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crotalus_cerastes" target="_blank">Mojave horned rattlesnake</a>, which stalks its prey by their heat signatures in darkness, and crosses the desert sands with a sinuous, winding motion not unlike the missiles’ corkscrewing trajectory.

</p><div><img src="http://www.donhollway.com/foxtwo/skynight.jpg" width="624" height="375">
<p><b>U.S. Navy Douglas F3D-2 Skyknight (BuNo 123744) fires a Sidewinder 1-C missile at the Naval Weapons Center (NWC) China Lake, California (USA), on 27 June 1961. The escorting plane is a McDonnell F3H-2N Demon (BuNo 133550).</b></p>

<p>
Schirra and other test pilots amused themselves by locking onto not only flying target drones, but also locomotives, tractor-trailers and Greyhound buses near China Lake. Their main complaint, since Sidewinder firing parameters varied with altitude, airspeed and G-load, was having to check a cockpit voltmeter to confirm lock-on: “We’ve got to get something besides the damn gauge. You can’t have a pilot, a fighter pilot in combat, looking [down] at funny little gauges to see if he can fire or not.”
</p><p>
It turned out to be the final piece of the puzzle. Anyone who’s flown a combat flight sim knows the 840 Hz Sidewinder “growl,” indicating missile readiness and target lock. (Newer versions chirp.) This robot doesn’t just think; it talks. 
</p><p>
Just five years later, under the code name <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Taiwan_Strait_Crisis#Overview" target="_blank">“Operation Black Magic,”</a> Americans in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-100_Super_Sabre" target="_blank">F-100 Super Sabres </a>were simulating Red Chinese Frescos, teaching Nationalist pilots “pitch-up” Sidewinder launches against high-altitude targets. The MiG pilots were about to get a nasty surprise.

The final tally depends on which side does the counting, but on a single day, September 24, 1958, the Nationalists’ Sidewinder-equipped Sabres shot down at least 10 Frescos. Two weeks later the People’s Republic sued for peace. Command of the air, and thus the battlefield, had been handed back to the West, courtesy of the Sidewinder. Yet one MiG reportedly returned to base with an unexploded missile still embedded in its wing root. Thus despite the project’s top-secret nature, on its first outing the Sidewinder had been outed.
</p><p>
The Soviets, weapons suppliers to half the world, later admitted that the Sidewinder’s near-biological intelligence was a complete revelation to them. They set about reverse-engineering a copy—the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AA-2_Atoll" target="_blank">K15, NATO code name AA-2 “Atoll”</a>—and devising tactics to defeat heat-seekers.
</p><p>
The Sidewinder, now designated Air Intercept Missile (AIM) 9, proved decisive once again when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Kashmir_War" target="_blank">Pakistan and India went to war for the second time over Kashmir in 1965.</a> The air battle was unique: primarily American versus British and French warplanes. The Pakistanis were outnumbered 5-to-1, but they had Sidewinders.

But before they could make good their escape, Khan used his speed to come back around into a Sidewinder envelope. “I aimed the missile at the nearest aircraft, and heard the loud pitched missile tone,” he recalled. “The sight indicated that I was in range.

<p>Yep, thatâ€™s Rust code with embedded Objective-C syntax, and it works. Why would you do such a thing? Maybe you want tighter interop between the Rust and Objective-C parts of your iOS app. Maybe you want to write your iOS app <em>entirely</em> in Rust. Or maybe you just wanted to see if it was possible after your <a href="https://twitter.com/porglezomp">colleague</a>â€™s offhand remark.</p>

<p>(For me, it was the last one, absolutely.)</p>

<p>This post is going to walk through what it took to make this possible, so hereâ€™s a table of contents:</p>

<p>Sections 3-5 might actually be useful to other people looking to write Rust macros, so even though this project is a toy, you may still get something out of reading the post. However, if youâ€™re looking to use Objective-C from Rust in production, you should not be using my unsafe toy here. Instead, use Steven Sheldonâ€™s <a href="https://crates.io/crates/objc"><code>objc</code> crate</a>. Sheldon also has a blog post from near the start of the project that talks about <a href="https://sasheldon.com/blog/2014/11/28/interoperating-between-objective-c-and-rust/">his design process beyond the bare message-send implementation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="background-on-objective-c">Background on Objective-C</h2>

<p>My normal audience these days is probably Swift developers, but I expect this one to make rounds with at least some Rust people as well. Itâ€™d be easy for both groups to not have much direct experience with Objective-C, the primary language used by Apple for both macOS<sup id="fnref:osx" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:osx">1</a></sup> and iOS since their releases in 2001 and 2007. So, hereâ€™s the quick summary: itâ€™s â€œjustâ€� C, except when you start working with â€œobjectâ€� types. And nearly everything you do with those objects is based on a dynamic dispatch model implemented in the <em>runtime.</em> Because of the two parts of that sentence (â€œdynamic dispatchâ€� and â€œimplemented in the runtimeâ€�), people have come up with a lot of clever and powerful techniques to make programs simpler, more expressive, or more extensible, though sometimes at the cost of security, secrecy, and stability.</p>

<p>More relevant to us, however, is that a language whose features are (nearly) all available in a runtime library is a language thatâ€™s easy to bridge to dynamically, as long as you donâ€™t have really tight performance constraints. So hereâ€™s the deal: nearly everything you do in Objective-C is calling methods by <em>sending messages,</em> and the way this works is that methods are regular C functions stored in a dispatch table keyed by a uniqued string called a <dfn>selector</dfn>. It is likely that the most heavily-optimized piece of code in Appleâ€™s libraries is <code>objc_msgSend</code>, which takes a <dfn>receiver</dfn>, a selector, and the arguments to the method, does a (cached) lookup of the selector in the receiverâ€™s classâ€™s dispatch table(s), and then jumps directly to the appropriate, polymorphically-selected implementation of the method.</p>

<p>There are more things the Objective-C runtime exposes, but messages are absolutely the most important.</p>

<p>â€¦Oh, one more thing. Because Objective-C is an extension to C, it has to use syntax that doesnâ€™t conflict with C syntax. That means keywords with <code>@</code> signs in front of themâ€”one of the few symbols on the US keyboard that doesnâ€™t already have a meaning in Câ€”and a unique bracket-based â€œmessage sendâ€� syntax that takes a while to get used to:</p>

<pre><code>// Objective-C
NSString *fileStr = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:fileContents encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

// Pseudo-Swift
let fileStr: NSString = NSString.alloc().initWithData(fileContents, encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding)

// Actual Swift
let fileStr = NSString(data: fileContents, encoding: .utf8)

// Pseudo-Rust
let fileStr: *const NSString = NSString::alloc().initWithData(fileContents, NSUTF8StringEncoding)

// Idiomatic-ish Rust
let file_str = NSString::from_data(file_contents, NSStringEncoding::UTF8)
</code></pre>

<p>People almost universally think Objective-C syntax is ugly when they first see it, almost universally find it completely normal after a few years, and largely (though <em>not</em> almost universally) find idiomatic Swift easier to read even if theyâ€™re used to Objective-C.</p>

<h2 id="objective-c-from-rust-manually">Objective-C from Rust, manually</h2>

<p>From this point on youâ€™ll be expected to read Rust syntax without step-by-step explanations. Iâ€™ll try to explain whatâ€™s going on for my Swift and other non-Rust readersâ€”I myself am still a relative newcomer to Rustâ€”but itâ€™ll be pretty fast. This is <em>not</em> intended to be an introduction to Rust or Rust macros!</p>

<p>Given that the Objective-C runtime exposes a public API, we should be able to pretty much just call that from Rust, and indeed we can:</p>

<p>Now, this code should make most Rust users pretty horrified. It starts out okay, declaring some types and then declaring the Rust versions of the C API from libobjc. Then itâ€™s got a funny empty extern block to link the Foundation framework, but sure, thatâ€™s fine. And itâ€™s got explicitly-null-terminated strings because thatâ€™s what C-based APIs generally use. (Rust doesnâ€™t guarantee null termination by default, which makes slicing a Rust string easier.)</p>

<p>But then thereâ€™s a monstrosity of a line involving <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.transmute.html"><code>std::mem::transmute</code></a>, Rustâ€™s equivalent of Swiftâ€™s <code>unsafeBitCast(_:)</code> or C++â€™s <code>reinterpret_cast</code> (and now <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/bit_cast"><code>bit_cast</code></a>) or Câ€™sâ€¦well, okay, C doesnâ€™t have a direct equivalent, but a plain old cast when youâ€™re talking about function pointers like this. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.transmute.html">docs for <code>transmute</code></a> even tell you to go use other things if possible.</p>

<p>So, what are we doing? Well, remember what I said about Objective-C and <code>objc_msgSend</code>: methods are regular C functions, and <code>objc_msgSend</code> â€œjumps directly to the appropriate, polymorphically-selected implementation of the methodâ€�. That means that the correct way to call <code>objc_msgSend</code> is to <em>pretend it has the right type for the method youâ€™re calling.</em></p>

<p>In C (and Swift, for that matter), that conversion would require explicitly specifying the type of all arguments and return values. But Rust has really powerful type inference within a function body, and that extends to specifying only <em>some</em> generic parameters, and leaving others out.<sup id="fnref:swift-inference" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:swift-inference">2</a></sup> In this case I need to specify that weâ€™re casting to a C function pointer with two arguments and a non-void return, but not anything more than that. The remaining information will be filled in based on how the function pointer is used.</p>

<p>With that, you should understand the (cursed) code above. Go ahead. Try it on your own machine (if your machine is a Mac).</p>

<h2 id="recursive-rust-macros">Recursive Rust macros</h2>

<p>Rust has a pretty robust macro system, so it wouldnâ€™t be impossible or even too hard to make a macro for â€œmessage sendâ€�. Thatâ€™s the route that the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/objc"><code>objc</code> crate</a> takes:</p>

<div><pre><code><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>url_class</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>NSURL</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>description_obj</span>: <span>*</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>Object</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>msg_send</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>url_class</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>description</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>utf8_ptr</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>msg_send</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>description_obj</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>UTF8String</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>CStr</span>::<span>from_ptr</span><span>(</span><span>utf8_ptr</span><span>).</span><span>to_string_lossy</span><span>());</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But while thatâ€™s clearly the right choice for serious Rust work, I wanted something more ambitious. More integrated. Moreâ€¦ridiculous.</p>

<p>What I wanted was for Objective-Câ€™s messaging syntax, or something like it, to be valid anywhere in Rust code. It didnâ€™t have to be exactly Objective-C, but I quickly realized the <em>advantage</em> of Objective-Câ€™s syntax: itâ€™s delimited, i.e. itâ€™s a self-contained expression that can be dropped into something larger without changing how that larger thing parses. (Thatâ€™s probably why itâ€™s bracketed in C as well.) Within the brackets, thereâ€™s basically two forms:</p>

<pre><code>[receiver-expr no-arg-selector]
[receiver-expr selector-piece:arg-expr selector-piece:second-arg-expr...]
</code></pre>

<p>If I were <em>just</em> matching that, I could use Rustâ€™s original <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html#declarative-macros-with-macro_rules-for-general-metaprogramming">pattern-matching macros</a>. But to take a whole block of code, and replace everything that looks like a message lock <em>in</em> that blockâ€¦well, it might be possible with pattern-matching and quite a bit of recursion, but itâ€™s going to be a lot easier to use <em><a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/21/Procedural-Macros-in-Rust-2018.html">procedural macros</a>,</em> a Rust macro interface written in Rust and used as a compiler plugin. (Swift folks, basically what <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax">SwiftSyntax</a> allows you to do, but invoked on-demand during compilation.)</p>
