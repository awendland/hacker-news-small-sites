December 1, 2020 | https://www.netnod.se/time-and-frequency/white-paper-how-does-nts-work-and-why-is-it-important | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.netnod.se/time-and-frequency/white-paper-how-does-nts-work-and-why-is-it-important">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>This white paper gives an overview of NTS and a detailed description of the authentication process that ensures you receive time information from a trusted source. This includes the step-by-step details of the key establishment and time stamping process. We also provide a summary of the elements that enable NTS to scale and to secure NTP against a range of attack vectors.</p><div><h2>This is a preview of Netnod's NTS white paper. To read&nbsp;the full white paper, see link below.
</h2><p>Introduction
</p><p>Many of the important security tools that keep us safe online depend on accurate time. But until recently there was no way to ensure that the time you received over the Internet was correct. There was simply no way to tell if you were being fed time from a malicious or trusted source.</p>
<p>This is largely because the current standard for receiving time over the Internet, the Network Time Protocol (NTP), was created in 1985. In those more innocent times, the need to secure NTP, the type of security needed, and how to provide it were less understood.</p>
<p>Over the last 35 years, a range of security flaws and some high-profile attacks have shown that NTP needed significantly improved security. The new Network Time Security (NTS) standard has been designed to fix that.</p>
<p><span><strong>NTP security issues&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>Unsecured NTP is vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks where a malicious actor sits between you and the NTP server, listens in on the conversation, forges&nbsp; messages and lies to you about time. As a lot of processes are dependent on accurate time, the consequences here can be very serious and can include:</p>
<ul><li>Incorrect timestamps on logs and transactions which can support fraudulent activities or help disguise other criminal action&nbsp;</li>
<li>Authentication problems, attacks and issues with authentication security measures&nbsp;</li>
<li>Issues with cryptographic signatures and establishing encrypted sessions such as Transport Layer Security (TLS)&nbsp;</li>
<li>DNS Security (DNSSEC) failing to work if the client doesn’t have accurate time</li>
</ul><p><span><strong>Previous attempts at NTP security&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>There have been some previous attempts to add security to NTP. Commonly referred to as NTP-AUTH, these attempts did not provide all necessary aspects of security (confidentiality, authentication and integrity including protection against replay attacks).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, the underlying security mechanism for NTP-AUTH (MD5 or SHA-1) could be considered weak at best. NTP-AUTH is based on secret keys but the key agreement is not standardized. This means that any NTP service provider wanting to use NTP-AUTH has to find their own way to exchange keys with the client out-of-band.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This often requires a potential client to send a letter or fax to get the secret key. The need for a server to store uniquesecret keys for all clients creates scalability problems: as the number of users grows, the storage requirements and especially the ability to rapidly look up a given key makes the service hard to scale.</p>
<p>Given all these issues, it has long been apparent that a new security mechanism for NTP is needed; one based on modern security mechanisms that could also allow the service to scale to potentially millions of clients.</p>
<h2><strong>The NTS standard</strong></h2>
<p>NTS has been developed within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). In March 2015, the first Internet-Draft of the NTS standard was published. Over the next five years, the draft went through 28 further iterations until the Internet Draft ‘Network Time Security for the Network Time Protocol’ was published as a Proposed Standard (RFC8915) in September 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NTS uses modern cryptography to add an important layer of security to NTP. It prevents spoofing and MITM attacks by using authenticated packets. Amplification attacks are prevented by ensuring that request and response packets are always the same size.</p>
<p>NTS is really two protocols: a key establishment protocol, and NTP with some new Extension Fields. The reason for using two protocols is separation of concerns:</p>
<p>1. The seldom used key establishment on top of standard Transport Layer Security (TLS), and</p>
<p>2. The (already existing) low latency UDP-based time synchronisation path.</p>
<p>This means that the existing NTP functionality is the same as before, but the time data can now be authenticated.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>The NTS authentication process</strong></h2>
<p>The authentication process consists of a key establishment and a timestamp request. The key exchange server typically runs on an ordinary computer, but the slim NTS-enabled NTP server is UDP-based and stateless. It can be served from anycast addresses and can be implemented at the hardware level. The NTP server’s state about each client is kept in the cookie provided by the client itself with each request. As there can potentially be hundreds of millions of clients, this is crucial for the smooth operation of a large-scale NTS service.</p>
<p>Since the cryptographic operations in the NTS path are symmetric it is both easier to implement them in hardware and to make them use constant time. This increases the accuracy of the time synchronisation and keeps the slower key exchange outside of the time synchronisation path.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NTS uses Authenticated Encryption using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), more specifically what is known as Synthetic Initialization Vector (RFC 5297). This is a block cipher mode of operation providing nonce-based,&nbsp;misuse-resistant authenticated encryption. Using AES-SIV enables the encryption processes described below to add integrity and origin authentication. The consequences for this at a hardware level will be discussed in an upcoming&nbsp;white paper.</p>
<p><span><strong>The key establishment</strong></span></p>
<p>The key establishment process works as follows: first, a client initiates a key establishment using the NTS-KE protocol embedded in TLS (see figure 1.)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>I’ve been part of the internet startup scene for a while. There are so many different camps: the bootstrappers, the VC-backed tech-bros, the crypto “investors”, the people marketing their courses on marketing courses, the newsletter gurus, the micro-saas homeboys. The list goes on.</p>
<p>Each of these groups have their own, unique views on building companies and products. Some are moonshots, others are sustainable “grow-slowly” types, and each has its own subset of hard-core, flame-war inducing followers. Ah, the internet is a beautiful, terrible, magical, ghastly, colourful place.</p>
<p>I’ve been associated with, and in some cases, been a part of a few of these various subcultures. After working at a VC backed startup, I went the bootstrapped route (popularised by the IndieHackers movement) with my own product. It was an interesting ride, but was still rife with the Marketing Course Joes who just made $3000 last week with their “How to market no-code apps” course, as well as the Hustle Boys with their Twitter feeds full of “Work like no-one works today, so you can live like no-one lives tomorrow. #entrepreneur”. Neither of these resonated with me.</p>
<p>I have found my own analogy/ideology. My product is my garden.</p>
<p>During the early days of lockdown, my girlfriend got deep into gardening. She would spend hours nurturing her tomato plants, weeding, watering, puttering about. She would spend afternoons reading articles on permaculture, figuring out which plants grew well alongside other plants. Lavender with tomatoes kept the pests away, slight shade for the granadilla vine, some water, but not too much for the root vegetables. It was lovely to watch her coax tasty and nutritious food individually out of the ground. I can’t imagine full-scale farming being nearly as enjoyable.</p>
<p>That’s what I want from my products. I want to putter about, feel connected to the process, and have fun doing so. I want to make things that don’t scale. To see people tuck into them and enjoy them as people, not as stats. I’ve done this fairly successfully with <a href="https://justsketch.me/">JustSketchMe</a>. We have a small, diverse, and amazing community of artists and illustrators making awesome things. I’m trying to build a similar product with <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear Blog</a>. Something niche but valuable. Something I can spend time on because I want to.</p>
<p>Being able to talk to, and interact with the people using my tools is fulfilling. Spending time meticulously improving subtle aspects of the product is enjoyable.</p>
<p>Obviously, to do this a product has to reach a basic threshold of profitability. This will differ depending on where you are. I live in Cape Town, South Africa where the cost of living is low (compared to the US and EU). I reached basic profitability, matching an average developer salary here, about 10 months ago, and since then I’ve been improving my projects. Not to grow at all cost, but to ensure that people using the tool have an ever-improving experience.</p>
<p>This is my garden, and I intend to putter.</p>

    <p>As technology advances, we are distracted by more things than ever, and it is getting harder to draw a strict line between work and free time. There are several time management techniques offering help to make ourselves more effective while working. One of the most acknowledged among them is the Pomodoro technique. The best approach is to download a Pomodoro timer app, so we help you below to navigate the solution landscape.</p>

<p>As I take a look around my desk, while writing this article, I see at least a dozen physical and virtual elements that distract me. Working from home office during the quarantine did even amplify my inner voices saying: “Chat with your friends instead.”, “That email could be extremely important!”, “Aren’t you hungry?”</p>
<p>Time management issues are among the hottest topics when it comes to organizing work. The above distractions cost the global economy billions of dollars as, according to a recent study, almost 80% of an average workday is spent on activities with low value. Distractions, poor prioritization, procrastination lead to in-effective days and longer-than-needed workdays.</p>
<p><strong>The Pomodoro technique</strong> is a method with a single goal in mind: giving a valid, realistic timeframe in which you can focus, while also allowing you to have regular, yet controlled breaks. Pomodoro is a time management method invented by Italian gentleman Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s. It was named after a tomato-shaped timer used in the kitchen working with 25-minute time intervals, the predecessor of today’s Pomodoro timer app solutions. The essence of the Pomodoro technique is to do only one task intensively and focused for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. Then work again for 25 minutes and break again for 5 minutes. After every fourth Pomodoro-interval, take a longer break of 20-30 minutes.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that you can’t sip a cup of coffee during a 25-minute long Pomodoro, rather be prepared with that coffee beforehand, so that you wouldn’t need to get up your chair and with it fall out from the rhythm and paste you were just picking up.</p>
<h2>What makes this technique so powerful?</h2>
<div>
<div>
    <h3>Pomodoro is designed to be easy to start with</h3>
    <p>You do not need to populate page-long matrixes, nor estimate all the work for the whole week. It cannot be simpler! There are Pomodoro timer app solutions that don’t even require registration, making it super-easy to kick-off.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>It helps to avoid multitasking</h3>
    <p>Continuous task-switching, regardless of how good you are in multitasking, heavily affects performance. A study by researcher Laura Bowman at Central Connecticut State University sheds light on what happens during a nowadays standard example of task-switching. Students who used Facebook Messenger while reading a textbook took 25% longer to read the same part (excluding time spent on chatting) than students who only used their time reading. The results clearly showed that the quality of performance deteriorates when concentrating on multiple tasks “simultaneously”.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>It helps battling procrastination</h3>
    <p>Studies show that breaking down tasks to the smallest possible parts helps the brain to see them as easy-to-solve tasks, which eventually will hold back procrastination tendencies.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>It also helps your body</h3>
    <p>Just use part of the 5-min long pauses to move and flex your back, hip, arms, and legs. Changing the focus distance of your eyes once in a while, aka not looking at your monitor constantly, also helps to keep them healthier. </p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Making good use of the Pomodoro technique</h2>
<p>Here are a few tips on how to nurture this technique to achieve your best self.</p>
<div>
<div>
    <h3>Use to-do lists</h3>
    <p>Pomodoro is not simply about pushing a timer or using an app: the number one rule to this technique is to have well-prepared tasks at hand. If you have larger projects, break them down into the smallest parts that you can do. An example: writing an article is a complex project with a lot of research and creative penning. Putting simply “writing an article” on the to-do list is ineffective because it is hard to know how much time and what resources are needed. If you break it down into smaller elements like researching the topic, finding statistics, writing a catchy intro, etc. - that helps your brain to see the big picture and prioritize correctly.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Organize your tasks into pomodoros (tomatoes)</h3>
    <p>These little tomato timeframes should include as many tasks you can handle in a 25-minute long round. The experience will make you better at estimating the right amounts, however, you can do an educated guess if you have done the project breakdown correctly.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Focus, focus, and focus</h3>
    <p>Your 25-minute long Pomodoros should be done with only one thing in mind: finishing your tasks. This might sound too strict at first, but these timeframes are designed in the exact length of an average worker’s/student’s concentration capacity in mind. No emails, no Messenger, and other chats, only your favorite music and the tasks you prepared for yourself.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Applications and websites that support you along the journey</h2>
<p>After the theory, let’s see how the above can be put into practice. While Francesco Cirillo had fewer distractions back in his day, he did not have a Pomodoro technique app to help him focus. Today’s solutions are much more than simple timers. Let’s see what apps out there you can leverage.</p>
<h3>1. <a href="https://www.forestapp.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forest app</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/Forest-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/Forest-logo.png" alt="Forest logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> This application helps you to stay focused and introduces a gamified approach of planting and growing trees. If you start working and use your phone in a non-related way (eg. open Messenger), you get a waring. If you keep switching back from your tasks to less important distractions, your tree will stop growing and will eventually dry out. You are free to set the time frame for how long you want to focus between 10 and 120 minutes. After each period is completed, you receive coins in proportion to how long you have not used your phone. (From which you can buy beautiful trees that are just waiting to be grown.)</p>
<p>Moreover, if you are persistent enough, you can plant a real tree in a designated place, which can be a real motivating force. You can listen to the background noise of a Parisian café or a sandy beach to help to focus.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with Pomodoro:</strong> Setting up 25-minute long intervals in Forest will just do the trick. However, measuring quick breaks and long pauses are not yet available. Still, if you are looking for a great Pomodoro timer app, that helps you focus and forces you - in a gamified way - to do so, Forest is a wonderful choice.</p>
<h3>2. <a href="https://www.flatpomodoro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flat Tomato</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/FlatTomato-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/FlatTomato-logo.png" alt="FlatTomato logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOs, macOS</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> This Mac- and iOS-only application is crafted to fulfill every need of a Pomodoro-er. Wonderful design with easy-to-use interfaces supports you along your day of study and work. You can set tasks, start timers for the different intervals and you can also listen to ambient music and background noises, such as ocean waves, to support your focus. And what makes it a top-ranked, best Pomodoro app? It offers smart reports and analytics to understand what you have done, which, to be honest, gives quite the satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with Pomodoro:</strong> The app’s core is the Pomodoro technique, and all its features are designed with that in mind.</p>
<h3>3. <a href="https://www.focustodo.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Focus To-do</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/FocusToDo-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/FocusToDo-logo.png" alt="FocusToDo logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android, macOS, Windows</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> At first, Focus To-Do seems similar to Flat Tomato and at its core, they both are to help you nurture the Pomodoro technique. However, Focus To-Do offers a complete platform to set up different tasks with categorization, prioritization capabilities. By standard Pomodoro and task management can be done via two different solutions using integrations, Focus To-Do offers them under one umbrella.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with Pomodoro:</strong> You will be able to break down your tasks into small pomodoros and organize them throughout your day. This is by far the best Pomodoro technique app if you are looking for an all-in-one solution.</p>
<h3>4. <a href="https://www.focusboosterapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Focus Booster</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/FocusBooster-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/FocusBooster-logo.png" alt="FocusBooster logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> web, iOS, Android, macOS, Windows</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> This solution is close to its competitor, Flat Tomato, but is available on all platforms, including on the web via a browser. Its features are centered on the Pomodoro technique. You can set timers, do the intervals and breaks, and review your data after your session on a minimalist, yet beautiful user interface.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with Pomodoro:</strong> One of the best solutions to utilize the Pomodoro technique as it is easy-to-setup and affordable.</p>
<h3>5. <a href="https://pomofocus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pomofocus</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/Pomofocus-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/Pomofocus-logo.png" alt="Pomofocus logo"></picture> <strong>Platform:</strong> web</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> The most straightforward and minimalistic approach to measure your intervals. You can make the best out of it even as a guest, but then you won't be able to see your results in well-organized charts. If you need to quickly set up your Pomodoro infrastructure, this is the best solution.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with Pomodoro:</strong> Stripped down to its very core is by far the most intuitive Pomodoro solution. No app, no install - use it simply by accessing their website and allowing your browser to notify you.</p>
<h2>What makes a Pomodoro application and website effective?</h2>
<div>
<div>
    <h3>Easy-to-use</h3>
    <p>Any apps should be intuitive to be picked up by users, but it especially stands for solutions meant to make our lives easier. Imagine a software that takes away your time to make you able to get a better performer.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Integrations</h3>
    <p>Managing complex projects nowadays require several software solutions to use and the best way to utilize them is via integrations. Data shared between these apps makes your life so much easier.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Reporting</h3>
    <p>Analytics is key not just for your boss to see your performance, but to show results for yourself. It provides satisfaction to see all the tasks you’ve accomplished.</p>

Made in Japan in 2005</figcaption></figure>
<p>Today, I would like to show something different, than usual reverse-engineering, that appears on my blog usually. I needed to prepare a Linux distro for myself to be able to run it on my PC. But not the ordinary operating system that we download from webpage, then use fancy graphical installer to select, what we want and where. My goals were very specific. First was to have it custom-compiled. With that in mind there aren’t many choices left (maybe Gentoo?). Second was to not cross 16 MiB boundary. Why exactly that? That’s simple. I have old (15 years old to be precise) SD/MMC card made for Canon of exactly that size. Quick check showed me that this is possible. I tried buildroot and it failed to fulfill second requirement and I decided not to continue, despite the obvious optimizations on kernel modules, I could do. It’s simply too complex for such a simple task. If not buildroot, then let’s go and see how to do such thing from scratch!</p>

<p>Basically the plan is to have custom Linux distro compiled from scratch. It may sound like something incredibly complex and hard to do. But it’s not. There are just few problems one must learn on how to overcome. The most problematic constraint in my case is, obviously, 16 MiB limit. To not exceed it, I have to use busybox as my userspace. This by the way simplifies distro development significantly. Busybox works the way, that, if linked statically, requires only one, single binary to be able to work correctly. So, to sum up, on software side, we need Linux and busybox. You may wonder, how do I want to boot that system, then? Well. I said I need Linux 🙂 Maybe some people know, some does not, that Linux is itself a boot loader of some kind. At least, when using UEFI and this is what I want to use, it can be loaded directly by UEFI firmware. But that’s another thing to note – I will describe a way to prepare a distro for UEFI – it won’t be as simple as that, for legacy BIOS.</p>
<p>The whole plan will look as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get compiler</li>
<li>Compile Linux kernel</li>
<li>Compile busybox (statically and stripped!)</li>
<li>Prepare initramfs with whole userspace</li>
<li>Format drive as EFI System Partition</li>
<li>Combine kernel and initramfs into single binary</li>
<li>Optionally sign the binary, in case we want Secure Boot to be enabled</li>
<li>Add entry to embedded UEFI boot manager</li>
</ol>
<p>In the meantime, I am going to show few ways to debug the system, in case of any problems.<span id="more-1624"></span></p>

<p>This is maybe not so obvious, but you need new compiler. Most likely, you could use the one that your distro provides, aliased as simply gcc. But this way, you will by the way use glibc as your standard library. For a lightweight system, glibc does not fit well, as this is most heavyweight libc, we have available. Therefore, I will use uClibc. And for that, we need a compiler. Or, to be precise, a toolchain. A toolchain, consisting of kernel headers, uClibc and gcc. Here, I could show, how to build such thing from scratch. But it’s not a tutorial about building a toolchain. This requires knowledge that can fill another tutorial. Instead, I will use the toolchain prepared by my latest project – <a href="https://github.com/v3l0c1r4pt0r/cc-factory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cc-factory</a>. For those, who did not read <a href="https://re-ws.pl/2020/10/meet-cc-factory-a-factory-for-cross-compilers/">my previous post</a>, it is toolchain factory running in Docker container, that provides a recipe for a toolchain that just works. If you tried compiling a toolchain from scratch in the past, then you know that this can fail, even if you use crosstool-ng. With cc-factory, it works as long as Docker can start a service and has Docker Hub working. But enough of that. In cc-factory, I am experimenting with releasing binary distributions of my toolchain. And <a href="https://github.com/v3l0c1r4pt0r/cc-factory/releases/tag/x86_64-gcc10.2.0-linux5.9.13-uclibc1.0.36-1">newest one</a> is special-made for this job. You can simply download it to you disk with:</p>
<pre>wget <span>'</span><span>https://github.com/v3l0c1r4pt0r/cc-factory/releases/download/x86_64-gcc10.2.0-linux5.9.13-uclibc1.0.36-1/x86_64-gcc10.2.0-linux5.9.13-uclibc1.0.36-1.tar.gz</span><span>'</span>
</pre>
<p>After that, you have to install it to your <code>/opt</code> directory with:</p>
<pre>tar <span>-xvf</span> x86_64-gcc10.<span>2</span>.0-linux5.<span>9</span>.13-uclibc1.<span>0</span>.36-1.tar.gz <span>-C</span> /
</pre>
<p>If you prefer another installation path, then head onto cc-factory project to see, how to build one from source. Then, you can choose whatever path, you like for this SDK.</p>
<p>Next step is to export SDK’s bin directory to you PATH for convenience:</p>
<pre><span>export</span> <span>PATH</span>=<span>"</span><span>$PATH</span><span>:/opt/x86_64-linux-uclibc/bin</span><span>"</span>
</pre>
<p>Now, it’s nice to check, if toolchain works. Let’s write one-liner C hello world program to your temp directory, compile and run:</p>
<pre><span>echo</span><span> -e </span><span>'</span><span>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nint main() {printf("Hello, World!\\n");}</span><span>'</span> <span>&gt;</span>/tmp/main.c
x86_64-linux-uclibc-gcc <span>-static</span> <span>-o</span> /tmp/main /tmp/main.c
/tmp/main
</pre>
<p>And you should see the familiar text on your screen. You are ready to go!</p>

<p>That is, in my opinion, the easiest part. First, we have to download kernel image, that we want to use. For that purpose, we need to go to <a href="https://www.kernel.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kernel Archives</a> and download latest stable tarball. Optionally, we can download PGP signature and verify its correctness. But this is outside the scope of this tutorial. Another option to get kernel is to clone its stable repo with:</p>
<pre>git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git
</pre>
<p>This is the path, I chose, because I don’t like leaving multiple copies of kernel sources on my hard drive, so I prefer to have one, central clone of repo and use for any project, I need it to.</p>
<p>In case of tarball, it now has to be unpacked with usual:</p>
<pre>tar <span>-xvf</span> linux-*.tar.gz
</pre>
<p>Then, in case of tarball, you got directory with name dependent on you kernel version, in case of git repo, it is simply linux. So we can cd into it, in any of the above cases:</p>
<pre><span>cd</span> linux*
</pre>
<p>In theory at this point, we could set the compiler, we prepared to be run by kernel buildsystem. But this is optional, as we target <code>x86_64</code> platform, that we run our host on, so default compiler should be as good as uClibc variant. I case, you want to use custom one, you have to export the following:</p>
<pre><span>export</span> <span>CROSS_COMPILE</span>=x86_64-linux-uclibc-
</pre>
<p>Now, we have to configure our kernel.</p>
<p>First step is to choose defconfig. Possible values can be listed in case of x86 with:</p>
<pre><span>ls</span> arch/x86/configs/
</pre>
<p>At the time of writing this returned the following options:</p>
<pre>i386_defconfig tiny.config x86_64_defconfig xen.config
</pre>
<p>As you can see, there are only a few. So, we do:</p>
<pre>make x86_64_defconfig
</pre>
<p>At this point, we are ready to compile. In case, you want to do some modifications, you could do:</p>
<pre>make menuconfig
</pre>
<p>And select (or deselect) some options there. If you think, you are ready, you can type:</p>
<pre>make <span>-j</span>
</pre>
<p>And wait couple of minutes (up to half an hour), depending on speed of your PC. Afterwards, you should see that <code>bzImage</code> has been made and is available at <code>arch/x86/boot/bzImage</code>. We can copy it somewhere in order to not accidentally start its recompilation:</p>
<pre>cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage ../
</pre>
<h2>Testing on hardware</h2>
<p>At this point, it is possible to run the kernel on our system. If you don’t have Secure Boot enabled, then you can try to copy the kernel to you EFI System Partition (wherever it is, I will call this path <code>ESP</code> from now on). But first create new directory for your distro:</p>
<pre><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> ESP/EFI/linux
cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage ESP/EFI/linux/linuxx64.efi
</pre>
<p>I am changing the name in the meantime, as I heard that some systems does not like binaries without <code>.efi</code> extension. Now, we can try to boot.There is more than one way to do it. The one that works always is to utilize EFI firmware directly. But this one differs significantly between manufacturers, so if you prefer that one, please refer to his support pages. The other is to use one of existing tools. For sure KeyTool, that manages Secure Boot keys, is able to start any executable from ESP by browsing the filesystem. But the way I would like to show is, by using so called EFI shell. Why? Because EFI shell allows us to experiment with kernel parameters, by simply typing them, as we would start new user program. And, in fact, from EFI perspective, we simply start a new program.</p>
<p>There are many shells in the wild. I tried EDK2, that is available on Arch as <code>edk2-shell</code> package. It is then available at <code>/usr/share/edk2-shell/x64/Shell.efi</code> You can simply copy it to <code>ESP</code>, just like with kernel, then you have to add it to your EFI boot manager, or use boot manager that is able to autodetect it. You can find a bunch of resources on how to do it, even from inside Linux. But, please do not add the kernel, you copied in such way, to boot manager, as we will play with it a bit, later. Now, in EFI shell, you will be presented with a list of partitions, that the shell has detected. This might be not so obvious at first, but, somehow, you have to identify the one, that is you EFI partition. You should see a similar numbering to the one you see in Linux console, when you list with e.g. <code>lsblk</code>. You can try guessing it by typing its name, in similar way as in Windows, e.g.:</p>
<pre>FS0:
</pre>
<p>to switch to <code>FS0</code> partition. Then you can simply type ls to list its content. Once, you found the right one, it’s worth to remember it, as you might need it couple of times. How many, depends on how many problems, you would have.</p>
<p>Then go to the directory, where you copied your kernel:</p>
<pre><span>cd</span> EFI\linux
</pre>
<p>And ls to make sure, it is there. Now, we are ready to call it:</p>
<pre>linuxx64.efi
</pre>
<p>Yes. It’s as simple as that. But this will fail. We did not provide any root filesystem for our kernel, so it will gonna panic. But don’t worry, as long as reason of the panic is like that:</p>
<pre>not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
</pre>
<p>then it was expected. In case of any other error, act accordingly, as this may be hardware dependent. So, probably, something has to be reconfigured in menuconfig.</p>
<h2>Testing in qemu</h2>
<p>It’s quite a nice option to be able to test your work on real hardware. However, in my opinion, it is much easier to do it in virtualized environment, that you can quickly reset at any time and where you would have latest binaries for testing, all the time, without wasting time for flashing them somewhere. Therefore I recommend to prepare qemu as such environment.</p>
<p>For that, you will need …</p></div></article></div>

Every day until December 24th you will get an article, video or other functional programming related content that hopefully will make the waiting feel a bit shorter! 😄</p>
</section><article><section><p>As previous years the articles will span a large range of topics and complexity. If you are looking for something beginner friendly, or more advanced topics, there should be something for everyone these next 23 days.</p>
<p>Let’s start this advent of with a look at the basics: what is functional programming (FP)? This question has been answered many times before, in many different ways. <a href="https://functional.christmas/2019/1">We took our own stab at it last year</a>. Even though there are no single definition for FP and many different ways to approach it, there are some things that are shared throughout the related communities.</p>

<p>Today I want to use the words and pictures of Russ Olsen and highlight his talk from GOTO 2018. Russ is a great communicator and I love the down to earth and practical perspective he brings in this talk. He explains functional programming in an understandable way and shows why people prefer FP. I hope you enjoy! </p>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          The QEMU Advent Calendar 2020 features a QEMU disk image each day of
          December until the 24th. Each day a new package becomes available
          for download.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every download contains a little 'run' shell script that starts the
          QEMU emulator with the recommended parameters for the disk image.
          Disk images are either contained directly in the download or are
          downloaded by the 'run' script (you need to have installed 'curl' or
          'wget' in that case).
        </p>
        <p>
          The disk images contain interesting operating systems and software
          that run under the QEMU emulator. Some of them are well-known or
          not-so-well-known operating systems, old and new, others are custom
          demos and neat algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 'run' scripts (and disk images if included in the download)
          were created by volunteers from the QEMU community to showcase cool
          software that QEMU can run.

  </figure><p>To set up your work environment for success, you need to reduce distractions.</p><ul><li><strong>Close Apps you are not using.</strong> I use an app called <a href="https://marco.org/apps" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Quitter</a> by Marco Arment. It lets you set up rules to close your apps after a set amount of time of it being inactive.</li><li><strong>Organize your files and folders.</strong> It’s a good idea to try to keep projects isolated to their own folder so they are easier to find. <em>I plan to write more about this one in a later article</em>.</li><li><strong>Tweak your notifications.</strong> If you can get away with turning on Do Not Disturb on your computer, this will be the most effective. But if you are expected to be prompt to slack messages and emails this may be a bit more tricky.</li><li><strong>Block distracting websites.</strong> Taking a 5-minute break on reddit can lead to you looking at cats that like loafs of bread an hour later. For Mac, there is a great app called <a href="https://selfcontrolapp.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Self Control</a> that lets you block certain websites for a set amount of time. The best part is that it’s very hard to get around this filer.</li><li><strong>Buy a good pair of noise-canceling headphones</strong> and find some music that helps you get into a flow state. I have a pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HVLUR86/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ATH-M50x</a> that have been my loyal choice for over 5 years (Not Sponsored <em>yet</em>). Music is one of the most underrated tools for programmers.</li></ul><h2 id="organize-your-tasks">Organize your tasks!</h2><p>For organizing tasks, it's useful to stick to analog. Yes, analog. I bet you thought this was going to be about cool apps huh? Nope, let me introduce you to this cool little thing called Bullet Journaling.</p><h3 id="bullet-journaling">Bullet Journaling</h3><p>At first, I was skeptical of this system but the more I have used it, the more I have fallen in love with it.</p><p>The best approach for bullet journaling is using <em>good ‘ol pencil and paper</em>. Digital apps have the flaw of being in an environment that is full of distractions.</p><figure>

  </figure><p>All you need to get started is:</p><ul><li>A blank or dotted journal 📓</li><li>A pen 🖋</li><li>A passion to get things done. ✍️</li></ul><p>It all starts with an index page. This page will keep your journal organized. Then you create a Future Log, A monthly log, and a daily log. The reason why this system works so well for developers with ADHD is that it's easy to tweak. If you want to have a page for your doodles of Triforces, go for it. If you want to create an elaborate health and fitness tracker, you can do it.</p><p>If you need inspiration, there is no shortage of creative posts on Pintrest and Instagram.</p><p>For more info on Bullet Journaling, I recommend reading the <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p><p>I also recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkZEEQG6IVE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How To ADHD’s video</a> on bullet journaling.</p><h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2><p>Exercise has proven time and time again to be an excellent tool for just about everything.</p><p>On the mornings where I am not hitting the snooze button until the last moment, I try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise. I notice improvements in my mood and the ability to solve problems quicker.</p><p>It doesn’t need to be intense if you are starting your fitness journey, A walk around the park can do a lot for the mind. Proper exercise <a href="https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/adult-adhd-and-exercise#1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is shown</a> to reduce most symptoms of ADHD.</p><h2 id="time-management">Time Management</h2><h3 id="pomodoro-timers">Pomodoro Timers</h3><p>Pomodora timer is a system to make sure you stay focused on a task followed by a short break.</p><p>This is an easy way to ensure that you are giving your mind time to relax and not hyper-focus for too long. Every 25 minutes or so, you take a 5-minute break. Then after 3 “Pomodoras”, you take a 15-minute break. This system forces you to stick to a task with a promised reward of time you can do whatever you want without feeling guilty. That’s the beauty of this system. I’m using one right now while I write this.</p><figure>

Don’t be too hard on yourself when a system doesn’t work for you. Your brain is different. We are programmed to notice small details and think outside of the box. Change is hard and the worst thing you can do is think you are defective.</p><p>I live by this quote from BJ Fogg, the author of <a href="https://www.tinyhabits.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tiny Habits</a>.</p><blockquote><p>People change best by feeling good, not by feeling bad.</p></blockquote></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p><em>Part 1: How your user experience changes for the worse as the open web gives way to walled gardens</em></p><p>I hang out in two circles. Open web enthusiasts that are lamenting its demise, and regular users who are happy with their fast snappy apps and couldn't care less. </p><p>These groups have a hard time talking because the "open web" too often comes across as an idealistic abstract notion and most end users just don't tangibly feel the bad consequences. In fact, they're often happier with the snappy, vertically integrated experience of closed app ecosystems. </p><p>My goal here is to make it more palpable how everyday apps, searches and tools get worse when we let big centralized companies take over the web, and explore some paths for reversing it.</p><h2>What is the open web?</h2><p>Most definitions of the "open web" I've seen are either too technical to be accessible or too abstract to be usable and getting gridlocked in this debate often means watching from the sidelines while actual user welfare slowly diminishes.</p><p>Three characteristics that proponents of the open web will agree to in roughly descending order are:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease of publishing</strong>: anyone can publish to it freely or at least very cheaply, and is on the same footing with a globally accessible URL</li><li><strong>Ease of consuming</strong>: Net neutrality — ISP's dont cut deals with corporations to make some websites load faster or cheaper than others.</li><li><strong>Ease of remixing</strong>. You can see the source code. Content licenses and tools are permissive for derived works.</li></ul><h2>Detour: A framework to break down how people use the web</h2><p>I want to focus on the user experience point of view. To do this, I'm going to introduce a framework that divides up all our internet usage into two categories.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/xscGdbWOOPkGjdER.png" alt="Frame 1.png"></p><h3><strong>Unfamiliar problems</strong></h3><p>You have an unfamiliar problem and to solve it you either need to learn something new, or purchase goods or services to solve it</p><ul><li>e.g. taking out a mortgage, a health problem in the family, where to go to college, what skill to acquire next.</li><li>Unfamiliar problems are solved in large part with acquiring new knowledge, not just products or services.</li><li>These user journeys start with search engines — Google predominantly and **a lot of the time solving them is spent on web pages**.</li><li>When people are looking to solve unfamiliar problems, **revenue is typically higher-margin**, because users can't price the products and services as well.</li><li>These ultimately transition to being familiar problems.</li></ul><h3><strong>Familiar problems</strong></h3><ul><li>e.g. being entertained, keeping the dog food in stock,</li><li>These are best solved with apps like Email, Netflix, Twitter, DTC subscription boxes, etc.</li><li>Solving these needs has a very well defined user interaction journey. You open the app you're familiar with and follow its standard flow.</li><li>Revenue from people solving familiar problems is typically lower-margin and there's more competing products.
</li></ul><h3>How we're spending our time on familiar vs. unfamiliar problems</h3><p>Using time spent in apps vs mobile web on mobile is a way to proxy how we divide up our time.<strong> We spend most of our time on familiar problems but have a constant trickle of unfamiliar problems</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/cPuXkKFELALeIAkI.png" alt="Untitled (1).png"></p><h2>Unfamiliar problems are better solved with the open web</h2><p>Think about the last time you did some research, e.g. choosing a phone plan. You asked your friends, compared on forums, looked at the official sites, scribbled some notes and made a decision. Even if this journey was quick, you likely traversed a dozen services and products to do this.</p><p>Unfamiliar problems have less constraints, require creativity to solve, and thus are better suited to open solutions. Some other things that work for the open web here</p><ul><li>comparing alternatives is easier.</li><li>changing modalities (e.g. from reading to video) is easier.</li></ul><h2>Familiar problems stand to benefit more from tight vertical integration</h2><p>Take Spotify for example. It solves the very familiar problem of listening to music. Spotify just works better as an app because</p><ul><li>Controlling the user experience end to end makes for smoother flows.</li><li>Having all the user data kept with Spotify allows for better recommendation algorithms.</li><li>Spotify can easily hand off between devices.</li><li>It can run in the background</li></ul><p>Sure, the web can do a bunch of these things, but they're simply not first-class considerations in the open-read-close workflow that the browser was designed for.</p><h2>But the open web can be better for familiar problems too, especially for breaking monopolies</h2><p>Let's look at Amazon. Initially you start buying there because of their "always low prices" and the convenience of 2 day shipping. Over the years you keep shopping there, until you've forgotten that </p><ol><li>free 2 day shipping is now near universal</li><li>amazon isn't often the cheapest place</li></ol><p>On the Amazon app, you see the story around the product that best serves Amazon, not the buyer. Meanwhile, over on Insight you can use the web version and do all these things the app can't.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/ZEblynrLvBsutnlQ.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-17 at 5.42.21 PM.png"></p><p>... and not just that

</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/JVZoTRazmYPZXBQQ.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-17 at 5.59.22 PM.png"></p><h2><strong>How solving unfamiliar problems gets harder too</strong></h2><p>Unfamiliar problems are solved in large part with acquiring new knowledge, not just products or services. The incentives to freely create knowledge that solves unfamiliar problems is lost as the web closes down.</p><ul><li>Google increasingly takes a larger percent of ad revenue as they <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/">start extracting answers from pages and showing them on their search result pages.</a><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/"></a></li><li><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/"></a>Publishers have to either a) paywall their content (e.g. NYTimes) or b) subtly sell products (everyone standing a Wirecutter alternative), or c) ask for donations in order to survive.</li><li>Only a few big name publishers survive. Google and Facebook start sending them more of the traffic that's left, and since domain rank plays a big part in Google's ranking, those that survived assimilate more power and rank better.</li><li>and search engines seem more littered with SEO junk and less actually useful information year over year.</li></ul><h2>In conclusion, and where we fit in.</h2><p>And that's how your user experience slowly degrades, and that's why we stand to suffer as users if we give up the ability to remix software that the web brought us and closed apps are now taking away. </p><p>Our goal with Insight is to give the web (in particular on mobile) a fighting chance by exhibiting how it can be more powerful than a closed ecosystem and give more control to the end-user. We do this by showcasing the web's infinite extensibility and customizability for common use cases like <a href="http://insightbrowser.com/collections/search">search</a>, <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/shopping">shopping</a>, <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/reading">reading</a> and <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/cooking">cooking</a>.</p><p>Insight's advanced features will soon only be available to Pro subscription users but for a limited time we're opening up <strong>lifetime free beta access if you download it via TestFlight below.</strong></p><h3>Coming up in part 2</h3><ul><li>What parts of the open web probably should die off?</li><li>A pragmatic path for what's left of the open web to thrive again.</li></ul><p>We'd love to hear from you, feel free to tweet at or DM us at @<a href="https://twitter.com/insightbrowser">insightbrowser</a>, and my personal Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/abhinavsharma">@abhinavsharma</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A couple of years ago, at another job, I hired this guy for a data entry position. He seemed like a decently smart guy who could type fairly quickly, even if maybe he was a bit of a bro. He was at the company for well over a year, I'm pretty sure, but my memory is pretty shoddy. He'd earned "Employee of the Month" twice in one year, which was something we debated about and wasn't just a random pick!</p>
<p>Then one morning, he didn't show up to work. No call, no email, nothing. The next day, he still wasn't there. I'm pretty sure it was this day, or the next, I called his emergency contact: his girlfriend; just to make sure he was okay! I wasn't trying to be a nosey up-your-ass manager or anything, it was unusual for him to just no show... plus we needed to know if we needed to hire someone else...</p>
<p>His girlfriend answered the phone. I told her who I was, her boyfriend's manager, and that we hadn't heard from him in two or three days and we're just checking in to make sure he's okay? She said, "Uhh, hold on a second," and hung up the phone. When I called her back (maybe we'd gotten disconnected?) it went to voicemail.</p>
<p>At this point it seemed pretty clear that he wasn't going to come back to work, so we set about looking for his replacement. Pretty lame that he did that, but who knows why people do the things they do? A week or two later, the company got the paperwork from the unemployment office for him. He's trying to get money from the EDD!</p>
<p>The company explains to EDD: No, he no-called, no-showed, he probably shouldn't get unemployment. And then the guy tells EDD: I was actually secretly fired by my manager on the morning of <em>insert date here</em>. But <em>I</em> was his manager! And I didn't do that. I don't know if he elected for it or if it just automatically happened, but a hearing in front of a judge was scheduled for a week later. Normally the company wouldn't have gone to such great lengths to deny someone unemployment, but he just flaked out. Very uncool.</p>
<p>The first absurd thing about the story is that he was a <em>good</em> employee. I had been a manager long enough to know that it's a pain in the ass to hire people, and it sucks when they're not good employees because it's such a waste of time and energy. The last thing I'd want to do is willingly get rid of a good employee. And we had proof he was a good employee: emails I'd sent to others about him; emails I'd sent <em>to</em> him directly, praising him; and the aforementioned two time Employee of the Month receipts.</p>
<p>I also had a bit of an ace up my sleeve: we had security cameras everywhere. He knew this, because he used them sometimes as part of his training. So, trying to be well prepared for the 'hearing' or whatever it would be, I sat down and I exhaustively recorded my whereabouts on the day in question. I noted down every time I left my desk, where I went, how long I was gone, and who was in the rooms with me where I was. I was almost never alone, and always on camera. I'm pretty sure I also prepared a statement, in addition to the email 'evidence packet', just to be thorough.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the truth about this guy is that while he was a good employee, he wasn't a happy one. He had bigger aspirations. When getting to know him, I'd asked him what he most wanted to do, for work, with his life, or whatever. He said he wanted to be an entrepreneur. An entrepreneur of what? I asked. He didn't have an answer, it didn't matter, he just wanted to be <em>an entrepreneur</em>.</p>
<p>He wasn't happy that he was a 'lowly' data entry person. We'd tried to get him involved in the inventory security program we had, but looking at camera footage bored him. He asked at one point if the company would pay him while he learned how to grow marijuana, so he could become a sales person and make more money. The company said no, we won't pay you to learn to grow, but we'll give you access to our training program documents so you can learn on your own. Disappointed, he declined the offer. Unfortunately for him, there just weren't any open positions in the company he'd be a good fit for, so he was stuck doing data entry.</p>
<p>This is mostly just making fun of him, but I'll allow it: one day a nearby company put out a pallet of 3M foam earplugs, boxes within boxes, a couple hundred earplugs a piece. We all took a couple boxes. He came to work the next day saying he was going to sell the earplugs online, with photos of Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump glued to them, as a novelty gift, with statements like, "the holidays might get loud this year!" or something. This idea never actually got off the ground.</p>
<p>The day of the hearing, I arrived with the HR assistant and we sat at a long table. My former data-entry clerk was sitting directly across the table from us. Some judge sat down at the end of the table taking notes. I honestly don't remember who spoke first, but the story was pretty simple: He alleged that, sometime on the morning in question, I walked upstairs to where he was working, walked him down through the building, through the back offices, out to the back of building by the street, and told him we'd no longer be needing his services, and he immediately walked down to the bus stop and left.</p>
<p>So I asked him, what time did this happen? And I don't remember what time he said, but it didn't matter, I responded: Well, I have this chart here I made of where I was, and who I was with, for every moment of the day, and at no point was he anywhere to be seen. I submitted that shit into evidence, which wasn't as dramatic as it sounds when you say it that way, all I did was hand it to the judge. The judge asked him if he had any objection to it, and he said of course, and explained that I was in charge of security cameras--true--so I could fake the whole thing or just make up a list. The judge didn't find that very convincing.</p>
<p>I also shared the fact that we knew he wasn't happy, but that otherwise he was a good employee as evidenced by the internal emails, emails to him, and the Employee of the Month awards. He said that we gave out Employee of the Month awards just to quiet down unhappy employees, which is only true sometimes, and may have been why he received it twice in one year without us noticing...</p>
<p>I also asked him some of the more obvious questions: who else witnessed me walk through the building with you? Why didn't you go back upstairs to grab your huge bag of pistachios and other snacks, or to say bye to any of your co-workers? And when I called two days later, and your girlfriend answered, why didn't you talk to me or call me back?</p>
<p>The judge really jumped on that last one, saying: yeah, if this guy fired you, and then called your girlfriend 'pretending' you no-showed, wouldn't you wanna cuss him out or something? Give him a piece of your mind? He didn't have great answers to any of these questions, beyond that he was upset and confused about what happened, so he didn't want to talk to me or anyone.</p>
<p>At the end of the hearing the judge said, I'm pretty sure this is verbatim, "This is a peculiar situation. Two people who have entirely, completely different stories. But you both seem credible. He seems credible, and he seems credible. Very interesting."</p>
<p>Obviously, we received word the judge ruled in our favor a short time later, and rejected his claim for unemployment. He then appealed, this time with a new story. If I remember correctly, he suggested that one of his former managers (before me) didn't like him, and that they were using me to fire him because of it. None of that came up in the hearing, though, and after review of the case by another judge his appeal was rejected.</p>
<p>I don't manage people anymore, and I'm kind of very glad that I don't. I might have had a worse than average experience, because the company wanted to pay people the bare minimum amount needed to hire someone, <em>anyone</em>, and I ended up with employees who were often lazy, dishonest, and manipulative. You'd think being dishonest would take so much effort it'd be better to just do the job you're meant to do, but no.</p>
<p>Prior to this guy, I was used to employees telling bald-faced lies directly to my face, usually ones I couldn't quite prove. But this was the first time that those lies directly involved me, saying I went and did things that I definitely didn't. Luckily, I was sitting in front of an impartial judge, and at absolutely no personal risk whatsoever, so if I failed to prove that fact it wasn't that big of a deal.</p>
<p>But, in different circumstances (like if I worked for a larger company), he could have written a Medium post, or talked to a reporter, and voiced his fabricated mistreatment to the world at large. I could just imagine how the article would account, in detail, his alleged mistreatment ("they wouldn't pay me to learn...") and the day I led him outside and fired him, maliciously, leaving him destitute and dependent on his girlfriend.</p>
<p>And then there'd be a single sentence at the end of the article: "The company denies these allegations." That'd be all the defense I'd get, that the company would be legally allowed to give itself. I mean, I probably wouldn't be named, but I and anyone else working there would know he was talking about me, which could hurt me. Luckily, I'm awesome, and that wouldn't hurt my feelings too much. But there's other people out there, less awesome, and more susceptible to hurt feelings.</p>
<p>The point is: when it comes down to it, sometimes people can be dishonest about work. That can be work they did in the past for other people, or work they're doing right now, for you. People who seem to have a relatively normal level of dysfunctional habits can suddenly, one day, just do something completely unexpected when there's money on the line. It's important to be aware of this, and not just blindly trust everyone who cries mistreatment at the hands of a company. <em>Sometimes</em>, not always, they're just a grifter, looking for sympathy and a handout.</p></div></div></div>]]>

                <div>
                    <p>Yesterday, my cofounder wrote a <a href="https://blog.nillium.com/its-time-to-remove-news-from-facebook-and-google/">controversial post on this blog</a>, presenting a case for news publishers to limit -- or remove -- their reporting from Facebook and Google. &nbsp;The responses were immediate and plentiful, but fascinatingly different depending on the audience.</p><p>On Hacker News, a tech- and startup-focused forum, the link rose to the top of the list before being “flagged” and removed from the front page. &nbsp;The<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25249414"> comments there</a> took a more pragmatic, technical approach to the problem, from “<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25249553">The technical capability already exists in the form of robots.txt and the referer header,</a>” to constant reminders that news organizations <em>need</em> this traffic.</p><p>On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/">r/journalism subreddit</a>, we were hit from the other side. &nbsp;Why not just “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/ge3zqq2/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">nationalize the press so we can quit with the hand-wringing</a>?” suggested one commenter, while another lamented that “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/ge51kko/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">this idea disenfranchises young journalists who don’t have any name credibility and recognition and need an established platforms [sic] gravitas to help establish them</a>.”</p><p>If ever there was a good illustration of the disconnect we face in trying to make journalism sustainable again, this is it. &nbsp;The tech side that constantly proclaims “information wants to be free,” and sees pay-for-journalism as a solved problem through Substack, and the jaded newsroom audience who sees another tech platform trying to come in and get them financially hooked.</p><p>The problem, of course, is that it is not a problem equally felt across these camps. &nbsp;The Hacker News crowd is absolutely correct when they say that news organizations need the traffic coming from social media and aggregators -- they do! -- but that is a sign of addiction, not a healthy ecosystem. &nbsp;And the journalist demographic has every reason to assume the worst, because they have been hurt before.</p><p>The economics of this are simple. &nbsp;</p><p>A few decades ago, people subscribed to newspapers, written on paper, that were delivered every morning. &nbsp;The subscription fee never fully covered the cost of running a newspaper; ads appeared between articles, and that subscription base guaranteed an audience for the sponsors. &nbsp;These publications naively started putting their articles online for free -- if advertising could buoy their business up until this point, why would the web be any different? &nbsp;As the ad market matured, CPMs increased, and slowly, internet advertising started to represent real money.</p><p>But then things went viral. &nbsp;Lots of things. &nbsp;People started sharing news articles they read (or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/06/16/six-in-10-of-you-will-share-this-link-without-reading-it-according-to-a-new-and-depressing-study/%20Show%20less">didn’t read</a>) on social media. &nbsp;Tech companies tweaked their sorting algorithms to get content to eyeballs -- and did so incredibly successfully. But, this created our first problem.</p><h3 id="problem-1-hard-news-doesn-t-trend">Problem 1: Hard news doesn't trend</h3><p>Admittedly, this is only a problem depending on what side of the fence you sit.</p><p>If your goal -- like that of any number of tech companies -- is to get content in front of your users that they will engage with -- then this has been an unmitigated success. &nbsp;However, if you are reporting out a story for a specific audience, not being able to reach them is problematic. &nbsp;</p><p>At this point, the tech side may wonder why if your articles are so great, the audience isn’t seeking it out. &nbsp;The answer, I suspect, is that the audience does not know it is there.</p><p>Virtually any digital editor will tell you that most traffic bypasses the homepage. &nbsp;Users rarely think &nbsp;“I wonder what is happening today?” and seek out the news site; rather, they are told what is happening by the sorting algorithms and walk away feeling like they are updated. &nbsp;That works to a degree, except that hard news -- especially local news -- does not trend.</p><p>No one shares the summary of last night’s city council meeting. &nbsp;Even the most damning investigative report will only get so far if it is focused on a small area; users outside the area just won’t amplify it.</p><h3 id="problem-2-fake-news">Problem 2: Fake News</h3><p>What <em>does</em> trend? &nbsp;The outrageous, crazy things that you want to share with the world. &nbsp;Of course, that’s not to say all viral headlines are fake, but at this point it seems pretty well accepted that many are.</p><p>Because anyone can write and post anything, these wholly fabricated, or hyper-partisan stories are usually placed in the same regard as those that are rigorously reported and fact-checked. They are then forced to compete against each other for attention.</p><p>Worse yet, these posts can be so malignant that it impugns the reputation of “the media” -- because now you cannot believe what you read.<br></p><h3 id="problem-3-clickbait">Problem 3: Clickbait</h3><p>How do you compete then? &nbsp;By stooping lower. &nbsp;It means publishers resort to writing clickbait headlines to grab a second or two of user attention, and then covering the article page in more clickbait links to keep them there. &nbsp;</p><p>It can even creep into the editorial decisions: Knowing what people are searching for or clicking on can shape what reporters are assigned. <br></p><h3 id="problem-4-all-the-ads">Problem 4: All the ads</h3><p>Why do drivers in your area need to know about that new law? &nbsp;What celebrity finally “broke [their] silence?” &nbsp;I <em>know</em> I won’t believe what happens next. &nbsp;</p><p>These ads are annoying. These ads are detrimental to the user experience that any publication wants. &nbsp;But these ads are needed -- they are a symptom of the addiction. &nbsp;When the flow of users becomes constricted, these organizations have no other choice but to exploit their traffic for as much as it is worth; it’s survival.</p><p>Those ads in between articles in the print newspaper? &nbsp;They still exist, but they are now sold by Facebook, Twitter, and Google. &nbsp;Money is still being made off of the reader, it just is not going to the people doing the reporting. &nbsp;And partnerships between newsrooms and tech giants are generally for big, national outlets, leaving the local newsroom to suffer.</p><h3 id="problem-5-brain-drain">Problem 5: Brain drain</h3><p>As awful as this all is for the casual news consumer, it is worse for the people working on it all day everyday. &nbsp;No one wants assignment-by-SEO. No one wants the ads all over the place. And most of all, no one wants the layoffs. &nbsp;So those that can are fleeing to Substack, or creating their own publications.</p><p>That is great for them, and I wish them all the best. &nbsp;But as that Reddit commenter pointed out, that only works for reporters who have made a name for themselves. &nbsp;It is much more common to follow someone because you like their ideas than someone who you think reports out a story well. &nbsp;</p><p>What about all of those wide eyed, young, idealistic reporters <em>looking </em>to make a name for themselves? &nbsp;What about all of the important stories <em>they</em> are covering? &nbsp;Will now fewer people go to the legacy publications once the big names jump ship?<br></p><h3 id="what-we-re-doing">What we're doing</h3><p>This is why Xana wrote what she did, and made the case firms should pay up. &nbsp;First, it got your attention enough to rise above the noise (a requirement, as discussed above). And it also presented this point: The traffic coming from big tech, while needed for local news’ survival, is also killing it. The answer cannot be found in robots.txt -- it comes from rethinking the model of how we find our users, and how we interact with them.</p><p>Forth is our answer. &nbsp; </p><p>We want to take what is appealing about discovering news on social, and replicate it, but with reporters we know and trust. &nbsp;We want to help them build personal brands because we know younger generations tend to trust real people over companies or institutions (think: influencers). &nbsp;We want to rev-share, not because we think it is a selling point, but to align our incentives with those of the newsrooms; we both succeed together.</p><p>We will be launching soon in markets where we feel we have enough reporters to make using our app worthwhile. &nbsp;If you are a reporter or represent a newsroom, we would love to hear from you at <a href="mailto:hello@nillium.com">hello@nillium.com</a>. &nbsp;If you want to read what our partners are writing, please sign up for the <a href="https://www.forthapp.com/list.html">waiting list</a> -- we will let you know as soon as we are live in your area.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The regex literals optimization avoids running the regex engine on parts of the input text that cannot possibly ever match the regex.</p>

<p>An example of a regex this can be applied to is <code>\w+@\w+\.\w+</code>, where the algorithm <em>quickly</em> finds the first <code>@</code>, then matches <code>\w+</code> backwards to find the start of the match, and then matches <code>\w+\.\w+</code> forward to find the end of the match. It then finds the second <code>@</code>, starting from the end of the previous match, and so on. This is a fairly naive (and incorrect) implementation, but it gives the idea of how it works.</p>

<p>I’ve recently implemented it in my pet project <a href="https://github.com/nitely/nim-regex/pull/68">nim-regex</a>, an NFA based regex engine that runs in (super)linear time. The results show it’s around ~100x faster than before in some benchmarks. It’s up to ~60x faster than PCRE when the optimization kicks in. The tests are based on <a href="https://github.com/mariomka/regex-benchmark">mariomka/regex-benchmark</a>.</p>

<p>This is not to be confused with <em>Chivers’ String Prefix Optimization</em>.</p>

<h2 id="literals-optimization">Literals Optimization</h2>

<p>Since nim-regex has to guarantee linear time, I’ll describe optimizations that are guaranteed to take linear time. We must also ensure the matches are not overlapped.</p>

<p>I think the best way to understand how this optimization works is by example. However, here’s a high-level description of the algorithm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We pick a literal that is <code>memchr</code>‘ed to skip parts of the text.</li>
  <li>The prefix is the regex part before the literal; none of the
characters or symbols within the prefix must match the literal.</li>
  <li>The prefix is ran backwards to find the start of the match.</li>
  <li>A full scan is ran from the start of the match
until a character that cannot be matched is found (safe break point)
or the end is reached. The scan tries to start the match at every character (NFAs can do this in linear time).</li>
  <li>Go to step one and repeat from the last scanned char. Make the prefix
match until the previous last scanned char.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two important constraints to picking a literal:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>“none of the characters or symbols within the prefix must match the literal”</em>, why? consider the regex: <code>\d\w+x</code>, and the input text: <code>xxxxxxxxxxx</code>; this would take quadratic time, as the prefix will match until the start of the string every time. What about the limit? while the limit does avoid the excessive matching, sometimes we’d need to match past the limit, ex: regex: <code>\d\w+x</code>, and text: <code>1xxx</code>. If we add this constraint, the literal becomes a delimeter, and these cases are solved.</li>
  <li>The literal cannot be part of a repetition, nor it can be part of an alternation. For example: <code>(abc)*def</code> the first literal candidate is <code>d</code>, since <code>(abc)*</code> may or may not be part of the match. Same thing for alternations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s the main algorithm in <a href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nim"><span>func</span> <span>findAll</span><span>(</span>
  <span>matches</span><span>:</span> <span>var</span> <span>Matches</span><span>,</span>

    <span>limit</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span>  <span># rather pointless since the literal is a delimiter</span>

<p>A given character may be consumed only twice, once by the backward prefix match, and a second time by the forward scan. Hence the algorithm runs in linear time.</p>

<p>I may describe how <code>matchPrefix</code> and <code>findSome</code> work, how to construct the reversed NFA in the right order, and how to pick the literal in a future article. The nim-regex code contains descriptions of the algorithms, though.</p>

<h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/nitely/nim-regex/tree/master/bench">benchmarks</a> regexes are based on <a href="https://github.com/mariomka/regex-benchmark">mariomka/regex-benchmark</a>. The only difference is the regexes are pre-compiled, so just the matching is tested. The results show nim-regex is ~63x faster than PCRE in the email test, and ~2x faster in the URI and IP tests.</p>

<p>Why is nim-regex so fast in the email case? The regex engine doesn’t run as often. There are orders of magnitud more IP/URI candidates than email candidates (<code>@</code> chars within the text) to match. In the former case the time is dominated by the regex engine, while in the latter case it’s dominated by searching the char literal.</p>

  <p>Note Nim’s PCRE is at the top of the mariomka/regex-benchmark. I ran those benchmarks, and IIRC nim-regex was just a bit faster, mainly because the non-macro regex engine is slower (see the above results), and the regex compilation is also tested.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="other-optimizations">Other optimizations</h2>

<p>Here are other possible optimizations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Picking a literal —even if the prefix matches it— should take linear time as long as the prefix is bounded (i.e: does not contain repetitions), ex: <code>\d\wx</code>.</li>
  <li>Picking a literal within a “one or more” repetition/repetition group should be possible, since <code>(abc)+</code> matches the same as <code>abc(abc)*</code>.</li>
  <li>It’s better to pick the last literal within the first literal sequence, since that way we always try to match as many literals as possible early on, and potentially fail early. We want to keep the prefix regex as short as possible, so the picking a literal in the first sequence is best.</li>
  <li>Alternations can be optimized this very same way in some cases, ex: <code>bar|baz</code>, since both alternations have <code>ba</code> in common, <code>a</code> can be picked as the literal.</li>
  <li>Alternations can be optimized in other cases. PCRE seems to use <code>memchr</code> or similar for up to two alternation terms. A DFA could be used to quickly match candidates instead of <code>memchr</code>, as that’s a more general solution.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Literals optimization is not a general optimization as it does not work on every regex, but when it does, it can greatly improve the matching speed.</p>

<p>Can a backtracker like PCRE implement this? PCRE in particular already has some sort of similar optimization, but it’s not as good/fast as this one. Backtrackers usually guarantee constant space, so they cannot implement this as described here exactly, but they can do something similar that requires backtracking. If they either provide a resumable <code>find</code> function, or relax this constraint, then probably yes.</p>

<p>Hopefully, more regex engines will implement these sort of optimizations, so they are more compelling alternatives to backtrackers such as PCRE.</p>

<h2><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></h2>



<p>In the publication entitled “Detection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real-time RT-PCR” (Eurosurveillance 25(8) 2020) the authors present a diagnostic workflow and RT-qPCR protocol for detection and diagnostics of 2019-nCoV (now known as SARS-CoV-2), which they claim to be validated, as well as being a robust diagnostic methodology for use in public-health laboratory settings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In light of all the consequences resulting from this very publication for societies worldwide, a group of independent researchers performed a point-by-point review of the aforesaid publication in which 1) all components of the presented test design were cross checked, 2) the RT-qPCR protocol-recommendations were assessed w.r.t. good laboratory practice, and 3) parameters examined against relevant scientific literature covering the field.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>The published RT-qPCR protocol for detection and diagnostics of 2019-nCoV and the manuscript suffer from numerous technical and scientific errors, including insufficient primer design, a problematic and insufficient RT-qPCR protocol, and the absence of an accurate test validation. Neither the presented test nor the manuscript itself fulfils the requirements for an acceptable scientific publication. Further, serious conflicts of interest of the authors are not mentioned. Finally, the very short timescale between submission and acceptance of the publication (24 hours) signifies that a systematic peer review process was either not performed here, or of problematic poor quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;We provide compelling evidence of several scientific inadequacies, errors and flaws. </p><p>Considering the scientific and methodological blemishes presented here, we are confident that the editorial board of Eurosurveillance has no other choice but to retract the publication.</p></div>







<h2><strong>CONCISE REVIEW REPORT</strong></h2>



<div><p>This paper will show numerous serious flaws in the Corman-Drosten paper, the significance of which has led to worldwide misdiagnosis of infections attributed to SARS-CoV-2 and associated with the disease COVID-19. We are confronted with stringent lockdowns which have destroyed many people’s lives and livelihoods, limited access to education and these imposed restrictions by governments around the world are a direct attack on people’s basic rights and their personal freedoms, resulting in collateral damage for entire economies on a global scale.</p><p><strong>There are ten fatal problems with the Corman-Drosten paper which we will outline and explain in greater detail in the following sections.</strong></p></div>



<p>The first and major issue is that the novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (in the publication named 2019-nCoV and in February 2020 named SARS-CoV-2 by an international consortium of virus experts) is based on in silico (theoretical) sequences, supplied by a laboratory in China [1], because at the time neither control material of infectious (“live”) or inactivated SARS-CoV-2 nor isolated genomic RNA of the virus was available to the authors. To date no validation has been performed by the authorship based on isolated SARS-CoV-2 viruses or full length RNA thereof. According to Corman et al.:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong><em>“We aimed to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodology for use in public health laboratory settings without having virus material available.”</em> [1]</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>The focus here should be placed upon the two stated aims: a) <em>development</em> and b) <em>deployment of a diagnostic test for use in public health laboratory settings</em>. These aims are not achievable without having any actual virus material available (e.g. for determining the infectious viral load). In any case, only a protocol with maximal accuracy can be the mandatory and primary goal in any scenario-outcome of this magnitude. Critical viral load determination is mandatory information, and it is in Christian Drosten’s group responsibility to perform these experiments and provide the crucial data.</p>



<div><p>Nevertheless these in silico sequences were used to develop a RT-PCR test methodology to identify the aforesaid virus. This model was based on the assumption that the novel virus is very similar to SARS-CoV from 2003 as both are beta-coronaviruses.</p><p>The PCR test was therefore designed using the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV as a control material for the Sarbeco component; we know this from our personal email-communication with [2] one of the co-authors of the Corman-Drosten paper. This method to model SARS-CoV-2 was described in the Corman-Drosten paper as follows:</p></div>



<blockquote><p><em>“<strong>the establishment and validation of a diagnostic workflow for 2019-nCoV</strong> <strong>screening and specific confirmation, designed in absence of available virus isolates or original patient specimens. Design and validation were enabled by the close genetic relatedness to the 2003 SARS-CoV, and aided by the use of synthetic nucleic acid technology.”</strong></em></p></blockquote>



<p>The Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is an important biomolecular technology to rapidly detect rare RNA fragments, which are known in advance. In the first step, RNA molecules present in the sample are reverse transcribed to yield cDNA. The cDNA is then amplified in the polymerase chain reaction using a specific primer pair and a thermostable DNA polymerase enzyme. The technology is highly sensitive and its detection limit is theoretically 1 molecule of cDNA. The specificity of the PCR is highly influenced by biomolecular design errors.</p>



<h3><strong>What is important when designing an RT-PCR Test and the quantitative RT-qPCR test described in the Corman-Drosten publication?</strong></h3>



<h5><strong>1. The primers and probes:</strong></h5>



<p>a) the concentration of primers and probes must be of optimal range <br>(100-200 nM)<br>b) must be specific to the target-gene you want to amplify<br>c) must have an optimal percentage of GC content relative to the total nitrogenous bases (minimum 40%, maximum 60%)<br>d) for virus diagnostics at least 3 primer pairs must detect 3 viral genes (preferably as far apart as possible in the viral genome)</p>



<h5><strong>2. The temperature at which all reactions take place:</strong></h5>



<p>a) DNA melting temperature (&gt;92°)<br>b) DNA amplification temperature (TaqPol specific)<br>c) Tm; the annealing temperature (the temperature at which the primers and probes reach the target binding/detachment, not to exceed 2 ̊C per primer pair). Tm heavily depends on GC content of the primers</p>



<h5><strong>3. The number of amplification cycles (less than 35; preferably 25-30 cycles);</strong></h5>



<p>In case of virus detection, &gt;35 cycles only detects signals which do not correlate with infectious virus as determined by isolation in cell culture [reviewed in 2]; if someone is tested by PCR as positive when a threshold of 35 cycles or higher is used (as is the case in most laboratories in Europe &amp; the US), the probability that said person is actually infected is less than 3%, the probability that said result is a false positive is 97% [reviewed in 3]</p>



<h5><strong>4. Molecular biological validations; amplified PCR products must be validated either by running the products in a gel with a DNA ruler, or by direct DNA sequencing</strong></h5>



<h5><strong>5. Positive and negative controls should be specified to confirm/refute specific virus detection</strong></h5>



<h5><strong>6. There should be a Standard Operational Procedure (SOP) available</strong></h5>



<p>SOP unequivocally specifies the above parameters, so that all laboratories are able to set up the exact same test conditions. To have a validated universal SOP is essential, because it enables the comparison of data within and between countries.</p>



<h3><strong>MINOR CONCERNS WITH THE CORMAN-DROSTEN PAPER</strong></h3>



<p>1. In Table 1 of the Corman-Drosten paper, different abbreviations are stated – “nM” is specified, “nm” isn’t. Further in regards to correct nomenclature, nm means “nanometer” therefore nm should read nM here.</p>



<p>2. It is the general consensus to write genetic sequences always in the 5’-3’ direction, including the reverse primers. It is highly unusual to do alignment with reverse complementary writing of the primer sequence as the authors did in figure 2 of the Corman-Drosten paper. Here, in addition, a wobble base is marked as “y” without description of the bases the Y stands for.</p>



<p>3. Two misleading pitfalls in the Corman-Drosten paper are that their Table 1 does not include Tm-values (annealing-temperature values), neither does it show GC-values (number of G and C in the sequences as %-value of total bases).</p>



<h3><strong>MAJOR CONCERNS WITH THE CORMAN-DROSTEN PAPER</strong></h3>



<h4>A) BACKGROUND</h4>



<div><p>The authors introduce the background for their scientific work as: “The ongoing outbreak of the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) poses a challenge for public health laboratories as virus isolates are unavailable while there is growing evidence that the outbreak is more widespread than initially thought, and international spread through travelers does already occur”.</p><p>According to BBC News [4] and Google Statistics [5] there were 6 deaths world-wide on January 21st 2020 – the day when the manuscript was submitted. Why did the authors assume a challenge for public health laboratories while there was no substantial …</p></div></article></div>

                Most people find the film (even in its surviving truncated versions) 
                rather brilliant, but Wells didn't like it much, perhaps because 
                he believes it was 'plagiarized' from his "When The Sleeper 
                Wakes."</p></span></i></p>
<p>I have recently seen the silliest film.  </p>
<p>I do not believe it
would be possible to make one sillier.  </p>
<p>And as this film sets out to display the
way the world is going,  </p>
<p>I think [my book] The Way the World is Going may very
well concern itself with this film.  </p>
<p>It is called Metropolis, it comes from the
great Ufa studios in Germany, and the public is given to understand that it has
been produced at enormous cost.  </p>
<p>It gives in one eddying concentration almost
every possible foolishness, cliché, platitude, and muddlement about mechanical
progress and progress in general served up with a sauce of sentimentality that
is all its own.</p>
<p><img src="https://erkelzaar.tsudao.com/reviews/metro163.jpg" width="485" height="745"></p>
<p>It is a
German film and there have been some amazingly good German films, before they
began to cultivate bad work under cover of a protective quota. And this film has
been adapted to the Anglo-Saxon taste, and quite possibly it has suffered in the
process, but even when every allowance has been made for that, there remains
enough to convince the intelligent observer that most of its silliness must be
fundamental.  </p>
<p>Possibly I dislike this soupy whirlpool none the less because I
find decaying fragments of my own juvenile work of thirty years ago, The Sleeper
Awakes, floating about in it. </p>
<p>Capek's Robots have been lifted without apology,
and that soulless mechanical monster of Mary Shelley's, who has fathered so many
German inventions, breeds once more in this confusion.  </p>
<p>Originality there is
none. Independent thought, none.  </p>
<p>Where nobody has imagined for them the authors
have simply fallen back on contemporary things.  </p>
<p>The aeroplanes that wander about above the great city show no 
advance on contemporary types, though all that stuff could have been livened up 
immensely with a few helicopters and vertical or unexpected movements. </p>
<p>The motor cars are 1926 models or earlier. I do not think there 
is a single new idea, a single instance of artistic creation or even intelligent 
anticipation, from first to last in the whole pretentious stew; I may have 
missed some point of novelty, but I doubt it; and this, though it must bore the 
intelligent man in the audience, makes the film all the more convenient as a 
gauge of the circle of ideas, the mentality, from which it has proceeded.</p>
<p>The word Metropolis, says the advertisement in English, 'is
in itself symbolic of greatness'- which only shows us how wise it is to consult
a dictionary before making assertions about the meaning of words.  </p>
<p>Probably it
was the adapter who made that shot. The German 'Neubabelsburg' was better, and
could have been rendered 'New Babel'. It is a city, we are told, of 'about one
hundred years hence.' It is represented as being enormously high; and all the
air and happiness are above and the workers live, as the servile toilers in the
blue uniform in The Sleeper Awakes lived, down, down, down below.</p>
<p>Now far away in the dear old 1897 it may have been excusable
to symbolize social relations in this way, but that was thirty years ago, and a
lot of thinking and some experience intervene.  </p>
<p>That vertical city of the future
we know now is, to put it mildly, highly improbable. Even in New York and
Chicago, where the pressure on the central sites is exceptionally great, it is
only the central office and entertainment region that soars and excavates. And
the same centripetal pressure that leads to the utmost exploitation of site
values at the centre leads also to the driving out of industrialism and labour
from the population center to cheaper areas, and of residential life to more
open and airy surroundings. That was all discussed and written about before
1900. Somewhere about 1930 the geniuses of Ufa studios will come up to a book of
Anticipations which was written more than a quarter of a century ago. The
British census returns of 1901 proved clearly that city populations were
becoming centrifugal, and that every increase in horizontal traffic facilities
produced a further distribution. This vertical social stratification is stale
old stuff. So far from being 'a hundred years hence,' Metropolis, in its forms
and shapes, is already, as a possibility, a third of a century out of date.</p>
<p>But its form is the least part of its staleness. This great
city is supposed to be evoked by a single dominating personality. The English
version calls him John Masterman, so that there may be no mistake about his
quality. Very unwisely he has called his son Eric, instead of sticking to good
hard John, and so relaxed the strain. He works with an inventor, one Rotwang,
and they make machines. There are a certain number of other people, and the
'sons of the rich' are seen disporting themselves, with underclad ladies in a
sort of joy conservatory, rather like the 'winter garden' of an enterprising
1890 hotel during an orgy. The rest of the population is in a state of abject
slavery, working in 'shifts' of ten hours in some mysteriously divided
twenty-four hours, and with no money to spend or property or freedom. The
machines make wealth. How, is not stated. We are shown rows of motor cars all
exactly alike; but the workers cannot own these, and no 'sons of the rich'
would. Even the middle classes nowadays want a car with personality. Probably
Masterman makes these cars in endless series to amuse himself.</p>
              <p><span face="Times New Roman"><img src="https://erkelzaar.tsudao.com/reviews/metro50.jpg" width="254" height="430"></span>One 
                is asked to believe that these machines are engaged quite furiously 
                in the mass production of nothing that is ever used, and that 
                Masterman grows richer and richer in the process. This is the 
                essential nonsense of it all. Unless the mass of the population 
                has the spending power there is no possibility of wealth in a 
                mechanical civilization. A vast, penniless slave population may 
                be necessary for wealth where there are no mass production machines, 
                but it is preposterous with mass production machines. You find 
                such a real proletariat in China still; it existed in the great 
                cities of the ancient world; but you do not find it in America, 
                which has gone furtherest in the direction of mechanical industry, 
                and there is no grain of reason in supposing it will exist in 
                the future. Masterman's watchword is 'Efficiency,' and you are 
                given to understand it is a very dreadful word, and the contrivers 
                of this idiotic spectacle are so hopelessly ignorant of all the 
                work that has been done upon industrial efficiency that they represent 
                him as working his machine-minders to the point of exhaustion, 
                so that they faint and machines explode and people are scalded 
                to death. You get machine-minders in torment turning levers in 
                response to signals - work that could be done far more effectively 
                by automata. Much stress is laid on the fact that the workers 
                are spiritless, hopeless drudges, working reluctantly and mechanically. 
                But a mechanical civilization has no use for mere drudges; the 
                more efficient its machinery the less need there is for the quasi-mechanical 
                minder. It is the inefficient factory that needs slaves; the ill-organized 
                mine that kills men. The hopeless drudge stage of human labour 
                lies behind us. With a sort of malignant stupidity this film contradicts 
                these facts.</p>
<p>The current tendency of economic life is to oust the mere
drudge altogether, to replace much highly skilled manual work by exquisite
machinery in skilled hands, and to increase the relative proportion of
semi-skilled, moderately versatile and fairly comfortable workers. It may indeed
create temporary masses of unemployed, and in The Sleeper Awakes there was a
mass of unemployed people under the hatches. That was written in 1897, when the
possibility of restraining the growth of large masses of population had scarcely
dawned on the world. It was reasonable then to anticipate an embarrassing
underworld of under-productive people. We did not know what to do with the
abyss. But there is no excuse for that today. And what this film anticipates is
not unemployment, but drudge employment, which is precisely what is passing
away. Its fabricators have not even realized that the machine ousts the drudge.</p>
<p>'Efficiency' means large-scale productions, machinery as
fully developed as possible, and <i>high</i> <i>wages</i>. The British
Government delegation sent to study success in America has reported unanimously
to that effect. The increasingly efficient industrialism of America has so
little need of drudges that it has set up the severest barriers against the
flooding of the United States by drudge immigration. 'Ufa' knows nothing of such
facts.</p>
<p>A young woman appears from nowhere in particular to 'help'
these drudges; she impinges upon Masterman's son Eric, and they go to the
'Catacombs,' which, in spite of the gas mains, steam mains, cables, and
drainage, have somehow contrived to get over from Rome, skeletons and all, and
burrow under this city of Metropolis. She conducts a sort of Christian worship
in these unaccountable caverns, and the drudges love and trust her. With a nice
sense of fitness she lights herself about the Catacombs with a torch instead of
the electric lamps that are now so common.</p>
<p>That reversion to torches is quite typical …</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was doing some research at work for tracing and observability for microservices, when I came across <a href="https://pixielabs.ai/">Pixielabs</a>. This tool advertises that you can instantly troubleshoot applications without any instrumentation or special code inside the apps, which sounded ✨magical✨ to me. So naturally I wanted to know a little more about what enables this technology to work, and after scrolling through the site, under the “No Instrumentation” section was this acronym <strong>eBPF</strong>.</p><p>After some further digging on the internet, reading the <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf">design papers</a> and watching several videos, it was safe to say this technology caught my attention, so I wanted to write some notes on it and I hope this post will spark some further interest in you as well.</p><h2 id="so-what-is-ebpf-exactly">So what is eBPF exactly?</h2><p>The TL;DR version is that this technology enables sandboxed user space applications to run in the Linux kernel itself. In a way it makes the kernel <em>programmable</em> which unlocks tremendous possibilities.</p><p>You can pick <strong>any function</strong> from the kernel and execute the program every time that function runs. Running a program that “attaches” to network sockets, tracepoints and perf events can be extremely useful. Developers can debug the kernel without having to re-compile it. There are plenty of use cases such as:</p><ul><li>Application performance &amp; troubleshooting</li><li>Networking &amp; security</li><li>Runtime security</li><li>Application tracing</li><li>Observability</li></ul><p>That’s what enables tools like Pixie to do blackbox analysis, without requiring any tinkering inside the applications that we’re trying to debug.</p><p>Originally BPF was <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf">designed</a> for capturing and filtering network packets that matched specific rules, discarding any unwanted packets. That’s why it was called the “Berkeley Packet Filter”. If you’ve ever used <strong>tcpdump</strong> you’ve probably already used it. Nowadays eBPF can be used for many different things and not just packet filtering but the name stuck for some reason.</p><p>This architecture of network monitoring was vastly superior to the current existing packet capture technologies in terms of performance, mainly because the filtering was done in the kernel instead of copying all of the packets in user space and doing
the calculations there. But with the advancement of processors it didn’t hold up so well with it’s initial design. That’s why the <strong>extended BPF</strong> (eBPF) design was introduced, to take advantage of the modern processing power.</p><p>Initially eBPF was to be also used as a network packet filtering solution, but the ability to run user-space programs inside the kernel proved to be very powerful. The new design extended what the BPF virtual machine could do, which was to allow it to run on all kinds of events, not just packets, and also do certain actions instead of just the ability to filter things.</p><h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2><p>An eBPF program is just a sequence of 64-bit instructions. The virtual machine’s instruction set is fairly limited and it has two goals in mind:</p><ol><li>The code needs to be executed as fast as possible.</li><li>All BPF instructions must be verifiable at load time to ensure the safety of the kernel.</li></ol><p>Okay so, eBPF code is run in a safe virtual machine inside the kernel. Writing these programs is done with the help of some frameworks (like <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc">bcc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace">bpftrace</a>) and the program bytecode is then loaded via the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html"><code>bpf</code></a> system call.</p><p>To nullify the security and stability risks when running a user space program inside the kernel, several checks are performed
to ensure that the code we run is safe and that it terminates so our computer won’t freeze up.</p><p>Firstly, to even be able to run a user program which loads eBPF code, it needs root privileges to do so, unless unprivileged eBPF is enabled, in which case the process can load a program with a reduced functionality. Secondly, there’s the eBPF verifier which all eBPF programs must go through before they can be executed.</p><p>The verifier runs several checks on the code that safeguards the kernel. The first check ensures that any unbounded
loops which could freeze up the kernel are prohibited. The second check, which is more extensive, simulates the execution of the code making sure that all paths of the code run to completion, no out of bounds memory is accessed and overall the state of the virtual machine is valid.</p><p>The last step of the verification process involves restricting the eBPF program abilities, which kernel functions are callable and which data it can access. The verifier knows how to apply those restrictions because of the <strong>program type</strong>. The program type is determined when we associate the program with a certain event.</p><p>After the verification process is done, the BPF bytecode is then interpreted, or compiled by a JIT compiler, into native instructions that run efficiently whenever an event happens in the kernel.</p><h2 id="kprobes--uprobes">kprobes &amp; uprobes</h2><p>We can create and insert kernel probes or kprobes for short to virtually any function in the kernel, and attach an eBPF program so that it executes each time that function is invoked.</p><p>Here’s a simple hello world example from the <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/tree/master/examples">bcc</a> repository:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> bcc <span>import</span> BPF

</code></pre></div><p>The eBPF program is written in a pseudo-C code and it’s placed in the variable <code>prog</code> as a string. The bcc framework does all the heavy lifting of generating the bytecode, loading the programs and all that stuff, which makes writing these programs a bit easier.</p><p>In this example, the hello function invokes a bpf helper function called <code>bpf_trace_printk</code> which outputs a “Hello, World!” trace. Then we load the program and we attach a kernel probe for the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html"><code>clone</code></a> event, basically saying that we want to call the <code>hello</code> program each time <code>clone</code> is called.</p><p>After that the script waits for new traces to arrive, fetches the fields and prints the values to the screen.</p><p>Let’s try running it:</p><pre><code>$ sudo python3 hello-ebpf.py
TIME(s)            COMM             PID    MESSAGE
</code></pre><p>The script has successfully loaded the program and now we wait for the traces to arrive. The next thing to do is to try and invoke the <code>clone</code> syscall. We can run any command on the terminal, such as <code>ls</code> and a child process will be created. Since I had firefox running, it created some child processes in the meantime and traces started to show up:</p><pre><code>611.247475000      firefox          5378   Hello, World!
</code></pre><p>As we can see, the message “Hello, World!” is printed on the screen along with the other trace fields. Super cool!</p><p>Besides attaching to kernel functions, we could also observe functions invoked in user space, such as <strong>malloc</strong> or <strong>strlen</strong>. This is possible via another Linux kernel feature - <strong>uprobes</strong>.</p><p>Here’s an interesting script that counts frequencies of strings by tracing strlen() and using a hash map to store the strings along with the count of their recurrence: <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/examples/tracing/strlen_count.py">https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/examples/tracing/strlen_count.py</a></p><h2 id="helper-functions">helper functions</h2><p>Since arbitrary kernel functions are prohibited to be called by ebpf programs, there are several helper functions which the kernel provides for us, such as the <code>bpf_trace_printk</code> function. We can use them to:</p><ul><li>Get the current time</li><li>Interact with eBPF maps</li><li>Manipulate network packets</li><li>Print debugging messages</li></ul><p>Note that each program can only use a subset of these helpers because of the different contexts the programs can run in. Here’s the extensive <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/bpf-helpers.7.html">list</a> of bpf helpers.</p><h2 id="map-storage">map storage</h2><p>To write more complicated programs you’ll need some type of data store, and that is where <strong>maps</strong> come in. They are an important part of the BPF internal system, which allows programs to store information that can be accessed from userspace.</p><p>BPF supports different <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/docs/reference_guide.md#maps">types</a> of data stores - you can use a hash map, an array, or even a stack or a queue, depending on the use case of course.</p><h2 id="conclusion">conclusion</h2><p>eBPF opens up all kinds of possibilities for observability. You can treat a system as a blackbox, without really knowing anything about it, and run all kinds of interesting analysis: count the most frequently called functions, trace network packets, do performance tracing and debugging, etc.</p><p>There are a myriad of tools that you can use to observe every component of the system: the CPU, memory, file system, networking, containers, applications…</p><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b19abde4b1ccfe4ce140969c8bf44f39d1c2fe70/f9ed3/images/ebpf/bcc_tracing_tools_early2019.png" alt="ebpf-tracing-tools"><figcaption>BCC performance tools (courtesy of Brendan Gregg)</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve only scratched the surface on this subject and I can’t wait to learn more about it, as well as Linux performance in general.

<p>In the intensive care unit, patients receive treatment and therapies to prevent them from immediately dying. It’s not pleasant, but it’s true. You don’t want to come see us. </p>



<p>We see the signs and messages. “Thank you, Frontline Workers!” Honestly, it’s confusing. We aren’t your frontline. We are your last resort. And, after eight months, we are tired. Nurses are <a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201804-269PS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">burnt out</a>. Some organizations <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2516043520957565" target="_blank">did not take care of their employees</a> well when COVID hit. Many nurses are leaving their jobs. Most units are experiencing staffing crises. There just simply aren’t enough nurses to take care of all of you. You don’t want to visit the ICU during normal circumstances. You certainly don’t want to be a patient in one now.</p>



<p>ICU beds usually run at about 70-80% capacity. It’s a sweet spot where the unit can function from an operational standpoint while still having bed availability for emergencies or cyclical unit flow. With the first wave of COVID, some ICUs were operating at 200-300% capacity. The bed crisis in itself wasn’t a huge one. A bed is a bed is a bed. Organizations simply <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sccm.org/Blog/March-2020/United-States-Resource-Availability-for-COVID-19" target="_blank">opened more ICUs</a> in other areas of the hospital. It wasn’t pretty or comfortable, but it worked.</p>



<p>The real crisis came with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/19/covid19-hospitals-in-half-the-states-facing-massive-staffing-shortage/" target="_blank">staff</a>. Who was going to take care of all of these extra patients? Organizations employed many strategies. Nurses managed ICU patients <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aacnjournals.org/ccnonline/article/40/4/25/31008/Answering-the-Call-Impact-of-Tele-ICU-Nurses" target="_blank">remotely,</a> sometimes from other states. Hospitals sought help from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://khn.org/news/highly-paid-traveling-nurses-fill-staffing-shortages-during-covid-pandemic/" target="_blank">staffing agencies</a> and per diem staff. Non-ICU nurses were quickly “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rcni.com/nursing-standard/careers/career-advice/covid-19-what-to-expect-if-you-are-deployed-to-a-critical-care-setting-159646" target="_blank">upskilled</a>” to the critical care setting. In short, an already precarious situation just became even more dangerous.</p>



<p>Nurses new to the ICU setting usually go through an intense training program which includes classroom and clinical experience and ranges from three to six months in length. Upon completion of this program, they are still novice nurses and rely on their <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://healthresearchfunding.org/patricia-benner-novice-to-expert-nursing-theory-explained/" target="_blank">expert</a> colleagues for mentoring and guidance. As crucial as upskilled nurses are, they are still short on education, knowledge, and experience. In our current climate, nurses are working in unfamiliar environments, with a team they don’t know, with fewer resources, fewer experienced staff, and with higher staffing ratios. All of this can and will lead to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://psnet.ahrq.gov/primer/nursing-and-patient-safety" target="_blank">unfavorable outcomes</a>.</p>



<p>COVID has now been around long enough that we are somewhat in a clinical routine. The patient H&amp;P’s (history and physical) are eerily similar. “Patient attended a family birthday party.” “Patient attended weekly bowling league.” “Masks were not worn.” “Attendees did not appropriately socially distance.” By the time the patient gets to us, they are in bad shape. </p>



<p>They can not breathe without the help of a ventilator. Breathing on a ventilator is very uncomfortable and unnatural. Lung injury in COVID is so profound that patients usually require the most extreme settings, which require heavy sedation and paralytics. If the patient still isn’t ventilating adequately, we will <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjKpvGr4KntAhUo2FkKHR_-DwoQFjAAegQIAhAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjamanetwork.com%2Fjournals%2Fjama%2Ffullarticle%2F2769872&amp;usg=AOvVaw2mk45rzzxRWxBCOd7Thav5" target="_blank">prone</a> them.

If they spike an uncontrollable fever, we will put them on an ice blanket. We will bring iPads into the room and update families on the phone. The patient will be alone.</p>



<p>All of this will either work, or it won’t. The average ICU length of stay is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://journals.lww.com/healthcaremanagerjournal/Abstract/2014/04000/Reduction_of_Intensive_Care_Unit_Length_of_Stay_.5.aspx#:~:text=The%20average%20ICU%20length%20of%20stay%20%28LOS%29%20is,an%20additional%201.5%20days%20in%20a%20non-ICU%20bed" target="_blank">3.3 days</a>. The average ICU length of stay with COVID is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-020-01726-3" target="_blank">19 days</a>. Prior to COVID, over half of ICU patients experienced <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.posticu.org/" target="_blank">post intensive care syndrome (PICS)</a> after their discharge. This syndrome includes depression, anxiety, and cognitive deficits, sometimes limiting their ability to work or care for themselves. The after-effects of an ICU admission with COVID have not yet been studied. Those who don’t get better, will die.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Let's talk about objects in functional languages.</p>

<p>This could be a sticking point, so I'll get this out of the way up-front: I find arguments over whether such-and-such a thing is “really” functional or “really” imperative or “really” object-oriented to be for the most part frustrating and useless. A lot of these arguments boil down to value judgments in disguise (a thing I've touched on in the past when <a href="https://journal.infinitenegativeutility.com/proofs-and-programs-and-rhetoric" rel="nofollow">talking about the rhetorical emphasis placed on math in programming</a>) and many of the rest turn out to be based on informal definitions where 'functional' means 'like my favorite or first functional language'.<sup id="fnref:samp"><a href="#fn:samp" rel="nofollow">1</a></sup> I prefer to think about these concept less in terms of necessary criteria and hard lines, and more in terms of influence and approach and focus.</p>

<p>The paper <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~wcook/Drafts/2009/essay.pdf" rel="nofollow"><em>On Understanding Data Abstraction Revisited</em> by William Cook</a> (itself a paper that revisits <a href="http://lucacardelli.name/Papers/OnUnderstanding.A4.pdf" rel="nofollow"><em>On understanding data types, data abstraction, and polymorphism</em> by Luca Cardelli and Peter Wegner</a>) lays out simple definitions of the often-used concepts of “abstract data type” and “object”. His definition of “object” is, of course, not the only one, but I think it's a useful one. Importantly, Cook's definition is based on abstract criteria that can apply even when the language itself does not have an explicit concept of an “object”. To emphasize this, I'm going to use Haskell in this blog post to demonstrate a pure functional variation on “object-oriented programming”<sup id="fnref:lang"><a href="#fn:lang" rel="nofollow">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Beyond being a useful definition, Cook's formulation is also a valuable design pattern, one which has both advantages and disadvantages when designing programs. Consequently, the goal of this blog post is twofold: first, to show how “objects” can (under some definition) exist in a language like Haskell which has no built-in notion of “object-oriented programming”, and secondly, to show the advantages and disadvantages of code written in this style.</p>



<p>Cook's definition of an <em>abstract data type</em> is a type that</p>

<blockquote><p>[…] has a public name, a hidden representation, and operations to create, combine, and observe values of the abstraction.</p></blockquote>

<p>To use a simplified version of his example, here's a (not terribly efficient) way of defining a “set of integers” in Haskell as an abstract data type. In this case, we've got an <code>IntSet</code> type whose representation can be easily hidden, because the operations that a consumer of this library cares about about have been defined in terms of that abstract representation.</p>

<pre><code>-- we'll export `IntSet` but not the constructors
data IntSet
  = SetEmpty
  | SetInsert Int IntSet

empty :: IntSet
empty = SetEmpty

isEmpty :: IntSet -&gt; Bool
isEmpty SetEmpty = True
isEmpty _ = False

insert :: Int -&gt; IntSet -&gt; IntSet
insert x set
  | contains set x = set
  | otherwise = SetInsert x set

contains :: IntSet -&gt; Int -&gt; Bool
contains SetEmpty x = False
contains (SetInsert y rest) x
  | x == y = True
  | otherwise = contains rest x
</code></pre>

<p>This is probably not a terribly controversial definition or design: it's a pretty typical one for most functional languages! …well, it might be controversial to <em>use</em> since it's got awful algorithmic performance, but it's fairly unobjectionable as a teaching tool, at least.</p>

<p>What would a user see when looking at the documentation for this module? Since we're not exporting the constructors for <code>IntSet</code>, it'll look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>data IntSet
empty :: IntSet
isEmpty :: IntSet -&gt; Bool
insert :: Int -&gt; IntSet -&gt; IntSet
contains :: Int -&gt; IntSet -&gt; Bool
</code></pre>

<p>The ability to hide the definition of <code>IntSet</code> is the thing that makes this an abstract data type. A user of the library doesn't care—and ideally doesn't <em>need</em> to care—what constructors hide behind that <code>IntSet</code>.</p>



<p>Cook then goes on to describe “objects”. Here's another (equally inefficient) implementation of <code>IntSet</code>, which I'll define as <code>OIntSet</code> so I can easily refer to both:</p>

<pre><code>data OIntSet = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty :: Bool
  , oContains :: Int -&gt; Bool
  }

oEmpty :: OIntSet
oEmpty = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty = True
  , oContains = \_ -&gt; False
  }

oInsert :: Int -&gt; OIntSet -&gt; OIntSet
oInsert x set
  | oContains set x = set
  | otherwise = OIntSet
      { oIsEmpty = False
      , oContains = \i -&gt; i == x || oContains set i
      }
</code></pre>

<p>It's possible that we can choose our export list carefully so that this implementation of <code>OIntSet</code> reveals the exact same set of operations as the previous one. However, there's a major difference here: <code>OIntSet</code> is not actually hiding a specific type. Instead, it just bundles the relevant set of operations inside of a record of functions, which acts like an interface type. In both the ADT-based approach and the “object”-based approach, a user does not know about the internal representation of <code>OIntSet</code>, but in the ADT approach, this is because there exists a single representation which is non-public, while in the “object”-based approach, there may be multiple separate implementations that are indistinguishable.</p>



<p>An “object”-like representation allows for a vast amount of flexibility. Because a consumer of an <code>OIntSet</code> can use any value as long as the value has provided implementations of the relevant “methods”, we can easily and conveniently define new instances of <code>OIntSet</code> that have radically different internal representations. For example, we can define infinite sets that use simple numerical computations to define their <code>oContains</code> method, like this set of all even numbers:</p>

<pre><code>oEvenNumbers :: OIntSet
oEvenNumbers = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty = False
  , oContains = \i -&gt; i `mod` 2 == 0
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Or we could construct <code>OIntSet</code> values that use a different data representation, such as a list, to store the members of the set:</p>

<pre><code>oFromList :: [Int] -&gt; OIntSet
oFromList list = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty = null list
  , oContains = \i -&gt; i `elem` list
  }
</code></pre>

<p>But even though these <code>OIntSet</code> definitions use different underlying data representations, they expose the same interface, so we can use the same operations to manipulate them. For example, we can define an <code>oUnion</code> operation which computes the union of two <code>OIntSet</code> objects, since that operation is easily expressible in terms of <code>oIsEmpty</code> and <code>oContains</code>:</p>

<pre><code>oUnion :: OIntSet -&gt; OIntSet -&gt; OIntSet
oUnion set set' = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty = oIsEmpty set &amp;&amp; oIsEmpty set'
  , oContains = \i -&gt; oContains set i || oContains set' i
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Our <code>oUnion</code> operation—indeed, any operation we define—can work on any two <code>OIntSet</code>s even if they have wildly different internal representations. We can even use this to combine all of our previously-defined <code>OIntSet</code> constructors into one expression, to create a set that uses a combination of Haskell lists, numeric predicates, and closures to represent a set:</p>

<pre><code>sample :: OIntSet
sample = oInsert 1 oEvenNumbers `oUnion` oFromList [10..20]
</code></pre>

<p>This is a very convenient way of building certain abstractions. By building around external interfaces, you can include varying data representations that easily work together.</p>

<p>This example is clearly a little bit contrived, so it's probably worth giving some other “real-world” examples where this design approach is useful. Object-oriented programming is generally cited as a good fit for a particular style of user interface programming, because it allows you to define classes of “widgets” that expose a common interface but have different internal representations. You could build a Haskell GUI library in this style by defining <code>Widgets</code> as “objects” with a common interface, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>data Widget = Widget
  { drawWidget :: Ctx -&gt; Position -&gt; IO ()
  , handleEvent :: Event -&gt; IO ()
  }
</code></pre>

<p>This is similar to the approach taken by the <a href="https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick/" rel="nofollow">Brick TUI library</a>, which has <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/brick-0.54/docs/Brick-Types.html#t:Widget" rel="nofollow">its own <code>Widget</code> record</a>.</p>



<p>One major concern with this style of data representation is performance and optimization. Consider our original ADT representation for <code>IntSet</code>: it's inefficient, yes, but we can make it more efficient in a number of ways. For example, we could modify it so that, instead of always inserting new elements “at the front”, we can instead insert them in such a way that the internal representation of the set is always sorted lowest-to-highest. This means that we may no longer have to traverse the entire list to check for element membership. Even better, we might swap out the list-like representation for a binary tree representation, maybe doing some rebalancing in certain cases.</p>

<p>There is no way <em>in general</em> to apply these optimizations to the <code>OIntSet</code>-style program. You could define an <code>OIntSet</code> that sits in front of a balanced tree and therefore has faster lookup and insertion, but once it's sitting behind the interface, you no longer have access to those internals. You cannot, for example, write an <code>oUnion</code> operation that rebalances the binary trees behind the two sets it's operating on: it doesn't even know if both sets <em>are</em> backed by trees!</p>

<p>In effect, the major selling point of the “object”-style design here is also a major downside: you don't have guarantees about the specific representation of data, which means your programs can easily mix-and-match different representations, but it also means that your program can't make use of representation-specific knowledge in ways that are advantageous.</p>

<p>There's another major concern as well, and that's that the specific choice of “object” representation can make a big difference in terms of what operations you can and cannot support. Look back at <code>OIntSet</code>—I was able to define <code>oUnion</code>, but what about <code>oIntersection</code>? It turns out that it's not actually possible using the specific representation I've chosen<sup id="fnref:perf"><a href="#fn:perf" rel="nofollow">3</a></sup>:</p>

<pre><code>oIntersection :: OIntSet -&gt; OIntSet -&gt; OIntSet
oIntersection set set' = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty = {- ??? -}
  , oIntersection = \i -&gt; oContains set i &amp;&amp; oContains set' i
  }
</code></pre>

<p>How do I implement <code>oIsEmpty</code>? I might naïvely try to write the inverse of <code>oUnion</code> and define it as <code>oIsEmpty set || oIsEmpty set'</code>, but that's not at all what I want: the intersection of the set of even numbers and the set of odd numbers is an empty set, but neither the even nor the odd numbers are empty, so this would incorrectly compute their …</p></div></div>

    <p><a href="https://nns.ee/blog/2019/03/21/chroot-shenanigans.html">In my previous post</a>, I described running Arch on an OpenWRT router. Today, I’ll be taking it a step further and running Arch and a full LXDE installation natively on an Amazon Kindle, which can be interacted with directly using the touch screen. This is possible thanks to the Kindle’s operating system being Linux!
<!--description--></p>

<p>You can see the end result in action <a href="https://youtu.be/Bx386xpDqCY">here</a>. Apologies for the shaky video - it was shot using my phone and no tripod.</p>

<p>If you’re wanting to follow along, make sure you’ve <a href="https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/5_x_Jailbreak">rooted your Kindle</a> beforehand. This is essential – without it, it’s impossible to run custom scripts or binaries.</p>

<p>I’m testing this on an 8th generation Kindle (KT3) – it should, however, work for all recent Kindles given you’ve enough storage and are rooted. You also need to set up <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=225030">USBnetwork</a> for SSH access and optionally <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=203326">KUAL</a> if you want a simple way of launching the chroot.</p>

<p>First things first: We need to set up a filesystem and extract an Arch installation into it, which we can later chroot into. The filesystem will be a file which will be mounted as a loop device. The reason why we’re not extracting the Arch installation directly into a directory on the Kindle is because the Kindle’s storage filesystem is FAT32. FAT32 doesn’t support required features such as symbolic links, which would break the Arch installation. Please note that this also means that your chroot filesystem can be 4 gigabytes large, at maximum. This can be worked around by mounting the real root inside the chroot filesystem, which it’s still a hacky way to go about it. But I digress.</p>

<p>First, figure out how large your filesystem actually can be. SSH into your Kindle and see how much free space you have:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>ssh root@192.168.15.244
<span>
</span><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>df</span> <span>-k</span> /mnt/base-us
<span>Filesystem   1K-blocks  Used    Available  Use%  Mounted on
/dev/loop/0  3188640    361856  2826784    11%   /mnt/base-us
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Seems like we have around 2800000K (around 2.8G) of space available. Let’s make our filesystem 2.6G – it’s enough to host our root filesystem and some extra applications, such as LXDE. Note that I’ll be running the following commands on my PC and transferring the filesystem over later. You can also do all of this on the Kindle, but it’s simply easier and faster this way.</p>

<p>Let’s create a blank file of the wanted size. I’m using <code>dd</code>, but you can also use <code>fallocate</code> for this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span><span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>arch.img <span>bs</span><span>=</span>1024 <span>count</span><span>=</span>2600000
<span>2600000+0 records in
2600000+0 records out
2662400000 bytes (2.7 GB, 2.5 GiB) copied, 6.92058 s, 385 MB/s
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s create our filesystem on it. Since we’re doing this on the PC, we need make it 32bit and disable the <code>metadata_csum</code> and <code>huge_file</code> options on the filesystem, as the Kindle’s ext4 kernel doesn’t support them.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>mkfs.ext4 <span>-O</span> ^64bit,^metadata_csum,^huge_file arch.img
<span>mke2fs 1.45.0 (6-Mar-2019)
Discarding device blocks: done                            
Creating filesystem with 650000 4k blocks and 162560 inodes
Filesystem UUID: a4e72620-368a-44b4-81bb-9e66b2903523
Superblock backups stored on blocks: 
	32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912

Allocating group tables: done                            
Writing inode tables: done                            
Creating journal (16384 blocks): done
Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done 
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is optional, but I’ll also disable periodic filesystem checks on it:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>tune2fs <span>-c</span> 0 <span>-i</span> 0 arch.img                               
<span>tune2fs 1.45.0 (6-Mar-2019)         
Setting maximal mount count to -1
Setting interval between checks to 0 seconds
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next it’s time to mount the filesystem:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span><span>mkdir </span>rootfs
<span>$</span><span> </span><span>sudo </span>mount <span>-o</span> loop arch.img rootfs/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Kindle I’m using has a Cortex-A9-based processor, so let’s download the ARMv7 version of Arch Linux ARM from <a href="http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-armv7-latest.tar.gz">here</a>. You can download it and extract then, or simply download and extract at the same time:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>curl <span>-L</span> http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-armv7-latest.tar.gz | <span>sudo tar </span>xz <span>-C</span> rootfs/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>sudo</code> is required to extract as it sets up a lot of files with root permissions. You can ignore the errors about <code>SCHILY.fflags</code>. Verify that the files extracted successfully with <code>ls -l rootfs/</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s prepare our Kindle for the filesystem. I opted for hosting the filesystem in <code>extensions/karch</code> as I want to use KUAL for easy launching:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>ssh root@192.168.15.244
<span>
</span><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> /mnt/base-us/extensions/karch
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While we’re here, it’s also a good idea to stop the power daemon to prevent the Kindle from going into sleep mode while transferring the filesystem and interrupting our transfer:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span>stop powerd
<span>powerd stop/waiting
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s transfer our filesystem:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>exit</span>
<span>Connection to 192.168.15.244 closed.

</span><span>$</span><span> </span>scp arch.img root@192.168.15.244:/mnt/base-us/extensions/karch/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This might take quite a bit of time, depending on your connection.</p>

<p>Once it’s done, let’s SSH in once again and set up our mountpoint:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>ssh root@192.168.15.244
<span>
</span><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>cd</span> /mnt/base-us/extensions/karch/
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>mkdir </span>system
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I decided to set up my own loop device, so I can have it named, but you can ignore this and opt to use <code>/dev/loop/12</code> or similar instead. Just make sure it’s already not in use with <code>mount</code>.</p>

<p>Setting up a loop point and mounting the filesystem:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>mknod</span> <span>-m0660</span> /dev/loop/karch b 7 250
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>loop</span><span>=</span>/dev/loop/karch <span>-t</span> ext4 arch.img system/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We should also mount some system directories into it:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>bind</span> /dev system/dev
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>bind</span> /dev/pts system/dev/pts
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>bind</span> /proc system/proc
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>bind</span> /sys system/sys
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>bind</span> /tmp system/tmp
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>cp</span> /etc/hosts system/etc/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s time to chroot into our new system and set it up for LXDE. You can also use this opportunity to set up whatever applications you need, such as an onscreen keyboard:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>chroot </span>system/ /bin/bash
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>echo</span> <span>'en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8'</span> <span>&gt;</span> /etc/locale.gen 
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>locale-gen
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>rm</span> /etc/resolv.conf 
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>echo</span> <span>'nameserver 8.8.8.8'</span> <span>&gt;</span> /etc/resolv.conf
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>pacman-key <span>--init</span> <span># this will take a while</span>
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>pacman-key <span>--populate</span>
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>pacman <span>-Syu</span> <span>--noconfirm</span>
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>pacman <span>-S</span> lxde xorg-server-xephyr <span>--noconfirm</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We use Xephyr because it’s the easiest way to get our LXDE session up and running. Since the Kindle uses X11 natively, we can try using that. It’s possible to stop the native window manager using <code>stop lab126_gui</code> outside the chroot, but then the Kindle will stop updating the screen with new data, leaving it blank – forcing you to use something like <code>eips</code> to refresh the screen. The X server still works, however, and you can confirm this by using something like <code>x11vnc</code> after running your own WM in it. Xephyr spawns a new X server inside the preexisting X server, which is not as efficient but a lot easier.</p>

<p>We can however stop everything else related to the native GUI, as we need the extra memory and we can’t use it while LXDE is running anyways:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>exit</span>
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>SERVICES</span><span>=</span><span>"framework pillow webreader kb contentpackd"</span>
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>for </span>service <span>in</span> <span>${</span><span>SERVICES</span><span>}</span><span>;</span> <span>do </span>stop <span>${</span><span>service</span><span>}</span><span>;</span> <span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While we’re here, we need to get the screen size for later:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span>eips <span>-i</span> | <span>grep</span> <span>'xres:'</span> | <span>awk</span> <span>'{print $2"x"$4}'</span>
<span>600x800
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s chroot back into the system and see if we can get LXDE to run. Be sure to replace the screen size parameter if needed:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>chroot </span>system/ /bin/bash
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>export </span><span>DISPLAY</span><span>=</span>:0
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>Xephyr :1 <span>-title</span> <span>"L:A_N:application_ID:xephyr"</span> <span>-screen</span> 600x800 <span>-cc</span> 4 <span>-nocursor</span> &amp;
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>export </span><span>DISPLAY</span><span>=</span>:1
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>lxsession &amp;
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>xrandr <span>-o</span> right
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If everything goes well, you should have LXDE visible on your Kindle’s screen. Ta-da! Feel free to play around with it. I’ve found that the touch screen is suprisingly accurate, even though it is using an IR LED system to detect touches instead of a normal digitizer.</p>

<p>Once done in the chroot, Ctrl-C + Ctrl-D can be issued to exit the chroot. We can then restore the Kindle UI by doing:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>for </span>service <span>in</span> <span>${</span><span>SERVICES</span><span>}</span><span>;</span> <span>do </span>start <span>${</span><span>service</span><span>}</span><span>;</span> <span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It might take a while for anything to display again.</p>

<p>I’ve mentioned setting up a KUAL extension to automate the entering and exiting of the chroot. You can find that <a href="https://github.com/neonsea/karch">here</a>. If you’re interested in using this, make sure you’ve set up your filesystem first and copied it over to the same directory as the extension, and that it’s named <code>arch.img</code>. Everything else is not mandatory - the extension will do it for you.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>The building did not stand out. Unremarkable industrial building, which was built in hundreds of Soviet cities.<span id="more-10215"></span></p>
<p>Non-broken glass, burning lights, live plants inside, modern plastic entrance doors. Except for one floor.</p>
<!-- WP QUADS Content Ad Plugin v. 2.0.17.1 -->


<p>Despite the twilight, the floor remained lifelessly dark. Somewhere in the depths, there was a dim glow of electric light, hardly penetrating through old glass blocks.</p>
<p>Inside the floor was empty and black, but not completely.&nbsp;Inside burned several fluorescent lamps, spotlighting dozens of silhouettes of tall cabinets.</p>
<p>Some of them were covered with darkened translucent film.</p>
<p>The surface of the floor, tables and enclosures covered with black spots of soot, sometimes diluted with white stains of dried extinguishing mixture.</p>
<p>The air felt a persistent, but not strong smell of burning.&nbsp;The fire walked here a few years ago but did not touch the equipment.</p>
<p>Part of the cabinets were antique electronic computers. Others served to measure signals, and computers controlled this process. Dozens of terminals froze on the tables with extinct screens.</p>

<p>Suddenly it became clear that before them the legendary machine “Saratov-2”.&nbsp;The machine, which was massively placed on many enterprises of the Soviet Union in the 70s, but at the same time, not a single high-quality (I’m not talking about color) photos remained. Not on the Internet, not even in the museum of the enterprise developer.</p>

<p>This computer did not even have a traditional microprocessor. Domestic clone of the popular American PDP-8, Saratov-2 was produced in two versions.</p>
<p>Steel frame, like a chest of drawers, filled with drawers.&nbsp;Different boxes responded to various computer nodes — a twelve-bit computing unit, input-output device interfaces, and RAM.</p>
<p>The memory was ferromagnetic – two boxes of four cubes in each. Reading or writing programs occurred through punched tapes, and to display the results of calculations used electric typewriter CONSUL-260.</p>
<p>The monitor and keyboard in that era were not yet a much-needed</p>
<p>part of the computer. The necessary input of programs into the operative memory was carried out in binary codes, manually using a group of switches on the front panel. Bulbs controlled the correctness of the input.</p>

<p>The next generation of computers was Electronics 100/25. These machines were clones of American PDP-11.</p>
<p>They thought faster, had more memory, allowed them to work with magnetic tape drives and punched tapes, but the general principle remained the same.</p>
<p>It was possible to connect a monitor and a keyboard to this computer, while still having the ability to enter programs through the front switches.</p>

<p>Electronics-60 – the further development of Electronics 100/25. The same architecture, but bulky tape drives are a thing of the past.</p>
<p>They were replaced by flexible eight-inch floppy disks. The new chipset, allowed to fit the processor module, power supply and control devices, in a very compact size.</p>
<p>I note that all these computers were managers, that is, they worked with a bunch of external equipment. It could be machine tools, laboratory complexes, measuring devices.</p>

<p>15VM16-1 some early version of Electronics-60, having a control panel of light bulbs and switches. Assembled on the element base of the previous Electronics 100/25. I occupied a small nightstand built into the table on which the controlled equipment was placed.</p>

<p>DVK-2M or Interactive Computing Complex. Massive, stylish in appearance, the computer of the 80s, which could be considered a personal computer.</p>
<p>It consisted of two desktop blocks – processor and pairing. A set of interchangeable interface cards allowed connecting drives of various types, a monochrome monitor on an openwork leg, and a keyboard.</p>
<p>Back in 1993, when we were studying, one teaching DVK could distribute programs for a couple of dozen Spectrums through the network.</p>

        <div>

          

<div>
<div><p><a href="https://www.pcjs.org/software/pcx86/app/other/visicalc/1981/"><img alt="VisiCalc" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/visicalc.jpg"></a></p>
</div>
<p>
Spreadsheets attract people with a hacker mindset, since they reward a
little technical curiosity with a big jump in capability. Despite
that, while there are some open source spreadsheet projects, most of
the action is closed source (Excel, Airtable, Honeycode, etc). Grist is a solid,
modern, powerful spreadsheet that fits well into the open-source
ecology, and is as friendly to hacker-developers as it is to
hacker-users. Here are some reasons why.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><img alt="Linked sections" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/links.webp"></p>
<p>
Grist borrows visually from classic spreadsheets and modern
dashboards, with every view backed by relational data, filtered and
linked with other views as needed. Grist takes care of the data, and keeping
it live, so custom views are easy to add if you need something new,
using <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/widget-custom/#minimal-example">standard HTML/JS/CSS</a>. For example, live-updating
<a href="https://support.getgrist.com/examples/2020-08-invoices/">invoices</a>,
<a href="https://support.getgrist.com/examples/2020-10-print-labels/">mailing labels</a>,
<a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/iqhzhQM66qg7/Pedigree-Example/m/fork/p/2#a1.s3.r11.c2">goat pedigrees</a>,
 <a href="https://public.getgrist.com/doc/exoplanets/m/fork">exoplanet birthday card</a>,
 or <a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/qctFijX9HUZu/Morse-Code/m/fork/p/2">morse code quizzer</a> that look just how you want them.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><img alt="datasette" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/datasette.png"></p>
<p>
Grist is a <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/exports/#backing-up-an-entire-document">self-contained format</a>, based on SQLite. Grist tables
are literally SQLite tables, which opens up all sorts of possibilities.
For example, I can take a Grist
<a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/doc/investment-research">example investment spreadsheet</a>
and publish it using Simon Willison’s <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette">datasette</a>
as a <a href="https://candy-tourmaline-efraasia.glitch.me/data/Investments">Glitch remix</a>
without any conversion steps needed. This is a step up from exporting CSV.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><img alt="python formulas" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/spots-left.png"></p>
<p>
Grist uses <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/functions/">python as its formula language</a>. Python has a good standard
library, nice syntax for working with lists, and is a favorite of data
scientists. Grist itself is written in TypeScript, with formula
evaluation isolated in a sandbox.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><img alt="data diff" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/diff.png"></p>

<p>
The Grist format makes it easy to find the most recent common ancestor
of two versions of a document, facilitating three-way comparisons and
git-style revision control. When working on a Grist spreadsheet with someone,
you can use real-time collaborative editing -
or you may sometimes prefer to
<a href="https://support.getgrist.com/copying-docs/#trying-out-changes">“fork” your spreadsheet</a>,
make a set of changes,
<a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/syx4YUwXdDyP/NYC-Bridges?compare=syx4YUwXdDyPELJUEqShA9~o4CKdSVuVQfGbyHCXctpqV~4">compare them with the original</a>
and then land them back.  We’re excited to flesh this workflow
out, and I think any programmer can see where we’re going with it.

<p>
Grist code is available at <a href="https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core">github.com/gristlabs/grist-core</a>
under a standard free and open source licence (Apache 2.0).
Grist software is developed by Grist Labs, which offers <a href="https://www.getgrist.com/pricing">free and paid
hosting plans</a>. Whether you choose us to host your spreadsheets,
or to run Grist yourself, you have the comfort of knowing the developers have revenue
(so they won’t one day vanish in the morning sun like an elusive gleam of dew on a flower),
and you have the code and your data (ditto).

<div>
<p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/ondras/hYfN3/"><img alt="spreadsheet jsfiddle" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/fiddle.png"></a></p>
<p>
“Fiddle” sites are very handy for communicating and learning about a
technology. I know I learned a lot about javascript by playing
with this 30-line implemention of a spreadsheet:
<a href="https://jsfiddle.net/ondras/hYfN3/">https://jsfiddle.net/ondras/hYfN3/</a>. Grist supports fiddles almost by
accident, because you can <a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/">use Grist without logging in</a>,
and you can quickly edit a “fork” of a spreadsheet without changing your original.
Here, try <a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/doc/afterschool-program/m/fork">fiddling with one of our examples</a>. You won’t break it.
</p>
</div>

<p>Grist supports <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/col-types/#attachment-columns">attachments</a>, and those attachments can be downloaded as part of a
single Grist file format.
Grist has solid undo/redo support.
Hosted Grist makes <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/automatic-backups/">automatic backups</a> at hourly, daily, monthly, and yearly intervals.
Grist has <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/rest-api/">an API</a> and a <a href="https://zapier.com/apps/grist/integrations">Zapier integration</a>.
Grist supports real time collaboration.
Grist supports many <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/functions/">Excel functions</a>.
We publish a Grist docker image (see the <a href="https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core#grist">README</a>),
and have an unreleased standalone app for Windows/Mac/Linux that we’ll be bringing
up to date.
</p>

<div>
<div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plimpton_322"><img alt="Plimpton 322 tablet" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/Plimpton322.jpg"></a></p>
</div>

<p>
Spreadsheets have evolved a lot since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plimpton_322">Babylonian times</a>.
In open-source, <a href="http://www.gnumeric.org/">Gnumeric</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice_Calc">Calc</a> are venerable standalone
Excel replacements.
<a href="https://github.com/mengshukeji/Luckysheet">LuckySheet</a> is a shot at a clone of that standalone experience in the browser.
<a href="https://github.com/audreyt/ethercalc/">Ethercalc</a> is a real-time collaborative spreadsheet, developed by
Audrey Tang, now Taiwan’s Digital Minister, extending work they did with Dan Bricklin on SocialCalc.
Evolving further, hybrid spreadsheet-database models are growing in usefulness and
popularity. That's what Grist is, and we are pleased to bring it now
to the open-source community.
</p>
</div>

<p>Spreadsheets have a long tail of features that are “must haves” for someone out there.
We think a quality, open code base is a big help for realizing those features, and having
peace of mind in relying on them.
Just as Babylonian clay tablets were, we hope that Grist will prove a
sturdy data storage and presentation infrastructure that
can survive for years (if not centuries!) to come.
</p>

<p>Come play with <a href="https://www.getgrist.com/">hosted Grist</a>, or
explore and build <a href="https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core">Grist
source code</a>. In either case, we'd be grateful for your feedback at

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-body">
                    <p>In the world we live in, most products compete for the same market: <strong>our attention</strong>.</p>

<p>The usual suspects are facebook, twitter, pinterest, reddit on your phone, netflix, hulu &amp; friends on your other devices.</p>

<p>In the more tolerated category we have personal messaging: imessage, whatsapp &amp; messenger (hey again facebook), and co.</p>

<p>The competition has extended to “workplace productivity” which is sneaky way of saying “social media, but at work”: slack, teams, email.</p>

<p>Companies like slack internally define engagement as minutes spent on slack. Few people would argue that the more minutes they spend on slack, the more successful their day has been. Would you?</p>

<p>None of these companies taken in a vacuum is a big issue, however <strong>together they form a focus absorbing black hole</strong>, 5 minutes of your attention at a time.</p>

<p>These products have become so good at nipping away at our attention, one push notification or red bubble at a time, that there is very little room left for you to be your original self and achieve a state of focus for longer periods of time.</p>

<p>This is a sad state of affairs, but also can be seen as an opportunity! The internet and the tech boom has normalized us humans like nothing ever has. <strong>The new differentiator that matters most is focus</strong>.</p>

<p>How many of us can read a book for 1h or more without checking their phone?</p>

<p>How many of us can produce a deep, original thought?</p>

<p>How many of us can just sit there at a restaurant without whipping the phone out when we are left at a restaurant table alone?</p>

<p><em>A ridiculously small amount.</em></p>

<p>We should pay more attention to this (pardon the pun), and update our behavior.</p>

<p>What are some ways to get back to focus levels that we once achieved? This is a personal question and if you care, I invite you to think about what your answer is.</p>

<p>Robotti 150D has two Kubota diesel engines. One 75 hp engine is for propulsion and the other 75 hp engine is for the PTO and external hydraulics. Robotti navigates using RTK GPS. In the field it carefully operates according to a plan which the farmer makes using Agrointelli route planning software. The software calculates an optimised route for the field. What makes Robotti unique is that it is in many ways very standard and similar to a tractor. It carries the implement in the centre so that it does not swing and is always stabilised. About a dozen units are currently running in Czech Republic, Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium and in Denmark.<br><strong>Availability:</strong> In 2021 Robotti will be operating in most European countries. They will be sold, leased or rented. Sales prices start at € 175,000. In spring a single-engine 75 hp version, the Robotti 75S, will be launched for € 135,000.<br><strong>Watch videos <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEVvBpJ9bdQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_O5OgXwfp4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>AgXeed is launching a track-based agbot autonomous tractor for specialised and standard implements designed for category III rear and category II front hitches. Working widths are up to six metres (depending on the type of implement used) and the track width is up to 3.2 metres. The vehicle is powered by a 156 hp four-cylinder Deutz diesel engine that drives an electric generator to power all actuators (drivetrain, PTO, fan, etc.). Navigation and planning takes place via cloud-based software that automatically generates path planning based on the field’s geofences and machine specifications. The biggest advantage is that the AgXeed AgBot can be used straight from the box. No special implements are required, nor special software on your home computer. AgXeed deliver a ready-to-use ecosystem that avoids compacting the soil by providing very low ground pressure of maximum 0.5 kg/cm².<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Initial sales in the Netherlands, Germany, France and the UK. The company is currently discussing several purchase models (sale and lease) with distribution parties. The starting price will be around € 249,500 depending on the options selected. The focus right now is on finalising the current design for pre-series production in 2021.<br><strong>Watch video <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/qcYR2XaD0UA" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong></p>

<ul><li><strong>Manufacturer: </strong><a href="https://farmdroid.dk/en/welcome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FarmDroid </a>(Denmark)</li><li><strong>Robot(s):</strong> FD20</li><li><strong>Task(s):</strong> fully automatic seeding and weeding</li><li><strong>Development start: </strong>2011</li><li><strong>Pricing:</strong> sells at € 68,000</li><li><strong>Units active: </strong>&gt;100</li></ul>



<p>The solar battery-powered FarmDroid FD20 performs fully automatic seeding and weeding of various crops between rows and in the row (intra-row). From the seeding process the FD20 knows the position of every seed and therefore knows where it subsequently must weed and, just as importantly, where not to weed. The farmer sets the corner points of the field, creating a geofence for the robot to work within. After setting the number of headlands passes and the direction of the rows, the robot runs on RTK GPS from a base station. The robot does not rely on cameras and never needs charging. Over 100 FD20 robots are active in Austria, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland and they have handled over 1,500 ha of sugar beet, onions, green kale, flowers, spinach, canola and beetroot.<br><strong>Availability:</strong> In 2021 it will also be available in France, Italy, Lithuania and Spain. Currently, dedicated implements and tools are being developed for the FD20.<br><strong>Watch video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIqguf1J-38" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</strong></p>

November 30, 2020 | https://seanconnolly.dev/flutter-vs-react-native | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://seanconnolly.dev/flutter-vs-react-native">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Flutter and React Native are the two most popular cross-platform native development frameworks out there. Many articles have been written comparing the two, but <em>none</em> of them can answer the most important question:</p><p>Which is right for <strong>you</strong>?</p><p>In <a href="https://seanconnolly.dev/how-to-make-better-technology-decisions">How to make better technology decisions</a>, you can find details of the evaluation method I am using for this analysis. In short, we are following a 3 step process:</p><ol><li>Identify <strong>options</strong></li><li>Identify and weight <strong>criteria</strong></li><li><strong>Score</strong> each option</li></ol><p>To facilitate this Flutter vs. React Native analysis, I am using the <a href="https://seanconnolly.dev/help-me-decide">Help Me Decide</a> tool, which you should check out if you are not familiar with it.</p><p>This analysis documents my findings from researching and prototyping with Flutter and React Native over approximately a 1 month period. If you are also deciding between these two options, I encourage you to <a href="https://seanconnolly.dev/how-to-make-better-technology-decisions">learn the process</a> and make your own informed decision.</p><h2>Context and bias</h2><p>Before we begin, one thing missing from most articles comparing Flutter and React Native is transparency around the author's <strong>context and bias</strong>. Without knowing these, you can easily be led astray, thinking because a few people made a choice, you should make the same choice. <strong>I am not here to decide for you</strong>, nor should you let anyone else make your decision. I am here to walk you through my process and give you the tools so you can make your own decision.</p><p><strong>Context</strong> describes the circumstances surrounding your evaluation. Are you performing this evaluation on behalf of a team or organization? What do your stakeholders care about? What technology is the team already familiar with? Are there specific requirements that apply to you that may not apply to others?</p><p><strong>Bias</strong> describes presupposed favor or disfavor toward an option. Do you already have an opinion? Have you already worked with one of the options? Did somebody tell you they "heard bad things" about one of them at a conference they attended two years ago?</p><p>The <strong>context</strong> for my evaluation of Flutter vs. React Native is that I am tasked by my employer with researching both frameworks and making a recommendation for our company, a small-medium startup that currently employs 4 native Android/iOS developers and 8 web developers. My stakeholders have a few loosely defined goals. One is to accelerate development of our primary mobile application, which is currently implemented in both Kotlin (Android) and Swift (iOS). Another is to optimize the team size (and therefore cost) required to build and maintain mobile applications. Finally, we aim to achieve "resource fungibility," an awkward term that we will dive into further later.</p><p>As for my <strong>bias</strong>, I am a web developer with over a decade of both full stack and web development experience, more recently focused on React for about 5 years and almost no professional native development experience. I began this evaluation with a considerable bias toward React Native, given my comfort and experience with React. That said, I still remember when <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/sunsetting-react-native-1868ba28e30a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airbnb sunsetted React Native</a> and a few other industry stories about React Native, so I am aware that organizations have experienced mixed results. I also have some personal skepticism with Google's ability to properly build and maintain a solid open source development framework and keep it alive for the duration I need it (hint: I did some Angular.js development and am <em>not</em> a fan of the latest version of Angular).</p><div><h3>Check yourself</h3><p>Keep your evaluation as objective as possible by paying attention to your bias and the bias of others.</p></div><p>Okay, enough about my context and my bias. Be sure to spend a few minutes writing down these points for yourself. The best way to keep your evaluation as objective as possible is to be aware of your biases.</p><h2>Flutter vs. React Native criteria</h2><p>Before we can evaluate Flutter and React Native we need to establish <strong>criteria</strong>, the principles and standards by which we may judge and decide.</p><p>Here is my list of criteria:</p><ul><li>Built-in Capabilities</li><li>Learning Curve</li><li>Resource Fungibility</li><li>Integration Support</li><li>Developer Experience</li><li>Performance</li><li>Community Support</li><li>Future Prospects</li></ul><p>Each criteria also needs a <strong>weight</strong>, a 1 to 5 rating that designates the level of importance for each criterion where 1 is the lowest importance and 5 is the highest.</p><h3>Built-in Capabilities</h3><p><strong>Weight: 5/5</strong></p><p><em><strong>Weight represents importance</strong></em> on a 1-5 scale where 1 is the least important criteria and 5 is the most important. If you are still not quite sure how the weights are being used, you can sneak a peak at the <a href="https://seanconnolly.dev/help-me-decide?s=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">final scores</a>.</p><p>This category covers the amount and quality of capabilities that are built into the framework itself.</p><p>I am ranking this criterion highly for a few reasons.</p><p>First, the more that is built into the framework, the <strong>faster</strong> our team can get started on any project and the less time we need to spend on <strong>maintenance</strong>.</p><p>Second, <strong>decision fatigue</strong> is real in the JavaScript/React community and it's been a real problem for me in my 5 years of React experience. It is good to have some choices, but I prefer to minimize the number of decisions that we need to make to get up and running.</p><p>Third, missing capabilities often require us to reach for a community solution. We do this all the time in web development, and it comes with significant risk as <strong>many community solutions do not stand the test of time</strong>. Even with well-maintained packages, there is <strong>significant overhead</strong> to staying on top of those ever-evolving dependencies (said Dependabot maintainers everywhere). Last, the more that is built into the framework, the more consistent applications are both within an organization and in the ecosystem itself. Consistency within an organization is beneficial for many reasons, and it is notoriously difficult when many teams are simultaneously solving their own problems and not necessarily checking in to see if others have already solved similar problems. Consistency across the ecosystem is beneficial too. Almost every tutorial or Stack Overflow question dealing with React has <em>something</em> that is inconsistent with the stack I am working in, whether it's using inline styles where we use Emotion, or they are using React Router where I am using the Next.js router, and so on.</p><p>Last, built-in capabilities lower the barrier to getting started with a proof of concept (POC). POCs need to be expendable so you want to minimize any up front investment. A framework with more built-in capabilities will accelerate your ability to go from nothing to a working POC in short time.</p><p>When it comes to built-in capabilities, I broke this up into 3 categories: components, navigation, and testing.</p><h4>Components</h4><p>Flutter provides a full <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Widget catalog</a> that includes the basic building blocks like text, buttons, containers, drawers, inputs, etc. This widget catalog also has built-in support for animation and motion, painting effects and layouts.</p><p>React Native provides a much smaller set of very basic built-in components. Looking for a community solution, I searched for something equivalent to <a href="https://material-ui.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Material-UI</a>, which I have used in many web applications, but had a difficult time finding something even close to the comprehensive suite of components you get with Material UI. I found <a href="https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">react-native-paper</a> and <a href="https://reactnativeelements.com/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">react-native-elements</a> and found them a bit underwhelming in both volume of components and customization flexibility. There may be better component libraries out there, but the fact that you need to find one in the community or create your own is a problem.</p><p>As a web developer, I have worked with many component libraries like Bootstrap, Semantic UI, Material UI, and fully custom design systems and I can say with certainty that I am fatigued from the industry thrashing and fragmentation in this category. Components are such a core part of frontend development that variance just in the component library you choose leads to variance in the entire application. And if you happen to choose a library that falls into obsolescence (looking at you, Semantic UI), you either carry the weight of abandonware or are forced to rewrite. While I don't think it is <em>difficult</em> to write custom components, it <strong>takes time</strong> that my stakeholders would rather be spent on building a product and iterating in market with real users.</p><h4>Navigation</h4><p>With React Native, you must choose between <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/navigation#react-navigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React Navigation</a> or <a href="https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React Native Navigation</a> (and there are even other options out there). As of this writing, React Navigation seems to be the more popular choice, but the choice depends on your needs. If you need a native implementation, you may need to consider React Native Navigation.</p><p>As with widgets, Flutter comes with <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/navigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built-in Navigation utilities</a> along with documented recipes demonstrating the most common use cases.</p><p>Navigation is such a fundamental need in any application, it is somewhat disappointing to me that React Native does not have a strong built-in solution. This is sort of the approach that React has generally taken for a long time where it is a powerful view layer, but everything else needs to be implemented by you or the community.</p><h4>Testing</h4><p>Flutter's SDK has an official <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/flutter_test-library.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flutter_test library</a> that allows you to implement <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/testing/unit/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unit tests</a> and <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/testing/widget/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widget tests</a>. The <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_driver/flutter_driver-library.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flutter_driver library</a>, also shipped with the Flutter SDK, further allows you to implement full integration tests.</p><p>React Native's default template ships with <a href="https://jestjs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jest</a> and is often paired with <a href="https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React Native Testing Library</a>. As a React web developer, I am both familiar and pleased with Jest and the <code>@testing-library</code> suite. For end-to-end testing, there is a bit more variance as the React Native docs list <a href="https://github.com/wix/detox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Detox</a> and <a href="http://appium.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Appium</a> as viable options but provide little guidance on how to use them.</p><div><h3>Built-in Capabilities Scores</h3><p><strong>Justification:</strong> Flutter has a more complete core, reducing the need for our team to fill in the gaps with our own solutions or solutions from the community.</p></div><h3>Learning Curve</h3><p><strong>Weight: 2/5</strong></p><p>The learning curve of a new technology involves the upfront investment required for a developer to achieve a desirable level of productivity.</p><p>When it comes to learning curve, there are a few key questions to ask:</p><ul><li>How much time will it take to <strong>onboard the current team</strong>, i.e. …</li></ul></div></div>

that provides a unique view of your files by removing the
hierarchy constraints typically imposed on files and folders. In other words, it allows you to think about your
files not as objects <em>stored</em> in folders, but as objects that can be <em>filtered</em> by folders.</p>
<p>Below, the file path <code><span>/A/B/C</span></code> yields the <a href="https://amoffat.github.io/supertag/glossary.html#term-intersection"><span>intersection</span></a> of all of the files that have been tagged with the
tags <code><span>A</span></code>, <code><span>B</span></code>, and <code><span>C</span></code>. Notice that the resulting files do not live <em>inside</em> of the full path,
they simply appear there because they’ve been tagged with each part of the file path.
Supertag takes care of rendering a dynamic directory
structure through which you can filter and navigate these files.</p>
<p><img alt="Supertag file intersection" src="https://amoffat.github.io/supertag/_images/intersection-opt.gif"></p><div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>You <code><span>/A/B/C</span></code> yields the same file intersection as <code><span>/C/B/A</span></code>, <code><span>/B/C/A</span></code>, etc. It doesn’t matter what
order that the path tags are in, because we’re simply dealing with the intersection of the tags.</p>

These people are losing their bank accounts now and we need a solution,’ VVD parliamentarian Helma Lodders told the paper.</p><p>The banks are threatening to close the accounts of people with American nationality, unless they can furnish them with a US tax number. But there are thousands of Dutch nationals in the <a href="https://accidentalamericans.nl/">Netherlands with American nationality</a> who do not have a tax number because they have never lived in the country and may not even have realised they are also American.</p><p>The legislation, known as FATCA – Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act – requires all US citizens to supply the government with information about any assets they hold abroad, including bank accounts, houses and more. It also requires non-US banks with American clients to furnish the IRS with information about those holdings.</p><p>In the Netherlands some 20,000 people are thought to fall into the accidental American category.</p><p>A spokesman for the Dutch banking association said that people caught in the FATCA trap have had several years to sort out their individual situations. ‘Many Dutch banks which do business in the US cannot ignore their rules,’ the spokesman told the NRC.</p><p><strong>Europe</strong></p><p>Hoekstra told MPs ahead of Tuesday evening’s debate that the banks have agreed not to close the accounts of people who have started dealing with the red tape. In addition, the EU is preparing a letter to the US authorities calling for talks on the issue at an EU level, he said.</p><p>Earlier this year, DutchNews.nl reported that <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2020/04/accidental-americans-hit-by-us-consulate-corona-closure/">consulate closures</a> were causing long delays for people who were trying to sort out their paperwork.</p><p>The only other way open to Dutch Americans is to renounce their American nationality. This, however, comes at a prohibitive cost to many– the fee went up from $450 to $2,350 in 2014. They also have to prove they have paid US taxes for the past five years.</p><div onclick="window.location.href='https://www.dutchnews.nl/donate-to-dutchnews-nl/'"><div><h4>Thank you for donating to DutchNews.nl</h4><p>The DutchNews.nl team would like to thank all the generous readers who have made a donation in recent weeks.

      <div><p>«Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita</p><p>mi ritrovai per una selva oscura,</p><p>ché la diritta via era smarrita.»</p><p>«Midway upon the journey of our life</p><p>I found myself within a forest dark,</p><p>For the straightforward pathway had been lost.»</p></div><p>-&nbsp;<span>Dante Alighieri</span></p><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-831a4fb5-7fff-d639-36d7-57d1a4f7bed9"><p><span>I've rediscovered some long forgotten joys since I signed up for SpaceHey yesterday, and even if my mind and thoughts are undoubtedly clouded by nostalgia and a longing for simpler times, certain ideas sprang up in my mind, and I think there is truth to them. I'd like to share these with you, hoping that together we can plant even more new seeds and promote healthier growth in our online communities.</span></p><p><span>One of the biggest takeaways is the difference when compared to the passive consumption on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram (or basically any other social network out there at the moment). Here I am not presented with an infinite amount of content for me to scroll through, I actively have to seek it out. In doing that my relationship with the network and the content available throughout it changes from a <i>reactive</i> one to a <i>proactive</i> one. It becomes an experience more similar to browsing wikipedia for example, guided by curiosity and a genuine sense of exploration. I haven't been able to find the right words so far to explain it in writing, but experiencing it first-hand is a visceral feeling where the contrast between the two approaches is instantly felt, one feels empty and passive, the other engaging and exciting.</span></p><p><span>Adding the like button may have boosted engagement, MAUs (Monthly Active Users), profits and so much else. Algorithms that choose what content to show us did the same. Having tried SpaceHey which lacks these features, what's painfully obvious is that we didn't ask for them, they (and others) were imposed on us to promote the growth of these platforms while disregarding our real needs. They may have boosted some internal metrics and to some extent were justified as a "nice" thing for users, but because of their "success", these "features" were doubled-down on, optimized further and eventually led us to the AI-driven, mostly passive-consumerism, infinity pools that social networks are today.</span></p><p><span>Likewise, standardization (across the board) led to successes, many principally of business value, for the big companies dominating the space. It inevitably led to a loss of individuality however, a digital communism if you will. Users were forced to express themselves in pre-approved formats, that gradually got more and more standardized and limited to the point where today you can't even make the text in your Facebook posts bold (you can choose from a predefined set of stickers though!). To what end has it been? Moderation is as hot of a topic as it ever was, with no definitive solution in sight, in the meantime we jump on every new app that let us express ourselves more, only to fall victim to the all powerful algorithms that ultimately decide which content actually reaches people.</span></p><p><span>There's been a trend in the last few years of longing for the "old internet", places like Yahoo! GeoCities, personal blogs and yes, Myspace profiles, where individuals, rather than big organized groups, were the producers of content. Places where somebody with minimal technical knowledge could put pencil to paper and create something unique that reflected who they were, and where others were actually inclined to discover their creations. Nowadays everything is (or isn't) found through an algorithm (whether the almighty Google Search or a social network's own ranking algorithm) and the services that allowed this kind of content to be created in the first place have either shut down or followed the money and moved on.</span></p><p><span>SpaceHey seems to bring back what made those original services special, introducing both an instrument through which pages can be created and a vibrant platform that allows their discovery. My </span><span><a href="https://spacehey.com/alex">SpaceHey profile</a> requires almost no scrolling, yet I get to convey my own message to you, in the format that I choose. There is an incredible sense of empowerment and liberty in this approach. I can see this as a place where I can connect with people, a starting point when it comes to connecting with the world at large, a place I can call home knowing full well that I will have to leave in order to explore, since after all, there is no endless wall to scroll through.</span></p><p><span>A massive <b>thank you</b> to </span><span><a href="https://spacehey.com/an">An</a> who, by bringing us back to simpler roots showed in such a powerful way how far we have strayed. Wow, can you feel how fresh the air is here! I wish you all the best on this adventure, luck in facing the obstacles that you'll encounter and on filling up those "coming soon" pages (let me know if you need help!).</span></p><p><span>I don't know how long it'll last, but in a way, it doesn't matter.</span></p></span></p>

    <p>Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed about your future? Or perhaps you’re suffering from chronic anxiety and stress and aren’t sure how to better manage your emotions? If that’s the case, you’ve landed on the right page!</p>

<p>After all, modern life can be stressful and quite frankly overwhelming sometimes. Being constantly connected, trying to multitask, and striving for better on a daily basis can be draining and affect our mental well-being.</p>
<p>In that context, journaling can be a powerful way to relieve some of this anxiety and stress and help us thrive. As a testament to this, some of the greatest minds of this world, such as Albert Einstein or Thomas Edison, have spent hours journaling, keeping track of their knowledge, achievements, dreams, and goals.</p>
<p>Do you want to know how journaling can help you be more productive, happier, or more relaxed?</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll explain what journaling is before highlighting the key benefits of keeping a journal. We’ll also deep-dive into some of the best journaling techniques before explaining how to start journaling. All you need to do is sit back, relax and enjoy the read ;)</p>
<h2>What is journaling?</h2>
<p>Journaling is the practice of writing your thoughts, emotions, or goals in a journal or diary on a regular basis. It’s also a way to connect with yourself, express your emotions, track your everyday life, your feelings, your dreams, your fears, and experiences. This self-care technique has been <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/jun02/writing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">shown</a> to help strengthen mental well-being and boost the immune system and has therefore enjoyed increased popularity over the last decade.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Journaling</h2>
<h3>Help Manage Your Stress</h3>
<p>Journaling can be a powerful therapeutic outlet to help relieve stress. Indeed, by expressing yourself on paper, writing down your fears, worries, and even recording negative experiences you’re facing at work or in your personal life, journaling can be cathartic. It can provide a safe and private space where you can freely express negative thoughts or repressed emotions you don’t feel you can share with anyone, allowing for emotional cleansing.
As a result, writing about stressful experiences can be an effective stress management tool that can help reduce stress and its impact on your emotional and physical health.</p>
<h3>Boost Your Memory</h3>
<p>A study published by the <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/xge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Journal of Experimental Psychology</a> revealed that writing is an excellent way to boost your working memory. Indeed, the same way athletes need to train to stay in good shape, the study showed that your brain needs to keep active and engaged in order to stay sharp. Some of the key factors contributing to the improvement of your working memory when writing regularly include focusing on a single task without distraction, thinking of ways to describe events, and recalling descriptive words.</p>
<h3>Help You Fight Depression</h3>
<p>Journaling can be a great way to help you work through depression, navigate what’s happening in your life, and ultimately heal.</p>
<p>The reality is, the more you know about your depression, the better you can manage it. By helping you track your triggers and identify regular thoughts, patterns, and behaviors, journaling can help you better understand where your sadness comes from and define a plan to control it better.</p>
<p>Journaling also gives you an opportunity for some positive self-talk and acts as a reminder of your biggest achievements and your best memories.</p>
<p>By identifying your happiest moments and helping control your emotional triggers, writing can help also improve your mood.</p>
<h3>Help You Achieve Your Goals</h3>
<p>A journal is an excellent goal tracking tool. Indeed, by writing down clearly defined goals and recording the steps you’re taking in order to achieve them, a journal can help you fulfill your wildest dreams and aspirations. As a testament to this, a study led by the Dominican University in California even found that people are 42% more likely to reach their goals if they write them down. The reason is simple; writing down your goals can help declutter your mind, give you clarity, and help you create a vision for your future, ensuring your daily habits align with your priorities.</p>
<h3>Enhance Your Creativity</h3>
<p>Creative journaling is a very efficient way to boost your creativity. Your journal is your secret garden. Indeed, no one else has access to it, and nobody else will ever see or read what is in your journal. This helps relieve any kind of societal pressure and paves the way for your imagination to grow and your incredible ideas to flow unhampered.
Besides, not only can you write down your wildest dreams in a journal without fear of being judged, but you can also use your journal as a way to relax and free your mind from the daily draining clutter and noise, allowing your best ideas to mature and come to fruition.</p>
<h2>Best Journaling Techniques</h2>
<h3>Bullet Journaling</h3>
<p>A bullet journal can be used as an organization tool to keep track of your goals, daily achievements, write your to-do lists, or brainstorm ideas. It can also be used as a reminder tool. A bullet journal provides you with a one-stop-shop for all your ideas and allows you to plan, organize, and track your entire life in one consolidated place. The great thing about a bullet journal is that it can be adjusted at any time to fit your needs.</p>
<p>If you like structure and keep organized by listing things, a bullet journal might be a great tool for you.</p>
<p><strong>How to use a bullet journal?</strong>
You can either buy a pre-made bullet journal or create your own. Based on Caroll’s method, your bullet journal should feature an index, along with future, monthly, and daily logs allowing you to plan and track tasks, meetings, appointments or events, and add reminders. The tasks should be represented by a dot bullet, events by a circle bullet, and notes by a dash bullet. Priority tasks should also be highlighted using an asterisk, and completed tasks will be represented by an x. This way, you’ll get a birds-eye view of all the things you need to do this month and be able to adjust as you go.</p>
<h3>Freewriting</h3>
<p>Freewriting is a journaling technique that allows you to write about anything, for a set period of time without having to worry about grammar or self-editing. It was popularized by <a href="https://nataliegoldberg.com/books/writing-down-the-bones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Nathalie Goldberg</a> and encourages writers to take a leap of faith, freely write their thoughts, emotions, and let their creative juices flow. This technique is a powerful way to help content creators and academics boost their creativity while brainstorming ideas.</p>
<p><strong>How to freewrite?</strong>
The most important thing to do when you freewrite is to forget about language rules. Clear your mind, set a timer (ideally between 10 and 20 minutes), and write. Keep writing without ever stopping regardless of the grammatical mistakes or typos until the time limit is over. It’s important to write even if you think it’s stupid or useless, as this is the only way to unleash your creativity with this journaling technique. From this disorganized, seemingly meaningless writing, something powerful will emerge that you can use in your academic or official writings, even if it takes a few freewriting sessions.</p>
<h3>Art Journaling</h3>
<p>If you want to explore fun ways to express yourself, your thoughts, or your emotions, an art journal might be a fantastic tool for you! Whether you use drawings, paintings, sketches, doodles, collages, or a mix of these and writing, keeping an art journal can be an efficient way to help you channel your emotions. It can also help you express your dreams, relax, plan, and organize your life, boost your creativity, or reduce your stress.</p>
<p><strong>How to use an art journal?</strong>
With art journaling, there aren’t any specific rules. The idea is for you to have fun with it. Gather supplies such as paint, gel pens, scissors, markers, and old magazines and start creating ;)</p>
<h3>Unsent Letters</h3>
<p>If you need to process your feelings regarding a particular person, the unsent letter journaling technique could prove helpful. The idea is to put your emotions into words on a piece of paper, from anger and frustration to admiration or love. Sometimes writing down your feelings towards someone addressing them directly in your writing can help you navigate and channel your emotions and process them. As a result, this widely used technique can help you get closure, collect your thoughts, release repressed emotions, and even give you more clarity about specific feelings.</p>
<p><strong>How to write unsent letters?</strong>
When writing an unsent letter, make sure you’re completely honest and genuine and don’t repress from writing down your true feelings. Make sure you freely express your anger, frustration, sadness, or disappointment. Nobody will ever receive or read this letter, so unleash all of your thoughts. Also, unsent letters can be written to anyone or anything, so there is no limit as to who or what you can write a letter to. You can also start your letter with a prompt such as ‘’ What I need to tell you is’’ or ‘’What I don’t like about you is’’ to help you get started.</p>
<p>There are many other powerful journaling techniques, such as dream journaling, writing a reflective journal, or morning pages.</p>
<h2>How to Start Journaling</h2>
<p>Your journaling process should be unique to you. Don’t try and create a perfectly organized journal, instead strive for genuine self-expression and authenticity. To help you get started, we’ve listed below a few tips to follow:</p>
<div>
    <h3>Pick your journaling tool</h3>
    <p>It can be a notebook, a password-protected WordPress website, or an app. Some of the best journaling apps include Day One, Journey, and Grid Diary. Note that, while journaling apps all have different features, strengths, and weaknesses, Day One is regularly touted as the best journal app.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Write a little every day</h3>
    <p>Pick a time of the day where you can allocate ten or fifteen minutes to writing and make it a habit. Consistency is key if you want to make the most out of your journaling practice.</p>

    <h3>Start with short entries</h3>

<div><p>📘 Check the <strong>step-by-step tutorial</strong> on how to easily set up or extend an OpenNebula environment with Kubernetes clusters on the Edge, by visiting the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/en-us/articles/360041948632-How-to-Use-miniONE-to-Deploy-Kubernetes-Clusters-on-the-Edge" target="_blank">OpenNebula Customer Portal</a> <strong>Knowledge Base</strong>.</p></div>



<div><div>
<p>A couple of weeks ago we <a href="https://opennebula.io/opennebula-joins-cncf/">announced</a> that OpenNebula had joined the <strong>Cloud Native Computing Foundation </strong>(CNCF) as a Silver Member. Now we are delighted to confirm that our <strong>Kubernetes Virtual Appliance</strong> for KVM has passed all the tests to be included into the CNCF Landscape as a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://landscape.cncf.io/format=card-mode&amp;selected=open-nebula-kubernetes-appliance" target="_blank">Certified Kubernetes installer</a>!</p>
</div></div>
</div></div></div>



<p>Our virtual appliance gives you <strong>a “press-of-a-button”, simple tool</strong> for creating and deploying a functional container orchestration platform based on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Kubernetes</a>. Our appliance supports <strong>multiple contextualization parameters</strong> to bend to your needs and to your configuration requirements. This works in very much the same spirit as all the other ready-to-use virtual appliances for OpenNebula clouds available at our <a href="https://marketplace.opennebula.io/appliance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Marketplace</a>.</p>

<p>As part of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/" target="_blank">Certified Kubernetes Conformance Program</a>,&nbsp;vendors are invited to submit conformance testing results for <strong>review and certification by the CNCF</strong>, which formally certifies conformant implementations. Most of the world’s leading enterprise software vendors and cloud computing providers have Certified Kubernetes offerings. This program gives end users the confidence that when they use a Certified Kubernetes product they can rely on a <strong>high level of common functionality</strong>. It gives Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) confidence that if their customer is using a Certified Kubernetes platform their software will behave as expected.</p>

<p>Tutanota will Beschwerde gegen den Beschluss einlegen, diese hat jedoch keine aufschiebende Wirkung. â€žWir mussten daher bereits mit der Entwicklung der Ãœberwachungsfunktion beginnenâ€œ, erklÃ¤rte eine Sprecherin Mitte November gegenÃ¼ber câ€™t. Sollte die Beschwerde Erfolg haben, werde man die Funktion nicht aktivieren beziehungsweise wieder entfernen.</p>
<h3 id="nav_abweichende__0">Abweichende Rechtssprechung</h3>
<p>Das KÃ¶lner Urteil ist bemerkenswert, weil es von der Rechtsprechung anderer Gerichte abweicht. So hatte im Sommer <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Mailanbieter-Tutanota-Staatsanwaltschaft-wollte-Chef-in-Beugehaft-nehmen-4908806.html">das Landgericht Hannover entschieden</a>, dass Tutanota im rechtlichen Sinn keine â€žTelekommunikationsdiensteâ€œ erbringt oder daran mitwirkt â€“ und deshalb auch nicht zur TelekommunikationsÃ¼berwachung verpflichtet werden kann. Die hannoverschen Richter verwiesen wiederum auf ein Grundsatzurteil des EuropÃ¤ischen Gerichtshof (EuGH) von 2019. Diesem zufolge sind E-Mail-Dienste keine Kommunikationsdienste.</p>
  <a-script name="132" needs-consent="" src="https://a.teads.tv/page/87298/tag"></a-script>
  

<p>Das KÃ¶lner Gericht sieht Tutanota dennoch als â€žMitwirkendenâ€œ bei der Erbringung von Telekommunikationsdiensten. Folglich mÃ¼sse das Unternehmen die Ãœberwachung ermÃ¶glichen. Das Urteil, das câ€™t vorliegt, nennt allerdings weder den Namen noch den Betreiber des Telekommunikationsdienstes, an dem Tutanota angeblich mitwirkt. Aus Sicht des Unternehmens ist das Urteil deshalb â€žabsurdâ€œ.</p>

<p>In dem Fall geht es um eine Erpressungsmail, die von einem Tutanota-Postfach aus an einen Autozulieferer gesendet worden war. Tutanota sieht sich nun gezwungen, bis Jahresende eine Funktion zu programmieren, die es dem Landeskriminalamt Nordrhein-Westfalen ermÃ¶glicht, dieses Postfach zu Ã¼berwachen.</p>

<p>FÃ¼r die anderen Nutzer soll sich dadurch nichts Ã¤ndern, ihre Mails sollen weiter standardmÃ¤ÃŸig verschlÃ¼sselt werden. Gleichwohl sieht Tutanota eine einmalige Umgehung der VerschlÃ¼sselung als Datenschutz- und Sicherheitsrisiko fÃ¼r letztlich alle Kunden an.</p>
<p><strong>[Update, 30.11., 12 Uhr]</strong> Wie Tutanota betonte, betrifft die ÃœberwachungsmaÃŸnahme nur die neu eingehenden unverschlÃ¼sselten E-Mails. Bereits verschlÃ¼sselte Daten sowie Ende-zu-Ende verschlÃ¼sselte E-Mails in Tutanota kann das Unternehmen nicht entschlÃ¼sseln.<strong> [Update]</strong></p>
<p>AuÃŸer Tutanota speichern auch einige andere Anbieter alle eingehenden Mails in verschlÃ¼sselter Form. Bei Protonmail ist das ebenfalls Standard, Posteo und Mailbox.org bieten die VerschlÃ¼sselung als Option an.

<p>[Edit April 25 2019: Please note <strong>this is not an iPhone or Android app</strong>, and I have no plans to release it as such. You can use your phone or any other camera to take pictures of your ground coffee, but then you need to install the application on either OS X or through Python (on any operating system) to analyze the data. <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/archive/master.zip">Download the application package here</a>.]</p>



<p>Today I would like to present an OS X application I have been developing for a few months. It turns out writing Python software for coffee is a great way to relax after a day of writing Python software for astrophysics.</p>



<p>When I started being interested in brewing specialty coffee a few years ago, one of the first things that irritated me was our inability to recommend grind sizes for different coffee brewing methods, or to compare the quality of different grinders in an objective way. Sure, some laboratories have laser diffraction equipment that can measure the size of all particles coming out of a grinder, but rare are the coffee geeks that have access to these multi-hundred thousands of dollars kinds of equipment.</p>



<p>At first, I decided to take pictures of my coffee grounds spread on a white sheet, and to use an old piece of software called <a href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">ImageJ</a>, developed by the National Institutes of Health mainly to analyze microscope images, to obtain a distribution of the sizes of my coffee grounds. This worked decently well, and allowed me to start comparing different grinders. Then <a href="https://www.scottrao.com/">Scott Rao</a> made me realize that a stand-alone application that doesn’t need a complicated installation and that is dedicated to coffee would be of interest to many people in the coffee industry. Probably just the 10% geekiest of them, but that’s cool.</p>



<p>I’m hoping that this application will help us understand the effects of particle size distributions on the taste of coffee. I don’t think the industry really kept us in the loop with all the laser diffraction experiments, so hopefully we can help ourselves as a community.</p>



<p>If you are interested in measuring the particle size distribution of your grinder, then this app is for you ‒ and it’s free. I placed it as “open source” on <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize">GitHub</a>, so if you are a developer, you are welcome to send me suggestions in the form of <em>push requests</em> (the developers will know what that means).</p>



<p>If you would like to get started, I suggest you read this quick <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_installation.pdf">installation guide</a>, which will explain how to download the app and run it even though I am not a registered Apple Developer. Then, you can choose to either read this <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_summarized_manual.pdf">quick summary</a> that will get you running with the basics, or this <strong><em>very</em></strong> detailed and wordy <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_manual.pdf">user manual</a> that will guide you through all the detailed options the application offers you.</p>



<p>I would like to show you an example of what can be done with the software. Below, I am comparing the particle size distribution of the Baratza Forté grinder, which uses 54 mm flat steel burrs, with that of the Lido 3 hand grinder, which uses 48 mm conical steel burrs. I set both grinders in a way that produces a similar peak of average-sized particles with diameters around 1 mm, but as you can see, the particle size distributions are very different ! The Forté generates way less fines (with diameters below 0.5 mm) and slightly less boulders (with diameters of approximately 2 mm), which is indicative of a better quality grinder.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="976" data-permalink="https://coffeeadastra.com/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam/" data-orig-file="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png" data-orig-size="1000,780" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png?w=750" src="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png" alt=""><figcaption>An example of figure that can be generated with the coffee grind size software. Each red bar corresponds to one kind of particle diameter generated by the Lido 3 grinder (smallest particles correspond to the leftmost bar, largest ones correspond to the rightmost bar), and their heights correspond to the total contribution of these kinds of particles, by mass. As you can see, the particles that contribute to the largest amount of mass have sizes just above 1 mm. The red circle shows the average particle diameter for the Lido 3, and the horizontal bars show the “characteristic width” of the distribution – this corresponds to the width that covers approximately 68% of all the distribution. Similarly, the blue line and the blue circle describe the distribution of the Forté grinder.</figcaption></figure>



<p>For now, the app is only intended to be used on OS X computers. But if you are running any other kind of system and know your way around Python, you can always download it directly from <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize">GitHub</a> and run it with your own installation of Python 3.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/66ug5i9bkhrghef/screencap_coffeegrindsize.mov?raw=1"></video><figcaption>This is an example of how to use the coffee grind size application.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I would like to thank Scott Rao for his excitement when I shared this project idea with him, and for beta testing the software. I would also like to thank Alex Levitt, Mitch Hale, Caleb Fischer, Francisco Quijano and Victor Malherbe for beta testing the software.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you do reverse engineering for a living?
Have you ever wasted several weeks reversing an open source library embedded in a target?
Do you crave for better tools than copy-pasting random strings into Google?</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>Well, read anyway.</p>
<p>-- <em>babush</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today we are proud of showing the world the first prototype of <strong>Big Match</strong>, our tool to find open-source libraries in binaries <strong>only using their strings</strong>.
How does it work?
Read this post to find out, or head to <a href="https://bigmatch.rev.ng/"><strong>our demo website</strong></a> to try it out.</p>
<p><a href="https://bigmatch.rev.ng/"><img src="https://rev.ng/blog/big-match/homepage.png"></a></p>
<p><strong>Spoiler:</strong> we are analyzing all the repositories on GitHub and building a search engine on top of that data.</p>

          
          
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There's a thing that every good reverser does when starting to work on a target: look for interesting strings and throw them into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"><strong>Google</strong></a> hoping to find some open-source or leaked source.
This can save you anywhere from few hours of work to several days.
It's kind of a poor man's function (or library) matching.</p>
<p>In 2018, I decided to try out <strong><a href="https://line.me/en/">LINE</a>'s Bug Bounty</strong> program and so I started reversing a library bundled with the Android version of the App.
For those unfamiliar with LINE, it's the most used instant messaging App in Japan.
Anyway, there were many useful error strings sprinkled all around my target, so I did exactly that manual googling I've just mentioned.
Luckily, I was able to match some strings against Cisco's <a href="https://github.com/cisco/libsrtp"><code>libsrtp</code></a>.
But little did I know, my target included a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject"><code>PJSIP</code></a>, a <strong>huge</strong> library that does indeed include <code>libsrtp</code>.
Unfortunately, I discovered this fact much later, so I wasted an entire week reversing an open-source library.</p>
<p>So, I thought: <em>"can we do better than manual googling? Why hasn't anyone built a huge database of all the strings in every public repository?"</em>.
And, just like that, the main idea for <strong>Big Match</strong> was born.</p>
<h2>Outline of our approach</h2>
<p>The way we, at rev.ng, decided to approach this problem is actually simple conceptually, but gets tricky due to the scale of the data we are dealing with.</p>
<p>In short, this is the outline of what we did:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Get the source code of the top C/C++ repositories on GitHub</strong>, where <em>"top"</em> means <em>"most starred"</em>. Ideally we would like to analyze all of them, and we will eventually, but we wanted to give priority to famous projects.</li>
<li>
<strong>Deduplicate the repositories:</strong> we don't want to have 70k+ slightly different versions of the Linux kernel in our database.</li>
<li>
<strong>Extract the strings</strong>: use <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep"><code>ripgrep</code></a> as a quick way to extract strings from source code.</li>
<li>
<strong>De-escape</strong> the strings. E.g.: turn <code>'\n'</code> into an actual newline character.</li>
<li>
<strong>Hash</strong> the strings.</li>
<li>
<strong>Store them</strong> in some kind of database.</li>
<li>
<strong>Query</strong> the database using the hashes of the strings from a target binary.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cluster</strong> the query results.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Where to start</h2>
<p>The first thing we did was figure out a way to <strong>get the list of all the repos on GitHub</strong>, sorted by stars.
It turns out, however, that this is more easily said than done.
GitHub has an official API but it is rate-limited and we wanted to avoid writing a multi-machine crawling system just for that.
So we looked around and, among many projects making available GitHub data, we found the amazing <a href="https://ghtorrent.org/"><strong>GHTorrent</strong></a>.</p>
<p>GHTorrent, short for <em>GitHub Torrent</em>, is a project created by Prof. Georgios Gousios of TU Delft.
What it does is periodically poll GitHub's <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/#list-public-events">public events API</a> and use the information on commits and new repositories to record the history of GitHub.
So, for example, if user <code>thebabush</code> pushes some changes to his repository <code>awesome-repo</code>, GHTorrent analyzes those changes and, if the repo is not present in its database, it creates a new entry.
It also saves its metadata, e.g. star count, and some of its commits.
By exploiting the GitHub REST API, GHTorrent is able to create a somewhat complete <a href="https://ghtorrent.org/relational.html">relational view</a> of all of GitHub (except for the actual source code):</p>
<p><a href="https://rev.ng/blog/big-match/ghtorrent-schema.svg"><img src="https://rev.ng/blog/big-match/ghtorrent-schema.svg"></a></p>
<p>GHTorrent's data is made available as either a MySQL dump of the relational database in the picture or as a series of daily MongoDB dumps.
GHTorrent uses Mongo as a caching layer for GitHub's API so that it can avoid making the same API call twice.</p>
<p>Once you import the GHTorrent MySQL dumps on your machine, you can quickly get useful information about GitHub using good ol' SQL (e.g.: information about the most popular C/C++ repos is a simple <code>SELECT ... WHERE ... ORDER BY ...</code>).
It also contains information about forks and commits, so you have some good data to exploit for the repo deduplication we want to do.</p>
<p>However, <strong>GHTorrent is best-effort by design</strong>, so you'll never have a complete and consistent snapshot of GitHub.
For example, some repos might be missing or have outdated metadata.
Another example is that commits information is partial: GHTorrent cannot possibly associate every commit to every repository containing it.
Think about the Linux kernel: one commit would need to be added to 70k+ forks and that kind of things doesn't scale very well.</p>
<p>Finally, there's another risk regarding the use of a project like GHTorrent: <strong>maintenance</strong>.
Keeping a crawler working costs money and time, and it seems like in the last couple of years <a href="http://ghtorrent-downloads.ewi.tudelft.nl/mysql/">they haven't been releasing MySQL dumps that often anymore</a>.
On the other hand, they still release their <a href="http://ghtorrent-downloads.ewi.tudelft.nl/mongo-daily/">incremental Mongo updates daily</a>.
Since they create the MySQL DB using REST API calls that are cached through MongoDB, those incremental updates should be everything you need to recreate their MySQL database.</p>
<p>A fun fact is that <strong>Microsoft used to sponsor GHTorrent</strong>, but I guess <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/announcement/microsoft-acquires-github/">they don't need to do it now</a> 🙃.
And yes, that's not a good thing for us.</p>
<p>In the end, since we don't actually need all the tables provided by the GHTorrent MySQL dump, we decided to write a script that directly consumes their Mongo dumps one by one and outputs the information we need into a bunch of text files.
In fact, <strong>most of our pipeline is implemented using bash scripts</strong> (you can read more in our future blogpost about what we like to call <strong><em>bashML</em></strong>).</p>
<h2>Repository deduplication</h2>
<p>We mentioned in the outline that we need to deduplicate the repositories.
We need to do that for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>As stated earlier, we don't want to download every single fork of every single famous project out there.</li>
<li>Duplicated data means that our database of repos grows very fast in size. The first ~100K repos we downloaded from GitHub amount to ~1.4TB of <code>gzip</code>'d source code (without <code>git</code> history), so you can see why this is an important point.</li>
<li>Duplicated data is bad for <strong>search results accuracy</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>GHTorrent has information about forks but, as for GitHub itself, that only counts forks created with the <em>"Fork"</em> button on the web UI.
The other option is to look for common commits between repositories.
If we had infinite computing resources, we would do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Clone every repository</strong> we care about.</li>
<li>Put every commit hash in a <strong>graph database</strong> of some kind.</li>
<li>Connect commit hashes using their <strong>parent/child relationship</strong>.</li>
<li>Find the <strong>root commits</strong>.</li>
<li>For every root commit, <strong>keep only the most-starred repo</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, we live in the real world, so this is simply impossible for us to do.
We would like to have a strategy to deduplicate repos <strong>before</strong> cloning them, as cloning would require a lot of time and bandwidth.
On top of that, when using git you can merge the history of totally-unrelated projects.
So, if you deduplicate repos based on the root commit alone, you end up removing a lot of projects you actually want to keep.</p>
<p>Case in point: <strong><a href="https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife"><code>octocat/Spoon-Knife</code></a></strong>.</p>
<h2>Octocat</h2>
<p><code>octocat/Spoon-Knife</code> is the <strong>most forked project</strong> on GitHub, and there's a reason for that: it's the repo that is used in GitHub's <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/">tutorial on forking</a>.
This means that a lot of people learning to use GitHub have forked this repo at some point.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why <code>Spoon-Knife</code> causes troubles to our theoretical deduplication algorithm.
Well, take a look at this screenshot of <code>LibreCAD</code>'s git history:</p>
<p><img alt="LibreCAD history" src="https://rev.ng/blog/big-match/librecad.png"></p>
<p>At some point in the past some user by the name of <code>youarefunny</code> was learning to use GitHub and so he forked <code>Spoon-Knife</code>.
At some other point, he forked <code>LibreCAD</code> and made some commits.
Then, for whatever reason, he thought <em>"well, why not merge the history of these two nice repositories in a single one? So we can have a branch with the history of both projects!"</em>.
And finally, just to <del>fuck with us</del> contribute to a useful open-source project like <code>LibreCAD</code>, he decided to open a pull request using that exact branch.
And that pull request was accepted.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> the history of <code>Spoon-Knife</code> is included in <code>LibreCAD</code>'s repo.</p>
<p>If you want to check this out, visit <a href="https://github.com/LibreCAD/LibreCAD/commit/f08a37f282dd30ce7cb759d6cf8981c982290170">this link</a> or clone <code>LibreCAD/LibreCAD</code> and run <code>git diff f08a37f282dd30ce7cb759d6cf8981c982290170</code>.</p>
<p>Things like this present a serious issue for us because <code>Spoon-Knife</code> has 10.3k stars at the moment, while <code>LibreCAD</code> only has 2k.
Which means that if we were to remove the least starred project, we would actually remove <code>LibreCAD</code> and keep the utterly useless <code>Spoon-Knife</code> repo.</p>
<p>I hate you <code>yourefunny</code>.
And no, you are not actually funny.</p>
<p>But <code>yourefunny</code> is not alone in this: during our tests we've found that some people also like to merge the history of Linux and LLVM.
Go figure.</p>
<h2>Best-effort deduplication</h2>
<p>So we can't <code>git clone</code> every repo on GitHub and we can't do root-based deduplication.
What we can do is use GHTorrent once again and implement a different strategy.
In fact, <strong>GHTorrent has information about commits</strong>, too, albeit limited.
This is what it gives us:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<em>(partial)</em> <code>(parent commit, child commit)</code> relations.</li>
<li>
<em>(partial)</em> <code>(commit, repository)</code> relations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Exploiting this data we can't reconstruct the full git history of every repository, but we can recreate <strong>subgraphs</strong> of it.
We then apply this algorithm:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find a commit for which GHTorrent doesn't have a parent (we call them <em>parentless commits</em>) and consider it a root commit.</li>
<li>Explore the commit history graph starting at a root commit. We do this going <strong>upward</strong>, that is, only following <code>parent → child</code> edges.</li>
<li>We group all the repositories associated with the commits of a subgraph we obtain in step 2. We call such group a <em>repository group</em>.</li>
<li>For every repository group, we find the most starred repo it contains and consider it the <em>parent repo</em>, …</li></ol></div></div>

  </p>


<p>x86 is back in the general programmer discourse, in part thanks to Apple’s M1 and
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/about_the_rosetta_translation_environment">Rosetta 2</a>.
As such, I figured I’d do <em>yet another</em> x86-64 post.</p>

<p>Just like <a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/2020/06/13/How-x86_64-addresses-memory">the last one</a>,
I’m going to cover a facet of the x86-64 ISA that sets it apart
as unusually complex among modern ISAs: the number and diversity of registers available.</p>

<p><a href="https://stefanheule.com/blog/how-many-x86-64-instructions-are-there-anyway/">Like instruction counting</a>,
register counting on x86-64 is subject to debates over methodology. In particular, for this blog
post, I’m going to lay the following ground rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>will</strong> count sub-registers (e.g., <code>EAX</code> for <code>RAX</code>) as distinct registers. My justification:
they have different instruction encodings, and both Intel and AMD optimize/pessimize
particular sub-register use patterns in their microcode.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>will</strong> count registers that are present on x86-64 CPUs, but that can’t be used in long mode.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>won’t</strong> count registers that are <em>only</em> present on older x86 CPUs, like the 80386 and
80486 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_register">test registers</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>won’t</strong> count microarchitectural implementation details, like shadow registers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>will</strong> count registers that aren’t directly addressable, like MSRs that can only be accessed
through <code>RDMSR</code>. However, I <strong>won’t</strong> (or will try not to) double-count registers that
have multiple access mechanisms (like <code>RDMSR</code> and <code>RDTSC</code>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>won’t</strong> count model-specific registers that fall into these categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>MSRs that are only present on niche x86 vendors (Cyrix, Via)</li>
      <li>MSRs that aren’t widely available on recent-ish x86-64 CPUs
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Errata</strong>: I accidentally included AVX-512 in some of the original counts below,
  not realizing that it hadn’t been released on any AMD CPUs. The post has been updated.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>MSRs that are <em>completely</em> undocumented (both officially and unofficially)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the rules above, I’m going to use the following considerations and methodology
for grouping registers together:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many sources, both official and unofficial, use “model-specific register” as an umbrella term
for any non-core or non-feature-set register supplied by an x86-64 CPU. Whenever possible, I’ll
try to avoid this in favor of more specific categories.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both Intel and AMD provide synonyms for registers (e.g. <code>CR8</code> as the “task priority register,” or
<code>TPR</code>). Whenever possible, I’ll try to use the more generic/category conforming name (like <code>CR8</code>
in the case above).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general, the individual cores of a multicore processor have independent register states.
Whenever this <strong>isn’t</strong> the case, I’ll make an effort to document it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="general-purpose-registers">General-purpose registers</h2>

<p>The general-purpose registers (or GPRs) are <strong>the</strong> primary registers in the x86-64 register model.
As their name implies, they are the <strong>only</strong> registers that are <em>general purpose</em>: each has a set
of conventional uses<sup id="fnref:conventional" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:conventional">1</a></sup>, but programmers are generally free to ignore those conventions and use
them as they please<sup id="fnref:ignore" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ignore">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Because x86-64 evolved from a 32-bit ISA which in turn evolved from a 16-bit ISA, each
GPR has a set of <em>subregisters</em> that hold the lower 8, 16 and 32 bits of the full 64-bit
register.</p>

<p>As a table:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    
    <th>64-bit</th>

  <tr>
    
    <td>R15</td>
    
    <td>R15D</td>
    
    <td>R15W</td>
    
    <td>R15B</td>
    
  </tr>
  
</tbody></table>

<p>Some of the 16-bit subregisters are also special: the original 8086 allowed the <strong>high</strong> byte
of <code>AX</code>, <code>BX</code>, <code>CX</code>, and <code>DX</code> to be accessed indepenently, so x86-64 preserves this for some
encodings:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    
    <th>16-bit</th>
    
    <th>8-bit (high)</th>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>AX</td>
    
    <td> AH</td>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>BX</td>
    
    <td> BH</td>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>CX</td>
    
    <td> CH</td>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>DX</td>
    
    <td> DH</td>
    
  </tr>
  
</tbody></table>

<p>So that’s 16 full-width GPRs, fanning out to another 52 subregisters.</p>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 68</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Running total: 68</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="special-registers">Special registers</h2>

<p>This is sort of an artificial category: like every ISA, x86-64 has a few “special” registers that
keep things moving along. In particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <em>instruction pointer</em>, or <code>RIP</code>.</p>

    <p>x86-64 has 32- and 16-bit variants of <code>RIP</code> (<code>EIP</code> and <code>IP</code>), but I’m <strong>not</strong> going to count
  them as separate registers: they have identical encodings and can’t be used in the same
  CPU mode<sup id="fnref:ip" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ip">3</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <em>status register</em>, or <code>RFLAGS</code>.</p>

    <p>Just like <code>RIP</code>, <code>RFLAGS</code> has 32- and 16-bit counterparts (<code>EFLAGS</code> and <code>FLAGS</code>). Unlike
  <code>RIP</code>, these counterparts can be partially mixed: <code>PUSHF</code> and <code>PUSHFQ</code> are both valid in
  long mode, and <code>LAHF</code>/<code>SAHF</code> can operate on the bits of <code>FLAGS</code> on some x86-64 CPUs
  outside of compatiblility mode<sup id="fnref:cpuid-lahf-sahf" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cpuid-lahf-sahf">4</a></sup>. So I’m going to go ahead and count them.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 4</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Running total: 72</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="segment-registers">Segment registers</h2>

<p>x86-64 has a total of 6 segment registers: <code>CS</code>, <code>SS</code>, <code>DS</code>, <code>ES</code>, <code>FS</code>, and <code>GS</code>. The operation
varies with the CPU’s mode:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In all modes except for long mode, each segment register holds a <em>selector</em>, which indexes into
either the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Descriptor_Table">GDT</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Descriptor_Table#Local_Descriptor_Table">LDT</a>. That yields
a segment <em>descriptor</em> which, among other things, supplies the base address and extent of the
segment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In long mode all but <code>FS</code> and <code>GS</code> are treated as having a base address of zero and a 64-bit
extent, effectively producing a flat address space. <code>FS</code> and <code>GS</code> are retained as special cases,
but no longer use the segment descriptor tables: instead, they access base addresses that
are stored in the <code>FSBASE</code> and <code>GSBASE</code> model-specific registers<sup id="fnref:kernelgsbase" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:kernelgsbase">5</a></sup>.
More on those later.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 6</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Running total: 78</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="simd-and-fp-registers">SIMD and FP registers</h2>

<p>The x86 family has gone through <em>several</em> generations of SIMD and floating-point instruction
groups, each of which has introduced, extended, or re-contextualized various registers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>x87</li>
  <li>MMX</li>
  <li>SSE (SSE2, SSE3, SSE4, SSE4, …)</li>
  <li>AVX (AVX2, AVX512)</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s do them in rough order.</p>

<h3 id="x87">x87</h3>

<p>Originally a discrete coprocessor with its own instruction set and register file, the x87
instructions have been regularly baked into x86 cores themselves since the 80486.</p>

<p>Because of its coprocessor history, x87 defines both normal registers<sup id="fnref:normal-ish" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:normal-ish">6</a></sup>
(akin to GPRs) and a variety of special registers needed to control the FPU state:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>ST0</code> through <code>ST7</code>: 8 80-bit floating-point registers</li>
  <li><code>FPSW</code>, <code>FPCW</code>, <code>FPTW</code> <sup id="fnref:mynames" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mynames">7</a></sup>: Control, status, and tag-word registers</li>
  <li>“Data operand pointer”: I don’t know what this one does, but the Intel SDM specifies it<sup id="fnref:sdm" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sdm">8</a></sup></li>
  <li>Instruction pointer: the x87 state machine apparently holds its own copy of the current
x87 instruction</li>
  <li>Last instruction opcode: this is apparently distinct from the x87 opcode, and has its
own register</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 14</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Running total: 92</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="mmx">MMX</h3>

<p>MMX was Intel’s first attempt at consumer SIMD in their x86 chips, released back in 1997.</p>

<p>For design reasons that are a complete mystery to me, the MMX registers are actually sub-registers
of the x87 <code>STn</code> registers: each 64-bit <code>MMn</code> occupies the mantissa component of its corresponding
<code>STn</code>. Consequently, x86 (and x86-64) CPUs cannot execute MMX and x87 instructions at the same time.</p>

<p>In addition to <code>MM0</code> through <code>MM7</code>, MMX also defines a new status register (<code>MXCSR</code>) as well as
a load/store instruction pair for manipulating it (<code>LDMXCSR</code> and <code>STMXCSR</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 9</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Running total: 101</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="sse-and-avx">SSE and AVX</h3>

<p>For simplicity’s sake, I’m going to wrap SSE and AVX into a single section: they use the same
sub-register pattern as the GPRs and x87/MMX do, so they fit well into a single table:</p>

<p>In other words: the lower half of each <code>ZMMn</code> is <code>YMMn</code>, and the lower half of each <code>YMMn</code> is
<code>XMMn</code>. There’s no direct way register access for just the upper half of <code>YMMn</code>, nor does
<code>ZMMn</code> have direct 256- or 128-bit access for the thunks of its upper half.</p>

<p>SSE also defines a new status register, <code>MXCSR</code>, that contains flags roughly parallel
to the arithmetic flags in <code>RFLAGS</code> (along with floating-point flags in the x87 status word).</p>

<p>AVX-512 <strong>also</strong> introduces eight <em>opmask</em> registers, <code>k0</code> through <code>k7</code>. <code>k0</code> is a special case
that behaves much like the “zero” register on some RISC ISAs: it can’t be stored to, and
loads from it always produce a bitmask of all ones.</p>

<p><strong>Errata</strong>: The table above includes AVX-512, which isn’t available on any AMD CPUs as of 2020.
I’ve updated the counts below to only include SSE and AVX2-introduced registers.</p>

<h2 id="bounds-registers">Bounds registers</h2>

<p>Intel added these with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_MPX">MPX</a>, which was intended to
offer hardware-accelerated bounds checking. Nobody uses it, since
<a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Intel-MPX-Is-Dead">it doesn’t work very well</a>.
But x86 is eternal and slow to fix mistakes, so we’ll probably have these registers taking up space
for at least a while longer:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>BND0</code> — <code>BND3</code>: Individual 128-bit registers, each containing a pair of addresses
for a bound.</li>
  <li><code>BNDCFG</code>: Bound configuration, kernel mode.</li>
  <li><code>BNDCFU</code>: Bound configuration, user mode.</li>
  <li><code>BNDSTATUS</code>: Bound status, after a <code>#BR</code> is raised.</li>

<h2 id="debug-registers">Debug registers</h2>

<p>These are what they sound like: registers that aid and accelerate software debuggers, like
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/">GDB</a>.</p>

<p>There are 6 debug registers of two types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>DR0</code> through <code>DR3</code> contain linear addresses, each of which is associated with a breakpoint
condition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>DR6</code> and <code>DR7</code> are the debug status and control registers. <code>DR6</code>’s lower bits indicate which
debug conditions were encountered (upon entering the debug exception handler), while <code>DR7</code> controls
which breakpoint addresses are enabled and their breakpoint conditions (e.g., when a particular
address is written to).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What about <code>DR4</code> and <code>DR5</code>? For reasons that are unclear to me, they don’t (and have never)
existed<sup id="fnref:guess" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:guess">9</a></sup>. They <em>do</em> have encodings but are treated as <code>DR6</code> and <code>DR7</code>, respective, or produce
an <code>#UD</code> exception when <code>CR4.DE[bit 3] = 1</code>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<article>
<p>I have no real interests or hobbies. If I was shopping for myself I’d probably just buy another book on “growing your side hustle” or one of the many “building a startup” books.</p>
<p>Revenue, monetization, and profit are always the primary driver for my activities. Whether or not I actually care about a particular topic is sorta irrelevant. And my frustration is that depending on who I talk to, I get entirely different perspectives on whether this going to facilitate my success in life or not. For example, people who are like my business/money focused family applaud my efforts. They don’t understand how this is bad.</p>
<p>“Dave, how is spending your free time trying to make more money a bad thing? You can use that money to pursue your hobbies or interests.”</p>
<p>“Yeah uncle, but I honestly don’t know what my hobbies and interests are besides things that make more money.”</p>
<p>“Great Dave, so your passion is making money!”</p>
<p>“But I don’t want that to be my passion!”</p>
<p>But if I talk to my more passion focused friends, I’m sorta self-judging in my head.</p>
<p>“Dave, I’m working on a youth charity. It’s soo many hours of long work and stressful, but really rewarding.”</p>
<p>“Oh umm…that’s great Pam. But that’s a lot of work, and no money? Like…is it really worth it? Imagine if you turned it into some type of education business. What’s the market like for that? You could charge at least $300 per student.”</p>
<p>Ugh, this is what gives me migraines. My 25 year old anxiety is telling me that if I pick the wrong strategy then my future is forever doomed. I also have no idea where this obsession began. I didn’t grow up poor, so I can’t use that as an excuse for my obsession. I think it might have to do with imposter syndrome and feeling like I have to prove myself. Basically, if I have lots of money rolling in then I can say “fuck the system” and not be criticized. I falsely feel like people can’t judge me if I have my own business that’s making Elon Musk level income.</p>
<p>Or maybe it’s simply because I live in the United States, and that’s just our culture here. Plus with all the uncertainty, you never know when debt can hit you. Poverty, streets, homeless shelter, etc.</p>
<p>But this just all feels wrong to me. It feels like I’m digging myself into a bad hole. What if my time was used toward genuine activities and interests? I could also have a chance at financial success with those. I just don’t know what those genuine interests are. All I know is that when I chase after these money quests, I always feel cheated in the end.</p>
<p>Let’s walk inside my mind for a second.</p>
<p>So I work on coding side projects outside of work. Do I love coding and problem solving? Eh, I’m not really sure. But, I do love the idea of one day rolling in cash from some tool or app I built. Therefore, I’m going to spend my time trying to find a niche market that I can penetrate with some basic app/program that I can at least charge $100 a month for. Then I just need to spend a couple of hours everyday scouring through Google trends, Reddit, or Exploding Topics to find something people are currently into. Then maybe set up a landing page, and see if people enter in their credit card info. Or how about I search the Apple App Store and find some shitty app that people pay big bucks for and copy it? Oh wait, hold up, snack boxes are trending! Okay, so I can just set up a service for $20 a month to send people almonds, right?</p>
<p>Trust me, it gets worst.</p>
<p>I make videos on YouTube. I have a little over 200k subscribers currently. Do I like making videos? Eh…I’m not really sure. Truthfully, most days I would rather not engage in the activity. But influencer sponsorships pay a lot! Also, adsense is a really nice passive income source. So what I need to do is spend my time studying the YouTube algorithm so I can produce videos that get more views. More views equals more money!! Oh and remember when I made videos on Android? Yeah nobody cares about that niche anymore. So I’m going to use tools like TubeBuddy or VidIQ to see trending topics that people are watching. Okay people are all talking about <em>Among Us</em> right now. So if I make a video that’s at least 10 minutes long I can stick a mid-roll ad into it too! Don’t forget all the long-tail keywords. Wait, my website hardly has any ads on it right now. I’m missing out on extra income! I need at least a sidebar ad and also a footer ad.</p>
<p>Guess what? After two days I lost motivation in the Snackbox idea. As for YouTube, I made videos on the “well researched SEO friendly topics” and they performed horribly. It was like another slap in the face saying “Dave, this is what happens when you chase money without regard for interests.” But….but…all the entrepreneurs say just having interest in building a business is enough!</p>
<p>Yeah, so I don’t know what to say or how to end this. I’m just hoping that by sharing my obstacles and fears I get some helpful incite; or at least connect people who also share this struggle. I feel like it’s one of the many problems that’s not addressed adequately and leaves us just desperate for answers.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed the way we operate in the world. One of the most significant changes has been a large shift to remote work. According to a <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-agenda/ceo-panel-survey-emerge-stronger.pdf">survey conducted by PwC</a>, 80% of CEOs expect widespread remote work to continue even after COVID-19 passes.</p><p>With distributed workforces becoming more prevalent, the use of video conferencing technology has skyrocketed. We used our <a href="https://www.datashake.com/review-index-api">Review Index API</a> to analyze the aggregated consumer reviews of Zoom Video Communications and how those reviews relate to the company’s stock performance.</p><blockquote>We include the notebook used for this data analysis at the end of this post, as well as all the raw data for your own analysis.</blockquote><p>Extracting the online review data for this analysis was made easy by our Review Index API, allowing us to extract Zoom's online reviews in just one API call:</p><figure><pre><code>$ curl --request GET --url 'https://app.datashake.com/api/v2/review_index?domain=zoom.us&amp;ticker_symbol=ZM' --header 'spiderman-token: API_KEY'</code></pre><figcaption>Remember to replace API_KEY with your own API key.</figcaption></figure><p>In the background, this API has done the heavy lifting of indexing all of Zoom's review profiles across the Internet, along with their associated reviews.</p><h2 id="diving-into-the-data">Diving into the Data</h2><p><strong>Review Rating</strong></p><p>Although Zoom has exploded in popularity since the pandemic, it has been a favorite among remote workers for years. Zoom is not only a great video conferencing software but a top software company overall. The Software Report, which ranks companies based on industry professional and customer reviews, <a href="https://www.thesoftwarereport.com/the-top-100-software-companies-of-2020/">ranked Zoom 33rd best</a> software company in the world in 2020.</p><p>Compared to its competitors – which include BlueJeans, GoToMeeting, Join.me, Skype, Slack and Webex – Zoom’s consumer reviews are exceptional. Since the beginning of 2019, Zoom’s average review rating has not dropped below a score of 4 (out of 5).</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iTGuYrDaOXUWe_7-zwD7_wvRfN9RUKfa-4l8L5II9Jnevn4nBaktsi5TL1G8Vbb2AhfVJUnsQUbUhEhSp6gx47lTBe_DoBiP_pswrULTac5x2yJxDnCPouo1Of5K4vsnZXM_DQJDzRg82tT2mg" alt=""></figure><p>However, Zoom’s average rating has dropped slightly since COVID-19 started. Before the pandemic, Zoom averaged a review rating of 4.66 and averaged a review rating of 4.55 after the pandemic.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/z9aeFU3rcw06ELomxMX2TE6yArPS40r5ZQ8nMF6DFvxkcMgjXlPF9iEMK-EOWLMRAQaQqR2o7IYcWTr394DT_oFCcl4Up0n2pwkAax01VCz5zIeJUvWEfMQgzxRT6LAX7ZHZEXgpuIyqyFP4gg" alt=""></figure><p><strong>Review Text</strong><br>Zoom’s rating drop can most likely be attributed to a large influx of new users putting more stress on their infrastructure. Our Review Index API also comes with the actual review text for every review across multiple platforms. &nbsp;If we look at reviews with a rating of 3 or worse that mention “quality” in the review text, we can get a good idea of how many consumers were unhappy with Zoom’s quality.</p><p>We can see from the chart below that quality issue reviews spiked from July to August, right around the same time Zoom’s average rating dropped. The review rating and the percentage of quality issue reviews have a correlation coefficient of -0.38. So, when quality issues rise, the average review rating tends to drop.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7NtOKn_xUFg_lnDp3femO58IgmqNPDKiBukZpRzUCYCz1aQIQbuoIL71o3wR0dp_oDYBJdlGv3WoO77lAXfrGlZVHecdfMtJY59BYS5kpg9q_BbpsczVAeT_yrisLUjfuRVf60d37BKjm__N6Q" alt=""></figure><p>After COVID-19 began, Zoom’s average rating dropped by 2.2%, which was the second to worst drop compared to Join.me’s 2.3% drop. Zoom’s quality issues may be something to keep an eye on in the short-term but a well-managed company like Zoom should be able to make the necessary adjustments.</p><p><strong>Review Volume</strong></p><p>When it comes to review volume, Zoom’s advantage over competitors becomes more apparent. Since COVID-19 began, the review volume of Zoom’s competitors has dropped or only slightly risen while Zoom’s review volume has surged.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/GfyE4NBkIYLa6zbPHtSeVrESc5dEbGu9r6KO8mWCS6fBs_JxCbLj_ZZ6H3XrDNPV0mpRuFg_98cgGaB8VBFTWXpad4HeFrqt9nCqcWrnd1EHJR6KJLrN44QqXquRSusg9ht9vfjIcdeANhU3DA" alt=""></figure><p>Before COVID, Zoom and Slack were fairly even at 22 and 20 average daily reviews, respectively. After COVID, Zoom averaged 40 daily reviews and Slack’s average dropped to 12 daily reviews. Zoom’s review volume peaked in early October at a whopping 95 reviews per day.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_BsaLOOWX_gooJMmoH893ndZhdGP9mF0dxpHXTK5xEoapmZ7SpTyo0oImWXyy-Tqm_avWWHnXfoQqRDWiyrUcPQsS4LrXzlxizfMwgc5cMulkkPNB5CqSqkO9jXkj2KrK8qid-AksNHzsmfgQA" alt=""></figure><p><strong>Stock Prediction</strong></p><p><strong>Review Data &amp; Stock Correlation</strong></p><p>Zoom’s rapidly growing review volume is reflected in its stock price. When the noise of both the stock price and review volume data is smoothed with a 20-day moving average, the two have a 0.51 correlation coefficient. So, generally, when one goes up so does the other.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FNbCbXS2NH1IU5fIy_G0Kry4HZdfTDOy5pQfOIIIxr42LmStGxxJKH5KRLerrG0f9ke9pHFxJPCZGj1wCWk6USN8N7D-8Kwye9PYyuKJYB3gABzTPKVpyezzq7OJqm0FRBQFJlrACGp1W9e-_Q" alt=""><figcaption>Note: The parent companies of Skype (Microsoft), BlueJeans (Verizon) and Webex (Cisco) are shown in the chart above. GoToMeeting and Join.me are privately owned.</figcaption></figure><p>Stocks overall have performed well since the lockdown due to fiscal and monetary stimulus, but few have performed as well as Zoom. &nbsp;Zoom’s stock price has grown four times larger than its closest competitor since the lockdowns started and eight times larger than its closest competitor since the middle of 2019. Zoom’s average daily stock returns grew from 0.5% before the pandemic to 1.1% after the pandemic.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/te4pDczFeqFYQVkHRJdJXk9E_SORbe1fjPtRPqL7eH-JEnThErsMN4Fjlm6OibMVeihXCPjzUnlL4VAJnim7sjbpMZ-ojnLRY_u1d-IvprlwCQSUU8uuqlWiLmaAj-is335RIodvxXZZBTqEmg" alt=""></figure><p>Zoom’s review volume and stock price are not the only interesting correlation. Zoom’s review volume and trading volume have a correlation coefficient of 0.39.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XnNI4DaO8JmSeeix_TwjjWf1TW4gMVdeq_J2cv22St58nnzFf5WfexkNaGKHFpqEIaD5TkDCO_UCYyWZOxZ_1cL7_o_o5suKMDnOkDOdsAtDK7e1Ei15wRCpYo4dv40leMm0TtmJ88hoDzaZvQ" alt=""></figure><p>There are strong similarities between Zoom’s review volume and trading volume, but the two curves were a bit out of sync. Shifting review volume back 12 days raises the correlation coefficient to 0.47. This relationship could be used to reaffirm buy/sell signals from On-Balance Volume (OBV) or similar indicators.</p><p>There is also a relationship between Zoom’s review volume and stock price volatility.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZCj_crYjjKq3mGZyPKUC8gkObPvDPHrr1ZddJ7n-T-xJgkN4giKWRZvekUgSfemstnDJId9FNDp2Ja8DNLd6cxkGadAsVY5Qqf1OpN-G77X-BUWiPmCrvfmAOYQnRFvZeo2eHwO-0XNS5_lrtw" alt=""></figure><p>If we shift Zoom’s review volume back 27 days, the correlation coefficient with volatility goes from 0.06 to 0.51.<br></p><p><strong>Methodology</strong></p><p>Because there’s a clear relationship between Zoom’s online reviews and their stock data, we set out to use the review data to predict Zoom’s stock price movements. The goal was to build a machine learning model with decent accuracy and determine which features (variables) were most predictive.</p><p>Along with the review volume, review rating, the quality issues metric and basic stock price data, we used some of the most common technical indicators, including simple and exponential moving averages, Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Stochastic Oscillator, Bollinger Bands and Relative Strength Index (RSI).</p><p>We also built another feature to add context to the review data. &nbsp;We used Python’s TextBlob package to apply a sentiment score to each review text. The sentiment scores range from -1 to 1, with -1 being perfectly negative, 1 being perfectly positive and 0 being neutral. The sentiment scores are normally distributed and centered on ~0.25.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/k5UrRhRgMSaDq7MDhQb46hcymBXXz9uzJ0kXsQsGYOjChymXAcb0hRV9KyV3MsxK2BVSmkGWJjF0j0nPTLO_dlkYrlxuuHZRkg6RnloEzl3nyeq9eoNacFxw1I9mswlOcFmL5Gcy4DAddx0Juw" alt=""></figure><p>The data was split into training and test datasets, with the test dataset being the last 75 days of trading and the training dataset being the 277 trading days before that.</p><p>Several machine learning models were trained and tested, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gaussian NB, Random Forest, Adaboost and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)/LSTM. The variable being predicted was the following day’s price direction (up or down) from the opening price to the closing price.</p><p>In the entire dataset, 51.4% of the days had a price direction of “up.” So, if we used a model that guessed the majority class (up) every time, we would be correct about 51% of the time. We used this baseline accuracy as the accuracy to beat.</p><p><strong>Results</strong></p><p>Out of the standard machine learning models, the Adaboost with a Random Forest base estimator performed the best with an accuracy of 53.3%. Although this accuracy leaves something to be desired, this particular model provides us with an opportunity to evaluate the predictive power of our variables.</p><p>With decision tree models, like the Random Forest, <a href="https://medium.com/bigdatarepublic/feature-importance-whats-in-a-name-79532e59eea3">Feature Importances</a> can be calculated to determine each variables impact on the accuracy of the model. Out of all the features used in the model, the sentiment score and review volume ranked 2nd and 4th most important in terms of predictive power. Our quality issues metric did not perform as well as hoped.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4y4whSq75-9ddw29zYeSO7VTFJJk2r3IMxCKZa25RXUJS2K-nc0srFtTOcfDu0HXOZtQHBAivNS8I0rdzsYpzvZ7uwTvnvpWn5IDvey5FkuqFgGHClJlCGDgYzpkad1TWSGaOi0zVPPbPZ0NSg" alt=""></figure><p>The standard machine learning models resulted in mediocre accuracy and were quite overfit. The RNN/LSTM model improved prediction accuracy significantly. The accuracy improvement is most likely due to the RNN’s ability to learn patterns across time. &nbsp;We also added dropout layers to reduce the problem of overfitting.</p><p>Below you can see the architecture of the Recurrent Neural Network. In this simple design, each LSTM layer is followed by a Dropout layer. The Dense output layer has a sigmoid activation function which keeps outputs in the range of 0 to 1. An output greater than to 0.5 is a prediction of “up” and an output less than or equal to 0.5 is a prediction of “down.” The learning rate was 0.01, the loss was binary cross-entropy and the optimizer used was Adam. The model was trained over 400 epochs and the batch size was 15 samples. The data was preprocessed to reflect a 10-day look-back period.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Qb-0oPqiNak61VqYqqMmxzuPorQtNeHArqNQIIvUxrB0ki1HIfAzb63vjgVha3xb3u6Pry8ujsVKKaPC_4ybNbeaVDwdIreW7Va6rcidiJoJyYHudd5W6PRnxaXuxiuYSuxwO5m1A05EJL24SQ" alt=""></figure><p>If we look at the accuracy over all epochs, we see that the training and validation accuracy converges over time. Adding the Dropout layers greatly reduced overfitting. The validation accuracy peaked in epoch 339 at an accuracy of 59%.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7JdYooEefkYTX6xcGw-7Jgf40x8Xq7i6w0yw5V4oA8WIHmgRqSZHzCuduj-6sLkUnZTTVhdedRf0MKcbqSo2QOrTFNgwNnsytlTLoZp-RjvNsm4xtHX-SB5SPsFVVLCIsQTCLMosS2l__s37Fw" alt=""></figure><p>If we look at the loss over all epochs, we will notice something strange. Although the validation accuracy improved throughout training, the validation loss drifted upward. This is unusual, but a bit of research revealed that it is due to the model making worse and worse predictions on samples where it was already wrong. For example, let’s say the correct prediction for a sample was “down.” The sigmoid function would output a 0.60 (up) in the first epoch, then a 0.70 in the next epoch, a 0.80 in the next epoch and so on. The prediction was always wrong, but the sigmoid function kept outputting a worse result.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZJFPH8EGR0oe5s7Rc5eyYP625_BxkOjtQWlYWJcXukHRDZwsDNRbWKULvdKBq5-YDOXbr93ltmIZ4CAdqDOlj2MZVPKcjmS8Pxciavki0hPOYbprpPndhLrLD3lJbxA6FQHwsNHYUY3zTzNXw" alt=""></figure><p>Although the validation loss drifted slightly upward, the epoch where the model accuracy peaked (339) coincided with a local minimum in validation loss.</p><p>Below we can see a confusion matrix of the test dataset predictions. The model is more reluctant to predict up days than down days. However, when the model does predict up days, it does so with greater accuracy. The model precision (i.e. true positives over total predicted positives) is 77.8%.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/3t8PKgjXQM7Dn2k__ATFbJ5IWah4EoCx4si16XIv6ivK7m183MDAh7ds6XtdxH7VxrK9h91hC2Q6opgGdLblpzULmurE1ljonaXQjXG25eWxeYUGqy6lqUGMfhZPdkUl07Cb9AP5fe_eiuG66Q" alt=""></figure><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Zoom’s success since the COVID-19 pandemic began has caught the attention of workers, technologists and investors.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-89cfead268f30384aa7d"><div><p><em>TLDR: Simplicity is still a controversial topic. Most argue that consumers desire simpler products. Some argue that they want simplicity but only if it is executed correctly (what that means is often left undefined). And a few believe that it’s actually complexity that makes consumers buy. This disagreement is rooted in the fact that no one seems to agree on what simplicity means. I suggest avoiding using it in any professional capacity, in favor of a more precise tool kit. What motivates the buying decision are the 3 components of the Fogg Behavior Model: motivation, ability, and prompt. Motivation, in order to make the sale, can be further broken down into the Job To Be Done (why is the consumer hiring the product?) and acute satisfaction (how badly do they want it in that moment?). Ability, making a behavior easier or harder to do, can be subdivided into time, money, physical effort, mental effort, repetition, social deviance, location in space, and location in time. Getting comfortable with these concepts will give you a productive framework to work with when deciding what features to include/exclude, and help you create products people actually want to buy, use, and recommend.</em></p><p>One of the most fundamental theorems to have come out of behavior science is that <strong>shine changes behavior</strong>.</p><p>What’s shine? Shine is the emotion you feel when you feel successful. When you aced that job interview, got your first customer, or finally won that match in your game or sport. [1] By making behavior easy to do, you increase the probability that you’ll succeed instead of fail. When you succeed, you feel successful which reinforces the connection in your brain between that behavior and that positive feeling, and that leads  to behavior change.&nbsp;</p><p>Simplicity → Shine → Behavior Change.</p><p>Because simplicity means so many different things to so many different people, a more precise way to think about it is in terms of ability. High ability means a behavior is easy to do. Low ability means it’s hard to do. So when you’re thinking about consumer behavior change, think about increasing ability, making it easy to do.</p><p><em>For the purpose of this essay you can use consumer and user interchangeably.</em></p><p>Obvious right? Well, no. The problem with fields like behavior science is tool bias. Which I described in <a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/covid" target="_blank">Covid-19 And Human (Ir)Rationality — PART 1</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“This is a fascinating bias I call tool bias (if it has an official name, let me know), which ties the complexity of the tool to the perception of difficulty. Math can appear complex even when the application is very simple. Influencing behavior can appear simple even when the application is very complex. This phenomenon occurs in comedy as well. It’s easy to underestimate how difficult it is to create a good set because the tools (language) are simple, so while you laugh you think, I could do this easily.”</p></blockquote><p>I.e. behavior science suffers from hindsight bias because it’s so easy to understand. It all appears obvious ex post facto.&nbsp;</p><p>If something seems easy, we think “that must BE easy.”</p><p>But if you were to ask around as to what creates behavior change, you’d get many different answers (mainly around motivation) but making things easy to do wouldn’t be one of them. [2]</p><p>Okay, if simplicity or more precisely, increasing ability is so important (and obvious) then why are products so complicated?</p><p>Because it’s that very complexity that sells.</p><p>When we see something that’s complex, we think “that must have a lot of value.” If you’re a consultant giving simple answers to complex problems, it seems as though you’re not very smart or, at the very least, you aren’t taking it seriously. When you make it so complex that people can hardly follow along, it becomes hard for people to estimate the boundaries of your knowledge.&nbsp;</p><p>E.g. suppose you hire a consultant to help you with next year’s strategy. If they give you a thick stack of papers that supports their conclusion, you’ll perceive it more favorably than if they give you a single sheet with 2 paragraphs on it, sharing that same conclusion. Complexity acts as a heuristic for value. [3]</p><p><em>An obvious, but important nonetheless note, is that truth has to be measured by truth, not truthiness. </em><strong><em>Complexity impacts truthiness but it has no correlation with truth</em></strong><em>. I.e. just because something is complex doesn’t make it true. Just because something is simple doesn’t make it false. But that’s exactly the cognitive bias we have and partly explains our obsession with data-driven arguments. Read </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/misleadingdata?rq=data" target="_blank"><em>Your Data Is Lying To You And You’re Listening</em></a><em> for more on that.</em></p><p>Is this only true in information? No. You see the same phenomenon from consumer products to enterprise software.</p><p>According to Thompson, Hamilton, and Rust (2005), increasing the complexity of a product can have a positive effect on consumer satisfaction because of an increase in perceived capability.</p><p>Look at the following products:</p><p><strong>Stripey toothpaste: </strong>Why do they go to so much trouble to make sure stripey toothpaste comes out of the tube, well… stripey? An overly logical engineer would see that and claim that you should just mix the products. It would have the exact same effect on oral hygiene and you’d actually save on cost. But that’s only correct if your customers were logical robots. But they’re emotional humans. Consumers simply don’t believe your toothpaste has 3 functions if they don’t see it. ‘’Healthy gums. Strong teeth. Fresh breath.” Show me, don’t tell me.</p><p><strong>Dishwashing tablet: </strong>Same argument. Just blend all the ingredients into one homogenous tablet. But again, I, the consumer, wouldn’t believe you.</p><p><strong>Toilet rim block: </strong>Look at how these simple blocks have grown in complexity. Multiple liquids in a container, different colored solid spheres, sticky discs you shoot onto your bowl, etc. [4]</p><p><strong>Coffee machine: </strong>The most expensive ones have the most gizmos. More features to increase perceived capability, which is exactly what I, the consumer, want. Take Dolce Gusto machines for example. A manual lever to flip to make coffee? What am I, a 17th-century peasant?! I’ll take the model with the fancy LCD touch screen so I can feel like Louis the 14th thank you very much.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606422050075_102553"><p><strong>Cars: </strong>Steering wheels with roughly similar complexity as NASA's mission control. Mirrors that can be moved electronically, are heated, dim based on light intensity, and more. Just take a look at the incredible feature set of these 2021headlights:</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606422050075_35746"><p><strong>iOS:</strong> Remember that the original “iPhone OS” didn’t even have an Appstore yet? Just the 15 apps that shipped with the phone. Now you got an app for everything, cameras that rival mirrorless cameras and DSLRs in the right conditions, and more power than many laptops.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606422050075_27120"><div><p>It seems that if we want to sell more, we should simply add features.</p><p>Well, yes. But also… well, no.</p><p>There are many UX experts that advocate precisely this. “Simplicity is overrated and consumers, ceteris paribus, want more features because they want the most powerful products.”</p><p>This is partly true. Would you pay more for a phone that does less? It has a basic camera, or perhaps no camera, it has less memory, it’s not fast, it’s missing features (even if you don’t use them). Probably not. While one can imagine an audience of minimalists for that, one can’t imagine that they’d pay more for it than the flagship phone which sets the anchor for that particular price hierarchy.</p><p>But if that’s the whole story, that raises the question, why do products ever get disrupted? Surely, if features sell then Yahoo wouldn’t have gotten disrupted by Google. Or Netflix by Blockbuster. Or Facebook by Myspace. Or any other startup, since pretty much all of them started very simple.</p><p>The erroneous assumption here is that simple means getting rid of features. But a car that’s missing two wheels, the engine, and the body, that’s not simplicity. That’s not even a car. A bagless vacuum cleaner — &gt; a cordless bagless vacuum cleaner — &gt; the Dysons we have now with all kinds of attachments, different vacuum heads, and automatically adjusting suction levels… now you’ve got my attention. The “simple” Dysons still had high usability despite lower capability. So it’s not just about removing features, it’s about being diligent about which features you do add. And your customers are the arbiter that decide whether or not you got it right.</p><p>On top of that, Rust, Thompson, and Hamilton (2006) demonstrated that an increase in features (even the right features) doesn’t automatically translate into more consumer satisfaction. In fact, as perceived capability increases, perceived usability decreases. This is known as feature fatigue. (Thompson, Hamilton &amp; Rust, 2005; See also Kemenade, 2018).</p><p>So if we can’t simply add or remove features, how should we think about getting consumers to buy?</p><p>The user needs to want it (motivation), they need to be able to buy it (have the ability), and be provoked into buying it (prompt). (Fogg, 2009). Ability usually isn’t the most constraining factor. If a consumer really wants to buy something, they’ll take care of any cognitive dissonance for you. E.g. “I don’t have the space for this new guitar. But damn, I really want it. Okay, I’ll just clean up the attic, and then I’ll have enough space.” (Which they won’t do). Not carrying (enough) money is also not really an issue anymore with Apple Pay and the like.&nbsp;</p><p>You could imagine a physical constraint. E.g. they wanna buy but the product is too big to take home in their car. That’s a place where you could offer some delivery service to solve for ability. E.g. Ikea or AptDeco. Or your site only accepts credit cards, which are never used in The Netherlands. In which case the user probably wouldn’t buy because it’s too much of a hassle. </p><p>Prompts aren’t perfect in 2020 but rarely do products fail because they were so amazing yet the company simply forgot to tell people about it. And pretty much the only thing marketers actually understand is CTA: Call To Action, which is just another word for prompt. So buying is primarily a motivation issue. And secondarily an …</p></div></div></div>

        <div>
                      <p><span><strong>What was the last product demo you saw?<br>
Not on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, they’re all over those, but on tv, billboards or press (does press still exist?).<br>
You just don’t see agencies doing them anymore.<br>
Odd, because, and I hope I’m not giving away any trade secrets here, the goal of most advertising is to persuade people that the product featured is good.<br>
Ideally, REALLY good.<br>
So showing it in action, performing well, seems like it might be a good way to go?<br>
Because most purchasing decisions are based on what a product does. But sometimes in ad agencies, we can get too distracted with our own fancy theories and philosophies.<br>
Not just in agencies, sometimes when I teach I’ll review work that, although clever, doesn’t feel like it’ll sell anything.<br>
It doesn’t feel like it’s trying to sell anything.<br>
Would you buy that cereal because you’re told it’s what the cool folks eat?<br>
Or a computer because the company that makes it has some very progressive social policies?<br>
Maybe.<br>
But most wouldn’t, they want to know what’s in it for them.<br>
My advice when such a situation arises is always the same; imagine you’re with a friend, face to face, how would you persuade them to buy this product?.<br>
They know they can’t waffle and bullshit friends, so they stop trying. Instead, they start thinking about why their friend may actually part with money for this product.<br>
Focussing on what it does.<br>
How it may help them.<br>
The ideas often become less grandiose and more like common-sense advice.<br>
Which is more persuasive.<br>
As the saying goes – Don’t tell me you’re funny, make me laugh.<br>
So why are we producing less product demos?<br>
Less products to warrant that type of advertising today?<br>
Would that kind of <em>‘hard sell’</em> advertising reflect badly on a brand today? Or that it would reflect badly on us?<br>
(Answers on a postcard, etc, etc.)</strong></span></p>
<p><span>p.s. &nbsp;I couldn’t help wondering if the British Government spent less money telling people what to do about Covid-19 and more on demonstrating the benefits of wearing masks and washing hands, the situation may be a bit better?</span></p>
<p><span>E.g. 1. Masks.</span></p>

<p><span><em>E.g. 2. Soap.<br>
</em></span></p>


<p><span>When I gathered together this bunch, I didn’t look through awards sites or annuals, I just tried to remember product demonstrations, ones that had stuck with me.</span><br>
<span>Consequently, there are some ads in here that I couldn’t tell you when or where they were done, like Tonka and the nail varnish ad.</span><br>
<span>But having collated all of this ‘unfashionable’ work, it dawned on me that most of it was created by the most fashionable agencies.<br>
At least, the most fashionable in their of the day.<br>
DDB, PKL, WRG, GGT, BBH, WCRS, DDB, AMV, APPLE.<br>
Written by the likes of George Lois, Roy Grace, Dave Trott, David Abbott, John Webster, Ron Collins.<br>
Maybe they knew something we don’t?</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
    <p><img src="https://yusufhegazy.com/img/bof-normies/header.png" alt="Fractal Tree"></p><h2 id="what-is-a-buffer-anyway">What is a Buffer anyway?</h2>
<p>We can think of buffers as containers to hold our data for later use, it’s not really something specific to computer science; In fact, we have buffers in electronics, mechanics, chemistry and even politics!
We can say that the word buffer is just a fancy name for a placeholder (temporary storage)!</p>
<h2 id="buffer-in-computer-science">Buffer in Computer Science</h2>
<p>Now, it’s time to get more technical and get to know buffers more in computer science!</p>
<p>Online video streaming is a pretty good application of buffering, back in the old days we would see YouTube showing that nostalgic loading bar while waiting the video to load and that’s exactly why we use buffers!
We need to store video data in someplace so that when we need that data we can load it directly from the computer’s memory since we can’t really have our internet connection playback videos in realtime without having some temporarily storage for data to reside in, and that’s the reason why livestreams never sync with realtime and have a couple seconds delay.</p>
<p>here is a more lower level representation of a buffer:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>#define BUFSIZE 1024
</span><span></span><span>char</span> buffer[BUFSIZE];
size_t len;

<span>// ... later
</span><span></span><span>while</span>((len<span>=</span>read(STDIN, <span>&amp;</span>buffer, BUFSIZE)) <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span>)
    write(STDOUT, buffer, len);
</code></pre></div><p>This snippet basically check for data available then reads it from the standard input (command line) and writes that data back to the standard output (command line too).</p>
<h2 id="buffer-overflows">Buffer Overflows!</h2>
<p>It’s time for the good stuff now!</p>
<p>Let’s say we have an arbitrary variable of size 5 bytes, and we stored some value in that variable which <em>exceeds 5 bytes</em>, that’s a simple buffer overflow!</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> someVariable[<span>5</span>];

<span>/* we are trying to copy 15 bytes to a 5 bytes sized variable */</span>
memcpy(someVariable, <span>"Hello, world!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, <span>15</span>); 

printf(someVariable);
</code></pre></div><p>We encounter buffer overflows more frequently than we imagine, ever seen <code>Segmentation Fault</code> appear in your C program out of nowhere? That’s also a buffer overflow but your computer has prevented it from causing any damage and stopped the program from running.</p>
<p>Let’s get back to our 5 bytes overflown variable example. What happens to the overflown data? Where is it’s destination? Does it get lost in the void of nothingness?</p>
<p>Nope, in fact we just overwrite other data when we overflow any variable, and that’s the core of our problem. We can’t just overwrite data and act as if nothing happened. What if we overwrite important data? What if we can overwrite data related to process memory and already running programs?</p>
<p>These are all possibilities which are just a mere consequence of buffer overflows and can cause great damage to computers</p>
<h2 id="weaponizing-buffer-overflows">Weaponizing Buffer Overflows</h2>
<p>A basic technique used by hackers when exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities is determining the place where data gets overwritten and <strong>handcrafting</strong> the overflown data to inject <strong>arbitrary code</strong> in the program, imagine if that program runs at elevated privileges and a hacker takes control of it’s execution flow, you get <em>pwned.</em></p>
<p>And that’s just the basic technique in abusing buffer overflow vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2 id="am-i-really-safe">Am I Really Safe?</h2>
<p>Sadly, yes you are safe.</p>
<p>Buffer overflows aren’t as popular in 2020 (as of writing this article) as they used to be back in the old days of computers, all modern processors/operating systems have strict rules and mitigations for all the paradigms and techniques of buffer overflows.</p>
<p>Some of these famous mitigations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>ASLR</strong> (Address Space Layout Randomization)</p>
<p>Basically randomizes all the memory addresses at runtime whenever you execute any program so it makes it impossible to hardcode memory addresses for exploiting buffer overflow attacks</p>
<p>i.e: the exploit needs to be completely dynamic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NX Bit</strong></p>
<p>Basically marks areas of memory as non-executable, prevents hackers from injecting malicious code into areas of memory in an attempt to execute it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stack Canaries</strong></p>
<p>Basically generates some random value in memory at runtime and checks before returning from any function if that random value got overwritten or not, if yes then program exits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And these are just some of the basic mitigation used in 2020.</p>
<p>But again, <em>these doesn’t really make your computer invincible</em> as much as making it just harder for an attacker to compromise your system using buffer overflow attacks.</p>
<p>Hackers still can bypass these mitigations using underhanded methods such as bruteforce and leaking addresses from memory but using these mitigations correctly can make buffer overflows nearly useless.</p>
<p>It’s also worthy to mention that buffer overflows can be prevented from the programmers side by following the coding best practices and avoiding unsanitized input etc…</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog">
                    <h2>Best so far</h2>
<p>I have been writing every day for more than a month now, and it has not been apparent to me that I got any better.</p>
<p>I make mistakes when writing the first draft. I butcher some of the sentences. Hemingway wants me to change the structure of every sentence. </p>
<p>It is all the same.</p>
<p>But yesterday, I have <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/when-productivity-increases">written the best article</a> I have written so far.</p>
<p>It took much more time than usual to finish. It required me to do research. It required me to make custom images for it, but I did all of that it.</p>
<p>What really caught me off guard is that I  edited it. </p>
<p>I really hate the editing process, at least I did hate it. Ever since I started writing an actual novel book and thousands of people started reading what I write, I started feeling conscious of my mistakes.</p>
<p>Instead of just trying to finish the task straight away, I had to make sure that at least the text itself had no mistakes. I knew that it wouldn’t go in vain and people will be reading it.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage of editing that I found is that you learn a lot when editing. You see the common trends in mistakes. You start to understand how you write and what mood does your writing give.</p>
<p>That has enabled me to accelerate my learning.</p>
<h2>How I started writing the blog</h2>
<p>I started with just a simple resolution, on October the 12th, to write every single day a piece of writing that others could read. It didn’t have to be long or amazingly good. It just had to be some writing.</p>
<p>That is how a person that never written anything half-decent can start writing.</p>
<h3>How I started writing a novel</h3>
<p>After around a month, I was drained reading the novels that had a thin plot and were just straight up badly written. So I had to give it a try myself. I had no experience in writing and had no idea how to write a novel either. The first chapters, expectedly, were tough to write. But after it started flowing as if it was my second nature. It became much easier to write a novel.</p>
<h2>My plan</h2>
<p>It all started with me promising to write at least 200 words per day, and now I write around 2 thousand per day. Plus all the editing. To tell you the truth, I would off never expected everything to end up like this.</p>
<p>By reading this, you might think that I am planning on going somewhere and setting myself crazy goals that I want to achieve? Well yes and no.</p>
<p>I want to achieve great goals, but setting them is not the ideal way for me to do it.</p>
<p>I want to get to the goals unexpectedly and with the habits instead of sheer motivation. </p>
<p>Ever since I started with habits, I don’t believe in motivation anymore. Motivation is best used to start habits, but in the long run, it is meaningless. You better use your motivation on starting a new habit, then forcing yourself to the next goal.</p>
<p>When I wake up in the morning, I don’t have to motivate myself to write. I just do it. It is the next thing that I do after a shower, as easy as that. This understanding enables me to occupy my head with other things that truly matter.</p>
<p>The only thing I am planning on making different is spending more time on my writing on the weekends. I can see that this area can be scaled. It can be scaled well enough actually to give a benefit to others.</p>
<p>That means that if I put extra effort into articles that will actually rank and become higher indexed on Google. Then I will also be able to get new traffic from SEO, which means I can help even more people.</p>
<p>I have to say that I really under appreciate what is happening right now with everyone being able to write. It is a blessing that I should have been using from the day I got a computer. </p>
<p>If you still haven’t started writing, then:</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later.</p>

<h3>Apple Silicon M1</h3>



<p>So Apple is migrating CPU architectures <span id="easy-footnote-1-36"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-36" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/mac/m1&quot;>https://www.apple.com/mac/m1</a>"><sup>1</sup></a></span>. Again. For the <em>third time</em>. Now from x86 (bought from Intel) to ARM:self-designed, baked by TSMC. We can all read up on their bombastic claims and decide if its good or not. Good performance? Good battery life? But bad for environment as nothing is repairable or upgradable? Everybody has an opinion. Mine? I personally think it’s an interesting, good move… but lets talk about something else.</p>



<h3>Rosetta of 2005</h3>



<p>Let’s draw your attention to the <em>transition</em> <em>period</em> side of things. Cast your minds back to 2005, when Apple migrated from PowerPC to x86 architecture. “How is that possible? All our software would no longer run!” – users might shout. But a key piece of technology was developed to smooth out the transition, Rosetta <span id="easy-footnote-2-36"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-36" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/the-brains-behind-apples-rosetta-transitive&quot;>https://www.cnet.com/news/the-brains-behind-apples-rosetta-transitive</a>"><sup>2</sup></a></span>  <span id="easy-footnote-3-36"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-36" title="<a href=&quot;https://thenextweb.com/insider/2011/10/22/how-one-of-apples-most-important-pieces-of-software-came-from-a-small-uk-startup&quot;>https://thenextweb.com/insider/2011/10/22/how-one-of-apples-most-important-pieces-of-software-came-from-a-small-uk-startup</a>"><sup>3</sup></a></span>. It was developed by a company called Transitive, in Manchester, UK. Coincidentally, I was lucky enough to work there as well. But I joined a few years after Rosetta had been unveiled, and did not get a chance to join it’s development effort. However, for many a year Transitive remained my benchmark for an ideal workplace.</p>

<p>It is important to understand how really, <em>really</em> complicated that solution was. It is <em>not</em> <em>only</em> an emulator. I’ve written emulators. It wasn’t rocket science. The big brains behind the software is a real time, dynamic binary translation engine, reading in instructions from one CPU architecture, and figuring out how to produce code for another architecture altogether. Where no direct 1-to-1 mapping of such operations may even exist. Or a different amount of registers are available. Or many, many other challenges – to list most of them i would need a series of blogs. But let us review what Steve Jobs claimed in 2005:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="230" src="https://i1.wp.com/occasional.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rosetta-1.jpg?resize=300%2C230&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/occasional.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rosetta-1.jpg?resize=300%2C230&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>– Dynamic Binary translation<br>– Runs existing Apps!<br>– Transparent to users<br>– Lightweight<br><strong><em>– Fast (<span>enough</span>)</em></strong></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In my humble opinion, the key take-away was the last point there. It showed that Apple (Transitive) did made it work! But they wanted to downplay user expectations. Maybe they were not 100% confident?</p>



<h3>Rosetta of 2020</h3>



<p>Now back to the future (or rather, the present). This time we have Rosetta 2. It is no longer built by Transitive, as that has been acquired by IBM back in 2008 <span id="easy-footnote-4-36"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-36" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-acquires-transitive&quot;>https://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-acquires-transitive</a>"><sup>4</sup></a></span>. But the experts are still out there, the technology has been proven, and Apple built a new one.</p>



<p>The success of Apple Silicon will be defined by how good the hardware is. The success of the transition will be defined by <em>two</em> things: how well Rosetta 2 performs, and how fast software providers distribute updated versions of their applications. Popular tech news articles will once again briefly-or-not mention Rosetta 2, most likely calling it an emulation layer. You, my dear reader, by now should guess that it is <strong>not just that</strong>. Once again, it is an amazing solution, a complicated engine to perform difficult computational tasks, solve register and memory management issues, perform as fast as possible (or better!!), never crash, and handle anything that is thrown at it. There should be no option to fail here. No place to </p>



<pre>log.error("TODO: finish this instruction translation later");</pre>



<p>So… What is special about the second version <span id="easy-footnote-5-36"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-36" title="<a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/about_the_rosetta_translation_environment?language=objc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/about_the_rosetta_translation_environment"><sup>5</sup></a></span>? Let’s have a quick look at Apple developer documentation.<br></p>



<blockquote><p>“If an executable contains only Intel instructions, macOS automatically launches Rosetta and begins the translation process. When translation finishes, the system launches the translated executable in place of the original. However, the translation process takes time, so users might perceive that translated apps launch or run more slowly at times,” </p></blockquote>



<p> It’s not all powerful, Apple lists instruction set extensions and things they don’t support yet: kernel extensions, hypervisors running x86 VMs, vector instructions… But it is still fascinating. Let’s take their example: your software is already ‘new’, compiled for the ARM architecture. But it has plugins you want to use, and those are not. In theory, Rosetta 2 should be able to run the whole process ‘translated’, and handle the old plugins fine. So what did Tim Apple boast about Rosetta this time?</p>

<p>Notice that key differences in the presentation. </p>



<ul><li>No longer did Apple downplay user expectations: “fast enough” vs “Fast performance”. To me it shows they have more confidence in it, and a more powerful tool at their fingertips.</li><li>Translated at install time: now that sounds cool. Does that mean, that if you attempt to install an x86 app, it is completely translated immediately, and you have a translated binary ready to go? That is generally called “static binary translation”, but has great limitations for code that is loaded dynamically.</li><li>Dynamic translation for JITs: this means they not only do static translation. They support what is called “self modifying code”, where static translation is not possible. What is the value in translating the code ahead-of-time, if the code will go and change itself?</li><li>Transparent to the user: now that does not change. It must still remain the most amazing software you will never see!</li></ul>



<p>Most likely it has a multi-layered caching/storage solution of translated code to avoid translating the same things over and over again. But note that warning in the quote above: “…the translation process takes time, so users might perceive that translated apps launch or run more slowly at times”.<br>It is important to understand this. At first launch of an app, all code is encountered for the first time. So Rosetta 2 must go instruction by instruction, decode its function, check for side effects, and produce good ARM alternatives. Then cache/store the results. Then chain those together. Now this process takes time, of course, and the application may appear to run slower. But what Apple is banking on – is that their chip is actually so good that it can offset that slowdown and in the end, it is not impossible for the application to actually – at least perceivably – run even faster than on a previous Intel based mac!</p>



<h3>So How Fast is it, anyway?</h3>



<p>Now, the first benchmarks are already pouring in. Just a quick shout-out – I have just purchased an HP Elitebook with a Ryzen 7 Pro 4750U CPU. I absolutely love it. But lets have a quick look at the first numbers arstechnica provided <span id="easy-footnote-6-36"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-36" title="<a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/google-chrome-is-available-as-an-apple-m1-native-app-today&quot;>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/google-chrome-is-available-as-an-apple-m1-native-app-today</a>"><sup>6</sup></a></span>.</p>



<blockquote><p>Jetstream is the broadest of the three benchmarks shown here—it combines an enormous number of JavaScript and WebAssembly benchmarks. Workloads include regex parsing, list sorting, ray tracing and (much, much) more.</p></blockquote>



<ul><li>HP Elitebook Ryzen 7 4750U Google Chrome         <strong><em>129.8</em></strong></li><li><em>Apple M1 Mac Mini Google Chrome x86_64            <strong>93.1</strong></em></li></ul>



<p>.. thats a ~28 percent performance hit on a really heavy benchmark. I give it a 9 out of 10. But…</p>



<ul><li>Apple M1 Mac Mini Google Chrome M1 Native.      <strong><em>156.9</em></strong></li></ul>



<p>… Apple, your ARM chip outperforms my brand new spanking HP laptop. You really pulled a rabbit out of the hat this time.</p>







<p>Disclaimer 🙂<br>I’m not an ‘Apple fanboy’. I have never purchased Apple products myself but actually owned some. But I am a big fanboy of amazing hardware and software. Which Rosetta 2 most definitely is. As well as M1.<br></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I write and prefer code that fits within 80 columns in <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> and other projects – and there are reasons for it. I’m a little bored by the people who respond and say that they have 400 inch monitors already and they can use them.</p>



<p>I too have multiple large high resolution screens – but writing wide code is still a bad idea! So I decided I’ll write down my reasoning once and for all!</p>



<h2>Narrower is easier to read</h2>



<p>There’s a reason newspapers and magazines have used narrow texts for centuries and in fact even books <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_length">aren’t using long lines</a>. For most humans, it is simply easier on the eyes and brain to read texts that aren’t using really long lines. This has been known for a very long time.</p>



<p>Easy-to-read code is easier to follow and understand which leads to fewer bugs and faster debugging.</p>



<h2>Side-by-side works better</h2>



<p>I <em>never</em> run windows full sized on my screens for anything except watching movies. I frequently have two or more editor windows next to each other, sometimes also with one or two extra terminal/debugger windows next to those. To make this feasible and still have the code readable, it needs to fit “wrapless” in those windows.</p>



<p>Sometimes reading a code diff is easier side-by-side and then too it is important that the two can fit next to each other nicely.</p>



<h2>Better diffs</h2>



<p>Having code grow vertically rather than horizontally is beneficial for diff, git and other tools that work on changes to files. It reduces the risk of merge conflicts and it makes the merge conflicts that still happen easier to deal with.</p>



<h2>It encourages shorter names</h2>



<p>A side effect by strictly not allowing anything beyond column 80 is that it becomes really hard to use those terribly annoying 30+ letters java-style names on functions and identifiers. A function name, and especially local ones, should be short. Having long names make them really hard to read and makes it really hard to spot the difference between the other functions with similarly long names where just a sub-word within is changed.</p>



<p>I know especially Java people object to this as they’re trained in a different culture and say that a method name should rather include a lot of details of the functionality “to help the user”, but to me that’s a weak argument as all non-trivial functions will have more functionality than what can be expressed in the name and thus the user needs to know how the function works <em>anyway.</em></p>



<p>I don’t mean 2-letter names. I mean long enough to make sense but not be ridiculous lengths. Usually within 15 letters or so.</p>



<h2>Just a few spaces per indent level</h2>



<p>To make this work, and yet allow a few indent levels, the code basically have to have small indent-levels, so I prefer to have it set to two spaces per level.</p>



<h2>Many indent levels is wrong anyway</h2>



<p>If you do a lot of indent levels it gets really hard to write code that still fits within the 80 column limit. That’s a subtle way to suggest that you should not write functions that needs or uses that many indent levels. It should then rather be split out into multiple smaller functions, where then each function won’t need that many levels!</p>



<h2>Why exactly 80?</h2>



<p>Once upon the time it was of course because terminals had that limit and these days the exact number 80 is not a must. I just happen to think that the limit has worked fine in the past and I haven’t found any compelling reason to change it since.</p>



<p>It also has to be a hard and fixed limit as if we allow a few places to go beyond the limit we end up on a slippery slope and code slowly grow wider over time – I’ve seen it happen in many projects with “soft enforcement” on code column limits.</p>



<h2>Enforced by a tool</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a>, we have ‘checksrc’ which will yell errors at any user trying to build code with a too long line present. This is good because then we don’t have to “waste” human efforts to point this out to contributors who offer pull requests. The tool will point out such mistakes with ruthless accuracy.</p>

<p>I have to admit, my research blog posts are getting longer and longer. From one
side I find it genuinely encouraging, because if one gets so much information
just by scratching the topic, imagine what’s hidden beneath the surface! One
university professor once said “what could be interesting in databases?”, and
it turns out freaking a lot! On the other side it certainly poses problems for
potential readers. To overcome them I would suggest an interesting approach:
print this blog post out, or open it on your tablet/e-reader, where you can
make notes with a pencil or markers. Now while reading it try to spot ideas
particularly exciting for you and mark them. Along the way there would be
definitely some obscure parts or questions, write them on the sides as well.
You can experiment with the diagrams, changing or extending them, or just
drawing funny faces. But do not read everything at once, have no fear of
putting it aside for a while, and read in chunks that are convenient for you.
Some parts could be skipped as the text is build out of relatively independent
topics. The table of contents can help and guide you. Having said that we’re
ready to embark on the journey.</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Whenever we speak about indexes, especially in PostgreSQL context, there is a
lot to talk about: B-tree, Hash, GiST, SP-GiST, GIN, BRIN, RUM. But what if I
tell you that even the first item in this list alone hiding astonishing number
of interesting details and years of research? In this blog post I’ll try to
prove this statement, and we will be concerned mostly with B-tree as a data
structure.</p>
<p><img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/btree-joke.png" width="80%"></p>

<p>Let’s start systematically and take a look at the definition first:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and
allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic
time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is your first association with the concept of B-tree? Mine is “old and
well researched, or in other words boring”. And indeed apparently it was first
introduced in <a href="https://infolab.usc.edu/csci585/Spring2010/den_ar/indexing.pdf">1970</a>! Not only that, already in 1979 they
were <a href="http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~ad/M149/ubiquitous_btree.pdf">ubiquitous</a>. Does it mean there is nothing exciting left any
more? Once upon a time I came across a remarkable read called
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1561/1900000028">Modern B-Tree techniques</a> which inspired me to dig
deeper into the topic and read bunch of shiny new whitepapers. Afterwards
totally by chance I’ve stumbled upon a book “Database Internals: A Deep Dive
into How Distributed Data Systems Work”, which contains great sections on
B-tree design. Both works were the triggers to write this blog post. What was I
saying about nothing exciting left? At the end I couldn’t be more wrong.</p>
<p>It turns out that there are multitude of interesting ideas and techniques
around B-Trees. They’re all coming from the desire to satisfy different (often
incompatible) needs, as well as adapt to emerging hardware. To demonstrate how
many of those exist, lets play a game. Below you can find a table of names I’ve
found in various science papers, together with a couple of silly names I’ve
come up myself. Can you find out the fake ones?</p>
<table>

</table>

<p>Any ideas? Well, I have a confession to make – all of them are real, I just
don’t have enough imagination to come up with such names. Having this in mind
hopefully you understand that if we want to make a survey, the first step would
be to establish some classification. Not only this will help us to structure
the material, but also will explain why on earth anyone would need to invent so
many variations of what we though was so simple!</p>
<h2 id="2-rum-conjecture">2. RUM conjecture</h2>
<p>To classify different index access methods we need to think about the following
ambitious question – is there anything common between almost any index access
method? The authors of <a href="https://stratos.seas.harvard.edu/files/stratos/files/rum.pdf">RUM conjecture</a> provide an interesting
insight about this topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fundamental challenges that every researcher, systems architect, or
designer faces when designing a new access method are how to minimize, i)
read times, ii) update cost , and iii) memory (or storage) overhead.</p>
<p>In this paper, we conjecture that when optimizing the read-update-memory
overheads, optimizing in any two areas negatively impacts the third</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This essentially states that if an index access method could be specified as a
point inside “Read”, “Update” (on the Fig. 1 it’s called “Write” for
convenience of drawing), “Memory” space we can observe an interesting
invariant. Every time we modify one index access method to have less overhead
for reading or memory footprint (i.e. shift the corresponding point closer to
“Read”/”Memory” corners), we inevitably loose on the updating workload (i.e.
getting further away from “Write” corner).</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>In fact as a non-scientist I would even speculate that there should be another
dimension called “Complexity”, but the idea is still clear. I will try to show
this invariant at work via examples in this blog post, but it already gives us
some ground under the feet and opportunity to visually represent different
versions of B-tree by moving point on the triangle back and forth. But first
let’s recall the basics.</p>
<h2 id="3-b-tree-basics">3. B-tree basics</h2>
<p>So what is B-tree? Well, it’s a tree data structure: a root node, some number
of branch nodes (marked grey) and a bunch of leaf nodes (marked green):</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/btree.png" width="100%">
<br>
<figcaption>
Fig 2. B-tree nodes arrangement
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Every node of this tree is usually a page of some certain size and contains
keys (shaded slices of a node) and pointers to other nodes (empty slices with
arrows). Keys on page are kept in sorted order to facilitate fast search within
a page.</p>
<p>The original B-tree design assumed to have user data in all nodes,
branch and leaf. But nowadays the standard approach is a variation called
B<sup>+</sup>-tree, where user data is present only in leaf nodes and branch
nodes contains separator keys (pivot tuples in PostgreSQL terminology). In this
way separation between branch and leave nodes become more strict, allowing
better flexibility for choosing format of former and making deletion operations
can affect only latter. In fact the original B-tree design is barely worth
mentioning these days and I’m doing this just to be precise. Since
B<sup>+</sup>-tree is sort of default design, we’ll use B-tree and
B<sup>+</sup>-tree interchangeably in this text from now on. An interesting
thing to mention here is that the only requirements for separator keys is to
guide search algorithm to a correct leaf node. As long as they fulfil this
condition they can contain anything, no other requirements exist.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, only child pointers are truly necessary in this design, but
quite often databases also maintain additional neighbour pointers, e.g. what you
can see on the Fig. 2 between the leaf nodes. It could be helpful for some
operations like index scan, but need to be taken into account for node
split/merge operations. PostgreSQL uses <a href="https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy460/pdf/p650-lehman.pdf">Lehman-Yao</a> version,
called B<sub>link</sub>-tree, with links to both left and right sibling nodes
(the left link one is actually not presented in the original
B<sub>link</sub>-tree design, and it makes backward scan somewhat interesting),
and there are even implementations like WiredTiger with
<a href="https://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger/blob/f08bc4b18612ef95a39b12166abcccf207f91596/src/include/btmem.h#L550">parent pointers</a>.</p>
<p>Having all this in place one can perform a search query by following the path
marked red on the Fig. 2, first hitting the root, finding a proper separator
key, following a downlink and landing on a correct page where we deploy binary
search to find the resulting key.</p>
<p>Until now, we were talking only about static parts of B-tree design, but of
course there is more to it. For example there is one dynamic aspect of much
importance (quite often it even scares developers like a nightmare), namely
page splits. What do we need to do when there is a new value to insert, but the
target page does not have enough space like on the following diagram?</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/page-split-1.png" width="60%">
<br>
<figcaption>
Fig 3. B-tree page split (a)
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What happens here is we’re trying to insert the new value (shaded box) into the
page with not enough space for it. To maintain the three balanced we need to
allocate another leaf page, distribute keys between old and new leaf, promote a
new separator key into the parent page and update all required links
(left/right siblings if present):</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/page-split-2.png" width="60%">
<br>
<figcaption>
Fig 4. B-tree page split (b)
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Curiously enough the new separator key could be chosen freely, it could be any
value as long as it separates both pages. We can see what does it change in the
optimization section.</p>
<p>Locking is obviously an important part of a page split. No one wants to end up
with concurrency issues when pages get updated while in the middle of a split,
so a page to be split is write-locked as well as e.g. right sibling to update
left-link if present.</p>
<p>As you can see, page splits are introducing performance overhead. We need to
bring in a new page, move elements around and everything should be consistent
and correctly locked. And already at this pretty much basic point we already
can see some interesting trade-offs. For example B*-tree modification tries to
rebalance data between neighbouring nodes to postpone page split as long as
possible. In terms of trade-offs it looks like a balance between complexity and
insert overhead.</p>
<p>I didn’t tell you everything about B<sub>link</sub>-tree and it’s going to be our next
topic example in this section. Not only Lehman-Yao version adds a link to the
neighbour, it also introduces a “high key” to each page, which is an upper bound
on the keys that are allowed on page. While obviously introducing a bit memory
overhead those two changes make it possible to detect a concurrent page split
by checking the page high key, which allows the tree to be searched …</p></div></div>

      <p>I’m not fat. There I said it, I should feel better about myself, right? Size is just a number. Right? Come on you know it’s true, size, weight and all that jazz is just a BS figure on the scale. That’s what we tell ourselves to make us feel better.</p>

<p>I’m obese, my medical BMI is 42.0. I’m 335 pounds. As Penn Jillette would say, I’m a “fat fuck”. I’m tired of being a “fat fuck” or as my wife prefers a “big guy”.</p>



<p>I’m an audiobook guy. I’m in love with Audible, she is very wonderful service to have, she reads to me every day, all day. About two weeks ago, I was bored, and she suggested Presto, a book by Penn Jillette about how he lost 100 pounds. I was bored, lazy and waiting for someone so I bought the book. Oh my gosh, the language is obscene, but the author is hilarious and entertaining. I could not put the book down. It made me want to toss the skinny white peppermint mocha and bananas in the trash…</p>

<p>Basically, Penn is a obese guy like me, well he was, he was 330 pounds at his highest. He went to the hospital for heart issues and nearly died. On a fist full of pills to keep his blood pressure less than the voltage of an outlet in Europe he embarked on a crazy, all in diet consisting of potatoes for two weeks. I like his style, he’s an all or nothing guy like me. Either give me the steak, the ice cream and the sides or give me nothing. I want to eat big; I want to live big. Moderation is bullshit as Penn would say, I would agree! I don’t do anything in moderation. If I’m going to do something, it’s all-in baby. When in Vegas last summer, I was the dipshit who went all in with a pair of kings in my hand and straight on the table; that’s me baby, not the smartest guy but hey I like to live it big.</p>

<p>I don’t do keto, I don’t do paleo, but when I do diet, I go really big, I go to Costco and literally buy everything I need to be successful on that plan, I research, I plan. It’s just like thanksgiving this year; I researched, I planned, I went to Costco and planned out each and every ingredient. I was diligent. Every doctor, health coach and fitness instructor has told me that my relationship with food is fucked up. Well, not fucked up, but bad; unhealthy. As Penn would say your life sucks if you’re taking diet advice from a Las Vegas Magician, well, Penn, my life does suck. I can’t breathe outside very well, hell, I get windy walking to the park. I’m an obese guy, I have a CPAP machine, I’m 335 pounds, I can barely do the things I want to do, basic stuff; sleep and wake rested, eat and not feel sick, go for a walk and not get winded. I’m half Penn’s age and his same weight… It’s time for a change.</p>



<p>The plan according to Penn’s buddy, Cray Ray, aka “Ray Cronise” is to do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Eat nothing but potatoes for two weeks. Boiled, baked, steamed, roasted; does not matter, just no salt, oil, or sugar. Plain, nothing added, no salt, no butter, no pepper, no olive oil, just a plain, boring potato. Sweet, red, yellow, gold, purple, do not be a racist pig about potatoes, eat the potato rainbow, but just potatoes. Feel free to pig out on potatoes; just no fries or chips, that’s the beautiful potato ruined by Americans</li>
  <li>Contrast showers: Humans have conquered winter &amp; cold. Therefore, in order to get back to the biologically true lifestyle we’ve grown as a species as, we need to bring back the cold. Turn down the thermostat and cycle 10 seconds hot; 30 seconds cold showers for 5 minutes. It’s brutal but the time goes by shockingly fast</li>
  <li>After two weeks on potatoes, you go to a plant based, vegan lifestyle until you hit your target weight</li>
</ol>



<p>One big thing with CrayRay and Penn is the need for a scale, the smartass of scales. On an impluse I plopped down $100 for the <a href="https://www.withings.com/us/en/body-plus">Withings Body + scale</a>. It’s been 10 days! 10 DAYS!!! I’m 326.4, on day 2 of the plan. In 10 days, 1 of which involving nothing but potatoes, I’ve lost 9 pounds. This is AMAZING.</p>

<p>On day 1, it’s black Friday, or sucker day of the year. Everyone piles in their car after a Thanksgiving Day hang over consisting of pie and turkey, to go buy more stuff to stuff into their garage in six months. It’s all American in style and glory. What am I do? Well, shopping for TVs on Amazon like every other fat guy scared out of his mind of COVID-19. I’m sitting on my couch waiting for the oven, 350 degrees for 45 minutes, to produce 9 potatoes. That’s right 9 potatoes, or about 1000 ish calories. Once done cooking, I scarf down one single sweet potato. It’s sweet (no shit sherlock), delicious and surprisingly moist. I like it, I chase it with 4 tiny petite potatoes and some black coffee. This diet is sure boring.</p>

<p>Lunch time rolls around and I make some food for the kiddo and thanksgiving dinner for lunch for the wife. What do I have? If you guessed potatoes, you’d win the prize! I had 2 potatoes, a red and white. It was bland, boring and good.</p>

<p>A car ride nap, so more black coffee and about 2 liters of water later, we’re sitting down to dinner. I made peanut noodles for the wife, mac and cheese with some TG leftovers for the baby. I have 3 more potatoes, a gold, a red and a sweet potato. 2 potatoes into the meal, I’m stuffed. STUFFED ON TWO POTATOES?!?!??! Yeah, I save the sweet potato for dessert and decide to count my potatoes.</p>

<p>A few days ago, while prepping for thanksgiving, I bought 10 pounds of potatoes. I thought that was a LOT of potatoes, but when I counted it out I had around 20 potatoes left. That’s enough to feed a family a four a potato a night for a week, but for a guy living on potatoes? It’s more like two days if I’m lucky, so I head to Costco.</p>

<p>I love Costco. Everything there is a deal, no matter what the idiots on Life Hacker tell you. I love their steak, their fruit and yes, I love their clothes and bedding. But potatoes, that’s where you really make off like bandits. The potatoes were on sale today too.</p>

<p>I knew to continue the diet I needed to account for 14 days of potatoes, less today and the 1.5 I had in revere; thus, I knew I need about 12 (rounding up) days of potatoes. I’m supposed to be on a calorie restricted diet of 1800 or less per day, which is helping, but to get 1800 calories a day eating just potatoes, I’d need to consume 5 POUNDS of potatoes. That’s right, every day on this thing to hit target calorie intake I’d need 5 POUNDS!?!?!? So, with 12 days needed to be shopped, a total of 60 pounds of potatoes, I headed to Costco.</p>

<p>Here’s what my shopping chart looked like:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.adambourg.com/assets/img/potato-diet-posts/costco-potatoes.png" alt="Costco cart"></p>

<p>That’s a lot of potatoes! The berries are for my son, Luke, for him to eat with yogurt and breakfast for the next two weeks. Not pictured is the bottles of the sparkling water I got to enhance my diet this week.</p>



<p>If you don’t want to see me shirtless, it’s time to close the page. My starting stats on 11/20/2020 are: 335 LBS, but the offical, diet starting stats are: 333.4 lbs, BMI of 41.7. I’ll be updating this blog with progress, but here’s to my weightloss and success.</p>

<p>I’m off to eat more potatoes!</p>

		<div>
						<p>The NYT describes “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/magazine/free-speech.html">The Problem of Free Speech in an Age of Disinformation</a>, and in response Hacker News commenter <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24813749">throwaway13337</a> says, in part, “It’s not unchecked free speech. Instead, it’s unchecked curation by media and social media companies with the goal of engagement.” There’s some truth to the idea that social media companies have evolved to seek engagement, rather than truth, but I think the social media companies are reflecting a deeper human tendency. I wrote back to throwaway13337: “Try teaching non-elite undergrads, and particularly assignments that require some sense of epistemology, and you’ll discover that the vast majority of people have pretty poor personal epistemic hygiene—it’s not much required in most people, most of the time, in most jobs.”</p>
<p>From what I can tell, we evolved to form tribes, not to be “right:” Jonathan’s Haidt’s <a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2012/03/25/jonathan-haidts-the-righteous-mind-and-what-were-really-arguing-about/"><em>The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion</em></a> deals with this topic well and at length, and I’ve not seen any substantial rebuttals of it. We don’t naturally take to tracking the question, “How do I know what I know?” Instead, we naturally seem to want to find “facts” or ideas that support our preexisting views. In the HN comment thread, someone asked for specific examples of poor undergrad epistemic hygiene, and while I’d prefer not to get super specific for reasons of privacy, I’ve had many conversations that take the following form: “How do you know article x is accurate?” “Google told me.” “How does Google work?” “I don’t know.” “What does it take to make a claim on the Internet.” “Um. A phone, I guess?” A lot of people—maybe most—will uncritically take as fact whatever happens to be served up by Google (it’s always Google and never Duck Duck Go or Bing), and most undergrads whose work I’ve read will, again uncritically, accept clickbait sites and similar as accurate. Part of the reason for this reasoning is that undergrads’s lives are minimally affected by being wrong or incomplete about some claim done in a short assignment that’s being imposed by some annoying professor toff standing between them and their degree.</p>
<p>The gap between elite information discourse and everyday information discourse, even among college students, who may be more sophisticated than their peer equivalents, is vast—so vast that I don’t think most journalists (who mostly talk to other journalists and to experts) and to other people who work with information, data, and ideas really truly understand it. We’re all living in bubbles. I don’t think I did, either, before I saw the epistemic hygiene most undergrads practice, or don’t practice. This is not a “kids these days” rant, either: many of them have never really been taught to ask themselves, “How do I know what I know?” Many have never really learned anything about the scientific method. It’s not happening much in most non-elite schools, so where are they going to get epistemic hygiene from?</p>
<p>The United States alone has 320 million people in it. Table DP02 in the Census at data.census.gov estimates that 20.3% of the population age 25 and older has a college bachelor’s degree, and 12.8% have a graduate or professional degree. Before someone objects, let me admit that a college degree is far from a perfect proxy for epistemic hygiene or general knowledge, and some high school dropouts perform much better at cognition, meta cognition, statistical reasoning, and so forth, than do some people with graduate degrees. With that said, though, a college degree is probably a decent approximation for baseline abstract reasoning skills and epistemic hygiene.</p>
<p>Almost anyone who wants a megaphone in the form of one of the many social media platforms available now has one. The number of people motivated by questions like “What is really true, and how do I discern what is really true? How do I enable myself to get countervailing data and information into my view, or worldview, or worldviews?” is not zero, again obviously, but it’s not a huge part of the population. And many very “smart” people in an IQ sense use their intelligence to build better rationalizations, rather than to seek truth (and I may be among the rationalizers: I’m not trying to exclude myself from that category).</p>
<p>Until relatively recently, almost everyone with a media megaphone had some kind of training or interest in epistemology, even they didn’t call it “epistemology.” Editors would ask, “How do you know that?” or “Who told you that?” or that sort of thing. Professors have systems that are supposed to encourage greater-than-average epistemic hygiene (these systems were not and are not perfect, and nothing I have written so far implies that they were or are).</p>
<p>Most people don’t care about the question, “How do you know what you know?” are fairly surprised if it’s asked, implicitly or explicitly. Some people are intrigued by it but most aren’t, and view questions about sources and knowledge to be a hindrance. This is less likely to be true of people who aspire to be researchers or work in other knowledge-related professions, but that describes only a small percentage of undergraduates, particularly at non-elite schools. And the “elite schools” thing drives a lot of the media discourse around education. One of the things I like about Professor X’s book <a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2011/06/10/summary-judgement-in-the-basement-of-the-ivory-tower-confessions-of-an-accidental-academic-professor-x/"><em>In the Basement of the Ivory Tower</em></a> is how it functions as a corrective to that discourse.</p>
<p>For most people, floating a factually incorrect conspiracy theory online isn’t going to negatively affect their lives. If someone is a nurse and gives a patient a wrong medication or incorrect medication, that person is not going to be a nurse for long. If the nurse states or repeats a factually incorrect political or social idea online, particularly but not exclusively under a pseudonym, that nurse’s life likely won’t be affected. There’s no truth feedback loop. The same is true for someone working in, say, construction, or engineering, or many other fields. The person is free to state things that are factually incorrect, or incomplete, or misleading, and doing so isn’t going to have many negative consequences. Maybe it will have some positive consequences: one way to show that you’re really on team x is to state or repeat falsehoods that show you’re on team x, rather than on team “What is really true?”</p>
<p>I don’t want to get into daily political discourse, since that tends to raise defenses and elicit anger, but the last eight months have demonstrated many people’s problems with epistemology, and in a way that can have immediate, negative personal consequences—but not for everyone.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/26/who-doesnt-read-books-in-america/">Pew Research data indicate that a quarter of US adults didn’t read a book in 2018</a>; this is consistent with <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/12/24/twilight-of-the-books">other data</a> indicating that about half of US adults read zero or one books per year. Again, yes, there are surely many individuals who read other materials and have excellent epistemic hygiene, but this is a reasonable mass proxy, given the demands that reading makes on us.</p>
<p>Many people driving the (relatively) elite discourse don’t realize how many people are not only not like them, but wildly not like them, along numerous metrics. It may also be that <a href="http://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/gossip-at-scale/">we don’t know how to deal with gossip at scale</a>. Interpersonal gossip is all about personal stories, while many problems at scale are best understood through data—but the number of people deeply interested in data and data’s veracity is small. And elite discourse has some of its own possible epistemic falsehoods, or at least uncertainties, embedded within it: some of the populist rhetoric against elites is rooted in truth.</p>
<p>A surprisingly large number of freshmen don’t know the difference between fiction and nonfiction, or that novels are fiction. Not a majority, but I was surprised when I first encountered confusion around these points; I’m not any longer. I don’t think the majority of freshmen confuse fiction and nonfiction, or genres of nonfiction, but enough do for the confusion to be a noticeable pattern (modern distinctions between fiction and nonfiction only really arose, I think, during the Enlightenment and the rise of the novel in the 18th Century, although off the top of my head I don’t have a good citation for this historical point, apart perhaps from Ian Watt’s work on the novel). Maybe online systems like Twitter or Facebook allow average users to revert to an earlier mode of discourse in which the border between fiction and nonfiction is more porous, and the online systems have strong fictional components that some users don’t care to segregate.</p>
<p>We are all caught in our bubble, and the universe of people is almost unimaginably larger than the number of people in our bubble. If you got this far, you’re probably in a nerd bubble: usually, anything involving the word “epistemology” sends people to sleep or, alternately, scurrying for something like “You won’t believe what this celebrity wore/said/did” instead. Almost no one wants to consider epistemology; to do so as a hobby is rare. One person’s disinformation is another person’s teambuilding. If you think the preceding sentence is in favor of disinformation, by the way, it’s not.</p>

<p>They told me, “You have to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhThso-PE_o">this interview where Mike Tyson talks about medieval history</a>,” and so I did, and there he was at the New York Public Library in 2013 being interviewed by curator Paul Holdengräber, whose German accent strikes the American ear as both effortlessly intellectual and lightly amusing, and who would seem to have nothing in common with the face-tattooed boxer.</p>



<p><img data-attachment-id="12067" data-permalink="https://quidplura.com/2020/11/29/and-this-worlds-a-fickle-measure/screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-11-57-11-pm-copy/" data-orig-file="https://quidplurablog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-11.57.11-pm-copy.jpg" data-orig-size="1816,934" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="Screen Shot 2020-11-28 at 11.57.11 PM copy" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://quidplurablog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-11.57.11-pm-copy.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://quidplurablog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-11.57.11-pm-copy.jpg?w=863" src="https://quidplurablog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-11.57.11-pm-copy.jpg" alt=""></p>



<p>The two men do, in fact, find much to talk about. Their discussion is mesmerizing, because to most of us Mike Tyson is nothing but a face and fists, not a man who reflects aloud and at length about his inner life. Holdengräber prompts a reticent Tyson to narrate clips of his greatest moments in the ring, and newcomers to boxing will easily see why Tyson was such a sensation, but Iron Mike grows more animated when other matters arise.</p>



<p>Half an hour into the interview, Holdengräber says that their mutual friend, eccentric German filmmaker Werner Herzog, urged him to ask Tyson why he’s so fascinated by Clovis, the founder of the Merovingian Frankish dynasty, and Pepin the Short, the first Carolingian king of the Franks. Tyson’s answer, however halting, makes him come alive: </p>



<blockquote><p>I don’t know—it all comes from my insecurity from being poor, and not having enough—to be insecure, and being—yeah, that’s what it is: obscure. I never wanted to be obscure. I was born in obscurity and I never wanted to deal with that again, never wanted to be that. And they came from obscurity.</p></blockquote>



<p>Tyson then narrates a capsule history of the Frankish kings. He rambles, he doesn’t get all the details right, and his mispronunciation of names marks him as an autodidact, but it’s a shame to hear the audience laugh when Holdengräber asks, “Mike, how do you know all this shit?” Whether Tyson is mapping his own experiences onto medieval history or hearing echoes of the Franks in his troubled life, the credentialed, status-conscious audience is uncomfortable with his sincere interest in a past they find trivial.</p>



<p>Yet Tyson is the real deal, a book lover not because his peer group yaks about whichever author the <em>New York Times</em> has dubbed fame’s latest love child, but because he’s hungry for ideas, for meaning, for connections across time. He speaks with undisguised emotion about Cus D’Amato, the trainer and manager who turned him into a lethal boxer. Obsessed with Nietzsche and Clausewitz, D’Amato taught Tyson to see boxing as war and war as the key to decoding the world. “That is just what I do,” Tyson explains, an attentive pupil and dutiful son. “I love war. I love the act of war. I love the players in war, the philosophy of war.”</p>



<p>Tyson is searching for more than war on the pages of the past. Having grown up amid crime and chaos and founded his life on violence, he now relies on books to make moral and ethical sense of the world:</p>



<blockquote><p>Yeah—they’re our most priceless possessions, because if you think about it, you know, a room without a book is like a body without a soul. It’s the only way that we can connect the future with the past. Without that, there’s no way that we can know about the future, and know about particularly the past, or the present, you know, that when you think about history, the value of history is not necessarily scientific but moral. By liberating our minds and deepening our sympathies and fortifying our will, we can control—pretty much history allows us to control not society but ourselves, which is a much more important thing to do, you know what I mean? And it would allow us to pretty much meet the future more so than foretell it, and for that reason alone, in order to predict the future we always have to look through the past, because very rarely does time not repeat itself, and it always will repeat itself. </p><p>I’ve heard a quote before in a book that we would be fools to think historically that the past is us in funny clothes, but the past <em><span>is</span></em> us in funny clothes, and that’s truly what it is. That’s from somebody who really said a really profound statement but he misquoted what he was saying, he must have been saying it backwards, because that’s really what the past was, it’s just us in funny clothes, in different times, that’s really what it is.</p></blockquote>



<p>Of course, to hear Tyson cite <a href="http://thecampvs.com/2011/08/03/cicero-on-books-and-the-soul/">a quip inaccurately attributed to Cicero</a>, “a room without books is like a body without a soul,” is to wonder if he’s putting us on. Late in the interview, he jokes that if you quote books, you fool people into thinking you’re smart—but Tyson, for all his malapropisms and mispronunciations and odd mannerisms, <em>is</em> intelligent. He’s going round after round with big questions that  many of the ostensibly educated attendees at his book-talk don’t bother to ask.</p>



<p>When Holdengräber suggests that Tyson’s knowledge of history didn’t improve his behavior, Tyson calmly disagrees. He compares himself to the fictional Ben-Hur, a fellow athlete and celebrity who achieved glory but was doomed to be unfree until he set his priorities in order: “He may not have been famous again,” Tyson points out, “but he got his family, and that was his success.” </p>



<p>After listening to Mike Tyson—childhood criminal, devastating fighter, struggling alcoholic and recovering drug addict, convicted rapist, pop-culture eidolon—speak for an hour and a half, I still don’t quite know who he is. He may be the closest thing 21st-century America has to <a href="https://quidplura.com/2011/11/03/but-the-answers-you-seek-will-never-be-found-at-home/">a Robert E. Howard character</a>, a born barbarian who’s ignorant of social niceties but possesses earned wisdom that the civilization around him disdains. I don’t know whether he’s all in on his bookish pursuits or one slight away from again gnawing off someone’s ear. Whether he’s a good man or a bad man feels foolish to ask about a professional punch-thrower who reads Nietzsche, but Tyson looks like a <em>better</em> man, one who has perhaps searched harder for his humanity than the onlookers snickering from the safety of their library seats. What has their pride gained them? Tyson’s, by contrast, has brought him perspective, and with it the humility to admit that his story is still being written—and has been before.</p>

<p>Drivers who block electric vehicle chargers in Victoria will be fined under new road rules. </p>
<p>Non-electric vehicles, or electric cars that aren’t plugged in to the charger, face fines of $330.44 for “stopping in a parking area for electric-powered vehicles”. </p>
<p>The rules are designed to stop electric vehicle chargers, which are sparse in some parts of Australia, from being blocked by drivers looking for a convenient spot to park their internal-combustion vehicle. </p>
<p>Similar rules have been implemented in American states such as Colorado to prevent what’s known as ICEing. </p>

<p>Although it has brought in new rules to protect electric vehicle drivers, Victoria has also made news for <a href="https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/victoria-aiming-to-raise-30-million-per-year-from-ev-road-tax">trying to tax them</a>. </p>
<p>The state has followed <a href="https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/south-australia-plans-ev-road-user-levy-but-also-pledges-to-buy-more-electric-cars-for-its-own-fleet">South Australia</a> in committing to a&nbsp;<strong>road tax for electric vehicle</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>plug-in hybrid vehicle</strong>&nbsp;owners.</p>
<p>The tax of&nbsp;<strong>2.5 cents per kilometre</strong>&nbsp;for pure electric vehicles and&nbsp;<strong>2.0 cents per kilometre</strong>&nbsp;for plug-in hybrid vehicles was announced by the Victorian Treasurer ahead of this week’s state budget, and will come into force in July 2021.</p>
<p>An electric vehicle owner who travels&nbsp;<strong>15,000km</strong>&nbsp;per year will be charged&nbsp;<strong>$375</strong>&nbsp;on top of their annual registration fee, while plug-in hybrid owners will pay an extra&nbsp;<strong>$300</strong>&nbsp;per year.</p>
<p>Although the estimated $30 million the tax will raise annually won’t be funnelled directly into electric vehicle infrastructure, the Treasurer said $45 million will be set aside in the budget to boost take-up of hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric vehicles.</p>

<p>Chairman of the Electric Vehicle Council of Australia, Behyad Jafari, described Victoria’s tax as a “shameful abdication of Victoria’s intention to reduce emissions”.</p>
<p>South Australia’s proposed charge will include a fixed component, similar to current registration charging, and a variable charge based on distance travelled.</p>
<p>The proposal has been widely criticised, with chief executive of the peak body for carmakers in Australia, Tony Weber, describing it as “beyond belief”.</p>
<p>“We believe this charge will make South Australia the only jurisdiction in the world that actually opposes the uptake of low and zero emission vehicles,” Mr Weber added.</p>
<p>As state governments in Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales have moved to tax electric vehicle owners, the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) has positioned itself as the friendliest jurisdiction in the nation for EV buyers.</p>
<p>It recently announced an ambitious target to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/all-act-new-car-sales-to-be-zero-emissions-by-2030-under-ambitious-plan">sell only zero-emissions new vehicles</a>&nbsp;by 2030.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle</a> is an important result in physics, expressing a limit regarding the measurement of certain pairs of particles’ physical properties. In essence, it states that the uncertainty of any measurement of these pairs of properties at the same time has a lower bound. For example, if we’re measuring a particle’s position and velocity, and want to be more certain about the particle’s <em>position</em> (measure the position more precisely),
at some point we would inevitably start becoming less certain about the particle’s <em>velocity</em>, regardless of the measurement tools we use. This limitation doesn’t come from any technical
properties of how we measure those properties. Rather, it points to a loss of mathematical meaning as the measurements get “too precise”.</p>

<p>I believe a similar phenomenon exists in the world of research and development. It seems trivial, but too many times I’ve seen it forgotten (or ignored) when it was inconvenient.</p>

<p>Pick a random project management book or article, and you’ll probably see projects depicted as triangles representing the projects’ constraints in some form. Two of the primary constraints
would be equivalents of <em>time</em> and <em>result</em>: we know what we want, and we know when we want it. In practice we are usually not overly concerned with calculating confidence intervals
for those variables.</p>

<p>But the more <em>novel</em> a project (or subtask) is, the more inherent uncertainty it has. This means that if we’re trying to take on something that no-one in-house has experience with
(and we’re not consulting someone with experience), the error bars on <em>both</em> time and result should be quite large. And if we’re tackling something entirely new (as far as we can tell
from preliminary research), it’s almost meaningless to assign an expected value to both the project’s duration and the result. This is important because after a certain threshold, a change of scope is warranted: as a manager, at some point you stop framing the project as “I want X by Y”, and start framing it as one of either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“I want X and I don’t care how long it takes.”</li>
  <li>“I’m willing to give this project until Y, no matter the results.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course both of these framings are problematic from the business perspective. But the way I see it, assigning too-small error bars just to make a project’s premise feasible
business-wise is a risky endeavor at best.</p>

<p>Note that even when a project is not very novel, <a href="https://erikbern.com/2019/04/15/why-software-projects-take-longer-than-you-think-a-statistical-model.html">we are not great at making practical estimates</a>. Even when we would expect uncertainty to be controlled it comes back to bite us - all the more reason to be extra-careful of underestimating it.</p>

November 29, 2020 | https://www.tokyodev.com/2020/10/01/recruiting-in-japan/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.tokyodev.com/2020/10/01/recruiting-in-japan/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>Japan's <a href="http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail_main?id=10&amp;vm=2&amp;re=">Employment Security Act</a> requires a recruitment business to obtain a license. Failure to do so can result in imprisonment of up to a year. While I've met sleazy recruiters, sending them to prison seems a tad excessive to me. Curious about why the industry is so harshly regulated, I started digging. This took me into the seemingly dry but surprisingly interesting topic of the history of recruitment in Japan. As virtually nothing about this is written in English, I'm sharing what I found.</p>

<h2 id="japans-first-employment-agency">Japan’s first employment agency</h2>

<p>The earliest account of an employment agency in Japan comes from the mid-Seventeenth century. <a href="http://shokugyo-kyokai.or.jp/shiryou/gyouseishi/01-1.html">Keian Yamato</a> was a doctor who was sometimes asked by his patients to introduce servants or help arrange marriages. He was compensated for these introductions, and eventually this side business grew so successful that it overtook his medical practice. In 1652, he quit his job as a doctor to focus on his introduction business instead. So much so was his early fame, that early employment agencies were called “Keian” after him.</p>

<p>Keian’s agency and others got started at that point in Japanese history because the economic conditions were right for them. For an employment agency to be a viable business, there needs to be both a large supply of people seeking employment, and employers seeking labor. By mid-Seventeenth century Japan, such a market for labor was flourishing in response to a shift in Japanese society that had started with the dawn of the Edo Period, fifty years earlier.</p>

<h2 id="the-labour-market-in-the-edo-period">The labour market in the Edo Period</h2>

<p>The Edo period started in 1603 when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_Ieyasu">Ieyasu Tokugawa</a> officially assumed control of Japan. Before he came to power, for the last century and a half, Japan had been in a state of near-constant civil war, leading to much of the country struggling to recover from the ongoing conflict.</p>

<p>Ieyasu chose Edo, modern day Tokyo, to be the center of his government and country. Previous to this, the political and cultural center was located in western Japan, and Edo and the surrounding region had been economically underdeveloped. But Ieyasu enacted policies that encouraged the urbanization of Edo, transforming it from a small castle town with only one hundred houses to a bustling metropolis of over 250,000 people by 1650.</p>

<p>Not only did Ieyasu pursue urbanization of Edo, but his policies encouraged it throughout Japan. The government divided all of Japan into specific regions, granting each to a local Daimyo, a powerful feudal lord, who built their own castles surrounded by Samurai residences. This lead to a growth in the number of artisans and merchants, who in turn needed staff, creating new employment opportunities.</p>

<p>Further driving demand for labour was the government policy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankin-k%C5%8Dtai">Sankin-kōtai</a>, which required Daimyo to alternate living between their holdings and Edo on a yearly basis, in an attempt to prevent them from gaining too much power. As it was infeasible for Daimyos to relocate their entire household to Edo, this led to a demand for temporary staff.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, Edo saw a large influx of job seekers. Traditionally in Japan, the eldest son inherited everything: the family name, business, and any assets. Other children were seen as a burden, particularly for poor families. Struggling families practiced “Kuchi-berashi”, literally translated as reducing the number of mouths, where they would place their children to work elsewhere. As Edo flourished, many second sons and daughters of poor rural families journeyed there in search of employment.</p>

<p>Not only did children seek employment in Edo, but so did adults. Often these were people from farming villages who were cast out by their family, or samurai who became masterless after their leader fell in battle.</p>

<p>As these job seekers didn’t have local connections, they sought out someone who could make introductions. With the burgeoning employment market, recruiting as a profession was born in Japan.</p>

<h2 id="employment-in-the-edo-period">Employment in the Edo period</h2>

<p>Employment is a relationship where an employer pays an employee for work. While this has been one type of relationship, there are others where people perform work without receiving compensation, such as slavery or indentured servitude. In the Edo Period, the division between compensated and forced labor was ambiguous, with the term <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A5%89%E5%85%AC">Hōkō</a>, roughly translated as “service” or “apprenticeship”, used to refer to a wide range of employment-like relationships.</p>

<p>The most straightforward kind of Hōkō was temporary labor, where a person tended to be paid daily. Another form was a long term contract of a year or more to work for a samurai house. With this contract, they were usually paid on a monthly or yearly basis, however the salary itself was low as they were also provided room and board while working for the family.</p>

<p>Unpaid apprenticeships also fall under the term Hōkō, whereby a person would work for an artisan or merchant to learn the business. While they usually wouldn’t be directly paid for their work, the expectation was that their previous employer would sponsor their new business.</p>

<p>Children could also be placed out to work under a Hōkō agreement, where they would often learn a craft while being given food, clothes, and a place to live, but not be directly financially compensated. The parents of the children would be given what was effectively an interest free loan: they’d get a lump sum payment when the child started the apprenticeship, which they’d need to pay back when it ended.</p>

<p>While Hōkō tended to refer to agreements of fixed duration, it also encompasses a slavery-like relationship, whereby a whole family was born to serve a wealthy family for their entire life. Near the beginning of the Edo period, this form of permanent Hōkō was banned, and restricted to a fixed period instead (a maximum of 3 years in 1616, but extended it to 10 years in 1625).</p>

<h2 id="recruiter-or-human-trafficker">Recruiter or human trafficker?</h2>

<p>In modern parlance, just like there is a clear divide between employment and forced labour, there is also a clear divide between recruiters who perform employment matchmaking, and human traffickers who provide uncompensated labourers to employers. In the Edo period, the difference between these two professions was murkier than it is today.</p>

<p>For instance, when children ventured into Edo in search of employment and didn’t have any local connections, they would sometimes make use of a local recruiter. These recruiters would sign a contract on behalf of the parents with an employer. While some of these were benevolent, it was easy for them to be exploitative, and force the children to take jobs with poor working conditions.</p>

<p>During this period, the government also established special regions called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%ABkaku">Yukaku</a>, which became the only legal area to practice prostitution. The government saw Yukaku as a way of maintaining public order and collecting taxes. To ensure a steady stream of new prostitutes, the government allowed the “apprenticing” of young girls into prostitution. Unlike normal apprenticeships though, where the parents needed to pay back the “loan” that they received, the girl herself became responsible for paying it back. The amount the parents received was so much though, that even if the girl worked her entire life as a prostitute, she could never pay off the debt. The only way out was to have a wealthy man buy out her remaining debt, and become his mistress. Some recruiters took advantage of Yukaku, and effectively bought young girls from poor families in rural areas and sold them to brothels.</p>

<h2 id="first-steps-towards-regulation-of-recruitment">First steps towards regulation of recruitment</h2>

<p>In 1867, the Tokugawa shogunate was finally toppled, ushering in a new era in Japanese history, referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_(era)">the Meiji period</a>. Whereas the previous government had maintained an isolationist stance, the new government embraced western technology and culture, seeking to modernize the country before it was subjugated by western powers.</p>

<p>As part of this modernization, the government abolished the strict class system that divided Japanese into Samurai, peasants, artisans, and merchants, declaring that everyone who had been peasants, artisans, and merchants to be equal. People who were formerly Samurai and Daimyo however were still granted a status as nobles.</p>

<p>With this move modernity, the government sought to regulate the recruiting industry. In 1872, they introduced a requirement that recruiters be licensed and have a guarantor. They also limited the fee a recruiter could receive to be a maximum of 5% of the salary of the introduced employee. This fee was paid by both the employee and employer.</p>

<h2 id="international-attempts-to-ban-private-employment-agencies">International attempts to ban private employment agencies</h2>

<p>As part of the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I, <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/history/lang--en/index.htm">the International Labour Organization (ILO)</a> was founded to advance social and economic justice through setting international labour standards.</p>

<p>At their very first meeting in 1919, the ILO called on its members to establish free public employment agencies and move towards banning fee charging agencies. As a member of the ILO, Japan created a new law, which required municipal governments to establish public employment agencies and introduced stricter requirements for private employment agencies. While there had been 9,712 private agencies in 1926, the number dwindled to 2,541 by 1934.</p>

<p>The new regulation of the industry also saw stronger controls against unethical recruitment, such as using exaggerated or false claims to recruit people, forcing applications, recruiting women to be prostitutes, blocking applicants’ freedom, and so on.</p>

<p>In April 1938, the public employment agencies that had been operated at a local level were nationalized with a new law. This law also banned private agencies, except for some of the existing agencies, which were allowed to continue while facing even stricter regulations. Many of the private agencies who were banned merged into the national agency. The driving factor for this nationalization was not human rights though, but rather a response to a rapid increase in …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>This will be the first in a series of articles showing you how to model a public company.</p>
<p>We’re going to build a <strong>standalone model</strong> for Slack Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: WORK). A standalone model is exactly what it sounds like: a financial model for a given company without any assumed transactions (e.g., acquisition, dividend recap, etc.). Oftentimes, a standalone model is the first building block in a larger financial analysis exercise. For example, if a bank is hired to help a company review its strategic alternatives, one of the first steps is working with management to build a standalone model. The standalone model serves as the company’s <em>base case</em>, which all strategic alternatives are then compared to.</p>
<p>Likewise, public markets investors model public companies in order to project financial results and evaluate investment opportunities. For private equity investors, building a rigorously tested operating model is one of the key workstreams in any deal. Knowing how to build rock-solid standalone models is a foundational skill for investment banking, private equity, and hedge fund professionals.</p>
<p>This article will walk you through building a public market overview (PMO), which is the first step in any standalone model for a public company. A public market overview calculates a company’s equity value and enterprise value, along with basic trading multiples.</p>
<p>Future articles in this series will walk you through building the full standalone model and accompanying operating cases. This is step one.</p>
<h2 id="Getting-Started"><a href="#Getting-Started" title="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started</h2><p>We recommend you start from a blank Excel workbook and try to follow the steps below. But if you prefer, here’s the <a href="https://multipleexpansion.com/excel/Slack-PMO.xlsx">completed Excel file</a>.</p>
<h2 id="1-Create-Cover-Tab"><a href="#1-Create-Cover-Tab" title="1) Create Cover Tab"></a>1) Create Cover Tab</h2><p>First, we’re going to create a cover tab. Our cover tab looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://multipleexpansion.com/2020/11/25/standalone-model-public-market-overview/1-cover-tab.png"></p><p>A few things to point out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Below the cover area, we wrote our project code name (“WORK”) in cell F47. We’re naming this cell <code>PROJECT</code>.<blockquote>
<p>To name a cell, you press <strong>CNTL</strong> + <strong>F3</strong>. When you name a cell, you can then refer to it anywhere in the workbook using its new name (in this case, <code>PROJECT</code>).</p>
<p>Word to the wise: don’t overuse this functionality. If you have more than 10 named cells in your model, you’re doing too much.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>The title in the cover area is actually a formula using our project code name. The formula is:<blockquote>
<p>=”Project “&amp;PROJECT</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Similarly, the date / timestamp below the title is created using the formula:<blockquote>
<p>=now()</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-Create-PMO-Tab"><a href="#2-Create-PMO-Tab" title="2) Create PMO Tab"></a>2) Create PMO Tab</h2><p>Next, we’re going to create a new tab for our <strong>p</strong>ublic <strong>m</strong>arket <strong>o</strong>verview (PMO). Again, a public market overview calculates a company’s equity value, enterprise value, and implied trading multiples. This might sound simple, but calculating equity and enterprise values can involve a surprising degree of nuance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Okay, let’s create a new tab. The shortcut to create a new Excel tab is <strong>SHIFT</strong> + <strong>F11</strong>.</li>
<li>Now, let’s rename the new tab <code>PMO</code>. The shortcut to rename an Excel tab is: <strong>ALT</strong> &gt; <strong>H</strong> &gt; <strong>O</strong> &gt; <strong>R</strong>.</li>
<li>Let’s apply some basic formatting to our new tab. In the upper leftmost cell, we’ll reference the project name again.<blockquote>
<p>= “Project “&amp;PROJECT</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Below the project name, let’s put a page header - in this case, “Public Market Overview (PMO)”</li>
</ul>
<p>Your new PMO tab should look like this: </p>
<p><img src="https://multipleexpansion.com/2020/11/25/standalone-model-public-market-overview/2-blank-pmo-tab.png"></p><h2 id="3-Add-PMO-Layout"><a href="#3-Add-PMO-Layout" title="3) Add PMO Layout"></a>3) Add PMO Layout</h2><p>Let’s add the basic structure of our PMO. Remember - we’ll be calculating equity value, enterprise value, and trading multiples for Slack. </p>
<p><strong>How do we calculate equity value for a public company?</strong> Pretty simple, we multiply the number of shares by the stock price. We’ll need (i) the stock price and (ii) the fully diluted share count.</p>
<p><strong>How do we calculate enterprise value for a public company?</strong> We take the equity value, and we add net debt. We’re already calculating the equity value (above), but we’ll need to look at Slack’s latest filings in order to determine the net debt.</p>
<p><strong>How do we calculate trading multiples?</strong> (If you really have no idea, this is not the right tutorial series for you.) We’re going to divide equity value and enterprise value, respectively, by various financial metrics for Slack, such as revenue, EBITDA, and net income. The exact metrics and multiples we use will depend on the company’s financials.</p>
<p>Here’s what the outline of your PMO should look like:</p>
<p><img src="https://multipleexpansion.com/2020/11/25/standalone-model-public-market-overview/3-pmo-layout.png"></p><h3 id="Stock-Based-Compensation"><a href="#Stock-Based-Compensation" title="Stock-Based Compensation"></a>Stock-Based Compensation</h3><p>You’ll notice that we’re adding options &amp; RSUs to basic shares in order to calculate the <strong>f</strong>ully <strong>d</strong>iluted <strong>s</strong>hares <strong>o</strong>utstanding (FDSO). Most public companies offer some form of stock-based compensation to employees, and options and RSUs are two common varieties. When we go through Slack’s financial statements, we may discover additional share awards, or we may find out that Slack doesn’t have options or RSUs. Ultimately, we need the fully diluted share count, so that we can calculate accurate equity and enterprise values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Some theory - why we’re focused on counting every last share…</strong><br>A company’s stock price gives us the implied equity value per share. We must assume that the market is relatively efficient. Therefore, the market is doing the same basic math as us, and knows exactly how many outstanding shares there are, including from stock-based compensation. Armed with this knowledge, the market is then giving us a price, which implicitly is the <em>most diluted</em> (lowest) value. If we don’t include all shares in our equity value calculation, we’re undervaluing the given company, because we’re multiplying the market price (reduced by share awards) by a half-baked share count.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Noncontrolling-Interest"><a href="#Noncontrolling-Interest" title="Noncontrolling Interest"></a>Noncontrolling Interest</h3><p>Noncontrolling interest represents the portion of any subsidiaries not owned by Slack. For example, if Slack bought 80% of XYZ Co three years ago, all of XYZ Co’s assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and cash flows would be included in Slack’s consolidated financials. The outstanding 20% of XYZ Co - not owned by Slack - would be included in Slack’s balance sheet as noncontrolling interest. </p>
<p>Noncontrolling interest is included as a debt-like item in the build from equity to enterprise value. It’s treated like debt, because it represents a claim on Slack’s consolidated net operating assets that is not included in Slack’s equity value. Remember, the noncontrolling interest is the portion <strong>NOT</strong> owned by Slack and, therefore, not indirectly owned by Slack’s shareholders.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>More theory - what does enterprise value represent?</strong><br>This concept is often poorly explained. I’ll try to do a better job here. Enterprise value represents the aggregate value of a business, or collection of assets, irrespective of capital structure.</p>
<p>For example, when you buy a house, you fund the purchase using some combination of debt and down payment. The enterprise value for the house is the total amount of money transferred to the seller. Enterprise value ignores capital structure - it is purely a measure of aggregate value.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="4-Searching-the-Financials"><a href="#4-Searching-the-Financials" title="4) Searching the Financials"></a>4) Searching the Financials</h2><p>Now the fun begins. Reading and searching a company’s financials deserves its own (lengthy) article series. We’ll do our best to cover the essentials below.</p>
<h3 id="SEC-Filings"><a href="#SEC-Filings" title="SEC Filings"></a>SEC Filings</h3><p>Since we’re evaluating a US-listed company (Slack), we’ll go to the SEC’s website to pull the filings. A lot of people are intimidated by the SEC website, due to its slightly clunky interface, but once you get the hang of it, it’s fast and easy. Personally, I feel more comfortable pulling filings directly from the source - and in the US, that’s EDGAR, the SEC’s filings website.</p>
<p>I never remember the website URL, so I always just google “SEC EDGAR.” The first result is the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">correct link</a>. On the left side of the EDGAR webpage, you should see a search box labeled <strong>Company and Person Lookup</strong>. That’s where you enter the ticker. So let’s type in Slack’s ticker, <strong>WORK</strong>, and we’ll get going.</p>
<p>You should now be on Slack’s EDGAR page, and you should see “Slack Technologies, Inc.” at the top (here’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=1764925&amp;owner=exclude" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the link</a> in case you want to double-check).</p>
<p>Filings are listed in reverse chronological order (most recent filings at the top), and the number-and-letter symbols in the leftmost column represent filing types. You’ll mainly be interested in <strong>10-K</strong>s (annual financials), <strong>10-Q</strong>s (quarterly financials), and <strong>8-K</strong>s (periodic investor updates), but here’s a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/forms/edgform.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete list of filing types</a>. I wouldn’t recommend reading this list, unless you have an unanswered question. For example, if you see an unusual form code and want to know what it is, try google first. If you can’t find a succinct answer quickly, then pop open <a href="https://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/forms/edgform.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this list</a> and <strong>CNTL</strong> + <strong>F</strong>.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and 8-Ks are where you’ll spend most of your time. 10-Ks provide the most comprehensive information, and they’re filed annually. You can think of 10-Qs as leaner, less filling versions of the 10-K. 10-Qs are filed quarterly. <a href="https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answersreada10khtm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This guide on how to read a 10-K</a>, provided by the SEC, is pretty thorough without making your eyes bleed (at least mine didn’t). If you’re new to filings research, it’s a good place to start.</p>
<p>When building a PMO, you want to locate the latest 10-Q or 10-K, which should have all of the information you need. Ideally, the latest 10-Q or 10-K will be one of the first filings listed, as is the case here (as of November 25, 2020). See below:</p>
<p><img src="https://multipleexpansion.com/2020/11/25/standalone-model-public-market-overview/4-first-10-q.png"></p><p>It’s better (for you) if the latest 10-Q / 10-K is near the top of the list, because then you have to check fewer filings to ensure nothing material has changed. Remember - 8-Ks contain investor updates, so sometimes you can run into situations, in which an important 8-K is released <em>after</em> the latest 10-Q / 10-K. By default, you should check every filing above the latest 10-Q / 10-K, and it’s also a good idea to check any 8-Ks directly below the latest 10-Q / 10-K. You don’t want to miss something important. Anyways, we’re in luck. No subsequent 8-Ks, and the latest 10-Q should have everything we need.</p>
<h3 id="10-Q-and-Exhibits"><a href="#10-Q-and-Exhibits" title="10-Q and Exhibits"></a>10-Q and Exhibits</h3><p>Let’s click on that top <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764925/000176492520000570/0001764925-20-000570-index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10-Q</a>. You should see this menu:</p>
<p><img src="https://multipleexpansion.com/2020/11/25/standalone-model-public-market-overview/5-latest-10-q-menu.png"></p><p>The first link in the table (here, it says “10-Q”) is the main filing. We’ll go to that in a second.</p>
<p>The exhibits listed below the filing contain various legal documents. You can ignore these unless you’re hunting for something specific. For example, the first …</p></div></div>

                    <p>Pay up -- or we’re pulling the plug. </p><p>That’s the approach the news industry should take when it comes to Google and Facebook: Pay for our journalism or we’re banning it from your platforms. </p><p>For too long, journalists have given away their stories for free in exchange for distribution by the duopoly. At best, a story may go viral (rare) or hit the SEO lottery and experience a one-off traffic surge (unsustainable). </p><p>And for that, newsrooms have willingly handed over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/business/media/google-news-industry-antitrust.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share">billions of dollars</a> in ad revenue to the tech giants that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/03/facebooks-siren-call/">threaten</a> their very existence. (Google and Facebook are No. 1 and No. 2 <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/facebook-ad-revenue-2019-2020">ad platforms</a> in the U.S., respectively).</p><p>The news industry as a whole needs to come together and demand to be fairly compensated for their contributions. Until Facebook and Google agree to pay up, they are simply exploiting journalism under the pretext of democratizing information. </p><p>News drives habit. Habit drives frequency. And frequency drives time spent. In the attention economy (read: ad-driven), news content entices people to come back and stay in platforms’ carefully crafted ecosystems. </p><p>In short, platforms need news. </p><p>Mark Zuckerberg said it himself when Facebook launched its news tab in 2019 (its most recent olive branch to publishers). In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/opinion/sunday/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-news.html">piece for the<em> New York Times</em></a>, the Facebook founder pledged to “support the news industry” and said that journalism today is “more important than ever.” But only <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/23/facebook-offer-news-tab-users-pay-some-publishers-their-work/">some of the 200+ publishers</a> involved in the news tab were actually paid for their contributions. &nbsp;</p><p>These platforms are simply using their high-minded mission statements (e.g. Facebook: To “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together” and Google: To “organize the world’s information”) as a thuggish pretext for exploiting journalism. </p><p>Instead, they should pay a licencing fee or provide a sizable cut of ad revenue to newsrooms that are populating the platforms (Murdoch analogized this to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/22/rupert-murdoch-facebook-should-pay-news-publishers">carriage fee</a>). &nbsp;</p><p>It’s not enough for them to attempt damage control by <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/06/google-paying-publishers-is-more-about-pr-than-the-needs-of-the-news-industry/">spinning up funds</a> claiming to help journalism or offering some – but not all – publishers fees for their contributions. (If you want to know how Google really feels about paying for news, see <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/google-news/google-to-shut-down-news-site-in-spain-over-copyright-fees-idUSL1N0TV0S520141211">how they treated publishers</a> in Spain).</p><p>That’s why we’re building <a href="https://www.forthapp.com/?utm_source=nillium&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=frontpage">Forth</a>, a news-first platform that pays journalists for their work and offers the audience concise updates with context -- from the reporters they trust. All revenue generated on Forth is shared with our news partners. </p><p>We only allow trusted and credible journalists (vetted by our editorial team) to publish to the platform. It's a one-stop shop for accurate information about what's happening right now. &nbsp;</p><p>It’s one thing for Facebook and Google to out-innovate a slow-to-adapt industry -- it’s another to profit off of the same industry's work with impunity. </p><p>Newsrooms should be mad as hell -- and they don’t have to take it anymore. </p><p>Let’s Go Forth, </p><p>-- Xana</p><p><br><em>Xana O'Neill is the Co-Founder of Forth, a platform for concise updates with context from the reporters you trust.</em></p>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In the middle of an actual, like, actual workplace coup with secret meetings, purges, puppetmasters, frame-ups, leak investigations, and (rumored) slack DM surveillance, I was listening to the bombshell podcast and heard about this book about coup-proofing, and how it ruins teams.
I picked up a copy, and this year I read it.</p>

<p>The book (Caitlin Talmadge / <a href="https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501700293/the-dictators-army">The Dictator’s Army</a>) is about how coup fears hamstrung management in two wars:
Saddam Hussein’s 8-year failed invasion of Iran, and South Vietnam’s final defense against the North.
This article is about private sector leadership lessons I took from the book.</p>

<p>Writing about private sector leadership on the eve of a plausible military coup seems like peeing into the ocean, but it’s this or doomscrolling and holding in your pee can kill you.</p>

<p>Most management books are aspirational and map out success.
This one is about repeated failure, despite great funding, first-mover advantage and better equipment, through repeated mistakes, and in the public eye.
Nothing that I would know anything about cough.</p>

<p>Startups sub 30 people have a hard time accessing experienced hires who combine domain skill and the ability to work on a team.
There are real reasons for this, and some boil down to something like Saddam’s coup fears.
But if our society plans to continue airlifting cash into small companies, onboarding good middle managers earlier can make more of these bets pay off.</p>

<p>If you prefer a soundtrack, play this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thbICk05yPk">masterclass on management</a> (from GI Joe’s Cobra Commander) in the background.
It sometimes gets me through the week.</p>

<h2 id="despots-meddle">Despots meddle</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Liberty, as a principle, has no application to any state of things anterior to the time when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion.
– JS Mill</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By inference, if you’re not hiring barbarians and / or they don’t need improvement, or your team is capable of discussion, consider a lighter-weight leadership style.</p>

<p>‘Despot’ also means bronze age feudal landowners or the heir apparent of Byzantium, but we haven’t had those for a while.
Adaptive reuse of the term in revolutionary France gave the term its modern meaning:
an absolute ruler who governs without restraint by the law.
See also ‘frondeur’.</p>

<p>When growing teams take on more complex goals but don’t update their management, they encounter pathologies of delegation –
senior leadership who isn’t sure how to solve problems using middle managers, who give them the wrong length leash.
This is the 10 person to 30 person growth spurt.
Good companies outgrow it this <em>if</em> they survive.</p>

<p>Here’s what that looked like in Iraq:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>decision-making at the senior levels of the Iraqi military revolved more around the fear of what Saddam might do than what the Iranians might do.<sup id="fnref:senior-fear" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:senior-fear">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>by the middle of the war, Saddam was making a serious effort to inform himself about military matters in order to understand what was happening. However, Saddam was the only decision maker,<sup id="fnref:educate" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:educate">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Technocratic middle managers were spending most of their energy undoing their leader’s bad decisions, rather than fighting and winning.
There’s a spectrum between ‘own worst enemy’ and ‘annoying bandwidth bottleneck’, but new managers generally are on it somewhere.</p>

<p>Over-centralization of authority sends a message that people shouldn’t act on their own, which paralyzes your org.
Note that I’m not arguing against hierarchical authority or a clear chain of command, but rather against authority all concentrating at the top, making it impossible for middle managers to do their jobs.
In Vietnam:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>few officers who had come up in the Diem system were willing to do anything “in the absence of detailed orders.”<sup id="fnref:detailed" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:detailed">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Centralization also hamstrings the flexibility of a large team to adapt to new information.
Top leaders, often lacking domain skill or up-to-date information, are best at ‘do nothing without asking me’ orders that trap middle managers in bad positions.
In one case:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because Saddam had decreed that units were not allowed to cede any ground, the Iraqi defense was poorly coordinated and ineffective, eventually inducing panic.<sup id="fnref:panic" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:panic">4</a></sup> …
Iraqi officers in the field lacked the authority to redeploy forward troops or to call on reserves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And because the dictators aren’t an expert in any part of the organization, lack the attention to focus on everything at once, and aren’t accountable to anyone, they have zero memory.
In one case in Vietnam, President Thieu’s personal intervention not only disrupted the existing strategy, but he had forgotten by the next day that he’d given the order.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>sudden change in orders from an uninformed Thieu was a disaster, resulting in neither a robust defense of the city nor a clean withdrawal.<sup id="fnref:sudden-change" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sudden-change">6</a></sup> … Amazingly … Hue’s abandonment apparently came as a surprise to President Thieu<sup id="fnref:abandonment" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:abandonment">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unaccountable, illogical plans from inexpert leaders create hills to die on, in some cases literally.
They also come through unusual channels (because hands-on leaders prioritize fast action).
Unusual channels = coordination and preparation impossible for middle managers.
In one case in South Vietnam, a general:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>personally interceded at all levels, sometimes going so far as to personally issue orders by radio to individual brigade commanders without notifying the division operations center. Both Giai and his division advisers often learned of new orders only as they were being carried out.<sup id="fnref:all-levels" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:all-levels">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>By comparison, the North Vietnamese had good delegation and sane command structures in place.
From an internal document, they valued:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“unanimity of thought from the top to the bottom regarding the opportunity we faced and the tactics to be employed” but significant room for commanders to execute their plans<sup id="fnref:unanimity" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:unanimity">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the American revolution, George III was having a conversation with his American portraitist Benjamin West; he heard Washington was going to resign his commission and ‘return to his farm’.
The King was like ‘ha pull the other one’, recognizing that giving up power is very hard, and said something like ‘<em>if</em> he does it I take back everything I said about the guy.’
The point is that accepting the limits to authority is hard, but also critical for good leaders.</p>

<h2 id="managing-up">Managing up</h2>

<p>One of the lessons of 2020 is probably that sometimes the only person in the room who can stop a bad outcome is a middle manager,
and often they can only do it by managing up, not through direct action.</p>

<p>Middle managers are frequently in situations where their domain skills are better than senior leadership –
either because they’re technocrats with domain skills,
or because they’re dealing with the problem day-to-day and have better information, or both.</p>

<p>We still get shouted down a lot, resulting in waste:
of money, of time, of resources, of opportunities, of morale.
In a war it can be lives.</p>

<p>We speak out a few times but eventually converge to inaction as your <a href="https://danluu.com/wat/">wtfs trail off</a>.
We give up because we’re tired, but that’s not all of it:
We stop arguing because when a leader experiences argument as dissent, their reactions are unpredictable and poison the team.</p>

<p>The way around this way of thinking is to
(1) make very sure that you’re very right when you pick a fight with your boss,
(2) fight for better delegation, not just a correct decision this one time.
And (3) remember that if you succeed, things get permanently better; these are hard fights but companies need them to grow.</p>

<p>Middle managers are the only people who have the authority and connections to fight these fights.
That’s why they leak, that’s why they manage up.
The organization will fail if we don’t.
Employees depend on companies to put food on the table; you do have a moral obligation to help your employer not fail (if you can) (barring circumstances like if <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn1VxaMEjRU">you’ve looked at these caps recently</a>).</p>

<p>I saw a <a href="https://twitter.com/FutureDocs/status/938173926953443328">JAMA article</a> about ‘professional silence’ by doctors.
Silence is not golden when an important argument is being suppressed.</p>

<p>Senior technocrats have a surprising amount of power when they align their story and band together. For Saddam, years into the war:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Iraqi generals blamed Saddam’s military organizational practices for both sets of losses, raising a serious danger of overthrow from within<sup id="fnref:blame" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:blame">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because his leadership style was in conflict with their technical skills.
He punished losses in ways that deterred ground commanders from requesting backup, creating a losing cycle:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Saddam put great pressure on Iraqi commanders on the ground to avoid losses, which led them not to report failures. Withholding losses from reports and thus not receiving reinforcements or other support left commanders in impossible combat conditions. However, this was better than reporting their failures and suffering execution.<sup id="fnref:pressure" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:pressure">11</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The command-and-control system was incapable of transmitting the true tactical situation. Senior Iraqi officers later noted that they often got more timely information from the media than they did from their own commanders at the front.<sup id="fnref:media" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:media">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Vietnam, General Phu, a technocrat middle manager who had been brought in to fix the South Vietnamese army’s problems, tried to use his authority to salvage a bad campaign and was talked down.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Phu, who previously had enjoyed an excellent reputation as commander of the 1st Division, expressed grave reservations about the operation to those around him, complaining that he had done it only because of Thieu’s order<sup id="fnref:reservations" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:reservations">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>President Thieu’s realtime intervention, leading to a bad loss, demoralized him and he was never able to lead again:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thieu’s absurd order to withdraw immediately from the Central Highlands essentially caused another corps commander, General Phu, …</p></blockquote></div></article></div></div></div>

  </header>

  <p>When a system has been live for a long time, it’s not rare to use newer technologies to improve performance, maintainability, or add new features. One of such changes can be which database to use. This can be the most difficult kind of change. During the migration, there are two data sources, which makes it a distributed system. Make data consistent under a distributed system is very hard and can easily go wrong. In this article, we will explore a way to keep the data consistent during the migration, and maintain a low downtime at the same time.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>There are some requirements in order to use the way described in this article:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The source database support capture data change (CDC) method like MySQL bin log.</li>
  <li>The source database can be dumped with a consistent view and mark the position in data change logs.</li>
  <li>The target database support ACID transactions.</li>
  <li>Both source and target database support read and write permission control.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>

<p>There are two basic ideas behind the steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The clients only write to one of the databases at a given time. So we can avoid distributed transaction which is error prone and slow.</li>
  <li>We make the switch of database by setup the database permissions. It’s faster than switch from client code and easier to make sure to switch all the clients.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are the detailed steps:</p>

<h3 id="1-dump-the-source-database-to-target-database">1. Dump the source database to target database</h3>

<p>First, we need to dump the source database with a consistent view. And mark the position we’ve dumped. For example, in MySQL, you can use <code>mysqldump</code> with <code>--master-data</code> to dump the database with a bin log position. (<a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqldump.html#option_mysqldump_master-data">Document about the usage</a>). After we get all the data from source database, we can insert them into the target database.</p>

<p>Since this is the first step, it’s very easy to handle failure: just start again from beginning. So it’s very important to capture any error while import the dumped data.</p>

<h3 id="2-capture-changes-from-source-to-target">2. Capture changes from source to target</h3>

<p>The next step is to use the capture data changes from the source database. For example, in MySQL, you can use <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/binary-log.html">bin log</a> to capture the changes and insert them to the target database. Since we have the start position from last step, we know where to start parse and import the changes.</p>

<p>It’s very important to keep order of the changes while importing. So it’s better to use only one process to parse and import the changes. This part is challenging: the performance matters here. <strong>The time to sync all the changes is the downtime we need for migration</strong>.</p>

<p>We also need to make sure we don’t miss any changes or import any changes multiple times even there are system failures. So it’s very important to record the change log position. It’s convenience to write the position into the target database with the same transaction that imports the data. So the position will be synced with the data we imported.</p>

<h3 id="3-deny-writes-to-the-target-database-from-clients">3. Deny writes to the target database from clients</h3>

<p>The easy way to keep data consistency is to have a single source of truth. Until now, we are using the source database as the source of truth and sync changes to the target database. We don’t want to mess up the target database with other writes. So we need to setup the target database permission to deny all the writes from clients. For example, in MySQL, you can grant only <code>select</code> permission to the table for the clients and deny other operations. We allow the read permission so that we can compare the read results at the next step.</p>

<h3 id="4-modify-the-clients-to-read-and-write-both-databases">4. Modify the clients to read and write both databases</h3>

<p>The next step is to make the clients to read and write both source and target databases.</p>

<p>We want to read/write source database first. Use this result if there is no permission error, use the read/write result from target database otherwise.</p>

<p>The read/write to target database has two purposes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Before switch to the target database, we can verify the target database works as expected by compare read results and write operations. Note that the target database may have lag to sync up, so the results may not always the same. But we can have an understanding of the correctness based on the percentage of same results.</li>
  <li>After we switch to the target database, the read/write results will be used as the real results.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>If you want to make sure the target database can handle the load, it’s a good idea to allow read/write to the target database for a while .But it’s just as a verification, the data in the target database will not be consistent after that. So after we verify the target database can handle the traffic, we need to cleanup the target database and start from step 1 again.</strong> (We don’t need to modify the client code during the steps).</p>

<p>For the error handling, there are two key points:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Only use target database result if there is permission error from source database. Throw other errors from source database.</li>
  <li>Ignore errors for the target database if the result is not used but make sure to log them, so that it will not affect the current operation while also make sure we don’t have errors before the switch.</li>
</ol>

<p>The client code would be like this:</p>

<div><div>
  <div><pre><span> <a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a></span>db_operation() {
<span> <a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a></span>  try {
<span> <a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a></span>    source_result = source_db_operation()
<span> <a href="#n4" name="n4">4</a></span>  } catch (PermissionException e) {
<span> <a href="#n5" name="n5">5</a></span>    return target_db_operation()
<span> <a href="#n6" name="n6">6</a></span>  }
<span> <a href="#n7" name="n7">7</a></span>  async {
<span> <a href="#n8" name="n8">8</a></span>    // do the following things async so it will not impact the performance
<span> <a href="#n9" name="n9">9</a></span>    try {
<span><strong><a href="#n10" name="n10">10</a></strong></span>      target_result = target_db_operation()
<span><a href="#n11" name="n11">11</a></span>      compare_result(source_result, target_result)
<span><a href="#n12" name="n12">12</a></span>    } catch (Exception e) {
<span><a href="#n13" name="n13">13</a></span>      log_error(e)
<span><a href="#n14" name="n14">14</a></span>    }
<span><a href="#n15" name="n15">15</a></span>  }
<span><a href="#n16" name="n16">16</a></span>  return source_result
<span><a href="#n17" name="n17">17</a></span>}
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="5-deny-access-to-the-source-database-from-clients-and-wait-for-changes-to-by-synced">5. Deny access to the source database from clients and wait for changes to by synced</h3>

<p>After we are confident with the read and write to the target database, we can make the switch. We switch the database by change the database permissions. First, we deny all the access to the source database from clients. Then we wait for the changes to be full synced to the target database. During this time, the system is down. So how fast the changes are synced from source database to target database determines how much down time it will be.</p>

<h3 id="6-allow-write-to-target-database">6. Allow write to target database</h3>

<p>After the target database is fully synced, we can enable the target database permission for all the clients. After this, the system should be online again and the database is fully switched over.</p>

<h3 id="7-optional-fallback-to-source-database-if-anything-goes-wrong">7. Optional: Fallback to source database if anything goes wrong</h3>

<p>It’s good if everything works well so far. But that may not always the case. Maybe the target database cannot handle the new traffic (that’s why it’s important to test it in step 4). In this case, we need fallback to the source database.</p>

<p>If it’s fine to lost committed data during the migration time, it would be relatively easy to fallback:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Allow access to the source database. After this, the clients should be using the source database again.</li>
  <li>Cleanup the target database and start from the beginning.</li>
</ol>

<p>If it’s critical to save the committed data and make sure they are consistent, then before step 5, we should setup a mechanism to capture changes from target database to source database, and mark the change position after step 6. Then the fallback steps would be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Deny all the writes to target database.</li>
  <li>Sync from target database to source database (make sure to stop it after fully synced).</li>
  <li>Allow access to the source database.</li>
  <li>Cleanup the target database and start from the beginning again.</li>
</ol>

<p>The sync from target database to source database is very dangerous and hard to test, so it’s really important to test the target database can handle the operations in step 4.</p>

<h3 id="8-cleanup-client-code">8. Cleanup client code</h3>

<p>Once the database is switched to the target database, we can cleanup the code that access the source database. Then the database is fully migrated and you can enjoin it!</p>

        <section>
            <p>When I was young I owned a PlayStation 1 (PS1). It was one of the first, if not the first, game consoles I owned and it had a profound effect on my future. </p>

<p>I can trace the history of how I got involved in computers back to playing and modding video games. While I wasn't smart enough to mod game consoles when I was young, my dad wasn't bad at it. He modded my PS1 to have a little switch in the back that would allow it to play burnt games. They say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. </p>

<p>Fast-forward to today and I no longer have my original PS1. I remember some games wouldn't load anymore and I had gotten a PS2. So why keep an old console? Turns out the answer is nostalgia and memories. You miss what you don't have anymore.</p>

<p>Recently a friend gifted me a PS1. And so then the journey begins, how do I mod this thing? </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are looking for them I am selling <a href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=2&amp;pub=5575378759&amp;campid=5338273189&amp;customid=&amp;icep_item=223024408143&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg&amp;toolid=11111">flashed, prewired modchips</a>. </p>

<p>Very simply, the principles behind PS1 DRM work as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sony baked (not the technical term) strings (i.e. <code>SCEA</code>, <code>SCEI</code>, <code>SCEE</code>, or in rare cases <code>SCEW</code>) into official PS1 games in locations which cannot be replicated by a regular reader. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUwSOfQ1D3c">This video</a> and <a href="http://www.psxdev.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=128">this post</a> discuss it reasonably well.  </li>
<li>The CD drive controller looks for those strings to identify a disc as official. Once the controller decides that the disc is/isn't official, the main CPU reads this decision and acts accordingly.  </li>
<li>If the string can't be found or is garbled, the PS1 knows the disc isn't an <strong>authentic</strong> PS1 game. However, because the PS1 needs to account for disc read errors, there's a good amount of leeway in what passes the authenticity check.  </li>
<li>Because region <small>(<strong>A</strong> for America, <strong>I</strong> for Japan, <strong>E</strong> for Europe, and <strong>W</strong> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Yaroze">Net Yaroze</a>)</small> as well as authenticity are rolled into one string, Sony kills two birds with one stone here and achieves region locking as well as copy protection. </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you want a real in-depth discussion you can read <a href="http://www.oldcrows.net/mcc2.html">the original posts by The Old Crow</a> or the <a href="https://problemkaputt.de/psx-spx.htm#cdromprotectionmodchips">No$PSX documentation page</a> or this <a href="http://psx-scene.com/forums/f10/psx-modchip-faq-64110/">Modchip FAQ</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>PSX modchips work by electrically stifling the output originally generated by whatever CD is inside the drive and then injecting a new, faked signal into the CD microcontroller. This causes the PS1 to believe that whatever disc is inside is legitimate and proceed to boot up. </p>

<p>Later on Sony added more complicated checks like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Checking for the magic strings during the game instead of at boot </li>
<li>Changing the overall process to make it more difficult to bypass by simply emitting the correct strings.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, modern modchips already deal with this. Modchips that work under these updated circumstances are known as "stealth modchips" because the console shouldn't be able to detect them at all. </p>



<p>The first "open source" modchip was reverse engineered by a guy named "The Old Crow". Surprisingly, The Old Crow specializes in electronic music synthesizers, not hacking video game consoles. It's from his modchip that most other modchips are derived from in some sense. He originally reverse engineered a commercial PS1 modchip that was designed by a western engineer working for a Chinese company. </p>

<p>Today, there are three main modchips which are still used by the community today.</p>

<p>The modchips include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://quade.co/ps1-modchip-guide/mm3/">Multimode 3 (MM3)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://quade.co/ps1-modchip-guide/mayumi-v4/">Mayumi v4</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kalymos/PsNee">PSNee</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The three have their pros and cons but generally they can be summarized as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>MM3 is the most common PS1 modchip seen/used today. Its only real downside is that it uses an internal oscillator which can become out of sync with the oscillator used by the CD drive. If this happens you simply need to reboot your console to try reading again.  </p></li>
<li><p>Mayumi v4 attempts to use the oscillator used by the CD drive. This reduces the chance of the oscillator sync issue from happening; however, Mayumi v4 is considered a bit difficult to install. </p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/kalymos/PsNee">PSNee</a> is an open source modchip originally written by <a href="https://assemblergames.com/threads/psnee-a-stealth-modchip-for-all-ps1-models.57907/">TheFrietMan</a>. Development on it was <a href="http://www.psxdev.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1262">later continued by others</a> and it appears to work rather well on all Playstation 1/PSOne models. Based on the code I believe it attempts to infer where the PS1 is in the boot process to begin injecting fake <code>SCEX</code> strings. Unfortunately PSNee is complicated to install. The provided diagrams are atrocious and nowhere near as simple as the available diagrams for MM3 and Mayumi. I worked out <a href="https://gist.github.com/ColdHeat/be633b7eb6e25758ec80ae0115c1887a">the pinout for the Attiny45</a> but I ended up going with MM3 and Mayumi because it's easier. </p></li>
</ul>

</blockquote>

<p>It's generally pretty easy to make a PS1 modchip provided you have the right tools. In this tutorial we will focus on making MM3 or Mayumi v4 modchips.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While I do have an Arduino, I prefer to use the MM3 and Mayumi chips over PSNee. If you want to make a PSNee modchip, you can follow the <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Program-an-ATtiny-with-Arduino/">instructions here</a> to flash the <a href="https://github.com/kalymos/PsNee/blob/master/PsNee.ino">.ino file</a> to your Attiny. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You will need:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=PIC12F508+DIP">Microchip PIC12F508</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2tfdeP0">PICkit 3</a>
<ul><li>Also download and install <a href="http://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide">MPLAB IPE</a> from the MPLAB X IDE package. </li></ul></li>
<li>Some kind of <a href="https://amzn.to/2llKUG7">wiring &amp; breadboard</a> to connect the PIC to to the PICkit.</li>
<li>HEX codes for the modchip of your choice (provided below).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many tutorials call for the PIC12C508. This is an old model and continuing to use them is unnecessary unless you have them stockpiled. HEX codes that work for the 12C will work for the 12F. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To begin you should first look your IC and determine which leg is which. The leg nearest the imprinted circle is Pin 1. The leg opposite it is Pin 8. </p>

<p><img src="https://blog.kchung.co/content/images/2018/06/pic12f508-2.JPG" alt="This is a DIP chip. I accidentally got SOIC-8 (i.e. surface mount) and had to solder my chip to a breadboard but generally you can avoid that"></p>

<p>You can plug this into a bread board and then wire it into the Pickit according to the following diagrams. You want to match the following (the rest are unused for now):</p>

<ul>
<li>PICKit 1 ⟷ IC 4 (V<sub>PP</sub>)</li>
<li>PICKit 2 ⟷ IC 1 (V<sub>DD</sub>)</li>
<li>PICKit 3 ⟷ IC 8 (V<sub>SS</sub>)</li>
<li>PICKit 4 ⟷ IC 7 (ICSPDAT)</li>
<li>PICKit 5 ⟷ IC 6 (ICSPCLK)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://blog.kchung.co/content/images/2018/06/pickit-12f508-1.jpg" alt="PICKit 3 on the left, PIC12F508 on the right"></p>

<p>Once you've properly wired up the chip, connect the PICKit to your computer and start MPLAB IPE. Under <code>Device</code> select <code>PIC12F508</code>. </p>

<p>Go into <code>Settings &gt; Advanced Mode</code>. The default password for <code>Advanced Mode</code> is <code>microchip</code>. I don't recommend changing it, not sure why the option is even available. </p>

<p>Go into the <code>Power</code> tab on the left and enable <code>Power Target Circuit from Tool</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.kchung.co/content/images/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-20-at-8.39.15-PM.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Go back to the <code>Operate</code> tab and hit <code>Connect</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.kchung.co/content/images/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-20-at-8.40.54-PM.png" alt=""></p>

<p>From here download the appropriate HEX code for your chip and console. They are different per console region. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ColdHeat/PsNeePy/hexcodes/mm3/MM3USA.HEX">MM3 for American Consoles</a></li>
<li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ColdHeat/PsNeePy/hexcodes/mm3/MM3EUR.HEX">MM3 for European Consoles</a></li>
<li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ColdHeat/PsNeePy/hexcodes/mm3/MM3JAP.HEX">MM3 for Japanese Consoles</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can also use Mayumi v4 on the PIC12F508 if you choose.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ColdHeat/PsNeePy/hexcodes/mayumiv4/mayumi-usa4.hex">MayumiV4 for American Consoles</a></li>
<li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ColdHeat/PsNeePy/hexcodes/mayumiv4/mayumi-eu4.hex">MayumiV4 for European Consoles</a></li>
<li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ColdHeat/PsNeePy/hexcodes/mayumiv4/mayumi-jap4.hex">MayumiV4 for Japanese Consoles</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In the <code>Source</code> file, select your hex code. </p>

<p>Hit the big <code>Program</code> button. </p>

<p>You should see something similar to the following text:</p>

<pre><code>2018-06-20 20:48:02 -0400 - Loading hex file. Please wait...

<p>If you'd like, you can hit the <code>Verify</code> button to make sure that your flash was correct. Your output should look something like the following:</p>

<p>From here you can follow online diagrams for soldering your chip to the PSX that you own. I personally used <a href="https://quade.co/ps1-modchip-guide">William Quade's excellent diagrams</a> and think you should as well.   </p>



<p>While looking at all these modchips, I figured it would be nice to read and write Python code instead of Assembly and C code so I started working on porting PSNee to Python. </p>

<p>By using <a href="https://micropython.org/">MicroPython</a> and an <a href="https://amzn.to/2K4HdTq">ESP8266</a> we can actually create a modchip that we can remotely update and modify through the <a href="https://amzn.to/2K4HdTq">ESP8266</a>'s WiFi.  </p>

<p><img src="https://blog.kchung.co/content/images/2018/06/IMG_1084.jpg" alt="Effectively the very first WiFi enabled PS1!"></p>

<p>In the above photo (SCPH-7501), the ESP8266 is on the top left with the headers face up. The wires connect to the headers and route under the CD drive to a breadboard on the bottom right. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The breadboard has wires that are soldered to the correct MM3 points and then labeled with the corresponding pin number. By using this breadboard I can test modchips that I make much faster than soldering to the board over and over again. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My modchip (named PsNeePy) is available on Github: <br>
<a href="https://github.com/ColdHeat/PsNeePy">https://github.com/ColdHeat/PsNeePy</a></p>

<p>While my test console is quite bad at reading discs and the console rarely boots into games, the modchip does work. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the most part (ignoring stealth functionality), modchips are known to be working once you reach the black Playstation logo screen as this indicates that the CPU considers the game authentic. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, because the code is based off an older version of PSNee, stealth functionality does not seem to work on some newer PS1 revisions.</p>

<p>I mostly created this as a proof of concept and I'm unlikely to maintain it very much. While I don't recommend using my modchip, I hope that the community adopts it and helps improve it. Despite being a dead console, the PSX community is fairly active. </p>

<p>We made some <a href="http://www.thegraidenetwork.com/blog-all/2017/1/16/tech-accomplishments">considerable improvements to the tech stack</a> at The Graide Network during my years at the company, but one of the things I’m most proud of is our automated testing system. In this post, <strong>I’ll outline our strategy for testing microservices using layers of unit, integration, acceptance, and end-to-end tests.</strong></p>
<p>We used tests to deploy our microservices faster and with very few defects. Along the way, I’ll offer some other resources that we found helpful as we designed a robust testing system for our microservices.</p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-software-testing">The Importance of Software Testing</h2>
<p>First, why do we care about testing our software anyway?</p>
<p><img src="https://www.karllhughes.com/assets/img/cost-of-tests-over-time.png" alt="The cost of automated software tests over time"></p>
<p>While testing adds time to the software development life cycle, it <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/testing-matters">pays dividends in the long run</a>. I’m not going to harp on this topic here, but in my experience, automated tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help prevent defects from reaching production</li>
<li>Lower the risk of regressions</li>
<li>Push developers to use better architectural patterns</li>
<li>Enhance your documentation</li>
<li>Guide code reviewers</li>
<li>Make it easier to add new features later</li>
<li>Help developers debug tricky edge cases</li>
</ul>
<p>When using microservices, these factors are all important, but as you’ll see, the distributed nature of this pattern adds an extra challenge.</p>
<h2 id="our-architecture-and-testing-strategy">Our Architecture and Testing Strategy</h2>
<p>When I joined The Graide Network in the fall of 2016, there were no tests; no way to tell if something was wrong on the site; no way to catch bugs before they went into production. Needless to say, we couldn’t ship much code in the first few weeks.</p>
<p>So, we started to invest in a test suite by writing some Behat tests in <a href="http://mink.behat.org/en/latest/">Mink</a>. Our application wasn’t written to be tested, so unit tests were initially next to impossible, but behavior-driven tests gave us at least a little confidence to start refactoring to microservices.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, we’ve built out six microservices on the backend, an <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> frontend application, and made some major improvements to slim down the legacy application. At a high level, our architecture looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kQrADqw.png" alt="Our microservices architecture"></p>
<h2 id="microservice-testing-resources">Microservice Testing Resources</h2>
<p><strong>One of our biggest challenges in managing a microservice architecture is testing.</strong></p>
<p>This seems to be a common problem for architects who choose microservices; we’re far from the first company to encounter and solve this problem. One of the most helpful resources I’ve found is Martin Fowler’s <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-testing/">Testing Strategies in a Microservice Architecture</a>, which I would strongly recommend.</p>
<p>I’d also recommend picking up <a href="https://amzn.to/2K4UDQL">Microservices in Action</a> by Morgan Bruce and Paulo Pareira. While they don’t talk about testing specifically much, they do offer some tips for monitoring, tracing, and continuous delivery of your microservices.</p>
<p>Finally, take a look at <a href="https://amzn.to/2IJES1b">Susan Fowler’s Production-Ready Microservices</a>. I liked her perspective based on Uber’s massive microservice architecture as they deal with a level of scale and fault tolerance I can only imagine.</p>
<p>While all of the resources above offer great general advice, I will focus on the details of our microservices testing strategy in the remainder of this post. I hope this gives you a better handle on what this might look like in practice.</p>
<h2 id="our-layered-microservice-testing-strategy">Our Layered Microservice Testing Strategy</h2>
<p>Each of our microservices and each frontend application lives in its own repository and on its own server, so everything is highly decoupled. The great thing about this is that we can switch components out and upgrade individual APIs without taking the whole system down. The challenge with this architecture is figuring out how to test each service without standing up all the services it depends on.</p>
<p>Our testing strategy is broken down into several layers within each application and integration layers around multiple components of the application. These layers are based on the well-known <a href="https://automationpanda.com/2018/08/01/the-testing-pyramid/">testing pyramid</a> concept.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Tyryn3G.png" alt="Software testing pyramid"></p>
<h3 id="layer-1-api-tests">Layer 1: API tests</h3>
<p>Each API (or microservice) is written in <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a>, and communicates with internal APIs, external APIs, and a database over an HTTP or TCP connection. These are pretty typical PHP applications, but they return JSON responses instead of serving up user views.</p>
<p>As for testing, we use a mix of unit, integration, and acceptance tests as seen here:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/R5KyCsC.png" alt="A single microservices tests broken out by class"></p>
<h4 id="a-unit-tests">A. Unit tests</h4>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zGYeTJe.png" alt="unit tests"></p>
<p>Since we rely on a well-tested framework, we choose not to test some components which are already adequately tested in Laravel. While a lot of developers put application logic in their controllers, we keep our controllers slim and instead pass off most of the business logic to Jobs, Repositories, and Models, but pretty much every custom layer in the application is unit tested.</p>
<h4 id="b-integration-tests">B. Integration tests</h4>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uWsqseu.png" alt="integration tests"></p>
<p>Some pieces of the application lend themselves especially well to integration tests. For example, the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/eloquent">Eloquent Models</a> we write are so tightly bound to the database that it’s convenient - and more productive - to integration test them with a real database connection rather than try to mock it.</p>
<p>We keep our models slim, so our integration tests just verify that they retrieve data from the data as we would expect. For example, here’s a typical model in our Assignments API:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;?php</span> <span>namespace</span> <span>GraideNetwork\Assignments\Models</span><span>;</span>

<span>use</span> <span>GraideNetwork\Base\Models\AbstractModel</span><span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletes</span><span>;</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Inquiry</span> <span>extends</span> <span>AbstractModel</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>use</span> <span>SoftDeletes</span><span>;</span>

    <span>protected</span> <span>$dates</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>'deleted_at'</span><span>];</span>

    <span>protected</span> <span>$guarded</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
        <span>'created_at'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>'updated_at'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>'deleted_at'</span>
    <span>];</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>function</span> <span>assignment</span><span>()</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>belongsTo</span><span>(</span><span>'GraideNetwork\Assignments\Models\Assignment'</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>function</span> <span>scopeGraiderRequest</span><span>(</span><span>$query</span><span>,</span> <span>$userId</span> <span>=</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>$query</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>where</span><span>(</span><span>'type'</span><span>,</span> <span>config</span><span>(</span><span>'enums.inquiry_types.REQUEST'</span><span>))</span>
            <span>-&gt;</span><span>where</span><span>(</span><span>'graider_id'</span><span>,</span> <span>$userId</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Our integration tests for this model just need to check two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we query this model using <code>with('assignment')</code>, does it return its parent assignment?</li>
<li>If we query this model using the <code>graiderRequest($userId)</code> scope, will it find all Inquiries that are of the <code>type</code> <code>Request</code> and where the <code>graider_id</code> matches the <code>$userId</code> passed in.</li>
</ul>
<p>We try to test the unhappy cases as well (eg: if we query without the <code>with('assignment')</code> argument, it should <em>not</em> retrieve the parent assignment).</p>
<h4 id="c-acceptance-tests">C. Acceptance tests</h4>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/53jOK7E.png" alt="acceptance tests"></p>
<p>Let me make a distinction here: <strong>we call any tests that test a single microservice or frontend application “acceptance” tests, while tests that test the entire network of services and applications are called “end-to-end” tests</strong>. Your terminology may vary, but the distinction is important.</p>
<p>In order to run an acceptance test on an API, we test each microservice and its database connection <em>without</em> testing the other APIs in our system. We do this by mocking the HTTP Client at runtime and binding the mocked version of the client to Laravel’s application service provider. When we write each acceptance test, we just need to let the test know which mocked API calls will be made and what they will return. This effectively decouples our microservices for testing purposes.</p>
<h3 id="layer-2-http-client-library-tests">Layer 2: HTTP Client library tests</h3>
<p>We don’t test our internal API clients within each microservice because they are used in multiple places. So, we <a href="https://bitbucket.org/thegraidenetwork/tgn-clients">released a Composer Package</a> for our microservice HTTP clients and wrote unit and integration tests there.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/u0F1RAS.png" alt="Http client package tests"></p>
<h4 id="a-unit-tests-1">A. Unit tests</h4>
<p>The unit tests within our HTTP client package are pretty simple since our internal HTTP clients are just wrappers around <a href="http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/latest/">Guzzle</a>. They ensure that parameters are passed in, transformed, and sent Guzzle and that the expected response is passed back to the caller.</p>
<h4 id="b-integration-tests-1">B. Integration tests</h4>
<p>Our HTTP client integration tests actually make calls to the microservices. These are still a work in progress, but the idea here is that these integration tests (in addition to each API’s internal acceptance tests) will help ensure that the APIs are responding as we expect.</p>
<h3 id="layer-3-frontend-tests">Layer 3: Frontend tests</h3>
<p>We have two frontend systems: our legacy application, which sits in front of all the microservices, and our Angular frontend app, which will eventually replace the legacy application. Since we’re moving away from the legacy frontend, I’ll omit it, although we do currently unit and end-to-end test that application as well.</p>
<p>As for the Angular frontend application, the testing layers look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qEyLDWs.png" alt="Angular frontend testing layers"></p>
<h4 id="a-unit-tests-2">A. Unit tests</h4>
<p>Just like with our backend code, we unit test each sub-layer within the Angular application by mocking any dependencies (<a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/dependency-injection.html">Angular’s dependency injection makes this easy</a>) and using <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli">Angular CLI</a> to wrap the Karma tests. As with any testable code, the key is to keep components lean, but I’m admittedly still learning a lot about the best way to structure an Angular app.</p>
<h4 id="b-integration-tests-2">B. Integration tests</h4>
<p>We don’t run end-to-end tests directly within our Angular app, but we do run integration tests with mocked API responses. This ensures that the entire Angular application is transforming and presenting data as we would expect, but it allows us to avoid requiring all of our backend microservices to be running just to run the test suite.</p>
<h3 id="layer-4-end-to-end-tests">Layer 4: End-to-End tests</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZXPhKa3.png" alt="end-to-end tests"></p>
<p>While <a href="https://testing.googleblog.com/2015/04/just-say-no-to-more-end-to-end-tests.html">some developers eschew comprehensive end-to-end test suites</a>, I do find that they hold some value, especially in preventing regression when your company is small and does not have dedicated testing resources (eg: our team at the Graide Network). But, I also realize that end-to-end tests are probably the least helpful in a microservice architecture as they don’t tell you on their own where something went wrong, just that it did.</p>
<p>So rather than build an end-to-end testing suite in our code (which application would it even “live” in?), we decided to use a third-party service called <a href="https://ghostinspector.com/">Ghost Inspector</a>, which automatically runs our end-to-end test suite twice per day on our dev server. Ghost inspector lets you record tests by simply clicking around your web app, so an intern or <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/product-management-process">even a product manager</a> can create tests in a pinch. Once recorded, Ghost will run the tests automatically at a specific time (or when triggered by your CI server) and report …</p></div></article></section></div>

  <h5>September 27, 2020</h5>



  

  


  
<p>I stare at my amber terminal. Hexadecimal fills my screen and my mind has become lost in the flow of 6502 assembly, as I hand optimize the code flow.</p>
<p>I’m interupted when I recieve a message from my friend, _Maverik, he’s excited about the ground breaking CGI in Tron.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Nostalgia is a weird feeling.</strong> We can forget when things happened, and misttribute things to entirely different decades. But, I think there’s something even more interesting going on with the now-sorta-fading nostalgia for the 80’s that could be seen when 2014’s Guardian’s of the Galaxy (or Vol. 2 in 2017) or 2011’s Ready Player One book (and 2018 movie) were a huge deal. These movies aren’t just appealing to a generation of Millennials that are pissed off that the world is going to shit because of the mistakes of their parents and grandparents- they’re appealing to a generation of people that has only ever known that mess. The kids, like me, that are in the awkward spot of being told just how awful it was to watch the news on September 11th, 2001 but not actually directly rembering it.</p>
<p>So, why would we be nostalgic for a time that we were never alive for? I think it’s because we’re hopeful.</p>
<p>The 1980’s were not a better time really. The Cold War was still a thing, being publically LGBT was crazy, Chernobyl happened, Computers were still mostly 8-bit, Asbestos was still being used, and, despite the numbers declining already, cigaretts were still way more common.</p>
<p>All that aside, the was something the 80’s had that we don’t have now. I’m hesitent to call it ‘hope’ or ‘vision’, and honestly, I’m not sure there even is a good word for it. Regardless, I wasn’t even around to experiance it first hand given I wasn’t born until 1998. But, from what I’ve seen of the remnants, the parts that people try to remember- the good stuff that people drink as heavily sweetend, carbonanted nostalgia - there was an <em>atmosphere of possibility</em>. The Demo Scene was in full swing, as people pushed the 8-bit hardware of the time to it’s absolute limits. Computers were progressively being used to do more, impressive things. Culture from that era is portrayed in a way that gives you a mental image of crackin' a cold one and just enjoying life. Movies from the era- Back to The Future, Footloose, Weird Science - all told stories that were hopeful and fun and made a point of how the future is going to be better.</p>
<p>It took me a while to realize all of this, but I’m not nostalgic for the 1980’s. I’m nostalgic for the xx80’s. A time that only exists in the minds of people like me, nostalgic for something they never experienced. The next cultural revolution where we can band together under a banner of making things better. Where technological advancements have postivie cultural impact instead of negitive. Where the talk of the year isn’t about how damn partisan we are but is about the power of humanity to do amazing things. It just happens that having some sort of outlet to map that nostalgia to is helpful, and that the 1980’s that kids from that era remember is the best analogy that people of my generation have. So when I wear a shirt with Rocket Raccon or put up art of the Comodore 64, I’m not showing my admiration for those things themselves. I know the <em>real</em> 1980’s weren’t that. Instead I’m giving myself physical reminders of a place and time that only exists in my own mind and making that much more concrete my dreams for a better future.</p>
<p>Instead, for now, I’m stuck in real world. I’m in 2020 where my student loan debt is piling up, there’s a raging pandemic, and I fear that I’m watching the not-so-perfect union around me crumble. But, then I look around my room, and I see the ‘retro’ tech and art, and for a little while I feel like it might be possible that we’ll do better, that maybe I’ll live to see the xx80’s come.</p>
<p>So for those that are older than me, please don’t mistake our hope for blind romanticism or a warped-sense of nostalgia. We know. I don’t think I was born in the worng generation because I didn’t experiance the 1980’s. I’m pissed that the time I did get to experiance as a kid and that I’m living in now has been ruined by giant media conglomerates, corrupt politicians, broken social values, and people that have resigened themsevles to an attidude of “it’s going to hell anyway, so why bother?”. You got IRC, I get spyed on and manipulated by Facebook. You got real movies, I got sequels. I’m not going to pretend my generation is unique in dealing with the mistakes of the last, but instead of having hope we have record rates of suicide and depression. It’s just that it’s easier to have physical attachment and hope mentally assigned to something that’s already happened than it is to have blind faith in the future.</p>

<p>The 80s represented a time when the future had limitless potential. When everyone was excited to see what the next decade held in store. The boomers had the opportunity to realize that future, and instead of making something good and beautiful and exciting, they made sure they had the distinction of being the first –and <em>last</em>– generation to ever have that kind of opportunity. There’s so much 80s stuff right now… thinking about Stranger Things, and then stuff like I Am Not Okay With This which is like, present time with the serial numbers filed off in an “80s but make it gayer” kind of way… Even a lot of the “present day but with the numbers filed off” stuff feels like “present day but the future is open and maybe isn’t full of possibilities, but it’s not empty of it and that’s the best we can imagine”.</p>
<p>God, the future was so fucking <em>BRIGHT</em> in the 80s and I think a big part of why millennials are harder to fire up than gen Z is that we knew what life was like before and nobody knows how to process the loss of countless futures that they <em>witnessed</em> as children and young adults. We’re living with grief we can’t even begin to communicate and we’re going to live with it until we die.</p>
<p>Like, you know what’s had me fucked up for a couple weeks? I work so hard trying to live inflicting as little harm as possible on people and the environment, knowing it’s a losing battle, and come to find out that the whole plastic recycling movement was a giant fraud, that it only existed as an anaesthetic to the guilt of our parents so they’d fuel the rise of single use plastics. And because millennials on down are recycling their waste at high levels, it’s easier to drop the act rather than put in the work because society would grind to a halt without single use plastics now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The following response is from Krista Carlson, born in 1980.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, the 80’s themselves were more hopeful.  We had some problems with depression and suicide, but not like today, and the enxiety almost everyone feels today was very rare.  There was still poverty, but less pressure.  There was less crime, and more freedom.  Kids could be kids, and overall, there was a feeling of innocence about the 1980’s.  The early 1990’s was when we as a nation became teenagers.  We had boomboxes and were rebelious. We were loud and colorful. Then came the sobering reality of watching the twin towers crumble in 2001, and I think that, more than anything else, changed American culture.  We lost our security and innocence and faced a whole new era of sobering reality.  Now, we know the politicians are all corrupt.  Now, we know we live in a society that is crumbling.  Kids deal with adult problems.  I’m not sure you can put the genie back in the bottle, but I suppose it is nice to keep the bottle around to remember the days when there was still magic in the world.</p>

<p>More people are online than ever before. More people are desperate than ever before. Learn how to use that 👇</p>
<h2>Is this the right course for me?</h2>
<p>Good question. My courses are NOT for everyone. You need to be a good fit. This is the prefect course for you if you check any of the following boxes:</p>
<ol><li>You like having a business card that says <strong>I’m CEO bitch</strong></li><li>You dream of petting elephants in a Southeast asian monarchy with a questionable human rights record</li><li>doTerra didn’t work out</li><li>You have $100 to spare</li></ol>
<h2>Basics first. What is a Ponzi scheme?</h2>
<p>Say I managed to save $500 from my day job. I find 5 people who begrudgingly agree to give me $100 because I told them I can turn it into $200 in a month. I give them $200 each at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Now, I am <strong>out of savings</strong> but I have 5 people who doubled their money in a month with no hard work at all.</p>
<p>I use their story as an example to show people that my idea works. Now it’s easier to find people who pay me. I take $100 from 10 more people, wait for a month, and use the proceeds ($1,000) to give $200 each to 5 of those people.</p>
<p>Now I have a <strong>proven business model</strong>, and a good number of people who will vouch for my method. I use the proceeds from each successive group to pay the previous cohort of people.</p>
<h2>But this is a tech community. Not Wall Street.</h2>
<p>A Ponzi scheme can be used in any part of your life. Let’s see how we can use this around us today:</p>
<h3>Example 1: Sell a Course</h3>
<p>Create a twitter account and manage to get 100 followers through a combination of spamming famous people, dad jokes, and paid followers. Write this blog post and share it:</p>
<blockquote><p>How I got 100 followers in my first week with no hard work at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>Over the next week 50 people will read your tweet / post and start following you. These people are curious, and it costs them nothing to follow you. 50 followers isn’t much but you get to write another exciting post:</p>
<blockquote><p>How I increased my twitter following by 50% in less than 3 days.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now people are intrigued, and you have 500 more followers. Write another post.</p>
<blockquote><p>How I got 500 followers overnight</p></blockquote>
<p>Does it remind you of something – like a <strong>for</strong> loop? When iteration = 5, <strong>sell a course</strong> on Gumroad.</p>
<h3>Example 2: Become a Digital Nomad</h3>
<p>Quit your job in Colorado and move to Thailand because a long-haired guy and his hot girlfriend shared a beach selfie telling you how they are living the digital nomad life, and how you can do it too. Best $100 you ever spent.</p>
<p>Except, it didn’t work out (teaching English in Thailand only pays so much), and now you’re stuck in Koh Samui running out of money and ideas. Go to the nearest beach, take a picture of your laptop with sunset in the background and write this blog post:</p>
<blockquote><p>How quitting my 9-5 job and moving to Thailand was the best thing I ever did.</p></blockquote>
<p>Congrats, now people are listening. Create a course, somehow manage to make $1,000. Now use that $1,000 to buy some food, rent a moped, and share more selfies about your perfect life. It’s a massive market – these regular folks working boring jobs in rich white countries who believe in the good intentions of strangers on the internet. Exploit them.</p>
<h3>Example 3: No Code, Only Money</h3>
<p>Aren’t you sick of all these I’m-so-smart programmers with their statically-typed-languages-are-fast on HackerNews? When you came across this priceless <strong>No Code</strong> directory of tools you realized it was the next big thing. You spend $100 on the site, and use the knowledge to create a form (using a form builder) and a Zapier hook that emails people on new responses. Genius idea. You try to sell it for $500. No buyers. It’s all your fault.</p>
<p>Time to pivot. You create a <strong>No Code</strong> website to teach people how to make money using No Code tools (like you did, haha) such as <strong>Airtable</strong> and <strong>Zapier</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Note: the lesson here is NOT that you can make money by creating a valuable tool like Airtable using code. No.</em></p>
<p>Between your <strong>No Code website</strong> and <strong>No Code podcast</strong> you manage to make $500. You take a screenshot of your Stripe dashboard and share it with the world. Now you are hot shit. Going from 0 to $500 was the hard bit; going from $500 to $5,000 is easier.</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h4>Are places like Indiehacker and Gumroad and just enablers of Ponzi schemes?</h4>
<p>Of course not. There are some amazing people there working on cool new ideas. They write comments here and there, and make a post once in a while, but mostly it’s busy work building something. Most such communities are started by a group of well-intentioned people, who slowly become the minority.</p>
<p>Not all courses are scams. I bought one on Gumroad yesterday. Except it wasn’t teaching me how to grow my twitter following; it was teaching me a cool programming language that I’ve been meaning to learn for a while.</p>
<h4>Will I be sharing fake milestones and fake Stripe dashboards?</h4>
<p>You didn’t read anything, did you? No, you will actually get 500 new followers, and actually make $5,000. The ones who won’t are the suckers who buy your course.</p>
<h4>Won’t people call me out when they buy my course and fail to become rich?</h4>
<p>That is the best part – they will blame <strong>themselves</strong>. You made money. The people who gave you Twitter testimonials apparently made money. If people fail they will think it’s them. In fact, sell them your <strong>Advanced Course</strong>.</p>
<h4>How do I convince people I am legit?</h4>
<p>Tell people you are open to <strong>speaking engagements</strong>. Talk about the number of <strong>trees you planted</strong> this month. Tell them someone else forced you to post on IH or HN because of how great your content is. Talk about <strong>failure</strong> so you seem relatable. Act <strong>quirky</strong> on Twitter.</p>
<h4>Wait, are you writing this just to make me a part of your Ponzi scheme?</h4>
<p>Do you really think I am going to spend half a Sunday writing and formatting this long-ass post (instead of using my magic formula to make money for myself) for any reason other than the goodness of my heart?</p>
<p>Of course not. I swear. I just want to share my success with the world, help the little guy, Build in Public™, like every other ‘How I Made $5,000’ post. Pinky promise.</p>
<h4>I am sold. So, how DO I run a Ponzi scheme?</h4>
<p>You see, my goal in sharing my success here is to see <strong>YOU grow</strong>. Just like the guy who sold me into his Ponzi scheme – I am only paying it forward 🙏🏼.</p>
<p>I do like to charge <strong>$100</strong> JUST to ensure that only serious people become a part of my Ponzi-family. We call it an investment.</p>

November 29, 2020 | https://harporoeder.com/posts/haskell-runtime/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://harporoeder.com/posts/haskell-runtime/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This post is substantially directed to non Haskellers. Haskell frequently appears on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news">hackernews</a>, or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/">/r/programming</a> but the content is commonly evangelizing some aspect of functional programming, strong types, and purity.</p>
<p>Haskell embodies all those things, but the practicality does not come from strongly typed functional programming. Other strongly typed functional languages such as <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a> exist, but many aspects are <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore">not nearly as mature</a>. Here I explore some of the lesser talked about features that greatly contribute to the Haskells power, performance, and convenience.</p>
<p>Numerous Haskell implementation exist (<a href="https://github.com/IntelLabs/flrc">FLRC</a>, <a href="https://github.com/UU-ComputerScience/uhc">UHC</a>, <a href="http://repetae.net/computer/jhc/">JHC</a>) however we will specifically go over <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a> which is by far the most used, and powerful.</p>
<h2 id="asynchronous-exceptions">Asynchronous exceptions</h2>
<p>In almost all languages exceptions are thrown by the executing thread. In <a href="https://www.cplusplus.com/">C++</a> throwing an exception would look something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>void</span> <span>doAction</span>() {
    <span>if</span> (<span>1</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span>) {
        <span>throw</span> std<span>::</span>runtime_error(<span>"the impossible happened"</span>);
    }
}

<span>try</span> {
    doAction();
} <span>catch</span> (<span>const</span> std<span>::</span>exception<span>&amp;</span> err) {
    cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> err.what() <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
}
</code></pre></div><p>In Haskell <em>any</em> thread can throw an exception to another thread. Let’s spawn a thread and then immediately kill it by throwing an exception from outside of it. No modification of the thread or function itself is required.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>threadId</span> <span>&lt;-</span> forkIO myLongRunningAction
<span>throwTo</span> threadId <span>MyException</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This capability ends of being incredibly powerful. All of the sudden features that might normally be implemented as fundamental properties of the language can now be expressed within it.</p>
<p>An example of this is <code>timeout :: Int -&gt; IO a -&gt; IO (Maybe a)</code>. Timeout takes a timeout in microseconds, an action to run, and may or may not return a result depending on if the action completes in time. Internally it spawns a thread with a timer, and should a deadline be hit issues an exception to the other threads computation.</p>
<p>In a language like <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> a goroutine cannot be killed externally. A common pattern emerges where authors manually wait on channels to ensure can be controlled:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>stop</span> <span>:=</span> make(<span>chan</span> <span>bool</span>)

<span>go</span> <span>func</span>() {
    <span>for</span> {
        <span>select</span> {
        <span>case</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>stop</span>:
            <span>return</span>
        }
    }
}()

<span>stop</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>true</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Should a mistake be made resources will leak, and more complicated control flows must be continually duplicated. Even killing a thread utilizing owned resources such as sockets is safe in Haskell because of constructs built on <code>bracket</code> that automatically cleanup resources.</p>
<h2 id="automatic-detection-of-failure-cases">Automatic detection of failure cases</h2>
<p><a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/04/10/Fearless-Concurrency.html">Fearless concurrency</a> is hard. Language features to make screwing up harder <a href="https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-06-19-linear-types-merged/">are in the works</a>. While Haskell will not stop you from deadlocking your program, the runtime has tooling to detect when this happens and throw an exception such as <code>BlockedIndefinitelyOnMVar</code> in the deadlocked code.</p>
<p>Haskell is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation">lazy</a> so while less common, if an unproductive infinite loop is detected a <code>NonTermination</code> exception may be thrown. This is however <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">not perfect</a>.</p>
<p>Haskell has <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?TailCallOptimization">tail call optimization</a> limiting required stack size however a recoverable <code>StackOverflow</code> can be thrown. Various arithmetic exceptions exist for numeric errors such as <code>Overflow</code>, or <code>DivideByZero</code>.</p>
<p>Each thread can have independently set allocation limits via <code>setAllocationCounter</code> which causes an <code>AllocationLimitExceeded</code> exception. This can be useful for handling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy">multitenancy</a>.</p>
<h2 id="green-threads-and-asynchronous-networking">Green threads and asynchronous networking</h2>
<p>Most languages have some implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads">green threads</a>, but few have it as the primary mode of computation. The success of <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, and <a href="https://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a> for writing networked applications is heavily tied to this model of concurrency. Languages such as <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> that implement the functionality as a <a href="https://tokio.rs/">library</a>, have <a href="http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">substantial ergonomics implications</a>.</p>
<p>Standard POSIX <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pthreads.7.html">pthreads</a> consume substantially more resources than green threads, and utilize the operating systems scheduler. On my system:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">&gt; ulimit -a | grep stack
stack size <span>(</span>kbytes, -s<span>)</span> <span>8192</span>
</code></pre></div><p>the default thread stack size as 8 megabytes. Technically Linux does lazy allocation via virtual memory, however even <em>spawning and killing</em> a thread can take <a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2020/01/30/cost-of-a-thread-in-c-under-linux/">thousands of CPU cycles</a>.</p>
<p>Scaling to a large number of concurrent users (generally known as the <a href="http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html">C10K problem</a>), is usually accomplished via asynchronous IO operations. Asynchronous IO multiplexing combined with a low level of parallelism is how services such as <a href="https://nginx.org/">NGINX</a> attain such high performance.</p>
<p>GHC internally utilizes <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html">epoll</a>, or <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=kqueue&amp;sektion=2">kqueue</a> depending on platform. And support for the new <a href="https://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf">io_uring</a> Linux API is being <a href="http://wjwh.eu/posts/2020-07-26-haskell-iouring-manager.html">experimented with already</a>, which can bring <a href="https://thenewstack.io/how-io_uring-and-ebpf-will-revolutionize-programming-in-linux/">substantial performance gains</a>.</p>
<p>Of green thread implementations Haskells is among the most powerful. For example with <code>threadStatus :: ThreadId -&gt; IO ThreadStatus</code> you can inspect the status of a thread, and if blocked even see <em>why</em>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>BlockReason</span>
  <span>=</span> <span>BlockedOnMVar</span>
        <span>-- ^blocked on 'MVar'</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>BlockedOnBlackHole</span>
        <span>-- ^blocked on a computation in progress by another thread</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>BlockedOnException</span>
        <span>-- ^blocked in 'throwTo'</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>BlockedOnSTM</span>
        <span>-- ^blocked in 'retry' in an STM transaction</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>BlockedOnForeignCall</span>
        <span>-- ^currently in a foreign call</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>BlockedOnOther</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="performance-tuning-and-gc">Performance tuning and GC</h2>
<p>Some languages such as Java are famous for the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/gctuning/introduction-garbage-collection-tuning.htm">tuning capabilities</a>. A garbage collector cannot be perfect for every workload. There exist <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/garbage-collection/garbage-collection-optimization-high-throughput-and-low-latency-java-applications">throughput and latency trade offs</a> among others.</p>
<p>By default a generational copying collector is used by the runtime. GHC has a wide variety of <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/runtime_control.html">flags to flip, and knobs to turn</a>. One of particular interest is <code>--numa</code> to enable optimizations for high core count multi CPU servers which have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access">higher communication overhead</a>.</p>

<p>Haskell has a full range of tooling to support debugging and building complex applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code coverage reporting via <a href="https://ku-fpg.github.io/software/hpc/">HCP</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2015/04/ghc-prof-flamegraph/">Time profiling flamegraphs</a> via <a href="https://github.com/fpco/ghc-prof-flamegraph">ghc-prof-flamegraph</a></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p>How many of our greatest minds have we lost?</p>
<p>From The Dream Machine (p50) on John Atanasoff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>He was determined to build a computing machine… But with all his teaching responsibilities, he’d had very little time to focus on the problem.</strong> Finally, however, on a bitterly cold winter night in late 1937, he just couldn’t take it anymore; he had to get away to concentrate. So he jumped into his car in Ames, Iowa, and drove east through the subzero temperature at more than eighty miles per hour. Almost three hours later, after he crossed the Mississippi River into Illinois, he stopped at a roadhouse to warm up. And there, somewhere between his first and second bourbons, he conceived four crucial ideas to make him computer work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Incredible! Atanasoff was busy, but finally got down to doing the thing he really loved, the world recognized his genius, and he was given all the resources he needed to complete his work.</p>
<p>At least, that’s what would have happened in any reasonable society. Instead, we’re told:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Atanasoff didn’t develop his invention any further, as it happened. Soon after the United States entered the war, in December 1941, he went to the Naval Ordinance Laboratory in Washington, D.C., where he supervised the counting testing of mines. <strong>He never returned to computing.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who knows what else he could have given us? Instead, his entire lifetime produces one brief period of real scientific producitivity, bookended by teaching responsibilities and war.</p>
<p>Once you start looking, these stories are everwhere. Here’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Unix">The Daemon, the Gnu and the Penguin</a> on the invention of Unix:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In August 1969, Ken Thompson’s wife Bonnie took their year-old son on a trip to California to show off to their families. As a temporary bachelor, Ken had time to work. “I allocated a week each to the operating system, the shell, the editor and the assembler [he told me]… and during the month she was gone, it was totally rewritten in a form that looked like an operating system”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe this is a greatly exaggerated myth, but how terrifying would it be if that was true? Is it possible that Thompson was burdened by responsibilities his entire life, and then in a brief moment of freedom did some of the most important work anyone has ever done?</p>
<p>And then from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers#Wilbur">Wikipedia</a>, on Wilbur Wright:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…Wilbur never flew again. He gradually became occupied with business matters for the Wright Company and dealing with different lawsuits. Upon dealing with the patent lawsuits, which had put great strain on both brothers, Wilbur had written in a letter to a French friend, “<strong>When we think what we might have accomplished if we had been able to devote this time to experiments, we feel very sad</strong>, but it is always easier to deal with things than with men, and no one can direct his life entirely as he would choose.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But why on earth not? Why couldn’t Wilbur Wright, now admired as one of history’s greatest investors, find time to continue his most important work? The story continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wilbur spent the next year before his death traveling, where he spent a full six months in Europe attending to various business and legal matters… He was also constantly back and forth between New York, Washington and Dayton. All of the stresses were taking a toll on Wilbur physically. Orville would remark that he would “come home white”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then finally:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After returning to Dayton in early May 1912, worn down in mind and body, he fell ill again and was diagnosed with typhoid fever. He lingered on, his symptoms relapsing and remitting for many days. Wilbur died, at age 45, at the Wright family home on May 30.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These were some of the most brilliant minds we had, and they were each nearly unable to fulfil even a tiny fraction of their potential. We should ask how much more each of them could have accomplished, but also how much we’ve lost from would-be inventors unable to find even a month of genuine free time with which to pursue their dreams. And of course, how many have been effectively barred from research by poverty or discrimination.</p>
<p>What hits me hardest is not the material loss, but the squandering of human spirit. As <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vimeo.com/115154289">Bret Victor once explained</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We recognize that a dog has to be allowed the full free expression of its entire range of capabilities. Sticking him in a cage or constraining his range of experience, you’re not letting him do all the things that dogs can do. And this is exactly what we’ve done to ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so the stories above strike me not even as tragedies, but as something more inhumane.</p>
<p>My greatest fear is that intelligent life will arrive on earth. It won’t be an invasion, or colonization, or anything horrible. They’ll just sit us down, and ask about the lives of our heroes.</p>
<p>We’ll proudly tell them about this guy Wilbur Wright. How he and his brother invented a machine to fly in the sky as gods. We’ll tell them about our culture of research and innovation, and how Wilbur, self-taught engineer from Ohio, changed the entire world.</p>
<p>And then we’ll have to explain how gruesomely we murdered him.</p>
<p>Not with sticks and stones, but with a barrage of patent lawsuits. We will have to tell the aliens how we used this great system of socially legitimate torture to slowly wear him down over the years.</p>
<p>We will tell them how in the end, poor brilliant Wilbur became old and tired and incapable of producing anything beautiful ever again.</p>
<p>I do not think they will forgive us. I am not sure we should forgive ourselves.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>See Also</strong><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://guzey.com/patronage-and-research-labs/">Reviving Patronage and Revolutionary Industrial Research</a></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Yes, I understand that Wilbur also sued people. I’m not claiming that he was a good person. My point is that in a humane world, no part of this story would even be possible.</em></p>

    <p>Overview</p>
    <p><a href="https://grpc.io/" target="_blank"><span>gRPC</span></a> is a distributed, heterogeneous, high
        performance, high throughput, modern, open source, remote procedure call (<span>RPC</span>) framework from
        Google with the following features:</p>
    <div id="para-div">
      <ul id="blue-ol">
        <li>
          <p>Is platform neutral</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Is language neutral with official support for <span>C++</span>, <span>C#</span>,
            <span>Go</span>, <span>Java</span>, <span>JavaScript</span>, <span>
            Python</span>, <span>Ruby</span>, etc</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Uses <a href="https://www.polarsparc.com/xhtml/Protobuf3.html" target="_blank"><span>ProtoBuf</span></a>
            for defining message formats and service interfaces</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Leverages <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2" target="_blank"><span>HTTP/2</span></a> for
            efficient network communication</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Provides support for both synchronous and asynchronous styles of communication</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Has pluggable support for load balancing, health checking, and authentication</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>In short, with <span>gRPC</span>, services deployed on distributed systems can communicate with each other in
        an efficient and secure manner.</p>
    <p>The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of <span>gRPC</span> (along with some circled
        number annotations):</p>
    <div id="img-outer-div"> <p><img src="https://www.polarsparc.com/xhtml/images/grpc-01.png" alt="gRPC Architecture"></p><p>Figure-1</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>The circled number annotations indicate the steps to implement, build, and deploy a <span>gRPC</span> based
        service and are as follows:</p>
    <div id="para-div">
      <ol id="blue-ol">
        <li>
          <p>Create a <span>.proto</span> file with the definitions for the request message <span>
            Req</span>, the response message <span>Res</span>, and the service interface <span>
            Service</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Compile the <span>.proto</span> file to generate the <span>gRPC</span> code for the server
            <span>gRPC Server</span> and the <span>gRPC</span> code for the client <span>
            gRPC Stub</span> for the chosen language</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Extend the <span>gRPC Server</span> code to implement and build the server side or the service provider</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Extend the <span>gRPC Stub</span> code to implement and build the cide side or the service consumer</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <p>We will demonstrate <span>gRPC</span> using the <span>Go</span> and the <span>
        Java 11</span> programming languages.</p>
    <p>Installation and Setup</p>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>The installation is on a <span>Ubuntu 20.04 LTS</span> based Linux desktop.</p>
      <p>We will also assume that the logged in user-id is <span>alice</span> with the home directory located at
        <span>/home/alice</span>.</p>
      <p>We need to install the packages for the <span>Go</span> programming language called <span>
        golang</span>, the <span>Java 11</span> programming language called <span>openjdk-11-jdk</span>,
        the <span>Maven</span> build management tool for Java called <span>maven</span>, and the
        protobuf compiler called <span>protobuf-compiler</span> from the Ubuntu repository.</p>
    </div>
    <p>To install the mentioned packages, execute the following commands:</p>
    <div id="cmd-div">
      <p>$ sudo apt-get update</p>
      <p>$ sudo apt-get install golang openjdk-11-jdk maven protobuf-compiler -y</p>
    </div>
    <p>For the Go language, we will create a directory called <span>go</span> under the home directory of the
        logged in user and set the <span>GOPATH</span> environment variable by executing the following commands:</p>
    <div id="cmd-div">
      <p>$ cd $HOME</p>
      <p>$ mkdir go</p>
      <p>$ export GOPATH=$HOME/go</p>
    </div>
    <p>To setup the directory structure and Go dependencies for the demonstrations, execute the following commands:</p>
    <div id="cmd-div">
      <p>$ cd $GOPATH</p>
      <p>$ mkdir -p src/polarsparc.com/grpc</p>
      <p>$ cd $GOPATH/src/polarsparc.com/grpc</p>
      <p>$ go mod init polarsparc.com/grpc</p>
      <p>$ GO111MODULE=on go get -u google.golang.org/grpc</p>
      <p>$ GO111MODULE=on go get github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go</p>
    </div>
    <p>To setup the Java directory structure for the demonstrations, execute the following commands:</p>
    <div id="cmd-div">
      <p>$ cd $HOME</p>
      <p>$ mkdir -p java/grpc</p>
      <p>$ cd $HOME/java/grpc</p>
      <p>$ mkdir -p src/main/java src/main/proto src/test/java target</p>
      <p>$ mkdir -p src/main/java/com/polarsparc src/test/java/com/polarsparc</p>
    </div>
    <p>For the Java language, we will leverage Maven to manage the build as well as the package dependencies.</p>

    <p>Hands-on with gRPC</p>
    <p>One of the prerequisites for <span>gRPC</span> is have a fundamental understanding of
        <a href="https://www.polarsparc.com/xhtml/Protobuf3.html" target="_blank"><span>Protocol Buffers</span></a>.</p>
    <p><span>gRPC</span> supports four types of communication patterns which are as follows:</p>
    <div id="para-div">
      <ul id="blue-ol">
        <li>
          <p><span>Unary</span> :: the client sends a single request to the server and the server responds with a
            single response</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>Server Streaming</span> :: the client sends a single request to the server and the server
            responds with a sequence of responses</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>Client Streaming</span> :: the client sends a sequence of requests to the server and the server
            responds with a single response</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>Bidirectional Streaming</span> :: the client sends a sequence of requests to the server and the
            server with a sequence of responses (with the requests and responses operating independently)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Unary RPC</p>
    <p>The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of <span>Unary</span> communication pattern:</p>
    <div id="img-outer-div"> <p><img src="https://www.polarsparc.com/xhtml/images/grpc-02.png" alt="Unary Architecture"></p><p>Figure-2</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>For the Unary RPC demonstration, we will implement a simple Greet service, where the client sends a name in the request and
        the server responds back with an appropriate greeting message based on the time of the day.</p>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>We will first demonstrate the Greet service using the Go programming language.</p>
      <p>In the <span>$GOPATH</span> directory, create the project directory hierarchy by executing the following
        commands:</p>
    </div>
    <div id="cmd-div">
      <p>$ cd $GOPATH/src/polarsparc.com/grpc</p>
      <p>$ mkdir -p unary unary/greetpb unary/server unary/client</p>
    </div>
    <p>The following are the contents of the file <span>greet.proto</span> located in the directory <span>
        $GOPATH/src/polarsparc.com/grpc/unary/greetpb</span> as shown below:</p>
    <fieldset id="sc-fieldset">
      <legend>greet.proto</legend>
      <pre>/*
    @Author: Bhaskar S
    @Blog:   https://www.polarsparc.com
    @Date:   28 Nov 2020
*/

syntax = "proto3";

package unary;

option go_package = "polarsparc.com/grpc/unary/greetpb";

message GreetRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

message GreetResponse {
  string message = 1;
}

service GreetService {
  rpc greet(GreetRequest) returns (GreetResponse);
}</pre>
    </fieldset>
    <p>The request message is defined as <span>GreetRequest</span> and the response message is defined as
        <span>GreetResponse</span>. The service interface is defined as <span>GreetService</span>
        with an RPC method <span>greet</span> that takes in a <span>GreetRequest</span> as an input
        and returns a <span>GreetResponse</span>.</p>
    <p>To compile the <span>greet.proto</span> file, execute the following commands:</p>
    <div id="cmd-div">
      <p>$ cd $GOPATH/src/polarsparc.com/grpc/unary</p>
      <p>$ protoc greetpb/greet.proto --go_out=plugins=grpc:$GOPATH/src</p>
    </div>
    <p>On success, this will generate the Go code file called <span>greet.pb.go</span> located in the directory
        <span>$GOPATH/src/polarsparc.com/grpc/unary/greetpb</span>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>We're pleased to announce the release of Elasticsearch 7.10.0, based on Apache Lucene 8.7.0. Version 7.10 is the latest stable release of Elasticsearch and is now available for deployment via <a href="https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/service">Elasticsearch Service</a> on <a href="https://www.elastic.co/cloud">Elastic Cloud</a> or via <a href="https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch">download</a> for use in your own environment(s).

To learn more about these updates&nbsp;you might consider giving our main<a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-elastic-7-10-0-searchable-snapshots-lens-user-experience-monitoring"> Elastic 7.10 release</a> blog a read.
</p><h2>Store more and spend less with searchable snapshots</h2><p>Data is growing at an exponential rate across many organizations. This is especially true for time series data like logs, metrics, traces, and security events used to observe and protect your systems. In time-series data, the most recent data ingested into Elasticsearch is what's valuable. This data drives alerting, machine learning detection, devops workflows, and monitoring security events. But keeping all of this data on high-performance instances can become very expensive if not economically feasible.
</p><p>To address this, we began looking at the lifecycle of data. Using features like <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-stack-6-6-0-released">index lifecycle management</a> helped move data from high-performance, high-cost <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/data-tiers.html">“hot” nodes to lower cost “warm” nodes</a> with less performant disks. But what if your organization asked you to keep years of data? Could you answer the question of how many unique visitors visited your site year over year on Cyber Monday? Or how many systems a user accessed over a 5 year period for a security forensic investigation? To keep this much data on warm nodes still requires a significant financial investment. This has prompted many organizations to store some data as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/snapshots-take-snapshot.html">snapshots</a>. This isn't a perfect solution, as you still need to take the time to restore the data from a snapshot whenever you need to search.
</p><p>Introducing... <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/searchable-snapshots.html">searchable snapshots</a>, a new beta feature which allows you to directly search your snapshots without a restore, on low cost object stores such as AWS S3, Microsoft Azure Storage, or Google Cloud Storage without a significant impact to search performance. Balance the cost, performance and capabilities to meet your storage and search needs.&nbsp;

The cold tier, also in beta, is designed to dramatically reduce storage costs for your read-only data by reducing your cluster storage by up to 50% without a significant impact to performance. It maintains the same level of reliability and redundancy as your hot and warm tiers, with full support for the automatic recovery you have come to expect from Elasticsearch.

</p><h2>Bolstering Elasticsearch's security chops with EQL</h2><p>In 7.9, we <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-elasticsearch-7-9-0">announced</a> Event Query Language (EQL), a new experimental query language. <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/eql-search-api.html">EQL</a>&nbsp;has been used for years within Endgame to help you get a holistic view of a system for threat investigation, identification, and prevention. These same unique capabilities used within the security space have now been brought to Elasticsearch, and in 7.10, EQL in Elasticsearch is now in beta for use cases such as observability and other time-series data.
</p><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt7b3c6e098bd9c247/5fa9b95342256d5ffdf419bd/eql-final.gif" data-sys-asset-uid="blt7b3c6e098bd9c247" alt="eql-final.gif"></p><p>A great way to understand EQL is to consider a home security analogy. Entering the house through any doorway to the home is not considered suspicious even if it's late at night. However, a person entering the house from the front door and from the back door at the same time raises questions because it would be impossible to be in two places at once. It may also be suspicious if someone enters the house after failing to use 90 different keys to open the front door in under a minute &lt;wink&gt;.
</p><p>EQL is designed to easily take an event (front door opening) and correlate other events or sequence of events (entering through the back door or window, forced entry, etc), to draw conclusions on the state of the system. These events can be correlated over a span of time to find new insights such as 90 previously failed attempts before gaining entry to the home. You can read an introduction to EQL&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-event-query-language">here</a>.
</p><h2>Elasticsearch 7.10 will be smaller, in a big way</h2><p>Our initial benchmarks have reported space reductions of up to 10% using a new stored field compression! This is big news, especially for organizations paying for storing and maintaining petabytes of data. Indices created by our <a href="https://www.elastic.co/observability">Elastic Observability</a> and <a href="https://www.elastic.co/security">Elastic Security</a> solutions will see the greatest savings due to the repetitive nature of the data they typically hold.

In <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-7-8-0-released">7.8</a>, we reduced aggregation memory consumption by maintaining serialized results, and in <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-elasticsearch-7-9-0">7.9</a> we increased the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/search-settings.html#search-settings-max-buckets">search.max_buckets</a> limit to 65,535. The Elasticsearch team has continued this work in 7.10, specifically targeting the coordinator node and the request-level circuit breaker to improve performance and memory tracking of <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/search-aggregations-metrics-cardinality-aggregation.html">cardinality</a> and <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/search-aggregations-bucket.html">bucket aggregation</a>. <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/search-aggregations-bucket-datehistogram-aggregation.html">Date histogram aggregation</a> performance has also been improved by 50% by precomputing date ranges.
</p><h2>Elasticsearch functional and usability enhancements&nbsp;</h2><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt94e1cb58b5fbb532/5fa9b9ef42256d5ffdf419c9/quote-heraclitus-no-person-ever-steps-in-the-same-river-twice.png" data-sys-asset-uid="blt94e1cb58b5fbb532" alt="quote-heraclitus-no-person-ever-steps-in-the-same-river-twice.png"></p><h3>Point in time reader</h3><p>No person ever steps in the same river twice, since it's not the same river and it's not the same person... unless you have <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/point-in-time-api.html">point in time reader</a>. When querying an index in Elasticsearch, you are essentially searching for data at a given point of time. If your query returns the top 10% results, how do you query the other 90%? With an index that is constantly changing as in most observability and security use cases, sending another query will return a different result because the index or data has already changed. Point in time reader gives you the ability to repeatedly query an index at the state it was at at a given point in time. The point in time reader already serves the EQL query language, and we expect to use it for many other use cases in the future.<br></p><h3>Case insensitivity in wildcard field type</h3><p>In Elasticsearch 7.9 we introduced the new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/keyword.html#wildcard-field-type">wildcard field type</a>. Before the introduction of this new field type, using wildcards within your query was resource intensive and typically resulted in slower than expected search times despite the learned human behavior of how we search on web browsers. The wildcard field type provides additional flexibility and an easy way to assemble queries. In 7.10,&nbsp; support for case insensitivity queries have been added. This enables case insensitivity by default for term-level queries (such as term, terms, prefix, wildcard and regexp), simply by setting the optional case_insensitive flag to true. This should greatly benefit security and observability use cases.
</p><h3>Unsigned 64 bits integer</h3><p>The time for <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/number.html#number">64 bit integers</a> is now! Elasticsearch now supports unsigned 64 bit integers. This new numeric type supports very large positive integers from 0 to 264-1. This is particularly useful for system-generated data, such as counters from routers or Windows registry events. Note that aggregations will still work on the nearest double. This is great news if you work with finance, security and network performance data.
</p><h3>Version data type</h3><p>How can you search across software versions where the numeric value is semantic? <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/version.html">Version datatype</a> is a specialization of the keyword field to handle software version values and to support specialized precedence rules for them based on semantic versioning. For example, major, minor, and patch versions are sorted numerically (“2.1.0” &lt; “2.4.1” &lt; “2.11.2”), and pre-release versions are sorted before releases (“1.0.0-alpha &lt; “1.0.0”).
</p><h3>New aggregations</h3><p>In addition to the aggregations we added in <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-7-8-0-released">7.8</a>, we are introducing two new aggregations! Histograms: <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/search-aggregations-metrics-max-aggregation.html#search-aggregations-metrics-max-aggregation-histogram-fields">min/max aggregations on histogram fields</a>, and hard bounds for histogram aggregations. The histogram datatype is useful for handling high volume numeric data, which is frequently aggregated where it is produced, allowing for a more space-efficient Elasticsearch index. For example, Elastic APM could roll up histogram data or sum it up in one structure to reduce the amount of data being sent from the APM agent into Elasticsearch. Being able to aggregate on the histogram enables supports new scenarios.
</p><p>The 2nd aggregation is <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch///reference/master/search-aggregations-metrics-rate-aggregation.html">rate metrics aggregation</a>, which is used inside a date_histogram and calculates the rate of occurrences of a specified field within a bucket of a date_histogram aggregation. Previously, it was harder to calculate the rate, but since rate is a basic piece of information when analyzing time series data, we thought it would be valuable to make it easier. This is one of many such adaptations we are making to verify that it is easy and intuitive to use the Elasticsearch generic search and analytics engine on time series data.

            <p>VANCOUVER -- 
	The empty homes tax in Vancouver will more than double next year, the city announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>
	Council voted in favour of increasing the tax from 1.25 per cent to three per cent for 2021. The current rate still applies for 2020 declarations, which are due by Feb. 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	"I'm so glad that council backed my plan to stand up for renters and raise the empty homes tax to three per cent," said Mayor Kennedy Stewart in a news release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	"This groundbreaking tool has helped move thousands of homes back onto the rental market to help house our neighbours, but there are still too many homes that remain empty."</p>
<p>
	When the tax was first introduced in 2017, it started at one per cent. Then council voted to increase it for the first time in 2019, to 1.25 per cent.</p>
<p>
	"By tripling the tax from one to three per cent since the tax launched, we're sending an even stronger message that homes are for people, not speculation," Stewart said.</p>
<p>
	According to the city, $61.3 million in net revenues from the tax has been used to support affordable housing initiatives. Vacant property has decreased by 25 per cent since the tax was introduced in 2017, the city says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SPACE COMMUNICATION</h3>
<p>
<br>
<span color="red">INTRODUCTION</span>
</p><p>
To be useful satellites and spacecraft must communicate, sometimes to relay communications between two points, sometimes to transmit data they have collected.  Although there have been some experiments in optical communications using lasers, most satellite communication is accomplished by radio, one part of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Radio frequencies must be shared with terrestrial radio services, and international frequency assignment is essential to avoid interference between all the different uses made of the radio spectrum.
</p><p>
The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) is the global body that assigns radio frequency allocations.  In doing this they divide the world into three regions, regions I, II and III.  Australian lies in region III.  The general frequency assignments may be found at the <a href="http://www.itu.int/">ITU</a> web site, and Australian allocations may be seen at the <a href="http://www.acma.gov.au/">ACMA</a> web site.  The ITU unfortunately, charges horrendous prices for any of its publications.  However, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) makes all spectral allocation information available for free download.  This includes a book, an attractive wall poster and a simplified spectrum graphic.
</p><p>
This note discusses the frequencies that are used for space communications.
</p><p><br>
<span color="red">THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM</span>
</p><p>
There are four, and only four known forces in the universe (although the so-called dark energy hints at another).  These are, in order of strength, the nuclear strong force, the electromagnetic force, the nuclear weak force and the gravitational force.  The two nuclear forces exert their influence over only very very short (nuclear) distances, and apart from holding all matter together do not directly influence us in everyday life.  It is gravity and particularly electromagnetism that are of direct concern to us in our daily interactions.
</p><p>
<img alt="Electromagnetic fields" src="https://www.spaceacademy.net.au/spacelink/emgen.gif">
Gravity springs from the property of matter we call mass, while electromagnetic effects derive from the property we call charge.  When a charge is stationary, it has around it an electrostatic field.  If it moves with a constant velocity it
produces a magnetic field, and when it accelerates or declerates it generates electromagnetic radiation.
</p><p>
Electromagnetic radiation is a coupled oscillation of electric and magnetic fields that propagates through space with a velocity of about 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> metres per second.  The properties of this electromagnetic radiation vary markedly depending on the frequency of the oscillation.  This gives rise to what we know as the electromagnetic spectrum.
</p><p>
The chart below shows the major divisions of the electromagnetic spectrum. An electromagnetic wave may be characterised by its frequency f (the number of times per second the signal undergoes a complete oscillation at a specified point in space) or its wavelength λ (the distance between successive extremal values of the wave at a specified time).
</p><center>
<img alt="EM radiation bands" src="https://www.spaceacademy.net.au/spacelink/emspec.gif">
</center>
<p><small>
Note:</small></p><ul><small>
1  For clarity the bands are not shown with uniform frequency or wavelength spacing<br>
2  The visible spectrum occupies only a very small part of the total EM spectrum<br>
3  Bands also have subdivisions (this is particularly true of the radio spectrum)<br>
4  The band divisions are not as sharp as shown, but rather fuzzy, merging into one another<br>
5  In the frequency scale T=10<sup>12</sup>, P=10<sup>15</sup>, E=10<sup>18</sup><br>
6  In the wavelength scale μ=10<sup>-6</sup>, n=10<sup>-9</sup>, p=10<sup>-12</sup>
</small></ul>
<p>
<br>
<span color="red">THE RADIO SPECTRUM</span>
</p><p>
The radio spectrum is a subset of the electromagnetic spectrum.  It extends from frequencies below 1 Hz up to around 3000 GHz or 3 THz, where it gives way to the infrared spectrum.  Different frequencies have different uses because of different propagation, generation and general properties. The radio spectrum is divided into many different bands.
</p><p>
<img alt="Radio spectral bands" src="https://www.spaceacademy.net.au/spacelink/radiospec.gif">
This table shows the usually accepted division of the radio spectrum.  The left hand column lists the frequency (f), the centre column the band designator and the right column the wavelength (λ).  The relationship between frequency and wavelength is given by the expression:
</p><ul> f = c / λ</ul>
where c = 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> metres per second is the speed of light (and other EM radiation) in free space.
<p>In the above relation, frequency is given in Hertz (Hz) when wavelength is specified in metres (m).
</p><p>
Note that the designated band qualifiers are not in the same order going toward lower frequencies as they are going toward higher frequencies.  Also note that the division between ELF and ULF is not universally agreed.  It can be placed anywhere from 1 Hz to 100 Hz.  The one shown (1 Hz) is that employed by geophysicists.
</p><p>
There is no lower limit to the ULF band and magnetic signals with periods of years can be identified.
</p><p>
Microwave is a term that was historically applied to signals with wavelengths less than one foot (30 cm), and this region has been subdivided into letter bands.  However, there are several schemes of designation for microwave bands.  Two of these, which we shall call traditional and new, are given below.  Despite the efforts of many engineers to have the 'new' division adopted, the 'traditional' scheme seems to be firmly entrenched among space communicators.
</p><center>
<img alt="Microwave sub-bands" src="https://www.spaceacademy.net.au/spacelink/uwavebands.gif">
</center><p>
<br><span color="red">WINDOWS TO SPACE</span>
</p><p>
Not all of the electromagnetic spectrum can pass through the Earth's atmosphere.  Obviously, visible light can - we can see the stars at night, at least when there is no cloud.  However, ultraviolet and higher frequencies are mostly absorbed by different components of the atmosphere.
</p><p>
There are in fact only two main windows of the EM spectrum that are open to space.  One is the visible spectrum, as mentioned above, and the other is the radio spectrum.  However, not all of the radio spectrum is useable for space communication.  The available window spans from about 30 MHz to 30 GHz, although these are not absolute end frequencies.
</p><p>
Below 30 MHz, the ionosphere, at altitudes from around 100 to 500 km, absorbs and reflects signals.  Above 30 GHz, the lower atmosphere or troposphere, below 10 km, absorbs radio signals due to oxygen and water vapour.  Even between 20 and 30 GHz, there are some absorption bands that must be avoided.
</p><center><img alt="Atmospheric windows" src="https://www.spaceacademy.net.au/spacelink/atwin.gif"></center>
<p>
<br><span color="red">HISTORICAL SPACE FREQUENCIES</span>
</p><p>
The first satellite to orbit the Earth was Sputnik 1, launched by the Soviets in October 1957.  It carried two radio beacons on frequencies of 20.005 and 40.01  MHz.
</p><p>
The Soviets continued to use frequencies around 20 MHz and even some around 15 MHz for many subsequent missions.
</p><p>
The first satellite launched by the USA (Explorer 1) carried  beacons on 108.00 and 108.03 MHz.  This lay just above the terrestrial FM broadcast band (from 88 to 108 MHz) and just inside the civil aviation band which extends from 108 to 136 MHz.  This frequency had been specified by an international committee for the International Geophysical Year (IGY - 1957/8) as the one to be used for all scientific satellites launched in pursuit of IGY objectives.  The Soviets had chosen to ignore this recommendation and use the much lower frequencies previously mentioned.
</p><p>
<br><span color="red">SPACE COMMUNICATION BANDS</span>
</p><p>
The following is a list of some of the more heavily used frequency bands for space communication. Specific frequencies may be found in the links provided at the end of this note.
</p><ul type="square">
  <li>VHF Band<br>
	<ul type="disc"><li><span color="blue">136 - 138 	MHz</span><br>
	This band was used heavily by many different types of
	satellites in the past.  Today (2012), most activity
	is restricted to 137-138 MHz (which is the current
	allocation) and consists of meteorological satellites
	transmitting data and low resolution images, together
	with low data rate mobile satellite downlinks (eg 
	Orbcomm)</li></ul>
	<ul type="disc"><li><span color="blue">144 - 146 		MHz</span><br>
	One of the most popular bands for amateur satellite
	activity.  Most of the links are found in the upper 	half of the band (145 - 146 MHz). </li></ul>
	<ul type="disc"><li><span color="blue">148 - 
	150 MHz</span><br>
	This tends to be used for uplinks of the satellites
	that downlink in the 137 - 138 MHz band. </li></ul>
	<ul type="disc"><li><span color="blue">149.95 - 	
	150.05 MHz</span><br>
	This is used by satellites providing positioning, time
	and frequency services, by ionospheric research 
	and other satellites.  Before the advent of GPS it was
        home to large constellations of US and Russian 
	satellites that provided positioning information 
	(mainly to marine vessels) by use of the Doppler
	effect).  Many satellites transmitting on this band 
	also transmit a signal on 400 MHz.</li></ul>
	<ul type="disc"><li><span color="blue">240 - 270 MHz
	 </span><br>
	Military satellites, communications.  This band lies 
	in the wider frequency allocation (225 - 380 MHz)    	assigned for military aviation.</li></ul>
   </li><li>UHF Band</li>
	<ul type="disc"><li><span color="blue">399.9 - 403 MHz
	</span><br>
	This band includes navigation, positioning, time
	and frequency standard, mobile communication, and
	meteorological satellites.  Around 400 MHz is a 
	companion band for satellites transmitting on 150 MHz. 	</li></ul>
	<ul type="disc"><li><span color="blue">432 - 438 MHz
	</span><br>
	This range includes a popular amateur satellite band
	as well as a few Earth resources satellites.
	</li></ul>
	<ul type="disc"><li><span color="blue">460 - 470 MHz   	</span><br>
	Meteorological and environmental satellites, includes
	uplink frequencies for remote environmental data
	sensors.</li></ul>
   <li>L Band<br>
	<ul type="disc"><li><span color="blue">1.2 - 1.8 GHz   	</span><br>
	This frequency range includes a very diverse range
	of satellites and encompasses many sub-allocations.
	This range includes the GPS and other GNSS (Global
	Navigation Satellite Systems - Russian Glonass,
	European Galileo, Chinese Beidou).  It also hosts
	SARSAT/COSPAS search and rescue satellites which are
	carried on board US and Russian meteorological 
	satellites. It also includes a mobile satellite
	communication band.</li></ul>
	<ul type="disc"><li><span color="blue">1.67 - 1.71 GHz
	</span><br>
	This is one of the primary bands for high resolution
	meteorological satellite downlinks of data and
	imagery.  </li></ul>
   </li><li>S Band<br>
	<ul type="disc"><li><span color="blue">2.025 - 2.3 GHz   	</span><br>
	Space operations and research, including 'deep space'
	links from beyond Earth orbit.  This encompasses the

	spacecraft, and which was also used by the Apollo
	lunar missions.  It also includes military space links
	including the US Defense Meteorological Satellite 
	Program (DMSP).  Many Earth resources (remote sensing)
	satellites downlink in this band.</li></ul>

<h2 id="s1">What is Supervisor Mode?</h2>



<p>My original OS Blog (see here: <a href="https://osblog.stephenmarz.com/">https://osblog.stephenmarz.com</a>) ran the operating system in RISC-V’s <em>machine mode</em>, which is the most privileged mode in the RISC-V architecture. It has access to all control and status registers, runs in physical memory only, and has no restrictions placed upon it by the CPU.</p>



<p>I recently ran across the OpenSBI (Open Supervisor Binary Interface), listed on Github here: <a href="https://github.com/riscv/opensbi">https://github.com/riscv/opensbi</a>. It’s been around a little while, but it seeks to be an interface between the operating system and the machine–the low-level system. </p>



<p>Currently, OpenSBI has a legacy interface that abstracts the UART device for you, as well as a HART (hardware thread–RISC-V’s name for a CPU core) management system–start a hart at a given address, stop a hart, get the status of a hart, etc.</p>



<p>The supervisor mode, known as S mode in RISC-V, is two layers below Machine mode, as shown in the RISC-V specification below. This means that our operating system uses the OpenSBI set of utilities for very low level things, in which the OpenSBI abstracts away. This makes designing an operating system for the myriad of boards a bit easier.</p>

<p>Why run the operating system at S mode? Well, whereas a high-level language as the application binary interface, or ABI, the operating system can rely on a certain set of utilities given by a RISC-V “bios” for a lack of a better term.</p>



<p>This allows our operating system to abstract much of the machine architecture away. Instead of relying on the actual system’s specification, we can program the operating system using more or less the RISC-V specification only.</p>



<p>To understand what’s going on, let’s take a look at the user level. This is where applications live. Whenever a user application runs afoul of the “rules”, such as dereferencing an invalid memory location or executing an illegal instruction, the CPU will trap to the machine mode, unless the trap is delegated lower. Luckily for us, OpenSBI delegates user traps to the supervisor mode, so our operating system can handle it.</p>



<p>Now, let’s move up one level. What happens when the operating system runs afoul of the rules? In most respects, the system crashes. An illegal instruction in machine mode will trap into machine mode. This can potentially cause a loop of traps in machine mode, as one compounds another.</p>



<p>So, as U-mode is to S-mode, S-mode is to M-mode, meaning that if the operating system runs at S-mode and messes with the CPU, then the OpenSBI will handle the trap. Usually, this means trying to load the hart into a stable, known state.</p>

<h2 id="s3">Complications while in Supervisor Mode</h2>



<p>I wrote my operating system in machine mode to make it easier to understand the RISC-V architecture. Now, switching to S-mode has complicated some things. One of the major issues I have found is that the hart’s unique id is in the <em>mhartid</em> register. That little <em>m</em> in front of it means that it is a machine-mode register. Since we’re at a lower level, we’re not allowed to access any of the machine mode registers. If we try, we will get an <em>illegal instruction</em>.</p>



<p>This means that we have to keep track of our own core id. This makes context switching and putting applications on a different core slightly more complicated. We can’t just read the mhartid register and know our hart id. Instead, we have to follow the OpenSBI interface. This is easier said than done!</p>



<p>Now that we don’t have access to any of the machine mode registers, we have to use the supervisor levels. Luckily, RISC-V gives us “views” of the same register with an s in front of it. For example, mstatus becomes sstatus. The neat thing is that if we write to sstatus, the machine-only bits are masked, and we can only set the supervisor bits. This means we can’t switch ourselves into machine mode while in supervisor mode by simply setting the mstatus bits (bits 12 and 11).</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1-1024x202.png" alt="" width="512" height="101" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1-1024x202.png 1024w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1-300x59.png 300w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1-768x152.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1-1536x303.png 1536w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1.png 1997w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"><figcaption>Machine Status Register Bits</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The sstatus register is the exact same register as the mstatus register, but when we make writes to it, the CPU will not change any machine-only bits. This is called a “view” of the machine status register. Here’s the supervisor status register. Take note of the machine bits that are masked.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-1024x238.png" alt="" width="512" height="119" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-1024x238.png 1024w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-300x70.png 300w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-768x178.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-1536x356.png 1536w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2.png 1603w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"><figcaption>Supervisor Status Register Bits</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Notice that bits 12 and 11 (Machine Previous Privilege Mode [MPP]) are WPRI, which stands for Write-Preserve, Read-Ignore. Write-preserve means that if we write to bits 12 and 11, it will preserve their original value, which essentially prevents us from writing to MPP in supervisor mode. Read-ignore means that if we try to read bits 12 and 11, we won’t get the actual data. Instead, it ignores the data and usually will give us 0.</p>



<p>This changes the way we switch from supervisor mode into user mode. So, if we put 1 into SPP (bit 8 of sstatus), then when we execute the <em>sret</em> (supervisor return), then this bit will become the privilege level. Recall that level 1 is supervisor mode. If we put 0 in bit 8, then after an sret, we will be in user mode. Recall that user mode is level 0.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="s4">Complications with Interrupts</h2>



<p>Interrupts trigger a pin on the CPU to cause a trap. This is usually in response to something, such as a timer, a software interrupt, or an external, platform-level interrupt, such as a keyboard input or wifi notification.</p>



<p>The interrupts I’m concerned about are at the platform level. RISC-V has a specification for the platform-level interrupt controller, or PLIC. In this, we can configure the PLIC to trap in supervisor mode or even in machine mode. Since the PLIC is directly connected to the CPU, we, at supervisor mode, can tell the PLIC where to send interrupts. This makes our job a little bit harder since there are many different configurations of multiple-harts, different hart configurations and so on.</p>



<p>To demonstrate this, here’s the memory map of the PLIC on a 5-hart CPU where the 0-hart only has M mode, and harts 1, 2, 3, and 4 have both M and S mode.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-4-1024x869.png" alt="" width="512" height="435" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-4-1024x869.png 1024w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-4-300x255.png 300w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-4-768x652.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-4-1536x1303.png 1536w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-4.png 1630w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"><figcaption>FU540 PLIC Memory Map</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As you can see, our stride isn’t the same for every hart, so we will have to configure our operating system nearly at machine-level. If you take a look at the <em>virt</em> cpu in QEMU (see <a href="https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/master/include/hw/riscv/virt.h#L73">qemu/virt.h at master · qemu/qemu (github.com)</a>). So, I can’t go off of just configuring each hart to enable an interrupt, I have to specify the mode where I want the interrupt to be trapped. Furthermore, each hart is not necessarily the same, as you can see with the diagram above. the FU540 has hart 0 (called the “monitor core”) to supervise the other cores, which runs in machine mode only.</p>



<p>Traps also require us to context switch, by saving the current set of registers into the context running on the hart, scheduling the next context, and loading that context onto the hart. This was fairly simple in machine mode for one reason–the MMU is turned off automatically in machine mode. This is not the case in supervisor mode. Furthermore, the MMU register, called supervisor address translation and protection (SATP), is immediate. Meaning, if I set the mode, the MMU immediately turns on. This can be a problem because I have to juggle certain registers. Take a look at the trap handler written in RISC-V assembly below.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-6-1024x654.png" alt="" width="512" height="327" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-6-1024x654.png 1024w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-6-300x192.png 300w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-6-768x490.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-6-1536x981.png 1536w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-6.png 1563w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"><figcaption>Supervisor Address Translation and Protection Register Handler</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><em>(Updated screenshot): I originally had sstatus instead of sscratch. The point of csrrw is to make an atomic swap of sscratch into t6 and the old value of t6 into sscratch. This allows us to keep both values.</em> <em>As a side note, this is actually the second time I’ve done this. My typing fingers just like sstatus better than sscratch.</em></p>



<p>As you can see, we have to be careful not destroy a register in our context. I usually use the t6 register since it is register number 31, which is the last register for an ascending loop. In the code above, I’m making sure that no memory accesses are made after the SATP register is written to. Remember, it’s immediate. As soon as I write to the SATP register and set the mode, it is up and running since we’re in supervisor mode.</p>



<p>This leads us to a little bit of a problem. Unless we map this handler, it will not be able to execute–and we still need to get to <code data-enlighter-language="asm">sret</code>. Recall that X (execute) is one of our bits and so is the U (user) bit. So, how do we handle this? We will see in the next post. Stay tuned.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="s5">Conclusion</h2>



<p>I’m still working on migrating my machine-mode operating system into a supervisor-mode operating system. This is a work in progress, so I encourage you to keep up to date on this blog!</p>



<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

            <p>The rheumatoid arthritis drug baricitinib can block viral entry and reduce mortality in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, according to translational research by an international team coordinated by researchers from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden. The findings, published in the journal Science Advances, support the continuation of ongoing randomized clinical trials.</p>

            <p>“We are pleased to report a 71 percent reduction in mortality for the group receiving baricitinib in addition to standard care,” says <a href="https://staff.ki.se/people/vollau">Volker Lauschke</a>, corresponding author and associate professor of personalized medicine and drug development at the <a href="https://ki.se/en/fyfa/department-of-physiology-and-pharmacology">Department of Physiology and Pharmacology</a>, Karolinska Institutet. “These results are especially encouraging seeing as the study included a large cohort of elderly patients, a group that is often excluded in other trials.”</p>

<p>In the study, 83 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia in Italy and Spain were treated with baricitinib in addition to standard care. Of these, 17 percent suffered an adverse outcome that resulted in death or invasive mechanical ventilation. This compared to 35 percent in the matched control group of 83 patients who received standard care only. The patients had a median age of 81 years.</p>

<h2>Well tolerated</h2>

<p>The drug was generally well tolerated with a reduction in inflammation from the first treatment days, according to the researchers. Previously reported side-effects of long-term baricitinib use, including coagulopathy and thrombosis, were not evident in any of the patients, possibly due to treatment with anti-coagulating medicine. However, some adverse events including bacterial infections and gastrointestinal and cardiovascular complications were noted, although these were also observed in the control group so it is unclear what, if anything, can be ascribed to baricitinib.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://news.ki.se/rheumatoid-arthritis-drug-shows-promise-against-covid-19-study-finds">prior study</a>, the same team of researchers reported how they used artificial intelligence (AI) to identify baricitinib as a promising repurposing candidate for COVID-19. That study also showed how the drug inhibited inflammation and reduced the viral load of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<h2>3D mini livers</h2>

<p>In the current study, the researchers elaborated on those findings by demonstrating that interferons, cytokines made and released by host cells in response to viruses, significantly increases the expression of the ACE2 receptor, which acts as an entry point for SARS-CoV-2 into human cells. While liver injury is commonly observed in severe COVID-19, mechanisms and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infections had not been investigated in this organ.</p>

<p>By combining 3D mini organs of human liver cells, RNA sequencing and super-resolution microscopy, the scientists were able to show that barcitinib reversed ACE2 gene expression changes triggered by interferons and reduced SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Interestingly, interferons did not have the same effect on the ACE2 receptor in lung organoids, suggesting that these signaling proteins affect pulmonary and liver organs differently.</p>

<h2>Dual actions</h2>

            <p>“Our findings explain the dual anti-cytokine and anti-viral actions of baricitinib and support further evaluation in randomized control trials,” says <a href="https://staff.ki.se/people/alimir">Ali Mirazimi</a>, adjunct professor at the <a href="https://ki.se/en/labmed/department-of-laboratory-medicine">Department of Laboratory Medicine</a>, Karolinska Institutet, and co-author of the study.</p>

<p>The researchers note that a limitation of the study was the lack of a placebo control group, which is included in industry-sponsored randomized controlled trials that are currently ongoing.</p>

<p>The clinical study was led by researchers at Imperial College London, U.K., Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Albacete, Spain, and the University of Pisa, Italy, while the mechanistic investigations on 3D human tissue models were conducted at Karolinska Institutet.</p>

If&nbsp;we had to consciously process and deliberate all the survival-critical sensory inputs and motor decisions like we do moves in a game of chess, we would have probably been selected out of the gene pool by Darwinian evolution. Evolution has optimized our biology to perform sensorimotor skills in a&nbsp;split second and make it feel easy.&nbsp;</p><p>Another way to appreciate this complexity is to adjust your daily life&nbsp;to a major motor disability, like losing fingers or trying to get around San Francisco without legs.</p><p><b>Software for General Robots</b></p><p>The difficulty of&nbsp;sensorimotor&nbsp;problems is especially apparent to people who work in robotics and get their hands dirty with the messiness of "the real world". What are the consequences of an irredeemably complex reality on how we build software abstractions for controlling robots?&nbsp;</p><p>One of my pet peeves is when people who do not have sufficient respect for Moravec's Paradox propose a programming model where high-level robotic tasks ("make me dinner") can be divided into sequential or parallel computations with clearly defined logical boundaries: wash rice, de-frost meat, get the plates, set the table, etc. These sub-tasks can be in turn broken down further. When a task cannot be decomposed further because there are too many edge cases for conventional software to handle ("does the image contain a cat?"), we can attempt to invoke a Machine Learning model as "magic software" for that capability.</p><p>This way of thinking - symbolic logic that calls upon ML code - arises from engineers who are used to clinging to the tidiness of <a href="https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35">Software 1.0 abstractions</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/">programming tutorials</a>&nbsp;that use cooking analogies.&nbsp;</p><p>Do you have any idea how much intelligence goes into a task like "fetching me a snack", at the very lowest levels of motor skill? Allow me to illustrate. I recorded a short video of me opening a package of dates and annotated it with all the motor sub-tasks I performed in the process.</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b1lysnGFpqI" width="501" youtube-src-id="b1lysnGFpqI"></iframe></p><p>In the span of 36 seconds, I counted about 14 motor and cognitive skills.

In the last decade or so, multiple research labs have used deep learning to develop robotic systems that can perform any-object robotic grasping from vision. Grasping is an important problem because in order to manipulate objects, one must usually first grasp them. It took the Google Robotics and X teams&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/842965756326639856/6885150399029037702#">2-3 years</a>&nbsp;to develop our own system, QT-Opt. This was a huge research achievement because it was a general method that worked on pretty much any object and, in principle, could be used to learn other tasks.&nbsp;</p></div><p>Some people think that this capability to pick up objects can be wrapped in a simple programmatic API and then used to bootstrap us to human-level manipulation. After all, hard problems are just composed of simpler problems, right?&nbsp;</p></div><p>I don't think it's quite so simple. The high-level API call&nbsp;"<span>pick_up_object()</span>" implies a clear semantic boundary between when the robot grasping begins and when it ends. If you re-watch the above video above, how many times do I perform a grasp? It's not clear to me at all where you would slot those function calls. Here is&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/1GLHrf4PcBdHKXNS6">a survey</a>&nbsp;if you are interested in participating in a poll of "how many grasps do you see in this video", whose results I will update in this blog post.&nbsp;</p><p>If we need to solve 13 additional manipulation skills just to open a package of dates, and each one of these capabilities take 2-3 years to build, then we are a long, long way from making robots that match the capabilities of humans. Never mind that there isn't a clear strategy for how to integrate all these behaviors together into a single algorithmic routine. Believe me, I wish reality was simple enough that complex robotic manipulation could be done mostly&nbsp;in Software 1.0. However, as we move beyond pick-and-place towards dexterous and complex tasks, I think we will need to completely rethink how we integrate different capabilities in robotics.</p><p>As you might note from the video, the meaning of a "grasp" is somewhat blurry. Biological intelligence was not specifically evolved for grasping - rather, hands and their behaviors emerged from a few core drives:&nbsp; regulate internal and external conditions, find snacks, replicate.</p><div><div><p>None of this is to say that our current robot platforms and the Software 1.0 programming models are useless for robotics research or applications. A general purpose function&nbsp;<span>pick_up_object()&nbsp;</span>can still be combined with "Software 1.0 code" into a reliable system worth billions of dollars in value to Amazon warehouses and other logistics fulfillment centers. General pick-and-place for any object in any unstructured environment remains an unsolved, valuable, and&nbsp;<i>hard</i>&nbsp;research problem.</p></div><p><b>Hardware for General Robots</b></p><p>What robotic hardware do we require in order to "open a package of dates"?</p><p>Willow Garage was one of the pioneers in home robots, showing that a teleoperated PR2 robot could be used to tidy up a room (note that two arms are needed here for more precise placement of pillows). These are made up of many pick-and-place operations.</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="374" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o7JH3UWO6I0" width="450" youtube-src-id="o7JH3UWO6I0"></iframe></p><p>This video was made in 2008. That was 12 years ago! It's sobering to think of how much time has passed and how little the needle has seemingly moved. Reality is hard.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://hello-robot.com/product">Stretch</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;a simple telescoping arm attached to a vertical gantry. It can do things like pick up objects, wipe planar surfaces, and open drawers.</p><div><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="373" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2msVU0ygrqM" width="449" youtube-src-id="2msVU0ygrqM"></iframe></p><p>However, futurist beware! A common source of hype for people who don't think enough about physical reality is to watch demos of robots doing useful things in one home, and then conclude that the same robots are ready to do those tasks in <i>any home</i>.</p><div><p>The Stretch video shows the&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/2msVU0ygrqM?t=41">robot pulling open a dryer door</a>&nbsp;(left-swinging) and retrieving clothes from it. The video is a bit deceptive - I think the camera&nbsp; physically cannot see the interior of the dryer, so even though a human can teleoperate the robot to do the task, it would run into serious difficulty when ensuring that the dryer has been completely emptied.</p><p>Here is a picture of my own dryer, which features a dryer with a <i>right-swinging</i>&nbsp;door close to a wall. I'm not sure if the Stretch actually can fit in this tight space, but the PR2 definitely would not be able to open this door without the base getting in the way.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n8U9MC3ww-Q/X8MEUSH03jI/AAAAAAAAepg/JkqUn4xiirU2wiJ76aEC4av5ukvVqNtkACNcBGAsYHQ/s2048/128546115_197081455371161_5776583945816761781_n.jpg"><img data-original-height="2048" data-original-width="1536" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n8U9MC3ww-Q/X8MEUSH03jI/AAAAAAAAepg/JkqUn4xiirU2wiJ76aEC4av5ukvVqNtkACNcBGAsYHQ/s320/128546115_197081455371161_5776583945816761781_n.jpg"></a><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wxb4M30Yk3A/X8MEhN4mcvI/AAAAAAAAepo/Pv7jQZ_NXPU19mjwdHnZGQKf2FHcbrAmQCNcBGAsYHQ/s1920/128903470_992029601279712_5029308404263396832_n.png"><img data-original-height="1920" data-original-width="1080" height="400" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wxb4M30Yk3A/X8MEhN4mcvI/AAAAAAAAepo/Pv7jQZ_NXPU19mjwdHnZGQKf2FHcbrAmQCNcBGAsYHQ/w225-h400/128903470_992029601279712_5029308404263396832_n.png" width="225"></a></p></div><div><p>Reality's edge cases are often swept under the rug when making robot demo videos, which usually show the robot operating in an optimal environment that the robot is well-suited for. But the full range of tasks humans do in the home is&nbsp;<i>vast</i>.&nbsp; Neither the PR2 nor the Stretch can crouch under a table to pick up lint off the floor, change a lightbulb while standing on a chair, fix caulking in a bathroom, open mail with a letter opener, move dishes from the dishwasher to the high cabinets, break down cardboard boxes for the recycle bin, go outside and retrieve the mail.&nbsp;</p><div><p>And of course, they can't even open a Ziploc package of dates. If you think <i>that </i>was&nbsp;complex, here is a first-person video of me chopping strawberries, washing utensils, and decorating a cheesecake. This was recorded with a GoPro strapped to my head. Watch each time my fingers twitch - each one is a separate manipulation task!</p></div><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Hd7JkOo0B8" width="482" youtube-src-id="_Hd7JkOo0B8"></iframe></p><br></div><p>We often talk about a future where robots do our cooking for us, but I don't think it's possible with any hardware on the market today. The only viable hardware for a robot meant to do <i>any task</i> in human spaces is an adult-sized humanoid, with two-arms, two-legs, and five fingers on each hand.&nbsp;</p><p>Just like I discussed about Software 1.0 in robotics, there is still an enormous space of robot morphologies that can still provide value to research and commercial applications. That doesn't change the fact that any alternative hardware can't do all the things a humanoid can in a human-centric space. Agility Robotics is one of the companies <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKjRVlzKEMI">that gets it</a>&nbsp;on the hardware design front. People who build physical robots use their hands a lot -&nbsp;could you imagine the robot you are building assembling a copy of itself?&nbsp;</p><p><b>Why Don't We Just Design Environments to be More Robot-Friendly?</b></p><p>A compromise is to co-design the environment with the robot to avoid infeasible tasks like above. This can simplify both the hardware and software problems. Common examples I hear <i>incessantly </i>go like this:</p><div><ol><li>Washing machines are better than a bimanual robot washing dishes in the sink, and a dryer is a more efficient machine than a human hanging out clothes to air-dry.</li><li>Airplanes are better at …</li></ol></div></div></div></div></div>

			                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This article is a Q&amp;A format with Pierre-Ã‰tienne Meunier, the creator and lead developer of the Pijul VCS (version control system).</p>
<h2>Q: What is your background in computer science and software development?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I've been an academic researcher for about 10 years, and I've recently left academia to found a science company working on issues related to energy savings and decentralised energy production. I'm the only computer scientist, and we work with sociologists and energy engineers.</p>
<p>While I was in academia, my main area of work was asynchronous and geometric computing, whose goal is to understand how systems with lots of simple components can interact in a geometric space to make computation happen. My current work is also somewhat related to this, although in a different way.</p>
<p>My favourite simple components differ from man-made "silicon cores", in that they happen in nature or at least in the real world, and are not made for the specific purpose of computation. For many years, I've worked on getting molecules to self-organise in a test tube to form meaningful shapes. And I've also worked on Pijul, where different authors edit a document in a disorderly way, without necessarily agreeing on "good practices" beforehand.</p>
<p>The idea of Pijul came while Florent Becker and myself were writing a paper on self-assembly. At some point we started thinking about the shortcomings of Darcs (Florent was one of the core contributors of Darcs at the time). We decided that we had to do something about it, to keep the "mathematically designed" family of version-controlled systems alive.</p>
<h2>Q: What is your approach to learning, furthering your knowledge and understanding on a topic?  What resources do you use?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The thing I love the most about computer science is that it can be used to think about a wide variety of subjects of human knowledge, and yet you can get a very concrete and very cheap experience of it by programming a computer. In all disciplines, the main way for virtually anyone to learn technical and scientific things is to play with them.</p>
<p>For example you can read a book about economics, and then immediately write little simulations of games from game theories, or a basic simulator of macroeconomics. You can read the Wikipedia page about wave functions, and then start writing code to simulate a quantum computer. These simulations will not be efficient or realistic, but they will allow their authors to formalise their ideas in a concrete and precise way.</p>
<p>By following this route, you not only get a door into the subject you wanted to understand initially, you also get access to philosophical questions that seemed very abstract before, since computer science is a gateway between the entire world of "pure reason" (logic and mathematics), as Kant would say, and the physical world. What can we know for a fact? Is there a reality beyond language? And suddenly you get a glimpse of what Hume, Kant, Wittgensteinâ€¦ were after.</p>
<h2>Q: What was the first programming language you learned and how did you get into it?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I think I started with C when I was around 12. My uncle had left France to take an administrative position high up at the Vatican, and left most of his things with his brothers and sisters. My mother got his computer, a Victor v286, which was already pretty old when we got it (especially in the days where Moore's law was at its peak). Almost nothing was supplied with it: MS-DOS, a text processor, and a C IDE. So if I wanted to use it, I had little choice. I don't remember playing much with the text processor.</p>
<h2>Q: Why did you decide to start a Version Control System? What is it about VCS that interests you?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> My first contact with version control systems was with SVN at university, and I remember being impressed when I first started using it for the toy project we were working on.</p>
<p>Then, when I did my PhD, my friends and colleagues convinced me to switch to Darcs. As the aspirant mathematician I was, the idea of a rigorous patch theory, where detecting conflicts was done entirely by patch commutation, was appealing. As everybody else, I ran every now and then into Darcs' issues with conflicts, until Florent and I noticed that (1) it had become nearly impossible to convince our skeptical colleagues to install and use it and (2) this particular corner of version control systems was surprisingly close to the rest of our research interests, and that's how we got started.</p>
<h2>Q: How do you decide what projects to work on?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> This is one of my biggest problems in life. I'm generally interested in a large number of things, and I have little time to explore all of them in the depth they deserve. When I have to choose, I try to do what I think will teach me (and hopefully others) the most, or what will change things the most.</p>
<h2>Q: Why did you choose to write Pijul in Rust?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We didn't really choose, Rust was the only language at the time that ticked all the boxes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Statically typed with automatic memory management, because we were writing mathematical code, and we were just two coders, so we needed as much help from compilers as we could get. That essentially meant one of OCaml, Haskell, Scala, Rust, Idris.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fast, because we knew we would be benchmarked against Git. That ruled out Scala (because of startup times) and Idris, which was experimental at the time. Also, Haskell can be super fast, but the performance is hard to guarantee deterministically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could call C functions on Windows. That ruled out OCaml (this might have been fixed since then), and was a strong argument for Rust, since the absence of a GC makes this particularly easy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An additional argument for Rust is that compiling stuff is super easy. Sure, there are system dependencies, but most of the time, things "just work". It works so well that most things that people are encouraged to split their work into multiple crates rather than bundling it up into a large monolithic library. As a consequence, even very simple programs can easily have dozens of dependencies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Q: When you encounter a tough development problem, what is your process to solve it? Especially if the problem is theoretical in nature?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> It really depends on the problem, but I tend to start all my projects by playing with toy examples, until I understand something new. I take notes about the playing, and then try to harden the reasoning by making the intuitive parts rigorous. This is often where bugs (both in mathematical proofs and in software) are hidden. Often, this needs a new iteration of playing, and sometimes many more. I usually find that coding is a good way to play with a problem, even though it isn't always possible, especially in later iterations of the project.</p>
<p>Of course, for things like Pijul, code is needed all the way to the end, but it is a different sort of code, not the "prototype" kind used to understand a problem.</p>
<p>Apart from that, I find that taking a break to walk outside, without forcing myself to stay too focused on the problem, is very useful. I also do other, more intensive sports, but they rarely help solve my problems.</p>
<h2>Q: How big is the Pijul team? Who is it made up of?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> For quite a while there was just Florent and myself, then a few enthusiasts joined us to work on the previous version: we had about 10 contributors, including Thomas Letan who, in addition to his technical contributions, organised the community, welcomed people, etc. And Tae Sandoval, who wrote a popular tutorial (Pijul for Git users), and has been convincing people on social media at an impressive rate for a few years.</p>
<p>Now that we have a candidate version that seems applicable to real-life projects, the team has started growing again, and the early alpha releases of version 1.0.0, even though they still have a few bugs, are attracting new contributors and testers.</p>
<h2>Q: What are your goals for Pijul capabilities, growth, and adoption?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> When Pijul becomes stable, it will be usable for very large projects, and bring more sanity to source code management, by making things more deterministic.</p>
<p>This has the potential to save a large number of engineering hours globally, and to use continuous integration tools more wisely: indeed, on large repositories, millions of CPU-hours are wasted each year just to check that Git and others didn't shuffle lines around during a merge.</p>
<p>Smaller projects, beginners and non-technical people could also benefit from version control, but they aren't using it now, or at least not enough, because the barrier is just too high. Moreover, in some fields of industry and administration, people are doing version control manually, which seems like a giant waste of human time to me, but I also know that no current tool can do that job.</p>
<p>About growth and adoption, I also want to mention that Pijul started as an open source project, and that we are strongly committed to keeping it
open source. Since there is a large amount of tooling to be developed around it to encourage adoption (such as text editor plugins, CI/CD
toolingâ€¦), we are currently trying to build a commercial side as well, in order to fund these developments. This could be in the form of support, hosting, or maybe specialised applications of Pijul, or all that at the same time.</p>
<h2>Q: Do you think Pijul (or any other VCS) could ever overtake Git?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I think there could be a space for both. Git is meant as a content-addressable storage engine, and is extraordinarily efficient at that. One thing that is particularly cool with focusing on versions is that diffs can be computed after the fact, and I can see how this is desirable sometimes. For example, for cases where only trivial merges happen (for example adding a file), such as scientific data, this models the reality quite well, as there is no …</p></div></div></div>

<p>If you want a password management system that is plain-text based, let me introduce to you my setup which utilizes GPG encrypted files to do that.</p>

<p>It uses GPG to encrypt markdown files containing my login credentials, and Syncthing to synchronize them to my Android phone to realize cross-device availability.</p>


<!--To be more exact, I create markdown files and store my login credentials plain-text, then-->

<ul>
  <li>On my computer, I use
    <ul>
      <li><code>gpg</code> to encrypt the markdown files</li>
      <li><a href="https://vimawesome.com/plugin/gnupg-vim">jamessan/vim-gnupg</a> Vim plugin to easily decrypt and edit the files</li>
      <li><code>Git</code> to version control the folder so I have full history of my login credentials</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To access them from my phone, I use
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a> to synchronize the folder to my phone</li>
      <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain&amp;hl=en">OpenKeychain</a> app to decrypt and read the encrypted files</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I could just Syncthing the markdown files <em>without encryption</em> to my phone, but on the off chance that my phone is stolen / lost / hacked, I don’t want my passwords to go down with it, so it is safer to have it gpg encrypted.</p>

<p><del>I’m aware of <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">pass</a> and tried it before I came to this setup, but I want to put more info than just a password string in my files, so that’s why <code>pass</code> doesn’t fit my need.</del>
As many have pointed out in this <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25247211">HackerNews thread</a>, pass allows multi-line edit, so this paragraph is incorrect.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-replicate-this-setup">How to replicate this setup</h3>

<p><strong>1. Generate a PGP keypair with GPG</strong></p>

<p>you can skip this if you already have a keypair.</p>

<p>$ <code>gpg --full-gen-key</code></p>

<p><strong>2. Install the Vim plugin and put in corresponding config</strong></p>

<p>Assuming you’re using VimPlug ( a vim plugin manager ),
put this into your ~/.vimrc and run <code>:PlugInstall</code> in Vim.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Plug 'jamessan/vim-gnupg'
" Armor files
let g:GPGPreferArmor=1
" Set the default option
let g:GPGDefaultRecipients=["youremail@provider.com"]"
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>NOTE: remember to modify the <code>youremail@provider.com</code> to the email associated with your PGP key</p>

<!--This plugin will auto decrypt encrypted files when you open them with Vim, making the only difference with opening a normal unencrypted file a slight delay of opening the file due to the decryption process.-->
<!--有点啰嗦 this ^ line, comment it out first-->

<p><strong>3. Create a markdown file</strong></p>

<p>$ <code>touch mygmail.md</code></p>

<p><strong>4. Encrypt the markdown file</strong></p>

<!--$ `gpg --recipient youremail@provider.com --armor --output %f.asc --encrypt %f`-->
<p>$ <code>gpg -e -r youremail@provider.com path/to/file</code></p>

<p>if you use <a href="https://github.com/ranger/ranger">Ranger</a>, you can put this mapping into your rc.conf to encrypt it easily by pressing <code>te</code> when the selection is hovering on the file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>map te shell gpg --recipient youremail@provider.com --armor --output %f.asc --encrypt %f &amp;&amp; rm %f
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Open the file with Vim to make sure it can auto decrypt and open up the file.</p>


<p><strong>5. Setup Syncthing</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://syncthing.net/downloads/">Install Syncthing</a> on Linux and Android, then set it up to sync your password folder to your phone.</p>

<p><strong>6. Setup OpenKeychain</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain&amp;hl=en">OpenKeychain</a> Android app on your phone</p>
  </li>
  <li>export your PGP private key from Linux
    <div><div><pre><code>  $ gpg --export-secret-keys --armor youremail@provider.com &gt; privkey.asc
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Transfer the file to your Android phone (for example through wire)</li>
  <li>Import the key file into <code>OpenKeychain</code> app</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>7. Try decrypting your files on Android</strong></p>

<p>To decrypt and view your password file:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <code>OpenKeychain</code> app</li>
  <li>
    <p>Press the hamburger menu icon on the top left</p>
  </li>
  <li>Press <code>Encrypt/Decrypt</code></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://tylerlmz1.github.io/assets/decrypt.png" width="200px"></p>

<ol>
  <li>Press <code>Select input file</code> and browse to the encrypted password file</li>
  <li>Enter your PGP key passphrase</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>8. Done</strong></p>

<div>
  
  <p><span>Nov 2020</span></p>
  <p>I’ve been on the <a href="https://nixos.org/" target="_blank">Nix</a> train for about half a year now, and I have to say that it has completely changed how I look at my development setup. Before Nix, setting up my computer on the Mac was always a mess of Homebrew packages that I would install, being dependent on whatever’s available in the repository, and being forced to have everything installed globally. There’s also not a good way to keep track of what I have installed, there’s potential for conflicting packages, it’s just not great.</p>

<p>Nix changed all of that. I could now version check my environment, I could try out a package in a subshell before installing it globally, I can even easily pin a package to a specific version using <a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Overlays" target="_blank">Overlays</a>. Installing things is very fast in general because Nix has great caching, which it can download and install from without any compilation or linking.</p>

<h2 id="but-what-is-it">But what is it?</h2>

<p>It took me a while to understand Nix and all the different projects that are affiliated with it, but the gist of it is this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Nix is a <em>build</em> tool that is aware of all the dependencies (files, other things that have already been built) for a dependency. When something is built, it takes all the names of the dependencies, and all the files that are needed and hashes those together. That hash is then the name of the thing you just built (hold that thought) and put into the ‘Nix store’—this resides at <code>/nix</code> on your system.</li>
  <li>All the Nix packages are set up to build in a way that they don’t reference anything outside of Nix. So when they build, then can only reference other Nix packages (for which that is also true etc. etc.) and files on the web by hash. So if you want to download the source code of something on the web, you need to put the sha hash of that thing in your Nix build instructions so it can ensure that the same thing is always used. The Nix build tool ensures that nothing outside the Nix store is used during build—by clearing out the environment variables for example.</li>
  <li>Once you build something in this way, you can reference it by linking to it from outside the store. For example, I can setup a Vim config and a bunch of plugins and then I can link <code>~/.vimrc</code> to the Vim config after it was built inside the store. This link is to some hashed name.</li>
</ol>

<p>This clever set up makes sure that if I can build a package on my machine, you will <em>always</em> be able to build it on yours as well, because Nix makes sure that all the packages that need to be built are unable to be influenced by all the other mess on our computers. This is super cool!</p>

<h2 id="fun-tricks">Fun tricks</h2>

<p>I put my whole environment on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/bouk/b" target="_blank">bouk/b</a> which means I can check it out and install it very quickly. I can even install the same configuration on Mac and Linux, which is pretty mind-blowing! It just works.</p>

<p>You can run <code>nix-shell https://bou.ke</code> and get my whole environment in a subshell (note: it will take a while to build everything). I achieved that little trick by adding this to my <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank">Cloudflare Workers</a> config:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>const ua = event.request.headers.get('User-Agent');
if (url.pathname === '/' &amp;&amp; ua.match(/\bNix\//) != null) {
  return new Response('', { status: 302, headers: { location: `https://github.com/bouk/b/archive/master.tar.gz` } });
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because it doesn’t matter what else is on your machine, Nix can safely build up my environment with the versions of software that <strong>I</strong> want and run it on your computer, without worrying about what’s already on there! So cool!</p>

<h2 id="what-i-want-development-environments-to-be-like">What I want development environments to be like</h2>

<p>I got onto this whole Nix path because of my former colleague <a href="https://burke.libbey.me/" target="_blank">Burke</a>’s writing and YouTube series <a href="https://shopify.engineering/what-is-nix" target="_blank">over at Shopify</a>. Nix can really shine in development environments, where you have to share a bunch of dependencies (a compiler, database, etc.) between a large number of developers. Being able to use Nix to specify all the programs that you’re depending on means you don’t need to tell people to install a bunch of crap onto their machine and fight with stuff just to get it all working, just let them install Nix and use its magic to make everything work.</p>

<p>What I want is for <a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes" target="_blank">Nix Flakes</a> to become a thing, so you also don’t need people to install stuff like direnv into their shell and have a daemon running like <a href="https://github.com/target/lorri" target="_blank">lorri</a> just to have a decent workflow. No, what I want is to be able to write a bash script like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#! /usr/bin/env nix &lt;something flakes something&gt;
pg_ctl start -D ./tmp/postgres start
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And have it run the exact same version of Postgres on everyone’s machines. Whenever this file is run, Nix should make sure that the locked dependencies are installed—if I understand correctly, then with Flakes this should be instant. Then it will run this script inside a shell that contains all the required things, so everyone can consistently share versions.</p>

<p>I’m not a Nix maximalist, I don’t think we need to have all of a projects dependencies in Nix. For example, I use <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank">Go</a> a lot for projects and I’m not using some ‘Go module to Nix translation’ thing, because I can rely on Go’s package manager to do the right thing. I do want to use Nix to make sure that everyone is using the same Go version however. This strikes the right balance between developer experience and reliability, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Lately I’ve also been railing against Docker for local development. It’s nuts that on Macbooks we are running a virtual machine to run containers to run databases, when this should just be a process on your computer. The only reason people are doing this is because there is a need to consistently install dependencies, Docker is the only hammer people think they have in their toolbox. With Nix we could just run it on everyone’s computer directly, without nested virtualization and killing people’s battery. It’s aesthetically gross to run a whole VM to run a single process. But we can do better!</p>

<p>Has social media democratized reporting as promised?
We’ve democratized <em>writing and publishing</em> but this year has made the point that there’s more to journalism than hitting send.
The rest of the stuff that happens in the newsroom has stayed in the newsroom:
cultivating sources, editing for quality, and most importantly, fact-checking.</p>

<p>Lacking checks, social media is amplifying or at least fertilizing false beliefs,
and then people cross state lines to shoot up pizza joints.
If the newsroom’s adversarial functions can’t make the jump to social media,
life will continue to be this weird.</p>

<p>We’re starting to address fact-checking, and will do more.
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/11/why-cant-internet-companies-stop-awful-content/">Failing to curb antisocial behavior kills companies</a>, as well as communities.</p>

<p>Facebook has the technology to filter out the worst-quality content that their users think is ‘P(bad for the world)’ – <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinroose/status/1331257332538359810">but only at the cost of lower engagement</a>.
Given these incentives, nobody benefits if we leave this to platforms to solve.
Users should bring their own moderation to the web.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="private-groups-will-decamp-if-they-dont-like-the-fact-bubbles">Private groups will decamp if they don’t like the fact bubbles</h2>

<p>Filter bubbles don’t have to put up with fact bubbles.
By filter bubbles, I mean clique groups that see mostly content that supports their priors.
By fact bubbles, I mean those blue exclamation marks that say ‘official sources have called the election differently’.</p>

<p>Private groups have the power to resist centralized moderation if they don’t like it.
Private groups are sticky which is why facebook <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18524188/facebook-f8-keynote-mark-zuckerberg-privacy-future-2019">bet their future on them</a>,
but this stickiness makes them hard to control.
Yes, their internal cohesion leads to engagement on FB, but it also allows them to move off the platform if they’re unhappy.
They own their slice of the network; their moat has a drawbridge.</p>

<p>A heavy hand will drive private groups to dark corners of the web –
not <em>un</em>-moderated exactly, because trust me, nobody wants that.
But ‘differently moderated’.
Reality is a participation sport and groups which don’t want to participate, won’t.</p>

<p>That said, deplatforming isn’t zero-cost for groups:
they recruit in public spaces, and are helped by ‘suggested groups’ features (which FB <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-suspended-group-recommendations-election">partially disabled</a> for the election).
Standalone forums can’t grow like that.
The fickle graces of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/5/20754943/8chan-epik-offline-voxility-service-cutoff-hate-speech-ban">hosts</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/4/20754310/cloudflare-8chan-fredrick-brennan-ddos-attack">DDOS-protection companies</a> also make it hard to go solo.</p>

<p>But it’s not like IRL networks will stop feeding online groups.
The counterargument to ‘social media gives bad politicians a voice’ is that once someone has been elected, they’ll probably <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7131IkiSCg">have a voice anyway</a>.
FB’s design gives eyeballs to demagogues but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_des_Willens">so did Leni Riefenstahl</a>.</p>

<p>As I drafted this in early november, twitter was fact-bubbling multiple tweets in a row from the president,
the ‘uncensored’ social media app parler <a href="https://twitter.com/yashar/status/1325229370126991363">trended to #1</a> in apple’s store,
and local hero <a href="https://twitter.com/WilliamShatner/status/1326223481646665728">Bill Shatner took up the cause of moderation</a> to oppose them.
The ‘moderation drives exodus’ hypothesis is plausible.</p>

<p>But parler can’t really want to be unmoderated.
Their debut came with a quick correction that despite the sales pitch, <a href="https://twitter.com/viaCristiano/status/1277941967402553345">your username can’t be cumdumpster</a>.
(<a href="https://twitter.com/cumdumpster">Twitter has allowed this</a> since at least 2013).</p>

<p>My point: nobody wants to live in a trash can.
Every community has some kind of semi-official management.
I think even 8kun revoked someone’s access to the Q account after they had a falling out (admittedly, not over content I think, and also I don’t really understand this world).
But the <em>forms</em> of moderation we invent have to be trusted or at least tolerated, or people will ditch.</p>

<p>Fact-checking, if it’s trustworthy and useful, will be embraced IMO. But it can’t be imposed.</p>

<h2 id="conspiracies-are-topics-too">Conspiracies are topics too</h2>

<p>A swedish friend, trying to explain why their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden_Democrats">far-right party</a> gained power in the Riksdag,
said something like ‘It’s not that we’re all nazis, but nobody else would even talk about immigration, and it’s a real problem’.</p>

<p>I like the ‘marketplace of ideas’ as a concept.<sup id="fnref:marketplace" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:marketplace">1</a></sup>
Markets are an interesting model for public discourse.
Like goods on markets, there are a limited number of explanations or ideologies available (assuming most people can’t coin our own – for various reasons, I believe we can’t).
Also, like a real market, it’s two-sided, in that in addition to the ideas on offer, there are buyers:
people looking for an action, belief, or political party that suits them.</p>

<p>The marketplace model explains why political parties get to lie out loud, be revealed for hypocrisy, and admit their strategy is disingenuous.
They’re <em>still</em> the only rallying point for ‘critical idea X’ that their buyers need.
It may not matter to the fighting faithful if the center is hollow.
They’re willing to ignore the cognitive dissonance.</p>

<p>I wonder if there’s a similar effect in the antivax movement –
autism seems to really be on the rise (0.7 to 1.5% in this century),
and if your family is affected by this, and there’s no other explanation, you ‘buy’ the idea that comes with a clear cause and a solution.</p>

<h2 id="cranky-boomers-r-us">Cranky boomers R us</h2>

<p>People are seeking answers that are plausible to them,
but may not be able or willing to dig deeply, and may not be ready to hear the truth if it means abandoning their hope, identity, or <a href="https://phys.org/news/2020-11-beliefs-world-filter.html">existing opinions</a>.
I suspect if someone is at the bottom of a rabbit hole and sees a fact bubble saying ‘this is stupid’, that’s the same as saying ‘you’re stupid’, and they won’t listen.
The challenge here is matching them with a well-meaning authority whom they’ll trust and find useful.</p>

<p>There was a measles outbreak in Minnesota enabled by high vaccine refusal rate in a single immigrant community.
Parents noticed a lot of their kids in special autism education<sup id="fnref:stat-antivax" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:stat-antivax">2</a></sup>, then fell prey to antivax lecturers or something.
But the parents had access to doctors.
And presumably they had access to other experts at the autism schools.
They ignored the fact bubble.
They chose who to trust.</p>

<p>On the flip side, community-owned moderation sometimes works rather well.
I’m thinking about subreddits, who tend to have very specific rules about what to post, and their users accept that these communities are actively moderated for the benefit of the community.
(Given that the community is a result of moderation, this is a little circular and feedback loop-y, but that may not be a bad thing).</p>

<p>I asked a friend who mods a small subbredit what it’s like:
“In six years, no one has ever said anything mean on my subreddit. I’ve never had to ban anyone and submitters and subscribers are respectful.”</p>

<p>Cranky boomers got us into this mess by believing everything they read on facebook.
Maybe Cranky-Boomers-R-Us™️ is the right branding for a community fact check to filter out some fast-spreading egregious claims.</p>

<p>We train people to consider the source, but mainstream mastheads like NYT feel ideologically hostile to readers who aren’t centrists over 55.
Their news coverage can be accurate without being neutral – factual claims in articles are fact-checked, but that’s mixed with interpretive conclusions.
The op-eds are <a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/james_bennet_tom_cotton_objectivity.php">far stranger</a>.</p>

<p>I don’t blame people for switching to ideologically comfortable news.
I just wish they had a fact-check that was ideologically comfortable, but also competent and reputation-bound, to go along with it.</p>

<p>Repentant neocon Francis Fukuyama writes about social trust now and is <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/the-emergence-of-a-post-fact-world-by-francis-fukuyama-2017-01">worried about post-fact world</a> where
“all authoritative information sources are challenged by contrary facts of dubious quality and provenance”.
Readers have reasons for straying from reality.
Let’s give people an ideologically comfortable way to come back.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harm_reduction">Gentler public health messaging</a> that accepts people’s lifestyles can have higher efficacy;
I suspect the same is true of fact-checks.
Our goal isn’t to change minds; it’s to improve outcomes.</p>

<h2 id="byo-vs-centralized-moderation">BYO vs centralized moderation</h2>

<p>We need a market ecosystem of moderation vendors who provide different kinds of value to different kinds of users.
A moderation marketplace is good for platforms because they don’t want to be the arbiter of truth, they just want users to have a good experience.
(Platforms will still have some policing to do on their own).</p>

<p>It’s good for users because they’re not forced into anything; they can pick which web they want to dwell on.
This may sound like a filter bubble, where ‘everyone has their own truth’,
but moderation vendors will still need to maintain their reputation for being right –
whatever their ideological alignment.
Moderation vendors, unlike cable news channels, don’t produce content;
they just react to it and grade it.
BYO moderation isn’t BYO newspaper, it’s BYO snopes / politifact.</p>

<p>Centralized moderation has problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The costs are asymmetric, meaning it’s too expensive to do widely, well, and fast (see lego point below). Jimmy Wales of wikipedia describes the economics here leading to a <a href="https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/jimmy-wales-tyler-cowen-wikipedia-610b6e931d20">sweatshop model</a>.</li>
  <li>It’s susceptible to abuse by platforms and institutions and therefore will be less trusted by users, especially the more conspiracy-minded ones whom we want to deradicalize. Note I’m not saying ‘prone to abuse’ or ‘untrustworthy’. Just less trust-<em>ed</em>, and less able to balance minority viewpoints in a way that feels authentic to minorities.</li>
  <li>Private groups will turn off mod systems if not effective / ergonomic / trustable, or else deplatform.</li>
  <li>For messy issues, cookie-cutter moderation can <a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/caught-net-impact-extremist-speech-regulations-human-rights-content">support violence by hiding its proof</a>. Or like <a href="https://twitter.com/KatMurti/status/1276183164109697028">where’s the parler for breastfeeding</a>?</li>
</ul>

<p>Every community needs moderation.
Some get away without it because they moderate membership rather than content –
small workplaces, for example, have relatively informal content moderation processes, but can fire you.</p>

<p>This isn’t just a facebook / twitter issue anymore – it’s a problem for anyone with a supply of eyeballs and UGC or DM features, like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/11/07/pinterest-linkedin-election-disinfo/">pinterest and linkedin</a>.
The older and funnier version of this is the <a href="https://www.managingcommunities.com/2015/06/04/lego-universes-penis-problem-and-why-moderation-efforts-arent-hopeless/">lego MMO’s penis problem</a> –

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-2059">

<div>
<p>Which normal form (NF) is my table in? How do I normalize? How to decompose to 3NF? BCNF? How to understand the 5th normal form? Mess, confusion, chaos, conflicting advice, endless arguing on StackOverflow. Misleading advice, even in books.</p>
<h2>In Short</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Normalization is a process for removing and preventing logical errors in a relational database.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of the time this involves implementing proper constraints and reducing — eliminating when possible — redundancy by decomposition into projections.</p>
<h2>Fun Example</h2>
<p>A group of ten J-named people: Jane, Jack, Jill, Joe, James, Janet, Jackie, Jacob, Joan, and Jim, decide to make a SQL DB about themselves. One of tables in the DB is named <em>smoker</em>, stating who smokes.</p>
<h3>Case 1</h3>
<pre>smoker
+-------------+
| NME    (PK) |
+-------------+
| Jack        |
| James, Jill |
| Joan        |
+-------------+
</pre>
<ol>
<li>Comment on the current NF.</li>
<li>Is it possible to fix and how?</li>
<li>Comment on the NF after the fix.</li>
<li>How to prevent the error for any future data changes?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Case 2</h3>
<p>Same scenario, but this time the table is empty.</p>
<pre>smoker {NME}
    PK {NME}
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Consider the same four questions as in the previous case.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Case 3</h3>
<p>Again the table is empty. This time is has a foreign key (FK) to a table named <em>person</em>, which lists all ten people in the group.</p>
<pre>smoker {NME}
    PK {NME}
    FK {NME} REFERENCES person {NME}
</pre>
<ul>
<li>The same four questions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/grok" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Grok</a> the example and you will grok normalization. You will also understand what is wrong with the myriad of normalization procedures found all over the web. Many are simply misleading, although may be considered technically correct.</p>
<p>Grokking something is a very personal thing, so it may be best if do not provide answers. Well, <a href="https://www.damirsystems.com/static/txt/grok_normalization_a.txt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">try not to look</a>.</p>
<p>Is this all there is to it? No, but understanding this will make you <em>immune</em> to misleading examples. Once you get this, it is easy to read about this-and-that NF examples, problems, and fixes.</p>
<p>If I had to recommend only one book, it would be a tossup between <a href="https://www.damirsystems.com/references/#[Hal08]" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hal08</a> and <a href="https://www.damirsystems.com/references/#[Dat05]" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dat05</a>. Both require study. However, as a <em>developer</em> you do not need to obsess about NFs. Stick to a <a href="https://www.damirsystems.com/forgotten-simplicity/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">simple design method</a> and your tables will be in a high NF as a <em>natural consequence</em> of the design. Use predicates and constraints, everything else will fall in place.</p>
<hr>
<pre>All attributes (columns) NOT NULL

PK = Primary Key
FK = Foreign Key
</pre>

            </figure>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>In four years, I’ve only <a href="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/competition-is-for-losers/">once</a> published someone’s work on my site. </p><p>Today, I break the rule again.</p><p>Charlie Munger gave this talk 24 years ago, and it’s still the best example of business thinking you can read online. </p><p>Enter Charlie.</p><p><em>An Informal Talk, July 20, 1996</em></p><p>The title of my talk is “Practical Thought About Practical Thought?” – with a question mark at the end.</p><p>In a long career, I have assimilated various ultra-simple general notions that I find helpful in solving problems. Five of these helpful notions I will now describe. After that, I will present to you a problem of extreme scale. Indeed, the problem will involve turning start-up capital of $2 million into $2 trillion, a sum large enough to represent a practical achievement. Then I will try to solve the problem, assisted by my helpful general notions. Following that, I will suggest that there are important educational implications in my demonstration. I will so finish because my objective is educational, my game today being a search for better methods of thought.</p><p>The first helpful notion is that it is usually best to simplify problems by deciding big “no-brainer” questions first.</p><p>The second helpful notion mimics Galileo’s conclusion that scientific reality is often revealed only by math as if math was the language of God [1]. Galileo’s attitude also works well in messy, practical life. Without numerical fluency, in the part of life most of us inhabit, you are like a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest.</p><p>The third helpful notion is that it is not enough to think problems through forward. You must also think in reverse, much like the rustic who wanted to know where he was going to die so that he’d never go there. Indeed, many problems can’t be solved forward. And that is why the great algebraist Carl Jacobi so often said, “Invert, always invert.” And why the Pythagoreans [2] thought in reverse to prove that the square root of two was an irrational number.</p><p>The fourth helpful notion is that the best and most practical wisdom is elementary academic wisdom. But there is one extremely important qualification: You must think in a multidisciplinary manner. You must routinely use all the easy-to-learn concepts from the freshman course in every basic subject. Where elementary ideas will serve, your problem solving must not be limited, as academia and many business bureaucracies are limited, by extreme balkanization into disciplines and subdisciplines, with strong taboos against any venture outside assigned territory. Instead, you must do your multi-disciplinary thinking in accord with Ben Franklin’s prescription in Poor Richard: “If you want it done, go. If not, send.”</p><p>If, in your thinking, you rely entirely on others, often through purchase of professional advice, whenever outside a small territory of your own, you will suffer much calamity. And it is not just difficulties in complex coordination that will do you in. You will also suffer from the reality evoked by the Savian character who said, “In the last analysis, every profession is a conspiracy against the laity.” Indeed, a Shavian character, for once, understated the horrors of something Shaw didn’t like. It is not usually the conscious malfeasance of your narrow professional adviser that does you in. Instead, your troubles come from his subconscious bias. His cognition will often be impaired, for your purposed, by financial incentives different from yours. And he will also suffer from the psychological defect caused by the proverb: “To a man with a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.”</p><p>The fifth helpful notion is that really big effects, lollapalooza effects, will often come only from large combinations of factors. For instance, tuberculosis was tamed, at least for a long time, only by routine, combined use in each case of three different drugs. Another lollapalooza effects, like the flight of an airplane, follow a similar pattern.</p><p>It is now time to present my practical problem. And here is the problem: It is 1884 in Atlanta, Ga. You are brought, along with twenty others like you, before a rich and eccentric Atlanta citizen named Glotz. Both you and Glotz share two characteristics: First, you routinely use in problem solving the five helpful notions, and, second, you know all the elementary ideas in all the basic college courses, as taught in 1996. However, all discoverers, and all examples demonstrating these elementary ideas come from dates before 1884. </p><p>Neither you nor Glotz know anything about anything that has happened after 1884. Glotz offers to invest two million 1884 dollars, yet take only half the equity, for a Glotz Charitable Foundation, in a new corporation organized to go into the non-alcoholic beverage business and remain in that business only, forever. Glotz wants to use a name that has somehow charmed him: Coca-Cola. </p><p>The other half of the new corporation’s equity will go to the man who most plausibly demonstrates that his business plan will cause Glotz’s foundation to be worth a trillion dollars 150 years later, in the money of that later time, 2034, despite paying out a large part of its earnings each year as a dividend. This will make the whole new corporation worth $2 trillion, even after paying out many billions of dollars in dividends.</p><p>You have fifteen minutes to make your pitch. What do you say to Glotz?</p><p>Here is my solution, my pitch to Glotz, using only the helpful notions and what every bright college sophomore should know.</p><p>Well, Glotz, the big “no-brainer” decisions that, to simplify our problem, should be made first are as follows: </p><p>First, we are never going to create something worth $2 trillion by selling some generic beverage. Therefore, we must make your name, “Coca-Cola,” into a strong, legally protected trademark. </p><p>Second, we can get to $2 trillion only by starting in Atlanta, then succeeding in the rest of the United States, then rapidly succeeding with our new beverage all over the world. This will require developing a product having universal appeal because it harnesses powerful elemental forces. And the right place to find such powerful elemental forces is in the subject matter of elementary academic courses.</p><p>We will next use numerical fluency to ascertain what our target implies. We can guess reasonably that by 2034 there will be about eight billion beverage consumers in the world. On average, each of these consumers will be much more prosperous in real terms than the average consumer of 1884. Each consumer is composed mostly of water and must ingest about sixty four ounces of water per day. This is eight, eight-ounce servings. Thus, if our new beverage, and other imitative beverages in our market, can flavor and otherwise improve only twenty-five percent of ingested water worldwide, and we can occupy half of the new world market, we can sell 2.92 trillion eight ounce servings in 2034. And if we can then net four cents per serving, we will earn $117 billion. This will be enough, if our business is still growing at a good rate, to make it easily worth $2 trillion.</p><p>A big question, of course, is whether four cents per serving is a reasonable profit target for 2034. And the answer is yes if we can create a beverage with strong universal appeal. One hundred and fifty years is a long time. The dollar, like the Roman drachma, will almost surely suffer monetary depreciation. Concurrently, real purchasing power of the average beverage consumer in the world will go way up. His proclivity to inexpensively improve his experience while ingesting water will go up considerably faster. Meanwhile, as technology improves, the cost of our simple product, in units of constant purchasing power, will go down. All four factors will work together in favor of our four-cents-per-serving profit target. Worldwide beverage purchasing power in dollars will probably multiply by a factor of at least forty over 150 years. Thinking in reverse, this makes our profits-per-serving large, under 1884 conditions, a mere one fortieth of four cents or one tenth of a cent per serving. This is an easy-to-exceed target as we start out if our new product has universal appeal.</p><p>That decided, we must next solve the problem of invention to create universal appeal. There are two intertwined challenges of large scale: First, over 150 years, we must cause a new beverage market to assimilate about one-fourth of the world’s water ingestion. </p><blockquote>“I want a can of Coke within arm’s reach of every American serviceman – something to remind him of home.” – Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Allied Commander, World War II.</blockquote><p>Second, we must so operate that half the new market is ours while all our competitors combined are left to share the remaining half. These results are lollapalooza results. Accordingly, we must attack our problem by causing every favorable factor we can think of to work for us. Plainly, only a powerful combination of many factors is likely to cause the lollapalooza consequences we desire. Fortunately, the solution to these intertwined problems turns out to be fairly easy if one has stayed awake in all the freshman courses. </p><p>Let us start by exploring the consequences of our simplifying “no-brainer” decision that we must rely on a strong trademark. This conclusion automatically leads to an understanding of the essence of our business in proper elementary academic terms. We can see from the introductory course in psychology that, in essence, we are going into the business of creating and maintaining conditioned reflexes. The “Coca-Cola” trade name and trade dress will act as the stimuli, l and the purchase and ingestion of our beverage will be the desired responses.</p><p>And how does one create and maintain conditioned reflexes? Well, the psychology text gives two answers: (1) by operant conditioning and (2) by classical conditioning, often called Pavlovian [3] conditioning to honor the great Russian scientist.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Come 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 with the best</h2><p>‍</p><p>Here's a little more on what to expect when you join Launch House.</p><p>‍</p><h4>🏠 Live in an epic house</h4><p>We have a huge mansion in beautiful, sunny Los Angeles – home of palm trees, movie stars, and obnoxiously picture-perfect sunsets. You'll have a plenty of workspace, super fast wifi and everything else you need to do what you do.</p><p>‍</p><h4>🤯 Work with crazy smart people</h4><p>With so many applicants, we have the luxury of selecting the best of the best to join each Launch House cohort. You'll spend your month collaborating with engineers, designers, and product people who have worked at (or even founded) some of the most successful tech companies in the world. Many of these collaborations have lead to residents becoming co-founders of venture-backed startups.</p><p>‍</p><h4>🤩&nbsp;Meet incredible guests</h4><p>One room in the house will be reserved for guest residents. Not randos that need a place to crash, but a curated group of top investors, startup founders, and social media influencers to live and work alongside you during your stay. Past guests included Ryan Hoover, Nathan Latka, Courtland Allen, and Greg Isenberg.</p><p>‍</p><h4>📚 Access amazing resources</h4><p>We've partnered with dozens of top brands in tech like Airtable and Magic Mind to hook you up during your stay and when you become an alumni. We also work with many of the top VCs, angel investors, and operators to help you with everything from go-to-market to fundraising.</p><p>‍</p><h4>📈 Learn and grow</h4><p>You'll have programming each day to help you become a better founder — poolstorms, community dinners, workshops, poolside chats, hackathons, and more. </p><p>‍</p><h4>🎥 Build in public</h4><p>We'll have a videographer and social media influencers floating around the house to film everything from big events to one-off TikTok videos. This isn't a reality show, but we expect everyone to help create a little content of their choosing each week.</p><p>‍</p><h4>🚀 LAUNCH</h4><p>Weekly launch weekends plus ongoing work means someone from the house will be launching almost every day. This is what we came here to do after all.</p><p>‍</p><h4>♥️ Build life-long bonds</h4><p>Launch House residents wind up becoming incredibly close friends (and even co-founders). After your cohort ends, you become an alumni member for life. You'll get access to the community, perks and alumni-organized events (and satellite houses)&nbsp;around the world.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>LRU is one of the most widely used cache eviction algorithms that span its utility across multiple database systems. Although popular, it suffers from a bunch of limitations especially when it is used for managing caches in disk-backed databases like MySQL and Postgres.</p>
<p>In this essay, we take a detailed look into the sub-optimality of LRU and how one of its variants called 2Q addresses and improves upon it. 2Q algorithm was first introduced in the paper - <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2Q%3A-A-Low-Overhead-High-Performance-Buffer-Johnson-Shasha/5fa357b43c8351a5d8e7124429e538ad7d687abc">2Q: A low overhead high-performance buffer management replacement algorithm</a> by Theodore Johnson and Dennis Shasha.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)">LRU eviction algorithm</a> evicts the page from the buffer which has not been accessed for the longest. LRU is typically implemented using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list">Doubly Linked List</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">Hash Table</a>. The intuition of this algorithm is so strong and implementation is so simple that until the early '80s, LRU was the algorithm of choice in nearly all the systems. But as stated above, there are certain situations where LRU performs sub-optimal.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/100534745-43ae8400-3238-11eb-8855-752a6ef2f3c6.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/100534745-43ae8400-3238-11eb-8855-752a6ef2f3c6.png"></p>
<h2>Sub-optimality during DB scans</h2>
<p>If the database table is bigger than the LRU cache, the DB process, upon scanning the table will wipe out the entire LRU cache and fill it with the pages from just one scanned table. If these pages are not referenced again, this is a total loss and the performance of the database takes a massive hit. The performance will pickup once these pages are evicted from the cache and other pages make an entry.</p>
<h2>Sub-optimality in evictions</h2>
<p>LRU algorithm works with a single dimension - recency - as it removes the pages from the buffer on the basis of recent accesses. Since it does not really consider any other factor, it can actually evict a warmer page and replace it with a colder one - a page that could and would be accessed just once.</p>

<p>2Q addresses the above-illustrated issues by introducing parallel buffers and supporting queues. Instead of considering just recency as a factor, 2Q also considers access frequency while making the decision to ensure the page that is really warm gets a place in the LRU cache. It admits only hot pages to the main buffer and tests every page for a second reference.</p>
<p>The golden rule that 2Q is based on is - <em>Just because a page is accessed once does not entitle it to stay in the buffer. Instead, it should be decided if it is accessed again then only keep it in the buffer.</em></p>
<p>Below we take a detailed look into two versions of the 2Q algorithm - simplified and improved.</p>
<h2>Simplified 2Q</h2>
<p>Simplified 2Q algorithm works with two buffers: the primary LRU buffer - <code>Am</code>  and a secondary FIFO buffer - <code>A1</code>. New faulted pages first go to the secondary buffer <code>A1</code> and then when the page is referenced again, it moves to the primary LRU buffer <code>Am</code>. This ensures that the page that moves to the primary LRU buffer is hot and indeed requires to be cached.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/100536835-41a0f100-3249-11eb-920b-0bcaff905906.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/100536835-41a0f100-3249-11eb-920b-0bcaff905906.png"></p>
<p>If the page residing in <code>A1</code> is never referenced again, it eventually gets discarded, implying the page was indeed cold and did not deserve to be cached. Thus this simplified 2Q provides protection against the two listed sub-optimality of the simple LRU scheme by adding a secondary buffer and testing pages for a second reference. The pseudocode for the Simplified 2Q algorithm is as follows:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>access_page</span><span>(X: page)</span>:</span>
    
    
    <span>if</span> X <span>in</span> Am:
         Am.move_front(X)

    
    
    
    
    <span>elif</span> X <span>in</span> A1:
         A1.remove(X)
         Am.add_front(X)

    
    <span>else</span>:
         
         <span>if</span> A1.is_full():
             A1.pop()

         
         A1.add_front(X)
</code></pre>
<p>Tuning Simplified 2Q buffer is difficult - if the maximum size of <code>A1</code> is too small, the test for hotness becomes too strong and if it is too large then due to memory constraint <code>Am</code> will get relatively smaller memory making the primary LRU cache smaller, eventually degrading the database performance.</p>
<p>The full version 2Q algorithm remediates this limitation and eliminates tuning to a massive extent without taking any hit in performance.</p>
<h2>2Q Full Version</h2>
<p>Although Simplified 2Q algorithm does a decent job there is still scope of improvement when it comes to handling common database access pattern, that suggests, a page generally receives a lot of references for a short period of time and then no reference for a long time. If a page truly needs to be cached then after it receives a lot (not just one) of references in a short span it continues to receive references and hits on regular intervals.</p>
<p>To handle this common database access pattern, the 2Q algorithm splits the secondary buffer <code>A1</code> into two buffers <code>A1-In</code> and <code>A1-Out</code>, where the new element always enters <code>A1-In</code> and continues to stay in <code>A1-In</code> till it gets accesses ensuring that the most recent first accesses happen in the memory.</p>
<p>Once the page gets old, it gets thrown off the memory but its disk reference is stored in the <code>A1-Out</code> buffer. If the page, whose reference is, residing in <code>A1-Out</code> is accessed again the page is promoted to <code>Am</code> LRU implying it indeed is a hot page that will be accessed again and hence required to be cached.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/100538168-0bb53a00-3254-11eb-8f69-ddcaf8d33a84.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/100538168-0bb53a00-3254-11eb-8f69-ddcaf8d33a84.png"></p>
<p>The <code>Am</code> buffer continues to be the usual LRU which means when any page residing in <code>Am</code> is accessed it is moved to the head and when a page is needed to be discarded the eviction happens from the tail end.</p>

<p>Postgres uses 2Q as its cache management algorithm due to <a href="http://www.varlena.com/GeneralBits/96.php">patent issues</a> with IBM. Postgres used to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_replacement_cache">ARC</a> as its caching algorithm but with IBM getting a patent over it, Postgres moved to 2Q. Postgres also claims that the performance of 2Q is similar to ARC.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-5234" role="main"><div><div><div><p><strong>A <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2721" target="_blank">new study</a> has found that some popular forms of spiritual training — such as energy healing, aura reading, and, to a lesser degree, mindfulness and meditation — correlate with both narcissism and “spiritual superiority.”</strong></p><p>An implicit feature of spiritual training is that it allows its adherents to distance themselves from their egos, and thereby from things such as the need for social approval or success. By encouraging self-compassion and non-judgmental self-acceptance, spiritual training should presumably make people less concerned with such things.</p><p>But as a new paper explains, spiritual training may have the opposite effect. Namely, spiritual training might in fact enhance people’s need to feel “more successful, more respected or more loved,” as the authors Roos Vonk and Anouk Visser write.</p><h2>The first study to measure spiritual superiority</h2><p>No previous studies had specifically examined topic, which prompted Roos Vonk and Anouk Visser to investigate. Their <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new paper</a>, “An Exploration of Spiritual Superiority: The Paradox of Self‐Enhancement,” appears in the <em><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10990992" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">European Journal of Social Psychology</a></em>.</p><p>The authors developed a new measure they call “spiritual superiority.” It measures whether people feel superior to those “who lack the spiritual wisdom they ascribe to themselves.”<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><p>The measure’s questionnaires ask people to respond on a scale of 1 to 7 to a series of statements. Example statements include “I am more in touch with my senses than most others,” “I am more aware of what is between heaven and earth than most people,” and “The world would be a better place if others too had the insights that I have now.”</p><h2>Spiritual guidance, supernatural overconfidence, and self-worth</h2><p>The authors also created three scales that they hypothesized would correlate with spiritual superiority.</p><p>The first scale, “spiritual guidance,” relates to how much people try to help others acquire the same wisdom they have acquired. It includes statements such as “I help others whenever possible on their path to greater wisdom and insight,” “I gladly help others to acquire my insights too,” and “I am patient with others, because I understand it takes time to gain the insights that I gained in my life and my education.”</p><p>The second scale is “supernatural overconfidence,” and it encompasses self-ascribed abilities in the paranormal domain. Example statements include “I can send positive energy to others from a distance,” “I can get in touch with people who are deceased,” and “I can influence the world around me with my thoughts.”</p><p>The third scale, “spiritual contingency of self-worth,” measures how much a person’s self-esteem is derived from their spirituality. Sample statements include “My faith in myself increases when I acquire more spiritual wisdom” and “When I gain new spiritual insights, this increases my self-worth.”</p><p>In the three studies described below, the researchers found that their scale of spiritual superiority is a valid instrument. Moreover, it correlates significantly with the other three scales. It also correlates significantly with narcissism, self‐esteem, and other psychological variables. Finally, it also correlates, to varying degrees, with diverse forms of spiritual training.</p><h2><strong>Assessing spiritual superiority</strong></h2><p>For the first of the three studies included in the current paper, Vonk and Visser recruited 533 participants. They found them by contacting schools and spiritual centers that offer courses in subjects such as mindfulness and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">energetic training</a>.</p><p>The participants in this first study were about 75% female, with an average age of 51. They indicated that they were currently following some form of spiritual training. The types mentioned included <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/category/mental-health/mindfulness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mindfulness</a>, meditation, energetic therapy, reading/healing aura, haptotherapy, reiki, and others.</p><p>The respondents filled in the questionnaires described above, and also answered questions about their age, sex, education, religion, and spiritual training.</p><p>The researchers found that “spiritual superiority” correlated significantly with self-esteem, mindfulness, supernatural overconfidence, and spiritual guidance.</p><p>As the authors predicted, these correlations were strongest for participants following forms of “energetic” training. These participants rated higher than the <a href="https://amzn.to/36jmlSH" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">mindfulness/meditation</a> students on all of the superiority-related scales, especially on the scale of supernatural overconfidence.</p><p>This makes sense, the authors write, as energetic training is meant to develop supernatural skills. This likely attracts students who already believe they have talents in this area.</p><p>Likewise, the training itself might further enhance their confidence. This is because no objective performance standards can conclusively demonstrate they are not in fact paranormally gifted.</p><h2><strong>What about people who don’t follow spiritual training</strong>?</h2><p>The second study broadened the pool of respondents to include people who are not currently undergoing spiritual training. The goal was to compare their results on the spiritual superiority scale to those of the spiritual training students.</p><p>For this study, the researchers recruited 2,223 participants via a Dutch popular psychology magazine. Of these, 1960 were women. Their ages ranged from 15 to 82, with an average age of 41.</p><p>About a third had never followed any spiritual training; another third had followed mindfulness or meditation training. About 10% had followed some form of energetic training (including aura healing/reading). Another 10% had followed other kinds of spiritual training.</p><p>The result of this second study also showed that “spiritual superiority” significantly correlates with all the other measures. Furthermore, it also found the same pattern in Study 1. Namely there was a gradual increase in spiritual superiority as one moved from the “no spiritual training” group to the “mindfulness training” group to the “energetic training” group. And again, the results for the “energetic” group were much higher than for both the “mindfulness” and the “no-training” groups.</p><h2>Correlations with <strong>narcissism</strong></h2><p>Study 3 tested the hypothesis that spiritual superiority is related to narcissism. As the researchers explain, past research has used the term “spiritual narcissism,” but none those studies empirically measured it.</p><p>For this study, the authors did not measure “agentic narcissism” (for example, “I am more special than others and deserve special privileges”), but rather “<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/tech-support/201605/the-communal-narcissist-another-wolf-wearing-sheep-outfit">communal narcissism</a>,” which describes people who think of themselves as more nurturing and empathic than others. Example statements that characterize this trait include “I have a very positive influence on others” and “I am generally the most understanding person.”</p><p>This study recruited 965 participants via various channels. These included a Facebook page about psychology, spiritual schools, and participants who were not able to participate in the previous two studies due to a lack of space. The final sample included about 88% women, aged 19-79, with an average age of 46.</p><p>The participants answered the questionnaires for spiritual superiority and spiritual guidance, as well as several existing scales related to humility and overconfidence, a short 7-item version of the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22889074/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Communal Narcissism scale</a>, and a three-item self-esteem scale.</p><p>The researchers found that the correlation between spiritual superiority and narcissism was 0.47. This is significantly stronger than the correlation with self-esteem. And once again, the same pattern emerged in terms of the type of spiritual training that the participants followed. The weakest correlations were among subjects with no spiritual training, and the highest for those who practiced energetic training. The mindfulness/meditation group was in between, though it was considerably closer to the “no-training” group than to the “energetic” group.</p><h2><strong>Why t</strong>he link between <strong>spiritual superiority and narcissism</strong>?</h2><p>The authors argue that the lack of objectivity in the spiritual domain plays a role here. “Like religiosity, spirituality is a domain that seems like a safe and secure investment for self-worth,” they write. “One’s spiritual attainments allow lots of room for wishful thinking, thus easily lending themselves to the grip of the self-enhancement motive.”</p><p>And because spiritual matters are generally “elusive to external objective standards,” that makes them a “suitable domain for illusory beliefs about one’s superiority.”</p><p>The results of these three studies do not imply any casual direction; the authors suggest the causal arrow may work in both directions. On one hand, people may use spirituality as a self-esteem booster: it allows them to see themselves as special, and they can achieve progress in the spiritual domain relatively easily, as there are no objectively measurable outcomes (in contrast to, for example, sports, academic success, or wealth accumulation).</p><p>On the other hand, spiritual training may attract people who already feel superior. And the “extensive exploration of one’s personal thoughts and feelings” that spiritual training encourages “may be particularly appealing” to <a href="https://amzn.to/3lhtAhZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">narcissists</a>, the authors write.</p><h2>Towards genuine spiritual growth</h2><p>The people who agreed to take part in this research might not represent spirituality students in general. “The question is whether a truly enlightened person would even participate in our studies,” the authors write. “Would such a person be interested in or even capable of answering all these ‘me’ questions?”</p><p>GIn any case, the researchers hope that future research can “reveal more insights into the effects of spiritual training, and possibly the conditions and personality characteristics that facilitate genuine spiritual growth.”</p><hr><p><strong>Study:</strong> “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2721">An Exploration of Spiritual Superiority: The Paradox of Self‐Enhancement</a>“<br><strong>Authors: </strong>Roos Vonk and Anouk Visser<br><strong>Published in:</strong> <em><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10990992" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">European Journal of Social Psychology</a></em><br><strong>Publication date:</strong> October 1, 2020<br><strong>DOI:</strong> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ejsp.2721">https://doi.org/10.1002/ejsp.2721</a><br><strong>Photo: </strong>by <a href="https://pixabay.com/users/kalyanayahaluwo-1767926/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=5353620">Bhikku Amitha</a>&nbsp;via&nbsp;<a href="https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=5353620">Pixabay</a>&nbsp;</p><p>For a weekly summary of the latest psychology news, subscribe to our <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/the-psych-news-weekly-newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Psych News Weekly …</a></p></div></div></div></article></div>

<h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>

<p>
To most people, the Amiga is probably synonymous with the Amiga 500 and that 
machine was, above all, a video game: something into which you plonked 
3.5" floppy disks that transported you to strange, wonderful worlds and 
hours of fun. To this group, the gamers, the operating system wasn't 
important. They probably booted Workbench 1.3 
only once, took a good look at the garish blue and orange interface,
and decided that enough was enough, before going back to blasting enemies 
in Silkworm.
</p>

And why not? The machine was great for games. There are tons of great 
texts about the groundbreaking audio and video capabilities of the 
Amiga.
</p>

<p>
This text is not one of those.
</p>

<p>
This text is about the later versions of AmigaOS produced by Commodore, 
from 2.0 to 3.1. While these newer versions (with majors released in 1990 
and 1992, respectively) certainly carried the Amiga heritage with pride 
and were - mostly - backwards compatible, the advent of AmigaOS 2.0 
marked a paradigm shift. The shift is best symbolized by the fact that 
AmigaBASIC - the ubiquitous and mandatory language of any 
self-respecting eighties home computer - was ditched and replaced by 
ARexx, a professional scripting language without any kind of graphics or 
sound features whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
This paradigm shift is also why so many of us who had the good fortune 
to come across those versions clung to the Amiga so desperately. A lot
of us stuck with it
well into the late nineties, years after Commodore's demise. And we were
fierce: if 
you think Apple fanboys are annoying today, be very happy you didn't meet an 
Amiga zealot in 1995. Things got personal quickly. It was downright ugly.
</p>

<p>
I still think there were some grounds for our fanaticism, though.
</p>

<p>
In a time when home PC:s were single tasking DOS boxes with 8 character 
file names and Ataris and Macs were single tasking GUI boxes, hampering
any hacker  with their glaring lack of a CLI, the Amiga was a champion of both 
worlds: It combined the CLI and GUI, leveraging both their strengths.
But there was more to it than that, something that's hard to convey
in so many words.
</p>

<p>
Many a time have I come across exasperated Amiga users who, on some 
online forum, tries to explain the greatness of the Amiga's operating 
system in a few short sentences. It often, quite understandably, boils 
down to something akin to "It's like UNIX", which I always think is 
unfair to both of the systems.
</p>

<p>
Sure, it was an early multitasking system with a capable command line. 
At the same time, it was also a mature and coherent desktop environment 
with levels of user friendliness much more like today's MacOS X than any 
traditional UNIX. But, contrary to today's MacOS, it never mollycoddled the
end user. It opened the machine up, rather than closing certain parts off.
</p>

<p>
Unlike UNIX, AmigaOS is a system designed for home computer use, lacking a 
lot of what makes UNIX so popular: memory protection, multi user 
support, source code portability and built in networking support.
</p>

<p>
They're very much alike in one aspect, though. Like UNIX, the Amiga's 
operating system is a collection of a lot of little strokes of genius 
that come together to make it bigger than the sum of its parts.
</p>

<p>
I invite you to explore this ingenuity with me. But first, let's get the 
terminology sorted.
</p>

<h3 id="jargon">Jargon buster</h3>

<p>
The Amiga's operating system has been called a lot of things by a lot of 
people, because it consists of many components that different types of 
users interacted more or less with. Let me try to clear things up a bit:
</p>


<dl>
<dt>AmigaOS</dt>

<dd>
This was never an official name during the Commodore days, but it's a 
handy way of describing all of the components below as a whole.
</dd>

<dt>Kickstart</dt>

<dd>
This is basically the firmware of the Amiga, residing in the ROM chip. 
On version 2.0 and up, the ROM chip was 512 kB large and contained not 
only code for self tests and bootstrapping but also quite sizable 
portions of the other parts of AmigaOS.
</dd>

<dt>AmigaDOS</dt>

<dd>
This is, roughly speaking, the command line interface, device drivers, 
file system management and so on. It was originally based on TRIPOS, a 
heritage that still shows to this day. (There are newer versions of AmigaOS
than 3.1, but this text will only cover the ones released by Commodore.)
</dd>

<dt>Intuition</dt>

<dd>
Best likened to a modern desktop compositor, Intuition handles screen 
updates and manages windows. The custom sound and video chips in the 
Amiga had mostly female names (Paula, Denise and later Alice), so I 
suppose Intuition is a fitting name for an abstraction layer that lets 
the OS interface with them.
</dd>

<dt>Workbench</dt>

<dd>
This is often used interchangeably with "AmigaOS" but it's really the 
name of just the desktop environment - which is a workbench, not a 
desktop: Programs are called tools, folders a called drawers and data 
files are called projects.
</dd>

</dl>

<h4>Other terminology</h4>

<dl>

<dt>Requesters</dt>

<dd>
Not really a major part of the OS per se, a requester is the Amiga's 
name for a dialog box. A "file requester" is a file selection dialog, 
for example. I still often use this term to describe any dialog on any 
platform, much to the confusion of friends and colleagues. Old habits 
die hard.
</dd>

<dt>Devices</dt>

<dd>
Devices, much like in UNIX, usually represent peripherals attached to the 
computer, such as storage media, printers, etc. The Amiga has a number 
of built-in devices that are automatically mounted,
for example the internal floppy drive, <code>DF0:</code>
and  the serial and parallel ports, <code>SER:</code> and <code>PAR:</code>
respectively. Other 
common devices are <code>DF1:</code>, the first external floppy drive,
<code>DH0:</code>, the 
common device name given to the bootable hard drive partition, and 
<code>CON:</code>, the text console.
There are also devices that can't
be mounted but only
be accessed using programming languages, such as <code>timer.device</code>
which is used to interface with hardware clocks.
</dd>

<dt>Volumes</dt>

<dd>
Mounted devices (such as <code>DF0</code>, <code>DF1</code>, <code>DH0</code>)
can contain a volume. In the 
case of <code>DH0:</code>, a bootable hard drive partition,
the volume is fixed and 
is represented by the name of the partition, such as <code>System:</code> or 
<code>Boot:</code>.
If you insert the Deluxe Paint program disk into the internal 
floppy drive, the current volume in device <code>DF0:</code>
will be <code>DPaint:</code>.
</dd>

</dl>

</p>

<h3 id="ramdisk">The RAM Disk</h3>

<p>
The Amiga always has a RAM disk ready for use and the device name is 
always <code>RAM:</code>. No mounting, no third party software - it just sits 
there, waiting. That's clever in its own right, but the really ingenious 
part about it is that it's dynamically allocated. That means the size of the 
RAM disk corresponds to the amount of free memory currently available on 
the system, and that it never takes up more memory than is needed to
accommodate the files currently stored on it.
</p>

<p>
A RAM disk might sound esoteric today, but in the days of slow 
mechanical hard drives and floppy disks, it was a godsend for unpacking 
archives, running test compiles and storing temporary working documents.
</p>

<p>
The downside is that every time you reboot your computer, all the 
contents of the RAM disk are lost. Which brings us to...
</p>

<h3 id="raddisk">The RAD Disk</h3>

<p>
RAD, which (somehow) stands for Recoverable Ram Disk, is another 
testament to the flexibility and ingenuity of AmigaOS. The RAD disk is a 
fixed size RAM disk that can not only survive reboots but also itself
be booted from. It can be used as a small but extremely fast mini hard
drive, or  for extracting disk images to, for checking out their contents.
</p>

<h3 id="propscroll">Proportional scroll bars</h3>

<p>
A proportional scroll bar is a scroll bar that grows and shrinks to 
reflect the size of the scrollable content it represents:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://datagubbe.se/ltmag/gfxs/propscroll.png">

</p>
<p>
<i>Click the image for full resolution.</i>
</p>

<p>
Highlighting a feature like this might 
seem like a silly point to make, because today all scroll bars are 
proportional. Not so in the bad old days: Microsoft 
didn't implement them until Windows 95 and Apple, as far as I know,
didn't make the move until MacOS 9 in 1999. In a time when computer mice 
had no scroll wheels, this was a nifty feature indeed.
</p>

<h3 id="editors">The Text Editors</h3>

<p>
<a href="https://datagubbe.se/ltmag/gfxs/ed.png">
<img src="https://datagubbe.se/ltmag/gfxs/ed.png" alt="Screenshot of Ed in full screen mode.">
</a>
</p>
<p>
<i>
Above, Ed is used to edit S:Shell-Startup, the equivalent of .bashrc for
AmigaShell. The editor is currently in command mode, getting ready to delete
a line of text.

</p>

<p>
AmigaOS shipped with three different text editors: Ed, Edit and MEmacs. 
The latter is a port of, you guessed it, Micro Emacs, and will of course 
appeal to Emacs fans. The other two are sort of curiously named: Edit is 
a line editor mostly resembling ed on UNIX. The Amiga's Ed, on the other 
hand, is a full screen editor with both mouse support and an 
extensive command language. Amiga Ed is probably best likened with vi.
</p>

<p>
All three of them are capable and powerful editors. Both MEmacs and Ed 
make use of the Amiga's drop down GUI menus and feature support for 
macros and extensive configuration.
</p>

<p>
Ed's command mode is, as mentioned earlier, somewhat reminiscent of vi. 
Consider the following examples:
</p>

<p>
Change the next three occurrences of "data" to "gubbe":<br>
<code>3 E/data/gubbe/</code>
</p>

<p>
Move to top of file, repeat (RP) replace of "data" with "gubbe" until 
end of file:<br>
<code>T; RP E/data/gubbe/</code>
</p>

<p>
Move to top of file, find all occurrences of "gubbe" and insert three 
blank lines after every occurrence, repeat until end of file:<br>
<code>T; RP (F /gubbe/; 3A//)</code>
</p>

<p>
Ed also has something called an ARexx port, which completely </p></div></div>

			                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In our <a href="https://initialcommit.com/blog/Technical-Guide-VCS-Internals">Evolution of Version Control System Internals</a> post, we covered the inner workings of many version control systems, both historical and current. However, we haven't really covered <em>the possible future</em> of version control.  How will this field evolve going forward?</p>
<p>Although Git is dominant now and will certainly remain a strong player for years to come, will better tools be created? Pijul could be a strong contender.</p>
<p>In this article, we'll discuss Pijul - an alpha stage version control system that is gaining attention in the community.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p><a href="https://pijul.org/">Pijul</a> is a VCS written by Pierre-Ã‰tienne Meunier and Florent Becker. After releasing a number of experimental prototypes between 2015 and 2020, the first alpha version was released in November 2020. By operating on diffs <em>and</em> on versions at the same time, Pijul combines aspects of third-generation VCS such as <a href="https://initialcommit.com/blog/Technical-Guide-VCS-Internals#git">Git</a> and <a href="https://initialcommit.com/blog/Evolution-of-VCS-Internals-2/#darcs">Darcs</a>.</p>
<p>Pijul is written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> and is currently in alpha stage development. The algorithms and formats underlying Pijul's design were recently overhauled for performance and robustness of the system, and the team is working on making it as stable as possible after these updates.</p>
<p>Pijul's architecture and design methodology was influenced by the <a href="http://darcs.net/">Darcs</a> project, which we <a href="https://initialcommit.com/blog/Evolution-of-VCS-Internals-2/#darcs">covered in detail here</a>.</p>
<p>One distinctive feature of Pijul (shared with Darcs) is <strong>change commutation</strong>, whereby changes that could be recorded independently can be applied in any order, without affecting the result.</p>
<p>However, unlike Darcs, which operates on changes only, Pijul applies changes to an abstract data structure representing generalized files, allowing it to maintain a notion of version as well as a notion of change between versions. This has a number of advantages, in particular in terms of performance and in terms of mathematical soundness.</p>
<p>The source code for Pijul can be found at <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/pijul/pijul">https://nest.pijul.com/pijul/pijul</a>. The <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/">Pijul Nest</a> is a remote hosting platform for Pijul repositories. Think of it as Pijul's version of GitHub or BitBucket.</p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>We already have <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, the most popular and functional VCS on Earth. Git handles all of the features we could expect from a solid VCS (in fact it sets the benchmark for these features), including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intuitive method and interface for version tracking</li>
<li>Easily sharing work and collaborating remotely</li>
<li>Lightweight branching and merging</li>
<li>Fast performance and security features</li>
<li>A long list of tools for conveniently managing repositories depending on desired workflow and personal style</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have Darcs, a patch-centric perspective on version control with the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Darcs, a repository can be better thought of as a "set of patches" - applied as needed - as opposed to a linear history of dependent changesets.</li>
<li>The Darcs model preserves the <strong>identity</strong> of patches during operations like rebasing and cherry-picking, whereas Git sometimes needs to rewrite history due to chained identifiers that depend on the order of application. Preserving a change's ID can be considered a more natural approach.</li>
<li>Darcs has a very well designed interface and command set that provides verbose output to help speed up the learning curve for users and clarify what actions the users are taking.</li>
<li>Patch bundles can be easily transmitted via email to be applied by the remote repository owner.</li>
</ul>
<p>So since we have Git and Darcs, why do we need Pijul? Pijul was created to solve unrelated problems that exist in Git and Darcs.</p>
<p>Pijul uses a patch-centric model similar to Darcs, which doesn't require history to be re-written when reordering, cherry-picking, or otherwise reorganizing patches. All patches retain their identities permanently regardless of their context, order, operations performed, or team workflow. This is a very elegant solution and arguably a more natural way to create such a system. This is in contrast to Git in which certain operations such as rebases and cherry-picks can change commit ID's (and other identifiers), even if the content itself doesn't change.</p>
<p>Furthermore, subsequent cherry-picks from a remote branch in Git can lead to unnatural conflicts due to the rewriting of the initial cherry-picked commit's ID. Pijul avoids this problem completely as patches always retain their identity, regardless of their location in a branch.</p>
<p>So what about Darcs? In certain scenarios, Darcs runs into performance issues such as the <a href="http://darcs.net/FAQ/Performance#is-the-exponential-merge-problem-fixed-yet">exponential merge problem</a>. This issue causes certain merges to increase exponentially in difficulty, effectively preventing these merges from being performed. Pijul has solved this problem.</p>
<p>As is summed up nicely in <a href="https://pijul.org/posts/2020-11-07-towards-1.0#are-edge-labels-minimal">Pierre Meunier's recent post <strong>Toward's 1.0</strong></a>: "Our goals are to find the smallest possible system, both for reasons of mathematical aesthetics (why store useless stuff?) and the other one for performance."</p>
<p>Pijul's main purpose is to be an efficient VCS based on a sound mathematical theory, guaranteeing that basic properties of changes are always maintained. This consistency bolsters peace of mind in the software development process. With Pijul, developers can be 100% confident that the code they reviewed is the code that gets merged, which is not necessarily the case in Git and Mercurial. Even though file reshuffles do not seem to happen very often in these existing VCS, (and some of them are caught by tests), there are a few statistical studies highlighting their occurrence, and the security implications are huge.</p>
<p>One particular goal of Pijul is to model conflicts as normal states of collaboration, so that conflicts are resolved by normal changes, valid even for the same conflicts in any other context.</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>A Pijul repository has a <code>pristine</code> directory, containing a number of <strong>channels</strong>. At any given time, a channel contains a set of unordered <strong>changes</strong>, which can also be seen as a version, since the order of independent changes does not matter in Pijul.</p>
<p>The "working copy" is simply the set of files directly editable by the user, and the correspondence between the working copy and the pristine is done by a <strong>file tracking tree</strong>, which is just a mapping between working copy files and files as stored in the pristine.</p>
<p>Moreover, changes <strong>can</strong> (but don't need to) depend on each other, and do so explicitly (see the section about the "sample change" below), in the sense that each change is uniquely identified by its cryptographic hash, and dependencies are explicit hashes of other changes. The <strong>minimal dependencies</strong> are enforced by Pijul to make sure that text edits make sense. For example, a change editing a file or a paragraph depends on the change that introduced that file or paragraph. This is because it doesn't make sense to change a piece of content that was never added in the first place, so the patch that added the content must be present for the patch that changed it to have meaning. Additionally, the user may specify extra, language-specific dependencies to model the edits more accurately, for example the dependency between introducing a function and using it in another file or another part of the same file. This is an extremely powerful feature.</p>
<p>If desired, this scheme of dependencies between changes allows Pijul to mimic the strict sequential ordering of commits used by Git and Mercurial, turning Pijul into a sort of "Git, but with mathematically sound merges". The downside of using Pijul like this is that changes relative to independent features of the project might need to be more carefully split between different channels, like Git branches. The "plain", or "standard" Pijul way is to try and record changes that are as independent as possible, and keep them on the same channel, since independent changes can always be split later on without changing their identity (i.e. their hash). Channels are useful for different "flavors" of the project, and one can push the same changes to multiple channels without modifying these changes.</p>
<h2>Q&amp;A with the Creator</h2>
<p>We wanted to get inside the head of Pierre-Ã‰tienne Meunier, the creator and lead developer of Pijul, so we <a href="https://initialcommit.com/blog/pijul-creator">asked him a series of questions related to his background and the creation of Pijul, and the direction of the version control field</a>. His answers were <strong>extremely</strong> interesting and worth a read (we split them into a separate post since they were fairly lengthy).</p>
<h2>Basic Commands</h2>
<p>One of Pijul's goals is to minimize the number of commands, so as to allow users to get a full understanding of the system as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The commands are:</p>
<p><code>pijul init</code>: Creates a directory named <code>.pijul</code>, containing the following structure:</p>
<div>
    <pre><code>.pijul/
    changes
    config
    pristine
        db0
        db.lock</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Here, the meaningful things that get created are <code>db0</code>, which contains the pristine, in binary format, and a sample <code>config</code> file, editable in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML">TOML format</a>.</p>
<p><code>pijul add &lt;filename.ext&gt;</code>: Adds a file to the repository's tracking list.<br>
<code>pijul remove &lt;filename.ext&gt;</code>:  Remove a file from the tracking list.<br>
<code>pijul mv &lt;filename1.ext&gt; &lt;filename2.ext&gt;</code>: Move and/or rename a file in the tracking list.<br>
<code>pijul ls</code>: Displays a list of currently tracked files.<br>
<code>pijul record</code> (or <code>pijul rec</code>): Creates a change and applies it to the pristine. Once we do that, the <code>.pijul/changes</code> gets populated with one change:</p>
<div>
    <pre><code>./
    file
    .pijul/
        changes
            ZN
                PGE4DJNVY4JAQABNSQYVF5LBFWNO6FRJI3LXX7E7EB4Y3NGGGQC.change
        config
        pristine
            db0
            db.lock</code></pre>
</div>
<p><code>pijul unrecord &lt;hash&gt;</code>: If no change depends on a change <code>hash</code>, we can also "undo" or "unapply" it using the <code>unrecord</code> command. For example, here our change's hash is <code>ZNPGE4DJNVY4JAQABNSQ...</code>, and we can use any unambiguous prefix of that hash, for example <code>pijul unrecord ZNPG</code>, or even <code>pijul unrecord Z</code> to undo it.<br>
<code>pijul reset</code>: Resets the repository to the state of a channel. Without any …</p></div></div></div>

I bet many of you would have faced a similar issue at one time or another. I will also try to state the problem better by defining the requirements of an ideal file sharing app and what technologies can plausibly help in building it. </p>
<p>So, recently I bought a new phone and I wanted to transfer all the files and folders (around 40GB) from my old phone to my windows laptop. Anyone would immediately think of connecting a USB cable and copying files. But my old phone has USB port issues, leaving me with the only wireless transfer. Well, with all the advancements in wireless technology it should be straightforward, right? I am not sure if I did it correctly, at least my experience was horrible.</p>
<p>I started searching for different options I have available to transfer wirelessly. These are what I came up with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloud Drives</strong>: But it doesn't make sense for me to buy a subscription just for transferring 40GB of data. I want a way to transfer not to backup. So I discarded this option.</li>
<li><strong>Wi-Fi Direct:</strong> I installed  <a target="_blank" href="https://superbe.am/">Superbeam </a> - a popular Wi-Fi Direct app, and tried to transfer from my phone to my laptop. But transfer rates are very slow and connection keeps breaking, I have to start from the beginning every time. After many failed retries and after trying out other Wi-Fi Direct apps with the same problems, I gave up.</li>
<li><strong>FTP</strong>: I got fed up with all these apps and relied back on the standard FTP. Started an FTP server on my phone using  <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.solidexplorer2">Solid File Explorer</a>  and downloaded the files from my laptop. Even with this, transfer rates are slow but better than Wi-Fi Direct. And I faced similar connection drop issues. After a few tries somehow managed to transfer all the files.</li>
</ul>
<p>After all this struggle, I started researching more to see if this is a real issue faced by everyone or just me. And I was surprised by the number of results I found on Hackernews, Reddit, and Quora. I found many queries where people kept asking "What are the best ways to transfer files from platform X to platform Y?" and many questions similar to that. It is quite clear that I am not alone. But the bad part is there is no standard solution. There are different apps available to solve this on different platforms but I failed to find a universal solution.  <a target="_blank" href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a>  is the best solution that comes very close to my requirements. Haven't tested the transfer rates but I presume it should be equivalent to network bandwidth.</p>
<p>But I was not able to digest the fact that even in 2020 where all devices are wireless, I still need to install app or software on different devices to transfer files between them. Isn't transferring files or documents across devices is the primary reason why LAN/Internet is invented? Why do I need to fiddle with different software to achieve that? And, any non-technical person wouldn't be interested in installing software and setting them up, they will just go grab the USB cables and transfer.</p>
<p>Disappointed me started listing down the requirements of an ideal file/data transfer app, and it goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ubiquitous and available on all platforms.</li>
<li>Requires minimal or no setup/installation. If I want to transfer a file to a friend who doesn't have it set up, we shouldn't be wasting more time in setting up than transferring the actual file.</li>
<li>Use the internet only when needed, if transferring between devices on the same network, my transfer speeds shouldn't be dependent on my internet bandwidth.</li>
<li>Be fast, like really fast, utilize the entire bandwidth.</li>
<li>Able to transfer any file, directory, or just a simple text message (like clipboard data).</li>
<li>Option to pause or resume when transferring large files, Handle connection issues reliably, and auto-retry on network failure without human intervention.</li>
<li>Transfer via a secure channel. At least it shouldn't be like anyone can easily sniff the data that is being transferred.</li>
<li>Simple and intuitive. No bloat. No account setup. Any layman should be able to use the app without any trouble.</li>
<li>And last but not the least, it should be free and open-source, which means no intermediate servers, preferably peer to peer.</li>
<li>Bonus: Transfer to multiple devices at once. An option to broadcast to all devices in the network.</li>
</ol>
<p>After noting down the requirements, especially the first two points, I quickly realized, this is possible if it is a web app, right? Browsers are available on every device, and web apps do not require any setup. And I am not the only one who realized this, many developers have already tried to solve this through a web app (<a target="_blank" href="https://snapdrop.net/">Snapdrop</a>,  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sharedrop.io/">ShareDrop</a>), but they don't meet other requirements quite well, specifically directory sharing and pause/resume option which are deal-breakers when transferring large files.</p>
<p>I started exploring how these existing apps work in the hope to extend them. The underlying technology that makes it possible to transfer files via browsers is  <a target="_blank" href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a>. It is a p2p protocol and an API that is available in all modern browsers. With my current understanding and research, I believe one can build a web app that satisfies the above-mentioned requirements using WebRTC. Transfer rates might not be super fast but we can achieve decent rates. I began to learn how WebRTC works and working on how feasible it is to build this app. Will keep posting my updates and progress in this blog.</p>
<p>Do let me know in the comments if there is an existing app that satisfies the requirements mentioned so that I am not reinventing the wheel. Also, let me know your opinion on having WebRTC as a base technology, Do you think we can solve this never-ending problem of wireless file transfer with WebRTC? If not which technology/protocol do you think fits this problem well?</p>

<p><em>Or the real reason Twitter doesn't want you to have an edit button.</em></p>

<p>
I'll try to leave the pulp in here and keep this as chronological as I can. In that spirit, no tweets were harmed in the making of this post.
</p>

<p>
The original idea to make a tweet that quote tweets itself is from the 28<sup>th</sup> of May 2020—as recorded in Evernote—but I think had likely occurred to me earlier when considering what ramifications Twitter having an edit button would have—most notably being able to mislead, being able to vandalize someone's timeline post-retweet, and of course being able to edit your tweet to refer to itself.
</p>

<p>
Fundamentally the challenge is just correctly guessing what ID a given tweet is going to get, then appending that onto the URL for our profile and tweeting it.</p>

<p>
This initial note already had some background research done into determining how tweet IDs were generated, with a link to <a href="https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2019/08/2019-08-03-tweetedat-finding-tweet.html">this article containing a useful breakdown of Twitter's Snowflake IDs</a>, so thanks to the author of that, Nauman Siddique.
</p>

<h3>Anatomy of a tweet ID</h3>
<p>
Twitter used to use sequential IDs but no longer do.
Public-facing sequential IDs have the drawback of making usage of your platform easy to estimate.
They are also hard to generate in a distributed fashion while preserving order.
</p>

<p>
From the link above we find that the new Twitter IDs (used for more than just tweets—for example, lists) are composed of three parts: a timestamp, a machine ID, and a sequence number, arranged like so:
</p>

<code><pre>TIMESTAMP MACHINE ID SEQUENCE NUM
41 BITS   10 BITS    12 BITS
000...000 0000000000 000000000000 
</pre></code>

<p>
These are then just stuck together and interpreted as a decimal number and look something like 1320553050730340354.
</p>

<p>
Brute-forcing the whole thing is not going to work here as there are so many possibilities, but thankfully the largest section is the timestamp, which should be easy enough to guess correctly.
This will likely just involve finding the delay between my program guessing an ID and Twitter assigning an ID to the generated tweet.
There will always be fluctuations here as we're dealing in milliseconds and both my computer and all of Twitter's system will be under varying loads.
However, it should be somewhat consistent, at least within a given timeframe.
Hopefully then we can just figure the other two out as they are much smaller—having only 1024 and 4096 possibilities, compared to the timestamp's over 2 trillion (that's a lot of milliseconds).
</p>

<p>
I knew I'd likely have to do <em>some</em> spamming as I was not going to get it right on the first go, so I created a new account to spare my few but wonderful followers.
</p>

<h3>Why the name?</h3>
<p>
From Wikipedia:<br>
<em>
A quine is a computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output.
</em></p>
<p>
So it's only natural that a quinetweet would print its own URL, and thus hopefully quote tweet or retweet itself.
And naturally I set the profile photo to one of Quine himself, and the banner to a relevant Escher lithograph.
</p>


<h3>Tweeting with the API</h3>
<p>
I signed the new profile up for a <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/">developer account</a> to start tweeting programatically using Twitter's API. And began with their examples using <a href="https://github.com/twitter/twurl">twurl</a>.
</p>

<p>The first step is authorization with my shiny new API keys:</p>
<code><pre>twurl authorize --consumer-key CONSUMER_KEY \
                --consumer-secret CONSUMER_SECRET
</pre></code>

<p>And now we can get straight into tweeting:</p>
<code><pre>twurl -d 'status=Test tweet using the POST statuses/update endpoint' /1.1/statuses/update.json
</pre></code>
<p>Resulting in our beautiful first tweet:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Test tweet using the POST statuses/update endpoint</p>— quinetweet (@quinetweet) <a href="https://twitter.com/quinetweet/status/1308911113229209601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>In the returned response there is quite a lot of information, but we only really care about the ID, in this case 1308911113229209601 which thankfully matches up with what shows up on Twitter's website—they're not lying!</p>

<p>Okay, so now let's quote tweet the previous tweet:</p>

<code><pre>twurl -d 'status=https://twitter.com/quinetweet/status/1308911113229209601' /1.1/statuses/update.json
</pre></code>

<p>Beautiful! I can almost taste the recursion already.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/FXps7y4yMw">https://t.co/FXps7y4yMw</a></p>— quinetweet (@quinetweet) <a href="https://twitter.com/quinetweet/status/1308912279853903872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>Now to investigate the behaviour of the various components of the ID, let's do two tweets in quick succession, using a simple Bash loop:</p>

<code><pre>for i in {1..2}; do twurl -d 'status=Quick succession test' /1.1/statuses/update.json; done
</pre></code>

<p>
To which we're met with a warning from Twitter about the second attempt being a duplicate—so apparently Twitter do have <em>some</em> protection against unoriginality.
</p>

<p>
No worries, simply adding a variable should fix this:
</p>

<code><pre>for i in {1..2}; do twurl -d 'status=Quick succession test <span>$i</span>' /1.1/statuses/update.json; done
</pre></code>

<p>
Oh no! This is also getting the same duplicate warning, what's going on?
Let's check Twitter:
</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Quick succession test <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24i&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$i</a></p>— quinetweet (@quinetweet) <a href="https://twitter.com/quinetweet/status/1309237764035051520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>
How embarrassing—we've accidentally linked to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelsat">Intelsat</a>'s stock ticker!
We should have used double quotes:
</p>

<code><pre>for i in {1..2}; do twurl -d <span>"</span>status=Quick succession test $i<span>"</span> /1.1/statuses/update.json; done
</pre></code>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Quick succession test 1</p>— quinetweet (@quinetweet) <a href="https://twitter.com/quinetweet/status/1309237975868469248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Quick succession test 2</p>— quinetweet (@quinetweet) <a href="https://twitter.com/quinetweet/status/1309237977982345216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>Finally! Now we can say we're programatically tweeting without completely lying.</p>

<p>
Okay now let's take a look at these last two IDs, splitting them into timestamp, machine ID, and sequence number:
</p>

<code><pre>1309237975868469248 -&gt; (312146657912, 375, 0)
1309237977982345216 -&gt; (312146658416, 362, 0)
</pre></code>

<p>
We see the second was posted 504&nbsp;ms after the first (from Twitter's point of view), the machine IDs differ by 13, and both the sequence numbers are 0. We might be able to get away with assuming the sequence number is most commonly 0. This is great news because it was the larger of the two non-timestamp components so greatly reduces the number of checks we'll have to make. The range for our brute forcing looks like it might be small enough after all!</p>

<p>While Bash was great to start off with, I'm more comfortable with Python, so...</p>

<h2>Let's start guessing some IDs</h2>
<p>I'm just going to post the final code here with a brief description of each function. I'm sure there are numerous ways the code could be improved (for one it should probably take the machine ID and other guesswork bits as arguments).</p>

<h3>tweet_id_from_timestamp</h3>
<p>This does roughly what it says on the tin, and was created by simply reversing the get_tweet_timestamp function that was helpfully shared in <a href="https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2019/08/2019-08-03-tweetedat-finding-tweet.html">the article mentioned in the intro</a>, including Twitter's timestamp OFFSET that they had already worked out.</p>

<h3>tweet_id_to_parts</h3>
<p>This gets a tweet id and splits it up into the parts described above: the timestamp, machine ID, and sequence number.

</p><h3>compare_ids</h3>
<p>To see how badly off our guesses are, we'll need a function to compare the ID we guessed to the one Twitter actually assigned. While it might seem like a tweet ID is just one number and you might think you could just subtract the two to compare them, due to the nature of how they are created simply being off by one millisecond and getting everything else right would be lead your guess to be off by several million. For this reason it makes more sense to compare the individual parts so that is what we do here.</p>

<h3>guess_tweet_id</h3>
<p>Again, a simply named function that guesses a tweet ID based on the time it is called and another time offset and machine ID. Note here that we don't do anything about the sequence number as it was usually zero so there's not much point guessing anything else.</p>

<h3>guess</h3>
<p>This function actually does the posting of the tweets and will guess N different tweets in quick succession with the same time offset and machine ID. I kept N low enough so I could manually change the offsets and if they were very far off I wouldn't eat into the rate limit too much.</p>



<p>A non-gist version of the code is on Github <a href="https://github.com/OisinMoran/quinetweet/blob/main/quinetweet.py">here</a>.</p>

<h2>An idea that didn't work</h2>
<p>While manually adjustment of the offsets and machine ID was getting me kind of close, I thought it could be even better to do that automatically. If these values were time-sensitive, a program would be able to update them much faster than I could. I tried to do this by updating based on the mean error of the previous several responses, but this ended up not really working (maybe the median or mode would fare better here). It ended up being easier to just eyeball the differences and pick something reasonable, though I'm not entirely sure if I explicitly know—even now—what I was doing.</p>


<h2>Shit gets weird</h2>
<p>With that all done, I began the sport of just letting it run in short bursts until the rate limit (300 tweets per 3 hour window) forced me to go do something else. Who knew rate limits could be such an effective public health measure?</p>

<p>A strange and completely unexpected thing began to happen. In these quiet hours of the internet, some of the attempted self-quotes started linking to tweets from other accounts, mostly in South America and Japan! What was going on? All of the guessed URLs had the quinetweet account name hardcoded into them, so why and how were they linking to other tweets?</p>

<blockquote><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/OOUKS9dwCp">https://t.co/OOUKS9dwCp</a></p>— quinetweet (@quinetweet) <a href="https://twitter.com/quinetweet/status/1309684115017527297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>That is most certainly not my account. So what did we actually <em>try</em> to tweet here and what did it link to? Conveniently both of our accounts have ten character names so the URLs line up nicely in a monospaced font which makes visually comparing them even easier than normal.</p>

<code><pre>https://twitter.com/quinetweet/status/1309684114073808896
https://twitter.com/gzhdigital/status/1309684114073808896
</pre></code>

<p>Okay, wild! We guessed someone else's tweet ID! And as the IDs are time-dependent that means they were met with an instantaneous retweet—creepy. Also, it seems like Twitter doesn't actually care about the username and just resolves URLs based on the tweet ID. I'm sure lots of people already knew that but it's new to me.</p>

<p>Let's try another, this time from the Pope: <a href="https://twitter.com/Pontifex/status/1107421599333007362">https://twitter.com/Pontifex/status/1107421599333007362</a></p>
<p>Okay this is pretty interesting, but back to the task at …</p></div>

<p>In this essay, we take a detailed look into the sub-optimality of LRU and how one of its variants called 2Q addresses and improves upon it. 2Q algorithm was first introduced in the paper - <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2Q%3A-A-Low-Overhead-High-Performance-Buffer-Johnson-Shasha/5fa357b43c8351a5d8e7124429e538ad7d687abc">2Q: A low overhead high-performance buffer management replacement algorithm</a> by Theodore Johnson and Dennis Shasha.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)">LRU eviction algorithm</a> evicts the page from the buffer which has not been accessed for the longest. LRU is typically implemented using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list">Doubly Linked List</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">Hash Table</a>. The intuition of this algorithm is so strong and implementation is so simple that until the early '80s, LRU was the algorithm of choice in nearly all the systems. But as stated above, there are certain situations where LRU performs sub-optimal.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/100534745-43ae8400-3238-11eb-8855-752a6ef2f3c6.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/100534745-43ae8400-3238-11eb-8855-752a6ef2f3c6.png"></p>
<h2>Sub-optimality during DB scans</h2>
<p>If the database table is bigger than the LRU cache, the DB process, upon scanning the table will wipe out the entire LRU cache and fill it with the pages from just one scanned table. If these pages are not referenced again, this is a total loss and the performance of the database takes a massive hit. The performance will pickup once these pages are evicted from the cache and other pages make an entry.</p>
<h2>Sub-optimality in evictions</h2>
<p>LRU algorithm works with a single dimension - recency - as it removes the pages from the buffer on the basis of recent accesses. Since it does not really consider any other factor, it can actually evict a warmer page and replace it with a colder one - a page that could and would be accessed just once.</p>

<p>2Q addresses the above-illustrated issues by introducing parallel buffers and supporting queues. Instead of considering just recency as a factor, 2Q also considers access frequency while making the decision to ensure the page that is really warm gets a place in the LRU cache. It admits only hot pages to the main buffer and tests every page for a second reference.</p>
<p>The golden rule that 2Q is based on is - <em>Just because a page is accessed once does not entitle it to stay in the buffer. Instead, it should be decided if it is accessed again then only keep it in the buffer.</em></p>
<p>Below we take a detailed look into two versions of the 2Q algorithm - simplified and improved.</p>
<h2>Simplified 2Q</h2>
<p>Simplified 2Q algorithm works with two buffers: the primary LRU buffer - <code>Am</code>  and a secondary FIFO buffer - <code>A1</code>. New faulted pages first go to the secondary buffer <code>A1</code> and then when the page is referenced again, it moves to the primary LRU buffer <code>Am</code>. This ensures that the page that moves to the primary LRU buffer is hot and indeed requires to be cached.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/100536835-41a0f100-3249-11eb-920b-0bcaff905906.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/100536835-41a0f100-3249-11eb-920b-0bcaff905906.png"></p>
<p>If the page residing in <code>A1</code> is never referenced again, it eventually gets discarded, implying the page was indeed cold and did not deserve to be cached. Thus this simplified 2Q provides protection against the two listed sub-optimality of the simple LRU scheme by adding a secondary buffer and testing pages for a second reference. The pseudocode for the Simplified 2Q algorithm is as follows:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>access_page</span><span>(X: page)</span>:</span>
    
    
    <span>if</span> X <span>in</span> Am:
         Am.move_front(X)

    
    
    
    
    <span>elif</span> X <span>in</span> A1:
         A1.remove(X)
         Am.add_front(X)

    
    <span>else</span>:
         
         <span>if</span> A1.is_full():
             A1.pop()

         
         A1.add_front(X)
</code></pre>
<p>Tuning Simplified 2Q buffer is difficult - if the maximum size of <code>A1</code> is too small, the test for hotness becomes too strong and if it is too large then due to memory constraint <code>Am</code> will get relatively smaller memory making the primary LRU cache smaller, eventually degrading the database performance.</p>
<p>The full version 2Q algorithm remediates this limitation and eliminates tuning to a massive extent without taking any hit in performance.</p>
<h2>2Q Full Version</h2>
<p>Although Simplified 2Q algorithm does a decent job there is still scope of improvement when it comes to handling common database access pattern, that suggests, a page generally receives a lot of references for a short period of time and then no reference for a long time. If a page truly needs to be cached then after it receives a lot (not just one) of references in a short span it continues to receive references and hits on regular intervals.</p>
<p>To handle this common database access pattern, the 2Q algorithm splits the secondary buffer <code>A1</code> into two buffers <code>A1-In</code> and <code>A1-Out</code>, where the new element always enters <code>A1-In</code> and continues to stay in <code>A1-In</code> till it gets accesses ensuring that the most recent first accesses happen in the memory.</p>
<p>Once the page gets old, it gets thrown off the memory but its disk reference is stored in the <code>A1-Out</code> buffer. If the page, whose reference is, residing in <code>A1-Out</code> is accessed again the page is promoted to <code>Am</code> LRU implying it indeed is a hot page that will be accessed again and hence required to be cached.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/100538168-0bb53a00-3254-11eb-8f69-ddcaf8d33a84.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/100538168-0bb53a00-3254-11eb-8f69-ddcaf8d33a84.png"></p>
<p>The <code>Am</code> buffer continues to be the usual LRU which means when any page residing in <code>Am</code> is accessed it is moved to the head and when a page is needed to be discarded the eviction happens from the tail end.</p>

<p>Postgres uses 2Q as its cache management algorithm due to <a href="http://www.varlena.com/GeneralBits/96.php">patent issues</a> with IBM. Postgres used to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_replacement_cache">ARC</a> as its caching algorithm but with IBM getting a patent over it, Postgres moved to 2Q. Postgres also claims that the performance of 2Q is similar to ARC.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure id="w-node-184f6be698e4-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5fc36150f7e15501838a699f_3C877AnDdlSJbqfxjZakSrkuQ6NuM0CNdqLoQvUNkeH3u3ScA-BmwT0Qbkb0NsFSDoElP6iR-iS4zhQ-QNa_cEMzBQ0XbHk6xsMTaU1EypUH-XFO7m_sywyykBR2iA_6wc4QMQHL.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>A very common challenge faced by many software products is the need for the application server to communicate with other third party application servers. To be more specific, my application server needs to be notified when a particular event takes place in a 3rd party application server.<br></p><p>For instance, I am currently building a <a href="https://www.delightchat.io/" target="_blank">customer support software</a> in which customer queries can come from various channels of communication including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. This means that if someone sends a message on Facebook messenger, that message has to ultimately reach my application server in some way so I can perform the necessary operations.<br></p><p>The most common way to solve this problem is with the use of webhooks.<br></p><h3><strong>What is a webhook?</strong><br></h3><p>A webhook is nothing but an API end point that is created in your own application server which is made public and it is called by other applications to provide your application with real time updates for various events.<br></p><p>The product that I am currently building integrates with Shopify and every time somebody places an order on a merchants Shopify store, my application needs to be notified in real time so that the order can be indexed in my database and my application then has the capability to query all orders placed by a particular user.<br></p><p>To solve this, I would have to create an API end point on my server in the form of <em>/webhooks/shopify/orders/create</em> and register this URL with Shopify. Whenever Shopify receives a new order in their system, their server will fire this URL along with the order data.<br></p><h3><strong>How to inspect a webhook?</strong><br></h3><p>Since a webhook is called from a 3rd party server that is out of your control, you have no way of knowing what kind of data will be sent in the webhook unless you actually create an API, host it somewhere that is public and register the endpoint with the 3rd party software. <br></p><p>If this seems like a lot of work just to view the contents of a webhook, products like <a href="https://requestbin.com/" target="_blank">requestbin</a> and <a href="https://beeceptor.com/" target="_blank">beecepter</a> were built exactly for this purpose. You can get a free endpoint from these products and register it in the 3rd party software after which you can trigger the event you are looking for and view the contents of the request on their dashboard.<br></p><p>However I believe in simplicity and these services come with their own set of constraints. So after a little bit of research I found that the netcat utility that is installed by default In most UNIX based machines solves this problem quite elegantly.<br></p><h5>Using netcat to inspect a webhook<br></h5><p>In the most simplest form, you can set up a webhook listener with a simple terminal command<br></p><p>&lt;p&gt;CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/b0a8efaad418feeae02e4285582e2ce5.js&lt;/p&gt;<br></p><p>This command will listen for any requests coming on the port 3000 and display it on the terminal itself. Let us try it out by entering <a href="http://localhost:8000/my/webhook/path" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000/my/webhook/path</a> on the browser and see what happens.<br></p><figure id="w-node-060a8fc15179-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5fc34225f58539412e8fad89_gN3PHr5rIsoV-eU02OEnVfFRqw10WcvJV73B2eTxDnL1IanCGiOyMGuomBwxTo7LJV2QmqfyFgSYRT5cNlIIK-YsdFC3Pt8k4U_vmrVt65rlvqVDok1o44yR-_rKqVr0YGLXKV8U.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Inspecting the contents of a http request<br></figcaption></figure><p>The output on the terminal contains the entire http request that was received by localhost:3000 including the http method, headers and content. But there are two clear problems here:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>The browser keeps waiting for a response from the netcat server which is never received, so it eventually times out.</li><li>The netcat server displays the webhook request and then shuts down after which it will no longer accept any more requests unless you re-run the command.<br></li></ul><p>Both of these problems have simple solutions. Let’s go through them in order.<br></p><h5><strong>Returning a response</strong> <br></h5><p>One can easily create a simple HTTP message and return that as the response to the requests made to this netcat server. Here is how you do it:<br></p><p>Create a file called response.txt with these contents.<br></p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/0753a1ac3a4442eedb3c0f811740e4ec.js &lt;/p&gt;<br></p><p>Echo the contents of this file and pipe the netcat command to it.<br></p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/5fffa3d857bab441dd85fad1061da384.js &lt;/p&gt;<br></p><p>Now upon hitting localhost:3000 on your browser, you will receive a response in the browser.</p><figure id="w-node-7c8443ed0138-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5fc342e7f19477bb7649ae48_Wxi5VFUp0fleE1u1NrVneah1s_TxVNEXXKaXw092dB-lfc3M7ljNOgoTIp0uvn8WiEZT071uf0P4vNbTQcrknLXckCJGsShTHzmMEoxUJ39O9rvCIfqbbUDtXnBSH67vAy2-X6wv.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>netcat server with response</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h5>Running the netcat server in a loop<br></h5><p>To prevent the netcat server from shutting down after a request is received, all we have to do is run the commands in a loop. This can be done with a small modification to the above command.</p><p>‍<br>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/eb8413365d91e566c66e456adffbf6c3.js &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>Now when you make a request to localhost:3000, the request content will be displayed on the terminal and a response will be sent to the client making the request but the netcat server will continue to run and accept new requests.<br></p><p>To demonstrate the fact that you can inspect any http request using this setup, let us make another request to localhost:3000 but this time use a PUT method with some query parameters, some headers and some data using cURL.</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/1468715b5fbe8c97bae095e874200cef.js &lt;/p&gt;<br></p><figure id="w-node-e056beb644f0-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5fc343941c29737cf9f65b15_hq7ITM8kEJRvb5wm5yDYvA-sno9OUgLRFw_tb3r3OKuL1PpeAfl68wPSHrhu4YTTmI79qNO_viY6rGyqoLk5c15mO5J6syZOBRCG1WUCyHs2-QHyP-a0e4KIxEpaiNsa80HJ9_TX.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Viewing the contents of a PUT request with headers, query params and body</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Great! we can now inspect any type of webhook that is made to localhost:3000.<br></p><h3>Making your webhook public using ngrok<br></h3><p>Now that we have a fake server setup using netcat that is capable of accepting requests, displaying their content and sending back a valid response, all we need is a method to expose this server to the public internet. <br></p><p>This is because, we need to register this webhook on some third party software like Shopify and that cannot be done unless the URL is publicly accessible. <br></p><p>Fortunately, this can be done with a single command using ngrok. Ngrok is a very nifty tool that lets you expose a service running on localhost to the public internet by generating a temporary URL that is made public. You can also get a permanent URL by signing up for their paid plan.<br></p><p>After installing ngrok from <a href="https://ngrok.com/download" target="_blank">here</a> and unzipping it as shown in the description, all you have to do is run this command on a new terminal window while your netcat server is still running.</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/4c4018e45ed36130521bcfd63a89b0c3.js &lt;p&gt;<br></p><p>You instantly get a http and https endpoint that routes traffic from the public internet to localhost:3000.

        <time datetime="2020-11-29">November 29, 2020</time>
<p>In this post I’ll describe how to use <a href="">Pandoc</a> to convert Markdown to a full HTML page (including header/footer).</p>
<p>The Pandoc version used for the examples below is 2.11.2.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-pandoc">What is Pandoc?</h2>
<p>Pandoc is an open-source document converter that is written in Haskell. It was initially released in 2006 and has been under active development since then.</p>
<p>The goal of Pandoc is to convert a document from one markup format to another. It distinguishes between input formats and output formats. As of writing this it supports <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#input-formats">38 input formats</a> and <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#output-formats">59 output formats</a>.</p>
<p>In this post we’ll use Markdown as an input format and HTML as an output format.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-the-html-template">Preparing the HTML template</h2>
<p>To generate a full HTML page we have to use Pandoc’s standalone mode which will use a <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#templates">template</a> to add header and footer.</p>
<p>Pandoc ships with a default template, if you wish to use that skip this section and omit the <code>--template</code> argument.</p>
<p>The template we’ll use is this (save it to <code>template.html</code>):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="date" content='$date-meta$'&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;$title$&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Date: $date$&lt;/p&gt;
$body$
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Pandoc’s template variables can have <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#interpolated-variables">different formats</a>, the one we’re using here start and end with a dollar sign:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$date$</code>: A date in a parsable format. See the <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#variables-set-automatically">date-meta docs</a> for a list of recognized formats for the <code>date</code> variable. We use this to show when the document was created</li>
<li><code>$date-meta$</code>: The <code>date</code> parsed to ISO 8601 format. This is automatically done</li>
<li><code>$title$</code>: The document title</li>
<li><code>$body$</code>: The document body in HTML (the converted Markdown)</li>
</ul>
<p>We only need to set the <code>date</code> and <code>title</code> in the Markdown document via a metadata block.</p>
<h2 id="writing-the-markdown-file">Writing the Markdown file</h2>
<p>Create a Markdown file <code>doc.md</code> with the following content:</p>
<pre><code>---
title: My Document
date: September 22, 2020
---

## Test
some text</code></pre>
<p>The beginning of the document is the metadata block with required <code>date</code> and <code>title</code> variables mentioned above.</p>
<p>Several Markdown variants are <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#Markdown-variants">supported</a> such as GitHub-Flavored markdown. This example uses <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown">Pandoc’s extended markdown</a> which is the default input for files with the <code>md</code> extension.</p>
<h2 id="converting-the-document">Converting the document</h2>
<p>Run the following command to generate the HTML page:</p>
<pre><code>pandoc --standalone --template template.html doc.md</code></pre>
<p>Pandoc will try to guess the input format from the file extension (<code>.md</code> will use the Markdown input format) and output it to HTML (the default output format).</p>
<p>The output will be printed to the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="date" content='2020-09-22'&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My Document&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Date: September 22, 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="test"&gt;Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;some text&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>To save the document to a file we can either redirect stdout or use the <code>-o</code> argument:</p>
<pre><code>pandoc --standalone --template template.html doc.md -o doc.html</code></pre>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this example we’ve converted Markdown to a standalone HTML page that is using a custom template.</p>
<p>This was just a simple example of what Pandoc is capable to do. The standalone mode coupled with the bundled default templates makes it easy to generate a wide variety of outputs such as HTML presentations, Jupyter notebooks or PDF documents.</p>

      <h3>May 31, 2013</h3>
      
      
      <p><img loading="lazy" alt="Skeuo-flat-ic design" src="http://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/skeuflat.jpg" width="1279" height="461" srcset="https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/skeuflat.jpg 1279w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/skeuflat-300x108.jpg 300w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/skeuflat-554x200.jpg 554w" sizes="(max-width: 1279px) 100vw, 1279px"></p>
<p>I don’t remember exactly where I first encountered it. But at some point in the past three years, I, along with a large contingent of user interface designers, fans, and industry followers, learned a new word: Skeuomorphic. A skeuomorph in the UI world, so the popular definition goes (even if the rigorous scientific definition of the word <a href="http://www.themachinestarts.com/read/2012-11-how-we-started-calling-visual-metaphors-skeuomorphs-why-apple-design-debate-mess">makes “skeuomorphic design” an oxymoron</a>) is&nbsp;a GUI or elements of a GUI that borrow from a physical analog of their functionality. It seemed like a useful concept in defining the execution of user interfaces, with an added benefit of sounding exotic in conversation – but I think we may have outgrown it.</p>
<h3>Everyone loves a feud</h3>
<p>Somewhere along the way, this newly-popularized concept gained that one thing critical to capturing our collective imagination: a foil. Where skeuomorphism was tied to the familiar, the tactile, the rich, the warm, this dark horse was divorced of the familiar, lived in platonic ideals, was simple, cold, mathematic. Despite drawing most of its theory from the 20th Century’s signature design movement, <a href="http://www.citrinitas.com/history_of_viscom/modernists.html">Modernism</a>, it was nonetheless given its own, rather less impressive (and more prescriptive) name, “<a href="http://designmodo.com/flat-design-principles/">flat design</a>.”</p>
<p>As the story goes, each of these poles had its champion, with Apple raising the varnished-oak banner of its increasingly unified mobile and desktop design language, and Microsoft carrying the solid, rectilinear flag of what was briefly but indelibly called its Metro design language. A war was brewing in the UI design world between flat and skeu: Apple’s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/24/jony-ives-ios-7-flat-design-overhaul-reportedly-features-a-lot-of-black-and-white/">rumored “move to flat”</a> would stir more design-office conversation than a betrayal in Game of Thrones.</p>
<h3>Not so flat</h3>
<p>There is a problem with this narrative. Much of the interaction that users have with iOS devices is with UI elements having no physical analogs apart from the most basic, localized physical metaphor, the button – most of these are even just <a href="http://i.imgur.com/kIFUHwM.png">black Helvetica on a white background</a>. And for all of Microsoft’s eschewing of texture, shading, and object references, one cannot escape that its many boxes and encircled icons ultimately draw affordance from our associations with a physical object, the humble pushbutton.</p>
<p>So if much of iOS is “flat,” and Windows Phone is loaded with a thousand tiny skeuomorphs, what are we left with? An important realization: “Flat design” is not nearly as flat as it looks. Skeuomorphism is a critical part of interaction design, and is everywhere.</p>
<p>How, then, do we verbalize the many clear differences between the examples of iOS and Windows Phone? The answer is to build a more nuanced framework than “flat” versus “skeuomorphism.”</p>
<h3>Building a more useful vocabulary</h3>
<p>Instead of imagining a fun-to-follow, yet ultimately empty battle between the forces of skeuomorphism and flat design, a more productive pursuit would be to construct a vocabulary around the toolset these concepts offer. Here are a few tools I see:</p>
<h4>Functional object reference (“skeuomorphism”)</h4>
<div id="attachment_413"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-413" loading="lazy" alt="object" src="http://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/object.jpg" width="768" height="215" srcset="https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/object.jpg 768w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/object-300x83.jpg 300w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/object-614x171.jpg 614w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-413">Propellerhead Reason, Apple Calendar, Microsoft Windows Phone 8 dialer</p></div>
<p>This is the sort of visual metaphor that ties an object from the physical world to a virtual tool. Ideally it is for purposes of building affordance from familiarity (turning pages in iBooks), but it can easily be misused (non-functional pages in iOS Address Book). Regardless of how realistically it’s rendered, a physical object can be useful as a reference so long as it is recognizable by the user and responds in the same way.</p>
<h4>Material/texture reference</h4>
<div id="attachment_414"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-414" loading="lazy" alt="texture" src="http://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/texture.jpg" width="768" height="215" srcset="https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/texture.jpg 768w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/texture-300x83.jpg 300w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/texture-614x171.jpg 614w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-414">Apple Game Center, Quantum WordPress theme from Themesorter, artist’s rendition of 1990s CD-ROM menu</p></div>
<p>The difference between this (which you may call skeuomorphism as well; I won’t stop you) and the previous example is that the metaphor is implicit, if present at all. Ideally, there is some implied metaphor: Apple’s Game Center may not actually play backgammon, but its material references to a vintage board game case can put the user’s mind in a conceptual space for gaming. Often, this tool is simply used for decoration, but tasteful decoration can still aid user experience.</p>
<h4>Depth cues</h4>
<div id="attachment_415"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-415" loading="lazy" alt="depth" src="http://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/depth.jpg" width="768" height="215" srcset="https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/depth.jpg 768w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/depth-300x83.jpg 300w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/depth-614x171.jpg 614w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-415">Apple Notification Center settings, Apple Maps, GitHub for Mac</p></div>
<p>Whereas the previous two tools always use concrete references, depth cues may or may not have such a clear analog. Their primary purpose is to imply what can be done if the user interacts with the controls they adorn, not referencing real objects themselves, but rather mechanical aspects of them.</p>
<h4>Shape / color cues</h4>
<div id="attachment_428"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-428" loading="lazy" alt="Calvetica settings, Android lock screen, Solve for iOS" src="http://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/color-shape1.jpg" width="768" height="215" srcset="https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/color-shape1.jpg 768w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/color-shape1-300x83.jpg 300w, https://interuserface.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/color-shape1-614x171.jpg 614w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-428">Calvetica settings, Android lock screen, Solve for iOS</p></div>
<p>Contrasts in shape and color are often used in conjunction with depth cues to further increase contrast and create visual hierarchy. The trend of “flat design” is to use them with minimal application of the other aforementioned tools, which can be successful so long as the application of shape and color contrasts are sufficient to create an affordance of user action.</p>
<h3>Addition and subtraction</h3>
<p>My current one-liner for when the subject comes up is <a href="https://twitter.com/claymill/status/328995618523578371">“‘flat design’ is approximately as useful a term for user interfaces as ‘red design’ or ’round design.'”</a> Far from being a shot at the popular aesthetic of relying heavily on it, though, it’s meant to provoke thought: Flatness and depth are tools, just like color and shape, affordances and analogs.</p>
<p>Don’t just practice flat design or skeuomorphic design. Use the tools that are right for the interface that’s right for your users.</p>

		<p>Recently I had a chat with the excellent <a href="https://timewitch.net/">Vallery Lancey</a>, about Kubernetes. Specifically, what we would do differently if we built something new, from the ground up, with no regard for compatibility with Kubernetes. I found that conversation so stimulating that I feel the need to write things down, so here we are.</p>

<p>Before we get started, I want to stress a few things.</p>

<ul>
<li>This is not a fully formed design. Some of these things may not work at all, or require significant redesign. Each section is one random piece of the entire puzzle.</li>
<li>These are not solely my ideas. Some I <em>think</em> are original, but like many things in the Kubernetes community it’s the product of collective thinking. I know at least <a href="https://timewitch.net/">Vallery</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/maisem_ali">Maisem Ali</a> have influenced my thinking at one time or another, and I’m forgetting many more. If you like an idea, it was a group effort. If you hate it, it’s entirely mine.</li>
<li>Some of these things are polarizing. I’m designing something that makes <em>me</em> happy.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="guiding-principles">Guiding principles</h2>

<p>My experience of Kubernetes comes from two very different places: authoring <a href="https://www.metallb.org/">MetalLB</a> for bare metal clusters, and operating a large fleet of clusters-as-a-service in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine">GKE SRE</a>. Both of these taught me that Kubernetes is extremely complex, and that most people who are trying to use it are not prepared for the sheer amount of work that lies between the marketing brochure and the system those brochures promise.</p>

<p>MetalLB taught me that it’s not possible to build robust software that integrates with Kubernetes. I think MetalLB makes a damn good go of it, but Kubernetes still makes it far too easy to construct broken configurations, and far too hard to debug them. GKE SRE taught me that even the foremost Kubernetes experts cannot safely operate Kubernetes at scale. (Although GKE SRE does a spectacular job with the tools they’re given.)</p>

<p>Kubernetes is the C++ of orchestration software. Immensely powerful, includes all the features, looks deceptively simple, and <em>will</em> hurt you repeatedly until you join its priesthood and devote your life to its mysteries. And even then, the matrix of possible ways to configure and deploy it is so large that you’re never on firm footing.</p>

<p>Continuing that analogy, my guide star is Go. If Kubernetes is C++, what would the Go of orchestration systems look like? Aggressively simple, opinionated, grown slowly and warily, and you can learn it in under a week and get on with what you were actually trying to accomplish.</p>

<p>With that, let’s get going. Starting with Kubernetes, and with a license to completely and utterly break compatibility, what would I do?</p>

<h2 id="mutable-pods">Mutable pods</h2>

<p>In Kubernetes, pods are mostly (but not entirely) immutable after creation. If you want to change a pod, you don’t. Make a new one and delete the old one. This is unlike most other things in Kubernetes, which are mostly mutable and gracefully reconcile towards the new spec.</p>

<p>So, I’m going to make pods be not special. Make them entirely read-write, and reconcile them like you would any other object.</p>

<p>The immediately useful thing I get from that is in-place restarts. If scheduling constraints and resource allocations haven’t changed, guess what? SIGTERM runc, restart runc with different parameters, and you’re done. Now pods look like regular old systemd services, that can move between machines <em>if necessary</em>.</p>

<p>Note that this doesn’t require doing mutability at the runtime layer. If you change a pod definition, it’s still mostly fine to terminate the container and restart it with a new configuration. The pod is still holding onto the resource reservation that got it scheduled onto this machine, so conceptually it’s equivalent to <code>systemctl restart blah.service</code>. You could try to be fancy and make some operations actually update in place at the runtime level as well, but don’t have to. The main benefit is decoupling scheduling, pod lifetime, and lifetime at the runtime layer.</p>

<h2 id="version-control-all-the-things">Version control all the things</h2>

<p>Sticking at the pod layer for a bit longer: now that they’re mutable, the next obvious thing I want is rollbacks. For that, let’s keep old versions of pod definitions around, and make it trivial to “go back to version N”.</p>

<p>Now, a pod update looks like: write an updated definition of the pod, and it updates to match. Update broken? Write back version N-1, and you’re done.</p>

<p>Bonus things you get from this: a diffable history of what happened to your cluster, without needing GitOps nonsense. By all means keep the GitOps nonsense if you want, it has benefits, but you can answer a basic “what changed?” question using only data in the cluster.</p>

<p>This needs a bit more design. In particular, I want to separate out external changes (human submits a new pod) from mechanical changes (some internals of k8s alter a pod definition). I haven’t thought through how to encode both those histories and make both accessible to operators and automation. Maybe it could also be completely generic, wherein a “changer” identifies itself when submitting a new version, and you can then query for changes by or excluding particular changers (think similar to how label queries work at the minute). Again, more design needed there, I just know that I want versioned objects with an accessible history.</p>

<p>We’ll need garbage collection eventually. That said, changes to single pods should delta-compress really well, so my default would be to just keep everything until it becomes a truly dumb amount of data, and figure something out at that point. Keeping everything also acts as a useful mild pressure to avoid “death by a thousand changes” in the rest of the system. Prefer to have fewer, more meaningful changes over a flurry of control loops each changing one field in pursuit of convergence.</p>

<p>Once we have this history, we can do some neat minor things too. For example, the node software could keep container images for the last N versions pinned to the machine, so that rollbacks are as fast as they can possibly be. With an accessible history, you can do this more precisely than “GC older than 30 days and hope”. Generalizing, all the orchestration software can use older versions as GC roots for various resources, to make rollbacks faster. Rollbacks being the primary way of ending outages, this is a very valuable thing to have.</p>

<h2 id="replace-deployment-with-pinneddeployment">Replace Deployment with PinnedDeployment</h2>

<p>This is a short section to basically say that <a href="https://timewitch.net/">Vallery</a> knocked it out of the park with her <a href="https://timewitch.net/post/2019-12-30-pinneddeployments/">PinnedDeployment</a> resource, which lets operators explicitly control a rollout by tracking 2 versions of the deployment state. It’s a deployment object designed by an SRE, with a crisp understanding of what SREs want in a deployment. I love it.</p>

<p>This combines super well with the versioned, in-place pod updates above, and I really don’t have anything to add. It’s clearly how multi-pod things should work. There’s probably some tweaking required to adapt from the Kubernetes-constrained world to this new wonderful unconstrained universe, but the general design is perfect.</p>

<h2 id="explicit-orchestration-workflows">Explicit orchestration workflows</h2>

<p>The biggest issue I have with the “API machinery” bits of Kubernetes is the idea of orchestration as a loose choreography of independent control loops. On the surface, this seems like a nice idea: you have dozens of little control loops, each focused on doing one small thing. When combined in a cluster, they indirectly cooperate with each other to push the state forward and converge on the desired end state. So, what’s the problem?</p>

<p>The problem is that it’s entirely impossible to debug when it goes wrong. A typical failure mode in Kubernetes is that you submit a change to the cluster, then repeatedly refresh waiting for stuff to converge. When it doesn’t… Well, you’re screwed. Kubernetes doesn’t know the difference between “the system has converged successfully” and “a control loop is wedged and is blocking everything else.” You can hope that the offending control loop posted some events to the object to help you, but by and large they don’t.</p>

<p>At which point your only option is to cat the logs of every control loop that might be involved, looking for the one that was wedged. You can make this a bit faster if you have intimate knowledge of all the control loops and what each one does, because that lets you infer from the object’s current state which loop might be trying to run right now.</p>

<p>The key thing to notice here is that the complexity has been shifted from the designer of the control loop to the cluster operator. It’s easy (though not trivial) to make a control loop that does a dinky little thing in isolation. But to operate a cluster with dozens of these control loops requires the operator to assimilate the behavior of all of them, their interactions with each other, and try to reason about an extremely loosely coupled system. This is a problem because you have to write and test the control loop once, but work with it and its bugs many more times. And yet, the bias is to simplify the thing you only do once.</p>

<p>To fix this, I would look to systemd. It solves for a similar lifecycle problem: given a current state and a target, how do you get from A to B? The difference is that in systemd, the steps and their dependencies are made explicit. You <em>tell</em> systemd that your unit is a required part of <code>multi-user.target</code> (aka “normally-booted happy system”), that it must run after filesystems have been mounted, but before networking it brought up, and so forth. You can also depend on other concrete parts of the system, for example to say that your thing needs to run whenever sshd is running (sounds like a sidecar, right?).</p>

<p>The net result of this is that systemd can tell you precisely what piece of the system malfunctioned, or is still working on its thing, or failed a precondition. It can also print you a graph of the system’s boot process, and analyze it for things like “what’s the long pole of bootup?”</p>

<p>I want to steal all this wholesale, and plop it into my cluster orchestration …</p></div></div></div>

<p>This book aims to explain Futures in Rust using an example driven approach,
exploring why they're designed the way they are, and how they work. We'll also
take a look at some of the alternatives we have when dealing with concurrency
in programming.</p>
<p>Going into the level of detail I do in this book is not needed to use futures
or async/await in Rust. It's for the curious out there that want to know <em>how</em>
it all works.</p>
<h2><a href="#what-this-book-covers" id="what-this-book-covers">What this book covers</a></h2>
<p>This book will try to explain everything you might wonder about up until the
topic of different types of executors and runtimes. We'll just implement a very
simple runtime in this book introducing some concepts but it's enough to get
started.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/stjepang">Stjepan Glavina</a> has made an excellent series of
articles about async runtimes and executors, and if the rumors are right there
is more to come from him in the near future.</p>
<p>The way you should go about it is to read this book first, then continue
reading the <a href="https://stjepang.github.io/">articles from stejpang</a> to learn more
about runtimes and how they work, especially:</p>

<li><a href="https://stjepang.github.io/2020/01/31/build-your-own-executor.html">Build your own executor</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I've limited myself to a 200 line main example (hence the title) to limit the
scope and introduce an example that can easily be explored further.</p>
<p>However, there is a lot to digest and it's not what I would call easy, but we'll
take everything step by step so get a cup of tea and relax.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the ride.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Static quantization quantizes the weights and activations of the model. It allows the user to fuse activations into preceding layers where possible. Unlike <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/PyTorch-Dynamic-Quantization/">dynamic quantization</a>, where the scales and zero points were collected during inference, the scales and zero points for static quantization were determined prior to inference using a representative dataset. Therefore, static quantization is theoretically faster than dynamic quantization while the model size and memory bandwidth consumptions remain to be the same. Therefore, statically quantized models are more favorable for inference than dynamic quantization models.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to show how to use PyTorch to do static quantizations. More details about the mathematical foundations of quantization for neural networks could be found in my article <a href="https://leimao.github.io/article/Neural-Networks-Quantization/">“Quantization for Neural Networks”</a>.</p>

<h3 id="pytorch-static-quantization">PyTorch Static Quantization</h3>

<p>Unlike TensorFlow 2.3.0 which supports integer quantization using arbitrary bitwidth from 2 to 16, PyTorch 1.7.0 only supports 8-bit integer quantization. The workflow could be as easy as loading a pre-trained floating point model and apply a static quantization wrapper. However, without doing layer fusion, sometimes such kind of easy manipulation would not result in good model performances.</p>



<p>In this case, I would like to use the ResNet18 from <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html">TorchVision models</a> as an example. I will do post-training quantization with and without layer fusion and compare their performances. The source code could also be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/leimao/PyTorch-Static-Quantization">GitHub</a>.</p>



<p>Because ResNet has skip connections addition and this addition in the TorchVision implementation uses <code>+</code>. We would have to replace this <code>+</code> (<code>torch.add</code> equivalence) with <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/1.7.0/torch.nn.quantized.html?highlight=floatfunctional#torch.nn.quantized.FloatFunctional"><code>FloatFunctional.add</code></a> (<code>torch.add</code> + <code>torch.nn.Identity</code> equivalence) in the model definition. This is because <code>torch.nn.Identity</code> serves as a flag for activation quantization. Without it, there will be no activation quantization for skip connection additions, resulting in erroneous quantization calibration.</p>



<p>In addition, we would like to test layer fusions, such as fusing <code>Conv2D</code>, <code>BatchNorm</code>, and <code>ReLU</code>. To do layer fusion, the <code>torch.nn.Module</code> name could not overlap. Otherwise it will cause erroneous quantization calibration. For example, in ordinary FP32 model, we could define one parameter-free <code>relu = torch.nn.ReLU()</code> and reuse this <code>relu</code> module everywhere. However, if we want to fuse some specific <code>ReLU</code>s, the <code>ReLU</code> modules have to be explicitly separated. So in this case, we will have to define <code>relu1 = torch.nn.ReLU()</code>, <code>relu2 = torch.nn.ReLU()</code>, etc. Sometimes, layer fusion is compulsory, since there are no quantized layer implementations corresponding to some floating point layers, such as <code>BatchNorm</code>.</p>



<p>Taken together, the modified ResNet module definition <code>resnet.py</code> is as follows.</p>

        <section>
            <p>It’s been a while since we shared the story of an incident with you, and that’s probably a good thing –
most operational incidents we had in the past year were “boring” enough in nature to fix them easily.
This time, we’ve got a story of a data loss, caused by pure and simple human error – and the story of
how we recovered the data.</p>

<p>Even though it is quite embarrassing how the data loss happened, we think it’s worth sharing the story
of its recovery, as it might allow you to learn a few useful things in case you ever end up in a
similar situation.</p>

<p>As you might have seen, over the last 7 months we’ve extended our offerings beyond ticketing to allow
our customers to transform their events into the digital space as long as the global pandemic makes
traditional event formats impossible. The result of our effort is a joint venture called 
<a href="https://venueless.org/">Venueless</a> that you should absolutely check out if you haven’t yet.</p>

<p>One component of the virtual events we run on venueless is <strong>live video streaming</strong>. In this process,
our customers use a tool like <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> or <a href="https://streamyard.com/">StreamYard</a>
to create a live video stream. The stream is then sent to an <strong>encoding server</strong> of ours via RTMP.
On the encoding server, we re-encode the stream into different quality levels and then distribute
it to our very own tiny streaming CDN.</p>

<p>Venueless currently does <strong>not yet</strong> include a video-on-demand component and usually, our customers record
their content at the source, e.g. with OBS or StreamYard, and process or publish them on their own.
However, just to be safe, we keep a recording of the incoming stream as well. This isn’t currently
part of our promoted service offering, we rather see it as a free backup service to our clients in case they
lose their recording. Given that we already consider it to just be a backup, we currently don’t make any
further backups of this data.</p>

<h4 id="data-loss">Data loss</h4>

<p>Usually, we delete these recordings after a while, but in some cases, our customers ask us to get them, e.g.
because their own recording failed, or because StreamYard only records the first 8 hours of every
stream. Since this doesn’t happen a lot, it’s not yet an automated process in our system. Whenever a customer
requests a recording we SSH into the respective encoding server and move the recording file to a
directory that’s accessible through HTTP, like this:</p>

<pre><code>/var/recordings $ mv recording-12345.flv public/
</code></pre>

<p>That’s it, we share the link with the customer, and the process is done. One of the simplest steps possible
in all this. Yesterday, a customer asked us for the recordings of the two last streams of their event. Just
before finishing up for the week, I wanted to supply them with the required file, SSH’d into the server,
looked for the correct files and typed…</p>

<pre><code>/var/recordings $ mv recording-16678.flv recording-16679.flv
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Oops.</strong> I hit return before typing out <code>public/</code>, and therefore replaced the last stream with the
second-last, losing one of the videos.</p>

<h4 id="damage-control">Damage control</h4>

<p>Having a very naive understanding of how file systems work, I knew that the <code>mv</code> command has only
changed the directory listing of the file system, but hasn’t actually wiped the file from the disk,
so I knew there is likely still a chance to recover the file, if it’s not overwritten by something
else in the meantime.</p>

<p>Since I didn’t manage to re-mount the root partition as read-only to avoid further damage softly,
I used the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/sysrq.html">big hammer</a> to remount
everything read-only immediately:</p>

<pre><code># echo u &gt; /proc/sysrq-trigger
</code></pre>

<p>Uhm, okay, this worked, but how do I install any data recovery tools now? After some experiments,
I decided it would be easiest to reboot into the recovery system provided by our server provider
<a href="https://www.hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a>. So I configured the boot loader to boot their recovery system
from the network and forcefully rebooted the server.</p>

<p>To be able to perform disk dumps and have some operational flexibility without downloading a 2 TB
disk image to my local machine (which would take rougly a week), I also quickly purchased
a <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-box">Hetzner Storage Box</a> with 5 TB space.</p>

<h4 id="failed-attempts">Failed attempts</h4>

<p>Just before I executed my fatal <code>mv</code> command, I executed <code>ls -lisah</code> to get a directory listing
of the files:</p>

<pre><code>3146449 1.1G -rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 1.1G Nov XX XX:XX recording-16678.flv
3146113 1.6G -rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 1.6G Nov XX XX:XX recording-16679.flv
</code></pre>

<p>This meant I <strong>knew</strong> the inode number of the deleted file! As I mentioned before, my understanding
of file systems was (and is) rather naive, and I was pretty optimistic to be able to recover the
file using that information. Isn’t that sort of what a journaling file system is for?</p>

<p>Recovering the file this way hover appeared to be impossible. <a href="http://ext4magic.sourceforge.net/howto_en.html">ext4magic</a>
and <a href="http://extundelete.sourceforge.net/">extundelete</a> are powerful tools that did find some 
deleted files on my disk – but not the one I was looking for, even after trying different options
for over two hours.</p>

<p>I did not spend the time to really understand how ext4 works, but from what I gathered from various
blogs, I was pretty much out of luck since the inode did no longer contain the relevant information
and ext4magic also wasn’t able to <a href="http://ext4magic.sourceforge.net/howto_en.html#Recovery_process_5">recover the neccessary information from the journal</a>
either.</p>

<p>However, if you’re in a similar situation – the ext4magic how-tos are really helpful and worth a try.</p>

<h4 id="successful-recovery">Successful recovery</h4>

<p>There is this one other approach to file recovery that is often recommended on the internet, usually
for “small text files”: Just <code>grep</code> your whole disk for known parts of its contents! So why wouldn’t
this work on larger non-text files as well?</p>

<p>The first problem is obviously what to grep for. The only thing I know about the missing file, apart
from its rough size, is that it’s a FLV video file. Luckily, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Video#Flash_Video_Structure">all FLV files</a>
that contain video start with the byte sequence <code>FLV\x01\x05</code>. So let’s search our 2 TB disk for
that byte sequence and print out the byte offset of all occurences!</p>

<pre><code>cat /dev/md2 \
	| pv -s 1888127576000 \
	| grep -P --byte-offset --text 'FLV\x01\x05' \
	| tee -a /mnt/storagebox/grep-log.txt
</code></pre>

<p>This took roughly 7 hours. The <code>pv</code> command with the (rough) total size of the disk is optional, but gives you
a nice progress bar. Overall, this took a little over 6 hours on our server.</p>

<p><code>grep</code> works line-based, which in a binary file menas “any byte sequence between two ASCII line breaks”. The
log file therefore contained lots of lines like this:</p>

<pre><code>184473878409:&lt;some binary data&gt;FLV&lt;some binary data&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In total, the search found 126 FLV file headers on our disk. This was pretty reassuring, since we had 122 FLV files
still known to the file system – so there are at least four FLV byte sequences without a filename!</p>

<pre><code># find /mnt/disk/var/recordings/ -name '*.flv' -not -empty -ls | wc -l
122
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I needed to find out which of the 126 byte sequences did not have a filename. Since I really didn’t want
to spend all weekend with a deep-dive into the ext4 disk layout, I went for an easier solution: For every file
still known in the file system, I computed a hash of the first 500 kilobytes of the file:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>#!/usr/bin/python3

<p>Interestingly, two files from the completely different customers shared the same hash of the first 500 kilobytes.
I haven’t tested it yet, but my theory is that those were streams that just did not contain any audio or video
in their first minutes, but only empty frames. However, since I knew this isn’t the case for my missing file,
I felt confident in proceeding with this approach.</p>

<p>Next, I computed the same hash for every byte offest found by grep and compared it to the hashes found in the
previous step:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>grep_log</span> <span>=</span> <span>'/mnt/storagebox/grep-log.txt'</span>

<p><a href="https://github.com/colour-science/colour/releases/tag/v0.3.16">Colour 0.3.16</a>
has finally been released!</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->
<p>This release integrates all the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">GSoC</a>
work from Pawel (<a href="https://github.com/enneract">@enneract</a>), most of the code
from Nishant (<a href="https://github.com/njwardhan">@njwardhan</a>) and, the
optimizations from Omar (<a href="https://github.com/OmarWagih1">@OmarWagih1</a>).
We would like to thank them again for their great contributions!</p>
<p><img alt="/images/Blog_Colour_Rendition_Report.png" src="https://www.colour-science.org/images/Blog_Colour_Rendition_Report.png"></p><p>With this release, we stop testing for
<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-350/">Python 3.5</a> and,
<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/release.1.1.0.html">Scipy&gt;=1.1.0</a>
becomes the minimum version. This is also the <strong>last feature release to
support</strong> <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-270/">Python 2.7</a>.
We will also trim the deprecation code in the next version thus, please make
sure to update your code accordingly.</p>
<p>Besides the various minor changes and fixes, the highlights of this release are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Support for <em>Jakob and Hanika (2019)</em>, <em>Mallett and Yuksel (2019)</em> and,
<em>Otsu, Yamamoto and Hachisuka (2018)</em> spectral upsampling methods thanks to
Pawel's contributions as part of GSoC 2020.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for the computation of the <em>CIE 2017 Colour Fidelity Index</em> and
<em>ANSI/IES TM-30-18 Colour Fidelity Index</em> colour quality metrics thanks to
Pawel's contributions as part of GSoC 2020.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for generation of the <em>ANSI/IES TM-30-18 Colour Rendition Report</em>
thanks to Pawel's contributions as part of GSoC 2020.</p></li>
<li><p>Improvements of the LUT IO support thanks to Nishant's contributions as
part of GSoC 2020.</p></li>
<li><p>Performance improvements thanks to Omar's contributions as part of GSoC
2020.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for <em>ACES Input Device Transform (IDT)</em> generation: The
implementation follows to some extent
<a href="https://github.com/ampas/rawtoaces">RAW to ACES v1</a> and
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ouwnid1aevqti5d/P-2013-001.pdf?dl=0">P-2013-001</a>
procedure.</p></li>
<li>
<p>New <em>ISO</em> spectral datasets:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ISO 6728 Standard Lens</p></li>
<li><p>ISO 7589 Diffuser</p></li>
<li><p>ISO 7589 Photographic Daylight</p></li>
<li><p>ISO 7589 Sensitometric Daylight</p></li>
<li><p>ISO 7589 Studio Tungsten</p></li>
<li><p>ISO 7589 Sensitometric Studio Tungsten</p></li>
<li><p>ISO 7589 Photoflood</p></li>
<li><p>ISO 7589 Sensitometric Photoflood</p></li>
<li><p>ISO 7589 Sensitometric Printer</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Support for IGPGTG colourspace by <em>Hellwig and Fairchild (2020)</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <cite>colour.SpectralDistribution.interpolate</cite> and
<cite>colour.MultiSpectralDistributions.interpolate</cite> methods now honour class
instantiation time interpolation parameters instead of blindly applying
<em>CIE 167:2005</em> recommendation, this introduces minor numerical changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Many definitions, methods and module attributes have been renamed to
improve consistency and we are reaching a satisfactory point in that
regard, hopefully, the names will be much more stable from now on.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please visit the <a href="https://github.com/colour-science/colour/releases/tag/v0.3.16">releases page</a>
for complete details.</p>
<p>Our other dependent Python packages have also been updated accordingly:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/colour-science/colour-demosaicing/releases/tag/v0.1.6">Colour - Demosaicing - 0.1.6</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/colour-science/colour-hdri/releases/tag/v0.1.8">Colour - HDRI - 0.1.8</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/colour-science/colour-checker-detection/releases/tag/v0.1.2">Colour - Checker Detection - 0.1.2</a></p></li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/colour-science/colour-datasets/releases/tag/v0.1.1">Colour - Datasets - 0.1.1</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The following new datasets have been added:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>4050598 : Spectral Upsampling Coefficient Tables - Jakob and
Hanika (2019)</p></li>
<li><p>4051012 : Measured Commercial LED Spectra - Brendel (2020)</p></li>
