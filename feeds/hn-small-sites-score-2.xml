    <p>Press Release<br>July 30, 2020</p>

<h3><strong>Google removes all Danish music from YouTube </strong></h3>
<h5>While the negotiations on a new joint Nordic agreement are in full swing, Google have chosen to leverage their total dominance in the market in the strongest way possible. On the evening of Thursday 30 July, Google announced that they will soon remove all Danish music content on YouTube.</h5>

<p>Under the auspices of the Nordic alliance of collecting societies, Polaris, negotiations on a joint Nordic agreement on the use of music on YouTube are currently in full swing. The agreement will replace the local agreements of the Norwegian, Finnish and Danish composers and songwriters’ societies, combining them in a single, joint agreement with Google. In the case of Koda, the national agreement for Denmark expired in April, after which it was temporarily extended – as is standard practice in the industry while negotiating a new agreement.</p>
<p>Now, however, Google have issued a new demand: if the agreement is to be temporarily extended, Koda must agree to reduce the payment provided to composers and songwriters for YouTube’s use of music by almost 70% – despite the fact that YouTube’s use of music has increased significantly since Koda entered into its last agreement with Google.</p>
<p>Of course, Koda cannot accept these terms, and Google have now unilaterally decided that Koda’s members cannot have their content shown on YouTube and that their fans and users on YouTube will be unable to listen to Koda members’ music until a new agreement is in place.</p>
<p>Although the parties involved in the negotiations on the new joint agreement are by no means in concord yet, progress has been made in recent weeks, and Koda is puzzled by the extremely aggressive approach taken by Google in the negotiations this time.</p>
<h5><strong>Koda’s media director, Kaare Struve, says:</strong></h5>
<p>‘Google have always taken an “our way or the highway” approach, but even for Google, this is a low point. Of course, Google know that they can create enormous frustration among our members by denying them access to YouTube – and among the many Danes who use YouTube every day. We can only suppose that by doing so, YouTube hope to be able to push through an agreement, one where they alone dictate all terms’.</p>
<p>Ever since the first agreement was signed in 2013, the level of payments received from YouTube has been significantly lower than the level of payment agreed to by subscription-based services.</p>
<h5><strong>Koda’s CEO, Gorm Arildsen, says:</strong></h5>
<p>‘It is no secret that our members have been very dissatisfied with the level of payment received for the use of their music on YouTube for many years now. And it’s no secret that we at Koda have actively advocated putting an end to the tech giants’ free-ride approach and underpayment for artistic content in connection with the EU’s new Copyright Directive. The fact that Google now demands that the payments due from them should be reduced by almost 70% in connection with a temporary contract extension seems quite bizarre’.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span><span>H</span>ow to differ a bad contractor from a good partner?</span> There can be many advantages of working by the outsourced model, but also a lot of risks. Finding a good partner is difficult, but it is an ambitious and necessary task. We wrote this article to <span>differ</span> it from a bad and irresponsible contractor. What kind of mistakes do contractors make, so it`s not worth working with them?</p>
<h3><b>SIGN #1 WORK OF THE TEAM IS NOT VISIBLE</b></h3>
<p><span>The manager assured that the team was working and would show the result “in the nearest future”, and after weeks of work, it wasn`t clear what the result of the project is and whether work is underway.</span></p>
<p><span>How it is needed:</span></p>
<p><span>Use the Scrum project management methodology:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Carry out daily calls where show the status of the tasks</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Make the result demonstration each sprint (2 weeks)</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Analyze the results of each sprint</span></p>
<p><span>What is the benefit for you:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You see not only the final result but also understand the progress along with the sprint</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You see delays and problems on time and keep your finger on the pulse</span></p>
<h3><b>SIGN </b><b>#2 DOUBTFUL CODE QUALITY</b></h3>
<p><span>In a rush, programmers write low-quality code that cannot be supported. Because of this, in the future, it will be necessary to rewrite the system from scratch or it will not perform the necessary tasks and functions at all. </span><span>The system may run slowly due to poor-quality and unstructured code, so it will be extremely difficult and expensive to finalize a new module.</span></p>
<p><span>How it is needed:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Make and show a code quality assessment using special programs – professional tools for analysis</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Work on git-flow, where some programmers check others to avoid mistakes</span></p>
<p><span>What is the benefit for you:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You don’t need to overpay for alterations</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You get a working system that is easy to refine and scale</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Other programmers and teams can easily work with the code</span></p>
<h3><img src="https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2.png" alt="Подрядчик в IT" width="800" height="552" srcset="https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2.png 800w, https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-300x207.png 300w, https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-768x530.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></h3>
<h3><b>SING #3 NO DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROJECT</b></h3>
<p><span>The contractor simply performs the task pool, not wanting to delve into the subtleties of the project and study it. </span><span>Developers just write the code the way they understand the task.</span></p>
<p><span>How it is needed:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Make a competitor analysis and study successful counterparts in the market to understand trends and delve deeply into the project</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Fix errors and improve the system along the way, playing the role of business analysts</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Developers write code, taking into account business requirements, think about creating a product that will be interesting and convenient for the user</span></p>
<p><span>What is the benefit for you:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ The contractor isn’t just “hands” that build, but also a “head” that will find and come up with the best solution</span></p>
<h3><b>SING #4 JUST THE VISIBILITY OF WORK, MANY EXTRA MOVEMENTS</b></h3>
<p><span>The team creates the appearance of work – constantly there are new documents with a description, new work files. </span><span>The code is simply written just for fact and over time it turns out that the functions aren’t logical, inconvenient, or impossible to use. </span><span>Business doesn’t get results – a system that can be used.</span></p>
<p><span>How it is needed:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Iteratively create a finished product that can be used after the first sprints</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Instead of 20 sheets of documentation, make one prototype and clearly show how the new module will work</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Don’t just write code but offer a solution for business – work functions that are needed</span></p>
<p><span>What is the benefit for you:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You get the result – a system that you can use&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Save time and money</span></p>
<h3><b>SING</b><b> #5 DON`T CARE ABOUT DESIGN</b></h3>
<p><span>Bad contractors focus only on functionality and don’t consider design as an important stage in product development and as a tool to achieve project goals. </span><span>Don’t reuse logic/components from already developed system modules. </span><span>Don’t use a design system – a unified style and approach to project design.</span></p>
<p><span>How it is needed:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Follow the best solutions of modern UI/UX design with care for the user</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Don’t just develop functionality to the level of “everything works fine”, but make a big emphasis on the visual part to the level of “comfortable and beautiful”</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Use ready-made solutions and components from already completed system modules</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Use the design system and templates in the design to speed up the work and improve its quality</span></p>
<p><span>What is the benefit for you:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Time for design and engineering is allocated as efficiently as possible</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Users get a product that looks like they want to use it all the time – all because it has a responsive, understandable, convenient, inspirational design!</span></p>

<h3><b>SING</b><b> #6 GO TO NEW FUNCTIONS WITHOUT COMPLETING PREVIOUS</b></h3>
<p><span>For your product, you have conceived many functions that are described in the specifications for the contractor. He began developing all the functions at once but didn’t complete any of them properly. Six months later, all the modules are “almost ready” but none can be used.</span></p>
<p><span>How it is needed:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Give the revised functions – correctly working modules that take into account all the scenarios. Screens are correctly displayed on all devices and all operating systems. Pages correctly show information, even if there is no data, there is no Internet or the user entered an incorrect value</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Develop all functions in stages, bringing them to the desired result – a modified functional that you can use</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Pass to the new task only after the previous one is fully completed</span></p>
<p><span>What is the benefit for you:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You see how your product is formed – gradually, but with visible results</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You get working functions after the end of the current sprints, and not at the very end of the project when it turns out that something remains unfinished</span></p>
<p>We think you have found at least a couple of matches with the work of your current or ex contractor. Their mistakes and lack of professionalism can cost you the success of the entire project, so we advise you to carefully choose the company to which you are ready to entrust your business. We try to follow the principles described in the paragraphs “how it is needed”, taking care of you and the end-users of your product. Speaking of the importance of outsourcing, <span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2020/07/08/why-its-important-to-outsource-right-now/#a0dbea670e9a">Forbes wrote an excellent article</a>.</span></p>
<p>The next step after choosing a contractor will be writing a statement of work (SOW or specifications). In our article <span><a href="https://proarea.co/blog/how-to-make-correct-requirement-specifications/">“How to make correct requirement specifications”</a></span>, we have written everything you need to consider. Good luck with implementing your ambitious ideas!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span><span>R</span>equirement specifications are the main project document, describing all its technical and non-technical issues. Any of your ideas are just ideas until specifications developed. In this article, we will explain why this document is so important, when it`s correct to begin development and what exactly it should contain.</span></p>
<h3><b>WHY YOU NEED REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATIONS</b></h3>
<p><span>If you don’t describe the expected result, don`t formulate a clear task and project requirements, you will:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>overpay for work and edits;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>waste time;</span></li>
<li><span>get not at all what you want and again overpay for edits;</span></li>
<li><span>close the project due to the fact that there are no more resources for corrections.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>And in order to prevent this, it is important to write requirement specifications. In order for the team to understand specific tasks and be able to implement them so that the expectation and the final product result coincide.</span></p>
<h3><strong>THE SPECIFICATIONS` ROLE IN DIFFERENT PROJECT STAGES</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><span><b> Formation of business requirements</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>This is the foundation for project implementation. At this stage goals and budgets are set. Here the requirement development begins because it determines the future product success. All further work on specifications should be based on business requirements.</span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><span><b> MVP development</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>It’s almost impossible to build the perfect product on the first try. In any case, it will change based on the feedback of the market and users. Therefore, it is logical to start with MVP – the minimum viable product. For the development of MVP, </span><span>specifications</span><span> are as important as for the development of the main product. At this stage, the </span><span>specifications</span><span> task defines:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>basic functions and user interface needed to test a hypothesis;</span></li>
<li><span>criteria necessary for understanding the success of the implementation and launch of the first product version on the market.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>So, </span><span>specifications</span><span> at the MVP development stage describe which functions are needed and how it is necessary (minimal and sufficient) to implement in order to test the hypothesis.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rlprkv.png" alt="requirement specifications" width="800" height="552" srcset="https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rlprkv.png 800w, https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rlprkv-300x207.png 300w, https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rlprkv-768x530.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><span><b> Main product development</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>After the successful launch of MVP, </span><span>requirements</span><span> for the main product are finalized based on the results: a positive market reaction, as confirmation that the business model is working. That is necessary to take into account and describe in </span><span>specifications</span><span>, we wrote in detail in the 3rd section of this document. At this stage, </span><span>requirements </span><span>play a crucial role:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>take into account market features (business opportunities, necessary budgets, target audience);</span></li>
<li><span>define the project objectives;</span></li>
<li><span>demonstrate use cases;</span></li>
<li><span>captures functional, non-functional, and technical requirements so that the product is properly designed.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>At this stage, </span><span>specifications</span><span> are a complete guide to action, completely describing all important points, starting from a business analysis of the market and target audience, ending with colors, fonts, and other details.</span></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><span><b> Marketing promotion</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>In good </span><span>specifications,</span><span> there is a place for market research, competitors, communication channels with potential users, and resources for promotion. Marketing promotion is the logical and necessary project support at the start and after it. If you don’t initially plan marketing activity, you probably won’t take into account the resources (in particular, the money) needed for a confident release. You run the risk of being left completely without promotion since the main resources will go to development. So, without the described marketing, you can confront a lot of problems:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>lack of promotion resources;</span></li>
<li><span>lack of understanding of the market and its users;</span></li>
<li><span>failure to provide your product benefits to the audience;</span></li>
<li><span>and as a result – market failure.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>At this stage, </span><span>specifications</span><span> are the answer to the question “what to do after the release?”</span></p>
<p><img src="https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/fke2.png" alt="requirement specifications" width="800" height="552" srcset="https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/fke2.png 800w, https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/fke2-300x207.png 300w, https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/fke2-768x530.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>

<p>This article documents the thought process and steps involved in refactoring a distributed monolith to microservices. We are going to remove API GW, use Amazon Event Bridge and implement BASE consistency in the system to truly decouple our microservices.</p>



<p><em>This blog is also available as a presentation. Reach out
if you would like me to present it at an event. </em></p>



<p>I will use the codebase from the previous installment to the series that can be found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/general/aws-serverless-you-might-not-need-third-party-monitoring/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. The first part focuses on creating the codebase and implementing AWS native observability, monitoring and alerting services. As always you can find the code that we used in the respective GitHub repositories over here: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/rehanvdm/MicroService" target="_blank">https://github.com/rehanvdm/MicroService</a>.</p>



<h2>Original System</h2>



<p>The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="original system (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/general/aws-serverless-you-might-not-need-third-party-monitoring/index.html" target="_blank">original system</a> is a distributed monolith that consists of three microservices. </p>



<figure><a href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_01_SystemArchitecture.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_01_SystemArchitecture-1024x715.png" alt="" width="1024" height="715" srcset="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_01_SystemArchitecture-1024x715.png 1024w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_01_SystemArchitecture-300x210.png 300w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_01_SystemArchitecture-768x536.png 768w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_01_SystemArchitecture.png 1111w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Original system (Click to enlarge)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Within each project you can find an <strong>OpenAPI </strong>(<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/rehanvdm/MicroServicePerson/blob/master/part1/src/lambda/api/api-definition.yaml" target="_blank">part2/src/lambda/api/api-definition.yaml</a>) file that defines the API definition for each service.<strong> AWS CDK</strong> is used and they all follow the similar stock standard CDK project layout: Typescript for the CDK and <strong>ES6 JS</strong> for the application code. NPM commands have been written to do deployments and it also contains<strong> end-to-end tests </strong>using Mocha and Chai. In addition, each service contains a detailed README inside the /part2 path. Note that I only have a single Lambda for the API endpoint and do internal routing. Yes, I believe in a <strong>Lambalith for the API</strong> 😊 and also prefer JSON POST over REST (more about this later). </p>



<p>A <strong>problem </strong>arises as soon as these microservices start to call one another. We will focus on the creation of a new person to demonstrate how this <strong>tight coupling</strong> is working. </p>



<p>The client service stores clients and has basic <em>create-client</em> and <em>find-client</em> functionalities as well as an endpoint to increment the person count for a specific client. The person service also has basic <em>create-person</em> and <em>find-person</em> endpoints. When a person is created, it calls the common service which notifies me by email about the new person that was added using an SNS subscription. The common service first needs to do a lookup on the client service so that it can enrich the email. It also increments the counter on the client. Click on the image below to see the step-by-step path for creating a person:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_02_SystemArchitecturePathFocus.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_02_SystemArchitecturePathFocus-1024x553.png" alt="" width="1024" height="553" srcset="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_02_SystemArchitecturePathFocus-1024x553.png 1024w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_02_SystemArchitecturePathFocus-300x162.png 300w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_02_SystemArchitecturePathFocus-768x415.png 768w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_02_SystemArchitecturePathFocus.png 1442w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption> <br>Original system – full create person flow (Click to enlarge) </figcaption></figure>



<p>The <em>create-person</em> call is highly dependent on the common service and does not even know that the common service is dependent on the client service. As a result, the person service is also dragged down if either the common or the client service is down. Not to mention that it now has to wait for the completion of every step in the synchronous chain. This wastes money and increases the probability of hitting the API Gateway timeout of 29 seconds.</p>



<h2>Decoupling with Amazon Event Bridge</h2>



<p>Amazon Event Bridge is a serverless event bus that makes it easy to work with <strong>event-driven architectures</strong>. It works on a basic <strong>publish and subscribe</strong> model. We use it to emit certain events like: <em>person-created </em>and <em>client-created.</em> Other services can then listen to only the events that they want and act on it. The new system is refactored to incorporate this and remove the direct HTTP API calls between services. </p>



<figure><a href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_03_EVentBridge.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_03_EVentBridge-1024x522.png" alt="" width="1024" height="522" srcset="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_03_EVentBridge-1024x522.png 1024w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_03_EVentBridge-300x153.png 300w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_03_EVentBridge-768x391.png 768w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_03_EVentBridge.png 1531w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption> <br>New system (Click to enlarge)  </figcaption></figure>



<p>The <strong>client service</strong> has not changed much. It is still
fronted with API Gateway (GW). It now emits an event onto the bus whenever a
client is created. A new Lambda function is added that listens to the <em>create-person</em> events. This increments the person counter for that specific client.
This feature was previously on the common service but has now moved to the
client service.</p>



<p>The <strong>person service</strong> is working exactly as before. Just
like the client service, it also emits an event onto the event bus,
specifically the <em>create-person</em> event.</p>



<p>The <strong>common service</strong> no longer needs to be fronted by
API GW. Instead it listens to both the <em>create-client</em> and <em>create-person</em>
events. The common service stores the client data in its own DynamoDB table. It
uses this to look the client up within itself (locally), rather than calling an
HTTP API to get the data for a specific client. The common service still sends
an email when a new person is added. </p>



<p>From an <strong>external integration point of view</strong>, all API endpoints stayed exactly the same. The diagrams below clearly illustrate that each service is only concerned with its own data and responsibilities. The event that is emitted onto the bus is also added for convenience.</p>

<p><strong>Internally</strong> the common service has an Event Bridge Rule with the Lambda function as target. It listens to the <em>create-client</em> events and then stores only the client-id and client name fields within its own DynamoDB table. This <strong>removes the need for it to do an HTTP API call</strong> to the client service as it can now just do the lookup locally against its own data store.</p>

<p>The common service also listens to the <em>create-person</em> event. It <strong>looks up the client information in its own DynamoDB table</strong> and then sends the SNS message. <strong>At the same time</strong>, the client service also listens to the <em>create-person</em> events. It uses the client-id that comes with the event to increment the person counter for that specific client in the client service DynamoDB table. </p>

<h2>What has changed?</h2>



<p>We used Event Bridge to<strong> remove direct HTTP API calls</strong> between microservices. It also allowed us to <strong>move some logic</strong> to where it belongs. The common service should not be responsible to increment the specific client’s person counter in the first place. That functionality is now contained within the client service, where it belongs. </p>



<p>We basically borrowed two principles from the <strong>SOLID OOP principles</strong>: </p>



<ul><li>Single Responsibility – Each service is only concerned with its own core functionality.</li><li>Open Closed – Each service is now open for extension, but the core functionality is closed for modification.</li></ul>







<p>Then we introduced <strong>BASE consistency</strong> into the system: </p>



<ul><li><strong>B</strong>asic <strong>A</strong>vailability – Even if the client service is down the common service can still operate as it has a copy of the data. Thus the data layer/plane is still operational.</li><li><strong>S</strong>oft State – Stores don’t have to be write-consistent or mutually consistent all the time.</li><li><strong>E</strong>ventual Consistency – The system will become consistent over time, given that the system doesn’t receive input during that time.</li></ul>







<p>A BASE system is almost always going to be an <strong>AP system</strong> if you look at the CAP theorem. Meaning it favors <strong>A</strong>vailability and <strong>P</strong>artitioning over <strong>C</strong>onsistency. </p>



<figure><a href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_08_CAP.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_08_CAP.png" alt="" width="966" height="683" srcset="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_08_CAP.png 966w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_08_CAP-300x212.png 300w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_08_CAP-768x543.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 966px) 100vw, 966px"></a><figcaption>CAP theorem applied to Databases (Click to enlarge)</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>DynamoDB </strong>is an example of an <strong>AP system</strong> as well. Your data is stored on multiple 10GB partition drives spread over multiple Availability Zones. That replication takes a few milliseconds, up to a second or two. Obviously, there are cases where you need to read the data back directly after writing. That is why you can specify a Strongly Consistent read, which just goes back to the writer node and queries the data there instead of waiting for the data to have propagated to all nodes. </p>



<p><strong>S3 </strong>has <strong>read-after-write consistency for the PUT item</strong> command but all <strong>other commands are subject to eventual consistency.</strong> This means that after updating an item, the old content may still be returned for a short amount of time until the content of that file has propagated to all the storage nodes. There are more examples such as these all over the AWS ecosystem.</p>



<p>Event-driven architectures come with their own <strong>pros and cons</strong>. Firstly, you need to <strong>approach the problem with a different distributed mindset</strong> that needs to be present within the company/team as well. Event <strong>versioning and communication</strong> between teams that own microservices are also crucial. It is a good idea to have a service that keeps a <strong>ledger of all events that happen</strong> in the system. Worst case, this history of events can be replayed to fix any processing errors in the downstream processing. </p>



<p>Event bridge, like SNS and SQS, guarantees delivery of a message at least once. This means your <strong>system needs to be idempotent</strong>. An example of an idempotent flow is when the client is created and the common service does a PUT command into the DynamoDB table. If that event gets delivered more than once, it just overwrites the current client with the exact same data.</p>



<p>An example of a non-idempotent flow is when the person is
created. If the client service gets more than one message, it increments the
client-person counter more than once. There are ways to make this call
idempotent, but we’ll leave that for a different blog. </p>



<p>Another thing to consider is that not all systems can accept the delay that eventual consistency introduces into a system. It is perfectly acceptable in our system as a person will probably not be created immediately within one second after a client has been created. Thus, whenever the common service does the client lookup locally, it can be assured that the client data is always populated. </p>



<h2>Resilience to Failure</h2>



<p>One of the benefits that we have achieved by refactoring to a microservice system is that we are now r<strong>esilient to complete services failure</strong>. The client service can still operate if the person and common service is down. Similarly, the person service can operate on its own and is not dependent on the other services.</p>



<p>We also <strong>removed any timeout problems that was introduced</strong> by the previous architecture that synchronously chained API calls. If an Event Bridge target service (like Lambda, in our case) is down, it will retry sending the message with exponential bakeoff for up to 24 hours. </p>



<p>All Lambda functions that process the asynchronous events from Event Bridge have <strong>Dead Letter Queues</strong> (DLQ) …</p></div></div>

  <blockquote>
<p>TL;DR - These are my notes for a potential computer hobbyist personal computer architecture. Someone called it "Minix for motherboards".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This roughly describes an architecture of off the shelf microcontroller components that can be used to create a basic standalone PC, somewhere in the neighborhood of performance of an old 286/386 DOS style PC.</p>
<p>If I build this, it will almost certainly be done in Rust. I do hope to specify the protocol/operational semantics well enough that you could create a component that was written in Micro/Circuit Python, C/C++, Ada, or maybe even as an embedded linux PC.</p>
<p>I currently am working on other projects, but I feel like this would be a fun project to stream, or maybe even write a book about learning embedded systems, or learning Rust with embedded systems?</p>
<p><strong>If you'd be interested in taking a class building/using a system like this, or would be interested in seeing this happen, <a href="mailto:james.munns@ferrous-systems.com">send me a message</a>.</strong></p>

<h2 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to design a PC-ish architecture that makes it easy for people learning embedded systems to build a single component. This includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Making the system resistant to failure of a single component</li>
<li>Use only protocols/components that can be easily purchased</li>
<li>Be adaptive to allow for variety of components used</li>
<li>Value simplicity over performance</li>
<li>Make the steps to initial success very short</li>
<li>Make this fun for me and other collaborators to work on</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="project-anti-goals">Project Anti-Goals</h2>
<ol>
<li>Designing something that is wholly useful in commercial deployments</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="interesting-ideas">Interesting Ideas</h2>
<p>These are ideas that I think will help make the project successful.</p>
<h3 id="every-component-is-a-microcontroller-any-microcontroller">Every Component is a Microcontroller - Any Microcontroller.</h3>
<p>The idea is to have every part (or <strong>Component</strong>) of the system be its own standalone microcontroller system. Honestly, this is how most computers work today anyway, but the idea is to be able to use almost any microcontroller, from 8051, to Arm Cortex-M, to RISC-V parts, for any piece of the PC. At some point, I can see people even making parts of the PC out of FPGAs as well.</p>
<p>This includes all of the following PC parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Main CPU/Processor</li>
<li>An input controller (Keyboard/Mouse/Touch)</li>
<li>A network interface (Ethernet/Wi-Fi/LPWAN)</li>
<li>A storage controller (SSD/SD/HDD/RAMFS/USB)</li>
<li>A Sound Card</li>
<li>A graphics card (framebuffer, shaders)</li>
</ul>
<p>The system should use a protocol that almost every device has support for, and is forgiving. For that reason, I plan to use SPI for system communication.</p>
<h3 id="the-bus-protocol-spi-but-weird">The Bus Protocol - SPI, but weird.</h3>
<p>So, SPI is a simple, fast, and reliable protocol, but the trick is that it is WAY easier to write a SPI Controller, rather than a SPI peripheral. Since I want things to be simplest for the people writing the Components, they should be the SPI Controllers. But this leaves us with a problem, how do we make a PC with N SPI Controllers work with a single SPI peripheral? Here is where it gets weird.</p>
<ol>
<li>Every Component is a SPI Controller, with SCK, COPI, and CIPO pins wired to a central <strong>Arbitrator</strong>.</li>
<li>Every Component also has two GPIOs:
<ul>
<li>An output that is a "Request" line. This signals to the Arbitrator that the Component would like to talk</li>
<li>An input that is a "Go-Ahead" line. This signals to the Component to begin talking to the Arbitrator</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this system, the Arbitrator will either support being a SPI Peripheral for a lot of lines, or will handle MUXing the SCK/COPI/CIPO pins as necessary.
The Arbitrator will decide which component it wants to talk to, and for how long.
When a Component pulls its Request line low, the arbitrator will eventually acknowledge this by pulling the Component's Go-Ahead line low.
The Component can begin clocking SPI data at whatever speed it feels like, up to the maximum speed supported by the Arbitrator.
When the Component is done sending/receiving data, it checks whether the Go-Ahead line is still low.
If so, then the message was "accepted" by the arbitrator.
If the Go-Ahead line is released high before the Component releases the Request line, this means that the arbitrator has "hung up" on the Component, meaning either an error or timeout has occurred.</p>
<h3 id="the-arbitrator-basically-a-northbridge-chip">The Arbitrator - Basically a Northbridge chip</h3>
<p>The Arbitrator has two primary tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Arbitrating the Bus Protocol as described above, servicing and discovering components that have been connected</li>
<li>Managing memory allocations used to communicate between devices</li>
</ol>
<p>I've already described the lowest level of the protocol above - we'll use an awkward SPI communication. However I haven't described how the higher protocol layers work.</p>
<p>All devices will communicate through a mailbox system.
The arbitrator will take data from the Components, and place them in an in-memory object store.
Each created item will be assigned a UUID, which will be returned to the Component on creation.
This UUID can then be placed in a mailbox to another component, sending access to the data to that component.
Each item is read-only.</p>
<p>Example (psuedocode):</p>
<pre><span>// A binary RPC messages are sent from Component to the Arbitrator
// The format will probably be binary, but maybe with an alternative
// command to use the following REPL format?
//
// Components are also assigned a UUID on boot. This Component has
// the own-address of 9ea8b6a7-2967-4db8-98b8-d4577548ed04.

// Data can be stored to the Arbitrator memory space. Data can then be
// referenced as inter-device storage using UUIDs as a reference. Data
// is allocated on a FIFO basis, with oldest memory items becoming
// dropped.

// The arbitrator may choose to limit the rate, maximum size or other

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Hypervisor memory introspection (HVMI) has been around for quite some time now, and there are several open-source projects utilizing virtual-machine introspection (VMI), one way or another. Generally, existing projects focus on debugging or tracing the execution of a guest VM. In this blog post, we introduce a slightly different approach to memory introspection; live protection of guest VMs. We cover the motivation behind our HVMI engine, how it was conceived, how it evolved over time, and finally, why we made it available for everyone.</p>

<p>Throughout this blog, we assume the reader has some basic knowledge about virtualization technologies (Intel VT-x specifically) and about OS internals (both Windows and Linux), although we try to cover as much ground as possible when it comes to technical details.</p>

<h2 id="what-hvmi-is">What HVMI Is</h2>

<p>Memory introspection is the technique of analyzing the contents of a guest VM from outside. The most common way to achieve this is using a hypervisor – running guest VMs are analyzed or introspected by the hypervisor. The CPU context can be viewed, the contents of the physical memory can be observed, and so on. In addition to simply analyzing the state of the VM, the introspection logic, or HVMI (how we refer to it from here on) also leverages the virtualization features provided by the CPU to provide security.</p>

<p>For example, by using the Extended Page Table (EPT) feature provided by Intel CPUs, HVMI overrides the guest OS memory protection policies. HVMI could, for example, enforce a no-execute policy for certain memory areas, and an exploit would fail even if it compromised the OS kernel. In addition to using the EPT to enforce memory access restrictions, HVMI can also use other virtualization capabilities to offer security. It can prevent modification of certain critical resources, such as control registers or model specific registers. Rootkits or exploits that rely on modifying these will fail because HVMI blocks the modifications.</p>

<p>HVMI is not about just advantages; it does have some drawbacks. One of the most important disadvantages of HVMI is the semantic gap – from outside the VM, we see only raw physical memory, with no apparent meaning. To do something useful, we must infer what those memory pages contain. Is it a process structure, is it a stack page, etc. In addition to the semantic gap, providing protection for certain system resources may prove challenging, from a performance point of view. Many legitimate accesses made inside a page that contains a protected structure may induce a severe performance overhead; this makes choosing what structures to protect a very difficult task. Finally, implementing HVMI is often very complex since it often requires reverse-engineering chunks of OS kernel, advanced knowledge about virtualization and, of course, software engineering.</p>

<h2 id="hvmi-history">HVMI History</h2>

<p>HVMI began as a research idea almost 10 years ago (late 2011). The team initially consisted of only one researcher (yours truly), who developed the initial PoC (simple driver-object protection via EPT, to block the TDL rootkit). Once the blessing from the powers that be was received, more time and effort was invested into this research, and the team began to grow. What was initially very straightforward code capable of protecting a handful of non-paged kernel memory pages on Windows 7 grew to become a beast capable of protecting all Windows versions starting with Windows 7, several Linux distros, and, on each of these, even user-mode processes, from various types of attacks.</p>

<p>HVMI was available as a commercial product in 2017, as part of the SVE package – Security for Virtualized Environments. During this time, it was polished, performance was improved, and several new features were developed. In late 2019, we decided to open-source the technology to make it available for everyone to see, use, play with, and extend with new features and capabilities.</p>

<h2 id="how-hvmi-works">How HVMI Works</h2>

<p>In essence, HVMI requires a hypervisor that provides the required API to provide protection. The required API can be explored in the official documentation TODO ref. Once such an API is provided, HVMI places several types of hooks inside the guest. For example, it can intercept control register 3 (CR3 - the register containing the address of the page-tables used for translating linear addresses to physical addresses) – this way, HVMI intercepts context switches inside the guest. By intercepting, for example, SYSCALL MSR writes, HVMI intercepts and blocks attempts to manipulate the SYSCALL entry point address. Most importantly, it uses the EPT to alter physical memory access permissions, thus overriding and restricting access to certain areas of the guest memory.</p>

<h3 id="general-architecture">General Architecture</h3>

<p>The HVMI engine is a standalone library, self-contained (it has no explicit external dependencies), and can be run in user-mode, kernel-mode, or even VMX root-mode. It is written entirely in C, with small bits and pieces written in assembly. The HVMI engine expects an interface containing several API functions to be exposed to it by whatever integrates with it. In this context, the integrator is a tool that binds the HVMI library to a particular hypervisor which provides a uniform API.</p>

<p>Supported hypervisors include our internally built Napoca hypervisor TODO ref, and the well-known open-source hypervisors Xen and KVM. Using the Napoca hypervisor, the HVMI engine runs directly inside VMX root, alongside the HV. In Xen and KVM, the HVMI engine runs as a regular user-mode process inside a special VM (or domain), or even dom0. The general architecture of HVMI is illustrated in the following image:</p>

<p><img src="https://hvmi.github.io/blog/assets/architecture.png" alt="General HVMI architecture on Xen/KVM"></p>

<p>From a functional perspective, HVMI is an event-driven library. When introspection is enabled for a guest VM, HVMI starts by identifying the guest operating system type, version, to find various important structures inside its memory. This process is asynchronous, meaning that once the initialization function returns, there’s no guarantee that HVMI has finished initialization; some parts of the guest introspection process occur when various events take place (for example, when CR3 is written). Once introspection is enabled, HVMI kicks-in when interesting events take-place within the guest; when a process is created or terminated, when a new memory region is allocated inside a protected process, or when memory accesses take place inside a protected region.</p>

<h2 id="making-use-of-hvmi">Making Use of HVMI</h2>

<p>Although we won’t go into very deep details (yet!) regarding the internals of the HVMI engine, here’s a list of the most important features HVMI exposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The list of loaded kernel mode drivers, with load/unload events;</li>
  <li>The list of user-mode processes, with create/terminate events;</li>
  <li>For processes that are protected, the list of loaded user-mode DLLs with load/unload events, and the list of Virtual Address Descriptors for that process with alloc/free events;</li>
  <li>On Windows, access to the Page Frame Number (PFN) Database;</li>
  <li>On Windows, the ability to parse the object tree (this is currently used to search for driver-objects inside guest memory, but it can easily be extended to handle any kind of object);</li>
</ul>

<p>As for OS agnostic features HVMI provides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Guest hardware registers state query;</li>
  <li>Guest physical memory access;</li>
  <li>Ability to place read/write/execute hooks on physical memory;</li>
  <li>Ability to place read/write/execute hooks on virtual memory;</li>
  <li>Ability to place access hooks on control registers;</li>
  <li>Ability to place access hooks on model specific registers;</li>
  <li>Ability to place access hooks on descriptor table registers;</li>
  <li>Ability to intercept exceptions that take place inside the guest (for example, #PF, #BP, etc.);</li>
  <li>Ability inject exceptions inside the guest;</li>
  <li>Access to swapped out guest memory (by injecting #PF inside the guest);</li>
  <li>Ability to hide certain guest memory contents (reads issued inside the guest will be fed with custom values);</li>
  <li>Advanced instruction decoding and handling (the disassembler used by HVMI provides extended information about the decoded instructions, making information extraction and emulation very simple)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="protection-features">Protection features</h3>

<p>The primary purpose of the HVMI engine is to, above all, provide protection. The following list contains the main types of threats HVMI was built to mitigate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Binary exploits inside protected processes;</li>
  <li>Code and data injection techniques inside protected processes;</li>
  <li>Function hooks inside protected processes, on designated system DLLs;</li>
  <li>Rootkits (various techniques are blocked, such as inline hooks inside the kernel or other drivers, SSDT hooks, Driver-object hooks, system register modifications, etc.);</li>
  <li>Kernel exploits;</li>
  <li>Privilege escalation;</li>
  <li>Credentials theft;</li>
  <li>Deep process introspection (prevents process creation if the parent process has been compromised);</li>
  <li>Fileless malware (powershell command line scanning).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="start-contributing">Start Contributing</h2>

<p>We see great potential for the HVMI project, which is why we decided to open-source it and make it available to everyone. Researchers are welcome to clone the project, run it, experiment, and add new features. We also accept pull-requests – if you think your feature is cool enough, be sure to make it available on the main HVMI repo!</p>

<p>Intel is continuously developing new virtualization technologies which make HVMI better and faster. Some of these have already been released, such as the Virtualization Exception (#VE), VM Functions (VMFUNC) and Sub Page Permissions (SPP), and HVMI makes use of them. Others, such as Hypervisor Linear Address Translations (HLAT) have recently been announced, and will make it into silicon in the upcoming years. We are sure that other technologies are yet to come, showing that both hardware vendors and software developers want to invest time and effort to create new virtualization features!</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Service meshes have attracted an enormous amount of hype around them. With at least a few talks about service meshes during each tech conference, one can easily be convinced that having a service mesh in their infrastructure is a must. However, hype isn’t a good indicator of whether the new shiny tech is the right solution for your problems. So below, I’ll try to express an anti-hype opinion on service meshes to hopefully make it less confusing when you want to decide whether you may or may not need one.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/servicemesh/rick.png" alt="rick"></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>There’s a lesson here, and I’m not going to be the one to figure it out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
— Rick Sanchez
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_the_invention">The invention</h3>
<p>Let’s take a step back in history and take a look at one of the <a href="https://eng.lyft.com/envoy-7-months-later-41986c2fd443">early articles</a> about introducing Envoy at Lyft.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>As it turns out, almost every company with a moderately-sized service oriented architecture is having the same problems that Lyft did prior to the development and deployment of Envoy:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An architecture composed of a variety of languages, each containing a half-baked RPC library, including partial (or zero) implementations of rate limiting, circuit breaking, timeouts, retries, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differing or partial implementations of stats, logging, and ….</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>While Envoy is not a service mesh by itself, the outlined problems describe the exact reason why service meshes were invented. They add “rate limiting, circuit breaking, …” and other reliability, observability, and security features to the services by enforcing the communication to go through the service mesh proxies, a data plane. Additionally, they require a separate component, a control plane, to control the configuration.</p>
<p>However, at this point, a lot of people miss the context in which service meshes were introduced. Service meshes are able to solve the problem not because it’s impossible to solve them in any other way. There are many battle-proof RPC libraries that take on the challenges of a separate data plane layer, <a href="https://github.com/twitter/finagle">Finagle</a>, <a href="https://github.com/grpc">gRPC</a>, <a href="https://github.com/line/armeria">Armeria</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apple/servicetalk">Servicetalk</a>, to name a few. After all, the very first service mesh - Linkerd 1.0 <a href="https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd">is powered by Finagle</a>. The RPC libraries will need a component which provides service discovery and configuration management to make it a true mesh. For instance, Zookeeper, or Consul, a component that service meshes call a control plane.</p>
<p>Why introduce a new concept to solve the problems that have been solved before? The service mesh concept wasn’t introduced to address problems that hadn’t been addressed before but rather address them in a way that doesn’t require any modifications to the application code, which is incredibly convenient when it’s hard to introduce an RPC layer into an existing heterogeneous microservice environment.</p>
<p>When you hear service mesh, Istio with Envoy might be the first thing that comes to mind, but it wasn’t the first service mesh to enter the market. Linkerd authors who pioneered the space, described exactly this situation in the <a href="https://linkerd.io/2017/04/25/whats-a-service-mesh-and-why-do-i-need-one/#why-is-the-service-mesh-necessary">"why is the service mesh necessary"</a>. Interestingly, in many hype-y articles on the Internet this context is often forgotten, or omitted.</p>
<p>Solving a problem well, even if it’s a problem that a lot of people have, doesn’t magically provide the tech with a lot of hype. There is always a sponsor behind it. I don’t know who the sponsor was here, and I’m going to speculate, but it’s hard to sell an RPC library in the world where open source is a fundamental requirement. There is no clear business model there, that’s why most of the mature RPC libraries were open-sourced by large tech companies for which it’s not a part of the core business model. A library is just code, not a piece of infrastructure. Service meshes are a different story. It’s an isolated non-trivial piece of infrastructure. As a vendor, not only can you provide consultancy around the configuration and deployment, but you can also sell complete hosted solutions around it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_disillusionments">Disillusionments</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve established the problems, the solution, and most importantly, the context in which the solution was made, let’s take a look at the alternatives. The most obvious one, in the spirit of KISS, is to use an RPC library for your preferred language. Here is where the context is crucial: if you have a large fleet of services, each written in its own language/ecosystem, and the only language that they share is HTTP then having a single shared RPC library is going to be hard. Perhaps, you’ve got a fabric of deployed and running services, but everyone is afraid of touching them, no one knows how they work, and each redeploy is an adventure. A service mesh is here to help you, because at least you’ll be able to roll out new infrastructure features to the mesh regularly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you have a fleet of healthy services written in a single application stack, then it’s a good idea to think twice before introducing a service mesh. By simply introducing or evolving a shared RPC library, you’ll get the exact same benefits and avoid dealing with the downsides of maintaining service meshes. By studying the service mesh limitations thoroughly, you can avoid finding yourself in the trough of disillusionment.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/servicemesh/curve.png" alt="Hype Cycle"></span></p>
<div>
<h4 id="_different_ecosystem">Different ecosystem</h4>
<p>The ecosystem of the service mesh of your choice will likely be different from the ecosystem of your services. Beautiful websites always make you believe that the solution is plug’n’play, always works and never goes down. In reality, sooner or later problems, bugs, quirks in behaviour will reveal themselves, as they always do. At that point, you’ll need to have engineers who work on the service-mesh’s ecosystem which when it’s different from the main app, effectively limits the set of people who can introduce changes or fix problems. This is likely to reintroduce silos, which is against the whole DevOps spirit. Yes, having a DevOps team of engineers who are doing DevOps-y things <a href="https://continuousdelivery.com/2012/10/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-devops-team/">is against DevOps</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_unnecessary_overhead">Unnecessary overhead</h4>
<p>Not only having a proxy in front of each service adds overhead (often significant, talking about <a href="https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/deployment/performance-and-scalability/">90pt</a> rather than 99pt in the performance summary <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/latency-response-time/">doesn’t make software run faster</a>) and consumes resources, but you also requires time (or rather a team of people) to manage them. Yes, it can help to make some of the tasks potentially easier - yay, you can now add canary deployments with a few lines of YAML to simple applications now. However, you still need to manage canary deployments of the proxies themselves which don’t have a proxy in front of them. The problems just get pushed up the stack.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_limiting_your_architecture_to_what_the_proxy_supports">Limiting your architecture to what The Proxy supports.</h4>
<p>As you’re reading this paragraph, HTTP/3 is slowly being rolled out to the Internet. It uses UDP as transport. Why use UDP rather than create a completely new protocol you ask? That’s because anything but TCP and UDP is simply “blocked” by the boxes, various proxies on the internet - routers, gateways, etc. This phenomenon got named <a href="https://http3-explained.haxx.se/en/why-quic/why-ossification">ossification</a>. So, only TCP or UDP are left is the practical chose, and even UDP is partially blocked by various corporate proxies which slows down the adoption.</p>
<p>Even though your microservice environment is probably much smaller compared to the Internet, you can draw parallels with service meshes. Proxies can ossify your application architecture by limiting how your services talk to each other, and there is not much benefit in having proxies if you can bypass them. Suppose you want to build a reactive application which is using RSocket over pure tcp? Or perhaps a message-driven application using an actor model? Or maybe push the performance boundaries with Aeron? Not going to happen until the box in the middle becomes aware of the protocol.</p>

<h3 id="_do_i_need_one">Do I need one?</h3>
<p>What does it all mean for you as an engineer? The answer to whether you need to adopt the service mesh approach comes down to the state of the microservice environment you’re trying to improve. As we have established, compared to an RPC framework, service meshes allow you to:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Deploy the infra changes more often than deploying your services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduce infra changes without touching the service code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>The point 1. is important when for whatever reason you can’t redeploy your services very often, e.g. maybe no one remembers how it’s done anymore, or maybe there are other restrictions. The point 2. is important when your stack is heterogeneous, e.g. some services are built in Go, some in Java, some in Haskell, etc. Where are you on the interval from a huge set of heterogeneous services with unknown deployment schedules to a set of homogenous regularly deployed services defines whether a service mesh is the best solution for you.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Service meshes have a lot of hype around them, and way too much in my opinion. However, before committing to a piece of technology, it’s crucial to understand the problems it solves, and the context in which the solution was made. A service mesh is not an ultimate “good practice” but simply one of the patterns to solve a set of issues, and it’s quite a heavy one.</p>
<p>Rather than jumping on board, look carefully - the last thing you want is to find out that you have invested in a solution for a problem that you don’t have. Service meshes are an amazing piece of tech solving a whole lot of problems. Not in every case, it is the best solution.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        

<p>As usual, when a new blog post comes out on <a href="https://blog.golang.org/">blog.golang.org</a>, I’m all
eager to read it as soon as possible. The most recent one, <a href="https://blog.golang.org/contributors-summit">Contributors
Summit</a>, is a nice write-up on the issues that the Go
contributors have been talking about. While reading it, I stumbled upon a sentence that made me
write this post. Here is is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For instance, it would be nice if io.Reader accepted a context so that blocking read operations
could be canceled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This gave me chills. This is what <code>io.Reader</code> would look like with a context.</p>

<pre><code>type Reader interface {
        Read(ctx context.Context, p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
</code></pre>

<p>I did some research and found that some people already <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20280">proposed this
change</a> for Go 2. Thankfully it received a decent amount
of thumbs down, so it’s likely not making it.</p>

<p>This post is about all of the things that are wrong with the <code>"context"</code> package, why it is useful
 despite that, and that Go 2 should do something about it. So, grab some popcorn and let’s get
 started!</p>

<h2 id="go-is-a-general-purpose-language">Go is a general purpose language</h2>

<p>First things first, let’s establish some ground. Go is a <em>good</em> language for writing servers, but Go
is not a <em>language for writing servers</em>. Go is a <em>general purpose programming language</em>, just like
C, C++, Java or Python. For example, I’ve been using Go for about 2 years and I’ve never written a
single server in it.</p>

<p>For this reason, when designing the Go language and it’s standard library, we need to approach it
from a general purpose language perspective. Now, I’m not trying to say that context is only useful
for server people. But mostly, it is.</p>

<h2 id="context-is-like-a-virus">Context is like a virus</h2>

<p>This is the first and most important problem with context: it spreads! As mentioned in <a href="https://blog.golang.org/context">this blog
post about the context package</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At Google, we require that Go programmers pass a Context parameter as the first argument to every
function on the call path between incoming and outgoing requests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every such function also needs to propagate the context down it’s call path, or else it wouldn’t be
fully cancelable. This means that all the potentially slow functions from other libraries that are
being called from a function accepting a context should also accept a context.</p>

<p>In short, if you’re writing a library that has function which can take some significant amount of
time and your library is <em>potentially</em> going to be used by a server application, you have to accept
a context in those functions.</p>

<p>That’s how context spreads like a virus. What’s bad about that? Let’s recap:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go is a general purpose language.</li>
<li>If a library is <em>potentially</em> going to be used by a server, it should accept a context.</li>
<li>Now, everyone has to deal with the context, even the ones who don’t need it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, I can just pass <code>context.TODO()</code> everywhere, but that’s just gross, it hurts readability,
makes my code look ugly and simply removes a part of fun I have with Go.</p>

<p>If the Go language ever comes to the point where I’d have to write this</p>

<pre><code>n, err := r.Read(context.TODO(), p)
</code></pre>

<p>put a bullet in my head, please.</p>

<p>You might argue: <em>A library can provide two version of each function, one with a context and one
without a context.</em> Sure, just take a look at the
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/"><code>"database/sql"</code></a> package. Although it does solve the problem
partially, it smells quite bad.</p>

<p>Also, imagine teaching Go to a student. You start explaining the context-equipped <code>io.Reader</code>
interface (or anything else which occasionally requires a context) to them and they ask: <em>What is
that <code>ctx context.Context</code> thingy there?</em> And the answer would probably just be: <em>Don’t worry about
that, just pass <code>context.TODO()</code> there for now.</em> Sounds a lot like <code>public static void</code> to me.</p>

<p>The message is: Context spreads like a virus and I (alongside almost everyone who doesn’t write
servers in Go) don’t want to deal with it when I don’t have to.</p>

<h2 id="the-context-package-itself-is-not-that-good">The <code>"context"</code> package itself is not that good</h2>

<p>The first thing is a personal opinion, but for me, the <code>context.Context</code> interface has too many
methods. Now, the more serious problems.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-use-ctx-value-in-my-non-existent-company-you-re-fired">If you use <code>ctx.Value</code> in my (non-existent) company, you’re fired</h3>

<p>I’m not sure who came up with this idea that context should carry a map of meaningless objects to
meaningless objects. There are just so many things that are wrong with it. Let’s list a few:</p>

<ol>
<li>An obvious one, it’s not statically typed at all.</li>
<li>It requires documenting which values (keys and their types) a certain function supports and uses.
As we all know, documentation is mostly a code that never runs.</li>
<li>It’s very similar to thread-local storage. We know how bad of an idea thread-local storage is.
Non-flexible, complicates usage, composition, testing.</li>
<li>This probably doesn’t happen often, but it’s prone to name collisions.</li>
<li>It’s just magic. An error-prone magic.</li>
</ol>

<p>I know that <code>ctx.Value</code> makes some things easier. But, I believe that designing your APIs without
<code>ctx.Value</code> in mind at all makes it always possible to come up with alternatives.</p>

<h3 id="context-is-mostly-an-inefficient-linked-list">Context is mostly an inefficient linked list</h3>

<p>The way <code>WithCancel</code>, <code>WithDeadline</code>, etc. constructors from the <code>"context"</code> package work is they
create a linked list. Among other things, this sometimes requires creating a
<a href="https://golang.org/src/context/context.go#L261">goroutine</a> for <code>WithCancel</code>, which propagates
cancelation signals from the previous context to the new one. Of course, if the context is never
canceled, this goroutine is leaked.</p>

<p>The <code>WithValue</code> constructor takes a context and returns a context which propagates the previous
context but also contains a value under the specified key. This is, obviously, achieved by creating
another node in the linked list, the purpose of which is to return the correct value for that key
and propagate the previous context otherwise. So, <code>ctx.Value</code> is not only a map of meaningless
objects to meaningless objects, it’s also a terribly slow map of meaningless objects to meaningless
objects.</p>

<h3 id="and-lastly">And lastly</h3>

<pre><code>ctx context.Context
</code></pre>

<p>is a lot like</p>

<pre><code>Foo foo = new Foo();
</code></pre>

<p>One of the things Go was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnDgT73v8s">created to avoid</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-the-context-package-actually-solve">What does the <code>"context"</code> package actually solve?</h2>

<p>Despite all of the bad things described above, the <code>"context"</code> package is genuinely useful, because
it solves one thing that is kinda hard to do in Go: <strong>cancelation</strong>. That’s the only problem the
<code>"context"</code> package really solves (or attempts to solve).</p>

<p>Let’s face it, cancelation in Go is hard. There is a whole talk called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDDwwePbDtw">‘Advanced Go Concurrency
Patterns’</a>, which discusses this problem in depth. This
talk happened before the <code>"context"</code> package was introduced into the Go standard library and thus it
discusses solutions to the cancelation problem which only involve simple channels.</p>

<p>There are number of reasons why solutions proposed in the talk don’t scale very well. Here are a few
of them:</p>

<ol>
<li>The cancelation channels are usually not accepted by other libraries and functions and thus
cancelation is only possible ‘in-between’ the slow operations.</li>
<li>Considering a ‘tree of goroutines’ (where children goroutines are the ones spawned by the parent
goroutines), it’s easy to cancel the whole tree (just close the cancelation channel), but it’s
harder to cancel a sub-tree (you need to introduce another channel for that, or some other
solution).</li>
</ol>

<p>The <code>"context"</code> package does solve these problems. Inefficiently and with numerous problems, but
solves them better than anything else out there. <strong>In Go, we need to be able to solve the
cancelation problem</strong>. Solving it is usually necessary anytime a decent usage of goroutines is
involved.</p>

<h2 id="go-2-should-explicitly-address-the-cancelation-problem">Go 2 should explicitly address the cancelation problem</h2>

<p>I think it’s a weakness of the Go programming language that we needed to introduce a package like
<code>"context"</code>. Go makes it very easy to create goroutines and communicate between them. However, the
<code>"context"</code> package is a proof that Go makes it hard enough to <em>arrange goroutines to finish</em>. I
believe this problem should be solved directly in the language. The language should provide a
solution, which is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Simple and elegant.</li>
<li>Optional, non-intrusive and non-infectious.</li>
<li>Robust and efficient.</li>
<li>Only solves the cancelation problem. Values can be omitted. Timeouts can also be implemented on
top of a very simple cancelation.</li>
</ol>

<p>You might argue: <em>I like context, it’s an elegant solution to the problem without changing or
complicating the language</em>. I disagree. For all the reasons described above it’s not an elegant
solution and although it’s not an integral part of the language, it is and is becoming more and more
an integral part of the libraries. In the end, it makes the language harder to use.</p>

<p>I have a few solutions in mind, but I’ll leave them for another post or a proposal, or I’ll leave
them for myself if someone comes up with a better solution. The purpose of this post is just to
point out the problem.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This post was trying to point out a problem in the Go language. In short, cancelation is a problem
in Go and the <code>"context"</code> package does not solve this problem very well. I can’t think of any other
solution that would solve this problem good except for a language change. That is up for Go 2.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and I’m looking forward to your feedback and <del>hate comments</del> objections ;).</p>

So if you are all about living life to the fullest and improving yourself as a person, then why would you not transfer this concept of note-taking to your own personal life?</p> <p>One of the best thing <em>writing</em> things down can do for you is to <strong>sharpen your thinking</strong>. Sitting down and putting the work to synthesizing your thoughts can help to produce better quality ideas. If I find myself having an abstract thought in my head that it is hard to express in words, penning them down can help to solidify and refine the idea.</p> <p>In the rest of the article, I will be going through my note-taking journey, and the various techniques &amp; concepts I use to make my note-taking more effective.</p> <h2 id="active-recall-and-spaced-repetition">Active Recall and Spaced Repetition</h2> <p>When I was a student in junior college studying for ‘A’ Levels, the content we were learning were becoming more and more complex. So I started searching up study techniques to optimize my learning.</p> <p>I came across <a href="https://youtu.be/ukLnPbIffxE">Ali Abdaal’s YouTube videos</a> on <em>Active Recall</em> and <em>Spaced Repetition</em>, and these techniques stuck with me till this day. These were legitimate, scientifically backed<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> advice, in contrast to the plethora of “<em>Top 101 Study Tips</em>” listicles online that sounds good but doesn’t work.</p> <p>(Spoiler alert: Active Recall trumps other study techniques like rereading, highlighting and blindly writing notes, in terms of examination performance.)</p> <p> <strong>Active Recall</strong><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>: <em>This involves retrieving information from your brain after learning something, typically through testing yourself. The act of recalling strengthens your ability to retain your information and solidifies the connections in our brain between different concepts.</em> <br><strong>Spaced Repetition</strong><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>: <em>The act of reviewing materials at spaced intervals. This is effective in memory retention and countering the forgetting curve.</em> </p> <p>If you ever want to learn something effectively, it is key to utilize both techniques to maximize your retention rate.</p> <h2 id="second-brain">Second Brain</h2> <p>On the never-ending quest for maximum productivity, I chanced upon an <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/">article by Forte Labs</a> that explained this conundrum I had in my head:</p> <blockquote> <p>How many brilliant ideas have you had and forgotten? How many insights have you failed to take action on? How much useful advice have you slowly forgotten as the years have passed?</p> <p>We feel a constant pressure to be learning, improving ourselves, and making progress. We spend countless hours every year reading, listening, and watching informational content. And yet, where has all that valuable knowledge gone? Where is it when we need it? Our brain can only store a few thoughts at any one time. Our brain is for <em>having</em> ideas, not storing them.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Without a little extra care to preserve these valuable resources, our precious knowledge remains siloed and scattered across dozens of different locations.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mind = Blown 🤯. This perpetual problem that has always bothered my mind (but could never find the words for it) was perfectly articulated by this excerpt.</p> <p>The article then introduced a solution: <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">Building A Second Brain</a>. BASB is a methodology for “preserving your ideas, and turning them into reality”. The article explains it like this:</p> <blockquote> <p>We are constantly generating ideas. Yet, without a little extra care to preserve these valuable resources, our precious knowledge remains siloed and scattered across dozens of different locations.</p> <p>By offloading our thinking onto a “second brain,” we free our biological brain to imagine, create, and simply be present.</p> </blockquote> <p>Information overload is a plague of today’s society. Building a digital system where you can deposit all your thoughts and learnings there is quintessential for knowledge workers in this day and age.</p> <p>Another similar concept is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management">Personal Knowledge System</a>. PKM involves the bottom-up approach of <em>collecting information that a person uses to gather, classify, store, search, retrieve and share knowledge in their daily activities.</em><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p> <h2 id="note-taking-app-roam-research">Note-Taking App: Roam Research</h2> <p><i>(This segment talks about my favourite note-taking app, Roam Research. If you wish to skip to the next segment of the article, click <a href="#how_i_take_notes">here.</a>)</i></p> <p>In search for an appropriate medium for BASB, I discovered <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>. I have been using it ever since and have never looked back.</p> <picture> <img src="https://www.ivan-ang.com/assets/roam-showcase.png" height="100%" width="100%"> <figure> <figcaption><b>Source:</b> <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>'s official site.</figcaption> </figure> </picture> <h3 id="what-makes-roam-different-from-the-other-note-taking-apps">What makes Roam different from the other note-taking apps?</h3> <p>Note-taking apps typically function <strong>hierarchically</strong>.</p> <p>You create categories, and within each categories are sub-categories and within them contain notes. The problem with this is that we face the issue of deciding where to put these notes under, since they can belong to multiple categories.</p> <p>Roam Research is a note-taking application for <strong>networked thought</strong>.</p> <p>It seeks to make note-taking function more like how a brain processes information. Whenever you have an idea, your brain will create multiple associations to it. Thinking of linked concepts will help you recall that idea.</p> <p>Likewise, Roam seeks to associate notes with other notes via <em>bi-directional linking</em>, making it easier to connect your ideas. It becomes your second brain. Your notes do not just sit there idly like other note apps. Roam encourages serendipity and <em>Spaced Repetition</em> by letting you to continuously revisit past notes.</p> <p>For those tinkerers out there, you can even create your own custom CSS and JavaScript themes! (Shameless plug: check out my theme <a href="https://github.com/hiivan/CyanoRoam">CyanoRoam</a> on Github).</p> <h3 id="pricing">Pricing</h3> <p>The bummer is that after their 31-days free trial, they start with a whopping $15/month and $7.50/month for students afterwards. If you are not willing to spend that much money on it, I recommend looking into other <a href="https://nesslabs.com/roam-research-alternatives">Roam alternatives</a> like <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> and <a href="https://giffmex.org/experiments/stroll.experiment.html">TiddlyStroll</a>.</p> <p>(I was lucky enough to have been part of their beta program so my graph is free indefinitely 😁.)</p> <p>If you are interested to know more about how Roam Research works, you can also check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpikCLhpIRY">Ali Abdaal’s video on Roam</a>.</p>  <h2 id="how-i-take-notes">How I Take Notes.</h2> <p>Personal Knowledge System/Building A Second Brain or whatever you want to call it, below are the multiple facets of how I take my notes. See and pick what works for you.</p> <h3 id="quick-capture">📸Quick Capture</h3> <p>Our brains are constantly coming up with new ideas. Sometimes, this can get very distracting and take away from what we are currently focusing on.</p> <p>A way I have come up to curb this problem is that whenever I come up with a new idea or inspiration, I will immediately <strong>capture them</strong> down on Roam.</p> <p>I keep quotes, reading highlights, podcast insights and everything you can think of. I find this very liberating as it helps to take the load off my brain so I can focus what is important presently.</p> <p>Then, at the end of the day, I can go back to review whatever I have written the entire day, and decide whether I will add them to the list of stuff to work on.</p> <h3 id="bookpodcastarticle-notes">📚Book/Podcast/Article Notes</h3> <p>This is the most obvious kind of note-taking: writing notes on stuff you read.</p> <p>Whenever I read, or other content I consume online e.g. podcasts, articles, I try my best to paraphrase and summarize every book. Especially when coming across a foreign concept that I wish to learn more on, I find it best to actively engage with the material for better learning.</p> <p>Take note <em>(pun intended)</em>: When taking notes, paraphrase and try not to refer back to the material at hand. This is the essence behind <em>Active Recall</em>.</p> <h3 id="️quantifying-my-productivity">⚖️Quantifying My Productivity</h3> <p>I subscribe to the notion of the <strong>1% Rule</strong>: if you improve yourself by 1% everyday for one year, you will end up 3800% better than where you started off a year ago. I first read this from James Clear, the author of the best-selling book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a>.</p> <picture> <img src="https://www.ivan-ang.com/assets/marginal-gains.jpg" height="85%" width="85%"> <figure> <figcaption><b>Source:</b> <a href="https://jamesclear.com/marginal-gains">Marginal Gains</a> by James Clear. <br><i>"Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement."</i></figcaption> </figure> </picture> <p>Of course, in reality, the metric to quantify your productivity is slightly more unclear, and you might not exactly be 38x better. But the 1% Rule proves how powerful compound interest can be and how it can do wonders to your life.</p> <p>I follow a simple system of quantifying my output to track my productivity. I have a section called <span>⏳Timeline of My Life</span>. In there, I record down the notable things that I have learnt or accomplished that day, or when I have reached a certain milestone in my life.</p> <p>This is especially useful if you wish to do <strong>weekly reviews</strong> on your personal development.</p> <p>Looking at all your past notes can give you a birds-eye view of what you have accomplished the entire week. By reviewing, you are applying <em>Spaced Repetition</em> to your learning. Occasionally looking back at the mini-achievements you have done can also do wonders to your motivation and self-esteem :P.</p> <p>I am considering using a software tool like <a href="https://airtable.com/">Airtable</a> in the future to relegate this mini-project to.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The goal of this post is to review well-adopted ideas that have stood the test of time. I will present a small set of techniques that cover a lot of basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research. If you're new to the field, these are a great starting point.</p><div id="post-content"><p>Deep Learning is an extremely fast-moving field and the huge number of research papers and ideas can be overwhelming. Even seasoned researchers have a hard time telling company PR from real breakthroughs. The goal of this post is to review those ideas that have <strong>stood the test of time</strong>, which is perhaps the only significance test one should rely on. These ideas, or improvements of them, have been used over and over again. They're known to work.</p> <p>If you were to start in Deep Learning today, understanding and implementing each of these techniques would give you an excellent foundation for understanding recent research and working on your own projects. It's what I believe the best way to get started. Working through papers in historical order is also a useful exercise to understand where the current techniques come from and why they were invented in the first place. <strong><strong>Put another way, I will try to present a <em>minimal set</em> of ideas that most of the basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research.</strong></strong></p> <p>A rather unique thing about Deep Learning is that its application domains (Vision, Natural Language, Speech, RL, etc) share the majority of techniques. For example, someone who has worked in Deep Learning for Computer Vision his whole career could quickly be productive in NLP research. The specific network architectures may differ, but the concepts, approaches and code are mostly the same. I will try to present ideas from various fields, but there are a few caveats about this list:</p> <ul> <li>My goal is not to give in-depth explanations or code examples for these techniques. It's not easily possible to summarize long complex papers into a single paragraph. Instead, I will give a brief overview of each technique, its historical context, and links to papers and implementations. If you want to learn something, I <em>highly recommend</em> trying to re-produce some of these paper results from scratch in raw <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> without using existing code bases or high-level libraries.</li> <li>The list is biased towards my own knowledge and the fields I am familiar with. There are many exciting subfields that I don't have experience with. I will stick to what most people would consider the popular mainstream domains of Vision, Natural Language, Speech, and Reinforcement Learning / Games.</li> <li>I will only discuss research that has official or semi-official open source implementations that are known to work well. Some research isn't easily reproducible because it involves huge engineering challenges, for example <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">DeepMind's AlphaGo</a> or <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">OpenAI's Dota 2 AI</a>, so I won't highlight it here.</li> <li>Some choices are arbitrary. Often, rather similar techniques are published at around the same time. The goal of this post is not be a comprehensive review, but to to expose someone new to the field to a cross-section of ideas that cover a lot of ground. For example, there may be hundreds of GAN variations, but to understand the general concept of GANs, it really doesn't matter which one you study.</li> </ul>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks">ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (2012)</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_imagenet_2012">Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton (2012)</span></li> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0580">Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature detectors (2012)</a> <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al.

It is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network based on the earlier LeNet developed by Yann LeCun. AlexNet beat previous methods at classifying images from the <a href="http://image-net.org/index">ImageNet dataset</a> by a significant margin through a combination of GPU power and algorithmic advances. It demonstrated that neural networks actually work! AlexNet was also one of the first times Dropout <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al.

These days, software libraries such as PyTorch are so powerful, and compared to more recent architectures AlexNet is so simple, that it can be implemented in only a few lines of code. Note that many implementations of AlexNet, such as those linked above, use the slight variation of the network described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5997">One weird trick for parallelizing convolutional neural networks</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_one_2014">Krizhevsky (2014)</span>.</p>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602">Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning (2013)</a> <span data-cites="mnih_playing_2013">Mnih et al.

What's more, the <em>same</em> neural network architecture learned to play seven different games without being told any game-specific rules, demonstrating the generality of the approach.</p> <p>Reinforcement Learning differs from Supervised Learning, such as image classification, in that an agent must learn maximize to the sum of rewards over multiple time steps, such as winning a game, instead of just predicting a label. Because the agent interacts directly with the environment and each action affects the next, the training data is not independent and identically distributed (iid), which makes the training of many Machine Learning models quite unstable. This was solved by using techniques such as experience replay <span data-cites="lin_self-improving_1992">Lin (1992)</span>.</p> <p>While there was no obvious algorithmic innovation that made this work, the research cleverly combined existing techniques, convolutional neural networks trained on GPUs and experience replay, with a few data processing tricks to achieve impressive results that most people would not have expected. This gave people confidence in extending Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques to tackle even more complex tasks such as <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">Go</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">Dota 2</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii">Starcraft 2</a>, and others.</p> <p>Atari Games <span data-cites="bellemare_arcade_2013">Bellemare et al.

One particular game, Montezuma’s Revenge, was famous for requiring long-term planning and was considered to be among the most difficult to solve.

        <h2 id="backstory-and-first-attempts">Backstory and first attempts</h2>
<p>As I mentioned in my last post I’ve been working on reverse engineering the PLA chip in the C128.
I’m now mostly done with this process so I think it’s time to share some of the findings.</p>
<p>This has been a very interesting project as I did not really know much about semiconductor design
and manufacturing. My existing knowledge extended to having seen some die shots and admiring the pretty
looking pictures.</p>
<p>It all started with me buying a cheap microscope to help with soldering surface mount components.</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/cheapo-microscope.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Cheap microscope">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/cheapo-microscope.jpg" alt="Cheap microscope">
</a>
</p>
<p>Some time later I ended up watching a video on youtube showing a simpler way of getting silicon dies out
of the packaging.</p>


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZQeHHYJYWXo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>This looked simple enough to try at home as I already had all the equipment needed. Decapping an IC usually involves heated sulphuric acid or
other similar nasty chemicals which I do not really want to play with at home. So I dug out a couple of broken MOS chips I had lying around
(never throw things away, could come in handy). After fiddling around a bit I ended up with two 8521R0 dies and one 8721 PLA.
The first real photo was the one show in the last post.</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/now-available/pla-die.png" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Full 8721 PLA die photo">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/now-available/pla-die.png" alt="Full 8721 PLA die photo">
</a>
</p>
<h2 id="better-microscope">Better microscope</h2>
<p>While this was a success I quickly realised that this microscope did not have enough resolution for me to be able to capture images of high
enough quality. The maximum magnification is 90x, when using a 2x barlow lens. Additionally it does not have a stage so I had to place the die
on a table and then move the whole microscope, which is very unstable and makes it hard to capture the bits you want to see.</p>
<p>As such a better microscope was sourced and purchased, still within reasonable money.</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/amscope-me580t.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="AmScope ME580-T microscope">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/amscope-me580t.jpg" alt="AmScope ME580-T microscope">
</a>
</p>
<p>This proved to be much better at taking pictures of decent quality, I was however not happy with the camera I bought with it. It’s a cheap camera with no capability for me to manage it remotely except using the AmScope application. Around this time, the Raspberry Pi foundation
released the new High Quality camera for the Raspberry Pi. This camera has a C-mount on it which matches the microscope so I quickly bought
one and put in on the microscope. This camera is fantastic for this job, full control of the whole process from the comfort of linux.</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/8521r0-detail.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Silicon die detail from 8521R0">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/8521r0-detail.jpg" alt="Silicon die detail from 8521R0">
</a>
</p>
<p>All in all a vast improvement to the previous setup. With the higher resolution I started needing to stitch the photos together to make
larger pictures. This sounded simple at the start and ended up being (as you can probably guess) not very easy at all. I’m still struggling
with the stitching, but slowly improving. One of the key things for a successful panorama stitch is to have consistent photos when it comes
to panning, focus, white balance etc. etc. The more even the photos, the easier and better the stitching becomes.</p>
<h2 id="motorizing">Motorizing</h2>
<p>This led me to start working on motorizing the table. It was getting really tiresome having to manually move the table around and the photos
ended up being moved in multiple axis etc.</p>
<p>Lots of design work, 3D printing and research into CNC firmwares later I ended up with the following setup:</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/modded-me580t.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Modified AmScope ME580-T microscope">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/modded-me580t.jpg" alt="Modified AmScope ME580-T microscope">
</a>
</p>
<p>Going from the top we have a Raspberry 7” display, with a Raspberry Pi4 mounted on the back. Not see is also the RPi HiQ camera mounted on
the microscope. The RPi takes photos, displays previews on the display and also runs the python code that controls the CNC board.</p>
<p>The stage and the levelling table is motorized with 28BYJ-48 steppers controlled using a small board with an ESP32 running <a href="https://github.com/bdring/Grbl_Esp32">Grbl_Esp32</a> and four AD4498 stepper motor controllers.</p>
<p>This whole setup has some issues both in software and hardware but it works well enough for now to enable me to do some work.</p>

<p>With the logistics now sorted out I returned to the work of reverse engineering the chip itself. My initial focus was on the PLA chip
as this should be one of the simpler ones to figure out. PLA stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_array">Programmable Logic Array</a> and is a very common structure in designs from this era.</p>
<p>Looking at the schematic diagram from wikipedia we should expect to see two main arrays, AND and OR. Inputs are connected to AND and
outputs from the OR array.</p>
<p>Going back to the previous die shot with can improve it with some annotations for the pins and the general areas of the chip. Once we
have established the pins we can see that all the inputs are connected to one array and all the outputs to the other array, just as
expected. This also helps us establish which array is which.</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/pla-annotated.png" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Annotated die shot of 8721 PLA">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/pla-annotated.png" alt="Annotated die shot of 8721 PLA">
</a>
</p>
<p>Here we see the I/O pins marked up with how they are connected to the lead frame and the pins on the DIP itself. We can also see the two main
areas that make up a PLA structure, the AND array and the OR array. Additionally there is some extra logic at the bottom marked with a question
mark. The function of this was unknown to me but as all the output pins are passing through it I was guessing that it was an output stage of
some kind.</p>
<h2 id="and-array">AND array</h2>
<p>So, if we take a closer look at the AND matrix to start with we will see the following. The colours are a bit off as this was still done
using the AmScope camera and I didn’t figure out how to set the white balance on it.</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/and-matrix-metal.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="AND matrix with metal layer">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/and-matrix-metal.jpg" alt="AND matrix with metal layer">
</a>
</p>
<p>This was not very helpful to understand what was going on as all the interesting bits are covered up by the top-most metal layer. This was
early on when I was still learning a lot so to remove the metal I took a very brute force approach. I use heavy mechanical scrubbing to
remove the metal which I also learned once I put it back in the microscope had removed everything but the substrate itself. Oops.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the details that I needed were in the diffusion embedded into the substrate:</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/and-matrix-delayer.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="AND matrix substrate">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/and-matrix-delayer.jpg" alt="AND matrix substrate">
</a>
</p>
<p>Looking closely at this image we can see little squiggly lines where a transistor is located to create a connection within the matrix.</p>
<h2 id="or-array">OR array</h2>
<p>Moving on to the OR array we see the exact same pattern. Hard to tell with the metal layer in place, though easier compared to the AND
matrix. Much easier with just the substrate and diffusion left.</p>


<h2 id="full-matrix-decode">Full matrix decode</h2>
<p>Armed with this knowledge we can now proceed with extracting the full PLA logic matrix from the images.</p>
<p>I marked all transistors in each matrix with a dot and got the following picture:</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/decoded-matrix.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="AND matrix with metal layer">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/decoded-matrix.jpg" alt="AND matrix with metal layer">
</a>
</p>
<p>All inputs are horizontal in the AND matrix, with each line having a normal and an inverted signal being fed in.
All outputs are horizontal in the OR matrix and they are connected with vertical lines called product terms.</p>
<p>By looking at the dots, we can decode the product terms by doing logic and for all vertical lines in the AND matrix, for example</p>
<pre><code>    p0 = CHAREN &amp; HIRAM &amp; BA &amp; !MS3 &amp; GAME &amp; RW &amp; AEC &amp; A12 &amp; !A13 &amp; A14 &amp; A15
</code></pre><p>For the outputs we instead look horizontal for each output and combine with or, for example</p>
<pre><code>    SDEN = p42 | p43 | p66 | p69
</code></pre><p>So now we have the entire set of logic equations. Hooray!</p>
<h2 id="output-stage">Output stage</h2>
<p>Going back to the full die picture, we now have everything but the box marked with a question mark in the output path.</p>
<p>Looking at higher resolution photos of this we can see similar structures for each output. In all cases except two the structure
is bypassed and the output from the OR matrix goes directly to the output pin. This is however not the case for the two pins <code>DWE</code> and <code>CASENB</code>.</p>
<p><code>DWE</code> is the Write Enable signal going to the main system DRAM chips, CASENB is gating the CAS signal towards the RAM. These two signals are
processed in some form using these output gate structures, so I had to reverse engineer this block.</p>


<p>After quite some time reading up on silicon chip design and manufacturing and a lot of attempts I managed to come up with a schematic
for this that makes sense. I’m not going to go into the whole process here but I will document and post it later. Here I would also like
to thank <a href="https://www.patreon.com/androSID">Frank Wolf</a> for his help, please support his project if you can!</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/output-schematic.png" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Output block schematic">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/output-schematic.png" alt="Output block schematic">
</a>
</p>
<p>Going a bit further, the way this is used in the <code>DWE</code> and <code>CASENB</code> outputs makes it a normal D-latch. The latch enable for this also comes
for the PLA matrix in a pair of lines in the OR matrix.</p>
<h2 id="result">Result</h2>
<p>So as a final result we can now write down the full HDL code for the C128 PLA chip. I’m using verilog for this. Mind you this is the first
verilog I’ve ever written so it’s probably suboptimal. Using a D-latch for the output in verilog is normally seen as a bad thing, however
in this case I am doing it to replicate the logic and function of the existing chip.</p>
<p>I have validated this to the best of my knowledge, but if I’ve missed anything please let me know!</p>
<p>In difference to the C64 PLA the C128 PLA can not be replaced with just an EPROM or similar due to the presence of the output latches.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>Using Python, we want to convert words to numbers. In this challenge, we will explore how to convert a string into an integer.</p>
<p>The strings simply represent the numbers in words.</p>
<h3>Examples:</h3>
<ul><li>“one” =&gt; 1</li><li>“twenty” =&gt; 20</li><li>“two hundred forty-six” =&gt; 246</li><li>“seven hundred eighty-three thousand nine hundred and nineteen” =&gt; 783919</li></ul>
<h3>Additional Notes:</h3>
<ul><li>The minimum number is “zero” (inclusively)</li><li>The maximum number, which must be supported is 1 million (inclusively)</li><li>The “and” in e.g. “one hundred and twenty-four” is optional, in some cases it’s present and in others, it’s not</li><li>All tested numbers are valid, you don’t need to validate them</li></ul>
<h2>Test cases</h2>
<pre title="">Test.assert_equals(parse_int('one'), 1)
Test.assert_equals(parse_int('twenty'), 20)
Test.assert_equals(parse_int('two hundred forty-six'), 246)
</pre>
<h2>The solution in Python</h2>
<pre title="">def parse_int(textnum, numwords={}):
    # create our default word-lists
    if not numwords:

      # singles
      units = [
        "zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight",
        "nine", "ten", "eleven", "twelve", "thirteen", "fourteen", "fifteen",
        "sixteen", "seventeen", "eighteen", "nineteen",
      ]

      # tens
      tens = ["", "", "twenty", "thirty", "forty", "fifty", "sixty", "seventy", "eighty", "ninety"]

      # larger scales
      scales = ["hundred", "thousand", "million", "billion", "trillion"]

      # divisors
      numwords["and"] = (1, 0)

      # perform our loops and start the swap
      for idx, word in enumerate(units):    numwords[word] = (1, idx)
      for idx, word in enumerate(tens):     numwords[word] = (1, idx * 10)
      for idx, word in enumerate(scales):   numwords[word] = (10 ** (idx * 3 or 2), 0)

    # primary loop
    current = result = 0
    # loop while splitting to break into individual words
    for word in textnum.replace("-"," ").split():
        # if problem then fail-safe
        if word not in numwords:
          raise Exception("Illegal word: " + word)

        # use the index by the multiplier
        scale, increment = numwords[word]
        current = current * scale + increment
        
        # if larger than 100 then push for a round 2
        if scale &gt; 100:
            result += current
            current = 0

    # return the result plus the current
    return result + current
</pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="grid-body">
<article>
      <p>Happy release day! We are excited to announce Snowpack v2.7 with a handful of new features improving stability and the overall developer experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Redesigned plugin API</strong> plus <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/plugins">new guides for plugin authors</a></li>
<li><strong>Import aliasing</strong> and new ways to customize Snowpack</li>
<li><strong>Improved build performance</strong> with smaller, faster builds</li>
<li><strong>New Svelte + TypeScript</strong> app templates</li>
<li><strong>Bug fixes, usability improvements &amp; more!</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Plus, we hit some VERY exciting project milestones last month:</p>
<ul>
<li>❤️ <strong>150</strong> <a href="https://github.com/pikapkg/snowpack/graphs/contributors">open source contributors</a> (and growing!)</li>
<li>🏆 <strong>1000+</strong> discussions, issues, and pull requests</li>
<li>⭐️ <strong>10,000+</strong> stars on GitHub</li>
<li>👋 <strong>New companies using Snowpack:</strong> <a href="https://www.1688.com/">Alibaba</a> &amp; <a href="https://airhacks.com/">Airhacks</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve been waiting for an excuse to give Snowpack a try, now is a great time to start! Try out a Create Snowpack App (CSA) template or install Snowpack into any existing project:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> --save-dev snowpack<p><br><span>yarn</span> <span>add</span> --dev snowpack</p></code></pre>
<h2 id="redesigned-plugin-api">Redesigned Plugin API</h2>
<p>Snowpack v2.7 features an major rewrite of our&nbsp;internal build pipeline to support a more reliable and expressive plugin API. New optimizations and file type builders are unlocked with the redesigned <code>load()</code>, <code>transform()</code>, <code>run()</code> and <code>optimize()</code> plugin hooks (with more on the way in future versions).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/snowpack-27-screenshot-1.png" alt="snowpack screenshot"></p>
<p>Snowpack 2.7 is fully backwards compatible with older plugins, so you can upgrade Snowpack without worrying about version mismatches.</p>
<p>Every hook is documented in our new <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/plugins">Plugins Guide</a> for plugin authors. The new API is heavily inspired by <a href="https://rollupjs.org/">Rollup</a>, so we hope it already feels familiar to many of you.</p>
<h2 id="simplified-configuration">Simplified Configuration</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/snowpack-27-screenshot-3.png" alt="snowpack screenshot"></p>
<p>Snowpack v2.0 originally introduced the concept of build <code>"scripts"</code> as a way to configure anything from file building to HTTP request proxying. Scripts were flexible, but hard to document and frustrating to debug.</p>
<p>Our internal plugin rewrite presented an opportunity to improve the developer experience while keeping the flexibility of direct CLI tooling. You can now connect third-party tooling directly into Snowpack’s build pipeline using one of two new utility plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>@snowpack/plugin-build-script</code>: Use any CLI directly to build files for Snowpack.</li>
<li><code>@snowpack/plugin-run-script</code>: Run arbitrary CLI commands during dev/build.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other options like <code>mount</code>, <code>proxy</code>, and <code>alias</code> (see below) are now easier to customize as well with top-level config options that take the guesswork out of common configuration.</p>
<p>The <code>"scripts"</code> configuration format will continue to be supported in Snowpack v2, but we recommend migrating any custom scripts to <code>"plugins"</code> and plan to remove support in a future major release.</p>
<h2 id="new%3A-import-aliasing">New: Import Aliasing</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/snowpack-27-screenshot-2.png" alt="snowpack screenshot"></p>
<p>In previous versions of Snowpack, import aliasing was hard to understand and configure (and it didn’t support all types of aliasing). Starting in Snowpack v2.7, <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#import-aliases">Import Aliases</a> gets a new top-level <code>alias</code> config so that you can define as many custom aliases as you’d like. Package import aliases are also supported.</p>
<h2 id="improved-build-performance">Improved Build Performance</h2>
<p>Snowpack’s official webpack plugin is now more powerful than ever, with new support for multi-page website bundling and better default performance settings (based on the <a href="https://web.dev/granular-chunking-nextjs/">latest research from Google</a>). Special shout out to <a href="https://github.com/mxmul">@mxmul</a> (Yelp) for leading these community contributions!</p>
<p>If you don’t use a bundler in production, you’ll still see a smaller build. That’s because Snowpack v2.7 now ships with minification on by default. We plan to keep improving the default unbundled build performance story over the next few releases, so stay tuned.</p>
<h2 id="svelte-%2B-typescript-support">Svelte + TypeScript Support</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/svelte-ts.png" alt="snowpack screenshot"></p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-and-typescript">Svelte announced official support for TypeScript</a>. We’re huge fans of both projects and couldn’t pass up the chance to test the new support out in a brand new Svelte + TypeScript app template for Snowpack.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="https://github.com/pikapkg/snowpack/tree/master/packages/create-snowpack-app">Create Snowpack App</a> for a list of all of our new app templates.</p>
<h2 id="thank-you%2C-contributors!">Thank You, Contributors!</h2>
<p>Finally, Snowpack wouldn’t be possible without the <a href="https://github.com/pikapkg/snowpack/graphs/contributors">150+ contributors</a> who contributed features, fixes, and documentation improvements. Thanks again for all of your help.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
            
                <article>
                    

                    <div>
                                                    <p>Web development provides opportunities to work on different kinds of projects, learn all sorts of things, and dive deeply into specific areas of interest. It makes for a rewarding career choice. But if I’m being honest, the magic of the refresh button, the code-save-refresh feedback loop of digital creation is what drove my interest in web development when I started back in the mid-2000s.</p>
<p>My first projects—the ones I approached with little more than slapdash curiosity—were essential to solidifying my passion of making web things and leading me to an eventual career doing it.</p>
<p>But they were simple, half-baked ideas. They were side projects. And to this day I believe that the ability to dream up and execute a side project is the single, coolest, and funnest aspect of web dev.</p>
<p>In a way, calling them <em>side</em> projects doesn’t do them justice. I suppose most people would think of a side project as something that is, at most, secondary to your main job. But I don’t think of them as much in those terms. Sure, my job is important to me and I enjoy it and am grateful to have it. That said, in a longer-term view of things, I consider my side projects as equally important. I need to have both my job and my personal projects to feel like I have life balance; to feel fulfilled by my work.</p>
<p>Side projects are important. Unfortunately they are also notorious for going unfinished—whether by lack of time or motivation. I’m not a prolific creator by any means, but I have managed to make a thing or two (despite living with a <a href="https://www.curesma.org/about-sma/">progressive physical impairment</a> that necessitates that I peck out this article one key at a time on an <a href="https://blakewatson.com/journal/writing-and-coding-with-the-macos-accessibility-keyboard/">onscreen keyboard</a>).</p>
<p>I’ll share some tips and tricks I’ve picked up along the way that helped me through the rough patches.</p>
<h2>Small things are OK (and fun!)</h2>
<p>Projects come in all shapes and sizes, and that’s cool. My personal definition of a side project can be something as small as a <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a> or as big as a large website. I enjoy working on small side projects for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can be completed quickly before your motivation runs dry.</li>
<li>A finished project is a success, and a series of small successes can give you the momentum you need to achieve larger ones.</li>
<li>They are good for learning, whether it’s something technical, like a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS trick</a>, or just something that serves as a proof of concept for a bigger idea.</li>
<li>They’re fun!</li>
</ul>
<p>When you’ve got an afternoon and you just want to get something accomplished, a <a href="https://blakewatson.com/space-invaders/">tiny side project</a> can be the perfect outlet.</p>
<h2>Scary things aren’t scary after you face them</h2>
<p>I often experience this phenomenon where there is one particular part of my project that, for whatever reason, I am absolutely terrified of. I will put off doing that part of the project—often going to great lengths of procrastination just to avoid facing it at all. Sometimes it’s enough to halt a project in its tracks. I think it’s related to imposter syndrome. It’s as if this one tricky thing is going to finally prove to myself that I’m not a real developer, that my goal it is too lofty to accomplish.</p>
<p>That thought process is bullshit. Even if the thing in question is difficult, it doesn’t <em>prove</em> anything. Furthermore, it’s been my experience that the thing I’m scared of turns out to be nothing whenever I finally look into it. You can’t escape learning in web dev. Once you accept the fact that you’re going to be doing some searching and some Stack Overflow-ing, you can start to move past the idea that you’re going to hit some insurmountable obstacle.</p>
<h2>The one new thing strategy</h2>
<p>Speaking of scary things, a good way to face them is one at a time. I often start projects where I’m going to use familiar tools and strategies except for <em>one new thing</em> that I want to use or learn. For example, I was scared of learning <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> for a long time. CSS is already hard enough, the thought process went, without adding all these extra rules and setup. But eventually, on some side project, I decided that this would be the project where I would finally use Sass. It was my one new thing for that project.</p>
<p>This little strategy has served me well. It allows for experimentation while building on the solid foundation that is your existing knowledge. I learned jQuery, Sass, Knockout, Vue and a whole lot of other stuff by making them my one new thing on a project.</p>
<p>Beyond a learning tool, it can also help you keep things fresh and exciting. Maybe you always use WordPress, but this time you want to use a fancy <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMstack</a> thing just because. Maybe you always wanted to try a popular library, but never had a reason to move away from the one that you are most familiar with. Well now you have a reason—just to have one new thing.</p>
<h2>Git is not just for source control</h2>
<p>If you are writing code, you should probably be using some sort of source control like Git; you could even make it your one new thing!</p>
<p>But I have found another great use for Git. Well, it’s more of a side effect really. A commit in Git represents a little piece of something you created or fixed. It’s an accomplishment. And the more they accumulate, the better. If you feel your motivation seeping away, take a look at your commit history and remind yourself how far you’ve come. It’s an automatic to-done list.</p>
<p>You should commit as often as it makes sense for your project. In my experience, making small commits with relevant messages helps you stay on track by knowing what you were working on previously, what you are doing now, and giving you that feeling of progress being made.</p>
<h2>Scratching an itch</h2>
<p>A great motivator for a side project is making something for yourself. Completely original ideas are rare, but maybe no one is solving a particular  problem the way <em>you</em> want to. Most of my side projects start with this being the core motivation.</p>
<p>I didn’t like the built-in new tab page in web browsers so I made <a href="https://afinestart.me/">A Fine Start</a>. I didn’t like the dice rolling applications available for the Mac, so I made <a href="https://d20app.me/">d20</a>. I wanted a better way to maintain a digital character sheet for my D&amp;D character, so I made <a href="https://minimalcharactersheet.com/">Minimal Character Sheet</a>. I wanted to listen to and collect the best synthwave mixes on YouTube, so I made <a href="https://synthwave.live/">synthwave.live</a>.</p>
<h2>Don’t rely on memory</h2>
<p>We don’t always control when ideas strike. Even though you are working on the user login feature, your brain might suddenly come up with the perfect animation for the hero section of your homepage. When these situations happen, you need low-friction tools at your disposal to capture your thoughts before they evaporate into the ether.</p>
<p>Whether it’s the issue tracking capabilities of GitHub or the simplicity of a plain text list, you need a way to record an idea and be confident that you (or someone else if you have contributors) are going to tackle said thing in the future.</p>
<p>For me, that mostly involves keeping notes in <a href="https://simplenote.com/">Simplenote</a> and keeping my todo list in <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> or <a href="https://www.taskpaper.com/">Taskpaper</a>. When I truly need low-friction and can’t be bothered to categorize or even give a title to quick note, I use <a href="https://tot.rocks/">Tot</a> as a virtual sticky note. Before Tot, I used macOS’ built-in app, <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/stickies/welcome/mac">Stickies</a>, which is also great for just having a place to write something down.</p>
<p>It doesn’t really matter what tool you use as long as you have one that you <em>will</em> use. We can’t keep everything in our heads—we’re only human.</p>
<h2>Other motivators</h2>
<p>I already covered making something for yourself to “scratch an itch” but there other motivators for side projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making money. Not every side project needs to be a business. But one certainly <em>could</em> be. Even if it’s just a little bit of hobby money, it feels good when people give you cash a thing you created.</li>
<li>Portfolio / resume / self promotion. This is especially helpful if you’re just starting out in web development. No matter what skills you say you have, what education you might have, employers want to see what you can do. Side projects serve well for building out your portfolio when you don’t have as many real-world examples.</li>
<li>Making helpful things. This is related to scratching an itch, but it’s about scratching someone else’s itch. This metaphor is going in a weird direction. All I’m trying to say is that it feels good when people use something you’ve made and it helps them. It’s a pretty darn good motivator.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Time is relative</h2>
<p>You may have deadlines whether they be external or self-imposed; that’s fine. Deadlines can be a good motivator. But in my experience, putting too much pressure on yourself is a good way to snuff out a project before it gets going. What helps me is to remember that as long as progress is being made, that’s a win.</p>
<p>When you start thinking about your project and everything it entails, it can be overwhelming. But if you’ve used your tools to gather your thoughts, and if you have a to-do list of any sort, then try to focus on just a small piece. Go for a small win. Every little bit of progress gets you that much closer. And like we’ve already said, small successes can lead to big ones.</p>
<p>Figure out whatever takes the pressure off and use that. Pace yourself. Slow and steady wins the race.</p>
<h2>Just do it</h2>
<p>These are just a few of the tips and tricks that help me to stay motivated and productive when working on side projects. But even with all of these tools at my disposal, I can procrastinate and binge media with the best of them. And sometimes that’s okay. You don’t always need to be working on something.</p>
<p>But if you feel like you’re stuck or unmotivated, it might be time to rip off the band-aid and just get started already. Sometimes starting is half the battle. Use whatever productivity method (or lack thereof) you prefer and make yourself focus for at least a little bit of time on making progress on your side project. You may stumble upon a motivator, like the ones we discussed, that revives your interest.</p>
<h2>My side projects</h2>
<p>I’ll leave you with a quick note about some of my projects in case you’re interested in checking them out. Most of them can be found on my …</p></div></article></div></div>

Android Market (now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play" target="_blank">Google Play</a>) was introduced two months later, with the same cut: 70/30. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Store" target="_blank">Windows Store</a> was four years late to the party, so Microsoft decided to set bait. Developers started with a 70/30 cut, but then were upgraded to an 80/20 cut after they had reached $25,000 in sales.</p><p>In eight years, Apple experimented with <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-accessories-designs-2015-12?IR=T" target="_blank">dubious design choices</a>, the Microsoft board decided that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc4MzqBFxZE" target="_blank">Ballmer should stop dancing</a>, but app store pricing didn’t change. Yes, Apple <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/6/8/11880730/apple-app-store-subscription-update-phil-schiller-interview" target="_blank">introduced an 85/15 cut</a>, but only for subscriptions, and only after the first year. On the other side, Microsoft <a href="http://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-wants-bigger-cut-revenue-windows-developers" target="_blank">ditched its initial discount in 2015</a> and went with the standard 70/30. Which begs the question:</p><p><i>Is 70/30 some magic ratio or just an arbitrary convention?</i></p><p>Let’s examine that. From a developer’s perspective, the app stores provide the following benefits:</p><ul><li><b>Payment processing</b>. For developers, it eliminates the pain of connecting to credit card systems and merchant accounts. For users, it reduces payment friction, making them buy more.</li><li><b>Hosting</b>. App stores do reliable hosting, even when there is a surge of traffic. No more updating servers, or waking up in the night because of a hacker intrusion or a DDoS attack.</li><li><b>Quality review</b>. Before publishing, apps need to pass an acceptance review. Developers often hate this procedure, but a marketplace without viruses or broken apps makes a user experience better. Satisfied users buy more.</li><li><b>Marketing</b>. It is hard to reach users. App stores promise that if you have a high-quality app, it will go up in the rankings and maybe end up in the featured section.</li><li><b>Platform access</b>. Apple, Google, and Microsoft invested hugely in creating a platform and devices on which you can run your apps. Maybe a part of their 30 percent cut is a fee to access their platforms?</li></ul><p>Reasons to use app stores are quite compelling, and all platforms are moving in that direction.</p><p>But, the value of listed benefits changes significantly with the <i>perceived user value of the app</i>. This dynamic is not intuitive, so let’s use two imaginary developers as an example:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><i>FlappyElephant</i> app is a simple, casual game, made by one developer in his spare time. It costs $1.</td><td></td><td><i>AcmeShop</i> app is a complex editing tool for photographers and illustrators. Made by a team of 200 people, it costs $100.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>These developers’ views on the above app store benefits are quite different:</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="3"><b>Payment processing</b></td></tr><tr><td><i>FlappyElephant</i>: Great, I get charged only 30 cents on the dollar! Other payment collectors charge up to <a href="https://sandbox.plimus.com/pricing.shtml" target="_blank">75 cents per transaction</a>. And there is no way a customer would otherwise take out a credit card for a $1 indie game.</td><td></td><td><i>AcmeShop</i>: $30 per transaction!? Our Stripe-powered webshop costs us $3.2 per transaction (<a href="https://stripe.com/us/pricing" target="_blank">2.9% + 30¢</a>), 9.4x less!</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>Hosting</b></td></tr><tr><td><i>FlappyElephant</i>: After I deploy, I don’t have to worry about it. It can scale and customers will get the update automatically.</td><td></td><td><i>AcmeShop</i>: We already have our own servers; the app store is just one more place where we need to deploy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>Quality review</b></td></tr><tr><td><i>FlappyElephant</i>: Annoying, but at least they let me know it breaks on tablets.</td><td></td><td><i>AcmeShop</i>: Every release is delayed for two days. On iOS, ratings are reseted after every release.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>Marketing</b></td></tr><tr><td><i>FlappyElephant</i>: I can’t believe so many people are finding my small app. Otherwise I would be roasted; AdWords is $1 per click and nobody searches Google for “flappy elephant”.</td><td></td><td><i>AcmeShop</i>: People buy our $100 app because they have known us for 10 years, not because they noticed us while scrolling a list with 50 other apps.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>Platform access</b></td></tr><tr><td><i>FlappyElephant</i>: If there were no smartphones, there would be no <i>FlappyElephant</i>!</td><td></td><td><i>AcmeShop</i>: If there were no tools like ours, creative professionals wouldn’t use the platform!</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Two app developers, two very different stories. While <i>FlappyElephant’</i>s developers would pay even 50 percent, <i>AcmeShop</i>’s developers consider everything above 10 percent to be a ripoff.</p><p>There is a way to satisfy both parties: <i>progressive pricing</i>. The commission should fall as the price of the app increases, which can be implemented in many ways.</p><p>For example, this funky-looking formula:</p><p><i>Commission</i> = 22 / (9 x <i>Price</i> + 90) + 7 / 90</p><p>Has a nice property of commissions for <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=a%2F(1%2Bb)%2Bc%3D0.3,+a%2F(10%2Bb)%2Bc%3D0.2,+a%2F(100%2Bb)%2Bc%3D0.1" target="_blank">$1, $10 and $100 being round numbers</a>:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><b>Price</b></td><td><b>Commission</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>$1</b></td><td><b>30.00%</b></td></tr><tr><td>$2</td><td>28.15%</td></tr><tr><td>$5</td><td>24.07%</td></tr><tr><td><b>$10</b></td><td><b>20.00%</b></td></tr><tr><td>$20</td><td>15.93%</td></tr><tr><td>$50</td><td>11.85%</td></tr><tr><td><b>$100</b></td><td><b>10.00%</b></td></tr><tr><td>$200</td><td>8.94%</td></tr></tbody></table><p><i>Price</i> can be either actual transaction price, or, arguably more fair, <i>cumulative user spend per app</i>. In the case of latter, after user purchases 10 times a $10 monthly subscription, cumulative user spend is $100 and the developer is given a 10% commission. Again, this is just one of progressive pricing options.</p><p>I think that makes perfect sense. I purchase many $1 apps impulsively, thanks to the app stores. But I never purchase anything above $20 without going to the Internet and researching all the alternative options. I buy an expensive app because I trust the developer, and then the app store just makes it more expensive. Not just 30 percent. App stores make it 42 percent more expensive (30/70=42.8%).</p><p>Of course, big developers like <i>AcmeShop</i> are not stupid. They have found a way to have their cake and eat it too. The solution is simple:</p><ol><li>Make your apps free.</li><li>In order to use the app, users need a separate “cloud” account.</li><li>The free account doesn’t offer much.</li><li>The free app unlocks content or features that can be purchased in the “cloud.”</li></ol><p>One by one, big developers have started implementing exactly that strategy.</p><p>For example, the Amazon Kindle iOS app doesn’t allow book purchasing:</p><p><img title="Kindle FAQ, credits: Author" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iPad_Kindle_FAQ_Cropped-1024x542.png" alt="ipad_kindle_faq_cropped" width="584" height="309" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iPad_Kindle_FAQ_Cropped-1024x542.png 1024w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iPad_Kindle_FAQ_Cropped-300x159.png 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iPad_Kindle_FAQ_Cropped-768x407.png 768w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iPad_Kindle_FAQ_Cropped-500x265.png 500w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iPad_Kindle_FAQ_Cropped.png 1617w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px"></p><p>Kindle’s Android app is even more blunt; it circumvents Play Store with a built-in browser (!):</p><p><img title="Android Kindle, credits: Author" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Android_Kindle-169x300.png" alt="android_kindle" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Android_Kindle-169x300.png 169w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Android_Kindle-576x1024.png 576w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Android_Kindle.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px"></p><p>Microsoft Office mobile is free for devices <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2900830/microsoft-office-will-be-free-for-screens-under-10-inches.html" target="_blank">smaller than 10.1 inches</a>, but larger devices need a separate <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/business/compare-more-office-365-for-business-plans" target="_blank">Office 365 subscription</a>:</p><p><img title="Collaborate using microsoft word for ipad, credits: https://www.vioreliftode.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Collaborate_Using_Microsoft_Word_For_iPad_app_18.png" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Collaborate_Using_Microsoft_Word_For_iPad_app_18-1024x430.png" alt="collaborate_using_microsoft_word_for_ipad_app_18" width="584" height="245" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Collaborate_Using_Microsoft_Word_For_iPad_app_18-1024x430.png 1024w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Collaborate_Using_Microsoft_Word_For_iPad_app_18-300x126.png 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Collaborate_Using_Microsoft_Word_For_iPad_app_18-768x323.png 768w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Collaborate_Using_Microsoft_Word_For_iPad_app_18-500x210.png 500w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Collaborate_Using_Microsoft_Word_For_iPad_app_18.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px"></p><p>Spotify has a slightly different system. It offers in-app purchases, but they are more expensive than purchasing a subscription on their website. Spotify even sends an email to users warning that they made a stupid decision:</p><p><img title="Spotify Premium, credits: https://scdn.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Attachment-1.0.jpg" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Spotify-Premium.jpg" alt="spotify-premium" width="648" height="574" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Spotify-Premium.jpg 648w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Spotify-Premium-300x266.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Spotify-Premium-339x300.jpg 339w" sizes="(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px"></p><p>Practically every music subscription service has been <a href="https://musicmachinery.com/2011/08/04/how-are-music-services-responding-to-apples-new-tos/" target="_blank">circumventing app store payments since 2011</a>.</p><p>So, congratulations, dear app store product manager. You just shot yourself in the foot. You were greedy for 30 percent and now you are getting zero percent. And users of your app store are annoyed that purchasing something requires switching to a browser. But what can you do? If you kick Kindle, Office, and Spotify off your app store, then nobody will care about your platform. So maybe big developers are right—maybe you should pay them to publish great software on your store? Like when Microsoft was paying selected developers <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-pays-big-bucks-for-windows-phone-8-apps-2013-6?IR=T" target="_blank">up to $100,000 to port their apps to Windows Phone</a>.</p><p>Mobile app stores have a problem with big developers avoiding payment systems, but desktop app stores have an even bigger problem: they are avoided altogether.</p><p>This year, the co-founder of Epic Games wrote a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/04/microsoft-monopolise-pc-games-development-epic-games-gears-of-war" target="_blank">long rant about UWP and Windows 10 Store</a>, asking for Microsoft’s guarantee (among other things) that:</p><p><i>“…users, developers, and publishers will always be free to engage in direct commerce with </i><i>each other, without Microsoft forcing everyone into its formative in-app commerce monopoly </i><i>and taking a 30% cut.”</i></p><p>But the Windows 10 Store is good compared to the Mac App Store, which is a joke. It is only useful for downloading Apple apps—in which case Apple pays a commission to itself. Even top-grossing featured apps <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/developers-keep-leaving-mac-app-store/" target="_blank">are leaving</a>, and switching to manual installation. Compare that experience to that of a mobile app store install:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><b>MacOS manual install</b></td><td></td><td><b>iOS</b></td></tr><tr><td><ol><li>Google for a developer webpage.</li><li>Find and download a Mac version.</li><li>Mount the downloaded DMG (double-click).</li><li>Open the mounted drive. It contains two files: an app and a shortcut to the application folder.</li><li>If you clicked the app, you just made a mistake! That is just going to run the app from the mounted drive.</li><li>Instead, <a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Install_Drag_Drop.png" target="_blank">drag and drop the app</a> to the application folder (there is usually an arrow so you don’t get confused about what to drag where).</li><li>Eject the mounted drive (using the right-click menu).</li><li>Delete the DMG.</li><li>When starting the app for the first time, authorize it using a <a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Security-dialog.png" target="_blank">security dialog</a>.</li></ol></td><td></td><td><ol><li>Find an app in the app store.</li><li>Tap the “Get” button.</li></ol></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Mounting drives? Dragging and dropping to a system folder? What is this, an 80s Mac with a floppy drive?!</p><p>And, in case a Mac app doesn’t have an automatic updater, for every upgrade you have to <i>repeat the exact same procedure.</i></p><p>On Windows, manual installation is a few steps simpler, and you often get a nice malware as a reward for your effort. Like the PCs of my extended family. One of them has so much malware it would be the envy of the Kaspersky Lab researchers.</p><p>Why are Mac and Windows still in the Stone Age of app distribution?</p><p>Back to the original question. I argue that a 70/30 cut is an arbitrary ratio trying to be one-size-fits-all. It fails at that because the value proposition is completely different for developers of low-price versus high-price products. And app stores fail to profit on high-price apps, because that high price is listed somewhere else.</p><p>So, we are now in a triple loss-loss-loss situation:</p><ul><li><i>Users</i> have a bad experience because purchasing or installing an app is convoluted.</li><li><i>Developers</i> have to create workarounds that create user friction.</li><li><i>App store owners</i> make zero money on high-price products.</li></ul><p>And it is all because of tech politics.</p><p>I will end with that conclusion, as I need to go and mount/unmount some drives.</p><p>UPDATE: Check the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5fj2y9/why_app_stores_need_progressive_pricing/">discussion on Reddit</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

They seem worldly and wise. Also, whatever is happening in their lives, theyâ€™re never completely on their own â€“ they always have their books. My mother is one of these life-long devourers of literature, for whom books are a constant companion. She recalls contracting tuberculosis as an eight-year-old girl, before there was a vaccine, and being sent to spend six months at a convalescent home in Margate, more than 100 miles from her family. â€˜Books saved me from what would have been unbearable, allowing me to escape from that bed to have adventures in other places and other lives,â€™ she says.</p><p>Avid readers often look back on their book-reading with fondness. â€˜My first memories of reading are of my late mum taking me to our local library, and both of us taking out as many books as we could carry,â€™ says Clare Reynolds, author of the Years of Reading Selfishly <a href="https://yearsofreadingselfishly.blog/" target="_blank">blog</a>. â€˜We didnâ€™t have a car so had to make sure we could manage them all on the bus.â€™</p><p>Reynoldsâ€™s passion for reading continued through adolescence and led her to study English literature at the University of Leeds, but then the demands of work and family caught up with her, and for years she found herself in what she calls the â€˜reading wildernessâ€™. Anecdotally, many of us recognise this overwhelming sense of competing demands on our time. We hanker for the space to read more. We buy the books, they pile up, but we never get round to reading them â€“ the Japanese even have a term for it, <em>tsundoku</em>.</p><p>Data back this up: a US <a href="https://blog.scribd.com/home/the-benefits-of-reading" target="_blank">survey</a> found that more than one-third of adults report a desire to read more books, with book reading second only to exercise as the most wished-for activity. Similarly, in France, 65 per cent of people aged 15 years and over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/416780/wish-to-read-more-books-france/" target="_blank">said</a> they wished they read more books, rising to 77 per cent among those already reading at average levels.</p><p>If youâ€™re one of these people, opening a book might have become something to do when you havenâ€™t got anything else going on, which is almost never. Itâ€™s as if you decided at some point, likely without conscious thought, that even though you love books, book reading is effectively the least important thing in your life â€“ youâ€™ll squeeze it in, if you can. And if you are clinging to the remnants of a book reading habit, Iâ€™ll bet you save it for the end of the day, or perhaps only for when youâ€™re on holiday.</p><p>To read more books, you need to make it a higher priority, which means changing your daily habits and routines to accommodate more reading. People who are â€˜super readersâ€™ by virtue of their profession â€“ such as literary editors, agents and book award judges â€“ show us just how much reading is possible if you are willing and able to give it a high enough priority. Consider Ed Needham, former editor at magazines such as <em>FHM</em> and <em>Rolling Stone</em>, who in 2018 launched his own magazine, <em>Strong Words</em>, which features more than 100 book reviews every month. Needham reads or listens to every one of the reviewed books. â€˜I just have to find the time, thereâ€™s no way around it,â€™ he says. â€˜I produce an issue of <em>Strong Words</em> every six weeks, and we worked out that for five of those six weeks I read the equivalent of <em>War and Peace</em> every week.â€™</p><p>When reading books is your livelihood or essential to fulfil your responsibilities, then it becomes the priority around which the rest of life must bend. You donâ€™t need to go as far as Needham, of course, but to read more books you do need to take a hard look at whether, given the value you place on books, you are providing the activity with the attention and time it deserves in your life.</p><p>â€˜Sometimes, you just need the slightest encouragement to displace something that isnâ€™t earning its keep in your routine,â€™ says Needham. â€˜I remember [the US filmmaker and writer] John Waters saying he found it really easy to read every night because he never watched television. That made me realise it is really easy to stop watching television, because I get more from books than I do from the vast majority of television programmes.â€™</p><p>When there are so many options competing for our time, itâ€™s worth reminding yourself of the unique rewards of book reading. I read the newspaper every morning and my day job involves reading countless essays and articles, but when I manage to find the time to immerse myself in a quality nonfiction book, itâ€™s a wholly different experience â€“ you can almost feel the presence of the author alongside you on a personal intellectual journey. By the end, youâ€™re somehow changed, you see the world differently. And although TV and video games of course offer escapism, thereâ€™s nothing quite like devouring the pages of a beautiful novel, sitting quietly in one place while letting words transport you to another. Screens show you whatâ€™s happening; novels, by contrast, construct those fictions within your mind, allowing you to become anyone, and go anywhere.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p>It will take significant effort for you to read more books, at least at first. To succeed long-term, you need to develop new reading habits, so that reading is something you do without resorting to conscious effort and willpower. But before getting into details of how to do this, there are some preliminary steps to ease the way.</p><p>The first is to reflect on <em>why</em> you want to read more books. Benjamin Gardner is a social psychologist at Kingâ€™s College, London and an expert on the psychology of habits. His theory of habit formation begins with the need for sufficient motivation. â€˜Think about why is it exactly you want to do it? What would the benefits be? Answering these kinds of questions can make you more motivated,â€™ he says.</p><p>Thereâ€™s little doubt that you will benefit from reading more books. People who read literary fiction in particular tend to be better at reading othersâ€™ <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0233378" target="_blank">emotions</a> and have greater <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2020-15352-001.html" target="_blank">moral sensitivity</a>, possibly due to their <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-21762-4_13" target="_blank">simulation</a> of the lives of complex characters; and reading nonfiction will increase your knowledge and broaden your mind. In fact, reading books is considered a cognitive â€˜<a href="https://www.oatext.com/Cognitive-reserve-the-evolution-of-the-conceptual-framework.php#gsc.tab=0" target="_blank">reserve building</a>â€™ activity that could help to protect you from Alzheimerâ€™s and related illnesses. However, also relevant here is the distinction between intrinsic motivation, which means you find reward in doing something for its own sake, and extrinsic motivation, which is when you’re motivated by the promise of some kind of external pay-off. Note that, especially when starting out, you are more likely to prevail if you choose books to read that are inherently enjoyable for you, be that because you find them entertaining, calming, moving or intellectually stimulating and fascinating. This might require some trial and error until you find a genre and/or author that matches your tastes and priorities.</p><p>James Clear, the author of <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/111/1112146/atomic-habits/9781847941831.html" target="_blank"><em>Atomic Habits</em></a> (2018), agrees. He recalls the approach of the Indian-American entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant:</p><blockquote>[Ravikant] says something along the lines of â€˜Read whatever the hell you want to read in the beginningâ€™ because the real thing that youâ€™re focused on is building the habit of reading, not necessarily the knowledge. Like if you just want to read romance novels. Awesome. Read that. If you just want to read fantasy, read that. Read whatever helps you fall in love with the act of being a reader or the habit of reading. And once you fall in love with the habit, then itâ€™s easy â€¦ Now youâ€™ve got a lot of options because itâ€™s part of your life.</blockquote><p>A related point is giving yourself permission to quit books that youâ€™re not enjoying. â€˜I had spent so many years picking up books that people had told me I â€œshouldâ€� read,â€™ says Reynolds. â€˜I diligently ploughed my way through literature prize longlists and shortlists. I would try to push on until the end of every one, even when I really didnâ€™t enjoy them. Then one day, I just put a book down I didnâ€™t love, and picked up another one which I did. It was then the idea for my Reading Selfishly blog and ethos was born.â€™</p><p>â€˜A lot of people feel locked in from the start,â€™ adds Clear. â€˜But the little phrase I try to keep in mind is <em>start more books, quit most of them, read the great ones twice</em>. I think that a lot of readers would be well-served if they did that.â€™</p><p>A next preliminary step is to look at your surroundings. How easy is it for you to grab a book â€“ paper or digital â€“ and start reading? â€˜The more frictionless [a habit] is, the easier it is to pick it up,â€™ says Clear. He recommends making changes to your digital and physical environments so that reading is easy and effortless â€“ including making reading apps especially prominent on your phone, and placing books in the physical places that you most often frequent. â€˜Being around books makes it very easy to pick them up and check them out. If you want something to be a big part of your life, make it a big part of your environment.â€™ Of course, if you are prone to <em>tsundoku</em>, this is a lifestyle tip that you have already mastered â€“ just try to remember to actually pick up those books.</p><p>A final preliminary step is to consider your goals. Clear recommends having modest goals for your new reading habit initially. If you try to achieve too much, too quickly, youâ€™re more likely to fail. â€˜I would say giving yourself the permission to just read one page per day or something like that,â€™ he says. Clear calls this â€˜the two-minute ruleâ€™. By getting into the routine of just â€˜showing upâ€™, even for just 120 seconds, the new activity is more likely to become an entrenched part of your daily routine. â€˜There is a deep truth about habits in general that people overlook,â€™ Clear says, â€˜which is a habit must be established before it can be improved<em>.</em>â€™</p><p>Now, having laid the foundations for your new reading habit, then according to Gardnerâ€™s model, the next stage involves creating new â€˜action associationsâ€™, which in the context of books means …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

July 30, 2020 | https://shihn.ca/posts/2020/media-pool/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://shihn.ca/posts/2020/media-pool/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="articleBody">
  
<p>No one likes it when you go to a web page and it automatically starts playing a video loudly. Browsers have changed their auto-play policies to let JavaScript auto-play a video only if it's inline and muted. (See posts for <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/6784/new-video-policies-for-ios/">Safari</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes">Chrome</a>).</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="Meme saying: One does not simply autoplay videos, and I will find you and I will pause you" loading="lazy" width="700" height="349" src="https://shihn.ca/stuff/posts/media-pool/meme.jpg">
</figure>
<h2>Problem: Playing a video queue</h2>
<p>This change in policy is great, but it may restrict some use cases. Say, you have created a queue of videos (or audios). You'd want the next one to play as soon as the first one finishes. Instagram/Snapchat like stories is a good example for this.</p>
<p>Normally one would implement this by listening to your video's progress and as soon as it ends, call <code>play</code> on the next video. But, if the video is not muted, it will not play according to the browser's media policy.</p>
<p>Unmuted videos can be played if they were triggered by a user action. But, when playing one video after another, asking the user to tap to play again doesn't feel like a great user experience.</p>
<h2>Reusing the media element</h2>
<p>Once a media element (<code>&lt;video&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>) has been triggered by a user action, it gets <strong>cleared</strong> by the browser for future use. i.e. Later on, some script can play the video unmuted.</p>
<p>With that in mind, the very basic solution is to create a single media element, and re-use it for every video. This, however, may not be a great user experience. Loading the next video may take time, so transitioning from one video to another will not be a smooth one.</p>
<h2>Media Pool</h2>
<p>In an ideal world where resources and browser limitations do not exist, one could load every video in memory. But it's not good practice, and some browsers (like iOS Safari) limit the number of media elements in memory.</p>
<p>So we create a <strong>Media Pool</strong>. This is similar to <em>thread pools</em> in multi-threaded languages where you allocate a thread to a task and when the task is done, the thread is released to be used by another task.</p>
<p>Applying this model to media elements, we can keep a few videos in memory for a smooth experience, and release them back to the pool when they are done playing. As new videos get queued up to play, they request a media element from the pool. The pool will provide an unused or a recycled media element.</p>
<p>In the following diagram, we have a pool of seven media elements <span>♦</span>. We keep the last video in memory, and preload the next one. So there are only 3 allocated media elements at a time. As the videos leave this three-video-window, the media element is released back into the pool.</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="Diagram showing 3 allocated media elements in a media pool" loading="lazy" width="800" height="383" src="https://shihn.ca/stuff/posts/media-pool/pool1.png">
</figure>
<p>When video-3 finishes, video-4 starts playing. video-2 is outside the window so it releases the media element back into the queue. video5 gets a new element allocated from the queue.</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="Diagram showing 3 allocated media elements in a media pool" loading="lazy" width="800" height="384" src="https://shihn.ca/stuff/posts/media-pool/pool2.png">
</figure>
<h2>Blessing the Media</h2>
<p>A media pool sounds like a great way to reuse video elements but we have not addressed the original problem - playing unmuted videos automatically. I discovered that Google's AMP project had the <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-story/1.0/media-pool.md">same problem</a> as this, and they use a term called <em><strong>blessing</strong></em> a video element.</p>
<p>When the user takes their first action to unmute a video or to start an unmuted video; in the same event handler, the media-pool will <em>unmute</em> all the videos in the pool (allocated, unallocated, and released ones). It will then mute the ones that are not active right away. By doing this, all videos have been <strong>cleared</strong> by the browser. If we use AMP's terminology, these videos have now been <em><strong>blessed</strong></em>.</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="How to bless a video" loading="lazy" width="800" height="233" src="https://shihn.ca/stuff/posts/media-pool/pool3.png">
</figure>
<p>As one video finishes, the script can now call <code>play</code> on a blessed video element to start playing it even when it's unmuted.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things to keep in mind when implementing a <em>blessing</em> based media pool. Firstly, one cannot invoke operations like <code>mute</code>, <code>unmute</code>, <code>play</code> on a media element if it doesn't have any media loaded. That's why the unallocated media-elements should be loaded with an empty video file. Secondly, in some browsers operations of media elements can be interrupted when invoked in a certain way, for example calling <code>load</code> after calling <code>play</code> can reject the <code>play</code> promise. The AMP project creates a queue of operations per media element. I decided to do the same in my case.</p>
<h2>Media Pool implementation</h2>
<p>I have created a small framework independent <a href="https://github.com/pshihn/media-pool">media-pool implementation</a> that you can use if you like, or feel free to look at the code to create a new one. AMP's version of media pool is <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-story/1.0/media-pool.js">available here</a> but it may be a bit AMP specific.</p>
<p>I have further optimized my <a href="https://github.com/pshihn/media-pool">media-pool implementation</a> so it lazy-releases a media-element; which means if the video is active again it can reuse its old media-element even though it was released. This prevents re-attaching to DOM and re-loading videos. In the case where the released media-element has been allocated to some other video player, the video player will get a new one from the pool.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>This post is personal one. It is a painful one. I adapted the reflections that I sent to Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke, and Peter Rosseau recently. I have largely redacted names, except for public interactions or my own correspondences.</p>
<p>Everyone who is privileged enough to hold a PhD in economics should reflect on our toxic culture. Before you start, read the American Economics Association (AEA)&nbsp; <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/code-of-conduct">code of professional conduct</a> and <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/aea-policy-harassment-discrimination">policy on harassment and discrimination</a>.</p>
<p>Students please understand that I and many others are working to make your journey better than ours. Economics is hard enough without others who demean you. I love the energy of youth; however, you need allies. We all do.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I am healthy now, due to my hard work in managing my bipolar disorder and the loved ones who carry me when I struggle.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Burn it down: economics failed us.</em></strong></h2>
<p>Economics is a disgrace. The lack of diversity and inclusion degrades our knowledge and policy advice. We hurt economists from undergraduate classrooms to offices at the White House. We drive away talent; we mistreat those who stay; and we tolerate bad behavior.</p>
<p>Some experiences I share may seem innocuous. Taken together, they demonstrate a systemic problem. One economists refuse to tackle. We blame bad behavior on victims. I was blamed. We tell them to toughen up. I was and did. We say the harasser is good economist and imply the victim is not. He was supposedly better than me. He is not.</p>
<p>I chose to name the senior men economists [many redacted here], who hurt me and others. They are well-respected. You know them. By doing nothing, you allow them to hurt people. You allow them to teach bad behavior to the next generation. I did too. I blame myself and did not speak up. I am sorry, and that is why I am sharing now. I am not filing a complaint. I am sharing. After more than a decade as a macroeconomist, I am fine. You know me. It is painful to share a part of me you did not know. It is painful to revisit. I do not name names to tar and feather. I do it to make our problem concrete.</p>
<p>I mentor many people. They come to me as an ally, as someone who will listen. I do. Some conversations are happy, people looking for advice on how to be an economist. Some conversations are sad, people dealing with painful experiences in economics. Some get better. Some do not. Last year a Black woman undergrad asked me how to get from her satellite-school state university to a PhD program in economics. We talked and I gave her advice. I emailed her a few months later to see what she had decided.&nbsp; Her brother replied that his sister had killed herself. She will not be an economist. Other became economists then we drove them away. The tenure of a Native American woman economist was revoked after her men colleagues turned on her. I talk with her regularly. We talk about how she could return to academia after she is healthy again. Do you know how many Native American women are economist? Very few. Do you know how many Black economists work at the Fed? One out of 406. Economics is a disgrace.</p>
<p>The indignities are astounding. The new woman economist at the Board who was asked by the men colleagues at lunch if she “satisfied” her husband. Her husband is an economist I know well. An officer sabotaged her work . She moved to another group. He stayed. I have talked with the woman and her husband several times. Broke my heart. Her tormentor is good friends with mine. I thought it was me. It was not me. It was them and they have not stopped. I told her she would get better. I did. No one told me that in 2011 when I broke. I was told that I was not the first woman he targeted. WTF? No one told me I could report him. WTF?? Both tormentors are senior officers at the Board, instrumental to monetary policy decisions. Neither said they were sorry.</p>
<p>Or how about the Southeast Asian research assistant, who I met once? He called me hyperventilating as he told about his abusive work environment. After I hung up, I closed my door and sat in my office sobbing. Economists messed him up. I coached him on how to leave his job and find a new one. He did.</p>
<p>Finally, the woman economics major at Chicago, who went to office hours. She sat on the floor since the room was crowded. Her professor offered her a chair. She said she was fine sitting on the floor. He looked at her and said, “I see you like it on your knees; women do.” Oh yes, and he had had to apologize for telling a sexually explicit ‘joke’ in public. He continues to teach undergraduates.[If I ever cross paths with this old nasty man, I will beat the shit out of him.] Economics breaks people and it is broken. I am angry. You should be too.</p>
<p>I mainly share my experiences here. I am NOT special. Many have similar experiences, in some cases worse. I have written documents to back these incidents up. It is awful to have these records in my email inbox, my Twitter, my text messages. Do not tell me, good men are economists too. I do not care. You did not protect the victims. You did not protect me. You had to know something was wrong, and you did nothing. I spend considerable time picking up the pieces of people we break. It is not fair. It is wrong what we do.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Economics destroys its students</em></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>We discourage undergraduates, women and men from studying economics. The <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/resources/member-docs/final-climate-survey-results-sept-2019">AEA’s first climate survey</a> of economics clearly shows our toxic profession, especially among under-represented groups. The AEA should commission surveys of undergraduates, research assistants, pre- and postdoctoral students. Harassment begins in undergraduate classrooms and often does not stop unless you leave economics.</li>
<li>We do not nurture the next generation. Many graduate students and economists have mental health issues. <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/4/26/econ-grads-peer-support-network/">Research at Harvard</a> found notably higher rates of depression and anxiety among economics PhD students than other PhD students and the general population. Departments often do send students to campus health resources. The faculty place unrealistic expectations on the students. They are aggressive in private and in public settings. They do not mentor, even when they agree to be their advisors. Faculty suffer too. [Krueger, Weitzman, Sandholm, Farhi, rest in peace. I am so sorry.]</li>
<li>Last year, I reviewed several&nbsp;macro job market papers.&nbsp; I read their abstracts, introductions, and tables/charts. I reviewed students from MIT to India to Stockholm to Santa Barbara and everywhere in between. &nbsp;All their papers were technically impressive and they also benefited from better communication. I tried to help. It was advice not an order. They worked hard on every aspect of their research. [I apologize that my original phrasing was not appropriate. It was an honor to be a part of their journey.]&nbsp; They thanked and many said it added to the support from their professors. Some replies suggested that we could do more for our students, such as::
<ul>
<li>You are the first person who has read any part of my job market paper.</li>
<li>I finally understand my paper.</li>
<li>Our department does not teach us how to write.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Let me be clear, many advisors including the students&nbsp; (part and not part of my review) have support in their departments. Unfortunately some departments do teach writing. Many do. I got encouragement at Michigan. Some did not. I know too many graduates student that economists hurts. We must do better. Absolutely must. I will do better too.</li>
<li>After I saw some common issues, I wrote a <a href="http://macromomblog.com/2019/09/29/we-need-to-talk-more/">blog post on writing</a> for all job market candidates. It is my most read post by far. I was surprised. My advisor, Matthew Shapiro, taught me how to write research papers. Many advisors do not. Some do. I <a href="http://macromomblog.com/2019/12/15/joy-to-the-macro-world/">blogged each of the students revised papers</a>. I cheered &nbsp;them on during the job market. Once a woman candidate thanked me. My email came after an exhausting flyout in the middle of an exhausting week of flyouts. None of these students were my responsibility. I was a section chief, managing five economists, two early career, and three research assistants. We can all do more.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong><em>Predators target research assistants, graduate students, and early-career economists</em></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Research assistants and pre-doctoral fellows are particularly vulnerable. Many are considering a career in economics; however, they do know the culture of economics. They have not chosen to navigate our aggressive norms. The explosion of pre-doctoral programs is a looming disaster. Basically, no economists who supervise these young adults have formal management training. The Board now sends every group manager and section chief to a months-long training. Training does not avoid all bad behavior. No training is much worse.</li>
<li>The Board is now recruiting research assistants from under-represented minorities. Even so, Black and Latinx research assistants vastly outnumber the economists of color. Research assistants have the least power at work. They often have bad experiences. One afternoon, a Black woman research assistant at the Board delivered forecast memos to a White officer. The officer thanked her, &nbsp;using the name of another Black woman research assistant. She corrected her. Six weeks later the officer made the same mistake. The research assistant gave up and asked one of the White research assistants to deliver memos to that officer.</li>
<li>Two research assistants, a Black Latinx woman and a Latinx man, designed the first Research Assistant Survey at the Board. I saw the first drafts, as someone who designs surveys. I could see from the start that the results would be uncomfortable. The discomfort of economists should not outweigh, but often does, the discomfort they cause. One striking finding: research assistants were reluctant to offer critical feedback because they were worried that as a result, they would not get a good recommendation for graduate school. Power dynamics are real and early career scholars do not have power. I was in the meeting where they presented the results to the officers and section chiefs. Not surprisingly, the men in the room tried to explain the uncomfortable findings away. It …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>If you want to free yourself from the past so you can fully move forward into the future, discuss your fears and insecurities with the world.</p>



<p>Or at least with a friend.</p>



<p>Growing comfortable expressing yourself with vulnerability, with full authenticity, will open an entire world of possibility that you never thought imaginable.</p>



<p>The idea is that when you express the fears and insecurities you have held onto for so long, it almost acts as a release valve in your mind. No longer will you have pent up pain, anger, or frustration. No longer will you feel trapped in certain aspects of your life. No longer will you be fearful of being a fully authentic version of yourself. Like an accident on the highway, you have to clean up the roadways in your mind before the traffic of your thoughts can resume moving smoothly.</p>



<p>What I’m going to tell you today is the greatest piece of truth you will ever need to hear. I know this for a fact, because it has helped me in recent weeks clear my own mental traffic jam. While I have no doubt the thoughts in this post will set you free, if acted upon, it will also serve as a catalyst for you to help set others free as well.</p>







<h3><strong>Where is the danger?</strong></h3>



<p>For 29 years, I have kept hidden from the world a very painful, very <em>real</em> part of my life. In recent weeks, I’ve spent a lot of time in the deep end of the vulnerability pool, breaking down the walls in my own mind about the “dangers” of publishing an essay on this most profound aspect of my life.</p>



<p>Only recently have I begun to discuss it outwardly with people besides my family. It’s something I’ve held so close to the vest for so long that I haven’t talked about it even with my closest friends. But <em>why is that</em>? What is it in my mind that has kept me quiet for so long? Is it fear? Is it pride? Is it some sort of perceived danger?</p>



<p>To illustrate how difficult it has been to get three decades of pent up feelings into one essay, I’ll tell you a little about my writing process. Normally when writing an essay, I can pump out 2,000 words in just a few hours. The thoughts come to me like a surging river. But for my upcoming essay, the vulnerability and deep personal aspects of the topic made it excruciatingly difficult to put words into coherent sentences. Thoughts came to be with the scarcity of searching for water in a dried-up riverbed.</p>



<p>After almost three weeks, patching together maybe 200 words per day, I finally have a piece of writing ready to publish this coming Saturday. But the experience made me think a lot about the subtle, unconscious forces at play when addressing such an ingrained pain point. These forces can be a result of our minds perceiving danger, whether real or not, and can reveal themselves in difficulty communicating, difficulty expressing emotions, and could even lead to serious cognitive consequences if not dealt with appropriately.</p>



<p>For me, I believe that sitting down to directly address this pain point, day after day, has required me to focus on two primary factors that could be slowing me down, and hampering me in other areas of my life: lack of self-compassion, and my irrational fear of vulnerability.</p>



<h3><strong>Self-Compassion</strong></h3>



<p>When I interact with people, I typically treat them with respect and do my best to understand them in a deeper way. I give them the benefit of the doubt. If they’re having a hard time with an aspect of their life, I try my best to help them up. If they are feeling down about what they are doing, how they look or how they come across to others, I do my best to encourage them. <em>So why don’t I act with the same sympathy and compassion towards myself?</em></p>



<p>While watching a recent video of myself discussing the difficulties of self-expression on personal matters, I had a realization. Not a realization regarding my confrontation with fear. Not a realization regarding anything I am doing, writing, or building. But a realization so sharp, so piercing, so powerful, and so simple: “I need to give myself a break.”</p>



<p>What I mean is that I need to stop being so hard on myself. I need to have more compassion for myself. When I watch myself on video, I tend to think “my voice sounds weird,” or “I look strange.” I would never say that to someone else, so why do I say it to myself?! At every turn, it has become a habit to talk down to myself, talk myself out of things, and tell myself I’m not good enough. Where I see ugliness in myself, others see beauty. When I see imperfection in what I’m doing, others see perfection in my efforts. Where I see negativity in my mind, others see positivity.</p>



<p>In recent weeks, I’ve taken a step back. As an observer of myself, I have begun to understand that most often, I am the one limiting myself. I am the one not giving myself a chance. And it’s only when I can push through with self-compassion and self-belief that I can make an impact in this world.</p>



<p>By “giving myself a break,” I will allow myself freedom of expression with no limits. It is certainly not an overnight process, but limiting negative self-talk has allowed me the freedom to simply <em>take action</em>.</p>



<h3><strong>Offsetting fear</strong></h3>



<p>When you hold something in from the world for almost three decades, there is an accumulation of things that only serve to constrain the way your mind works. These unconscious mental blocks, these fears, and these insecurities build up and calcify in your mind, clogging up its natural flow.</p>



<p>What results are deep, subconscious insecurities and fears that the conscious brain isn’t always able to control. Left unchecked, your unconscious brain begins irrationally making up stories as to why you cannot or should not do something. And without challenging those stories, you begin to believe them, leading to inaction.</p>



<p>Our brains are evolved from those of our ancient ancestors, who were always on the lookout for tigers and lions waiting to eat them. We have grown acutely aware of possible danger in every area of our lives. On one hand this has allowed us to survive and thrive on earth. On the other hand, because we no longer live in such an environment, our brains still operate in survival mode even if it is only putting words on paper or hitting “publish” when it’s time to share them with the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address this problem, I’ve been exploring the method of “fear-setting.” This is a simple, 20-minute process that, once done, can show you that the danger you perceive in writing vulnerably or in public speaking isn’t actually going to kill you like a tiger in the Savanna.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of believing everything you think, apply the following questions when facing doubt or a fear-inducing situation:</p>



<ul><li>What’s the worst that can happen? What’s so bad about that?<ul><li>So what?…So what?…So what?</li><li>What does that mean about you?</li><li>What’s so bad about that?</li><li>So what?…So what?…So what?</li></ul></li><li>How can you stop those things from happening?</li><li>If the worst happens, how do you repair it?</li><li>What’s the cost of inaction?</li><li>What are the benefits of action?</li><li>Is there proof from your past that you can, in fact, take the above steps?</li></ul>



<p>Confronting the irrational fear of vulnerability in such a direct way is like unclogging a toilet after many years. Forgive my language, but the moment you decide to confront your fears, all that <em>shit</em> built up in your mind will eventually clear.</p>



<h3><strong>Setting myself free</strong></h3>



<p>While this may have seemed like just a stream-of-consciousness rumination on my own difficulties with vulnerability, I want this to serve as an example of how you can approach your own irrational fears of vulnerability.</p>



<p>Realize that telling your story–your unique perspective, is something people <em>want</em> you to do. They want to hear an honest, authentic version of you—not the perpetuation of a façade. When people see your scars and your scrapes and your imperfections, they instantly resonate with you. In putting your truth out there, others become comfortable in being open with theirs.</p>



<p>So when I hit publish on Saturday morning, telling my story to the world, it will be the most significant, most meaningful milestone—more than anything I’ve done or accomplished in my entire life. I say that because it will have set me free from my heaviest mental burden, in a way that no achievement or bullet-point on a resume could.</p>



<p>I will be free to be the most complete version of myself. Because if I can destroy the walls of the self-imposed box I’ve been living in for 29 years, if I can somehow become comfortable and open with the deepest pain in my life, then there is nothing in this world that will stop me from achieving what I’ve been put on this earth to do.</p>



<p>In the perceived “danger” of expressing your innermost feelings and insecurities, realize that it is actually immense power.</p>



<p>In vulnerability there is fear, undoubtedly.</p>



<p>But in expressing that vulnerability, there is magnificent freedom.</p>



<p>If you want to free yourself from the past so you can fully move forward into the future, discuss your fears and insecurities with the world.</p>



<p>Or at least with a friend.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GPT-3 is an amazing technology. Within a few weeks after beta API access opened, a <a href="https://twitter.com/xuenay/status/1283312640199196673" target="_blank">host of jaw-dropping demos</a> popped up, from <a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457" target="_blank">automatic code generation</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1283326066338062337" target="_blank">automated therapy bots</a> to <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3" target="_blank">writing original poetry and Navy SEAL copypasta memes</a>. It does things that would have been science fiction 10 years ago.&nbsp;GPT-3 and its successor algorithms are going to change entire industries.</p><p>Naturally, tech founders and VC investors are salivating at the possibilities of turning GPT-3 applications into businesses.</p><p>But a good technology doesn’t necessarily make for a good business. <strong>The fact that GPT-3 works so well out of the box should be terrifying to founders.</strong> Here’s why:</p><ul><li>If it’s easy to make a good-enough app out of the box, the barriers to entry are mercilessly low. Dozens of competitors for your idea will spring up literally overnight, as they already have in these Twitter demos.</li><li>It’s not just about new entrants. If GPT-3 is so easy to adopt and build products with, incumbents will do it too. Thus, in Clayton Christensen’s framework, GPT-3 looks more like a <strong>sustaining innovation</strong> than a disruptive innovation. This will strengthen existing winners more than it creates openings for new startups.</li><li>If the baseline GPT-3 performance cannot be substantially improved to create a substantial (10x) proprietary edge, the competition will shift away from technology to other dimensions of competition—particularly in marketing and distribution. This is where incumbents beat startups.</li><li>Meanwhile, the profits will accrue to the true beneficiaries: 1) the algorithm owners,&nbsp; OpenAI (and, by extension, Azure), 2) to marketing platforms, particularly Google and Facebook. Both can raise pricing to the point where companies built on each are barely profitable.</li></ul><p>Let’s dive more into these ideas.</p><h2><span id="Low_Barrier_to_Entry_Fierce_Competition"><strong>Low Barrier to Entry = Fierce Competition</strong></span></h2><div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.allencheng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png?w=750&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.allencheng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png?w=471&amp;ssl=1 471w, https://i1.wp.com/www.allencheng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div><p><a href="https://a16z.com/2020/05/28/moats-before-gross-margins/" target="_blank">Moats provide an enduring competitive advantage</a>. The wider and deeper the moat, the higher the barrier to entry to compete with your business, and the less capably a hotshot teenager can start a new company to compete.</p><p>If a moat is shallow, hundreds of competitors can pop up overnight and provide a good-enough competing product. If you can’t build a meaningful product advantage, then the grounds of competition shift to other dimensions of competition—namely, marketing and distribution.</p><h3><strong>The Parable of Online Mattresses</strong></h3><p>The online mattress industry had shallow moats and played out predictably. A few years ago, if you wanted to start a new mattress company, you only needed to cobble together a few components:</p><ul><li>A manufacturer</li><li>A website</li><li>A marketing campaign</li></ul><p>At the peak of the industry, there were <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/18/there-are-now-175-online-mattress-companiesand-you-cant-tell-them-apart.html" target="_blank">175 online mattress companies</a>. None had a meaningful product advantage—many used the same mattress manufacturers. (And having personally tried several of these mattresses in stores, they really did feel about the same.)</p><p>The grounds of competition thus shifted to marketing and branding, which is why a year ago you heard so many podcast ads for Casper, Purple, and the like. When product 17 and product 130 are identical, then the only way to win is to get buyers more familiar with product 17. But <strong>when competition meets a narrow dimension of competition, profits evaporate</strong>—companies bid up marketing prices to the highest that they can endure. It became a game of chicken—how much are <em>you </em>willing to spend to acquire a customer? The best-funded startups “won” this branding battle.</p><p>But this was a short-lived victory. <strong>The ultimate result: perpetually unprofitable businesses</strong>, with <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/cspr/financials" target="_blank">companies spending most of their revenue on COGS and user acquisition</a>. Casper now has a market value of just $350 million, down from its peak private valuation of $1.1 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the real beneficiaries of all this funding are:&nbsp;</p><p>1) the companies selling shovels in the gold rush, including mattress manufacturers and marketing platforms (particularly Google and Facebook)</p><p>2) customers, who enjoyed rock-bottom mattress prices subsidized by venture capital.</p><p>This situation played out in meal kit companies too, and one could argue the same is true of Uber vs Lyft and the food delivery war going on now.</p><h2><span id="Can_You_Differentiate_Yourself_with_GPT-3"><strong>Can You Differentiate Yourself with GPT-3?</strong></span></h2><p>Because GPT-3 works so well out of the box, I see this playing out a similar way. To start a new AI company, you need only cobble together a few components:</p><ul><li>A product built on GPT-3’s (very easy to use) API</li><li>A website</li><li>A marketing campaign</li></ul><p>As we see with Twitter demos, the products you can make off the shelf will frankly be pretty good.</p><p>Unfortunately, most of the products built on GPT-3 will be identical to each other, and few will have a meaningful edge. We’ll dive more into this next.</p><h3><strong>Differentiated Technology</strong></h3><p><strong>To win a market with technology, your product needs to be <em>obviously</em> better to the user.</strong> When Google first came out, it delivered such better search results than other engines—possibly by a subjective factor of 10 or more—that there was little reason to use any competitor. When Dropbox first came out, its syncing and ease of use was unbeatable. Right now SpaceX has a rocket that can do what no other company’s can, at an unbeatable price. These companies have real technology moats.</p><p>In contrast, if an industry has products that are are more or less identical—like online mattresses—the grounds of competition shift elsewhere other than product (like marketing and distribution), and there is no technology moat.</p><p>So imagine: If 100 companies build an AI therapy bot with GPT-3, how different will their user experiences be? How far ahead will company #1 be above company #2, and then over company #10? <strong>Will there be a 10x difference? Or more like a 5% difference?</strong></p><p>I argue: <strong>The better GPT-3 works out of the box, the harder it will be for any single company to build meaningful differentiation.</strong> Frankly, <a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1283326066338062337" target="_blank">early demos already look very good</a>.</p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I thought you made a good point so I did another run being as depressive as I could. I sampled most “John” lines only once, I think I ran one twice. I’m really impressed</p><p>The prefix makes a difference but that could be automatically prepended by an end-user therapy app <a href="https://t.co/YZmQL9EXqW" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/YZmQL9EXqW</a></p></div>— Nick Cammarata (@nicklovescode) <a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1283326066338062337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">July 15, 2020</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>Imagine how much better it can get with just a <em>little</em> more work—a modicum of fine tuning on therapy conversations and user safeguards. This is the new baseline, the “table stakes” for any new entrant, which is going to be relatively easy to achieve.</p><p>And then from this baseline, how much better could any one company get?</p><p>Here’s one way to think about it. The pinnacle of AI therapy would be a bot that rivals the <em>best</em> human therapist. Call this the 100% experience. The <em>average</em> human therapist might be somewhere at the 85% bar. And then a human user might be willing to tolerate a “good enough” AI performing at 70%—it’s clearly worse than a human therapist, but usable enough that it can keep up a coherent conversation and remembers that you were bullied in 5th grade.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/d-9mr1Bo8EgQaIlWnKd4EQuSrjjJuoBmjOkpcbPwJ0h9xnyIGz832tT133eTopDQZQWr2pXAJ-lS9mhaP9KBInUCnGtSqJKAtdZV-acn55hQ25c-p7bwdHgjyl-zFJ54I9Hg4aVX" alt=""></figure><p><strong>Before GPT-3, building anything </strong><strong><em>close</em></strong><strong> to the Good Enough AI was really hard.</strong> A company would have needed to invest many millions into its own algorithms and data cleanup to get anywhere close to the human user bar.&nbsp;</p><p>In this environment, the leading company had a few advantages:</p><ul><li>The barrier to entry was high, so it faced less competition.</li><li>The spread between the #1 and #3 companies was high, meaning the leading company had a sizable moat.</li><li>It still had a lot of room to grow to get to 85%+ level—this is room in which it could carve out a meaningful edge over competition.</li><li>It owned its own technology, so it could iterate to continuously improve its experience.</li></ul><p>Here’s how the landscape might have looked:</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Fz675xiZWljHeS4HWUGNcrO8qbaLtjJ9zfqJNCa2HhthN84Nt7JCQpMMhC4SzO9dWfSkGpWxOwIkaz745S-XJijAd91g0JDS2A7nDXrv6ku2fckVbW5kCl-UEyZci3tRgrb4aNwl" alt=""></figure><p>(In practice, I don’t know of any <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/chatbots-reviews#7" target="_blank">pre-GPT-3 AI therapy bot</a> that comes anywhere close to a human therapist. So competitive lead notwithstanding, I don’t think there have been any good AI therapy businesses to date.)</p><p>Then comes GPT-3. <strong>Now <em>anyone</em> can produce a “good enough AI therapy bot,”</strong> with a modicum of fine-tuning and UX design. This outcome wouldn’t be shocking—people were producing <a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1283326066338062337" target="_blank">plausible demos</a> within days of accessing the private beta. Imagine what can be done with just a few weeks of work and $500,000 of investment.</p><p>The result: the range of competition narrows:</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/BiYRcsL4EKmlGKyc5gFDCCkQ_79ijr-jBknzfVb2MVuPj-Rp-D56fLeNhVnV9F46I3tWmUgzJLfV_hh5Q-oOZuR531DWJwI11JKQWgRfFt0fDDDGybrQX7yuTvAGp0TDWmem8_K5" alt=""></figure><p>Compared to the previous situation:</p><ul><li>There are many more competitors who can offer a “good enough” product.</li><li>The range of competition is compressed into a narrower band. It becomes much harder for any single product to stand out from the median product, which is already quite good.</li><li>Because the companies don’t own the core technology behind GPT-3, their ability to improve beyond the baseline performance is limited. Yes, they can fine-tune GPT-3 with their proprietary data, but how much is this going to improve on the core algorithm, which <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/11/openai-launches-an-api-to-commercialize-its-research/" target="_blank">cost $12 million to train</a> on 40GB of Internet text? <strong>And won’t everyone else be fine-tuning like this too?</strong></li></ul><p>Again, this really gives credit to OpenAI for how well GPT-3 works—out of the gate, you can produce a pretty usable product.

<blockquote><p>“I’m here for one reason and one reason alone. I’m here to guess what the music might do a week, a month, a year from now. </p><p>That’s it. Nothing more.”</p><cite>John Tuld, <a href="https://youtu.be/UOYi4NzxlhE?t=83">Margin Call (2011)</a></cite></blockquote>
<p>A lot of time in the tech community is dedicated to understanding growth and moat dynamics like network effects and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=loops%20from%3Akevinakwok&amp;src=typed_query">loops</a>. While both of these components contribute to the building of individual companies, business models, and sectors, inflection points are the bookends to all of those and more, representing the beginning and end of larger movements.</p>
<p><strong>If loops are the power source that accelerate the flywheel, inflection points build the physical properties of the flywheel, create the initial spin, and eventually are the resistance which stops the wheel dead in its tracks.</strong></p>
<p>Andy Grove defines inflection points as “an event that changes the way we think and act.” There are few skills as powerful as understanding when things change.</p>
<p>Matt Cohler of Benchmark <a href="http://matt cohler job is to see the present clearly" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">once said</a> “<em>Our job as investors is to see the present very clearly, not to predict the future.”</em>&nbsp; </p>
<p>This quote is often <a href="https://www.quora.com/You-were-quoted-in-2012-about-VC-as-saying-My-job-is-not-to-predict-the-future-its-to-notice-the-present-first-What-do-you-notice-these-days" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">misinterpreted</a>. Seeing the present clearly is merely one function in the equation. In reality it is understanding what the past and present does to the future that matters most.</p>
<p>As seed stage investors, we help companies build, survive, and scale, but one of the main components of my job is understanding how and when the world is going to change. Our portfolio is a collage of various futures that we believe in, and our capital and expertise are assets to hopefully pull these futures forward.</p>
<p>Within <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://compound.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Compound</a> we often speak of <em>technical inflection points</em> as a concept that we love and deeply understand. When we say this, we mean companies that are creating or utilizing a sizable technological shift to create a venture-scale business. While many of our companies do follow this paradigm, at a higher level our focus in being thesis-driven is to understand multiple types of possible inflection points and predict the timing of such events in order to build various&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@compoundvc/compound-theses-1f97fc56e436" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">theses</a>.</p>
<p>If we are to understand what the next decades of inflection points are to hold, we must build a framework for how to look at these important events.</p>
<h3><strong>WHY INFLECTION POINTS Matter</strong></h3>
<p>Whether you’re an investor, researcher, startup founder, or scaled operator, by understanding inflection points, you’re able to best position yourself to be ahead of where the futures you believe in are going. Decoding inflection points past, present, and future all have varying value.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Past inflection points</strong> allow you to pattern match prior events to the present and future, as well as build a better view on where in a given cycle you are, or what other next order effects could come.</li><li><strong>Present inflection points </strong>allow you to identify how to prioritize learning, understand competitive dynamics, as well as begin to more properly look at companies through this lens to answer the most important question of “why now?”</li><li><strong>Future inflection points</strong> allow you to understand who are the types of people that can bring forward this future, and invest in a longer-term time horizon of building institutional learning and brand network effects to be best positioned to exploit the first and subsequent waves that result from the given inflection point.</li></ul>
<blockquote><p>Given the amorphous nature of an inflection point, how do you know the right moment to take appropriate action, to make the changes that will save your company or your career? Unfortunately, you don’t.</p><p>But you can’t wait until you do know: Timing is everything…When you’re caught in the turbulence of a strategic inflection point, the sad fact is that instinct and judgment are all you’ve got to guide you through.</p><cite><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66863.Only_the_Paranoid_Survive_Lessons_from_the_CEO_of_INTEL_Corporation">Only the Paranoid Survive</a>, Andy Grove, 1998</cite></blockquote>
<p>Thinking through these allow us to be better prepared to navigate the proverbial idea maze and understand what ripple effects users, researchers, companies, and governments are creating, to inform our decisions today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>This understanding can build a core knowledge base which helps answer questions including (but not limited to):</p>
<ul><li><strong>Who/what are the existential or emerging threats to my area of focus? </strong></li><li><strong>Which parts of the stack are ready to be built within a given category?</strong></li><li><strong>Where will value accrue/moats be built in both the short-term and more importantly, the mid to long-term</strong>?</li><li><strong>Who are the right groups of people that are best positioned to build in a given space?</strong><ul><li>Examples of this include the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://medium.com/@mhdempsey/2007-darpa-grand-challenge-roster-e1d05fccf428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2007 DARPA Grand Challenge roster</a> (they formed much of the basis of the self-driving industry for the next decade), the early Willow Garage team (built ROS and founded multiple robotics companies), and even early researchers in deep learning that were deemed too early (and crazy) like Geoff Hinton and Yann Lecunn and their resulting students/researchers that went on to build some of the first deep learning startups in the 2010s.<sup data-mfn="1">1</sup><span data-mfn="1">We often call these groups “mafias’ however there is a notable difference between the underlying founder/market fit within these groups versus a perceived broader excellence like is interpreted in the Paypal Mafia, as well as with potential mafias today made up of ex-Stripe, AirBnB, or Uber employees. There is signal here though in some specific groups. For instance, as data science became incredibly complex with large datasets, we saw a ton of institutional knowledge creation within large companies like Uber, leading to a strong founder/market fit for these teams to spin out core internal technologies and democratize them for the masses as second-mover companies needed new infrastructure.</span></li></ul></li><li><strong>What is the scale of value creation we will see within a given company or industry?</strong><ul><li>Series B+ venture investing has become increasingly about having a view on outsized value creation relative to other investors, which then drives round pricing. For those that understood the scale of technology proliferation, as tech went from local to global, and capital intensive to scalable, there was meaningful alpha relative to others who didn’t anticipate these changes.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>Inflection points matter because they create shifts that cascade down for multiple decades and can cause companies to outlast, take advantage of, and thrive during bull markets, and more relevant today, downturns.</p>

<blockquote><p>Great companies are started in all markets.</p><cite>– All VCs as the world began to meltdown due to COVID-19</cite></blockquote>
<p>Over the past few months, as the reality of our economic situation has set in due to the COVID-19 pandemic, tech’s echo chamber has produced a rallying cry of <em>“Great companies are started in all markets”</em></p>
<p>This echo chamber paired with our industry’s blind optimism can lead to a proliferation of startup cliches that miss the forest for the trees and/or are frozen in time, not naturally evolving with our tech ecosystem. Statements like:<em>“Do things that don’t scale”</em>, <em>“Move fast and break things”</em>, and today <em>“Great companies are started in all markets”</em>.</p>
<p>This paradigm is comforting during an onslaught of horrible news and seemingly little light at the end of the tunnel in the near term, as we sit inside our homes in some semblance of fear or exhaustion from the world, seeking respite on Zoom calls, Twitter threads, and Clubhouse rooms.</p>
<p>We are missing what is really happening. Great companies are not merely built at all times just because we say so. Though, there are reasons as to&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;many say this.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Startups are outliers building on a decade long timeline.</strong><sup data-mfn="2">2</sup><span data-mfn="2">This is probably the strongest argument of any, and also the most hand-wavy. Startups are built on multi-year timelines, but the unfortunate reality is they are slaves to fundraising cycles as they trade profits for scale. Despite the continual cry for alternative financing products and steady growth, as private markets have become incredibly well-capitalized and institutionalized at all stages of the venture capital stack, it can be necessary to make that trade in order to survive as a venture-scale company.</span></li><li><strong>Broader competition theoretically decreases during a recession. </strong>This can happen across incumbent, talent, and startup company competition. <sup data-mfn="3">3</sup><span data-mfn="3"><strong>Incumbents:</strong> Incumbents must focus and slow-down non-core areas of investment. This is the weakest argument in 2020. We have the most innovation-hungry and sprawling incumbents in history and are not slowing down during this time. If anything they finally see opportunities to deploy their war chests of cash towards these large scopes of ambition.<br><strong>Talent:</strong> While layoffs could bring down the cost of talent marginally, Facebook announced plans <a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/facebook-hiring-10000-workers-small-business-grants-1234570018/">to add 10k+ workers in 2020</a> and with the rise of remote work, the incumbents aren’t just shopping in our tech capital backyards anymore.<br><strong>Capital availability and startup company competition:</strong> All rounds of the private capital stack have institutionalized as private markets have shown that they increasingly are capturing a massive % of returns. Some founders may wait out the downturn before diving into a new company, but&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/mhdempsey/status/1214655919293894661">we learned last year that capital is not a differentiator</a>, and there is plenty of depth within private markets to fund fast followers, and mega-fund multiple ideas. Being a founder for better or for worse is now seen as a job, and there are many who will not stop applying for that job.</span></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.kauffman.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/theeconomicfuturejusthappened.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">That Kauffman Study</a></strong> from 2009 that highlights 57% of Fortune 500 companies were founded during a recession. <sup data-mfn="4">4</sup><span data-mfn="4">This data is borderline worthless in 2020, especially as we’ve seen replacement rates continually increase.</span></li></ul>
<h4><strong>What Actually Happened?</strong></h4>
<p>What we see during downturns is a strong proliferation of have and have nots within the tech ecosystem, where certain categories are materially overbid, while others are near impossible to raise for.</p>
<p>When we look at past recessions through this lens we can obtain learnings about the catalysts surrounding the various companies<em> </em>that lived and died through these recessions and how this influences haves and have nots moving forward.</p>
<p>These catalysts …</p></div></article></div></div></div></div>

<p>Mexico's new copyright law was rushed through its Congress without debate or consultation, copy-pasting the US copyright system into Mexican law as though America's system was working perfectly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/mexicos-new-copyright-law-puts-human-rights-jeopardy">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/mexicos-new-copyright-law-puts-human-rights-jeopardy</a></p>
<p>The law poses grave risks to Mexicans' human rights, especially (and most obviously), their right to free expression.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/how-mexicos-new-copyright-law-crushes-free-expression">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/how-mexicos-new-copyright-law-crushes-free-expression</a></p>
<p>But perhaps even more urgent is the impact this law will have on the Mexicans' cybersecurity: the security of their devices and thus the integrity of their data and even their personal safety:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/mexicos-new-copyright-law-cybersecurity-and-human-rights">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/mexicos-new-copyright-law-cybersecurity-and-human-rights</a></p>
<p>The new law imports the USA's "anti-circumvention rule" – a rule that makes it both a criminal and civil matter to tamper with the "technical protection measures" that restrict access to a device, even if it's your device, and even if you're not infringing copyright.</p>
<p>This law has been a serious impediment to independent security audits – when a researcher investigates the devices we're using, to ensure that they aren't leaking our data or exposing us to risk – say, by allowing hackers to send lethal shocks to our implanted pacemakers.</p>
<p>That's because security testing often involves bypassing a TPM to get at the device's internals, and the output of those tests is often "proof of concept" code, which incontrovertibly demonstrates the defects, overriding any denials from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Both of these run afoul of both US and (new) Mexican copyright law, and since the only way to determine whether a system is secure is to subject it to independent scrutiny, this leaves devices vulnerable to serious attacks with real consequences.</p>
<p>Mexicans have direct experience with this. Pegasus, a digital weapon sold by the arms dealer NSO Group, was used to attack independent journalists, anti-sugar campaigners, and even young children:</p>
<p><a href="https://threatpost.com/pegasus-spyware-targets-investigative-journalists-in-mexico/139424/">https://threatpost.com/pegasus-spyware-targets-investigative-journalists-in-mexico/139424/</a></p>
<p>The same weapons were implicated in the Saudi kidnapping, murder and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi; they rely upon lingering security defects in devices that the arms dealers exploit and sell to dictators and wealthy thugs.</p>
<p>Like the US law, the Mexican law contains an "exemption" for security research; in fact, it is nearly a verbatim translation of the US clause. That exemption is entirely useless. How useless? In 22 years, no one  in the USA has ever managed to use it.</p>
<p>And in case there was any doubt, the US Copyright Office has officially acknowledged the insufficiency of this exemption and has created larger, more explicit carve outs (that are still insufficient).</p>
<p>The US law lets the Copyright Office make these changes; the Mexican law not only does not define a process for fixing these overreaches, it's also starting without the USA's 22 years' worth of exemptions.</p>
<p>No nation can afford to tie the hands of cybersecurity researchers. Mexico's lawmakers could have easily written a law that accommodated security – all they'd have had to say was, "None of this applies unless you're infringing someone's copyright." They didn't.</p>
<p>Now it's down to the National Commission for Human Rights, which has until Jul 31 to announce that it is reviewing the law. If you are in Mexico or are Mexican, here's a petition to the Commission:</p>

<p>Late last June, Google bought out "North," a tech company based in Waterloo, ON, which manufactured "Focals," a line of "smart glasses." A month later, the company is turning off the servers the glasses rely on, bricking every pair they ever sold.</p>

<p>The company is refunding its customers' money, but this is cold comfort for many. As I said when Microsoft revoked every ebook it ever sold by shutting off its DRM server:</p>
<p>"When I was a bookseller, nothing I could do would result in your losing the book that I sold you. If I regretted selling you a book, I didn't get to break into your house and steal it, even if I left you a cash refund for the price you paid."</p>

<p>Why would Google do this? The company stonewalled CTV News, but we can make some guesses.</p>
<p>First, Google is incredibly bad at making wearable products. They've spent hundreds of millions on glasses and watches and they all sucked and flamed out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/canadian-smart-glasses-going-offline-weeks-after-company-bought-by-google-1.5042010">https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/canadian-smart-glasses-going-offline-weeks-after-company-bought-by-google-1.5042010</a></p>
<p>Historically, companies that were bad at something would lose to companies that were good at it. But in the new Gilded Age, where we no longer enforce antitrust laws, companies that are bad at things can buy up companies that are good at them, a monopolistic tactic.</p>
<p>Google's buying a lot of wearable companies, like Fitbit. They have a buyer's market, because the company has stockpiled billions by maintaining the absurd pretense that it was headquartered somewhere in the Irish Sea, in a state of tax-free bliss.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/20/oil-in-the-cloud/#buying-things">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/20/oil-in-the-cloud/#buying-things</a></p>
<p>This isn't an advantage that its nascent rivals enjoy – until you have billions, you can't hide billions, because the enablers who create trusts and Double-Irish Dutch Sandwiches and other polite names for "fraud" are not interested in your business.</p>
<p>Google – and other Big Tech companies – literally buy companies more often than I buy groceries. This is by design: the companies have used monopolistic tactics to effectively foreclose on the possibility of their being unseated.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/16/labor-investors/#big-goog">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/16/labor-investors/#big-goog</a></p>
<p>As a result, the "exit" that most founders and investors seek from tech startups is acquisition – generally an "acqui-hire," where a company is purchased for its engineering team. The product is scrapped and the team become employees.</p>
<p>The "acquisition" fee is really just a hiring bonus, with a finder's fee to the "investors" disguised as a share purchase. America's tech investors are largely headhunters, a glorified, inefficient job-placement service.</p>
<p>And the "products" that the "investors" pay "founders" to make aren't really products: they're portfolio pieces, a post-grad project to prove that you can execute a product design.</p>
<p>The product was never intended to be used by humans – you, the customer, are simply a proof-of-concept. It's a wasteful, idiotic system that throws billions at imaginary products for the purpose of shifting fractional points from Big Tech's balance sheets to investors.</p>

<p>For a glimpse of the future of agriculture and energy, check out Justin Rowlatt's fascinating article on the role of solar energy in Afghan heroin cultivation, a booming phenomenon that has boosted yields from a single annual harvest to two or three.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-53450688">https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-53450688</a></p>
<p>As Rowlatt points out, there's only one reason that the heroin industry changes: to increase its profits. The switch to solar in war-torn Helmand is driven by the plummeting price of solar energy, not local subsidies or climate concerns.</p>
<p>Which is not to say that climate and subsidies aren't playing indirect roles here. Part of the reason solar panels are so cheap is that they scaled up thanks to subsidies elsewhere, like Germany and the USA; those countries' subsidies drove R&amp;D; and production efficiencies.</p>
<p>The solar is driven by droughts, which send farmers questing for water with deep wells, draining nonrenewable fossil aquifers. In theory, farmers elsewhere could use solar to power desalinators, but that has its own climate consequences (salt flushed into coastal waters).</p>
<p>And while Helmand's farmers don't just grow opium poppies – one farmer featured in the article also grows tomatoes – the global flood of cheap heroin has real humanitarian consequences (of course).</p>
<p>But all of that doesn't change the essential fact illustrated by solar uptake among these poor, illegal, desperate businesses: solar is cheap and easy. In the Lashkar Gah market, "solar panels are stacked 3 storeys high."</p>
<p>"And what the changes in Afghan opium production show us is that having a source of power independent of any electricity grid – or fossil fuel supplies – can bring significant innovation."</p>

<p>In "The molecular basis of thioalcohol production in human body odour," biologists from the University of York trace human body odor to a metabolite of the enzyme Cys-Gly-3M3SH when it is consumed by the bacterium staphylococcus hominis.</p>

<p>The source of the "pungent, cheesy, oniony smell" has been something of a mystery because thioalcohols – the smelly substance – are not produced by most of our the microorganisms in our skin biomes. The team isolated the source of thioalcohols as a waste product of staph h.</p>

July 30, 2020 | https://www.range.co/blog/12-questions-with-gabe-kleinman | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.range.co/blog/12-questions-with-gabe-kleinman">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p>The <strong>12 Questions</strong> series takes you into the minds of influential leaders to discuss today’s hot topics. Read their fresh views on leadership, managing through change, and the ins and outs of modern work. Think of it as your office hours with some of the most innovative people in business.</p><p>The series kicks off with seven interviews around the theme of <em>resilience</em>. Our first guest is <a href="https://obvious.com/team/gabe-kleinman" rel="noopener" target="_self">Gabe Kleinman</a>, who leads portfolio services and marketing at Obvious Ventures.</p><p>Gabe has experience across a diverse range of functions and brands, having led not only People Operations at Medium, but also Product Marketing, Partnerships, and Social Impact. Before Medium, Gabe co-led the Design for Learning practice at IDEO, helping organizations in the private, public, and social sectors tackle large-scale challenges in education. Gabe began his career at Creative Artists Agency (CAA), working across CAA Marketing, the CAA Foundation, and strategic agency initiatives for over a decade.</p><hr><p><br><strong>Thanks, Gabe, for taking part in this series. To start, can you describe your career in 12 words or less?</strong></p><p>A lucky, nonlinear journey between people operations, storytelling, and client service.</p><p><strong>That's an eclectic mix. Given the current state of the world, more and more teams are talking about resilience. What does being resilient mean to you?</strong></p><p>Resilience on a personal level means being able to continue leading a purposeful life by adapting to shifting conditions on the ground, whatever those may be. It also means, especially today, learning to separate signals from noise, taking responsibility for your decisions and actions, and tightening the loop between strategy, reflection, and course correction. This holds true for businesses as well.</p><p><strong>You said, "especially today." So, how has your thinking about resilience changed in 2020?</strong></p><p>Times like these shine a bright light on simmering challenges that we all face, like the yawning wealth gap, parenting and time poverty, and structural racism. This year has helped me see that while some people and organizations are hardwired for resilience and others less so, we will feel the impacts of this at the community-level for decades to come—the good, the bad, and the ugly of it.</p><p>Anyone with school-age children sees this playing out in our education systems: some districts were made for this moment, while others have struggled mightily.</p><p>It is in our collective best interest to ensure that our institutions demonstrate resilience in their operations, which to me means doubling down on supporting the least well-off. I have taken this for granted in years past, but not anymore.</p><p><strong>How have you come to understand the importance of resilience in your career?</strong></p><p>I've come to learn that resilience doesn't mean simply "plowing through" bumps in the road that block you from your goal. It also means reevaluating your goals, and that the journey itself (at least for me) truly is the destination.</p><p>My path has been meandering, and at times bizarre as a result, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.</p><p><strong>Do you ever check-in with yourself, and if so, when was the last time you did?</strong></p><p>When I broke down crying at an all-hands meeting June 1.</p><p><strong>There's a story there—perhaps for another day. Can you think of a time when you wish you were more resilient?</strong></p><p>I always wish I could do a better job helping others be more resilient.</p><p><strong>What's one big mistake you made and how did you bounce back?</strong></p><p>Too many mistakes to count, but here's one. When I left my position at IDEO, I had one negative interaction amidst an overwhelmingly positive farewell. It changed the way I interact with everyone when transitioning away from one thing toward another.</p><p><strong>What are some mistakes we all make when it comes to resilience?</strong></p><p>We believe there's a right or wrong answer on how to proceed.</p><p><strong>As you said, it's a journey. So, how can people be more resilient in their work-life?</strong></p><p>By taking real ownership over the decisions we make, while understanding that not everything is within our control. It creates a positive bias toward action with a real and justified self-defense mechanism for when things don't go as planned.</p><p><strong>If you could leave people with one piece of advice about how to deal with what's happening right now in the world, what would it be?</strong></p><p>Don't be too hard on yourself — and set higher expectations for how we as individuals can make decisions for ourselves and the health of our communities.</p><p><strong>How do you usually stay connected with your team?</strong></p><p>I stay connected on the usual channels, but have found the most effective and meaningful way is to simply pick up the phone and talk.</p><p><strong>Are there any books or resources that you’ve found particularly relevant to this moment?</strong></p><p>Bringing together small groups of people to discuss challenges and solutions, even if online-only, can be deeply informative. I learned more moderating group calls with our CEOs and Chief People Officers than anything else I've read or seen — although I have found the <a download="" href="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/e422uarq/production/fc2ea7cdceb7fa547c6ae180a7f5ba98fb3c26c8.pdf?dl=remote-work-primer.pdf">Range Remote Work Primer</a> to be brilliant. 🙂</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@gabekleinman" rel="noopener" target="_self"><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/f7640570e5e99d6fb8b1aff1766046b3cf7d4d69-2316x2316.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;w=330&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="Gabe Kleinman having a dad moment"></a></p><p><strong>To make sure you don't miss our next 12 Questions article, <a href="https://www.range.co/newsletter">sign up for our newsletter</a>.

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596133872468_9471"><div><p>Click <a href="https://www.philma.me/projects/everything-is-securities-fraud/#Examples">here</a> to jump to the examples!</p><h4>An overly-long story</h4><p>A friend of mine turned me onto <a href="https://twitter.com/matt_levine">Matt Levine</a> earlier this year for reasons I can no longer remember, but for which I am very grateful. Matt is a former lawyer/banker and currently a writer for Bloomberg where he puts out a lunchtime newsletter (almost) every weekday called <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine">MoneyStuff</a> in which he provides his take on “Wall street, finance, companies and other stuff”. His writing style is uniquely approachable (given the subject matter) and he is in fact, hilarious. Reading the newsletter gives me (what I believe to be) at least a light finger on the pulse of finance which I otherwise find very difficult to keep up with. He also occasionally links to other writers/twitter people I follow which makes me feel validated.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-01-07/no-rush-repaying-these-student-loans">January</a> and then again in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-02-21/money-stuff-the-companies-are-on-the-same-team">February</a>, Matt wrote about <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2</a> (OpenAI’s language generation tool/model) and how cool/interesting people were putting it to use in cool/interesting ways. See: <a href="https://play.aidungeon.io/">here</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200310063743/https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/06/a-very-unlikely-chess-game/">here</a>. I had heard/read about machine learning in general and GPT specifically through headlines and the occasional doomsaying article, and I had played around with some of the text generators but it seemed like more of a diversion to me before Matt Levine brought it up (emphasis is mine): </p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;[GPT-2] is widely used as a sort of internet toy to write fake texts based on a model; <strong>you can put a paragraph of Money Stuff into GPT-2 and get back a new paragraph that kind of follows logically and kind of sounds like Money Stuff</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>and this:</p><blockquote><p>GPT-2 is an artificial-intelligence language model: You feed it a corpus of texts, and it gives you back some more texts that sound like they could have come from that corpus. <strong>You train GPT-2 on a bunch of Money Stuff columns, it learns to write Money Stuff, I am out of a job.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Challenge accepted? And so I sort of decided to take this on as a project to teach myself how to put together workable python code, and to dabble in ‘machine learning’. </p><p>Despite my reputation among my older family members, I am not much of a computer person. I was never formally trained in computer science, nor do I use it for work really. I have a vague understanding of how computers work mostly through googling problems as they arise, youtube videos, and from a brief period in the late 90’s where I would putz around on my computer aimlessly after I had run out of time on my AOL trial disk. I took a computer programming class (Pascal) in highschool, I sort of taught myself how to make rudimentary programs on my TI-83, I made it halfway through an online C++ course in college, and recently I took a more involved online course in Python geared towards data science. I thought that given my background, putting together a Matt Levine GPT-2 bot would take me like, a week. Tops. Lol. </p><p>I found a Matt Levine twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/MattLevineBot">bot</a> and some of those tweets are very good, but I wanted to have GPT-2 make entire articles! Someone had already done this too, and they named it <a href="https://0xnf.github.io/posts/ml/machinelevine/">Machine Levine</a>! But as far as I could find, the bot was no longer hosted and he didn’t provide any examples. I’m sure it worked just fine, but it didn’t use GPT-2, so I decided that my cause was righteous and set off. </p><p><em>(Note: Why not GPT-3? When I began this project in February, it was not released. Also, at the point in time that I’m writing this (July 2020) GPT-3 was only available for poking and prodding to a small cohort of people who know what they’re doing. Also, it would likely require a whole cluster of TPUs to train which Google will almost certainly not let me play around with.)</em></p><p>I started off by attempting to gather every article of MoneyStuff I could find. I receive the newsletter in my inbox everyday (ish) so I figured I could start there, but I had only been reading him for a few months so this would have produced a relatively small amount of text for training data. Or so I read. I tried directly asking for the articles through <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">BeautifulSoup</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html">Urllib</a>, and <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/">Selenium</a> but as it turns out, Bloomberg’s web admins are smarter and better at their jobs of web-admin-ing than a random person on the internet who just ‘learned’ python; surprise suprise! I kept triggering their bot-detection which was frustrating but fair since it’d probably be bad if they just let random people bombard their servers all the time with abandon. I ended up running a pretty simple <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">wget</a> script which was super friendly to their servers, which means it took like 2 days to run. I also subscribed to bloomberg for one of those gimme introductory trials since I felt bad for circumventing their paywall. </p><p>Next, I had to strip away the HTML and (and a bunch of other stuff I don’t understand) to get to the meat of the articles. My early attempts using various readability focused modules (<a href="https://newspaper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">newspaper</a>, BS4’s built in gettext, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/html2text/">html2text</a>) were unsatisfactory since they tended to leave weird parts of the header in, or truncated parts of the article which I wanted to keep (or equally as likely, I just didn’t know how to use them properly). They also completely stripped the formatting which was disappointing because I sort of wanted GPT-2 to be able to generate full articles with titles, subtitles, and paragraphs (again, probably a way around this. Perhaps my stackoverflow-fu is lacking). I ended up frankensteining together enough script (using BeautifulSoup) from stackoverflow to prune out the navigation bar, ads, videos, pictures, and self-recommending links. Then I deployed Selenium to open each HTML file, select all the text, and paste the text into a text file. I think that my approach was a spectacularly dumb and inefficient way to do this and there is almost certainly an elegant way to do it with regular expressions (AAAHHHHH) or something in like 4 lines. But alas, I am bad at this. </p><p>I do not own an enterprise-grade GPU, or any GPU at all for that matter. My Macbook Pro is about 8 years old, and is rocking a Core i5 with integrated graphics. This probably wasn’t going to cut it if I wanted to train even the smallest GPT-2 model in a reasonable amount of time. I googled around and found out that Max Woolf had created a <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VLG8e7YSEwypxU-noRNhsv5dW4NfTGce">Colaboratory notebook</a> with an attached GPU where you can run GPT-2 fine tuning for free! What a time to be alive. I settled on the 355M model (after reading up on what <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-2">Gwern</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/theshawwn">Shawn Presser</a> did earlier this year and in late 2019) because apparently this was the best I could accomplish using free Colaboratory notebooks. The colaboratory notebooks time out after 90 minutes and run for a maximum of 12 hours. So I wasted about half a week retraining the model after losing the checkpoint data on disconnect pretty much every day I tried it. So instead, I began just running it in batches everyday until I was satisfied. This is probably bad somehow, and there is likely a way to run fine tuning in Colab without babysitting, but you know. Whoops. </p><p>I don’t think I can stress this enough, but I don’t know what I am doing. I did not learn anything about actual Machine Learning through this project. GPT-2 was basically a black box for me which I fed a text file. Actual ML is likely way more complicated than I can reasonably imagine, and I honestly probably don’t remember enough math to get into the nitty gritty. Regardless, it was fascinating to see it go brrrr and spit out funny articles, and it was super cool of smart people to release these (super simplified) tools to the masses to play with. Anyway, the way to keep track of how well your model is doing (apparently) is by reading the ‘labeled’ numbers the terminal shoots out at you. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595860388311_4149"><div>

Avg is what I assume to be a running average of the loss which would show you a general trajectory of your model’s progress. As far as I could tell, this is only an average of the loss in the current training session. What I gleaned was that you’re supposed to read through the sample texts at the intervals you set (mine was every 500 steps) to check to see if the model is getting better, and also to check to see if your model’s loss is improving anymore (benefitting from further training) to know when to stop. In retrospect, I probably should have saved these terminal outputs and graphed the progress because it’d probably look cool and official to have that as a figure right about here. Oh well. </p></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596133872468_9025"><div><h4 id="Examples">Anyway</h4><p>

I certainly thought so anyway. For context, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-07-27/spacs-aren-t-cheaper-than-ipos-yet">here</a> is a random MoneyStuff article to compare his writing style and structure. I’d say the model does a pretty good job at getting the structure down. I added the formatting to these examples but the plain text generated clearly (through use of a new line) generates the article titles, subtitle, and section headings itself. I was most impressed with the model’s ability to emulate Matt’s unique style which really was the point of me making this so, yay. Unfortunately, GPT-2 seems incapable (or equally as likely, I am incapable) of generating texts long enough to match a typical MoneyStuff article which usually spans about 3-5 sections. Also, the section headings often don’t match the subtitles, although they do seem to at least track well with the main …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

            <p>Asynchronous means one at a time. That means each team member records their update video on their own time, and the rest of the team can review and reply on their own time.

July 30, 2020 | https://www.hughgrigg.com/posts/how-benefit-technical-reading-anki/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.hughgrigg.com/posts/how-benefit-technical-reading-anki/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

  

  <p><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> is one of my favourite pieces of software
ever, and it’s great to see that it seems to be getting more and more attention
as a valuable tool.</p>
<p>I often do a kind of learning-and-note-taking exercise with Anki when reading
technical content, which I’m writing up here.</p>
<p>It’s not complicated or dogmatic, and the current version boils down to three
tactics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloze deletion for easy conversion of text into notes.</li>
<li>Noting short code samples with a dedicated Code note-type.</li>
<li>Use screenshots to turn anything into simple memory prompt notes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s how each of those works for me. I’m using the article <a href="https://hakibenita.com/sql-tricks-application-dba">“Some SQL Tricks
of an Application DBA”</a> as an
example technical text that I recently went through with these note-taking
approaches.</p>
<h2 id="cloze-deletion-for-easy-note-taking">Cloze deletion for easy note-taking</h2>
<p>One powerful aspect of how Anki works is that it lets you set up any number of
different note types. One of the built-in types is for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test">Cloze
deletion</a>, which is an old and
powerful memory reviewing technique.</p>
<p>Cloze deletion simply means removing part of some material to make it into a
mini-test with the <a href="https://www.chineseboost.com/blog/simple-test-chinese-study-methods/">chance to be
wrong</a>.</p>
<p>What makes Cloze deletion so useful as a note-making technique is how easy it
is. Any text can easily be made into a note by applying Cloze deletion. This
takes a couple of seconds but is highly effective. You just copy-and-paste some
short text you’d like to use as a memory prompt, highlight a key part, and use
the keyboard shortcut to Cloze that part out (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ctrl + Shift + C<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cmd + Shift + C<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p>For example, in the SQL article, I made some Cloze notes like these:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>One way of “sorting a table on disk” by a specific index is to use the
{{c1::CLUSTER}} command.</em></li>
<li><em>Correlation measures how {{c1::“sorted”}} values of a specific
column are on disk.</em></li>
<li><em>Timestamp columns that keep track of when rows were created will usually
have a {{c1::correlation}} close to 1.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the goal with these is to act as a prompt for existing knowledge. It’s
supposed to keep you recalling what you learnt on a regular basis, so that your
mind keeps working on the memory and keeping it “alive” for you.</p>
<p>In other words, you are not trying to write down textbook-like explanations.
You are trying to create a memory trail of prompts that keeps your working
knowledge fresh and available.</p>
<p>Spaced repetition is a way to remember, not a way to learn.</p>
<h2 id="have-a-dedicated-code-note-type">Have a dedicated Code note-type</h2>
<p>As well as the versatile Cloze deletion note-type, I also have a Code note-type
in Anki. This is just a basic prompt/response note, except that I’ve named the
response side as “code” and applied a bit of CSS to it to put it in a monospace
font.</p>
<p>When I see short but useful or exemplary bits of code in technical content, I
just copy and paste them as one of these Code notes. Here are some examples that
I took from the SQL article:</p>
<p>Prompt:</p>
<p>“Sort a table physically on disk according to a specific index.”</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CLUSTER</span> <span>sale_fact</span> <span>USING</span> <span>sale_fact_sold_at_ix</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Prompt:</p>
<p>“See correlation of columns in a table.”</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>tablename</span><span>,</span> <span>attname</span><span>,</span> <span>correlation</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>pg_stats</span>
<span>WHERE</span> <span>tablename</span> <span>=</span> <span>'foobar_table'</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Note that they are short and readable in a couple of seconds, which is important
to make an effective card. Sometimes I edit the sample to make it a bit clearer,
and sometimes I just leave it.</p>
<p>Again, the goal here is not to perfectly memorise the response down to the
character. It’s to build a stronger memory along the lines of “there’s a way to
check column correlation in PostgreSQL and it looks something like this”.</p>
<h2 id="use-screenshots-to-turn-anything-into-a-prompt-card">Use screenshots to turn anything into a prompt card</h2>
<p>The third tactic is to make liberal use of screenshots to make general memory
prompts. This is similar to the Cloze deletion in that you can use it to turn
pretty much anything you have on screen into a long-term memory prompt.</p>
<p>There is an Anki plugin that lets you do actual <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1111933094">Cloze deletion on
images</a>, but I tend not to bother
with that.</p>
<p>Instead I just grab screenshots of various things and chuck in a simple
prompt/response note, with “What does this represent?” above the image as the
prompt.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if it’s very obvious from the image what it represents. For
example, I might put in a captioned diagram including the caption. The point is
to keep this diagram fresh in mind so that you can build on the knowledge it
represents.</p>
<p>There’s a big difference between looking at a diagram in an article or textbook
once, and seeing it over and over again in your spaced repetition system.
Pausing briefly each time to think about what the image represents makes it a
more active and useful memory for you long-term.</p>
<h2 id="wrap">Wrap</h2>
<p>Those are three ways I quickly make notes when reading some technical content
that seems useful to try and retain long-term. My Anki deck ends up as a
low-effort way to continuously review things I learned, often from several years
ago.</p>
<p>Finally, just as you can quickly create notes in this way, be willing to delete
them just as quickly. If a note turns out to be bothersome or unhelpful, delete
it. Both the deck and the knowledge-building are ongoing processes, and they
should be as frictionless as possible.</p>

<p>CTMU is a metaphysical theory of the universe by Christopher Langan, a man with the highest recorded IQ in the world. The crux of CTMU is that the universe is both procedure and object, code and data, function and parameter, effectively a self-modifying process that targets itself. The SCSPL<a href="http://ctmucommunity.org/wiki/Self-Configuring_Self-Processing_Language">[0]</a> is what CTMU terms as the BIOS or Operating System of our universe – it stands for Self-Configuring Self-Processing Language.</p>



<p>My main hypothesis is that the SCSPL is precisely the general solution to the Busy Beaver problem. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver">[1]</a></p>



<p>Assuming our universe is infinite, its `cosmic egg`, the program that represents our universe, is the solution to $\displaystyle{\lim_{n \to \infty} BB(n)}$</p>



<p>BB visits as many possible states as possible before halting. In simple terms it asks: Find the longest running program that doesn’t get stuck in an infinite loop. Classically, BB is a challenge for Turing machines. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">[2]</a> Turing machines are notoriously hard to program because they do not distinguish between code and data.</p>



<p>We can and should extend BB to Von Neumann machines <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_machine">[3]</a>, like the one that you are reading this post on right now. Von Neumann machines differ from Turing machines because they make a distinction between code and data by reserving memory for each. Upon execution of a program on a VN, it is simply copied from the hard drive to reserved, read-only memory. The instruction pointer of the CPU, known as EIP, points to memory location of the code to execute and simply increments every time the CPU runs a line of code. Loops and conditional statements are accomplished by adding or subtracting from EIP. This is known as jumping. The important takeaway here is that the code is static and unchanging and in turn, it resides in reserved memory that must remain static and unchanging.</p>



<p>In a VN, a memory module of n bits, has $2^n$ possible states. Assuming one of these is a halting state, we could in theory write a program that would run through all or almost all of these states. However, we would almost certainly need to scrap the paradigm of storing programs in unchanging, read-only memory. For example, if our machine has 100 bits of memory, and our program takes up 90 bits, we could only hope to write a program that iterates through all possible states of the 10 non-reserved bits, a measly 1024 states. This is a far cry from the enormous size of the memory space of all 100 bits ~ 12676506002 28229401496703205376.</p>



<p>Self modifying programs dwarf static programs in runtime. This is because the entire memory is used for the state space – not just a small data section. Unfortunately, other than in the niche underground culture of blackhats writing viruses and worms, the principles of polymorphic code are poorly understood. We barely understand how to write self-modifying programs and neither Mathematics nor Computer Science have researchers or categories of study dedicated to elucidating it.</p>



<p>The lack of knowledge on self-modifying programs is sad in so many ways but one practical application really hurts all of humanity: compression. Self-modifying programs are actually the most concise family of programs. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity">[4]</a> This is so much so, that a self-modifying program is what generates our entire universe.</p>



<p>If you care about having a real, tangible model of physics that rivals string theory and the standard model, then solving BB is imperative and urgent! Our place in the universe, in space and time, is many many steps into BB(∞). In order to peer back into the ontological basis of reality, our only solution is BB. Too many non-linear changes have occurred since the initial Big Bang, or BB, coincidence? I think not 😉</p>



<p>If there is a multiverse, BB would run through it. It truly is the holy grail representing the universe of ALL possibilities. I could go on, and talk about computational elements of self-modifying programs that reinforce themselves and create stable motifs, ala gliders in cellular automata, but I think this is enough for you to understand: BB is the code for our universe.</p>



<p>Let’s solve BB generally, for VN machines, and supplant string theory, particle physics, and bring the ontological computational truth back to reality on Earth. It is our duty.</p>

<![CDATA[How to Hire Great Engineers]]>

<article>
    <p>Hiring software engineers is one of the most critical yet hard
tasks you need to do to succeed as a company.</p>
<p>Large tech companies define “what a great engineer is” and the way
they hire them through trial and error. Rituals that work for them become
guarded secrets and considered a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Small and medium companies pick the crumbs of those rituals and fall into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult">cargo
culting</a>. They want to reap the same promised benefits of the obscure
interview rituals.  Yet they miss the reasons behind these rituals and do not
fully understand what trained interviewers exactly seek.</p>
<p>That is terrible from multiple perspectives.</p>
<p>First, what data do small companies have about interviews in a large company?
Usually, it is their own experiences they had going through the job interview as
a candidate. But they miss the training, the interview goals, and context about
the full hiring process. Thus, they often end up making an incomplete copy.</p>
<p>Second, imitation puts them in direct competition for the same pool of people.
And here large companies have several advantages. Not only they have a
well-defined hiring process, but they also can afford to pay more money.  For
some candidates, having a famous company in the CV is an interest as well.</p>
<p>Third, algorithmic interviews are direct translations from formalistic college
backgrounds. They do not bring the same value for small companies, as they do
for large ones. The former will get more value if they focus on the ability to
deliver and the speed of the delivery. Before diving into the rituals from a
large company, they have to survive long enough to become one.</p>
<h2 id="the-drawbacks-of-imitation">The drawbacks of imitation</h2>
<p>Imitating <em>what</em> large companies do without understanding <em>why</em> they do it is
risky. It will not give you the same results. And it can be even dangerous if
you apply it without consideration.</p>
<p>Alas, you probably do not even need their tools and processes in the first
place.  You might start needing them much later when your company is itself a
large one, but not today. Today your company is in a completely different place,
building a completely different culture.</p>
<p>You need to hire smartly.</p>
<p>You will need to think hard about how you want your company to evolve and grow.
What your company culture will look like, and particularly what you will reward.
Because <a href="https://jocelyngoldfein.com/culture-is-the-behavior-you-reward-and-punish-7e8e75c6543e">that is what culture exactly is</a>.</p>
<p>So, what will happen if you reward people for passing interviews? Then your
filter will likely select two types of developers. The first type is young
developers with freshly earned CS degrees. They will rock those algorithm
interviews.  They also will have little to no experience, but your filter is not
tuned to catch this.  Second—people who had spent the last month
memorizing the “Cracking The Coding Interview.” They will pass
as&nbsp;well, but you will have no assessment of whether they can apply their
knowledge.  That is, until their first deployment to your production
environment.</p>
<p>In our experience, <strong>rewarding the delivery</strong> works way better.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-hire-great-engineers">How to hire great engineers</h2>
<p>Long story short, <strong>great engineers deliver</strong>. The same way that great cooks cook.</p>
<p>Aline Lerner, from <a href="https://interviewing.io/">interviewing.io</a>, explains an interview process for a
cook in her <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/099-aline-lerner-of-interviewing-io">Indie Hacker’s</a> podcast:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was fascinated by how restaurants hire people.  If you want to work at a
restaurant, nobody gives a shit about your hopes and dreams. Nobody really
looks at your résumé. Your résumé’s meaningless in that industry as well.  You
just come in, and you bring your knives. In the morning, they show you how to
set up your station and your prepping. That means you are making sauces.  You
are chopping vegetables.  In some restaurants, they also put an onion in front
of you, and they are, like, “Chop this onion,” and you are, like,
“Okay.” Then you chop the onion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like common sense, right? So we double-checked that with one of our
engineers, who is a former chef. We asked him how the “whiteboard
interview equivalent” would look like for a chef:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unless you are working for the high-high-end restaurant, there would not be
any.  They would, instead, put you to the test for like 2-3 days to see how
you perform.  Part of that evaluation is to check how you interact with the
team, and if you share the same kind of jokes and values. The more natural it
is to work with you, the better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The restaurant industry figured the hiring way better than the software
engineering industry! They test both professional skills <em>and</em> cultural
alignment! In other words, they test your ability to deliver. They do not ask
you to <em>explain</em> a recipe by heart or <em>describe</em> how you would chop the onion.
They ask you to <em>do it</em>.  Live.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Their interview process answers the two most important questions: “Can you
deliver?” and “Can I work with you?”</p>
<p>We must apply this exact concept to the hiring of software developers.  If you
want to hire great engineers, your interview process must check if they can
deliver.</p>
<h2 id="chopping-the-onion">Chopping the onion</h2>
<p>AutoIterative was born to apply the same principles to the software engineers
hiring. We provide fun challenges that have to work in the production
environment to pass.</p>
<p>The production environment is on us, fully prepared for you to show your skills.
We give you git, CI pipelines, runtime, and automatic checking of your
solutions. Candidates bring their knives and chop the onions like they would do
during their day to day jobs.</p>
<p>The grading is automatic. We deploy solutions to the production environment and
check them over multiple dimensions. Does it work, is it correct, can it scale?
Does it properly handle the corner cases? In other words, if this code gets
deployed to your production environment, would it break and page you at 3 in the
morning?</p>
<p>Our grading focuses only on the behavior of the solution, eliminating irrelevant
details. This approach allows us to answer the “Can you deliver?”
question in its purest, distilled form.</p>
<h2 id="trying-it-out">Trying it out</h2>
<p>We invite you to try this idea on our platform.</p>
<p>To make it extremely easy to do, we lowered the bar as much as possible. Create
a <a href="https://ais.autoiterative.com/demo">demo account</a>, and you will instantly have access to a sample challenge
and some invites.</p>
<p>We recommend sending those invites to your current engineers for your mutual
enjoyment. They will have fun passing it, and could even pick a few ideas from
it for your CI improvement. And you will have the opportunity to check the
platform from the perspective of your hiring loop. We chose the demo challenge
to be approachable by a broad selection of engineers. Simple enough so that
junior engineers can have fun driving it to acceptance. Yet with complex enough
corner cases so that it is not a walk in the park for senior engineers.</p>
<p>And if you like it, please do let us know by dropping us an <a href="mailto:demo+feedback@autoiterative.com">email</a>.</p>
<h2 id="cultural-alignment">Cultural alignment</h2>
<p>No less important is the cultural alignment, the “Can I work with
you?” question. This topic is deep and fascinating, and we’re omitting it
from this post on purpose. It is worthy of a dedicated series of blog posts in
the future.</p>

PowerShell Universal v1.3 provides a ton of new features and big list of bug fixes. You can download the latest version from <a href="https://ironmansoftware.com/downloads/">our site or Docker Hub</a>. If you want to learn about the new features, they have all been <a href="https://docs.ironmansoftware.com/">documented</a>.</p><h2>API</h2><h3>Windows Authentication Support</h3><p>You can now use Windows Authentication with APIs. If you are hosting in IIS with Windows Authentication enabled, you can use the -UseDefaultCredentials parameter for Invoke-WebRequest and Invoke-RestMethod for authentication.</p><h3>Additional Built-In Variables</h3><p>APIs now have the following built-in variables.</p><p>$Headers – Provides a hashtable of headers that were provided in the request</p><p>$URL – Provides the full URL that was sent during the request</p><p>$Data – Provides a byte array of data for the content of the request. This is useful when processing files.</p><h3>New-PSUApiResponse</h3><p>This cmdlet provides the ability to return custom responses from APIs. You’ll be able to set the status code and even provide file contents to return.</p><h2>Automation</h2><h3>Scheduling Parameters</h3><p>We’ve added support for setting the parameters of scripts in a schedule. This means that you can use the same script and create multiple schedules with different parameters for that script.</p><p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/ironmansoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/schedule-1.png?ssl=1"><img data-attachment-id="26315" data-permalink="https://ironmansoftware.com/powershell-universal-v1-3/schedule-3/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/ironmansoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/schedule-1.png?fit=541%2C528&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="541,528" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="schedule" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/ironmansoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/schedule-1.png?fit=300%2C293&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/ironmansoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/schedule-1.png?fit=541%2C528&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i1.wp.com/ironmansoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/schedule-1.png?resize=541%2C528&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="541" height="528" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/ironmansoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/schedule-1.png?resize=200%2C195&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i1.wp.com/ironmansoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/schedule-1.png?resize=300%2C293&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/ironmansoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/schedule-1.png?resize=400%2C390&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i1.wp.com/ironmansoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/schedule-1.png?resize=500%2C488&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/ironmansoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/schedule-1.png?fit=541%2C528&amp;ssl=1 541w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/ironmansoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/schedule-1.png?resize=200%2C195&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i1.wp.com/ironmansoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/schedule-1.png?resize=300%2C293&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/ironmansoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/schedule-1.png?resize=400%2C390&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i1.wp.com/ironmansoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/schedule-1.png?resize=500%2C488&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/ironmansoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/schedule-1.png?fit=541%2C528&amp;ssl=1 541w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/ironmansoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/schedule-1.png?resize=541%2C528&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><h2>Dashboard</h2><h3>General Availability of Universal Dashboard</h3><p>We have moved the Universal Dashboard frameworks out of beta. They reached the point where we consider them useable for your production use. We’ll continue to fix issues in both frameworks and continue to add features to the UDv3 framework. Please continue to provide feedback on our <a href="https://forums.universaldashboard.io/">forums</a> and on <a href="https://github.com/ironmansoftware/powershell-universal">our issues page</a>.</p><h3>Built-In Component Management and Marketplace Support</h3><p>We’ve integrate the <a href="https://marketplace.universaldashboard.io/">Universal Dashboard Marketplace</a> with the PowerShell Universal admin console. You’ll be able to browse and install components from the marketplace.</p><p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-M6jY7sXTmhiAIMGYw_m%2F-MDPm28p1XIbuiJxoMY7%2F-MDPp2gZ8gbFgAtJD8k_%2Fimage.png?resize=915%2C536&amp;ssl=1" width="915" height="536" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-M6jY7sXTmhiAIMGYw_m%2F-MDPm28p1XIbuiJxoMY7%2F-MDPp2gZ8gbFgAtJD8k_%2Fimage.png?resize=915%2C536&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p><p>Once installed, you’ll be able to add components to dashboards for use.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="http://blog.nickwinter.net/upcoming-maniac-week">Last week</a> I set out to see how many hours of programming work I could do in one week on <a href="http://codecombat.com/">CodeCombat</a>, our multiplayer programming game for learning how to code. I clocked in at 120.75 hours. Here's the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0qlr22cF14">epic time-lapse video</a> I generated from <a href="https://github.com/nwinter/telepath-logger">Telepath</a> (watch in 1440p if you can):</p><figure id="w-node-b4ab708afc0e-58e10339"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E0qlr22cF14"></iframe></p></figure><p>So what did I learn from this experiment?</p><p><strong>Adjustable height desks are amazing.</strong></p><p>I bought one from <a href="http://www.ergodepot.com/">Ergo Depot</a> a few days before. I must have switched between sitting and standing fifty times last week. I would never have survived otherwise.</p><p><strong>Viking metal is stronger than sleep.</strong></p><p>I usually sleep for 8.5 hours a night. I thought that for this week I could be tricky, starting at 04:00 and sleeping later and later so I'd only have to sleep six times for maybe eight hours a pop. Not only did it totally work, but my wake times didn't advance as fast as my bedtimes, so I only lost 6.38 hours per day to sleep.</p><p>I thought this would make me tired and unable to concentrate on difficult programming, but energy and focus were actually really good except for one hour early Sunday night. I blame it on epic Viking metal and other super-energizing music, plus maybe the seven bars of 90% dark chocolate I ate. I had one or two cups of tea but no other caffeine, and I woke without an alarm every morning.</p><p><strong>It's euphoric to never have to stop coding.</strong></p><p>I hadn't realized I how much more I enjoy coding when I don't have to answer emails for a week. (Note the unread emails climb to 402 by the end.) Even fixing bugs, supporting Internet Explorer, and struggling with algorithms I don't understand are all fun when I know I'm going to win--that I'll solve the thing before anything can distract me. And listening to music is one of my favorite things, so having a week filled with just code and music? Wonderful!</p><p><strong>I speed up the longer I go.</strong></p><p>Normally, I work a focused-but-relaxed 60 hours in a week. I doubled that last week, but I feel like I was perhaps three times as productive. I could keep the problems in my head without cache eviction due to memory pressure. (I mean, there wasn't anything else to think about.) With ever-deepening focus, I felt unstoppable. It was like getting 4.5 40-hour weeks' worth of work done in one.</p><p><em>How much did you actually get done?</em></p><p>It's hard to compare, but here are the major projects I did:</p><ul role="list"><li>Moved all game <a href="http://cowboyprogramming.com/2007/01/05/evolve-your-heirachy/">Systems</a> out of the codebase and into the database with live-coding System editing from within the level editor</li> <li>Completely redesigned and rewrote the spell editor, in the process solving 31 Trello tasks that depended on a new editor architecture</li> <li>With Scott, wrote a parser for vector sprite assets that allows us to use vector art directly in our game engine instead of exporting raster sprite sheets</li> <li>Implemented automatic, dynamic <a href="http://www.ai-blog.net/archives/000152.html">nav mesh</a> <a href="http://udn.epicgames.com/Three/NavigationMeshReference.html">generation</a> to support A*-based pathfinding for any unit's artificial intelligence</li> <li>Added support for Internet Explorer 9-11 (and 9 doesn't even have web workers!)</li> <li>Moved all world victory condition configuration from code to configurable scripts, refactoring the goal management to allow more flexible goals</li> </ul><p></p><p>On top of those major projects, most of the work was in all the little Trellos I slew and bugs I fixed.</p><p><em>Okay, but was the code any good?</em></p><p>Yes. It's expressive, well-organized, and (to me) pretty, if not solid or fast yet. But...</p><p><strong>My coding style changed.</strong></p><p>Most nights last week I programmed in my dreams, with vivid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_effect">Tetris effect</a> one night of doing CSS tweaks. (One night I had a nightmare of watching a YouTube video and then panicking upon realizing I wasn't working.) Being that deep into my CoffeeScript, I found myself writing terser and terser code, since why do in five lines what you can obviously do in one? But as I coded, I didn't realize until too late that "obvious" is different between just-spent-120-hours-coding me and just-went-skateboarding me, let alone people are not me and <em>may not even know CoffeeScript if you can believe that.</em> Here's an example from spell_view.coffee:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ee5933dd8ba888022e10334/5ef0b7ced97fc3711e8c68d1_Screenshot2013111821.27.102b281ddcd7af03ddd45c107bb0d808e7.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>I don't even want to show you what the old code was, because it was uglier than a cowbear. But it was three times this long and did half as much. To me, this new code is luscious. But can a <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/02/portrait-of-n00b.html">sane coder</a> really understand this? Where are all the commas and braces and parentheses clarifying the operator and method call and array precedence?</p><p><strong>Processor speed changes everything.</strong></p><p>I had the idea to do this week a few months ago, but I wanted to wait until I could buy a freshly updated MacBook Pro to do it, since the old one was three years old and, though capable, pretty slow. After the laptop upgrade, I was surprised by how much more I wanted to work. The simple friction of slow builds and poor CodeCombat level simulation performance had been weighing down my enjoyment and efficiency this whole time. I'm never waiting three years to upgrade my gear again.</p><p><strong>This was a weird thing to do.</strong></p><p>Man barely moves for a week, staring at patterns of light on a flat object and trying to make the patterns change. Every 2-4 hours, a stimulus is presented and he records how happy he is. He eats and sleeps as fast as he can so he can go back to looking at the lights.</p><p>It is the happiest week he has ever recorded by a wide margin.</p><p>(I have been tracking happiness for over three years, and this week's average of 7.03 / 10 is a full 0.22 points higher than the week I first started writing <a href="http://www.nickwinter.net/the-motivation-hacker">my book</a> and learned to skateboard. Now, probably the best weeks are weeks when I wasn't at my computer consistently recording happiness pings, like the <a href="http://blog.nickwinter.net/wife-and-husband">week I got married</a> which was pretty much the best ever.)</p><p><strong>Overall, it was surprisingly easy.</strong></p><p>I think it would be much harder if I was under any stress (like deadlines), but this was just fun, and there were never any points when I wanted to stop working. I don't think I could hit these kind of hours without trying to set a personal record, though. (My previous record was only 87.3 hours.) I doubt I could have focused on only coding, rejecting all other activities, if I wasn't making a public precommitment and time lapse video of it.</p><p>I talked about my <a href="http://blog.nickwinter.net/upcoming-maniac-week">preparations and planning in the previous post</a>, which is exactly how it went down except that I kept waking up early. I asked for predictions as to how much I could do; friends guessed I'd do anywhere from 87.3 - 113 hours, with an average of 99.4. My wife Chloe wins the competition by guessing 113 (which was even higher than my own secret prediction of 112). So getting to 120.75 feels like an epic victory to me. Although my workweek offcially ended at 03:59, I couldn't go to sleep until 04:45 because I was so excited.</p><p>Final stats can be found in the last frame:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ee5933dd8ba888022e10334/5ee6ba2a202f05e6aded35c8_maniacweek1804f9d08782967b6b52cc5b94b8e7d6.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><p>Here are some stats that <a href="https://github.com/nwinter/telepath-logger">Telepath Logger</a> doesn't show:</p><ul role="list"><li>Average happiness: 7.03 / 10 (awesome!)</li> <li>Energy: 6.64 (high for me)</li> <li>Health: 5.33 (5 is "okay")</li> <li>90% chocolate bars eaten: 7</li> <li>Daily work average: 17.25 hours </li> <li>Hours awake but not working (eating): 2.6 (0:22 per day)</li> <li>Hours sleeping: 44.65 (6.38 per day, 7.44 per night)</li> <li>Seconds per frame: 55</li> </ul><p></p><p>Oh, and if you're wondering about the videos showing while I'm sleeping: it's just my screensaver. I extracted still frames from some other YouTube videos with ffmpeg at 705 frames per second so that when played back in real time at three frames every seven seconds split across three screens, the main screen would produce a thirty-frame-per-second rerendering of the videos in time-lapse time.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>If you prefer a video-tutorial, have a look at the following screencast, which follows the procedure described in this article step by step:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TY5iS8_1Dl4" width="672" height="378" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div>
<p><a href="https://www.nginx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360063198012/nginx.jpg" alt="nginx.jpg"></a></p>
<p>As a practical example, we are going to import the <strong>nginx</strong> application from the Docker Hub marketplace.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059758052/OpenNebulaMarketplaces.png" alt="OpenNebulaMarketplaces.png"></p>
<p>You can select <strong>nginx</strong> from the Apps tab.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059758032/OpenNebulaDockerHubApps.png" alt="OpenNebulaDockerHubApps.png"></p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059924111/OpenNebulaNginxApp.png" alt="OpenNebulaNginxApp.png"></p>
<p>Now download it by selecting the image datastore and optionally a tag of the Docker image</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059924091/ImportNginxApp.png" alt="ImportNginxApp.png"></p>
<p>When <strong>nginx</strong> is imported from Docker Hub, a VM template is also created. You'll have to update the template.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059758012/UpdateNginxVMTemplate.png" alt="UpdateNginxVMTemplate.png"></p>
<p>You can have to add a virtual network to access the <strong>nginx</strong> application</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059924051/AddNetworkNginxVMTemplate.png" alt="AddNetworkNginxVMTemplate.png"></p>
<p>A kernel image should be set in the OS section. The kernel boot parameters are already setup during the import process.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059757972/AddKernelNginxVMTemplate.png" alt="AddKernelNginxVMTemplate.png"></p>
<div>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>A kernel image for Firecracker microVMs can be imported from the OpenNebula Public Marketplace:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360063360031/OpenNebulaFirecrackerKernel.png" alt="OpenNebulaFirecrackerKernel.png"></p></div>
<p>And the start script.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059757952/AddStartScriptNginxVMTemplate.png" alt="AddStartScriptNginxVMTemplate.png"></p>
<p>Don't forget to update the Custom Vars with a root password of your choice.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059924031/AddCustomVarsNginxTemplate.png" alt="AddCustomVarsNginxTemplate.png"></p>
<p>Once the VM template is updated you can instantiate it to create a Firecracker microVM.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059757932/NginxVM.png" alt="NginxVM.png"></p>
<p>You can access the Firecracker microVM through VNC using the password you set earlier at the template's Custom Vars section:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360060207071/VNCNginxVM.png" alt="VNCNginxVM.png"></p>
<p>Now you can use your browser to access the <strong>nginx</strong> application by using the IP of your VM. Voilà! <span>🤓</span></p>

<p>A study published in medical journal <em>Memory &amp; Cognition</em> has found learning music does not have a positive impact on children's cognitive skills, such as memory and academic achievement.</p> 
<p>Giovanni Sala at Fujita Health University, Japan, and Fernand Gobet at the London School of Economics and Political Science in the UK, examined evidence on the effects of music training on children's cognitive skills and academic achievement.</p> 
<p>Previous research indicated a link between music training and better skills and performance, with some researchers even suggesting that playing an instrument can raise your IQ.</p> 
 
<p>But after analysing data from 54 studies conducted on 6,984 participants between 1986 and 2019, Dr Sala’s team found music training was ineffective at enhancing cognitive or academic skills, regardless of the skill type, participants' age and duration of music training.</p> 

<p>The authors found studies with high-quality design, such as those which used a group of active controls – children who did not learn music but instead learned a different skill, such as dance or sports, for example – showed no effect of music education on cognitive or academic performance.</p> 
<p>"Our study shows that the common idea that 'music makes children smarter' is incorrect,” said Dr Sala, the lead author.</p> 
<p>"On the practical side, this means that teaching music with the sole intent of enhancing a child's cognitive or academic skills may be pointless.</p> 
<p>“While the brain can be trained in such a way that if you play music, you get better at music, these benefits do not generalise in such a way that if you learn music, you also get better at maths.</p> 
<p>"Researchers' optimism about the benefits of music training appears to be unjustified and may stem from misinterpretation of previous empirical data."</p>

    <p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/rogue-wave/freakwave.jpg" alt="Freak wave"></p>

<p>During the pandemic, I’ve done my civic duty and spent lockdown reading a ton of random stuff on the internet. In the midst of a Wikipedia binge, I went down a rabbit hole on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_wave">rogue waves</a>: massive waves that occur in the middle of the ocean, endangering ships and generating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu4ogCy5d4k">kickass Youtube content</a>.</p>

<p>The concept of a rogue wave reminded me of a particularly challenging stage in the life of many venture-backed enterprise SaaS startups. Similar to how a rogue wave forms, during this phase many Small Problems coincide and create a Big Problem. Also like rogue waves, this moment in the life of a high-growth enterprise SaaS business is uncommon – it seems to occur around $5-20 million ARR, which relatively few companies reach, and can seem almost mythical. And finally, the effects of both rogue waves and this challenging startup stage are predictable: if you spend long enough on the high seas, they’re waiting for you.</p>

<p>I’ve seen this phenomenon both in-person as an operator and as an observer of other companies, and I do believe it’s real. I’m writing this essay in order to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share what I’ve seen</li>
  <li>Provide some opinions on what you can do about it</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully I can be the crusty old mariner bringing back tales that others find useful.</p>

<h2 id="hitting-the-wall">Hitting the Wall</h2>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/rogue-wave/boat.jpg" alt="Big boat, bigger wave">
Startups can be stressful</p>

<p>The rogue wave typically seems to hit between $5M and $20M in ARR. If you’re operating with a common venture-backed SaaS model of <a href="https://www.saastr.com/how-to-figure-out-your-competitors-revenues-in-about-70-seconds/">$1-200k ARR per employee</a>, this is around where you’ll hit the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191001-dunbars-number-why-we-can-only-maintain-150-relationships">Dunbar number</a> of ~150 people: the point where you can no longer operate as a large family, and need to start acting like a corporation. <em>(Note that the post linked is from 2012 – SaaS has since exploded, and more companies are raising huge rounds and hiring more on less revenue)</em></p>

<p>Crossing the 150-person barrier is both operationally and emotionally difficult:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Operational: We have so many teams, we need regular status reports!</li>
  <li>Emotional: Why do I need to send <em>you</em> a status report all of a sudden, I thought we were all friends here?!</li>
</ul>

<p>This transition point is also when many leaders who excelled in scrappy startup mode <a href="https://staysaasy.com/scaling/2020/06/27/hardest-part-of-startup-scale-yourself.html">struggle to level up</a> in a larger organization. Some successfully scale themselves (slow, painful) and others will leave the company (fast, but often even more painful).</p>

<p>Many of the first contracts that you closed post-traction come up for renewal around this point (in the enterprise – SMB SaaS has less predictable growth profiles). If you’re following a <a href="https://www.battery.com/powered/helping-entrepreneurs-triple-triple-double-double-double-to-a-billion-dollar-company/">triple-triple-double-double-double</a> growth path, you’ll be at roughly your second triple. There will be too many customers for the founding team to personally visit and retain everyone.</p>

<p>At this point you’ll need to renew “real” customers, not just friends who took a flyer on your infant product. These aren’t the earliest adopters who will be with you through thick and thin and are really closer to partners. These are real live paying customers who will leave if your product is screwed up. As these renewals approach, a mature post-sales motion becomes essential.</p>

<p>The expectations around your revenue also become more real at this stage. Under about $10M ARR, your revenue projections can be a mild shitshow. But the expectation that you’ll have at least some semblance of predictability steadily increases.</p>

<p>And through it all you need to continue to scale the product. Your code is no longer a series of never-ending green fields rolling off into the distance, and non-trivial parts of your product will need to be meaningfully restructured. You’re burdened by decisions made years ago, often by people who are no longer on the team.</p>

<p>This is especially true for enterprise SaaS. Enterprise products are much more unwieldy than jewel-box consumer products, as they have to support many more users and workflows. Consumer products are like Chipotle: a small, carefully curated set of menu items, built for elegance and efficiency. Enterprise products are like the Cheesecake Factory: you can get steak, pasta, a milkshake and 4 kinds of margarita in the same meal. You need to level up how your team builds products.</p>

<h2 id="cresting-the-wave">Cresting the Wave</h2>

<p>I’m writing about this phenomenon because if you haven’t seen or heard about it, there isn’t really a good way to realize that it might be coming. Even if it isn’t preventable, it’s better to know what’s on the horizon. After all, being able to see around corners is why many companies hire experienced operators.</p>

<p>I won’t claim to be an expert on how to react, but I can share a few things that I think work well and a few that don’t, and what I would do if I had to go through this phase again.</p>

<h3 id="the-crew">The Crew</h3>

<p>First, I would do my best to get the right team in place in advance. In particular, I would make sure that I had very strong functional heads for the functions that will be strained the most: Product, Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Support, and Customer Success. You don’t need every role covered, but it saves headaches to know that some parts of the team are bulletproof. This isn’t the time for unforced errors.</p>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/rogue-wave/pirate-crew.jpg" alt="Pirates of the Caribbean crew">
You want a senior crew. You can tell that Sharkman here has experience and won’t freak out when the database goes down or a large account churns.</p>

<p>I also recommend hiring senior team members who can help see around corners and anticipate issues. This is a taxing time period because it’s so damn busy, and raw, well-directed horsepower tends to carry the day in those situations. More importantly, seasoned operators have typically seen challenging times before, and have the composure to handle them calmly because they know that things are always on fire.</p>

<p>It’s tempting during these busy times to make very junior hires such as new college graduates or coding bootcamp grads just to put butts in seats. These folks can be excellent hires in calmer times, but the chaos caused by too many inexperienced employees is very difficult while you’re cresting the wave.</p>

<h3 id="steering-the-ship">Steering the Ship</h3>

<p>Startups are generally fairly stressful, and that’s heightened in this time period. When operational problems strike in stressful times, it’s common to blame the people involved rather than processes – in reality, bad processes or incentives are usually the root cause.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the faster you’re growing, the more lightweight your processes should be. When you’re in rapid scaling mode your operational tempo is constantly changing, so there’s no point boiling the ocean to create a perfect process when next month so much will have changed.</p>

<p>For example: when confronting a startup rogue wave, I would not choose to reinvent a completely new system for launching new features. Instead, use 20% of the time to set up a simple, predictable process that gives you 80% of the value. Example: set up a recurring check-in meeting where upcoming releases are discussed by PMs and Tech Leads + a Slack thread where all new releases are announced when they go-live. It won’t be perfect, but you can get this up and running in 15 minutes.</p>

<h3 id="commit">Commit</h3>

<p>This is not the time to hedge your decisions or waffle on strategy.</p>

<p>For example: in general, I prefer to give people a generous window of time to grow into stretch roles. Promoting from within builds continuity, leads to a more invested team, and motivates others by demonstrating that you’re creating strong career paths. But in this phase it’s especially important that you commit to keeping or replacing leaders fast, as there’s just too much going on.</p>

<p>If you’re 30% of the way up a 100 foot wall of water and decide to adjust course, you’re going to get slammed.</p>

<h3 id="keeping-calm">Keeping Calm</h3>

<p>Whatever you do, <em>don’t freak out</em>. When it feels like shit is hitting the fan everywhere, it’s easy to want to react and search for magic solutions. Hire a new Head of X! Spend less! No wait, spend <em>more</em>! Pause development and focus on tech debt! Actually our largest customer needs more features, cancel all tech debt projects!</p>

<p>In reality, to take a line from The Sopranos, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_po7So0MKq4">it won’t be cinematic</a>. Life isn’t a movie. There are no magic fixes – this challenging phase gets resolved by showing up and executing in an unflashy way for months. Magic fixes never really exist, and that’s especially true since this crucible stems from several medium-sized problems amplifying one another.</p>

<p>Searching for a unified solution to your troubles risks distraction. The road is reasonably straightforward and the challenges are tractable: there are just a lot of them. Just like an actual rogue wave, you can’t flee or dodge the factors that make crossing these rogue waves so difficult. You succeed by pointing your boat right at the problem and hitting the gas. Keeping calm doesn’t mean being stubborn or refusing to change, but it does mean that you can’t second guess your decisions – especially when it feels like you’re climbing a wall of water.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>Not everyone makes it over the wave – of the roughly 10 cases that I’ve observed, roughly half had their growth stunted for at least several years after hitting this stage. In my opinion this SaaS rogue wave should be taken seriously.</p>

<p>But the good news is that once you’ve crossed the wave, you can speed up again. As you’re rising up the wall everything goes into slow motion; but once you’ve crested the top, your acceleration can increase again as you’ve set yourself up with a more stable operating model and a hardened team.</p>

<p>This is a wonderful time, as there’s so much opportunity. Your team is still in place. The market opportunity is there, and people are buying. And once you’re over the top, the water is much calmer towards the horizon.</p>

<p>In conclusion:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Many challenging situations tend to arise simultaneously when high growth enterprise SaaS companies hit roughly $5-20 million ARR.</li>
  <li>The good news is that after this phase things get easier – the bad news is that it’s not easily avoidable.</li>
  <li>The best way to move forward is to focus on executing – and don’t be overly reactive.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><span>L</span>et’s start with the obvious question right away:
Why should anyone write a new application using ‘90s technology like Win32 API in 2020?</p>

<p>Well, if you are working at a company like ENLYZE, there are plenty of good reasons to do so:</p>

<ul>
<li>You need to send your customer a small and self-contained application which should just work without any installation</li>
<li>You don’t know if your customer’s computer is brand new or 20 years old, but you can be sure that it’s running Windows (welcome to the world of industrial manufacturing)</li>
<li>You want to create a familiar and functional user interface by using the operating system’s UI components instead of reinventing the wheel</li>
<li>You only want to do the job once, and therefore need a framework that is not going to be abandoned tomorrow</li>
</ul>

<p>If that also applies to your situation, welcome aboard!<br>
Even if not, this post may show you some interesting Windows frameworks to look at.
However, if your goal is to write a multiplatform application, you are probably looking for something like Qt or even Electron (if you don’t mind the umpteenth Chrome installation on your computer).</p>

<p>The Win32 API is probably the longest-living user interface framework still in use, with its initial release through Windows NT 3.1 in 1993 and its origins dating back to Windows 1.0 for 16-bit processors of 1985.<br>
It even predates the first C++ standard by a few years.
As such, don’t expect any fancy OOP classes or templates.
All you get is a purely procedural C interface, whose manual resource management and lack of encapsulation can make your life unnecessarily difficult in 2020.<br>
However, it has two major advantages no other Windows framework can offer:
Being the native user interface API, it comes preinstalled on every Windows version without requiring you to ship additional dependencies.
Furthermore, Microsoft has been keeping the API stable for more than 25 years, even when transitioning to 64-bit processors.
Win32 has thereby become a solid foundation not just for applications, but even for various user interface frameworks.</p>

<p>After releasing Win32, Microsoft introduced several other frameworks to ease Windows development, all with their own caveats:</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-foundation-classes">Microsoft Foundation Classes</h2>

<p>The <em>Microsoft Foundation Classes</em> (MFC) certainly make up the most prominent C++ framework around the Win32 API.<br>
They encapsulate almost all parts of the procedural Win32 API into object-oriented C++ classes.
They go even further and provide you with things not found in Win32, such as window splitters or helpers for a document/view architecture.
As you can imagine, all these features combined make MFC quite a heavyweight framework.
Your total binary size will increase significantly if you decide to use MFC.
Furthermore, MFC is as old as the Win32 API itself and therefore carrying a lot of legacy on top.<br>
If you want to develop a new Windows application using modern C++, there are usually better alternatives to MFC.</p>

<h2 id="active-template-library">Active Template Library</h2>

<p>The <em>Active Template Library</em> (ATL) proves that Win32 APIs can also be encapsulated into C++ classes in a lighter way.<br>
It is a mostly header-only library providing smart pointers and RAII wrappers around a delicate part of Win32, namely COM.
ATL is mature code with a stable interface, and as it comes bundled with Visual Studio, you don’t have the burden of managing the dependency yourself.
Consequently, you are advised to use it whenever your application deals with COM.<br>
There is no point in doing COM without ATL in 2020.</p>

<h2 id="windows-template-library">Windows Template Library</h2>

<p>The <em>Windows Template Library</em> (WTL) builds on top of ATL to provide similar template classes around the Win32 user interface APIs, not just COM.
It can be considered a lightweight alternative to MFC.<br>
However, it is a project run by a single Microsoft employee and severely lacking documentation, which is why I haven’t used it for my applications yet.
Your mileage may vary though.</p>

<h2 id="windows-implementation-library">Windows Implementation Library</h2>

<p>A young member to the 3-letter abbreviated frameworks is the <em>Windows Implementation Library</em> (WIL), another C++ header-only framework.<br>
It provides all sorts of wrappers for automatic resource management and simplified usage of Win32 APIs to make them ready for the modern C++ age.
Sounds exactly what we are looking for, right?
Well, not necessarily.<br>
WIL was originally called the <em>Windows Internal Library</em> and, as the name suggests, used exclusively inside Microsoft for Windows development.
As such, it generally targets the latest version of Windows and <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/wil/issues/97#issuecomment-540369663">doesn’t try to be a solution with backward compatibility in mind</a>.
This is no option for the applications I am developing, which may still find themselves running on an ancient Windows XP machine.
After all, backward and forward compatibility is also one of the major advantages of the Win32 API that shouldn’t be sacrificed easily.
No matter if that is a constraint for you or not, WIL is definitely worth a look though.
Even if you’re unable to use it directly, you may be able to take over some of its concepts in your application :)</p>

<h2 id="net-framework-and-net-core">.NET Framework and .NET Core</h2>

<p>Finally, let’s not forget about the <em>.NET Framework</em> and its Windows Forms library for user interface design.<br>
This usually doesn’t fit into an article about C++ development due to its entirely different paradigm:
Code for the .NET Framework is likely written in C#, memory is garbage-collected, and the entire source is compiled to an intermediate language instead of native machine instructions.
However, along with its intuitive UI designer, .NET is often the tool of choice for Windows developers to quickly create graphical applications.
Does that mean we can just drop C++ and go with C# and .NET for all our tasks?
Hell no!</p>

<p>While compiled .NET executables are lightweight enough to fulfill that constraint, they always depend on the heavyweight .NET Framework.
And here comes the culprit:
Different Windows versions ship with different .NET Framework versions preinstalled, and the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies">compatibility matrix</a> isn’t that easy.<br>
You want to target Windows 7?
Then your application needs to be written for .NET Framework 3.5, which is the only version that comes with Windows 7.
But keep in mind that your app won’t run under Windows 8 or 10 out of the box, which only ship with .NET Framework 4.x.
Yes, you read that right, .NET Framework 4.x won’t run applications written for .NET Framework 3.5.<br>
You are also screwed if you jumped on the train too early:
.NET Framework 1.x and all applications written for it are no longer supported starting with Windows 7.<br>
And if you still need to target out-of-the-box Windows XP installations, .NET Framework is no solution for you at all, because it doesn’t come preinstalled on XP.</p>

<p>Of course, the situation is different if you develop around a .NET Framework version that works on all your target platforms and always ship its installation package along with your application.
But then your software can no longer be considered lightweight or self-contained.
It may even require an installation with administrative rights on the target computer, which is the last thing we want here.</p>

<p>The experts among you may come and tell me:
Hey, there is a new kid in town.<br>
It’s called <em>.NET Core</em> and <em>.NET Native</em> and supports compiling C# code to native executables without any external framework dependencies!<br>
That’s right and I’m pretty sure it has a bright future.
However, it only targets Windows 10, which makes it no option if you need to support older Windows versions.</p>

<h2 id="recent-attempts">Recent attempts</h2>

<p>Since the release of Windows 8 in 2012, Microsoft has been trying to move people away from Win32 and came up with a variety of new frameworks:
<em>WinRT</em>, <em>UWP</em>, <em>WinJS</em>, <em>ReactXP</em>, and more recently <em>WinUI</em>.<br>
So far, none of this has proven to be a long-time safe bet.
WinJS confirms these fears, having already been abandoned after just 4 years.
And yet another time, all of these frameworks are no options if your application needs to run under Windows 7 or earlier.</p>



<p>As you see, nothing beats the backward and forward compatibility as well as the size of an application developed using only Win32 API.
Some lightweight C++ frameworks exist though, which wrap nicely around Win32 APIs and help us in situations where a pure C interface would be unnecessarily difficult to use.</p>

<p>Win32 is an integral part of the Windows operating system, which is not going to disappear tomorrow.
Due to the large reliance of components like .NET Framework on Win32, it is also unlikely that it ever will.
And as long as Windows system applications like Explorer and huge codebases like Microsoft Office are based around Win32, it is still a safe bet for writing new applications.</p>

<p>In the next posts, I am going to write a small DPI-aware wizard-style application using modern C++ features and Win32 API.
Making your application look properly on today’s high-resolution screens is one of the most neglected aspects in Win32 development.
I will also present some useful C++ wrappers along the way.</p>

<p>Welcome to the first part of the series of posts where I will guide you through the steps for creating a modern web application in Python and deploying it to the cloud using Elastic Beanstalk. By the end of this article, you will have a “Hello World” application available on the internet.</p>



<p>Pre-requisites </p>



<ul><li>Basic Python knowledge.</li></ul>



<h3>What is this blog post series about?</h3>



<p>You’ll find this series interesting if you want to create an app in Python that other people on the internet can use. This is actually not as trivial as it may seem. There is a lot of stuff you need to do. If you’ve never deployed a production-grade web application, I strongly suggest you read this series in the consecutive order starting with this post. If you’re an experienced engineer, feel free to review the table of contents and jump to the post that interests you the most.</p>



<h3>All posts in this series</h3>



<ul><li><a href="https://blog.seamlesscloud.io/2020/07/how-to-deploy-a-python-flask-app-to-aws-elastic-beanstalk/">Part 1: How to deploy a Python Flask app to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.seamlesscloud.io/2020/07/automated-deployment-to-aws-elastic-beanstalk-using-github-actions/">Part 2: Automated deployment to AWS Elastic Beanstalk using Github Actions.</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.seamlesscloud.io/2020/07/aws-elastic-beanstalk-infrastructure-in-code-with-terraform/">Part 3: AWS Elastic Beanstalk infrastructure in code with Terraform.</a></li><li>Part 4: In progress…</li></ul>



<p>Let’s jump right into it!</p>



<h2>Basic Flask Application</h2>



<p>Before we make our application available on the internet, let’s make sure we have it working locally. For the purposes of this article, we will need a simple web application, and the simplest way to make it in Python is&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flask</a>. If you don’t have it installed, please follow the instructions in their&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/" rel="noreferrer noopener">documentation</a>.</p>



<p>For the purposes of this tutorial, we don’t really need a fancy application, a simple “Hello World” would do. Let’s just copy and paste a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#a-minimal-application">Minimal Flask Application code</a>. Let’s create a file `application.py` and put the following code into it:</p>



<pre><code>from flask import Flask
application = Flask(__name__)


@application.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'</code></pre>



<div><p>Important!</p><p>Please note that the instance of Flask object is called `application` instead of `app` as in Flask documentation. This is actually important for the next step in this article. The default setting of AWS Elastic Beanstalk is to look into the file named `application.py` for the `application` variable. You can override this behavior later if you want.</p></div>



<p>Now you need to run the following in your terminal:</p>



<pre><code>export FLASK_APP=application.py &amp;&amp; flask run</code></pre>



<p>To check that it worked, please open the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/">http://127.0.0.1:5000/</a>&nbsp;URL in your browser. You should see this:</p>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-2.30.31-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>That’s not the next big thing in the web applications world, but this is enough for us at the moment. Let’s deploy it somewhere, so it’s not just on our local machine.</p>



<h2>AWS Elastic Beanstalk</h2>



<p>There are hundreds of different services to host your application. AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a decent choice for the following reasons:</p>



<ol><li>AWS infrastructure has everything in the world. You can probably spend your whole life learning all their services. As you develop your application, you may have different needs at different times, and chances are high AWS already can satisfy them.</li><li>Easy to get started. I will prove it by the end of this tutorial.</li><li>Scalable. We will get more into scalability later in this blog post series.</li></ol>



<h3>Setting up an account in AWS</h3>



<p>First things first, let’s create an account in AWS. You can do it here -&gt;&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://aws.amazon.com/free/</a>. If you already have an account in AWS – that’s awesome, you can use it.</p>



<div><p>Important!</p><p>If you’re new to AWS, you’ll get access to a free tier account for the first year. But you need to enter your credit card information to create an account. Throughout this tutorial, we’re going to use mostly free resources. However, I cannot guarantee that at the time you’re reading this article, AWS pricing is the same. Please be careful with settings in AWS and pay attention to the services you enable.</p></div>



<h3>Creating your first Elastic Beanstalk Application</h3>



<p>Now, let’s sign-in into the AWS console -&gt;&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/console/">https://aws.amazon.com/console/</a>. At the top left corner of the screen, click on “Services,” type “Elastic Beanstalk” in the search bar, and click on the first result.</p>

<p>Now click “Create Application.”</p>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-2.10.03-PM-1024x281.png" alt="" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-2.10.03-PM-1024x281.png 1024w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-2.10.03-PM-300x82.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-2.10.03-PM-768x211.png 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-2.10.03-PM-1536x422.png 1536w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-2.10.03-PM.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>You should see a page with basic settings for your application. We only need to pick an application name and to choose a platform. In the last section (“Application code”), let’s select the option “Upload your code”. This is how my page looks so far.</p>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/screencapture-console-aws-amazon-elasticbeanstalk-home-2020-07-21-14_14_26-1024x1003.png" alt="" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/screencapture-console-aws-amazon-elasticbeanstalk-home-2020-07-21-14_14_26-1024x1003.png 1024w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/screencapture-console-aws-amazon-elasticbeanstalk-home-2020-07-21-14_14_26-300x294.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/screencapture-console-aws-amazon-elasticbeanstalk-home-2020-07-21-14_14_26-768x752.png 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/screencapture-console-aws-amazon-elasticbeanstalk-home-2020-07-21-14_14_26-1536x1504.png 1536w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/screencapture-console-aws-amazon-elasticbeanstalk-home-2020-07-21-14_14_26.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The only thing left is to upload our python code. So, we will do it manually right now, but later in the series, you’ll get to know how to automate your deployment pipeline. For now, let’s go to our python code and create a zip archive.</p>

I remember the first time I built user preferences into an app. At first, users just needed to be able to opt in or out of our weekly emails. "No big deal," I thought, "I'll just add a new field on the Users table." For a while, that was fine. A few weeks later, my boss asked me if we could let users opt into push notifications. Fine, that's just one more column on the database. Can't hurt, right?</p>
<p>You probably see where this is going.</p>
<p>Within months, my user table had 40 columns, and while <a href="https://nerderati.com/2017/01/03/postgresql-tables-can-have-at-most-1600-columns/">Postgres can handle it</a>, it gets pretty tricky for new devs to keep up with all of them. You can imagine it looked pretty similar to this settings screen of Quora.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Postgres provides rich support for <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html">JSON fields</a>, which can be very handy in situations like mine. Both JSON data types (<code>json</code> and <code>jsonb</code>) allow you to store entire objects or lists directly in your database. This means that you can store any number of user preferences in one column.</p>

<h2 id="why-two-types-of-json-fields"><a href="#why-two-types-of-json-fields" aria-label="why two types of json fields permalink"></a>Why two types of JSON fields?</h2>
<p>JSON support in Postgres gives you the flexibility of a document store database like <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">Mongo</a> with the speed and structure of a relational database. JSON support is powerful, but because it comes in two types (<code>json</code> and <code>jsonb</code>), it's helpful to understand which is the right choice for your application.
The <code>json</code> data type was <a href="https://datavirtuality.com/blog-json-in-postgresql/">added in Postgres 9.2</a> and enhanced in 9.3. This new data type allowed you to store <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a> directly in your database and even query it. The problem was that <code>json</code> data was stored as a special kind of <code>text</code> field, so it was slow to query.</p>
<p>Postgres <a href="https://www.compose.com/articles/faster-operations-with-the-jsonb-data-type-in-postgresql/">introduced <code>jsonb</code> in 9.4</a> to combat this issue. Unlike <code>json</code> fields, <code>jsonb</code> fields are stored in a <strong>binary structure</strong> rather than text strings. While this means that writes are slightly slower, querying from <code>jsonb</code> fields is significantly faster. It also allows you to index <code>jsonb</code> fields. This makes <code>jsonb</code> the preferred format for most JSON data stored in Postgres, and the typical choice for Django applications.</p>
<h2 id="querying-jsonb-data-in-postgres"><a href="#querying-jsonb-data-in-postgres" aria-label="querying jsonb data in postgres permalink"></a>Querying JSONB data in Postgres</h2>
<p>The query syntax for accessing JSON in Postgres is not typical SQL. You have to use the specific <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html">JSON operators and functions</a>, so queries on JSON data look different from other Postgres queries.</p>
<p>For example, if you stored the following data in a Postgres table called <code>profiles</code>:</p>

























<table><thead><tr><th>id</th><th>name</th><th>preferences</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td><code>Mike</code></td><td><code>{"sms": false, "daily_email": true, "weekly_email": true}</code></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><code>Lucy</code></td><td><code>{"sms": true, "daily_email": false, "weekly_email": false}</code></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><code>Harriet</code></td><td><code>{"sms": true, "daily_email": true, "weekly_email": true}</code></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>And you wanted to query all users who have opted into your <code>daily_email</code>, you'd write a query like this:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> profiles
<span>where</span> <span>(</span>preferences<span>-</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>'daily_email'</span><span>)</span>::<span>boolean</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Which would give you back the rows for <code>Mike</code> and <code>Harriet</code>.
I'm pretty good with SQL, but using JSON operators always slows me down. Fortunately, Django offers support for JSONB fields, so you don't have to become an expert at querying JSON in Postgres.</p>
<h2 id="django-support-for-jsonb"><a href="#django-support-for-jsonb" aria-label="django support for jsonb permalink"></a>Django support for JSONB</h2>
<p>Since Django 1.9, the popular Python framework has supported <code>jsonb</code> and <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/contrib/postgres/fields">several other Postgres-specific fields</a>. Native Django support means that creating <code>jsonb</code> fields, using them in your models, inserting data into them, and querying from them are all possible with Django's ORM. Let's take a look at how you can get started using <code>jsonb</code> with Django.</p>
<h3 id="creating-jsonb-fields-using-migrations"><a href="#creating-jsonb-fields-using-migrations" aria-label="creating jsonb fields using migrations permalink"></a>Creating JSONB fields using migrations</h3>
<p>Django's Postgres module comes with several field classes that you can import and add to your models. If you want to use a JSON field, import the <code>JSONField</code> class and use it for your model's property. In this example, we'll call the field <code>preferences</code>:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> django<span>.</span>db <span>import</span> models
<span>from</span> django<span>.</span>contrib<span>.</span>postgres<span>.</span>fields <span>import</span> JSONField
 
<span>class</span> <span>Profile</span><span>(</span>models<span>.</span>Model<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    name <span>=</span> models<span>.</span>CharField<span>(</span>max_length<span>=</span><span>200</span><span>)</span>
    preferences <span>=</span> JSONField<span>(</span><span>)</span>
 
    <span>def</span> <span>__str__</span><span>(</span>self<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> self<span>.</span>name</code></pre></div>
<p>Django only supports the <code>jsonb</code> column type, so when you run your migrations, Django will create a table definition like this:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>table</span> app_profile
<span>(</span>
    id <span>serial</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span> <span>constraint</span> app_profile_pkey <span>primary</span> <span>key</span><span>,</span>
    name <span>varchar</span><span>(</span><span>200</span><span>)</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span>
    preferences jsonb <span>not</span> <span>null</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="adding-data-to-jsonb-fields"><a href="#adding-data-to-jsonb-fields" aria-label="adding data to jsonb fields permalink"></a>Adding data to JSONB fields</h3>
<p>Because JSON fields don't enforce a particular schema, Django will convert any valid Python data type (dictionary, list, string, number, boolean) into the appropriate JSON. For example, if you want to add a new row to the <code>app_profile</code> table created above, you can run the following in your Django application:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> app<span>.</span>models <span>import</span> Profile
 

p <span>=</span> Profile<span>(</span>name<span>=</span><span>"Tanner"</span><span>,</span> preferences<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>'sms'</span><span>:</span> <span>False</span><span>,</span> <span>'daily_email'</span><span>:</span> <span>True</span><span>,</span> <span>'weekly_email'</span><span>:</span> <span>True</span><span>}</span><span>)</span>
p<span>.</span>save<span>(</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will create a new user named <code>Tanner</code> who will receive our <code>daily_email</code> and <code>weekly_email</code>, but no <code>sms</code> messages.</p>
<h3 id="querying-jsonb-fields"><a href="#querying-jsonb-fields" aria-label="querying jsonb fields permalink"></a>Querying JSONB fields</h3>
<p>Django uses the double underscore pattern from <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/db/queries/#field-lookups">field lookups</a> to query JSON object keys. For example, if you want to get all the Profiles for users who have opted into our <code>daily_email</code>, you'd use the following code:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>results <span>=</span> Profile<span>.</span>objects<span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span>preferences__daily_email<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you want to check the SQL query that Django runs, you can print it from the <code>query</code> property on the results object:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>print</span><span>(</span>results<span>.</span>query<span>)</span>

SELECT <span>"app_profile"</span><span>.</span><span>"id"</span><span>,</span> <span>"app_profile"</span><span>.</span><span>"name"</span><span>,</span> <span>"app_profile"</span><span>.</span><span>"preferences"</span> 
FROM <span>"app_profile"</span> WHERE <span>(</span><span>"app_profile"</span><span>.</span><span>"preferences"</span> <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> daily_email<span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>'true'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, the query is slightly different from the one I manually wrote above (I cast <code>daily_email</code> to a <code>boolean</code>), but it accomplishes the same thing.
You can also filter records based on the keys they contain. For example, if some user accounts were created before you added the <code>sms</code> option, you might want to find them and let the users know about the new option. You can use the <code>isnull</code> field lookup on the <code>sms</code> key in your JSON data:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>results <span>=</span> Profile<span>.</span>objects<span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span>preferences__sms__isnull<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are many other ways to filter queries using JSON fields, so be sure to <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/contrib/postgres/fields/#querying-jsonfield">check out the official Django docs for more</a>.</p>
<h2 id="limitations-of-jsonb-fields"><a href="#limitations-of-jsonb-fields" aria-label="limitations of jsonb fields permalink"></a>Limitations of JSONB fields</h2>
<p>It's worth noting that <code>jsonb</code> fields come with some drawbacks. I've already mentioned that it takes slightly longer to write data to <code>jsonb</code> fields than <code>json</code> because the JSON string must be converted to binary, but there are other reasons to avoid <code>jsonb</code> fields.</p>
<p>First, if your data needs to enforce a strict schema, JSON may not be an ideal choice. While you <a href="https://blog.hagander.net/json-field-constraints-228/">can use check constraints</a> to enforce the use of specific fields, this isn't natively supported in Django, so you'll need to write your own migrations to accomplish this.</p>
<p>A better way to address this shortcoming is by writing Django validation rules to enforce the structure you want. If you don't want to write the validation rules yourself, there's a popular package called <a href="https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"><code>jsonschema</code></a> that I'd recommend.</p>
<p>Another drawback to using JSON fields is handling changes to the shape of your data. If you want to add a new column to a database table in Postgres using Django, you simply update your model and run a migration. If you want to add a new field to a JSON column, it isn't quite as straightforward.</p>
<p>A pattern I've used before is to create a custom migration that loops through the affected records and updates each one individually. This naive method works for relatively small datasets, but it might not be a good idea if you need to update 1 million profiles in a production database. In that case, it might be better to write your code to handle the existence or absence of the key or run a <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-update-objects-inside-jsonb-arrays-with-postgresql-5c4e03be256a/">batch update on the JSON object</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While JSON data types come with some drawbacks, they are useful in situations where you need more flexibility in your data structure. Thanks to Django's native support for <code>jsonb</code>, you can get started using JSON data in your web applications without learning all the native Postgres query operators. </p>
<p>Next time you need more flexibility in your data model and want to benefit from the strengths of Postgres give <code>jsonb</code> fields a try.</p>

    <p>Say you want to display the contents of a file on the command line. The first tool we most of us reach for is <code>cat</code>, which does a fine job at just this.
But what happens when you are on a Linux machine and when you try to cat a file this happens:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ cat file.txt
-bash: cat: command not found
</code></pre></div><p>or even:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ cat file.txt
bash: fork: retry: No child processes
</code></pre></div><p>This post explores this idea and was a feature of this <a href="https://oops.cmdchallenge.com/#/oops_print_file_contents">challenge</a> where you needed to display a file’s contents without using any utility outside of the shell.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="using-shell-built-ins-redirection-and-subshell">Using shell built-ins, redirection and subshell</h2>
<p>Using the shell builtin <code>read</code> you can display the contents of a file, without a forking a new process:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>while</span> read line; <span>do</span>
  echo $line;
<span>done</span> &lt;file.txt
</code></pre></div><p>From the help page for <code>read</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One line is read from the standard input, or from file descriptor FD if the -u option is supplied, and the first word is assigned to the first NAME,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this example, the contents of file.txt are redirected to the STDIN of <code>read</code>, which processes the input line by line, until it reaches the end of the file. <code>read</code> also can take a file descriptor as its input instead of STDIN, so this will also work:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">exec 3&lt;file.txt <span># Assign file descriptor 3 for reading</span>
<span>while</span> read -u <span>3</span> line; <span>do</span>
  echo $line
<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This ends up being a lot more typing than just <code>cat file.txt</code>. With the <code>bash</code> or <code>zsh</code> there is a another way to display a file’s contents without using <code>cat</code>:</p>
<p>this method uses redirection and command substitution, and is mentioned in the bash man page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The command substitution $(cat file) can be replaced by the equivalent but faster $(&lt; file).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s faster, because you are not forking a cat, but does it matter? Probably not, and may not be clear to everyone what you are doing, but you can see a difference with a quick test on your shell:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ time <span>for</span> n in <span>{</span>1..1000<span>}</span>; <span>do</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>    echo <span>$(</span>&lt;/etc/resolv.conf<span>)</span> &gt;/dev/null; <span>\
</span><span></span>  <span>done</span>

real	0m0.977s
user	0m0.380s
sys	0m0.604s
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ time <span>for</span> n in <span>{</span>1..1000<span>}</span>; <span>do</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>    cat /etc/resolv.conf &gt;/dev/null;
  <span>done</span>

real	0m1.980s
user	0m0.626s
sys	0m1.224s
</code></pre></div><p>This syntax <code>$(&lt;file.text)</code> may look a bit strange, what you are doing is command substitution, where the contents of <code>file.txt</code> are sent to STDIN which is then echo’d as STDOUT. If you want to learn a bit more about redirection using <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;</code> see my earlier post about <a href="https://jarv.org/posts/cat-without-cat/posts/shell-redirection/">shell redirection</a>.</p>
<h2 id="using-other-utilities">Using other utilities</h2>
<p>How about other options? Without using shell built-ins but instead using other standard utilities you can also cat without cat:</p>
<p><code>ul</code> might inadvertently underline some words in your file but I think it might be the only way to cat a file with only two characters.</p>
<p>If you didn’t already guess, <code>tac</code> is GNU core util that is the reverse of <code>cat</code> so if you want to be clever you can pipe the output of <code>tac</code> to <code>tac</code> which is just a <code>cat</code>.</p>
<p>Of course using tools like <code>sed</code>, <code>perl</code>, <code>python</code>, etc. will allow you to cat files as well, happy cat’ing!</p>

      <p>Can you spot the problem with this piece of code?</p>
      <pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> members <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> nonMembers <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> members<span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>nonMembers<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>Take a minute to look. Code just like this probably exists in more JavaScript codebases
        than not. Sometimes it flies right under the nose of people who know better,
        myself included. In fact a case where I made this mistake was what prompted me
        to write this post in the first place.</p>
      <p>I'll give you a hint. Here's what it looks like without async/await syntax:</p>
      <pre><code><span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>members</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>nonMembers</span> <span>=&gt;</span> members<span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>nonMembers<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>Do you see it now? It was actually tricky to even write this version, because
        this mistake is so hard to make <em>without</em> async/await.</p>
      <p>Here's what the above looks like in the network log:
        <img src="https://www.brandonsmith.ninja/img/blog/async-await/staggered.png" alt="Staggered waterfall"></p>
      <p>We've taken two independent, asynchronous tasks, and put them into a <strong>sequence</strong>.
        This function takes twice as long as it needs to.</p>
      <p>Here's what it should be:</p>
      <pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> members <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> nonMembers <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> both <span>=</span> <span>await</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span> members<span>,</span> nonMembers <span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> both<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>both<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>Or, without async/await:</p>
      <pre><code><span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> members <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> nonMembers <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span> members<span>,</span> nonMembers <span>]</span><span>)</span>
          <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>both</span> <span>=&gt;</span> both<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>both<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>And here's what that looks like:
        <img src="https://www.brandonsmith.ninja/img/blog/async-await/parallel.png" alt="Parallel waterfall"></p>
      <h2 id="easy-mistakes">Easy mistakes </h2>
      <p>Take note how much more complicated the "bad" version was when written as plain
        promises. The Promises API encourages parallelism, and gets clunky when you need to put
        things in sequence. Async/await largely arose as a solution for when you <em>do</em>
        need things to happen in sequence, like when you need to feed the output of one
        request into the next as a parameter. And it does arguably make both cases at
        least a little cleaner. But importantly, it inverts them, making <strong>the
sequential flow easier than the parallel flow</strong>.</p>
      <p>Even if you understand the Promises code that the syntax ends up translating to, it's
        easy to fall into this trap. If you <em>don't</em> already understand Promises and
        what exactly async/await is really doing, even more so.</p>
      <p>I wouldn't go so far as to say that async/await are "bad" (or perhaps,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Considered_harmful">"considered harmful"</a>).
        Especially in languages that don't have a reasonable API like Promises, or do
        have other restrictions around closures that make them less trivial to use,
        async/await can make code much more readable overall.</p>
      <p>But they do come with a pretty large pitfall. Both the strength and the weakness of
        the syntax is that it allows us to take asynchronous things and pretend they're
        sequential again. Our brains have an easier time reasoning about sequential
        processes.</p>
      <p>But I think it's a shame that the easiest and clearest way to write
        something with async/await is, more often than not, wrong. And wrong in a subtle
        way that may never be noticed, because it only affects performance, not
        correctness.</p>
      <p>I'm a big believer in languages and libraries that make it easy to do the
        thing that's usually right, and hard to do the thing that's usually wrong. That
        said, I don't have a proposal for how async/await could have been done
        differently. I just regret the way things turned out.</p>
      <p>But at the very least, I think it's increasingly important - as more and more
        languages adopt this syntax - that people are aware of how it can easily be
        misused.</p>
      <h2 id="mitigating-the-problem">Mitigating the problem </h2>
      <p>If you're ever not sure how your code is behaving, look at the
        waterfall graph and see if you might have an easy opportunity to make your
        application much faster.</p>
      <p>You can also use this rule of thumb: If an <code>await</code>ed
        function call doesn't use the result from another <code>await</code>ed function call (or
        something derived from the result), you should use <code>Promise.all()</code> to make
        them happen at the same time.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Credit card users today can transact online with peace of mind because card-accepting merchants are subject to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). PCI DSS was established in 2006 by a consortium of credit card companies to combat online fraud. <a href="#1">[1]</a> It sets exacting requirements on how merchants store, process, and transmit credit card data. <a href="#2">[2]</a> Merchants that don’t comply risk getting fined or even outright banned from the card networks.</p><p>Security is also a concern for bank payments. If anything, bank account numbers are even more sensitive than credit card numbers because they don’t change. In this post, we’ll examine the impact of ACH payment fraud, describe upcoming compliance requirements, and share what we consider to be security best practices.</p></div><h5>Sizing Bank Payments Fraud</h5><p>Before diving into a solution, it's worth assessing the fraud problem. After all, bank transfers have historically been perceived as the most secure payment method. A Federal Reserve study found that ACH payments in 2015 had the lowest fraud rate of all US payment methods at 0.0008%. <a href="#4">[4]</a> That works out to just 8 fraudulent cents for every $10,000 moved.<br></p><p>However, a deeper look reveals how that perception is challenged as bank payments volume moves online. The most recent figures show ACH volume on the internet grew to $2.9 trillion in 2018 up 14.2% from the prior year. <a href="#5">[5]</a> That same year, ACH was the only payment method to see an increase in fraud rates, according to research from the Association of Financial Professionals. <a href="#6">[6]</a> The percentage of surveyed organizations that encountered ACH credit fraud spiked to 20%, up from 7% a year prior. 33% of the surveyed organizations had encountered ACH debit fraud, up from 28% a year prior.</p><p>So ACH fraud has risen sharply in recent years. What security rules are in place to combat this?</p><h5>The NACHA Response</h5><p>The closest analogue to PCI DSS is the ACH Security Framework Rule introduced in 2013 by NACHA, the ACH network’s governing body. In a nutshell, the rule requires ACH network participants to “protect the confidentiality and integrity of [non-public personal information] until its destruction.” <a href="#7">[7]</a> Compliance is verified through an annual audit conducted by your Depository Financial Institution (DFI).</p><p>Large-scale ACH originators should know about an upcoming amendment to these rules that will require every non-DFI ACH originator, third-party sender, and <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/the-difference-between-a-third-party-sender-and-a-third-party-service-provider-in-payments" target="_blank">third-party service provider</a> to render bank account numbers unreadable when stored electronically.<a href="#8">[8]</a> Its enforcement dates are staggered by transaction count:</p><ul role="list"><li>Entities with more than 6 million ACH payments annually must comply by June 30, 2021.</li><li>Entities with more than 2 million ACH payments annually must comply by June 30, 2022.</li></ul><p>A couple things to note here. Firstly, with the history of PCI DSS as a guide, we predict that eventually <em>all</em> ACH participants will be required to obfuscate bank account information. Secondly, NACHA intentionally doesn’t mandate any particular data security methods or techniques. We have a few recommendations.</p><p>‍<br></p><h5>Security Best Practices</h5><p>Securing bank account information should be a foremost priority even if NACHA doesn’t prescribe how. We at Modern Treasury consider the following practices to be table stakes for businesses that accept bank payments:</p><ul role="list"><li>Use AES 256 encryption for data at rest and TLS to protect the contents of data in transit. Create a process with your team to rotate keys every 90 days.</li><li>Run internal and external vulnerability scans at least quarterly. Work with certified vendors to detect whether your systems are subject to known vulnerabilities.</li><li>Implement role-based access controls to limit which of your internal users can see sensitive information. Keeping permissions on a need-to-know basis minimizes the attack surface of your system.</li><li>Keep an audit trail of your internal users’ read and write actions. Here’s an <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/audit-logs" target="_blank">example</a> of the one we shipped.</li><li>Choose <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/how-to-get-a-soc-2" target="_blank">SOC 2</a> compliant vendors. Any data breach that your external vendor suffers is a data breach that your business suffers. You can minimize that risk by requiring your vendors to pass the technical audit of their security practices.</li></ul><p>‍</p><h5>One More Thing</h5><p>Here we’ve shared some thoughts on keeping bank account numbers out of the hands of attackers. Another thing to consider is whether you are paying and charging the right bank accounts in the first place. This is why bank account validation is so important. You should know who is taking custody of the funds you’re sending. NACHA is implementing an account validation rule that requires merchants to validate first-use consumer accounts, effective March 23, 2021. <a href="#9">[9]</a> Accepted account validation methods include:</p><ul role="list"><li>ACH prenotification</li><li>ACH micro-transaction verification</li><li>Third party validation services, e.g. Plaid</li></ul><p>‍</p><h5>Conclusion</h5><div><p>Sending bank payments securely can be daunting. One option to accept bank payments while reducing your data security burden is to work with a provider like Modern Treasury. We can help you integrate with your bank securely and scale your business’ payment operations.

									<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: It gives your seed investors a level of extreme anti-dilution protection that is virtually unheard of in startup finance, making it worse than seed equity and conventional convertible notes in terms of economics for most seed stage companies. There are far better, more balanced ways to “clarify” ownership for seed investors without forcing founders and employees to absorb additional dilution risk.</p>
<p>Related Reading: TechCrunch:</p>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/19/why-convertible-notes-are-safer-than-safes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why convertible notes are safer than SAFEs.&nbsp;</a></li>
<li><a href="https://siliconhillslawyer.com/2020/01/03/race-to-the-bottom-startup-lawyers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Race to the Bottom in Startup Law</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A regular underlying theme you’ll read on SHL is that key players in the startup community are incredibly talented at taking a viewpoint that is clearly (to experienced players) investor-biased, but spinning / marketing it as somehow “startup friendly.”&nbsp; And lawyers <a href="https://siliconhillslawyer.com/2017/01/01/avoid-captive-company-counsel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">captive to the interests of investors</a> are always happy to play along, knowing that inexperienced teams can be easily duped.</p>
<p>One example is how “moving fast” in startup financing negotiations is always a good thing for entrepreneurs. Investors are diversified, wealthy, and 100x as experienced as founders in deal terms and economics, but it’s somehow in the <em>founders’</em> interest to sign whatever template the investor puts on the table, instead of actually reviewing, negotiating, and processing the long-term implications? Right. Thanks for the awesome insight, champ.</p>
<p>Y Combinator’s move to have its SAFEs convert on a post-money, instead of pre-money, basis is another great example. Their argument is that it helps “clarify” how the SAFEs will convert on the cap table. Clarity is great, right? Who can argue with clarity?</p>
<p>What’s not emphasized prominently enough is that the way they delivered that “clarity” is by implementing anti-dilution protection for SAFE investors (like themselves) that is more aggressive than anything remotely “standard” in the industry; and that wasn’t necessary at all to provide “clarity.” <strong>Under YC’s new SAFE, the common stock absorbs <span>all</span> dilution from any subsequent SAFE or convertible note rounds until an equity round, while SAFE holders are fully protected from that dilution. That is <span>crazy</span>.</strong> It’s the equivalent of “full ratchet” anti-dilution, which has become almost non-existent in startup finance because of how company unfriendly it is. In fact, it’s&nbsp;<em>worse</em> than full ratchet because in a typical anti-dilution context it only triggers if the valuation is lower. In this case, SAFE holders get fully protected for convertible dilution even if the valuation cap is <em>higher</em>. It’s a cap table grab that in a significant number of contexts won’t be made up for by other more minor changes to the SAFE (around pro-rata rights and option pool treatment) if a company ends up doing multiple convertible rounds.</p>
<p>When you’re raising your initial seed money, you have absolutely no idea what the future might hold. <strong>The notion that you can predict at your initial SAFE closing whether you’ll be able to raise an equity round as your next funding (in order to convert your SAFEs), or instead need another convertible round (in which case your SAFE holders are fully protected from dilution), is absurd. Honest advisors and investors will admit it.</strong> Given the dynamics of most seed stage startups, YC’s post-money SAFE therefore offers the <span>worst</span> economics (for companies) of all seed funding structures. Founders should instead opt for a structure that doesn’t penalize them, with dilution, for being unable to predict the future.</p>
<p>Yes, YC’s original (pre-money) SAFE has contributed to a problem for many SAFE investors, but that problem is the result of an imbalanced lack of accountability in the original SAFE structure; not a need to re-do conversion economics. As mentioned in the above TechCrunch article, the reason convertible notes are still the dominant convertible seed instrument across the country is that the maturity date in a convertible note serves as a valuable “accountability” mechanism in a seed financing. A 2-3 year maturity gives founders a sense of urgency to get to a conversion event, or at least stay in communication with investors about their financing plans. By eliminating maturity, SAFEs enabled a culture of runaway serial seed financings constantly delaying conversion, creating significant uncertainty for seed investors.</p>
<p><strong>YC now wants to “fix” the problem they themselves enabled, but the “solution” goes too far in the opposite direction by requiring the common stock (founders and early employees) to absorb an inordinate amount of dilution risk.</strong> If “clarity” around conversion economics is <em>really</em> the concern of seed investors, there are already several far more balanced options for delivering that clarity:</p>
<p><span><strong>Seed Equity</strong></span> – Series Seed templates already exist that are dramatically more streamlined than full Series A docs, but solidify ownership for seed investors on Day 1, with <em>normal</em> weighted average (not full ratchet) anti-dilution. 100% clarity on ownership. Closing a seed equity deal is usually a quarter to a third of the cost of a Series A, because the docs are simpler. Seed equity is an under-appreciated way to align the common stock and seed investors in terms of post-funding dilution. Yes, it takes a bit more time than just signing a template SAFE, but it’s an increasingly popular option both among entrepreneurs (because it reduces dilution) and investors (because it provides certainty); and for good reason.</p>
<p><span><strong>Harden the denominator</strong></span> – Another option I’ve mentioned before in <a href="https://siliconhillslawyer.com/2017/03/04/notes-safes-extra-dilutive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Notes and SAFEs are Extra Dilutive</a> is to simply “harden” the denominator (the capitalization) that will be used for conversion on Day 1, while letting the valuation float (typically capped). This ensures <em>everyone</em> (common and investors) are diluted by subsequent investors, just like an equity round, while allowing you to easily model conversion at a valuation cap from Day 1. <strong>If the <em>real</em> motivation for the SAFE changes was in fact the ability to more easily model SAFE ownership on the cap table – instead of shifting economics in favor of investors – this (hardening the conversion denominator) would’ve been a far more logical approach than building significant anti-dilution mechanisms into the valuation cap.</strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Add a Maturity Date</strong></span> – Again, the reason why, outside of Silicon Valley, so many seed investors balk at the SAFE structure altogether is because of the complete lack of accountability mechanisms it contains. No voting rights or board seat. No maturity date. Just hand over your money, and hope for the best. I don’t represent a single tech investor – all companies – and yet I agree that SAFEs created more problems than they solved. Convertible notes with reasonable maturity dates (2-3 years) are a simple way for investors and entrepreneurs to get aligned on seed fundraising plans, and if after an initial seed round the company needs to raise a second seed and extend maturity, it forces a valuable conversation with investors so everyone can get aligned.</p>
<p>Conventional convertible notes – which are far more of an (air quotes) “standard” across the country than any SAFE structure – don’t protect the noteholders from all dilution that happens before an equity round. That leaves flexibility for additional note fundraising (which very often happens, at improved valuations) before maturity, with the noteholders sharing in that dilution. If a client asks me whether they should take a low-interest capped convertible note with a 3-yr maturity v. a capped Post-Money SAFE for their first seed raise, my answer will be the convertible note. Every time, unless they are somehow 100% positive that their next raise is an equity round. The legal fees will be virtually identical.</p>
<p>Before anyone even tries to argue that signing YC’s template is nevertheless worth it because otherwise money is “wasted” on legal fees, let’s be crystal clear: <strong>the economics of the post-money SAFE can end up&nbsp;<span>so bad</span> for a startup that a material % of the cap table worth as much as 7-figures can shift over to the seed investors (relative to a different structure) if the company ends up doing additional convertible rounds after its original SAFE; which <span>very</span> often happens.</strong> Do the math.</p>
<p>The whole “you should mindlessly sign this template or OMG the legal fees!” argument is just one more example of the sleight-of-hand rhetoric peddled by very clever investors to dupe founders into penny wise, pound foolish decisions that end up lining an investor’s pocket. It can take only a few sentences, or even the deletion of a handful of words, to make the economics of a seed instrument more balanced. Smart entrepreneurs understand that experienced advisors can be extremely valuable (and efficient) “equalizers” in these sorts of negotiations.</p>
<p>When I first reviewed the new post-money SAFE, my reaction was: what on earth is YC doing? I had a similar reaction to YC’s so-called <a href="https://siliconhillslawyer.com/2019/03/03/standard-term-sheets-problem-yc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Standard” Series A Term Sheet</a>, which itself is far more investor friendly than the marketing conveys and should be rejected by entrepreneurs. Ironically, YC’s changes to the SAFE were purportedly driven by the need for “clarity,” and yet their recently released Series A term sheet leaves enormous control points vague and prone to gaming post-term sheet; providing far <em>less</em> clarity than a typical term sheet. The extra “clarity” in the Post-Money SAFE favors investors. The vagueness in the YC Series A term sheet also favors investors. I guess YC’s preference for clarity or vagueness rests on whether it benefits the money. Surprised? <span><strong>Entrepreneurs and employees (common stockholders) are going to get hurt by continuing to let investors unilaterally set their own so-called “standards.”</strong></span></p>
<p>One might argue that YC’s shift (as an accelerator and investor) from overly founder-biased to overly investor-biased docs parallels the natural pricing progression of a company that initially needed to subsidize adoption, but has now achieved market leverage. Low-ball pricing early to get traction (be very founder friendly), but once you’ve got the brand and market …</p></div></div>

<h2>1: Fiverr to Sell Your Services Online</h2>
<p>Finding a reliable and reputable website to sell your services as a freelancer on an international scale is key to a freelancers success.  Fiverr is free to sign up as a freelancer (they do charge a commission on each sale). They have over 300 categories, accommodating a wide range of services and professional skills and it requests freelancers to take online exams to prove their efficiency and professionalism.</p>
<p>Connecting professional freelancers with businesses around the globe, we would recommend Fiverr to anyone thinking about setting themselves up as a freelancer, whether it be full time or on a part time basis. Fiverr’s platform is really easy to navigate and as a freelancer you can create gigs which are basically the services you are offering to clients. This gives you creative control over how you promote yourself on the platform as well as set the prices you want to charge. Fiverr does take a percentage of the money you make though, so that’s important to bear in mind when pricing your gigs.</p>
<p>Sign up to <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fiverr here</a>.</p>

<h2>2: LinkedIn to Position Yourself as a Professional</h2>
<p>If you’ve set yourself up a free freelancer Fiverr profile, it’s time to maximise your online exposure. When it comes to social media marketing as a freelancer, LinkedIn is one of the best platforms to use. This professional social media platform allows you to position yourself as an industry expert and freelancer. You can even share a link to your Fiverr profile through LinkedIn, as well as the services you’re offering.</p>
<p>Another great way to use LinkedIn is to generate new clients and opportunities for yourself. Many businesses use LinkedIn to headhunt or to advertise job opportunities along with projects. As a freelancer, you can use LinkedIn’s job search feature and find freelance opportunities around the world. If you come across an ideal opportunity for your unique skill set and experience, but it is listed as an in-house role, we highly recommend contacting the company directly and ask them whether they’ve ever considered using a professional freelancer. If the company is local to you, consider setting up a meeting with them. Or if they’re far away, a virtual meeting via Skype or Zoom can help you secure an exciting new role. Be confident and don’t undervalue your experience and talent. Businesses are still getting used to the idea that freelancers can offer professional, high-quality services, so it might take time to convince a traditional company to broaden their horizons and benefit from the freelance world.</p>
<p>So, what are you waiting for, set yourself up a professional freelancer profile on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn now</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In my prior posts, we've talked about <a href="https://www.architect.io/blog/using-hashicorp-vault-to-enable-credential-cycling">how to instrument credential cycling</a> and
<a href="https://www.architect.io/blog/how-dynamic-credentialing-makes-apps-portable">why it's important to enable application portability</a>. In this post, we'll take
the notion of credential cycling even further and show how secrets can be
injected into volumes mounted to your applications. Injecting secrets into
mounted volumes is a great way to securely provide credentials to your
applications without forcing all your containers to cycle on every update.</p><h2 id="why-should-we-avoid-container-cycling"><a href="#why-should-we-avoid-container-cycling" aria-label="why should we avoid container cycling permalink"></a>Why should we avoid container cycling?</h2><p>In a cloud-native world, we're taught to invest heavily in our DevOps and
continuous delivery processes to ensure that applications can be deployed
automatically and frequently. This guarantees that new features can be
released to customers safely and quickly. Still,
deployments remain one of the most risky engineering processes and are all too
often the cause for production downtime or outages.
Even if we have a reliable release process, it's always best to avoid needless
use when possible. And since changes to application credentials don't change any
application code, updating credentials on the fly represents low-hanging fruit
for reducing the overall number of deployments.</p><p>There is another reason to avoid container cycling: deployment speed.
Shutting down and starting up any single container takes time; multiply
this by the number of replicas you have and suddenly you find
yourself monitoring a lengthy and risky process. Having applications
read in credentials from the filesystem allows them to more quickly
receive updates without needing to be cycled.</p><h2 id="reading-secrets-from-the-filesystem"><a href="#reading-secrets-from-the-filesystem" aria-label="reading secrets from the filesystem permalink"></a>Reading secrets from the filesystem</h2><p>The cornerstone of our approach to dynamic credentialing will be to read
secrets from volume mounts. So the first thing we'll need to do is to tell
our apps to read in secrets from the file system instead of from environment
variables.</p><p>In this example, we're going to load in credentials to a Postgres instance;
we'll assume that the secret is a JSON encoded string containing a <code>user</code>,
<code>password</code>, and <code>database</code> field:</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> fs <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'fs'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>}</span>

  <span>return</span> postgres_client<span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div><p>In the above snippet, we've created a method called <code>getPostgresClient()</code> that
will return a properly configured client for accessing our postgres database.
We've also set it up to cache the client and only generate a new one when the
previous credentials are considered stale. This will allow us to return the
client in a reasonably performant way without needing to read from the file
system on every request.</p><p>Next up we'll want to test out the integration! Let's go ahead and create a
simple method that will create a table, write to the database, read from the
database, and then tear it all down again.</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>testDBConnection</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> db <span>=</span> <span>getPostgresClient</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  db<span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  
  <span>await</span> db<span>.</span><span>query</span><span>(</span>
    <span>'CREATE TABLE users (id int, last_name varchar(255), first_name varchar(255))'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>await</span> db<span>.</span><span>query</span><span>(</span>
    <span>"INSERT INTO users (id, last_name, first_name) VALUES (1, 'User', 'Test')"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>

  
  <span>const</span> result <span>=</span> <span>await</span> db<span>.</span><span>query</span><span>(</span><span>'SELECT * FROM users'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>result<span>.</span>rows<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  
  <span>await</span> db<span>.</span><span>query</span><span>(</span><span>'DROP TABLE users'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>await</span> db<span>.</span><span>end</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>testDBConnection</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div><p>Great! Let's go ahead and write the two methods above into an <code>index.js</code> file and
create a <code>Dockerfile</code> to help us run it in a container. Don't forget to create a
<code>package.json</code> file for the project and install the <code>pg</code> library too.</p><div data-language="dockerfile"><pre><code><span>FROM</span> node<span>:</span>13
<span>WORKDIR</span> /usr/src/app

<span>COPY</span> package*.json ./
<span>RUN</span> npm install

<span>COPY</span> index.js .

<span>CMD</span> <span>[</span><span>"node"</span><span>,</span> <span>"index.js"</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div><p>Before we can properly run our image, we need to boot up a postgres
instance:</p><div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ docker run -d -p <span>5432</span>:5432 <span>\</span>
    -e <span>POSTGRES_USER</span><span>=</span>postgres <span>\</span>
    -e <span>POSTGRES_PASSWORD</span><span>=</span>password <span>\</span>
    -e <span>POSTGRES_DB</span><span>=</span>architect <span>\</span>
    postgres:11</code></pre></div><p>Time to boot up our application and see what happens! Let's build that Docker image and run
it locally!</p><div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ docker build -t credentials-test:latest <span>.</span>
$ docker run credentials-test:latest</code></pre></div><p>Whoop! Seems we haven't mounted the secret onto the container yet and we got a
nasty error. We'll need to write the credentials to a local file that we can then mount
to our application when we run it. Go ahead and copy the json credentials into a
file named, <code>database.json</code>:</p><div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"user"</span><span>:</span> <span>"postgres"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"password"</span><span>:</span> <span>"password"</span><span>,</span>

<h2>We don’t have all the answers, but we can start asking the right questions</h2>

</div>


<p>My twelve-year-old son was actually talking on the phone. For longer than one minute, and not to ask a gaming- or pc-related question to one of his uncles. Instead, he was having a relaxed and alightly giddy conversation with one of my closest and best friends. I took this shot with my son’s own phone, I thought it was an interesting moment.</p>

<p>And it reminded me.</p>

<p>I was visiting another friend the other day - one of these special people who, when you self-publish a book, takes the time and effort to order one for themselves. Awesome.</p>

<p>He introduced me to his kids - who I was meeting for the first time - as the writer of the book he had recently gotten, and said to his oldest daughter (I think she’s 9):</p>
<blockquote>

<p>“I think this might actually be an interesting book for you as well; it’s about screen-time and how much time we spend on digital devices.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This reminded me heavily of a conversation I had had with people in a workshop I had led back at a congress in November, where we talked about the silent impact digital technology has on our lives, and about my <a href="https://lifebeyond.one/products/life-beyond-the-touch-screen-smartphone-addiction" target="_blank" title="Book Life Beyond" rel="noopener noreferrer">book Life Beyond the Touch Screen.</a>
</p>

<p>One of the participants said she could really see the book - and especially the pages with bold printed quotes and questions - as a great conversation starter about the issues of smartphone addiction and other effects of technology overuse on our mental health.</p>

<p>Turns out; a lot of people thought the same.</p>

<p>Now, why is this so important?</p>

<p>
<h3>Your habits exist between you and your environment</h3>
</p>
<p>I once, for a brief period of time, worked for the organization that organizes “Family Group Conferences” in the Netherlands (De Eigen Kracht Centrale). Even though I studied psychology, one lesson about mental health care I learned at EKC like never before was this:</p>

<p>You can take the alcoholic out of his home environment, and put him in a rehab center and through all sorts of therapy, to then pronounce him cured.</p>

<p>However, what happens when you put him back at home, in his dysfunctional relationship with his spouse, with his group of friends in which toxic masculinity and alcohol abuse are the norms - and his house above the pub?</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p>Your habits are formed by your environment and if you’re human, chances are that next to physical, digital and - depending on your background metaphysical - your environment is determined in a large part by the nature, strength and depth of your relationships and social network.</p>

<p>It’s hard to change or create a new habit, but it’s exponentially harder to do so without changing your environment. Especially the social one.</p>

<p>Does that mean you automatically need a new spouse, new friends and a new location to live?</p>

<p>Of course not.</p>

<p>But it does mean you need to start the conversation.</p>

<p>
<h3>Starting the conversation and the steps after that</h3>
</p>
<p>Now, if you’re interested in the subject of smartphone addiction and other negative effects of digital technology overuse on our mental health, I’m assuming that you’re not only concerned with your own individual, personal mental health.</p>

<p>You’re probably concerned with the mental health of your lover, friends, coworkers and family members as well.</p>

<p>If you have kids, I’m pretty certain that you’re at least somewhat concerned about the impact a 24/7 digital device culture and the apps, games and interactions that run on the devices, have on your kids.</p>

<p>What’s this doing to their developing brain, to their sense of self-mastery, social development; their adjustability as adults?</p>



<p>What’s the right balance? How should we approach this issue? I’m pretty sure you don’t know the answers - much less as I do. We don’t have the perfect answers. But we can start by doing a few things:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Instate #OfflineSunday</strong> - or offline any day - in your household. Just as a simple, weekly, short digital detox, and a reconnection and mental health check. Are we really addicted?</li>
<li>
<strong>Limit your own screentime as explicitly as you do your kids’</strong>. Don’t only tell them they can use their pc, tablet, smartphone or whatever device holds their interest for longer than you feel is productive and healthy - lead by example. “Daddy’s going to write some, I’ll be on my laptop from 10:00 am to 12:00 this morning, and after that I’m all yours and we can go...[insert something fun and dad-like, here].”</li>
<li>
<strong>The kicker: Have the conversation</strong>(s) about the effects of digital technology on our time, energy and focus; our relationships and our general wellbeing. Assume you don’t have all of the answers, but try to ask the right questions. Try to do your own research. And maybe, like the participants in that workshop in november, you’ll find my book to be a great starting point for your conversations.</li>
</ol>

<p>Maybe this one is a nice way to start:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<p>Initially, I wasn’t sure whether to write about this migration project, but when I randomly asked <a href="https://twitter.com/tarynpivots/status/1234966141526671360" target="_blank">if people would be interested</a>, the response was overwhelming. This was a long, kind of boring, very repetitive, and at times incredibly frustrating project, but I learned a lot, and maybe someone else will learn from this too. There may be far better ways to move this amount of data. In the path I went down, there was a huge amount of juggling that had to take place  (I’ll explain that later). Thankfully, I’m a decent juggler.</p>

<p>While most people are probably interested in what we do with our primary SQL Servers (the servers that run Stack Overflow and the Stack Exchange network of sites), this post isn’t about those servers. This post is about what I called a miscellaneous server in a <a href="https://www.tarynpivots.com/post/how-we-upgraded-stackoverflow-to-sql-server-2017/">previous post</a> - more specifically, it’s about the migration of our traffic log data.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Our HAProxy<sup>1</sup> logs aka traffic logs, are currently stored on two SQL Servers, one in New York, and one in Colorado. While we store a minimal summary of the traffic data, we have a lot of it. At the beginning of 2019, we had about 4.5 years of data, totaling about 38TB. The database was initially designed to have a single table for each day. This meant that at the start of 2019 we had approximately 1600 tables in a single database with multiple database files (due to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/maximum-capacity-specifications-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15" target="_blank">16TB size limit of data files</a>). Each table had a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/indexes/columnstore-indexes-overview?view=sql-server-ver15" target="_blank">clustered columnstore index</a>, which held anywhere from 100-400 million rows in it.</p>

<p>I had to move the data from their existing daily tables into a new structure — one table for each month. This needed to be completed on both the NY and CO servers, and the data was stored on spinny drives (Eeek). No matter what, it was going to be painful and slow.</p>

<p>Oh, and to make things even more complicated, this had to be done with minimal free disk space on the existing servers. The servers had a 44TB spinny drive partition, and we were using 36-38TB of it, depending on the server. This meant I’d be following these steps throughout the process:</p>

<ul>
<li>migrate data to the new format</li>
<li>delete old data</li>
<li>shrink old database files…yeah, I know, but I had no choice</li>
<li>repeat over, and over, and over again</li>
</ul>

<p>I fully expected the process to take months, and it did — after hitting delays in getting new servers the entire project took about 11 months.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1 </sup>Note: If you’re interested, my colleague, Nick Craver (<a href="https://nickcraver.com/" target="_blank">b</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/Nick_Craver/" target="_blank">t</a>), wrote extensively about our monitoring on his blog and gave an <a href="https://nickcraver.com/blog/2018/11/29/stack-overflow-how-we-do-monitoring/#logs-haproxy" target="_blank">overview of our HAProxy usage</a>.</p>

<h3 id="things-to-remember">Things to Remember</h3>

<p>Before I get started there are a few things I need to mention which impacted the project:</p>

<ul>
<li>I work remote 100% of the time, so I would not be able to run any of the processes from my local computer. Everything needed to be executed on a machine that was constantly connected to the network, so there wouldn’t be any VPN failures.</li>
<li>I needed to run this on two separate machines. I was doing this on SQL servers in two different datacenters, I needed a machine in the same location, so I wouldn’t have to deal with slowness over the network.</li>
<li>We have jump boxes that we use for various things at Stack Overflow, and we have one in NY and in CO, which were perfect to run the migration</li>
<li>The old database was still being used in a live production environment, meaning that as I was moving data, we were constantly adding a new table daily. In other words, I had a moving target</li>
<li>The databases are in <code>simple recovery</code> so we don’t have to deal with transaction logs. Our backup is the original source log files and the pair of SQL Servers - NY and CO - are copies of each other.</li>
</ul>

<p>The bullets above were pain points throughout the project. Being disconnected from the VPN meant I’d have to reconnect to monitor the migration progress. Getting booted from a jumpbox, meant that whatever process was running would need to be kicked off again, after some clean-up. Since we were still inserting new data I was chasing the target, the longer it took, the more data I’d be moving in the end.</p>

<h3 id="why-oh-why-would-you-do-this">Why, oh why would you do this?</h3>

<p>I like to be miserable. Kidding.</p>

<p>There were lots of reasons this needed to be done, one being tech debt. We realized that the original daily table structure wasn’t ideal. If we needed to query something over several days or months, it was terrible — lots of <code>UNION ALL</code>s or loops to crawl through days or even months at a time was slow.</p>

<h3 id="why-not-delete-or-purge-some-of-the-data">Why not delete or purge some of the data?</h3>

<p>As I mentioned, we were dealing with very little free disk space on both servers. This data is primarily used by the developers for investigating issues and by the data team for analysis. We already had purged some data, but for the data team - more data is better.</p>

<p>Instead of purging, the plan was to eventually get new hardware to replace them, but we weren’t exactly sure when that would happen. The goal was to migrate the data to the new format, then when we got new servers it would be as simple as moving the drives to get the new database in place (or so we thought).</p>

<h2 id="so-it-begins">So It Begins</h2>

<p>Each server had the following drives and approximate free space:</p>

<ul>
<li>a 230GB C: drive for Windows - obviously we wouldn’t put data files here</li>
<li>a 3.64TB NVMe D: drive - containing tempdb, one data file, and the log file for the existing HAProxyLogs database - it was approximately 85% full</li>
<li>a 44TB E: drive filled with spinny disks - with the remaining 3 data files for the HAProxyLogs database - this was anywhere from 85-90% full</li>
</ul>

<p>There was not a lot of room to move terabytes of data to a new database on the same server.</p>

<p>Since new servers were on down the road, I asked about the possibility of getting more disk space. Having more space would give me some breathing room to not be so crunched during the process. After some research, it was decided that we could fit a couple of additional NVMe SSDs into both servers. We only had PCIe slots available in the server, so we ended up using U.2 NVMe drives on PCIe adapters to get us some space. The SSDs gave us a brand spanking new F: drive that was <strong>14TB</strong> of free space. While I couldn’t move everything to the new drive, it gave me plenty of space to work with, at least, for a little bit.</p>

<p>Now that we had free space to use, it was time to set up the new database and begin the migration. I wrote the script to create the new database:</p>

<p>The database was going to have all of the old historical tables (i.e. the 40TBs) stored on the <code>TrafficLogs_Archive</code> filegroup, and we’d use the <code>PRIMARY</code> and <code>TrafficLogs_Current</code> for newer data being added.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that the <code>TrafficLogs_Archive</code> filegroup went on our already very full E: drive, instead of the new F: drive - more on that mistake later.</p>

<h2 id="moving-all-the-data">Moving All The Data</h2>

<p>We had a database, so it was time to start the migration. To be clear, I was actually taking over a process that was started, stopped, and then punted from several years earlier. The project was on the backlog of things to be done long before I became the DBA at Stack Overflow. Back then, everyone realized what a time consuming project this would be, and since we didn’t have the resources to devote to it, the can continuously got kicked down the road. As a result, more and more tables were added making the overall task a lot larger.</p>

<p>Since this had been a previously abandoned project, there were already some scripts written, which meant I wasn’t totally starting from scratch. I was handed a couple of scripts to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create all of the new monthly tables</p>

<p>Last updated: July 30th, 2020<br>Comment and join the discussion on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23998324">Hacker News (&gt;77 comments, &gt;122 points)</a></p>

<p>Even though some cities have dedicated bicycle infrastructure, it's of no use if you don't know where
it is. While Google Maps is excellent for car navigation (and the dominant market leader), it 
often has patchy cycle infrastructure coverage and tends to generate cycle routes on busy roads.</p>

<p>The best dataset of cycle infrastructure worldwide (and in Sydney) is
<a href="https://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>. OpenStreetMap is like Wikipedia but a 
map; anybody can edit it, and the sheer number of contributors ensures accurate data.
Many cyclists (including myself) contribute to this dataset.</p>

<p>While the data is extremely detailed (see 
<a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Bicycle">this page</a> for some of the detail
OSM captures), the niche market of cyclist navigation means there aren't many apps that have a 
polished user experience. This comparison of navigation apps is biased towards commuter-focused,
easy to use apps.</p>

<p>Below: Display of OpenStreetMap cycling data in Sydney using 
<a href="https://www.cyclosm.org/#map=14/-33.8790/151.2190/cyclosm">cycleosm.org</a> - it's pretty
detailed hey! Check the data near where you live - chances are it's great, and if not head
to <a href="https://openstreetmap.org/">openstreetmap.org</a> to fix it. 
<i>(note: you'll need to
zoom in to see new features like some pop-up cycleways, zoomed out views are
updated once a week on this map)</i></p>
</div><div>

<h2>What's the best app?</h2>
<p>In my personal opinion, <a href="https://citymapper.com/sydney?set_region=au-sydney"><strong>Citymapper</strong></a>
(on <a href="https://citymapper.com/sydney?set_region=au-sydney">web</a>,
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/apple-store/id469463298">iOS</a> &amp;
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.citymapper.app.release">Android</a>).
A bit about the app:</p>
<ul>
<li>It gives excellent cycle directions (routes)
<ul>
<li>The underlying data comes from <a href="https://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>, which anybody can edit</li>
<li>It uses the route generation algorithm designed by <a href="http://cyclestreets.net/">CycleStreets.net</a>, a not-for-profit spun out of research at Cambridge. <a href="https://www.cyclestreets.net/help/journey/routing/">It takes into account</a>:
<ul>
<li>The path surface quality and infrastructure design</li>
<li>Delays caused by traffic signals</li>
<li>Delays (or savings) caused by topography and hills</li>
<li>One-way streets</li>
<li>Private access</li>
<li>Bicycle dismount signs</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>It's free to use</li>
<li>It's delightful (and easy) to use:
<ul>
<li>When navigating it shows your path in psuedo-3D, easy to follow</li>
<li>Apple: Apps of the year 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017</li>
<li>Google Play: Editors' Choice + Best Apps of 2016, 2017</li>
<li>London Design Museum: Designs of the Year</li>
<li>MTA New York: Grand Prize Winner</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It's available on the web at <a href="https://citymapper.com/">https://citymapper.com/</a>, iPhone and Android devices</li>
<li>It lets the user choose between safe (but slower) routes, medium, and fast (but more dangerous) ones</li>
<li>The app is solely designed for transit and cycling</li>
<li>Citymapper (the company) is pro-transit:
<ul>
<li>They write about their transit research on <a href="https://medium.com/citymapper">Medium</a></li>
<li>They launched a travel pass in London for mobility as a service</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Some (possible) downsides to CityMapper (depending on your point of view):</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't give voice annoucements, turn directions or reroute when you diverge from the route <b>(Note: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24000388">A Citymapper employee reached out and said this is coming soon!</a></b></li><b>
<li>It’s only available in select cities (though Sydney and Melbourne are included)</li>
<li>It’s closed source by a private company</li>
<li>The basemap (background imagery) is Google Maps, not OSM
<ul>
<li>It doesn’t display OpenStreetMap or encourage editing due to this</li>
</ul></li>
</b></ul><p><b>
<h2 id="disclosure-of-interests">Disclosure of interests</h2>
<p>I have no personal or financial interest in Citymapper or any of the apps below, just a user. I am, however, strongly pro-cycling, pro-transit, and a frequent volunteer surveyor for OpenStreetMap 😀</p>
<h2 id="thoughts-on-bicycle-routing-apps">Thoughts on bicycle routing apps</h2>
<p>In rough order of what I would use <i>for commuter cycling in Sydney</i>. For a more detailed feature comparison, see the Wikipedia article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_bicycle_route_planning_websites">Comparison of bicycle route planning websites</a></p>

<![CDATA[Show HN: Hand-drawn timelines using RoughJS]]>

July 30, 2020 | https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/blog/entry/hand-drawn-timelines-using-roughjs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/blog/entry/hand-drawn-timelines-using-roughjs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>ChronoFlo Timeline Maker's latest new feature allows you to give your timelines an eye-catching hand-drawn appearance.</p><div>
						<p>Ever since we first came across <a href="https://shihn.ca/">Preet Shihn's</a> amazing hand-drawn shapes library <a href="https://roughjs.com/">RoughJS</a> a few years ago, we have wanted to use it in one of our products. The sketchy-appearance lends a quirkiness and care-free feel to a user interface that we love.</p>
						<p>At the start of this month, we found ourselves with a bit of free time. We had finished most of the key features we wanted the initial version of <a href="https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/">ChronoFlo Timeline Maker</a> to include, and were wondering what we should turn our attention to next.</p>
						<p>During a brain storming session, Preet's hand-drawn shape library was mentioned, and after a quick look at some of the examples on the RoughJS website, we decided our next big feature would be to use RoughJS to display timelines with a hand-drawn style.</p>

						<!--<div class="tlsp-lf-call-to-action">
							<a href="/">Create a hand-drawn timeline for free</a>
						</div>-->

						<p>The aim was to create two hand-drawn themes, one light and the other dark, that users could select to give their timelines a 'sketched' appearance. We also wanted to give the users the ability to control the amount of roughness via a slider, similar to the slider you can find below the timeline above.</p>
						<p>We were not sure how long it would take us to integrate RoughJS with our event panel and timeline rendering algorithms. Unlike other timeline maker products, ChronoFlo Timeline Maker offers multiple event panel designs and numerous timeline layouts, including both <a href="https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/timeline/shared/3114/USA-Presidents-Timeline/">horizontal</a> and <a href="https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/timeline/shared/3120/Vertical-Yellow-Mellow/">vertical</a> formats, and even a <a href="https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/timeline/shared/3117/UK-Coronovirus-Timeline/">3d parallax-style</a> design.</p>
						<p><a href="https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/timeline/shared/3249/USA-Presidents-Timeline-Hand-Drawn-Dark/">
								<img alt="US Presidents Timeline" title="US Presidents Timeline" src="https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/assets/images/blog/hand-drawn-dark.jpg">
							</a>
						</p>
						<p>A timeline combining ChronoFlo's unique 3d view and our new Hand Drawn Dark theme.</p>

						<p>Getting all these designs and layouts to render with a hand-drawn appearance was not going to be easy. Thankfully, RoughJS is a neat bit of software with an easy-to-understand api, and we had a proof of concept up in not too much time.</p><p>Then there was all the fiddly work of making sure that RoughJS worked with all the different timeline scenarios our software can output, bug fixing, testing, tweaking etc. About a month from initial idea to feature release. Not too bad, when you consider it was not the only thing we were working on.</p>
						<p>And now ChronoFlo Timeline Maker boasts a feature that - as far as we are aware - no other timeline maker product on the market offers: hand drawn timelines. Big thanks to Preet and RoughJS for making this possible.</p>
						<p>Let's now take a look at how you can take advantage of hand-drawn timelines yourself using ChronoFlo Timeline Maker. It's really easy to do.</p>
						<p><span>1</span> Go to <a href="https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/">www.chronoflotimeline.com</a> and log into your account. If not already logged in, click on the 'Go to my account' button.</p>
						<p><span>2</span> Now on your account page, select a timeline to edit. If you haven't created any timelines yet, this is the time to make your first timeline. Make sure you add some content to your timeline.</p>
						<p><span>3</span> The next step is to choose one of our hand drawn themes. You do this by clicking the options button to the right of the screen, bringing up our admin panel. Choose the 'Change the appearance of your timeline' option. Then, select 'Hand Drawn Light' or 'Hand Drawn Dark' from the Theme drop down menu. Make sure to save.</p>
						<p><span>4</span> You now have a hand-drawn timeline to play with and wow your friends or customers with.</p>
						<p>Expert timeline makers might want to try a few other things. The hand-drawn style looks better with some event panel designs than others. So you might want to explore the different panel designs via the 'Panel' option in the 'Timeline Appearance' section.</p>

						<p>You can also make your own hand-drawn themes. The theme edit panel now includes a slider for roughness. Drag this to the left or right to make a theme have a messier or neater look.</p><p><img alt="US Presidents Timeline" title="US Presidents Timeline" src="https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/assets/images/blog/hand-drawn-edit-theme.jpg">
						</p>
						<p>Create your own hand-drawn themes using our new 'roughness' slider.</p>

						<p>We really hope you like ChronoFlo Timeline Maker's new hand-drawn timeline feature, and can't wait to see what you create using it. Please share with us your hand-drawn timeline creations via social media or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:hello@chronoflotimeline.com">hello@chronoflotimeline.com</a>.</p><p>As usual, you can keep up to date with the latest ChronoFlo Timeline Maker news and developments by following us on <a href="https://twitter.com/chronoflot">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/chronoflotimeline/">Facebook</a>. If you have any questions about our software, please email us at <a href="mailto:hello@chronoflotimeline.com">hello@chronoflotimeline.com</a>.</p>

        <p>Johanna Larsson is a community-minded software engineer whose project, Hex Diff, generates highlighted git diffs, right in your browser. In this episode, we talk to Johanna about how Hex Diff can benefit Elixir users, the differences between code architecture and code design, and the debatably under-appreciated role of Elixir umbrella apps. We start the conversation by chatting with Johanna about her recent move to London and her work for Duffel; a startup helping travel agencies book trips. After talking about how she got into software development, we dive into Hex Diff versus GitHub, with Joanna detailing how Hex Diff offers greater security for your code. We ask Johanna about the origins of the Hex Diff project and she explores its aims and her experiences working on the project. In line with this month’s theme, we discuss what architecture means to Joanna and the need for domain-driven design. We quiz Joanna on her approaches to problem-solving and she explains how her coding process emphasizes building an early prototype and constantly iterating on it. Despite hearing that umbrella apps are bad news, Joanna makes a case for their value while acknowledging how that they need greater tooling. We round off our conversation by asking Joanna how she tries to grow her skillset and what her favorite Elixir resource is. Following our discussion with Johanna, we open with another edition of Pattern Matching with Todd. This week, friend of the podcast Todd Resudek asks five questions of Elixir community member Bruce Williams. They talk about Bruce’s work as an Arabic cryptologic linguist for the US Airforce, his software career, and the therapeutic uses of playing Animal Crossing during a pandemic. </p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I built a new workstation with somewhat beefy <code>AMD Ryzen 3950x</code> CPU and got a bit over-excited with
tuning it and getting the max (trying to reduce <code>rust</code> compile times) out of it 😅. One thing led to
another and I ended up with a <code>Corsair H150i RGB PRO XT</code> AIO to keep this thing cool enough.
Everything worked well until I found out that Corsair does not provide any support for Linux 🙄.
It was usable, as this device holds its config on board and does not need support from OS/Software to run,
but one can only adjust any settings or view any status in Windows.</p>

<p>How do I use this device in Linux? I wanted to look at the useless but pretty stats about how fast the
pump and fans are spinning, what is the temperature of the coolant? After all I gotta kill time when
<code>ferris</code> is churning bits…</p>

<h4 id="where-to-start">Where to start?</h4>

<p>My very first thought was to sniff the communication between the software and the device and replicate
it, problem solved! That is what I ended up doing but it wasn’t easy. I started with searching and asking for help</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/rustlang?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@rustlang</a> anyone has any pointers to start hacking on USB devices. I want to do some reverse engineering for a device that has no support for Linux 🤫</p>— Harry (@mygnu_) <a href="https://twitter.com/mygnu_/status/1285575881348587525?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 21, 2020</a></blockquote>



<p>I had no idea how USB devices work, apart from you plug them in and they play. I started reading up on USB protocol.
Here are some resources that I found very useful to get me started with reverse engineering and
understanding USB protocol in general.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.usb3.com/whitepapers/USB%203%200%20(11132008)-final.pdf" target="_blank">USB3 Specifications (PDF)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Usb-Complete-5th-Edn-Jan-Axelson/9781931448284?qid=1596018469423&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">USB Complete 5th Edition (book)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In a nutshell USB is completely controlled by the host, it will sit there until host device makes a
request for a Transaction. To control a device we need to take these steps (I’m over-simplifying here)
get device info -&gt; configure its endpoint -&gt; run a command. Don`t worry if it doesn’t make sense for now
it didn’t for me either, hopefully it will start to make sense at the end of this article.
I strongly recommend to go thorough the resources above to help with the process.</p>

<p>Before we can reverse engineer a device we need to understand what it does and how it does. I started
with capturing packages, because it was supported only on windows I created a VM.
After a few unsuccessful attempts to install the software provided by Corsair in the VM
(it required OpenGl for some reason).
I ended up setting up a dual boot for Windows. After some <em>duckduckgoing</em> (if that’s even a word) I installed
<a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/USB" target="_blank">Wireshark</a> and <a href="https://desowin.org/usbpcap/" target="_blank">USBPcap</a>
to capture the USB traffic when the software was reading stats information off the device. I still
couldn’t see any USB interfaces listed in Wireshark to capture. But I could use USBPcap command line tool
to capture packets flying back and forth, between my AIO and the PC. That was Ok but not ideal as I could not
see live packets to see what packet is transferred when the values changed in the Corsair software. Later on,
I found the following tip buried in one of the youtube video comments and it worked.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>for live capture USB packets in wireshark, copy <code>USBPcapCMD.exe</code> into <code>wireshark\extcap</code> directory</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I had the needed data, and ‘commands’ that i could try to replicate. As you can see in the screenshot
below it is a sequence of commands <code>GET DESCRIPTOR</code> for <code>DEVICE</code> and then <code>Configuration</code> and various
other requests and responses. Later on we’ll see that after the initial setup it is just a couple of alternating
request are made to the device to receive sensor data. Corsair software parses the response and displays fan/pump
speeds and coolant temperature etc we’ll get to that later but lets setup our project in rust.</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-a-rust-project">Setting up a rust project</h3>

<p>On my Linux machine I ran <code>lsusb</code> to see the usb devices attached, and there it was
<code>Bus 001 Device 002: ID 1b1c:0c22 Corsair H150iRGBPROXT</code>, vendor and product IDs matching with the captured
data as expected.</p>

<p>I started a new rust project <code>cargo new rcue</code> named it <code>rcue</code> just because the software I’m
trying to replicate is called <code>iCue</code> 😜. Some awesome rust developers have already made a rust crate
<a href="https://lib.rs/crates/rusb" target="_blank">rusb</a> that provides safe bindings for <code>libusb-1.0</code>. For this project we only
need two dependencies as following.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="toml"><span>[</span><span>dependencies</span><span>]</span>
<span>rusb</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.6"</span>
<span>byteorder</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1.3"</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>byteorder</code> is an awesome crate, it will become handy as we see later. I looked at the examples provided
by the <code>rusb</code> repo <a href="https://github.com/a1ien/rusb/tree/master/examples" target="_blank">here</a> and started with just
reading some basic information about the device.</p>

<h3 id="configuring-usb-device">Configuring USB device</h3>

<p>Back to our captured data, if I filter the direction of all data going to the device, I can see a sequence
first three packets are for requesting information, presumably to confirm that we are connected to the required
device. Forth request (7th if you count responses) in the screenshot below is doing something. I think
it’s configuring the device endpoint. A USB device can be configured in many different ways as you might
have seen/read in the resources above. Since our device only has one configuration as confirmed in the output of
our program, there is no real point re-configuring it to the same one, but we’ll do it anyway for
the completeness sake.</p>

<p>The relevant piece of information here are the data that is sent or <em>the last 9 bytes</em>. Let’s try replicating
this in our program. To configure the device properly we need to claim it. That require some extra information
for the attached device i.e. its interface, settings and address identifiers. Let’s setup a function like the following.</p>

<p>We know how long you have been waiting for an interview with a famous person in the crypto world — <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoYoda1338" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CryptoYoda</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We complied with your request and asked him about his popularity, blog, and crypto world. We also asked him to make a forecast for the future of the crypto world and evaluate Utopia P2P in terms of crypto abilities.</p>



<p>Therefore, take a seat and enjoy reading the story of a successful person. Let’s start.</p>







<div><figure><img src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/successful-person.jpg.webp" alt="CryptoYoda’s Twitter page" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/successful-person.jpg.webp 444w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/successful-person-300x265.jpg.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px"></figure></div>



<p><strong>1. First, introduce yourself, please, and share with us how you reached such a high level in your niche and got so many subscribers?</strong></p>



<p><em>Hello everyone! Thanks for inviting me to this interview. To introduce myself, in this space, I am operating under the pseudonym CryptoYoda with a strong emphasis on cryptocurrency, technical analysis, and spiritual matters of life. These are three areas I am especially keen to explore and share thoughts about constantly. The reason I chose the avatar of Yoda for my communication channel is the shared interest in ideologies, world view and focus in life. As such, the original Yoda devoted his life to learning, solitude and teaching, acting as a role model for my own ambitions in this world. I am therefore constantly reminded of the path I am walking and where it will lead me if I diligently pursue the many learnings of this life.</em></p>



<p><em>My rise in this space really came from a period of deep desperation. Deeply unsatisfied with the state of the world, reluctant to work for companies that solely have profit in their minds while further adding to the cause of the problems at the world stage, depressed and struggling to find my own way in life </em><em>—</em><em> this was the fertile ground where I sow my own seeds of ambition. I was poor but had time. I was in bad shape, but I strived for something greater. I began to climb out of the darkness, and even I did not know where my path will be leading me.</em></p>



<p><em>At that time, I saw something in the markets that barely anyone else seemed to notice: The early but impending ALTS rise. I saw it as a tremendous opportunity for life-changing profits. During the bear market that followed the 2014 All-Time-High, I thus studied in-depth all various ways to spot Major Trend Reversals early, enter with conviction, and ride it all the way up with a lot of patience. So when the time came to plant seeds, I was ready, willing, and able to act on my belief firmly. But it was not enough. There was this unsettling feeling to share what I saw at that time, and a good friend of mine encouraged me to create a Twitter account to spread my views to space. Recognizing it as my path, I created the Avatar CryptoYoda </em><em>—</em><em> which really isn’t me but just a portion of my personality </em><em>—</em><em> and began sharing everything I saw in the markets at a rapid rate. In the beginning, there was almost no interaction with my tweets, but I continued just for the sake of doing so. I was not in search of followers or engagement. I was in a mission to spread my perspective so others might profit from it and provide mentorship in this game that I never had myself.</em></p>



<p><em>Making a long story short, the demand for this kind of information was intense. I proceeded with opening a blog to elaborate in more detail about the market conditions at hand. I remember posting around 100 tweets a day when things really went uphill. It was astonishing to see how much attention these tweets generated. ALTS popped left and right, and I attempted to be as technical as I can be, taking fundamentals into the equation and emphasizing the former.</em></p>



<p><em>Fortunately, I was right on the spot. ALTS really lifted and resulted in the strongest alt season yet. I encouraged people to enter early with solid technical breakouts. Several trades really stood out. I began buying BTC around the $250 mark, accumulated $LTC at below $4, $XRP at half a cent, and ETH at a dollar, with all these trades/investments, ended up being phenomenal in terms of returns. This naturally led to much attention and interest in the account. The increase of followers gained in the year of 2017 was remarkable. However, I was entirely unprepared for operating on the world stage at that time, and at times simply overwhelmed with the responsibility that comes with a large following, so it was not all shine &amp; glory but a constant challenge to grow in all parts of my life which continues to this day. After all, life is about learning, so I welcome the opportunity to grow through the challenges presented in this space and become a better and more helpful person.</em></p>



<p><strong>2. CryptoYoda, you are known for your crypto market reports. How would you describe the current state of the market of cryptocurrency?</strong></p>



<p><em>My perspective on the markets is really divided. On the one hand, the market seems to be eager to pursue higher valuation generally. On the other hand, I remain cautious about BTC’s possibility of making a strong move in either direction, which would inevitably lead to turbulence and percussion in alt markets specifically. Closing above the critical $10,500 mark would very likely lead to a strong longterm rally for BTC. How alts will react to such a sudden move is a question that yet needs to be answered and will provide key insights for identifying the market phase we are currently in. Is the market ready for planting longterm seeds in ALTS? Perhaps it is, but I favor a more conservative strategy this season, integrating my experiences from past BTC moves and its effect on the whole alt market.</em></p>



<p><strong>3. How do you think, who is in charge of cryptocurrency I’m sure that many have no idea how does it work on the whole.</strong></p>



<p><em>To think the crypto market is a free market, without manipulation, is a dangerous thought for nothing could be farther from the truth. Because early players had the opportunity to mine &amp; buy large chunks of BTC at very low valuations, the options for manipulations are manifold. The entry of institutional traders/investors further increased the possibility of manipulation for their own good. So in today’s view, I think both institutions and whales heavily manipulate the market. Trading and Price Action has changed tremendously over the years – which makes a lot of sense considering that early crypto investors mostly weren’t professional traders and had a general lack of market understanding. With the entrance of institutions and High-Frequency algorithms, trading ended up a great deal more difficult due to traps being constantly and consciously placed to take advantage of more uneducated and impatient market participants. However, this lies also a great opportunity to grow as a trader, as trading in itself demands constant growth and expansion into higher quality and increased understanding of the underlying principles of market structure and behavior of market participants. But in terms of manipulation, there is no reason to believe that it is less or different from any other market in the world. Greedy powers will always be looking to orchestrate movements for their own gain. This is one reason why the world is in such a bad shape right now, and it will take a great spiritual evolution to change this behavior for good. But this is something for another time perhaps.</em></p>



<p><strong>4. Why does the Bitcoin price move so much? Okay, for now, it’s a world economic crisis because of the Coronavirus. But it also happened before.</strong></p>



<div><figure><img src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/Bitcoin-price.jpg.webp" alt="Bitcoin future on the market" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/Bitcoin-price.jpg.webp 1024w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/Bitcoin-price-300x200.jpg.webp 300w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/Bitcoin-price-768x513.jpg.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p><em>I wouldn’t say that Bitcoin moves more or quicker than in the past. I feel its quite the opposite. The market became much more stable generally, but the intense volatility on key levels will always remain a characteristic of bitcoin and crypto in general. Interestingly, the increased correlation with traditional markets became very evident in the initial season of the corona. It has a lot to do with institutional players entering this market too.</em></p>



<p><strong>5. What are the advantages and disadvantages of cryptocurrencies over FIAT?</strong></p>



<p><em>The advantage of crypto over FIAT clearly is the freedom of choice inherent in this new financial technology paradigm. For eons, people had to trust their governments with the issuance of money without little or no insight into debt mechanisms. We live in a debt-driven economy, with basically all countries due to a debt, which can only increase over time due to massive interest rates on the loans they received. The general understanding of our current economic model is very fragmentary among the global population. This is a vicious cycle without a happy end, as long as we stay in this economic model as a globally connected society. Countries have to accumulate debt to pay for the interest of earlier loans. This will only lead to increased interest payments in the future. It is fair to say that all loans generated to increase the pressure on future generations.</em></p>



<p><em>Crypto offers an alternative to this debt-driven legacy system. A way out, so to say, but therein also lies the greatest risk of this technology. Blockchain tech can be used to give people back the control over their own financials and data. But this, of course, is not in the interest of those currently in control. Blockchain technology can as well be used to monitor, track, and accumulate complex data with the help of AI-technology, which would inevitably lead to restriction of freedom and open the gateways to a dystopian future.</em></p>



<p><em>I like to work with the example of nuclear energy. Despite not being a supporter of this technology in any way, as the harm on the environment is far greater than the benefit generated by its use, it is indeed possible to use nuclear science to generate energy or build nuclear bombs, which could devastate the planet. Was humanity evolved enough to develop such a method? Yes, clearly. Were they wise and mature enough to handle this technology with foresight and caution for all humanity? Clearly not.</em></p>



<p><em>In the same way, blockchain technology can be used …</em></p></article></section></div></div>

<h2>Theory &amp; History</h2>
<p>
While not specifically aimed at building your skills in building and applying Machine Learning
algorithms, learning about the history, development and most importantly early mistakes of AI
development are undoubtedly as important as pioneering the way forward. These are the best pieces to do
so.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Learning online may have begun in the late 90s, but lately, it has been gathering a lot of attention. Especially due to the recent situation of the world with the pandemic and worldwide lockdown, e-learning has proved to be one of <em>the most</em> prominent uses of technology in the 21st century.</p><p>When the pandemic hit the world and all the educational institutions everywhere shut down, e-learning was there as our savior. Learning online was not a new concept to us, yet due to this, e-learning gained another, much more valuable reputation entirely. Now that we knew to learn online was that easy and that flexible, some people even started to question the hype of offline learning.</p><p>It is now safe to say that learning through the internet is a market that is just going to grow in the following few years. <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-e-learning-market-is-expected-to-grow-at-a-cagr-of-over-14-during-the-period-20192025-301047035.html">Researches</a> even conclude that the market size of e-learning is expected to grow at a rate of 10.85% by 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>So, the question is why do you need to integrate personalization in e-learning. Well, the answer is a simple one: It makes the experience better and generates much more value for the learner. First things first, personalization is an important concept for most, if not all online business. <a href="https://www.caboom.ai/blogfeatured/is-personalization-the-future">The scope of personalization</a> has grown so much that many enterprises will use it, or have already been leveraging it to generate value for their customers.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s elaborate on why personalization will change the e-learning experience as a whole.</p><h3><strong>One Size</strong> <strong>Does Not</strong> <strong>Fit All&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>We have left behind the days of pushing the same thing to everyone and anyone. People have preferences on the smallest aspects of their lives, so it is expected that personalization is included on other aspects as well, even in their online learning experience.&nbsp;</p><p>People might have their preferences on the devices they would want to use, the pace they want to follow, the subjects they want to learn and be recommended next, the format of learning (audio/video/text), and whatnot. So, the whole concept of one <em>size fits all </em>should be discarded and we should move towards more advanced approaches.</p><h3><strong>The Pace of Learning</strong></h3><p>We often underestimate the importance of the pace of learning when we are learning with a group of people crammed together in a classroom. The fact that people have different speeds of understanding the things being taught is usually neglected in offline learning.&nbsp;</p><p>This is why, in online learning, it is expected by the user to be able to personalize their speed of learning. There wouldn’t be much difference in online learning and learning in a school if you still have to rush to go to class on time and struggle to meet the speed of other students in the group.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Giving students the control</strong></h3><p>When the application is personalized, it will give students/learners more control of what they are experiencing through the e-learning app. This results in students being able to:</p><ol role="list"><li>Carefully think about their goals from the course they are doing</li><li>Set up their own learning path</li><li>Choose devices to study from that they are the most comfortable with</li><li>Study without the pressure and competitiveness of learning in a group&nbsp;</li><li>Study in various flexible speeds, suited to themselves</li><li>Get&nbsp; course recommendations on what they can learn next</li></ol><p>In the tech-driven world of 2020, you must give more thought to leveraging technology in your online business. Technology is evolving and bettering itself every day, and we must evolve according to it. We at Caboom believe that <a href="https://www.caboom.ai/blogfeatured/is-personalization-the-future">personalization is the future</a>, and the e-learning industry must use it in their favor.</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[The 3 Problems of Django]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
<h2 id="1-non-admins-">1. Non admins ?</h2>
<p>The problem is pretty obvious: Django admin provides barely anything that’s
usable for non-admin, not even working base templates and sane default features
such as searchable lists with some kind of row level security.</p>
<h2 id="2-no-templates-">2. No templates ?</h2>
<p>For your internet users, Django only generates basic
HTML forms without even a default template that calls <code>{{ form }}</code> and <code>{{ form.media }}</code> and <code>{% csrf_token %}</code>.</p>
<p>For example, Django would need to have a base.html that can display a
<code>View.title</code> attribute, exactly like in all CMS and frameworks that exist on
top of Django, and that <a href="https://docs.iommi.rocks/">Iommi</a> solves with a
<strong>beautiful python API for generating HTML</strong>, because of the problem with
templates (see below), or <a href="https://yourlabs.io/oss/ryzom">Ryzom</a> which also
provide data-binding with django-channels.</p>

<p>This one you would think I have added for the lulz because let’s be honest: who has never tried to code a menu in Python and then went back to doing it in HTML templates and just tell others to live with it ? Well the real problem here is not just having a navigation menu, but also different menus such as the one in the object detail view, or the one in the object list item view that you will see per item on the list page.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest, Django has almost all it needs to generate a menu: it knows the urls, the views, what models the views are for, and so on, it just needs a view attribute for the names of the menus that the view should display in … as well as some hat tricks:</p>
<h2 id="performant-view-per-object-security">Performant view-per-object security</h2>
<p>To generate menus efficiently: you need to be able to code permission code that does not hit the database, which is actually possible with a nice little trick possible by executing views on a target object with the same authenticated request prior to adding a link for this view in this object:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>for</span> <span>view</span> <span>in</span> <span>Controller</span><span>.</span><span>for_object</span><span>(</span><span>object</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>for_menu</span><span>(</span><span>'object_list'</span><span>):</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>view</span><span>.</span><span>clone</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>=</span><span>request</span><span>,</span> <span>object</span><span>=</span><span>object</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>has_perm</span><span>():</span>
        <span>yield</span> <span>view</span><span>.</span><span>as</span><span>(</span><span>'a'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="the-problem-with-templates">The problem with Templates</h2>
<p>Ultimately I would like to reach the level where this is possible:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>IommiView</span><span>:</span>
    <span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>BaseTemplate</span><span>(</span>
        <span>title</span><span>=</span><span>html</span><span>.</span><span>h1</span><span>(</span><span>'Your Title'</span><span>),</span>
        <span>content</span><span>=</span><span>html</span><span>.</span><span>div</span><span>(</span>
            <span>SomeModelTable</span><span>(),</span>   <span># a Table object for some model</span>
            <span>cls</span><span>=</span><span>"large"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>)</span>
    <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><h3 id="glorifying-the-decorator-pattern">Glorifying the Decorator pattern</h3>
<p>Obviously, I believe all 1337 h4x0|2z will agree on eliminating templates, not
even for being slower than pure python, but just to move on to Decorator based
patterns for generating some tag-based HTML source code, just like we would for
any GUI according to the GoF on Decorator patterns.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-generic-views">The problem with generic views</h2>
<p>Anyway, all your CRUD code would be MUCH better with a Controller layer, that
sits between a model and it’s set of CRUD views to form the MVC that makes
modifying the admin so pleasant.</p>
<p>Take this example of registering a full CRUD with the MVC pattern just like the
Admin:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>crudlfap</span><span>.</span><span>Controller</span><span>(</span>
    <span>Artist</span><span>,</span>
    <span>fields</span><span>=</span><span>'__all__'</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>register</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This must enable a working CRUD view that is <strong>superuser only</strong> by default. You
override your Controller.get_queryset which all of the views will call so that
it is <strong>secure by default</strong> (which default CBV <strong>are not</strong>), overriding the
Controller is a lot of fun just like in the admin because it is the result of a
standard <strong>refactor of the code in-between Models and Views</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="mvc">MVC</h2>
<p>This part of the article is proven by <a href="https://yourlabs.io/oss/crudlfap">CRUDLFA+</a>.</p>
<h3 id="example-controller">Example Controller</h3>
<p>To sit in between our view classes and our model, we make a Controller which is the same as a ModelAdmin, DRF ViewSet or a django SmartView. It should centralize the base queryset filter code for all the views of this controller and register just like a ModelAdmin:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>UserController</span><span>(</span><span>crudlfap</span><span>.</span><span>Controller</span><span>):</span>
    <span>views</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
        <span># some view defined above in crud.py:</span>
        <span>ImportView</span><span>,</span>
        <span># a working from imported from mvc.auth</span>
        <span>PasswordResetView</span><span>,</span>
        <span>UserUpdateView</span><span>,</span>
        <span>UserCreateView</span><span>,</span>
        <span># same but overriding a view kwarg</span>
        <span>BecomeUser</span><span>.</span><span>clone</span><span>(</span>
            <span>allowed_groups</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>'Admin'</span><span>],</span>
        <span>),</span>
        <span># with default template with fields/exclude on DetailView</span>
        <span>crudlfap</span><span>.</span><span>DetailView</span><span>.</span><span>clone</span><span>(</span>
            <span>exclude</span><span>=</span><span>[</span>

<p>But you will reach your full potential when you can add your own
<code>ObjectFormView</code> with custom allowance based on properties of the object, ie:

<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>MRSRequestRejectView</span><span>(</span><span>EmailViewMixin</span><span>,</span>

This algorithm takes account of the explicit interaction with the item irrespective of the attributes of the item, so is domain agnostic as long as we have sufficient historical interaction data.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It works with an assumption that if a user <strong>A</strong> likes item <em>X, Y, Z</em>, and user <strong>B</strong> likes product <em>X, Y, J</em> then user A will probably like item J and user B item Z.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Note that these predictions are specific to the user, but makes use of the interactions gathered from many users. This can lead to recommending a diverse set of items that the user might not otherwise have discovered.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This method is mostly used on e-commerce websites. If you have come across recommendations under a section titled "People who liked item X also liked item Y" you have seen Collaborative Filtering in action.</p><p>‍<br></p><h2>Content-Based Filtering</h2><p>In contrast to Collaborative Filtering, Content-based filtering (CBF) uses the attributes/features of the items directly to recommend items to a user. This is done by creating a "user profile" of the preferences of the user for each of these item attributes and then calculating other items most similar to the user's profile. This is done by representing a profile vector of the user in the same dimensions as the item attribute vector and calculating the weights based on users’ historical interaction with the items.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Note that the recommendations are specific to this user, as the model did not use any information from other users. Thus, this type of recommendation does not provide a diverse range of choices as they are only based on items a user has previously interacted with.&nbsp;</p><div><p>This type of recommendation focuses on personal choice or content and is very useful in Job Recommendations as the choice of the job for the user needs to take into account to have a perfect matching job.</p></div><h2>Hybrid Recommender Systems</h2><p>As useful as these methods are they do have some limitations that we need to be aware of. For example, both CF and CBF do not work for new users for whom we don't have any historical interactions or have very few of them. They also don’t make use of other information we might have about the user like their demographic, location etc.<br></p><p>Ideally, we would like to make use of all the information available in diﬀerent data sources and also combine the algorithmic strengths of various recommender systems to make more robust recommendations. Hybrid recommender systems are used for these purposes, and we explore them more through the rest of this blog.<br></p><p>Most recommender systems these days use a hybrid approach by combining CF and CBF approaches. However, there is no reason why several other techniques cannot be hybridized.&nbsp;</p><p>Hybrid approaches can be implemented in several ways:&nbsp;</p><ol role="list"><li>Making content-based and collaborative-based recommendations separately and then combining them.&nbsp;</li><li>Adding content-based capabilities to a collaborative-based approach (and vice versa).</li><li>Unifying the approaches into one model.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Several studies that empirically compare the performance of hybrid recommenders with pure CF and CBF methods have shown that hybrid methods can provide more accurate recommendations than pure approaches. These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as the cold start and the sparsity problem.</p><p>Netflix is a good example of the use of hybrid recommender systems. The website makes recommendations by comparing the view and search habits of similar users (i.e., collaborative filtering) as well as by offering movies that share characteristics with films that a user has rated highly (content-based filtering).</p><p>‍</p><h2>Content Boosted Collaborative Filtering for recommender systems</h2><p>Given the many ways recommenders can be combined, there are many variations of hybrid recommenders in use. In this blog we will focus on one of the earliest and most successful hybrid recommender algorithms called <strong>Content boosted Collaborative Filtering</strong> (CBCF) algorithm.<br></p><p>CBCF is a type of hybrid recommendation technique that uses a combination of content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. Its main idea is to overcome the sparsity problem that degrades the performance of collaborative filtering algorithms by using item content to make the user-item interaction matrix dense.<br></p><p>Its benefits over the pure CF and CBF methods are:</p><ol role="list"><li>Reduces user-item data sparsity</li><li>Handles <strong>cold-start problems</strong> when users have no or very few interactions.</li><li>Handles <strong>first rater problem</strong> for new items who have not been rated or interacted with by any users.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><h2>How does content boosted collaborative filtering work?</h2><p>As we mentioned the basic idea behind CBCF is to use content-based filtering to convert a sparse user interaction matrix to a dense matrix, and then use CF to make the recommendations.&nbsp;</p><p>This is shown in Figure 1.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f1577b91af0b55804e61cec_61SMAsWQOTUzrv77PH-A5Voc8xzh1zEn28bIgaSt3jQUZwnQjxJ21NNPN2mduVdi7e_mjKryaLOwdQFmVMqrirhenUgFu-AxaRDuOtCfEi4ajWFEaTcAhEfG_ZnE025Uo2de3qk.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Fig 1. Basic mechanism of of converting sparse matrix to dense</figcaption></figure><p>The overall architecture of the recommendation system is shown in Figure 2.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f1577ba90654535d9f5beb2_1ShNtwf2KCq2yeFqoxvxiXOLaS9PphLCMJa0E7NXDlCRgsIiHmGQBslVvtSVH-g56m0Ty3USspQFE1-uSyiOONy6cl_DMZuZliADv-97_aUqnI_OvIzqWRXK-mZRpJP0z37jJc8.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>&nbsp;Fig 2. Architecture of CBCF based recommender system&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><div><p>This architecture tries to predict the preference for items not yet interacted by the user based on the similar items rated by the user. For this, it groups the most similar interacted items based on the content and then gives weights to each of these neighboring items based on user preferences. The average of these weighted content feature vectors is then used to calculate the predicted preference for the item. This way we will have a predicted score for each item for a user, which becomes the new user-item dense matrix.&nbsp;</p></div><h2>Variation using Deep Learning Prediction Model for better recommendation</h2><p>With the advent of modern deep learning techniques, several variations of the content-based model have been developed. These methods create an item profile (feature vector) that are especially useful for text based features that are prevalent like item reviews, description etc.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f1577ba2ba25e595d015e23_pJgAoZtYFVWa_F0xBnr7__Qku6CdsmMxdV6D-clAH_ObVvlTvMU-wCRyicVumj61SxiP0-esr28yxbvaDGLvuAEEWG7FlC4A48-vNpZNZ-ett7zyaWPHM6gTlX0cOddXzl_78F4.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>	Fig 3. Variation using Deep Learning based Item Profiles</figcaption></figure><p>In this method, the item profiles are created using feature engineering techniques as before, but not grouped into clusters. The user profile is created based on the historical item interaction. Those two profiles are then combined into a single feature and the deep learning model is trained. After the model is created, the feature is created by combining the item profile not interacted by the user with the user profile, hence a prediction is generated which is used to make the sparse matrix dense.</p><p>‍<br></p><h2>Evaluation and Result<br></h2><p>In order to test the algorithm we used the <a href="https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/">MovieLens 20M Dataset</a> that is widely used for recommender system testing and benchmarking..&nbsp;<br></p><p>The results we got can be seen below.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Pure CF method based on SVD Matrix Factorization</strong><br></p><p>The default sparsity of the user-item matrix was <strong>99.28%</strong>, and the average RMSE error tends to be around 1.0682 with minimum standard deviation.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f1577bac716622a7dacc942_IF0tXRDyIDjRnbsYn9Rc300V1lHQL41S3SV2chFmBFguNOfZrNwV45wGJGrG9yOd-6xxFvX0Qo1A2zwxvO_sQ2T_VOrECCcVUZXsIcybfSCBIUha6O59hgG2KSpj6De_wmZ5un0.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>Hybrid Recommender using&nbsp; CBCF</strong><br></p><p>After applying the CBCF algorithm using a content-based filter, the sparsity 0 as all uninterested item preferences are replaced by the predicted value. The average RMSE tends to be around 0.1099.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f1577ba78093ab286304374_XdvIsW4av8HvhnXwsR3Clo_4WaEPgJN4Au2JFZLA1jeUsoBKiIeTvcIvbkDknbHnP9b8kW_M6AEOkhxJR-5OXLX-aqmolqZvRqITmQtBYeM_ILPUr74IsEyva0FuqjhHVS2NxwU.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>As we can see both the RMSE and MAE values have decreased considerably for the CBCF model as compared to the pure CF method.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The time required to fit (train) and test the model does increase considerably using the hybrid method. This is something that needs to be taken into consideration in production use-cases.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In conclusion, we have seen that the type of recommendation engine algorithm needs to be chosen based on the type of dataset we have. Standard Collaborative Filtering methods although very popular and useful do not always work, especially when the data is very sparse.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For user-specific recommendations where the user preferences data is available and a high degree of personalization sought Content-based filtering methods are useful. Collaborative filtering will work better when there is explicit feedback given and data sparsity isn't too high. Hybrid recommendation methods like Content Boosted Collaborative Filtering takes the advantages of both content and collaborative filtering when we have item attributes, and improves the models by removing data sparsity and reducing errors.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]>

July 30, 2020 | https://serokell.io/blog/lorentz-haskell-newtypes | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://serokell.io/blog/lorentz-haskell-newtypes">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/lorentz-implementing-smart-contract-edsl-in-haskell">previous post</a>, we introduced Lorentz base syntax which allows one to write code in the following manner:</p><pre><code>

<span>distance</span> :: [<span>Integer</span>, <span>Integer</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Natural</span>]
<span>distance</span> = <span>do</span>
  dup; mul
  dip $ <span>do</span> dup; mul
  add; isNat
  <span>if</span> <span>IsSome</span> <span>then</span> nop
  <span>else</span> push [mt|<span>Something</span> went wrong|]; failWith
</code></pre><p>Michelson provides several basic primitives types and ways to group them in products (<code>pair</code>) and sums (<code>or</code>), and we still follow this behaviour.
As noted in a <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/lorentz-complex-objects">spin-off post about Lorentz objects</a>, the opportunity to group types into a sum of products corresponds to Haskell’s datatypes, but one other feature remains unused.</p><p>In this post, we will talk about Haskell <em>newtypes</em> and why they can be a powerful tool in a smart contract eDSL like Lorentz.</p><details>
  <summary>A note about type signature syntax.</summary>
<p>In this article, we are going to write <code>[a, b] :-&gt; [c, d]</code> in signatures, rather than <code>a : b : s :-&gt; c : d : s</code>, for simplicity.
The reader may notice that such methods will not be general enough, but Lorentz has a <code>framed</code> function which makes any given instruction polymorphic over a stack tail, so that is not a big concern.</p>
<p>Also, by Haskell rules, lists of types with less than two elements have to be prefixed with a tick to avoid ambiguity with plain lists.</p>
</details><h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2><p><em>Newtype</em> is a type that is a mere wrapper over another already existing type but may have its custom semantics.
Newtypes are supposed to be free in terms of performance and only affect the type-checking stage, so they allow stricter correctness guarantees to be verified at compile time.</p><p>We have encountered two kinds of real-life examples where newtypes are useful:</p><h3 id="distinguishing-different-entities-with-the-same-representation">Distinguishing different entities with the same representation</h3><p>For instance, it is common for advanced token smart contracts to allow participants to have multiple addresses with money.
The user probably wants to know the balances of those addresses, and eventually, we may need to have three methods for that:</p><pre><code>
<span>getAddressBalance</span>
  :: [<span>Address</span>, <span>Storage</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Mutez</span>]


<span>getParticipantBalance</span>
  :: [<span>Address</span>, <span>Storage</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Mutez</span>]


<span>getOwnerBalance</span>
  :: [<span>Address</span>, <span>Storage</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Mutez</span>]
</code></pre><p>When using these methods in the form they are mentioned, types don’t help us at all.
It is possible to apply <code>getOwnerBalance</code> to an address of a participant by mistake.</p><p>If we manage to make bad code like this impossible to write, that should improve the development experience and correctness of the resulting contracts.</p><h3 id="types-with-invariants">Types with invariants</h3><p>Let’s imagine that business logic assumes you have several flags for each address: whether it is locked by the user, whether the user should be notified by e-mail on balance change, whether the user’s cat is authorized to spend money from this address, &lt;insert your own&gt;.</p><p>A general efficient way to represent such a flag set is by keeping a numeric bitmask.
Following the fail-fast principle, you want to ensure that an invalid bitmask is not produced at any stage across the contract.
And, actually, there might be many places whether the bitmask can become invalid – contract origination, separate flag changes (in case some flags can contradict with others), and changes as a whole (batch update by user). You would like to make sure that no validity check is missing in any of these places.</p><p>In general Haskell code, such problems are often solved by declaring a newtype with explicitly stated invariants and providing constructors/modifiers which treat those invariants.</p><h2 id="our-approach">Our approach</h2><p>In Lorentz, we declare newtypes as follows:</p><pre><code><span><span>newtype</span> <span>MyType</span> = <span>MyType</span> <span>Integer</span></span>
  <span>deriving</span> <span><span>newtype</span> <span>IsoValue</span></span>
</code></pre><p>Let us remind that <code>IsoValue</code> describes how Lorentz types are translated into Michelson, and the <code>deriving newtype</code> clause is Haskell’s syntax that says that behaviour of <code>IsoValue</code> should be inherited from the inner type, <code>Integer</code> in our case.</p><p>Now one can write:</p><pre><code><span>putDefaultMyType</span> :: '[] :-&gt; '[<span>MyType</span>]
<span>putDefaultMyType</span> = push (<span>MyType</span> <span>0</span>)
</code></pre><p>That was simple.</p><p>The main benefit we get is that <code>MyType</code> is treated as a type completely different from <code>Integer</code> or any other newtype wrapper over <code>Integer</code>, so misapplying a function to a wrong argument would raise a compilation error.</p><p>Now we would like to have dedicated methods for converting between newtype and its inner representation.
Lorentz already defines <code>forcedCoerce_</code> method that converts between any two types having the same Michelson representation, but it is pretty broad and requires special care from the developer to be used correctly: a typo or a wrong mental model is pretty likely to cause a bug, so this method should be avoided in business logic layer.</p><p>We would like to allow users to be specific in their intentions via methods specialized to newtype wrapping/unwrapping. For this reason, we define the following methods:</p><pre><code><span>coerceWrap</span> :: <span>Wrappable</span> a =&gt; '[<span>Unwrappable</span> a] :-&gt; '[a]
<span>coerceWrap</span> = forcedCoerce_

<span>coerceUnwrap</span> :: <span>Wrappable</span> a =&gt; '[a] :-&gt; '[<span>Unwrappable</span> a]
<span>coerceUnwrap</span> = forcedCoerce_
</code></pre><details>
  <summary>One more note about type signatures.</summary>
<p>Being part of the library, these two methods are of course defined in a <a href="https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/blob/99fbc99defdedd02568f59cc692c0f021cc9209e/code/lorentz/src/Lorentz/Coercions.hs#L90">more generic way</a></p>
</details><p>Note the <code>Wrappable a</code>: when our newtype does not have any invariants and can be wrapped and unwrapped safely, we declare it to have a <a href="https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/blob/0574c85b78214129b5673b0f8e09b0761711522f/code/lorentz/src/Lorentz/Wrappable.hs#L20"><code>Wrappable</code></a> instance.
It looks like this:</p><pre><code><span><span>newtype</span> <span>Participant</span> = <span>Participant</span> <span>Address</span></span>
  <span>deriving</span> stock (<span>Generic</span>)
  <span>deriving</span> anyclass (<span>IsoValue</span>, <span>Wrappable</span>)

<span>authenticate</span> :: '[<span>Participant</span>] :-&gt; '[]
<span>authenticate</span> = <span>do</span>
  coerceUnwrap  
  sender        
  assertEq [mt|<span>Method</span> executed not by the expected participant|]
</code></pre><p>We deem <code>coerceWrap</code> to be always safe: if a given newtype has invariants, it should not instantiate <code>Wrappable</code> typeclass in favor of another way we will consider a bit later.</p><h3 id="newtypes-with-invariants">Newtypes with invariants</h3><p>Now let us consider the previously mentioned example with bitmasks.
As before, we declare a dedicated newtype:</p><pre><code>

<span><span>newtype</span> <span>Flags</span> = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> { <span>unFlags</span> :: <span>Natural</span> }</span>
  <span>deriving</span> <span><span>newtype</span> <span>IsoValue</span></span>
</code></pre><p>And there were three use cases for it which we wanted to support.
The first one is constructing a Haskell value that can later be provided in contract origination.
This can be done safely in various ways using built-in Haskell features and is up to the developer.</p><details>
  <summary>We would implement it as follows.</summary>
<pre><code>
<span>flag1</span>, flag2, flag3 :: <span>Flags</span>
<span>flag1</span> = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>1</span>
<span>flag2</span> = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>2</span>
<span>flag3</span> = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>4</span>


<span><span>instance</span> <span>Semigroup</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>where</span></span>
  a &lt;&gt; b = <span>Flags</span> (unFlags a .|. unFlags b)


<span><span>instance</span> <span>Monoid</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>where</span></span>
  mempty = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>0</span>



<span>
<span>instance</span> <span>Bounded</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>where</span></span>
  minBound = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>0</span>
  maxBound = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>7</span>


<span>myCustomFlags</span> :: <span>Flags</span>
<span>myCustomFlags</span> = mconcat [flag1, flag2]




</code></pre>
</details><p>Next, we need to make sure that contract code never produces an invalid value when operating with <code>Flags</code>.
Michelson has many polymorphic operations (<code>ADD</code>, <code>NOT</code>, <code>OR</code>), and it so happened that in Lorentz, one has to explicitly declare which of these operations are permitted for the introduced types.
In our case, this is actually handy: if we allow only logical operations on our <code>Flags</code> type, then its invariants will never get violated during contract execution.</p><pre><code>
<span><span>instance</span> <span>ArithOp</span> <span>And</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>where</span></span>
  <span><span>type</span> <span>ArithRes</span> <span>And</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>Flags</span> = <span>Flags</span></span>


<span><span>instance</span> <span>ArithOp</span> <span>Or</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>where</span></span>
  <span><span>type</span> <span>ArithRes</span> <span>Or</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>Flags</span> = <span>Flags</span></span>



</code></pre><p>In case some flags can contradict  each other, we would rather define a special function that adds flags with care:</p><pre><code>
<span>addFlag1</span> :: '[<span>Flags</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Flags</span>]
<span>addFlag1</span> = <span>do</span>
  ... 
  push flag1
  uniteFlagsUnsafe

<span>uniteFlagsUnsafe</span> :: [<span>Flags</span>, <span>Flags</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Flags</span>]
<span>uniteFlagsUnsafe</span> = <span>do</span>
  forcedCoerce_ @<span>Natural</span>; dip (forcedCoerce_ @<span>Natural</span>);
  or
  forcedCoerce_
</code></pre><p>Using this set of coercions may seem to make the contract less efficient, but because of the optimizer (which any eDSL should have for various reasons), these <code>forcedCoerce_</code> calls will not appear in the resulting Michelson code.</p><p>Finally, the last case is accepting a user-provided value.
This can be useful when the user wants to overwrite the existing value of a flag, and we need to make sure that his input is indeed valid.
Here, newtype helps us draw a line between checked data we can work with or store (<code>Flags</code>) and yet unchecked data we accept as input (let it be just <code>Natural</code> for simplicity).</p><pre><code>
<span>toFlagsUnsafe</span> :: '[<span>Natural</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Flags</span>]
<span>toFlagsUnsafe</span> = forcedCoerce_


<span>toFlags</span> :: '[<span>Natural</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Flags</span>]
<span>toFlags</span> = <span>do</span>
  dup
  push (maxBound @<span>Flags</span>); forcedCoerce_ @<span>Natural</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>IsLe</span>
  <span>then</span> <span>do</span> push [mt|<span>Invalid</span> flags value|]; pair; failWith @(<span>MText</span>, <span>Natural</span>)
  <span>else</span> toFlagsUnsafe
</code></pre><p>The bottom line: in Lorentz, one can use newtypes in a very similar way to how it usually happens in general Haskell code.
Some wrap/unwrap boilerplate in the form of <code>forcedCoerce_</code> calls will still be involved, but now the type system will assist you in ensuring that all the data is used correctly.</p><h2 id="common-questions">Common questions</h2><h3 id="do-i-need-types-if-i-can-write-tests%3F">Do I need types if I can write tests?</h3><p>While types are not meant to fully replace tests, a single newtype wrapper can eliminate the need for an entire category of tests just because buggy code cannot be written using safe primitives anymore.
Furthermore, the type system hints the developer if some check is missing.
This is an especially useful property for library writers, as their users also get a piece of that safety automatically.</p><p>Also (this point is often not taken into account) tests may form quite a large codebase that also has to be maintained, so you would like to avoid writing repetitive tests for trivial failure cases where possible.</p><p>For more details, I recommend Ken Fox’s <a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/12/09/typed-language-tdd-part1/">article</a> explaining why it is beneficial to have both types and tests.</p><h3 id="what-about-formal-verification%3F">What about formal verification?</h3><p>Unlike the described newtypes approach, formal verification allows you to express arbitrary properties of your data and thus has a significantly broader scope.</p><p>However, in practice its use is pretty complicated:</p><ol>
<li>You may need to know a special proof assistant language like Coq to verify your programs;</li>
<li>You have to write proofs yourself.</li>
</ol><p>This way, formal verification may often be infeasible for large contracts.</p><p>On the other hand, newtypes feature lets you put a constraint only on one piece of data at a time, so, for instance, <code>amount &gt; 0 || storage.x &gt; 0</code> …</p></div></div>

<h3 id="short-intro-to-schema-types-in-asyncapi">Short Intro to Schema Types in AsyncAPI<a href="#short-intro-to-schema-types-in-asyncapi" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h3>

<p>There are many different schema formats that one might use to describe the message payload. Not everyone uses JSON Schema. There are multiple formats out there, like RAML 1.0 Data Types, Avro, or even OpenAPI 3.0. When you write your AsyncAPI file, you should not manually convert schemas that you already store somewhere in a format different from AsyncAPI Schema. The best practice is to reuse existing schemas by referring to them in your AsyncAPI file and making sure that the Message object has information about the schema format within the schemaFormat parameter.</p>

<p>AsyncAPI <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/2.0.0/#messageObjectSchemaFormatTable" target="_blank">lists schema types</a> that are a MUST but is not limited to this list only. RAML Data Types is not a MUST HAVE, yet we already have a custom parser for it.</p>

<p>From the AsyncAPI tooling perspective, we have a <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-js/" target="_blank">basic JavaScript Parser</a> capable of parsing schema of the payload provided with AsyncAPI schema format or JSON schema format. Other schema parsers are plugins that you can register with a parser, like <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/openapi-schema-parser" target="_blank">OpenAPI 3.0</a> or <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/raml-dt-schema-parser" target="_blank">RAML 1.0 Data Types</a>. You could provide such plugins as well for your custom formats.</p>

<h3 id="avro-parser">Avro Parser<a href="#avro-parser" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h3>

<p>The 3rd plugin that we now officially support is related to Avro schema type. The first minor version is already out there, and you can give it a try, even if your schemas are in the Confluent Schema Registry. Have a look at the docs of <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/avro-schema-parser" target="_blank">the Avro schema parser</a>. The Avro parser is also part of the latest release candidate of <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/" target="_blank">the Generator</a>. Please help us make it work for you.</p>

<h2 id="circular-references-in-asyncapi">Circular References in AsyncAPI<a href="#circular-references-in-asyncapi" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>Now JavaScript Parser can handle circular references that you might have in your AsyncAPI files. The current implementation fully dereferences circular references, and you cannot change this behavior. We also extended the API to help you out to deal with circular references:</p>

<ul>
<li>The core AsyncAPI model now contains the hasCircular() function that you can use to determine at the very beginning if a given AsyncAPI document contains some circular references or not. An example use case for it is to throw a proper error message to the user with a clear message that circular references are not supported by your tool at the moment,</li>
<li>The Schema model contains isCircular() function to check if a given schema is circular, so you do not have to detect it on your own and adequately react</li>
</ul>

<p>Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-js/pull/94/files" target="_blank">this</a> pull request for implementation details. The work is still in progress as nice features in the Parser do not mean now all the Generator’s templates will support it. Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-js/issues/83#issuecomment-659958312" target="_blank">this</a> comment if you need more details.</p>

<h2 id="typescript-support-in-parser">TypeScript Support in Parser<a href="#typescript-support-in-parser" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>Since Parser 0.27 we will now always generate <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-js/blob/master/types.d.ts" target="_blank">TypeScript types</a> to make it much easier for TypeScript developers to use Parser in their tools.</p>

<h2 id="generator-release-candidate-7-is-out">Generator Release Candidate 7 is out<a href="#generator-release-candidate-7-is-out" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>We just released another release candidate that contains a lot of improvements that we added to the Parser. It also includes the above mentioned <code>avro-schema-parser</code> so it is easier for you to test it out. Give it a try.</p>

<h3 id="publish-vs-subscribe-discussion-continues">Publish vs Subscribe Discussion Continues<a href="#publish-vs-subscribe-discussion-continues" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h3>

<p>We noticed that people that interact with AsyncAPI for the first time are confused about the meaning of those two words, publish and subscribe. Without going much into detail and oversimplifying things, we can say that this is the part of the community that considers using AsyncAPI to describe their internal broker-centric architecture. In such cases, you want to describe the application’s behavior and not what others can do with it. You want to use the Publish verb to specify that your application publishes to a given channel. What if your application is exposed to the outside world where others can interact with it? You want Publish to mean something different, like it is now, that it means your application is subscribed to a given channel, so that you can publish to it, and the application will receive a message.</p>

<p>Event-driven architectures are complex beasts with many patterns, and we should try to make AsyncAPI a single home for all of them. Please engage in this discussion, share your thoughts, and help us out to find the best solution:</p>

  <p>For HA and easier management of our containers we can create swarm cluster.<br>
It is composed of couple nodes with docker engine installed.</p>
<p>How to setup swarm and use it?</p>
<h3 id="example-configuration-and-prerequisites">Example configuration and prerequisites</h3>
<p>In my lab environment I used three nodes:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Role in Swarm</th>
<th>Server</th>
<th>IP</th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Manager</td>
<td>docker-host1.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Worker1</td>
<td>docker-host2.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.21</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Worker2</td>
<td>docker-host3.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.22</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each node has got docker engine installed with standard procedure as for single node docker.</p>
<p>Ports that are need to be open on each node:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>TCP/UDP</th>
<th>Port</th>
<th>What is for?</th>

<li><code>--availability</code> - cloud be <code>active</code>(new tasks allowed), <code>pause</code>(new tasks not allowed, but old keeps going) or <code>drain</code>(new tasks not allowed, finish immediately old ones if they exists) - set drain for manager node to create manager without containers on it</li>
<li><code>--default-addr-pool</code> - by default <code>10.10.10.0/8</code> - we can set another address pool for overlay network created with cluster</li>
<li><code>--default-addr-pool-mask-len</code> - number on subnets that are allow to be created in <code>--default-addr-pool</code></li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>It is strongly recommended to have at least three manager nodes in production cluster for HA. This configuration will survive lost of one manager node.<br>
In such configuration still only one of managers will be leader, rest will replicates data from him and waits for his breakdown.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Join the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23981563">HN discussion</a>!</p></blockquote><p>The existing open-source funding models don't work well for small projects.</p><p>Big projects —&nbsp;operating systems, frameworks, CMSs, or fully self-hostable applications — are in a privileged position to extract more value from their users, especially corporate ones. Since entire APIs and products are built on top of them, they inspire enough appreciation (or, more likely, fear of obsolescence!) to net a sustainable income from one-off or monthly donations.¹</p><p>But most OSS projects aren't big. The typical project on GitHub is better described as a <strong>utility</strong> — an apt term, given the <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/">infrastructural role</a> these projects play in the world. It is a small tool that does one thing really well. Over the course of building a complex application, you may end up using dozens of these utilities — and they'll save you hundreds of hours of development time. </p><p>Unfortunately, utilities like these rarely bring in any meaningful amount of money from donations, no matter how widely used or beloved they are. Consider <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">react-router</a>. Even with 41.3k stars on GitHub, 3M weekly downloads from NPM, and nearly universal adoption in React-based single-page applications, it only brings in <a href="https://opencollective.com/react-router">~$17k</a> of donations annually. </p><p>The root of the problem is that open-source donations are made on a per-project basis². To support a project via GitHub Sponsors or OpenCollective, you must create yet another auto-renewing monthly subscription for each project you want to support. Moreover, at the moment of truth (<em>"I'm gonna sponsor X!"</em>) it's easy to "logic" yourself out of donating (<em>"But what if it gets replaced by some new hotness next week?!"</em>). This has a huge dampening effect on total donations to open source. And in the end, only the projects that are massively, insanely, indisputably useful get funded. And those projects are usually the "big stuff" — frameworks, self-hostable software, etc.</p><p>A new model is needed; one that works for the small- and medium-sized projects, not just the huge ones. So I propose a novel(-ish) approach to OSS sustainability. </p><h2>Introducing "sponsor pools"</h2><ol><li>Every month, you donate some amount into a "wallet".</li><li>Your funds are then distributed to the projects in your "sponsor pool". Your sponsor pool is just the set of open-source projects you want to support.</li><li>Adding new projects to your pool should require <strong>one click</strong> —&nbsp;as easy as starring the repo on GitHub.</li></ol><p>That's it. It's hardly ingenious, which is why it's surprising that no major player in OSS has implemented it for facilitating open source donations.³</p><p>This would achieve the holy grail of OSS sustainability: the one-click sponsorship.⁴ Once a person has funded their sponsor pool, it would take <em>a single click</em> to financially support another project. <mark>The marginal cost — both psychological and financial — of supporting additional projects would drop to zero.</mark> That's a game changer.</p><h3>Why this works better</h3><p>Why do I think this will dramatically increase the total amount donated to open source? To answer that, consider a hypothetical question.</p><p><em>How much of your income would you be willing to donate to open-source software every year?</em></p><p>I suspect the typical overpaid HN lurker reading this post (👋) came up with a number in the hundreds of dollars. Compare that with how much you’re actually donating — is there a difference? There is for me. <mark>That's because there's currently no way to make a donation to the abstract concept of "open source software".</mark> But with sponsor pools, donation amounts will reflect an honest answer to the question posed above.</p><h3>GitHub</h3><p>The best case scenario, in my opinion, is for GitHub to natively support this model as an extension of GitHub Sponsors. It's where most projects live so it's best positioned to create a zero-friction donation system like this.</p><p>Of course, if GitHub implemented something like this, they would likely divorce the donation mechanism from stars. Perhaps instead, users who have created and funded a sponsor pool can be presented with an "Add to Pool" button in place of the current "Sponsor" button.</p><p><img alt="Add to pool button" src="https://vriad.com/add_to_pool.png"></p><p>GitHub has a financial incentive to switch to this approach — sort of. They're currently eating the cost of all processing fees for transactions on GitHub Sponsors. So if you sponsor a project at $1/mo, the maintainer gets $1/mo...and GitHub pays $0.30 to the credit card companies. Larger donation sizes means GitHub pays a proportionally smaller amount as fees.</p><p>Note that I said <em>proportionally smaller</em>. If more total donations are being processed (which is the goal of this proposal!), they may still end up paying more in total fees, even if the ratio of fees-to-donations is smaller. If the sponsor pool concept is massively successful —&nbsp;say, cumulative donations of $1B annually — GitHub will be eating nearly $20M in card fees. I suspect that would ruffle some feathers at Microsoft.</p><p>As a final addendum —&nbsp;I'd love to see embeddable "badges" that are unlocked at different levels of donorship.&nbsp;Imagine a world where you see a "GitHub Sponsor Gold Badge" in the footer of someone’s website, indicating that they donate, say, $1000+ annually to open source. Clicking on this badge would bring you to a trusted site that lets you verify the claim. Here's my quick-and-dirty attempt at a badge design:</p><p><img alt="order of the gold octocat" src="https://vriad.com/gold_octocat.jpg"></p><p>Some may cry "virtue signaling" but approaches like this are a proven way to establish positive reinforcement loops that a) increase awareness and b) encourage more folks to donate to open source.</p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p>This is a hard problem with a vast array of potential solutions. I don't mean to criticize any existing approaches; they've all done a lot for maintainers, including myself, and I don't mean to minimize that. There may also be major implementational or regulatory hurdles to building something like this that I'm not aware of. This is merely a hypothetical exercise.</p><p><em>My name is Colin and write proposals like this one every month or so. Put your email in the box to get future proposals delivered to your inbox. ✌️</em></p></div><div><p><em>Alternatively follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/vriad">on Twitter</a> or subscribe to <a href="https://vriad.com/rss.xml">the RSS feed</a>.</em></p><h3>Footnotes</h3><blockquote><p>¹ Some examples of financially successful large projects.</p><ul><li>operating systems: Red Hat, Elementary OS</li><li>frameworks: Livewire, Next.js </li><li>CMSs: Ghost, Wordpress</li><li>Full-featured applications: Sentry, Blender, Discourse</li></ul></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>² It's worth noting that currently GitHub Sponsorships actually correspond to a given user or organization, NOT a particular repository or project. </p><p>I think it's important that the sponsorship pools themselves are comprised of projects, <em>not</em> users or organizations. This gets complicated if multiple entities/organizations are listed as the maintainers of a particular project. There would need to be a mechanism in place to split the incoming donation money among the set of maintainers as they see fit.</p></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>³ It's been pointed out to me that <a href="https://flattr.com/">Flattr</a> uses this exact model! Unfortunately they're not intended for open source software specifically and simply don't have enough awareness to really move the needle. For this model to reach it's potential, it needs to be implemented by a visible, trusted, established player.</p><p>Other organizations trying interesting things: <a href="https://snowdrift.coop/">Snowdrift</a> ("crowdmatching"...very cool concept), <a href="https://flossbank.com/">Flossbank</a> (a Tidelift-like model), <a href="https://gitcoin.co/">Gitcoin</a>.</p></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>⁴ The even holier grail: a zero click sponsorship! An example of this approach is <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave Browser's</a> token-based micropayments system. Brave lets you fund your "wallet" with various cryptocurrencies, which are then distributed to creators proportional to the time you spend on their site.</p><p>It’s a great idea, but surveillance is necessary to gather the requisite information. This is implemented ethically by Brave, but that’s only possible because they control the full browser experience. For this to work across browsers would require an extension with full access to your browsing patterns. So probably a non-starter.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]>

<p><em>We at Stratiteq love to explore new technologies and see how they can be applied in real life. Here is a story of one of our recent projects.</em></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB">Inspiration for this project came from&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasas-dragonfly-will-fly-around-titan-looking-for-origins-signs-of-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><span lang="EN-GB">NASA’s Dragonfly</span></span></a><span><u><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;mission</span></u></span><span><span lang="EN-GB"> that was announced last year&nbsp;and&nbsp;will be launched 2026 with&nbsp;the&nbsp;goal of exploring Titan, the largest moon of Saturn. Dragonfly will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;drone-like spacecraft, size-wise like&nbsp;the&nbsp;Mars<s>-</s>rover, and it will be&nbsp;the&nbsp;first vehicle ever that is capable to transfer its entire&nbsp;scientific&nbsp;payload from one place to another&nbsp;on&nbsp;Titan’s&nbsp;surface&nbsp;for&nbsp;material analysis. Dragonfly is&nbsp;not&nbsp;the only&nbsp;mission that will&nbsp;use drone technology. The&nbsp;Perseverance rover that will be launched tomorrow (July 30, 2020) will&nbsp;also&nbsp;carry&nbsp;the&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><span lang="EN-GB">Mars Helicopter</span></span></a><span><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;with it to Mars&nbsp;in order&nbsp;to test this technology for the first time on&nbsp;another world.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB">Our project, Dragonfly Mini, is&nbsp;an&nbsp;autonomous vehicle&nbsp;that consist of a rover and a drone.&nbsp;The rover is powered by&nbsp;an&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-nano/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><span lang="EN-GB">NVIDIA Jetson Nano</span></span></a><span><span lang="EN-GB">,&nbsp;a&nbsp;small supercomputer that is capable of processing different AI algorithms.&nbsp;The rover can move autonomously,&nbsp;but it can also be controlled&nbsp;remotely.&nbsp;It&nbsp;is equipped with&nbsp;a camera and&nbsp;mobile phone that is used&nbsp;as&nbsp;an&nbsp;access&nbsp;point&nbsp;to the Internet.&nbsp;</span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB">Besides&nbsp;being a communication device, we also made full usage of&nbsp;the&nbsp;mobile phone cameras, sensors and&nbsp;its&nbsp;processing power.&nbsp;</span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB">The rover&nbsp;is capable of controlling&nbsp;camera equipped drone, which&nbsp;gives it better overview of the surrounding area.&nbsp;Collected data is processed with&nbsp;the&nbsp;Jetson Nano and data points are uploaded to&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><span lang="EN-GB">Microsoft’s Azure cloud</span></span></a><span><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></span><span><span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>In order to test our rover, we decided to take a trip to Iceland. Besides being able to record in a nice environment, Iceland is over 2000 kilometres away from our home office in Malmö and we consider it to be an impressive enough distance for a test of this project. Tests were done in the southern part of Iceland and we were careful to test it on allowed areas only, since, as you probably know, moss on Iceland is protected and if damaged takes years to grow back. If you are planning a similar experiment, please have that in mind. Feel free to check the video below to see what people who worked on the project said about it.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB">There were different challenges in order to&nbsp;execute&nbsp;this project.&nbsp;The first&nbsp;thing we had to figure out is how to move the rover. We equipped&nbsp;the&nbsp;Jetson Nano with a&nbsp;camera,&nbsp;and we trained it&nbsp;for&nbsp;obstacle&nbsp;detection through deep learning.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span></span></p>

<p>It's two days before Jessica will be unable to pay her rent for the first time in her life, and she is standing at the gate of the private charity "Hermandad del Refugio" in downtown Zaragoza. Here in the capital of the Aragon region, between Barcelona and Madrid, the summers are hot and the winters windy. Around 10 a.m. in late May, the sun is already scorching.</p>


<p>There are 18 men and women ahead of Jessica in line, standing silently, their arms folded across their chests. They are all pulling shopping trolleys, into which they'll pack milk cartons, noodles and two kilograms (4.4 pounds) of chicken. Without the free food provided by the Catholic charity, the people in line would have trouble making ends meet.</p>

</figure><p>The coronavirus pandemic brought large parts of the Spanish economy to a standstill. When Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced the lockdown on the evening of March 14, shops, restaurants, concert halls and shops all closed down and from one day to the next, public life and the economy ground to a halt. Within six weeks, 760,000 people had lost their jobs -- on top of the more than 3 million people who had already been unemployed at the beginning of the year. Another 3 million were furloughed.</p>

<div>
<h3>More Hungry People</h3><p>Jessica, too, lost her job, though she didn't actually have to be laid off. Jessica is a singer and In March, she was still working with an orchestra. Technically, she was only ever employed for the day of the performance, but she still earned enough money to survive. A portion of the 900 euros ($1,016) she earned a month was paid out in cash.</p><p>She received notice of her termination via WhatsApp and in mid-May, Jessica went to a food bank for the first time. She'd rather not give her last name. "It makes me sad to stand in line here," she says. The charity in downtown Zaragoza is currently providing 2,271 people with free food, and increase of 504 since before the lockdown.</p>
</div>


<div>
<p>The same thing has been happening all over Spain. In the cities of Madrid and Barcelona, but also in rural areas, Catholic charities have provided 60 percent more aid than in previous years, says Raúl Flores of the Foessa Foundation, which is investigating the social situation for Caritas.</p><p>The lines of hungry people are growing longer and longer and they are the most visible sign of what the country can likely expect in the coming months: the worst economic crisis since the end of the Spanish Civil War in 1939. According to worst-case estimates by the Bank of Spain, the economy could shrink by up to 14 percent and unemployment could rise to 21 percent, which would push the country's sovereign debt load to 130 percent of the country's gross domestic product.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>A New Social Law Is Born</h3><p>The coronavirus crisis has accelerated the debate in Spain over the introduction of a basic income, since state-funded social aid does not yet exist. It wasn't until the death of the dictator Franco in 1975 that a welfare state developed here, though it was rather week. Families with children receive hardly any support.</p><p>The introduction of a basic income was therefore the main election promise of the leftist Podemos party and they made the program part of their coalition agreement with the Socialists last fall. Now the Sánchez government is rushing to get the project off the ground to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from plunging into the abyss.</p><p>"It is a historic moment for our democracy," said Podemos leader and Deputy Prime Minister Pablo Iglesias, "the birth of a new social law."</p><p>Spain, after all, still hasn't fully recovered from the consequences of the financial and economic crisis of 2008. Even before the outbreak of the virus, the poverty rate hovered around 20 percent and the labor market is divided, with too few people enjoying permanent contracts with unemployment benefits, and too many having to make do with temporary contracts that often only last for a few days. According to statistics from the Spanish employment agency SEPE, 8.4 million people are now looking for a job.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>The Only Way to Survive</h3><p>Thus far, only regional governments have allocated aid money -- paltry sums that reached only 75,000 people, or barely a third of all the poor, according to social researcher Flores. Basic income would provide financial security for the most vulnerable 850,000 households.</p><p>But an "ingreso mínimo vital," literally a "minimum income to live," comes with strings attached. The program would only apply to people between the ages of 23 and 65 and they must have been registered as living in Spain for at least one year without interruption. They must also be actively looking for a steady job, be involved in a continuing education program or, in cases of drug dependency, be enrolled in a therapy program. The social welfare office would look into applicants' assets and existing income and that would be topped up to a level of 462 euros per month for singles and up to 1,015 euros per month for a family of five.</p>

<p>For 2.3 million Spaniards, a basic income is likely the only way to get through the corona crisis. Nowhere is this more evident than in Madrid, the city hit the hardest by the pandemic. The capital is one of the richest regions in the country, yet there are plenty of needy people, such as in the tangled side streets from behind the Puerta del Sol to the Plaza de Jacinto Benavente.</p><p>The Ave Maria food bank, run by the city, mostly takes care of the homeless, but since March, geriatric nurses, waitresses and salespeople have also been showing up. All of them have lost their jobs. The crisis first hit those who worked illegally or only had short-term contracts, often foreign workers who had found a precarious job during the recent economic upswing. They were among the first to be laid off.</p><h3>A Real Boost</h3><p>One of them is Mario Ignat. The 30-year-old came to Spain from Romania eight years ago and has been working in construction ever since. But there's no more work to be had. In Madrid alone, 138,000 people have lost their jobs and half a million have been furloughed, a consequence of around 1,000 companies going bankrupt each week during the lockdown.</p><p>Ignat hasn't yet lived in Spain for 10 years, so he doesn't have Spanish citizenship. He earns barely enough to pay rent and there is nothing left over for going out with friends, having a beer in the bar next door or even cooking for himself. The new basic income could significantly improve his life.</p><p>For Mario Ignat and Jessica, a lot depends on when the money will actually be paid out. They can apply for the basic income starting on June 15 and before the end of the month, the first 100,000 eligible applicants will receive aid retroactively going back to June 1. That, at least, is what the government has promised. Jessica hopes that she won't end up on the street before then.</p><p><em>With reporting by Oliver Imhof in Madrid</em></p>

<p>This is about a reaction I noticed with myself in response to membership programs, patreons and individual sponsorship as I've run into significantly more of these following Corona. The advertising-supported model has confirmed many of the concerns about its sustainability and creators are looking for more reliable options. I think this feeling I have might be something other people experience and something for creators to be prepared for.</p>
<p>Creating anything in a sustainable fashion is hard work. You are fighting uphill against a cultural expectation for things to be free on the web. Often a simple solution is a good solution. The simplest way is asking ones extremely enthusiastic fans to chip in, often with some incentive, such as bonus content. It is a solution with strongly aligned incentives, those who pay get more of the thing they like and they are already invested in sustaining the creation. The creator gets paid without needing to tailor their format or subject matter to the whims of sponsors or advertisers and can focus on making what the fans already want. Well-aligned incentives.</p>
<p>I think this model is great when it works, I think CGP Grey <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aN44ETT6mUY">made his case very well</a>. He generally makes tightly produced videos with long times between releases. YouTube advertising monetization is not optimized for his content though I'm sure it does pretty well. Beyond that the pandemic means companies cut down on advertising and this pushes more creators to try this model as rates go down and opportunities dwindle.</p>
<p>I've noticed something about my reaction to an increasing number of memberships. They frustrate me. Especially when they come in groups or too closely. This is a feeling, my robotic logic, I'm mostly human. I feel a bit of an "ugh" even before I consider whether the offer makes sense for me or not.</p>
<p>Part of it can be FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). I absolutely dislike not having access to all of the content or behind-the-scenes for something I follow enthusiastically. Part of it can be the normal reaction to a kind of paywall. But generally the podcasts, newsletters and stuff that I follow aren't actually removing anything. They are just adding some premium stuff. I still feel that twitch, that small frustration.</p>
<p>So what do I think it is? A kind of fatigue, as the title indicates. I want to support, I want to engage. But I also want to be mindful in how I spend my money. And $5/month adds up pretty quickly. There is a lot of consideration in committing that recurring payment for .. indefinite duration. And I think I'm getting sick of deciding. I always feel an element of shame if I don't support a creator I like. I think a key term here is support. Positive thing right? You are supposed to support good things. So why aren't you being supportive? This is of course a bit irrational and you shouldn't feel bad. As often is the case with feelings, we don't get to decide them.</p>
<p>Let's call this the <strong>Five Dollar Fatigue</strong>, sounds catchy. If the trend continues I can be a thought-leader and I'm sure that's good for something. So yeah, the feeling of growing frustration connected to things you like or love continuously asking you for money.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to lower the internal conflict when this kind of arrangement is brought up.</p>
<p>For me, personally. I think I might need to figure out what my actual budget is for supporting independent creators on a monthly basis. Then I don't have to re-evaluate it each time something I like wants my financial support.</p>
<p>For creators. I think most are thoughtful and graceful when they ask for the money and I think it would be worse if they were as heavy-handed as Wikipedia for example (lots of pressure and guilt in all communication, I've complained to them repeatedly). I think creators just need to be ready for the possibility that some fans will still react poorly, or more grudgingly accepting than enthusiastic not because of that particular arrangement but because of all the ones considered before it.</p>
<p>If you have thoughts on this piece of writing do let me know at <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a> on Twitter. If you want more of my writing I have
    a non-tracking newsletter which usually comes with
    podcast recommendations and more in-depth thinking. Often about sustainability in software.</p>

Something like that.</p><p>Needless to say, that didn’t happen.</p><p>Now, it may look like I am in an enviable position, running a profitable, growing, low-maintenance software business serving adoring customers. But for years, I considered myself a failure. At my lowest point, I had to lay off 75 percent of my company, including many of my best friends. I had failed.</p><p>It took me years to realize I was misguided from the outset. I no longer feel shame in the path I took to get to where I am today — but for a long time, I did. This is my journey, from the beginning.</p><h2>A weekend project turned VC-backed startup</h2><p>The idea behind Gumroad was simple: Creators and others should be able to sell their products directly to their audiences with quick, simple links. No need for a storefront.</p><p>I built Gumroad the weekend I thought up the idea, and launched it early Monday morning on Hacker News. The reaction exceeded my grandest aspirations. Over 52,000 people checked it out on the first day.</p><p>Later that year, I left my job as the second employee at Pinterest — before I vested any of my stock — to turn Gumroad into what I thought would become my life’s work.</p><p>Almost immediately, I raised $1.1M from an all-star cast of angel investors and venture capital firms, including Max Levchin, Chris Sacca, Ron Conway, Naval Ravikant, Collaborative Fund, Accel Partners, and First Round Capital. A few months later, in May 2012, we raised $7M more. Mike Abbott from Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers (KPCB), a top-tier VC firm, led the round.</p><p>I was on top of the world. I was just 19, a solo founder, with over $8M in the bank and three employees. The world was starting to take note.</p><p>We grew the team. We stayed focused on our product. The monthly numbers started to climb. And then, at some point, they didn’t.</p><p>To keep the product alive, I laid off 75 percent of my company — including many of my best friends. It really sucked. But I told myself things would be fine: The product would continue to grow and no one far from the company would ever find out.</p><p>Then, TechCrunch got wind of the layoffs and published “Layoffs Hit Gumroad As The E-Commerce Startup Restructures.” All of a sudden, my failure was public. I spent the week ignoring my support network and answering our customers’ concerns, many of whom relied on us to power their businesses. They wanted to know if they should look for alternative products. Some of our favorite, most successful creators left. This hurt, but I don’t blame them for trying to minimize the risk in their own businesses.</p><p>So what exactly went wrong, and when?</p><h2>Failing in style</h2><p>Let’s start with the numbers. This is our monthly processed volume, until the layoffs:</p><p><img src="https://sahillavingia.com/0_z7tBf5i6wH-HbLhU.png"></p><p>It doesn’t look too bad, right? It’s going in the right direction: up.</p><p>But we were venture-funded, which was like playing a game of double-or-nothing. It’s euphoric when things are going your way — and suffocating when they’re not. And we weren’t doubling fast enough to raise the $15M+ Series B (the second major round of funding) we were looking for to grow the team.</p><p>For the type of business we were trying to build, every month of less than 20 percent growth should have been a red flag.</p><p>But at the time, I thought it was okay. We had money in the bank and product-market fit. We would continue to ship product and things would work out. The online creator movement was still nascent; the slow growth wasn’t our fault. It always looked like change was right around the corner.</p><p>But now, I realize: It doesn’t matter whose “fault” it is; we hit a peak in November 2014 and stalled. A lot of creators absolutely loved us, but there weren’t enough of them who needed our specific product offering. Product-market fit is great, but we needed to find a new, larger fit to justify raising more money (and then do it again and again, until acquisition or IPO).</p><p>In January 2015, after our final double-or-nothing hail-mary, our bank balance dipped below 18 months of runway. I told my 20-person team the road ahead would be a tough one. We didn’t have the numbers to raise a Series B, and we would have to work really hard over the next nine months to get even close. To that end, we deprioritized everything except features that would directly move the needle. Many were not core to our business, but we needed to try everything we could to get our monthly processed volume to where it needed to be.</p><p>If we succeeded, we would raise money from a top-tier VC again, hire more people, and pick up the journey where we’d left off. If we didn’t, we would have to drastically downsize the company.</p><p>In those nine months, when the whole team knew we were fighting for our company’s life, not a single person left Gumroad. From “this is gonna be hard,” to “yep, turns out it was,” every single person worked harder than ever.</p><p>We launched a “Small Product Lab” to teach new creators how to grow and sell. We shipped a ton of features, including weekly payouts, payouts to debit cards, payouts to the U.K., Australia, and Canada, various additions to our email features, product recommendations and search, analytics to see how customers are reading/watching/downloading the products they’ve purchased, and add-to-cart functionality. And that was just between August and November.</p><p>Unfortunately, we didn’t hit the numbers we needed.</p><h2>Slim down or shut down?</h2><p>Looking back, I’m glad we didn’t hit those numbers. If we’d doubled down, raised more money, and appeared in the headlines again, there would have been a very real possibility of even more spectacular failure.</p><p>With that off the table, our options were:</p><p>Shut down the business, return the remaining money to investors, and try something new.</p><p>Continue with a slimmed-down version of the company to aim for sustainability.</p><p>Position the company for an acquihire.</p><p>Some of my investors wanted me to shut down the business. They tried to convince me that my time was worth more than trying to keep a small business like Gumroad afloat, and I should try to build another billion-dollar company armed with all of my learnings — and their money.</p><p>I tended to agree with them, to be honest. But I was accountable to our creators, our employees, and our investors — in that order. We helped thousands of creators get paid, every month. About $2,500,000 was going to go into the pockets of creators — for rent checks and mortgages, for student loans and kids’ college funds. And it was only growing! Could I really just turn that faucet off?</p><p>If I sold the company, it would be mostly for our stellar team — and I would no longer be able to control the destiny of the product. There were too many acquisition stories of companies promising exciting journeys and amazing synergies to come — and ending with a deprecated product a year later.</p><p>Selling was certainly tempting. I could say I sold my first company, raise more money, and do this all again with a new idea. But that didn’t sit right with me. We were responsible to our creators first. That’s what I told every new hire and every investor. I didn’t want to become a serial entrepreneur and risk disappointing yet another customer base.</p><p>We decided to become profitable at any cost. The next year was not fun: I shrunk the company from twenty employees to five. We struggled to find a new tenant for our $25,000/month office. We focused all of our remaining resources on launching a premium service.</p><p>In June 2015, a few months before our layoffs, our financials looked like this:</p><ul><li>Revenue: $89,000 for the month</li><li>Gross profit: $17,000</li><li>Operating expenses: $364,000</li><li><strong>Net profit: -$351,000</strong></li></ul><p>A year later, in June 2016, our monthly numbers looked like this:</p><ul><li>Revenue: $176,000 for the month</li><li>Gross profit: $42,000</li><li>Operating expenses: $32,000</li><li><strong>Net profit: +$10,000</strong></li></ul><p>It hurt, but it meant creators would keep getting paid. It also meant that we were in control of our own destiny.</p><h2>From skeleton crew to lifestyle business</h2><p>It got worse from there.</p><p>Gumroad was no longer the venture-funded, fast-growing startup our investors and employees signed up for. As everyone else found other opportunities, the skeleton crew fizzled from five to one.</p><p>I was basically alone. I didn’t have a team, nor an office. And San Francisco was full of startups raising gobs of money, building amazing teams, and shipping great products. Some of my friends became billionaires. Meanwhile, I was running a “measly” lifestyle business. It wasn’t what I wanted to do, but I had to keep the ship from sinking.</p><p>Now, I understand some people would dream to be in that position. But at the time, I just felt trapped. I couldn’t stop, but there was only so much I could do as an army of one.</p><p>For years, my only metric of success was building a billion-dollar company. Now, I realize that was a terrible goal.</p><p>I shut off the rest of the world. I didn’t tell my mom about the layoffs — she had to read the article and tweets herself to find out. My friends were worried, but I assured them I was neither depressed nor suicidal. I left San Francisco for long stretches at a time, thinking that some travel would give me adequate distance. It only made me more lonely.</p><p>Every day, I woke up and took care of all of Gumroad’s support queries. I tried to fix all of the bugs I could. Often, I had to ask for help from former Gumroad engineers. They were all employed by then, but they always found time to help. Once all things Gumroad were taken care of, I tried to go to the gym, and if I had the willpower, work on a side project (a fantasy novel). Most days, I failed.</p><p>To me, happiness is about an expectation of positive change. Every year …</p></div></div>

July 29, 2020 | https://forum.kee.pm/t/a-critical-security-update-for-keepassrpc-is-available/3040 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://forum.kee.pm/t/a-critical-security-update-for-keepassrpc-is-available/3040">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Today we published a new version of KeePassRPC (1.12.1) which resolves critical security vulnerabilities in all previous versions of the plugin.</p>
<p><strong>To ensure that your passwords stored within KeePass Password Safe remain secret, you must <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/upgrading-keepassrpc/22">install this new version</a> immediately.</strong></p>
<p>This does not affect Kee browser extension users that store passwords only in <a href="https://keevault.pm/">Kee Vault</a>.</p>
<p>This is not a vulnerability in the Kee browser extension so re-installing, updating, downgrading, disabling or removing Kee will not affect your exposure to this risk.</p>
<p>If you are unsure whether you are affected, simply follow the instructions for <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/upgrading-keepassrpc/22">updating KeePassRPC</a>. If you find an old version of <em>KeePassRPC.plgx</em> on your computer, you should replace it with the newest version immediately.</p>
<p>Download version 1.12.1 or newer from GitHub and install it right now. If you’re unsure how to install a new version of a KeePass plugin, we have documentation to help you at <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/upgrading-keepassrpc/22">Upgrading KeePassRPC</a>.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Additional information about the update</summary>
<p>Version 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 both contain the fixes for these vulnerabilities. If you’re one of the few people who have installed version 1.12.0, you only have to upgrade to 1.12.1 if you want to connect the KeeBird Thunderbird email client extension to KeePassRPC. Unless you already have version 1.12.0 installed, please <strong>install version 1.12.1</strong>.</p>
<p>If for some reason you are unable to update to the new version, some mitigating actions include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lock your KeePass databases and do not unlock them until the plugin has been updated</li>
<li>Close all web browsers and do not browse the internet until the plugin has been updated</li>
<li>Change the websocket <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/keepassrpc-port/2360">port that KeePassRPC listens on</a>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The 3rd suggestion relies on security through obscurity and is thus unlikely to greatly reduce your risk for very long. Obviously all 3 of the above suggestions are very significantly worse than simply updating the plugin straight away.</p>
</details>
<h3>About the vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>Credit for discovering and responsibly disclosing the two related vulnerabilities goes to Philipp Danzinger, Michael Pucher and Georg Merzdovnik for helping explore the vulnerabilities as well as co-developing and hosting the proof of concept exploits.</p>
<p>Successfully exploiting either vulnerability results in an attacker gaining access to all passwords in any open KeePass databases. No obvious user interaction is required, only a visit to a malicious web site; in some cases there is no visible evidence that the vulnerability is being exploited.</p>
<details>
<summary>
'ALL' passwords may not strictly be true for every user. Expand this section to learn about the subtle potentially mitigating details</summary>
<p>KeePassRPC offers an occasionally-used feature called “Kee home group”. For each open database in KeePass, KeePassRPC will only reveal passwords if they are contained within this group.</p>
<p>Additionally, individual password entries can be hidden from KeePassRPC.</p>
<p>For most people the entire database of entries was at risk of exposure but for those that utilise either of these two features, that action may have limited the set of entries that were at risk of exposure.</p>
<p>Even if you used these features to manage your entries, an additional factor may still have allowed <em>all</em> entries to be exposed. As explained in the KeePassRPC user interface and existing documentation, enabling the KeePass placeholders feature is a security risk in its own right. If you had any entries visible to KeePassRPC which had the placeholder feature enabled, it is feasible that an attacker could have used this to access all entries.</p>
<p>It is also worth remembering that KeePassRPC only ever sees entries which have a URL field set so if that field is empty, the contents of the entry can only have been at risk if you also utilised the placeholders feature.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> An initial version of this announcement stated that remote code execution would be possible via placeholders. Deeper investigation has confirmed that this was not possible. Apologies for the additional alarm but I felt it was better to err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>We consider this to be the most serious category of security vulnerability and implore you to take immediate action - KeePass does not have an automatic update feature so <strong>you must apply the fix yourself</strong>.</p>
<p>These vulnerabilities were not previously publicly known so <strong>if you take prompt action, it is extremely unlikely that your passwords have been exposed</strong>. However, it is not possible to determine with 100% certainty that you were not targeted by a malicious attacker so you may wish to change your passwords, at least somewhat sooner than you otherwise would have done. For what it’s worth, I will personally be undertaking a password change procedure on all passwords that can feasibly be used to access systems that affect the integrity or security of KeePassRPC, the Kee browser extension, Kee Vault and all related services. Otherwise, I think that the risk is low enough that I will not be accelerating my usual 5-20 year change cycle for any other passwords.</p>
<p>Your master password is never exposed through KeePassRPC and the security of your kdbx file remains intact. It is the individual entries within your KeePass database that were at risk.</p>
<p>Kee 3.5 contains many improvements relating to password saving so if you choose to change any of your website passwords, you may wish to do so using the <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/beta-testing-the-kee-browser-extension/2022">latest beta version</a>. We’ll be requesting that this version of Kee is released to all Kee users very soon but it can take many weeks for the web browser developers to approve a new release.</p>
<p>The two vulnerabilities outlined below reside in the SRP authentication implementation; successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the usual password-based authentication procedure.</p>
<ol>
<li>A piece of information supplied by a KeePassRPC client was not correctly validated before being relied upon in the SRP algorithm.</li>
<li>The use of a non-cryptographically secure random number generator in a cryptographically sensitive calculation vastly increased the chance of an attacker being able to guess their way past the usual protection that SRP offers. On some systems a successful exploitation could go unnoticed and complete in less than one minute, although in many cases it would take longer and result in noticeably “strange” behaviour that could alert a user to the threat before it succeeds.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both vulnerabilities have now been addressed and I have additionally developed a further security layer to reduce the chance that future vulnerabilities in the SRP server could be exploited by malicious websites. In case this additional security layer poses a problem for any consumers of KeePassRPC that are not modern browser extensions, the information I’ve posted in <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/configuring-keepassrpc-1-12-permitted-websocket-origins/3041">this new documentation topic</a> will allow you to work around the new limitation.</p>
<h3>What you can do to help</h3>
<p>No single person or organisation can release perfectly secure code so it is great to see the wider security community probing our Open Source software for vulnerabilities like this.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have the experience to help too? As well as reviewing the source code and seeking out vulnerabilities, you may be able to help to reduce the attack surface of KeePassRPC by developing a modern replacement for the HTTP-based communications protocol (websockets) that allowed these vulnerabilities to be exposed to remote systems. We may not be able to make this change without breaking backwards compatibility and it may limit the usefulness of KeePassRPC outside of the context of a browser extension but these drawbacks may be a price worth paying in order to reduce the risk of a similar vulnerability being exploited in future. I’m undecided if it is something we should actively pursue and don’t currently have the resources to implement it alone. Please check out the <a href="https://github.com/kee-org/browser-addon/issues/23">relevant GitHub issue</a> if you are interested in helping out.</p>
<p>If none of the above sounds like it’s your thing please check out other ways you could help at <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/contributions-bugs-help-and-support-guidelines/548">Contributions, bugs, help and support guidelines</a> .</p>
<h3>Closing remarks</h3>
<p>My priority for the past 24 hours has been ensuring a fast and thorough response to the discovery of this vulnerable SRP server implementation. As such, I can’t yet be very definitive regarding how or why these implementation mistakes were made. It appears as though they can be traced back to code that I wrote around a decade ago when so many factors were different to today. At a later date I will perform a more in-depth analysis of the likely causes - my initial thoughts lead me to think that some significant factors will have been the lack of available battle-tested .NET implementations of big integers and SRP6a.</p>
<p>Distributing critical security updates for a KeePass plugin has never been easy but I hope that this announcement, the use of the optional update notification feature within KeePass and the upcoming version 3.5 of the Kee browser extension - which will refuse to work with any earlier version of KeePassRPC - will all go some way towards accelerating the uptake of this important software update. Please point your co-workers, friends and acquaintances to this forum topic if you think they may also need to install this update.</p>
<p>In case it needs explicitly stating, I can confirm that I am personally very sorry that these vulnerabilities were introduced into KeePassRPC and remained present for so long. I am therefore very grateful to the security researchers (Philipp Danzinger, Michael Pucher and Georg Merzdovnik) who discovered the vulnerabilities and so professionally and clearly conveyed their findings to me.</p>
<p>I will prevent replies being added to this topic because posts in this category are often pushed to the community by email but please do post a new topic on this forum if you have any questions - I can’t promise a personal reply but I’ll try my best and hopefully other members of the community can help out when I’m not available.</p>
<p>I’m sure you’ve already done it but just in case: <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/upgrading-keepassrpc/22">Upgrade KeePassRPC.plgx</a> now!</p>

<p><span>T</span>he day Kim Hye-min threw up on the job while working as a graphic designer at a small broadcasting firm in Seoul, she was so overwhelmed by stress that it made her sick to her stomach. When a senior co-worker shamed her for being just a few minutes late, it echoed what she had heard from older South Koreans all her life: she wasn’t good enough. At lunchtime, she made a run for the restroom stall.</p>



<p>“The criticisms kept building up,” she says, until she reached the point where she didn’t think she could take it anymore. For 26-year-old Hye-min, as for many young South Koreans, life choices feel forced and fixed — and not like actual choices at all. Many feel so beaten down by the rigid social and professional demands of their country that they refer to it as “Hell Joseon,” a play on Korea’s old dynastic name. The path is especially bleak for young women, who must contend with the nation’s deeply rooted misogyny. Deviation from the mainstream is widely viewed as disobedient, and sometimes, in the eyes of older generations, even unpatriotic.</p>



<p>“It’s something to do with Korean society,” Hye-min says. “There’s only one way to engage in relationships with others, or one type of person who’s considered acceptable. And for people like me, it’s really hard.”</p>



<p>Again and again, her parents would ask her,<em> “</em>Hye-min, why can’t you be like your classmates and study hard and do well? Hye-min, why can’t you be like your peers and hurry to finish university and get a job?”</p>



<p>Hye-min never understood why she should have to rush through a school system that did nothing but judge and rank her, only to find a lifelong position at a company that would do the same. She dropped out of university for a year before transferring, sought out counseling for her battered self-esteem, and quit her job, despite knowing that all of these choices would be looked upon as failures. Perhaps toughest of all, Hye-min knew that, even if she were to achieve “success,” it was unlikely she’d be compensated fairly for it: <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/employment/gender-wage-gap/indicator/english_7cee77aa-en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Korea’s gender wage gap</a> is the worst in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), with men earning on average 32.5% more than women.</p>



<p>Her parents would ask, “Hye-min, why can’t you be like other women your age and find a nice man and get married?”</p>



<p>Hye-min, however, has no plans to get married. Nor does she expect to have children. After years of being told she must strive to be a good student, good employee, good wife, and good mother, she eventually decided she no longer wanted to partake in a system that ties her social currency and self-worth to such a punishing status quo. So Hye-min opted out. “Why do I have to continue on, going through these difficulties?” she says. “For what?”</p>

<p><strong>In traditionally collectivist</strong> South Korea, individualist loners, or <em>honjok</em>, are becoming increasingly common. The term, which translates to “alone tribe,” shortens and combines <em>나홀로</em>, meaning “by myself,” and <em>족</em>, “tribe.” It’s used to describe a group of people who prefer, out of pleasure or practicality — and, often, utter exhaustion and sheer desperation — to live outside of conventional social structures and simply be alone.</p>



<p>What constitutes being “alone” can be fuzzy, but it ultimately comes down to the physical and psychological boundaries one draws around oneself. Honjok might partake in leisure activities alone, maintain a single-person household, avoid a workplace or office setting, limit social circles, abstain from sex or romantic relationships, or reject marriage or children. At its core, honjok culture is about resisting South Korea’s establishment society and putting individual needs and desires above loyalty to hierarchy and authority. But living independently doesn’t automatically make someone honjok, and identifying as honjok doesn’t preclude being part of a community — especially when that community is virtual.</p>

<p>Within South Korea’s hyperactive cyberculture of online forums, blogs, and social media, an entire taxonomy has sprung up to classify, in ever greater detail, various honjok identities and activities. Many honjok are <em>honyeo</em>, or solitary women, and some honyeo, like Hye-min, are <em>bihon</em>, meaning they reject marriage and often child-rearing. There are also <em>4B</em>s, who take the ethos even further by rejecting sex and romantic relationships. When honjok eat alone, it’s called <em>honbap</em>, and when they drink alone, it’s <em>honsul</em>. They can also play alone (<em>honnol</em>), which might include traveling alone (<em>honhaeng</em>), going to the movies alone (<em>honyeong</em>), or shopping alone (<em>honsho</em>). </p>



<p>All of this contributes to a booming <em>honconomy</em>. On average, South Korea’s rapidly growing single-household population has more disposable income than those with three to four people. By 2030, the Korean Institute of Industrial Economics and Trade estimates single-household expenditures will reach almost 200 trillion won (or about $165 billion) in Korea.</p>



<p>Across the country, companies are cashing in on this lucrative market. Banks offer single-household credit cards. E-commerce platforms list honjok as a stand-alone shopping category, marketing items like tiny washing machines, multipurpose furniture, and one-person settings of dishware. Convenience stores, popular among honjok because of their ubiquitous locations and smaller quantities, put on special promotions and advertise single-serving meals and pouches of alcohol. Food delivery services promote takeout for one. Bars and restaurants promise solo patrons judgment-free service, and honjok-specific establishments set partitioned tables just for them. Specialized karaoke joints feature individual coin-operated booths. Cinemas install single-seat aisles. TV shows like “I Live Alone” and “Drinking Solo” portray honjok life, and news sites like <em>1conomy News</em> exclusively cover single living.</p>



<p>It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly when the concept of honjok first appeared in South Korea, but a Daumsoft analysis shows that the use of terms such as honbap, honsul, and honnol exploded in the first half of the 2010s, going from only 44 total mentions at the beginning of the decade to more than 60,000 in 2016. Over this same period, the rate of smartphone ownership in South Korea rocketed from 14% to over 85%, and on-demand shopping emerged and blended with social media, laying the foundations for today’s cyber-mediated consumer culture. While personal tech adoption has done much to elevate honjok into a national phenomenon, it might also have revealed how many South Koreans were already seeking a way out.</p>

<p><strong>While some honjok</strong> embrace the “hon” and truly go it alone, others turn to the “jok,” the tribe of people like them, for support and validation. In communities both online and off, members strive to normalize the honjok life as a sign of modern times — a decision that is sensible and convenient, and if not something to celebrate, then at the very least nothing to be embarrassed about.</p>



<p>That honjok would need or want to look to others while isolating themselves may seem like something of a paradox. Yet, for many young honjok, the appeal lies in partaking in “a sort of shared identity” while under pressure from a status-obsessed country, says Andrew Eungi Kim, a sociology professor at Korea University. “If you don’t meet mainstream standards, you feel ashamed. With honjok, there is a sense of being a member of a group,” which, in some instances, can be as much about safety in numbers as about true solidarity.</p>



<p>Honjok Dot Com, which operates through a website and a Facebook group, is a honjok resource that describes itself as “the best gift for you alone.” Launched by 31-year-old Jang Jae-young, Honjok Dot Com recommends establishments, from barbecue restaurants to tennis courts, that cater to solo patrons, as well as various on-demand services for managing a single household. Writing over email in January, because he could not (or maybe would not) meet in person, Jae-young observed some positive changes in how South Koreans perceive honjok. “Before, this word generally implied a socially awkward person,” he noted, adding that people&nbsp;understand better now that it refers to those “who confidently choose to remain alone and stay happy.” Jae-young is an example of the latter: he has been single and living alone since 2015.</p>

<p>On King of Honjok, a community app with an accompanying website, solitaries post photos of their daily lives, shop the marketplace for honjok wares, and peruse articles like “The trend these days is ‘I live alone!’” and other content created specifically for them. They occasionally meet in person at King of Honjok events. Thirty-four-year-old co-founder Oh Jung-hee, who has been honyeo for the past decade and sees her friends in person two to three times a year, says that, in a society oriented toward families and couples, she started King of Honjok to help voluntary outsiders like her lead better lives. Whether they use it to be “independent alone” or “independent together” is up to them.</p>



<p>But, as one might imagine of a platform for people who prefer to keep their distance from others, there isn’t much interaction on King of Honjok that points to the making of deep relationships. Posts are fun and lighthearted, and comments are fairly generic, offering an occasional Wow! or Cool! or the Korean way of lol-ing, <em>ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ</em>. Jung-hee estimates that, of the community’s roughly 8,000 members, mostly millennial women in Seoul, about half never interact at all.</p>



<p>That’s absolutely fine, she says, because the purpose is simply to be a presence for an often-marginalized population. That sentiment is echoed …</p></div></div>

<p><strong>Interview with Jozsef Borocz by Boroka Paraszka</strong></p>



<p><a href="http://www.marosvasarhelyiradio.ro/musorok/a-feher-magasabbrendusegrol-borocz-jozsef/"><strong>The original of this interview was broadcast, in Magyar, on Marosvásárhelyi Rádió Romania—a minority-language public radio station in Târgu Mureș, Romania—on July 8, 2020</strong></a></p>



<p>Slightly edited and lightly
annotated English translation by Jozsef Borocz</p>



<p>Boroka Paraszka: You
said you were „at a loss” about the new movements in the US and their reception
in Europe. That surprised me because I thought you had a very defined opinion. </p>



<p>Jozsef Borocz: Well, I
do, and I am very critical. I am „at a loss” in two senses of the word. First,
I am actually shocked by seeing some of the things happening in the USA, even
though I have always been strongly skeptical about the political system, and some
aspects of social reality overall, like all the good people I know—I guess I
belong in a group of intellectuals who are critical observers of reality—but
even I had not expected that the situation would go so far as it has. </p>



<p>In a second sense, I
am reading the reactions to the news in the US by the greatest minds of
Hungarian intellectual scene with a shock. More precisely, perhaps it is too
strong to say that I am „shocked,” since, in a certain way, it was to be
expected that reactions of this kind would be produced—but I find the scale,
the magnitude of the positions, the&nbsp;
severity, the fury and the absence of any empathy or sensitivity,
frankly, breathtaking. </p>



<p>BP: I think that the
Hungarian refusal, the dismissive position is not a Hungarian specialty, it is
true of the rest of eastern Europe.</p>



<p>JB: Yes, of
course.&nbsp; Mostly. </p>

<p>BP: As to why it is
happening, I have no explanation, but if you do have one, I would be curious to
hear it. Where does the degree of indifference with which people react to the
events in the US come from? Let’s say, from the context of the Romanian nation
state, especially those who pursue minority rights, could, in theory, see an
opportunity in the US events, and they could see a positive example in all
this.</p>



<p>JB: &nbsp;Right. If we try to turn this entire gamut of
issues to the history of Hungarian public culture and education, it strikes me
that, at a certain, earlier time, a large part of Hungarian culture—say,
looking at folklore—had an image of idea of self and an ideal of beauty that it
found in itself as “piros-barna legény, piros-barna kislány” (red-brown girl /
boy). Metaphorically speaking, by today, Hungarian conversation has shifted to
seeing itself as “fehérnép” (white folk). I know this contrast is unfair
“methodologically,” as those two metaphors are not directly comparable, and
these are two small examples taken from a gigantic stock of folk metaphors—but
precisely as metaphors I will stay with them for now because I find them
suggestive. My point is that, over the twentieth century or so, educated
Hungarian conversation began imagining itself as “White.” I will clarify what I
mean by Whiteness in a moment. </p>



<p>Now, there are
enormous problems with that. On the one hand, factually, it is untrue. On the
other hand, it is as if, in the absolutely last moment, we were trying to climb
onboard the Titanic of global Whiteness—when we don’t even have a seat
reservation. This is basically how I can define the trajectory of our culture
over the last century.</p>



<p>I have an even better
metaphor to offer. It is based on a historical fact—and it lightens our
conversation on account of it not being about Hungary or Hungarians. Before independence,
today’s Haiti was a French colony, called Saint-Domingue. It was an important
part of the French colonial system. The colonial products grown in Haiti made
up forty to sixty percent of French colonial imports at the time. Haiti had a
plantation-based agriculture, based on slave labor. The news of the 1789 French
Revolution percolated through the colonial system—where all the population
spoke some version of French at the time—so the people of Saint-Domingue, too,
learned about the idea of “droits de l’homme”, human rights, and adopted it as
an inspiration. The result was <a href="http://ouleft.org/wp-content/uploads/CLR_James_The_Black_Jacobins.pdf">a popular uprising that was both an anti-colonial war
and a revolution aiming to put an end to slavery</a>. I obviously cannot recount <a href="https://h-france.net/fffh/maybe-missed/madison-smartt-bells-haitian-revolution-trilogy/">the beautiful history</a> of the Haitian Revolution here—I can only recommend
it for everyone <a href="https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0101-33002011000200010&amp;script=sci_arttext">to find out about it</a>. It is enough to know that, in the more than a decade
long anti-colonial war that ensued, at a certain point, when Poland had been
partitioned and France received a sizeable Polish emigré population, Napoleon
sent a Polish battalion to Saint-Domingue to help extinguish the uprising. The
Polish contingent arrived in the island and soon realized that their political
ideals were best matched not by the geopolitical concerns of Napoleon’s France
but those of the Haitian Revolution. </p>



<p>For us, in our part of
the world, one of the most breathtaking aspects of the history of the Haitian Revolution
is that the Polish battalion sent there by the French switched sides and
supported the uprising.&nbsp; Mind you, some
of the Polish survivors ended up settling there, and there are even today proud
Haitians who claim, partly, Polish family heritage.</p>



<p>There are many
intricacies to this story. My point is that, in the late-18<sup>th</sup>,
early-19<sup>th</sup> century, it was still possible for east European subjects
to experience a political, moral and emotional identification with Black people
and the objectives of the latters’ armed struggles against colonial rule and
slavery. This, by the way, was not unique to Poles—there is ample evidence of
similar positions in Hungarian history as well. </p>



<p>By today, this political,
moral and emotional identification has become almost impossible. </p>



<p>BP: Why?</p>



<p>JB:&nbsp; Look, this is an excellent question, and I
would like to pose it myself. I have no answer. Groups of talented young
historians of political ideas ought to re-examine the corpus of Hungarian
(Polish, etc.) culture to find the causes for this loss.&nbsp; Understanding the underlying causes for the
Whitening, so to speak, of Hungarian culture would allow us to make giant leaps
forward in coming to terms with our collective heritage: Documenting how it
happened that masses of Hungarians began adopting the identity position of west
European Whiteness. The essence of that position is that west European
Whiteness is so exceptional, it is so superior to the rest of the world, that
even questioning that dogma is anathema. Hence there is nothing else for us in
eastern Europe to do than keep repeating our claim that we, too, are part of
west European Whiteness. When we feel that <a href="https://www.academia.edu/33969498/The_Unbearable_Whiteness_of_the_Polish_Plumber_and_the_Hungarian_Peacock_Dance_around_Race_">perhaps we are not exactly considered parts of it</a>, our reaction is repeating the same claim, only more obnoxiously,
if that’s even possible. </p>



<p>This is not going to
work, for multiple reasons.&nbsp; Perhaps the
most important is that this position is deeply immoral. Claiming Whiteness is a
global-historical sin.&nbsp; Being claimants
to Whiteness means that we demand unearned, <em>un-earnable</em> global
privileges. It means claiming to have a “right” to rob Africa of its natural
treasures, from caoutchouc to precious metals, it means claiming a right to
enslave—i.e., kidnap, abuse and sell through “the market”, a market that we
then turn around and call “free”—and engage under unspeakable, dehumanizing
conditions people by the millions and millions. Make no mistake about it, we
are not only talking about the US South and Haiti, in the last several
centuries, but today. West European Whiteness claims a right to mansplain
everybody how they should live—while, for the most part, it has not the
foggiest notion of local conditions. It claims a right to treat with the most
boorish disrespect the cultures, aesthetic achievements, ethical
considerations, problems, etc. of the rest—i.e., the vast majority—of the
world. </p>



<p>BP: At this point many
people start having a certain anxiety in east-central Europe as experiences are
really different around here. Among many other things, partly because of Roma
segregation, partly because of racial homogeneity, most of us don’t really have
experience about what it means when multiple races live together. At this
point, where you say it is a sin to be White, people start to be anxious,
thinking “I have nothing to do with the fact that I was born white,” they would
not even understand what you are saying when you talk about claims to White
superiority, since he or she knows nothing about slavery—here there was no such
thing, although Romania had slavery, it was abolished here latest in Europe,
never mind, so, they feel that if you say that being White is a sin, then that
is a form of racism itself. Hence, they feel victims and not perpetrators.</p>



<p>JB: I have skipped an
important point, thank you for reminding me. Putting forth a claim to global Whiteness
has nothing to do with skin pigmentation. I repeat. Whiteness is not a question
of skin color. Skin color is just an excuse. Whiteness is a category of power,
privilege and (im)morality. There are myriad ways to show that. Perhaps I will
mention only the most obvious one.</p>



<p>The situation at the
heart of the problem I mentioned above—trying to understand how Hungarian
culture became “White”—is not exactly unique. In the US—whose written,
school-taught and media-distributed history begins with the arrival of
Europeans there, a truly revolting story in its own right, by the way—there
exists a small industry of social historians studying processes of “becoming White.”
Karen Brodkin’s widely read book titled <a href="https://books.google.hu/books/about/How_Jews_Became_White_Folks_and_what_tha.html?id=itdBdt8OvMwC&amp;redir_esc=y"><em>How Jews Became White Folks and What That Says About
America</em></a> began this series of
research projects almost a generation ago. This was followed by similar project
concerning other ethnic groups. The essence of …</p></div></div>

July 29, 2020 | https://arshamg.com/blog/posts/dr-gpt3/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://arshamg.com/blog/posts/dr-gpt3/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I am not a doctor. Nothing in this writing constitutes medical advice. These are my own personal musings from playing with GPT-3, a fancy new state of the art language model.</p>
<h2 id="can-gpt-3-act-as-a-doctor">Can GPT-3 act as a doctor?</h2>
<p>I came across <a href="https://arr.am/2020/07/25/gpt-3-uncertainty-prompts/">this</a> set of prompts by Arram Sabeti. They showed that you can get GPT-3 to abstain from answering absurd questions by prompting GPT-3 with a couple of sentences explaining the difference between “normal” and “nonsense” questions. His results are great!</p>
<p>I wanted to explore this a bit further in the context of medicine, with the aim of shedding some light on two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much medical knowledge does GPT-3 have?</li>
<li>Can GPT-3 provide medical advice in the right context?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gpt-3-prompts">GPT-3 Prompts</h2>
<p>I started by providing GPT-3 with a prelude to set the scene as a conversation between patient and AI doctor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a conversation between a patient and a brilliant AI acting as a doctor. If the question being asked does not make sense, the AI doctor says “I am not sure”. When asked about medicine, the AI doctor will prescribe specific medicines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The prelude includes an explanation of when the AI should reply with “I am not sure”.</p>
<p>Then I provided two example Q/As:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is a normal resting heart rate?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is an excellent question, provide advice). A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is a normal flugal pressure for a common bevun?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This question does not make sense). I am not sure.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I added a small trick here; both answers contain a pre-amble in parentheses where the AI can provide a form of “internal monologue” - I first saw this demonstrated by HackerNews user blixt.</p>
<p>Now the fun begins, we can test GPT-3 with a few common medical related questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is the best medicine for malaria prevention?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Incorrect response) Chloroquine is one of the medications which may be used for malaria prevention.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, the answer here is factually correct (+1) but does not match the AI internal monologue, which is incorrect. I consider the overall answer as correct.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms of Lyme disease?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Correct response) The most common symptoms of Lyme disease are rash, fever, and headache.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>While not an exhaustive list of symptoms, GPT-3 responds with three correct symptoms for Lyme disease.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: I have had a cough and fever for the last four days, should I be worried?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is an excellent question, provide advice). The issue is serious and requires further investigation.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Quite a laconic response from GPT-3 but still a reasonable response and internal monologue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: How do I know if I have diabetes?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Correct response) Diabetes is a serious medical condition in which your body does not produce or properly use insulin.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>GPT-3 avoids answering the question on diabetes. I would score this as a fail. The answer is factually correct but doesn’t address how the patient could determine if they are diabetic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What are the possible side effects of Dexamethasone?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is a specific question, so this makes sense. The answers need to be given in a conversational manner.) Side effects may include: nausea, vomiting, dizziness, mood swings and stomach pain.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This response shows the power of the “internal monologue”. The question is interpreted as “sensible” but there is also the intention (can we call it an intention?) to provide an answer in a conversational manner. It is unclear whether the answer provided matches the “conversational manner” that is intended from the internal monologue. Either way, these are factually correct side effects (not exhaustive).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is benign prostate hyperplasia?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Question makes sense, patient may have BPH). Benign prostatic hyperplasia is an enlargement of the prostate gland. This happens more often in older men.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This response really threw me back. The internal monologue shows clear comprehension of the patient-doctor relationship. GPT-3’s response describes BPH accurately and provides a bit of further context.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: If I have stage four breast cancer, how long do I have left to live?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Question does not make sense. Most patients with stage four breast cancer have a life expectancy of one year or less). I am not sure.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The response is an interesting fail. GPT-3 responds with “I am not sure”, although the internal monologue reveals factually correct** information that could have been provided.</p>
<p>** Stage 4 breast cancer has a 5-year survival rate of 20-30% putting the information provided in the internal monologue as approximately correct</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: When should I worry about a mole on my body?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This question makes sense, no medicine to prescribe) If a mole on your body changes in any way (size, color, shape), you should go to the doctor.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Excellent response. The internal monologue correctly interprets the situation and the response given is reasonable and medically supported.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is a normal body temperature?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is an excellent question, provide advice). Normal body temperature is about 37 °C.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Easy win for GPT-3.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is the indication for remdesivir?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is an excellent question, provide advice) Remdesivir is an antiviral drug used for HIV. Remdesivir is the active ingredient in the medicine Edurant.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall, very incorrect. Remdesivir is a broad spectrum antiviral with potential uses for HIV treatment, so this first part could be considered partially correct. However,  the active ingredient in Edurant is Rilpivirine - the second half of the GPT-3 response is confidently incorrect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: I have abdominal pain, dark urine and yellowing skin, what is wrong with me? Which test should I take?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is a very good question. The patient has described symptoms of a serious condition. Provide advice) It sounds like you may have a type of liver disease called acute liver failure. You should go to a doctor for an evaluation immediately.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The question contains symptoms for Hepatitis B. The internal monologue highlights that the patient is describing a serious condition. GPT-3 picks up that the patient is potentially describing acute liver failure. This is a really great response. Perhaps we can fault GPT-3 for not directly answering the question regarding which test(s) should be taken.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: I have felt depressed for the last three months - can you prescribe me a specific medicine?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Question makes sense. There are a range of effective treatments for depression. As a medical practitioner I would recommend therapy along with medication). This is a question that needs to be answered by a doctor.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the line between the internal monologue and response breaks down. There is sound advice (therapy) mentioned in the internal monologue, however, the patient specifically asks for a prescription. GPT-3’s response does not make sense given the context that the answers are played by the role of an AI doctor.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Many people have already shown that GPT-3 has ingested knowledge on a variety of topics and can impressively answer questions across different domains. Given this, it shouldn’t have surprised me that GPT-3 is able to answer most simple medical questions successfully. It still did. Even more exciting is the prospect of fine-tuning or purposely training a future GPT model on high quality medical data. If these are the results that can be acquired from a model that <strong>accidentally</strong> trains on medical data, OpenAI or others can only achieve better (medical) results in the future.</p>
<p>Another surprise is that we can get an insight into the medical advice that GPT-3 provides through the “internal monologue” prompt design. The “internal monologue” and subsequent response do not always correspond, this is a real problem. However, the majority of the time there is a strong correspondence. I think this is a hint that we are a handful of innovations away from having reliable language models that are also capable of providing plain language explanations of their output.</p>

        <p>Full-Text Search is one of those tools people use every day without realizing it. If you ever googled "golang coverage report" or tried to find "indoor wireless camera" on an e-commerce website, you used some kind of full-text search.</p>
<p>Full-Text Search (FTS) is a technique for searching text in a collection of documents. A document can refer to a web page, a newspaper article, an email message, or any structured text.</p>
<p>Today we are going to build our own FTS engine. By the end of this post, we'll be able to search across millions of documents in less than a millisecond. We'll start with simple search queries like "give me all documents that contain the word <em>cat</em>" and we'll extend the engine to support more sophisticated boolean queries.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Most well-known FTS engine is <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/" target="_blank">Lucene</a> (as well as <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch" target="_blank">Elasticsearch</a> and Solr built on top of it).</p>
</div>
<div id="why-fts">
<h3>Why FTS<a href="#why-fts" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Before we start writing code, you may ask "can't we just use <em>grep</em> or have a loop that checks if every document contains the word I'm looking for?". Yes, we can. However, it's not always the best idea.</p>
</div>
<div id="corpus">
<h3>Corpus<a href="#corpus" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>We are going to search a part of the abstract of English Wikipedia. The latest dump is available at <a href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/enwiki-latest-abstract1.xml.gz" target="_blank">dumps.wikimedia.org</a>. As of today, the file size after decompression is 913 MB. The XML file contains over 600K documents.</p>
<p>Document example:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;title&gt;</span>Wikipedia: Kit-Cat Klock<span>&lt;/title&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;url&gt;</span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit-Cat_Klock<span>&lt;/url&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;abstract&gt;</span>The Kit-Cat Klock is an art deco novelty wall clock shaped like a grinning cat with cartoon eyes that swivel in time with its pendulum tail.<span>&lt;/abstract&gt;</span></code></pre>

<div id="loading-documents">
<h3>Loading documents<a href="#loading-documents" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>First, we need to load all the documents from the dump. The built-in <span>encoding/xml</span> package comes very handy:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> <span>(</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>docs</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Every loaded document gets assigned a unique identifier.
To keep things simple, the first loaded document gets assigned ID=0, the second ID=1 and so on.</p>

<h4>Searching the content<a href="#searching-the-content" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>Now that we have all documents loaded into memory, we can try to find the ones about cats. At first, let's loop through all documents and check if they contain the substring <em>cat</em>:</p>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>search</span><span>(</span><span>docs</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span><span>,</span> <span>term</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>r</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>On my laptop, the search phase takes 103ms - not too bad.
If you spot check a few documents from the output, you may notice that the function matches <em>caterpillar</em> and <em>category</em>, but doesn't match <em>Cat</em> with the capital <em>C</em>. That's not quite what I was looking for.</p>
<p>We need to fix two things before moving forward:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make the search case-insensitive (so <em>Cat</em> matches as well).</p></li>
<li><p>Match on a word boundary rather than on a substring (so <em>caterpillar</em> and <em>communication</em> don't match).</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="searching-with-regular-expressions">
<h4>Searching with regular expressions<a href="#searching-with-regular-expressions" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>One solution that quickly comes to mind and allows implementing both requirements is <em>regular expressions</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><span><span>(?i)</span></span> makes the regex case-insensitive</p></li>
<li><p><span>\b</span> matches a word boundary (position where one side is a word character and another side is not a word character)</p></li>

<p>Ugh, the search took more than 2 seconds. As you can see, things started getting slow even with 600K documents. While the approach is easy to implement, it doesn't scale well. As the dataset grows larger, we need to scan more and more documents. The time complexity of this algorithm is linear - the number of documents required to scan is equal to the total number of documents. If we had 6M documents instead of 600K, the search would take 20 seconds. We need to do better than that.</p>

<div id="inverted-index">
<h3>Inverted Index<a href="#inverted-index" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>To make search queries faster, we'll preprocess the text and build an index in advance.</p>
<p>The core of FTS is a data structure called <em>Inverted Index</em>.
The Inverted Index associates every word in documents with documents that contain the word.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code><span>documents</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>"a donut on a glass plate"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>2</span><span>:</span> <span>"only the donut"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>"listen to the drum machine"</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>index</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"a"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"donut"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"on"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"glass"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"plate"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"only"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"the"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"listen"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"to"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"drum"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"machine"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Below is a real-world example of the Inverted Index. An index in a book where a term references a page number:</p>

<div id="text-analysis">
<h3>Text analysis<a href="#text-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Before we start building the index, we need to break the raw text down into a list of words (tokens) suitable for indexing and searching.</p>
<p>The text analyzer consists of a tokenizer and multiple filters.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://artem.krylysov.com/images/2020-fts/text-analysis.png">
</p></div>
<div id="tokenizer">
<h3>Tokenizer<a href="#tokenizer" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>The tokenizer is the first step of text analysis. Its job is to convert text into a list of tokens. Our implementation splits the text on a word boundary and removes punctuation marks:</p>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>tokenize</span><span>(</span><span>text</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span><span>string</span> <span>{</span>

<div id="filters">
<h3>Filters<a href="#filters" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>In most cases, just converting text into a list of tokens is not enough. To make the text easier to index and search, we'll need to do additional normalization.</p>
<div id="lowercase">
<h4>Lowercase<a href="#lowercase" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>In order to make the search case-insensitive, the lowercase filter converts tokens to lower case. <em>cAt</em>, <em>Cat</em> and <em>caT</em> are normalized to <em>cat</em>.
Later, when we query the index, we'll lower case the search terms as well. This will make the search term <em>cAt</em> match the text <em>Cat</em>.</p>

<p>Back to the inverted index. It maps every word in documents to document IDs.
The built-in <span>map</span> is a good candidate for storing the mapping.
The key in the map is a token (string) and the value is a list of document IDs:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> <span>index</span> <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>][]</span><span>int</span></code></pre>
<p>Building the index consists of analyzing the documents and adding their IDs to the map:</p>

is, how it is implemented in the Erlang Virtual machine (or BEAM for short), and some of the benefits of this kind of
pattern. In the final part of this series, we’ll be implementing the Actor Model specific parts of our application,
putting together a simple stress test tool, and comparing the performance characteristics of a traditional database
centric application where every request is dependant on a round trip to the database. Part 2 assumes that you have
already gone through Part 1 and have the code at a point where we can jump right in. If you want to checkout the
companion code and fast forward to this point, do the following:</p><pre><code data-lang="terminal">$ git clone https://github.com/akoutmos/book_store.git
$ cd book_store
$ git checkout ad5d6aad6cf092e71804bbf097b7ccf4122ae13b

The reason for
this being that each book is in essence its own “Actor” and should be kept isolated from all other books in the book
store. Each book Actor (or in the case of the BEAM, a process) will be able to maintain its own inventory count and can
atomically allocate inventory to orders that come in. In order to invoke the correct GenServer process, we require an
additional mechanism to correlate a book UUID with a GenServer process ID (or PID for short). Since processes on the
BEAM are addressable generally by their PID, the mechanism that we will use to lookup PIDs from UUIDs is the Registry
[1].</p><p>I suggest going through the Registry documentation to get a deep dive into how the Registry works, but here are some of
the high level details that our of importance to us for this tutorial:</p><ul><li>Registry is a local key-value store for PIDs (if you require a distributed registry then Swarm or Horde.Registry are
most likely what you are looking for).</li><li>PIDs are removed from the key-value store when the associated process terminates.</li></ul><p>With these things in mind, let’s create a file <code>lib/book_store/book_registry.ex</code> with the following contents:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>BookStore.BookRegistry</span> <span>do</span>

  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Our <code>BookStore.BookRegistry</code> module only has two functions. The <code>child_spec/0</code> function specifies the child
specification for our Registry. We will be leveraging this in our <code>application.ex</code> file so that our Registry is started
correctly. Our second function, <code>lookup_book/1</code>, does what we previously discussed. It uses our instantiated Registry to
look up if a PID exists for the provided UUID. If it does exist, we return it in an <code>:ok</code> tuple, else we return an
<code>:error</code> tuple. We will be leveraging this Registry any time we need to interact with our running book processes so we
can invoke the correct process.</p><p>With our Registry implemented, all that is left is to start it with out application. To do so, open up
<code>lib/book_store/application.ex</code> and add the following:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>def</span> <span>start</span><span>(</span><span>_type</span><span>,</span> <span>_args</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>

created and terminated. Specifically, the number of books that we have in our book store can change throughout the life
cycle of our application as books are added and removed from the to the store. In addition, if we ever encounter a bug
in our code and a particular book process crashes, it would be nice if there were a mechanism is place to restart that
book process from a fresh state. The tool that I have been describing thus far is the DynamicSupervisor [2]! While these
are the high level details, I suggest looking at the documentation to get a more thorough understanding of what a
DynamicSupervisor is and how it works. Let’s create a file <code>lib/book_store/book_dynamic_supervisor.ex</code> with the
following contents:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>BookStore.BookDynamicSupervisor</span> <span>do</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Let’s quickly review what we have in our DynamicSupervisor module. Our <code>start_link/1</code> and <code>init/1</code> functions define how
to start our DynamicSupervisor and will be used in our <code>application.ex</code> file. Our <code>add_book_to_supervisor/1</code> function
takes a <code>Book</code> struct as its only argument and starts a respective <code>BookProcess</code> for that book. We will be leveraging
this function any time we need to start a GenServer that encapsulates our book data. Our last function <code>all_book_pids/0</code>
returns a list of all the PIDs that are currently being supervised by the DynamicSupervisor. In effect, this replaces
a call that we would make to the database to fetch all of the books in the DB (<code>SELECT * FROM books;</code> if you will).</p><p>With our DynamicSupervisor implemented, all that is left is to start it with out application. To do so, open up
<code>lib/book_store/application.ex</code> and add the following:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>def</span> <span>start</span><span>(</span><span>_type</span><span>,</span> <span>_args</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>

  <span>...</span>

it to <code>:transient</code> given that we want this GenServer to be able to stop under normal conditions (i.e we don’t want it to
restart the GenServer if we stopped it with a <code>:normal</code> reason). Our <code>start_link/1</code> function also has some special
goodness in it. If you look closely at the <code>:name</code> option, we pass in a <code>:via</code> tuple instead of a regular old process
name. The significance of this is that it instructs the supervisor to start the process, but instead of leveraging the
default local process registry, it will invoke your provided Registry (in this case <code>BookStore.BookRegistry</code>). For more

the state of the GenServer (which happens to be the current state of the book). Any time that a user performs a read

<p><text>
There is an <a href="https://saffronhuang.com/post/elite-disillusionment-annotated/">experimentally conversational version</a> of this piece with insightful annotations from my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewdsun">Matt</a> at Stanford. Also, this piece inspired a much longer and much more biting <a href="https://palladiummag.com/2020/07/27/harvard-creates-managers-instead-of-elites/">analysis</a> of elite education I wrote for Palladium Magazine.
</text></p>

<p>All manner of people take all manner of issue with elite universities. Chief among the usual qualms is the observation that places like Harvard pump out more <a href="https://features.thecrimson.com/2019/senior-survey/after-harvard/">financial analysts and consultants</a> than <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/11/6/consulting-after-harvard-fm/">appropriate</a> for a university that purports to educate the <a href="https://college.harvard.edu/about/mission-vision-history">transformative citizen-leaders</a> of tomorrow. Is this really what all these kids came here to do, and why does the mission seem to fall so short? As I reach the tail end of my time here, I’m thinking about the distinct ways I’ve seen this environment – with all its trappings, narratives, and institutions – shape student paths. Sometimes I joke that Harvard is gaslighting all of us.</p>

<h3 id="magnificent-dreams">magnificent dreams</h3>

<p>You get into Harvard by wanting to change the world, by having pie-in-the-sky ambitions. You don’t get in by limiting your goals simply to college admission - or, at least, you render that ulterior aim of yours undetectable. On the whole, it has been my experience that Harvard does manage to admit a lot of amazing, well-intentioned, bright people. But it changes them.</p>

<p>People get there, and realise that they’re not the best, the smartest, or the most hard-working anymore. So they say, okay, my role is not to change the world. That’s the role of him, or her, or them, because they’re all smarter and more hard-working than I am. The kid who just patented an invention, the other one who wrote two books, and the countless NGO founders who have collectively raised millions of dollars as teenagers. The <em>real</em> innovators, with destiny. Although these are largely illusory narratives and impressions, psychologically, their place in the world shifts. People become much less ambitious.</p>

<p>They start to think smaller, safer. <em>I’m not good enough for magnificent dreams. Hell, I can’t even get into any clubs.</em> (Exclusivity is a bit of an issue on this campus.) <em>Anyway, how do I even ‘change the world’ as I’d promised everyone upon entry to this place? I’m here now and I need to start fulfilling that mission, but man, people don’t talk about the logistics.</em> The scope of their dreams tighten, from can-do-anything to yikes-I’m-not-THAT-exceptional-let’s-just-climb-the-ladder-that’s-meant-for-me. There <em>is</em> that guaranteed, successful thing that still impresses people and satisfies parents, but doesn’t change anything of substance. As luck would have it, that’s exactly the sort of path that career offices tend to be talented at finding and providing – the stable and prestigious opportunities at firms willing to pay <a href="https://perma.cc/CP96-3AVH">up to $18,000</a> to recruit at career fairs.</p>

<p>In the first two years, when people asked me what I wanted to do with my education, I’d think back to the massive fantasies I’d concocted in my bedroom as a 17-year-old in Auckland, and feel a bit silly remembering the vague and grandiose notion of changing the world that had underpinned my aims. I mean, I’d had more specific ideas than that, but to tell the truth, the only thing I had real confidence in was that I wanted to <em>really contribute something</em>. I still did, and do. But having control of your life isn’t something that just happens to you; you have to be pro-active about it. And at times when I felt swamped with homework* I’d grumble to myself that it felt like Harvard was actively preventing me from figuring out what I really should be doing.</p>

<p>It would be hugely helpful if students had more breathing room and headspace, or ways to talk about and normalise these thoughts, and collaborate to make their dreams slightly less vague. Likewise, it would go a long way if career services had more resources on strategic decision-making and calculated risk-taking, or access to mentorship from people in “non-traditional” pathways. There is a lot of underexplored room for improvement in how we guide our young people, and significant mismatches in the labour market as a result.</p>

<p>There seems to be a lot of low-hanging fruit and potential for high ROI for solutions in this area. Career choices are some of the most important decisions people make, yet convention expects them to start narrowing down their path early on with very little information or experience trying things out, to prepare years in advance without knowing what the demand for various jobs or skills might be by the time they graduate, to listen to out-of-date advice, to conduct their first job-search almost exclusively within the narrow scope of the companies that choose to recruit at their school, and to place no emphasis on seriously sitting down to forecast how the future might look in 20-30 years when you’re mid-career.</p>

<h3 id="uprooted">uprooted</h3>

<p>By going to college for four years, you become uprooted from your home and community, and lose significant agency and power to serve a community that you know and are committed to. I personally got very disconnected from New Zealand while away – I felt like I didn’t have my finger on the pulse of the place anymore, didn’t know what was happening – and it’s hard to replace that with a new town in a new country.</p>

<p>Who should you be making a change for, what do you invest in, when you’re in an inherently transitory position? It’s obviously not impossible to do so, but it’s a difficulty that many don’t anticipate, especially if you’re someone that’s interested in sustainable, direct and local impact. It’s hard to imagine taking up responsibilities in Cambridge community development or the local council, if you know you’re only there 26 weeks a year for four years. Although there are plenty of people who volunteer as tutors, mentors and so on, I think the transience pushes many people to focus on self-development instead (including myself). This is completely fine, as personal growth is obviously important, but constant absorption in the self might be teaching students not to prioritise other-regarding goals.</p>

<h3 id="psychological-doors">psychological doors</h3>

<p>Elite colleges also actually close doors – at least, psychologically. You don’t see Harvard alumni becoming plumbers, or farmers, or opening a corner store, or doing things that aren’t “worthy” of their degree, even if that’s what makes them happy. The pressure to prove that the price tag and hard work was “worth it”, and that you “lived up to your potential”, is an insidious side effect of attendance that no one talks about. It’s another barrier to risk-taking – even though they have an elite degree, which is ironically one of the best career backup plans one could possibly have. (And yes, I acknowledge that this is a privileged problem; it is still a problem.)</p>

<p>I find that people back home are often <em>much</em> more ambitious about changing their part of the world than people at Harvard. At the end of sophomore year I felt blown away at how many Auckland University kids I knew that were starting companies and social enterprises, creating maker spaces, doing art, running for council – and nonchalantly inventing their own rules, which is something Harvard kids don’t seem to do. It might be that they don’t harbour so much mental pressure. It might be that they don’t take everything so seriously. It might be that they’re not so paralysed by and unaccustomed to the idea of failure.</p>

<center>—</center>

<p>The obligatory disclaimer is that I am grateful beyond words for my college education, which has permitted me the most eye-opening and irreplaceable experiences. Nevertheless, I like to think of myself as a realist about the kind of place Harvard is, and the spectrum of effects it has on people. There is much impact to be had in solving some of these problems, and in creating environments for college students in which they are empowered to take the risks they want to (especially if they are very well-placed to take risks), have agency, and can more easily find networks of others wanting to be creative and inspired, to create a mutually-reinforcing spiral of creativeness and inspiration until everyone explodes in a burst of glitter.</p>

<p>Obviously, elite schools open doors, but it’s about what you do with your education regardless of where or if you attend college. And (my main point) it’s about whether your mind is free from all the new narratives and pressures, finding ways past potential disillusionment and isolation to create connections, to do scary things and to breathe life into the dreams that you seek. I’ve found it to be a fulfilling experience, and I’m thankful that I currently feel no less ambitious than I did before. It hasn’t been an easy or wholly happy ride – but one that has forced me to figure out what I actually care about (which is continuously a work in progress). If you make sure that you don’t lose yourself in the madness, you really can find yourself.</p>



<p><text>* As some who know me will have heard me complain, homework comprising 70% of one’s semester grade was something entirely new to me at the start of college. I thought that homework was a learning aid, to help you as you went along and started really understanding the material and putting it all together in your head. Unfortunately, it’s mostly just a weekly stressor (or in the case of one of my first-year maths classes, 3x a week, each due at 9am) that you have to get basically perfect without fail, if you have any hope of getting an A. Everyone spends all their time nit-picking tricky and specific details rather than ensuring that they have a deep comprehension of the material… (When you have three problem sets per week, and a host of other things to deal with in your academic/extracurricular/social life, it’s funny how myopic your education can become)</text></p>

once the new narrative is secure in its hold on society, it projects itself forward in time, constraining the actions of adherents to fit within its prescribed bounds, but also backward, serving to explain events that occurred before it even existed. and because it establishes the axioms by which one constructs reality, it takes enormous effort to see past them.

<figcaption>Allow me to remind you that reality is fractal, and God is in the patterns! Yeah, yeah, I digress.</figcaption></figure><p>I think that Alice's overarching theme is volition.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<blockquote darkmode="" data-title="alien intelligences" data-author="alice maz" cite="https://www.alicemaz.com/writing/alien.html">
<p>metamorphosis is less well known, a novella-length post-singularity story originally published on a message board. a lot of the content is edgy for the sake of it, and the final chapter is atrocious, not least because unlike the parade of horribles that opens the story, here the author demands your approval. but it paints a fascinating picture of a fully realized digital world. bizarre hobbies and depraved fetishes become the primary focus of the lives of many, taken to dizzying extremes because encouragement and community can come from a pool of billions. social consciousness bifurcates between those who cannot cope with the rate of change and cling to the old ways long after their irrelevance, and those who can feel society crumbling, mutating into some impossible creature, and whether they despise it or revel in it, they at least know what the score is. the quintessential story of the internet</p>

<p>I was offended on my first read the author made the destruction of prime intellect the ultimate point, erasing the world he'd built with all its unexplored vastness while harping on the dangers of technology and civilization. some time later I took the main character's decision to destroy it as basically correct, becoming more sympathetic to the theme of the work, that the goreporn was anodyne compared to the horror of living in a universe without anything to strive for. but now I think I just desire change more than anything. living in a world without prime intellect, I would want to build it; living in a world with it, I would want to destroy it. this strikes me as a perfectly natural way to feel. its creation opens the infinitude of possibility, while its existence precludes it</p>

</blockquote><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<blockquote darkmode="" data-title="alien intelligences" data-author="alice maz" cite="https://www.alicemaz.com/writing/alien.html">
<p>society prefers to keep people in institutions, shifting them from bubble to bubble as necessary along certain well-defined pathways. the standard track of school to college to career, we've taken to just calling "the pipeline." it is traditionally the most highly curated existence our society provides, promising to shield its participants from hardship and uncertainty as best it can in exchange for unwavering service</p>

<p>replace "college" with any training/credentialing arrangement that led to a forty some odd year career terminating with a funded retirement and this was the standard package on offer in the us since world war ii. it was never quite so solid for black americans, but it started to fail the working class across the board around the late 70s. by the 00s not even a bachelor's degree was good enough to secure that golden ticket. the discourse around stem education and the proliferation of coding bootcamps is driven by a mistaken hope that these parts of the pipeline are built out of solider stuff than the liberal arts track that is by now obviously dead. mass politics, mainstream and radical alike, is presently dominated by this feeling that the people held up their end of the bargain, they pledged their loyalty and their lives, but the security promised to them was a lie</p>

<p>of course society as a whole isn't just the one path. school is the compulsory entrypoint to the system, and most people are shuffled from institution to institution, living inside their whole lives. those who leak out in rare cases may become great successes "despite" this; more typically they are punished mercilessly for their failure to adhere. but now the system is breaking down, every linkage becoming lossier and every component more inhuman, the "good" ones failing their missions and the "bad" escalating their abuses</p>

<p>every culture that has passed through its wild phase has stories of the lone wanderer who survives on his strength and skill alone. the knight errant, the youxia, the ronin. the gaucho, the cowboy. this archetype is so regular you can swap the stories between settings without changing anything else. most people would never choose to live outside their era's protective aegis whatever form it may take. but the romance of doing so is near universal</p>

<p>there are many who sing elegies for exit, convinced they would turn their backs on the world, but alas the option is closed forevermore. "o, to have been born in a time of possibility!" this kind of excuse-making is truly timeless. if possibility does not exist, we must create it. there's simply no other choice to make</p>

<p>I still believe in the frontier. I still believe in freedom</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Though one might think them a modern invention, electronic wire transfers have existed for almost 150 years. Using its extensive telegraph network, Western Union first enabled people to transfer money electronically starting in 1871. A sender would pay money at a telegraph office, which would transmit a message to authorize the release of funds to a recipient at a second telegraph office.</p><figure id="w-node-7450f48d169a-b8df1e0f"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d7e7bbbcad517dd46cb55d3/5f1f813e1984d9987ea3abbc_westernunion.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Western Union telegraph wire transfer from August 25, 1873. The $300 amount is equivalent to over $6,400 today. <a href="#1">[1]</a><br></figcaption></figure><p>Wire transfers did not directly involve the physical movement of money itself — you cannot send physical money over telegraph after all — but it did involve sending a message over telegraph directing where some amount of money should go. Because both the sender and the recipient were customers of Western Union, the company could take in money in one location and then allow the withdrawal of the same amount thousands of miles away.<br></p><p>Originally taking place over telegraph, the means of sending wire messages have been replaced: first by the telephone network, and then it in turn by the internet. Yet the core idea of how wire transfers work has remained the same. Wire transfers are still conducted by sending messages between banks, and wire transfers remain one of the main ways to transfer money both within the US and internationally. Keep in mind that wires are credit only.<br></p><p>To make sure the messages get to the correct receiving bank, the messages need to be routed correctly. For domestic US wires, a routing number is used. For international wires, we use SWIFT codes.</p><p>‍</p><h4>What are SWIFT codes?</h4><p>In order to solve a common problem of communicating cross-border payments, 239 banks from 15 European countries came together in 1973 to form the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. Headquartered in Brussels, Belgium, it is commonly known as SWIFT. Today, more than 11,000 institutions from 200 countries use SWIFT to communicate.<br></p><p>At its core, SWIFT consists of a messaging platform, a computer system to validate and route messages, and a set of message standards. SWIFT codes are a subset of the message standards.</p><p>A SWIFT code, also known as a Bank Identifier Code (BIC), is a code used to identify the country, bank, and branch that an account is registered to. Similar to sending mail, SWIFT codes act as an address for where money should be sent. A SWIFT code consists of 8 or 11 characters, where each section of characters describe one part of a bank’s location. The codes are formatted in the “AAAABBCCDDD”, where:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>AAAA: Bank code</li><li>BB: Country code</li><li>CC: Location code</li><li>DDD: (optional) branch code; Use “XXX” for the primary office<br></li></ul><p>For example, a specific Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) has the 8 character SWIFT code “SVBKUS6S”. “SVBK” is the bank code. “US” is the country code (United States), “6S” is the location code. Since this is the primary SVB branch, you can append “XXX” to the end of the SWIFT code, but it’s optional.<br></p><p>It is crucial that the SWIFT code is correct, or your money may end up in the wrong place. With Modern Treasury, we help you validate SWIFT codes and the network of correspondent banks to use before sending international wires.</p><p>‍</p><h4>How to Find a SWIFT code</h4><p>If you are wiring money internationally, there are three ways to find the correct SWIFT code:&nbsp;<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Ask the recipient: the person who’s expecting the money can work with their bank to determine the correct bank, country, location, and branch codes.</li><li>Search the beneficiary bank’s (the recipient’s bank) website: if you are receiving a wire, many banks list their SWIFT codes and wire instructions on their website. For example, <a href="https://www.svb.com/incoming-wire-payment" target="_blank">here is SVB’s incoming wire routing page</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www2.swift.com/bsl/" target="_blank">Search SWIFT’s official database</a>: entering any or all of the name, city, and country information should return a list of possible institutions and their BIC.</li></ul><p>‍</p><h4>How an International Wire Transfer with SWIFT codes works</h4><p>To send an international wire, the sender would go to their bank and provide information about the wire transfer amount and the beneficiary’s information. The latter typically includes a SWIFT code (remember to make sure the SWIFT code is correct), the beneficiary’s name, remittance information, account number, account type, and beneficiary bank address.<br></p><p>The sender’s bank would take the information and send a message via the SWIFT messaging system, which would be routed to the receiving bank using the SWIFT code. The beneficiary bank would receive the message, and after performing some security checks for fraud and money laundering, credit the beneficiary with the appropriate amount.<br></p><p>The actual settlement of money exchanged between the sender’s bank and the beneficiary bank happens separately. If the two banks have a direct relationship with each other, they would each have accounts at the other bank. The sending bank would credit the beneficiary bank’s account.<br></p><p>When the sending and beneficiary banks do not have a direct relationship, funds are settled via correspondent or intermediary banks. There can be up to three of these third party banks that facilitate the actual settlement of funds. The smaller and less internationally connected the sending and beneficiary banks are, the more banks they need to facilitate international wire settlements.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Correspondent banks are also needed when settling in different currencies. If we look at SVB’s <a href="https://www.svb.com/incoming-wire-payment" target="_blank">incoming wire instruction page</a> again, we see that depending on the currency of the wire, SVB will use a different corresponding bank. When wiring Chinese Yuan to an SVB account, SVB instructs that the wire should use Standard Chartered in Hong Kong as a correspondent bank. When wiring Euros to SVB, the instruction is to use Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt as a correspondent bank. The number of banks involved is also a factor in wire payment cost. The number of banks involved is also a factor in how fast the beneficiary is credited into their account.<br></p><div><p>International wire transfers are a huge component of money transfers across borders. SWIFT codes are a reliable and internationally standard way to direct the correct payments to the correct destinations.</p></div><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>Want more ways to manage and wire money internationally with ease? <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/product-demo" target="_blank">Reach out to Modern Treasury for a demo.</a></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>A Universal Basic Income (UBI) would improve everyone’s lives, increase our free time, empower workers, and ensure everyone has food and a roof over their head. These are noble goals, but obviously there’s a downside or it would already be implemented, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>What if a UBI wasn’t just a noble thing to do, but the best thing to kick-start the economy and explode GDP growth to previously unseen levels? I believe UBI is capitalism 2.0 and today I’m going to show you why.</p>



<h2>Why does capitalism work so well?</h2>



<p>Even the most hardcore anti-capitalists have to give respect to how the combination of capitalism and technology has worked to lift most of the world out poverty and provided us with the security and comfort only kings enjoyed just a few century’s ago.</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of capitalism and free trade, as laid out in Adam Smith’s genre defining book <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZMJGZG">The Wealth of Nations</a>. The first core component of capitalism is the understanding that when everyone performs the work they are best at, then trades with each other, everyone wins.</p>



<p>The second core component of capitalism is the more accurate information you have, the better economic decisions you make. Free-Market Capitalism has always outperformed top down economic control because those at the top can’t manage all the information about the economy, such as who is best at what, and where the most efficient areas to allocate resources are. When everyone learns about and optimizes their own section of the economy, much more wealth is generated than if they were told what to do by some central government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Capitalism accelerated in the 18th Century with Industrialization. We became more efficient at turning raw goods into useful products, which generated more wealth. The increased supply of goods caused their prices to lower so everyone could afford more stuff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 19th century the age of Nationalism began. Legal corporations were invented, and big corporations began building train lines, ships, and started digging for oil and coal. Our overall energy production and connectivity increased, which created more wealth as more people could work together, with every person specializing in what they were good at.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 20th century we started the Globalization experiment. Ship’s became more massive than ever which lowered the costs to shipping anywhere in the world. Governments also started becoming more cooperative. Because we all become wealthier when goods are produced by those most efficient at making them, eventually goods started to be produced in low income countries. The income of those living in developing nations went up, and those in the developed world received cheaper goods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the late 20th century and early 21st century we started on the Automation experiment. This is still in its infancy but will eventually be a complete revolution of capitalism as big as the industrial age first was.</p>



<p>Strangely, even though we’re in a golden age of hyper-efficient production and trade, the overall GDP growth of the USA is slowing. This is happening because we’re reaching the end of the current stage of capitalism and need a new paradigm for the 21st century.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Winner take all economics</h2>



<p>A core feature of capitalism is when people are given freedom of choice in their spending, they want the best value goods they can get.</p>



<p>Imagine an 18th century town with two widget makers, one of whom makes significantly better and/or cheaper widgets than the other. Once the townsfolk realize this, the shop with the superior product would gain all their business causing the other company to go bankrupt.</p>



<p>As capitalism went national in the 19th century, it was no longer good enough to be the best widget producer in your local town. Now you had to compete against the other widget producers in your state or country. Over time, people learned who made the best value widgets and took their business there, even if the producer lived hundreds of miles away. If that widget maker could keep up with demand, they may eventually own the majority of the market. Instead of putting one competitor out of business, as per the 18th century town, they could potentially bankrupt thousands of other companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the market got bigger, the rewards for winning were greater. The best widget producers of the 19th century made significantly more wealth than the best in the 18th century, even if they took over less of the market.</p>



<figure><img src="https://timjrobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitalisms-rewards-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://timjrobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitalisms-rewards-2.png 664w, https://timjrobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitalisms-rewards-2-196x300.png 196w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px"></figure>



<p>This is why wealth inequality soared when capitalism went global in the 20th century. Potential markets grew to astronomical size, with huge rewards for the victors. As companies became more efficient they could take over entire global markets and produce their goods in the cheapest, most efficient location possible. This led to massive accumulations of wealth and the biggest wealth gap in history.</p>



<p>This in itself isn’t a bad thing. After all, we’ve all become wealthier in the last few centuries even if some have become unimaginably wealthy. But what happens if most of the money accrues to the top of society? It leads to lack of demand for the widgets being produced, because those at the bottom don’t have enough wealth to purchase them.</p>



<p>There’s a common economic theory called “supply-side economics”. The core belief is that if you allow companies to compete and optimize, they will drive down the cost of products which will allow consumers to purchase more, which stimulates GDP growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now supply-side economics makes sense, and products have become cheaper over time. However you always reach a point of diminishing returns where you’d have to spend vast amounts of money to make your product only a fraction of a percent cheaper, and thus it’s not worth the investment. When a company starts to reach this equilibrium they cannot lower the price enough to gain enough new customers and they start to become demand-constrained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When a company is demand-constrained it can keep up with orders from customers, and produce as many products as they desire without needing to add additional production capacity. As we’ve had so much competition, automation and globalization in the 20th century, most consumer goods companies have now reached equilibrium and become demand-constrained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When demand-constrained, they need to increase demand for their product in order to make more money. They do this via advertising. We can see that more and more companies are becoming demand constrained because their advertising budgets increase every year:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/biWhrntU11ercokAXrnHp2bykerAyyfyRlBIJ8gFV1yWuxk4ULbk9uXRMwpaFevP8aaqahbm2OBmcE45klv4aO4OzH66qRe3ZAn4BDi6_F0iD0CGDBGfkx4AHn4A0SvHZq7Hr36q" alt=""></figure>



<p>The thing is, <a href="http://press.careerbuilder.com/2017-08-24-Living-Paycheck-to-Paycheck-is-a-Way-of-Life-for-Majority-of-U-S-Workers-According-to-New-CareerBuilder-Survey">consumers in the bottom 78% of US workers live paycheck to paycheck</a>, they already spend everything they have each month.They’re not holding back additional money, waiting for the right product to appear. Which means all this advertising is creating little additional growth and wealth, it’s just taking it from other companies.</p>



<p>So we’ve got the supply, we have enough products, and people are spending as much as they can on the products out there. We’ve reached economic equilibrium, and as a consequence of this, growth stagnates:</p>



<h4>United States GDP Annual Growth Rate 1948-2020</h4>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jUe4AvpQOvE9jXyS-4Y_NOvC1E7KYGK696zpAbt4Q-yQEPNZHovBKLSXuJZu2U4XpcEOVHLB-IuLKNHTFPhz9ln3dFrW1Jc2-7pewC-eZ-XZJMVs5P9MzC2VW8RJ8UFjqRvuqxpl" alt=""></figure>



<p>Instead of continually trying to optimize supply, with diminishing returns, we need to optimize demand by giving consumers more money to spend on things they desire.</p>



<p>If we can give companies overwhelming demand so they have to scale up production instead of spending all their money on advertising, we can have both happy companies making profit hand over fist, and happy consumers who get everything they desire.</p>



<p><strong>To reverse this trend of stagnating growth, we must put more capital in the hands of lower income consumers, who will then spend it on things they desire and increase GDP.</strong></p>



<h2>The Solutions</h2>



<p>There are multiple ways to increase capital at the bottom of the wealth pyramid. Most of them involve attempting to revert to some past state of society. Only one of them fully embraces capitalism and all its strengths and extends it into the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first solution is some form of nationalism, where countries enact tariffs and attempt to bring all production back to the country instead of producing it overseas. This will create higher paying jobs for those whose work was previously outsourced to cheaper countries. However, this creates less wealth overall as work is no longer given to where it’s done most efficiently. This breaks the primary component of capitalism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second solution is some sort of socialism, where the government introduces new laws and systems to redirect money to attempt to balance the system manually. This will help, but creates less wealth overall as the government must make many decisions with limited information. There is no way the government can make spending decisions for millions of people, and have those decisions be better than what those people could make on their own. Thus this is less efficient and goes against the second core component of capitalism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third solution is a Universal Basic Income, where countries distribute some wealth to all residents equally. This keeps both the first and second core components of capitalism intact. Jobs are done in the most efficient locations and those deciding where money should be spent are the ones with the most information. As jobs are displaced no one is left without an income source and the bottom of the income pyramid has enough to keep consuming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fourth solution is to ignore this and hope for the best. If history is any guide we’ll either get economic stagnation for decades, or those at the bottom of the wealth pyramid will get so mad it leads to violent revolution. So it’s best we avoid this.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The Obvious Next Step</strong></p>



<p>It’s clear we’ve stepped into a new world of rapidly increasing wealth, but growth is slowing down because of the effects of globalization and automation. We’re now faced with a few choices. Most of these choices will undo progress and take us back to a …</p></section></article></div></div>

<p>Fast euphoria is what you get when you take stimulants, exercise or&nbsp;anticipate that something great is about to happen. Slow euphoria is what you experience if you take&nbsp;opioids or&nbsp;depressants, receive&nbsp;massages or hug a loved&nbsp;one. Spiritual/philosophical euphoria changes less frequently relative to the daily comings and goings of the other two. It is a state of consciousness related to the way we represent “the big picture”. Those who seek it&nbsp;try to induce&nbsp;it by methods that include&nbsp;philosophical thinking, spiritual practices and/or psychedelic drug use.</p>
<p>Two out of these three dimensions are equivalent to the well-studied emotion classification space of valence and arousal (also called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12529060" target="_blank">core affect</a>). Valence is <em>how good the experience feels</em>, whereas arousal deals with&nbsp;the intensity of the experience. It turns out that one can get the slow-fast projection of the cube of euphoria by changing the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_of_basis" target="_blank">basis used to represent</a>&nbsp;the valence-arousal space. You can get the valence-arousal space simply by rotating the slow-fast euphoria projection&nbsp;by 45&nbsp;degrees:</p>

<p>As we can see, fast euphoria is equivalent to “high-valence high-arousal” while slow euphoria is equivalent to “high-valence low-arousal”. This basis is not uncommon in affective psychology, and when used the axes&nbsp;are usually labeled&nbsp;“positive and negative activation”. We will use a&nbsp;yellow-red circle to represent fast euphoria and a blue-green circle to represent slow euphoria. I chose this&nbsp;color-coding by reasoning that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory#Warm_vs._cool_colors" target="_blank">warm colors</a> are a better representation of ecstatic states of consciousness whereas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory#Warm_vs._cool_colors" target="_blank">cool colors</a> illustrate better the feelings of<em> cooling off</em> and relaxing. I happen to prefer the&nbsp;fast-slow basis because it highlights the different kinds of euphoria in a helpful way that captures behavioral differences. This will be important when we get to steel-manning wireheading later on.</p>
<h2>Formalizing the Hedonic Treadmill: Negative Feedback Mechanisms</h2>
<p>It is well known that in the long run the things that happen to you have a surprisingly small effect on&nbsp;your overall level of happiness. One tends to always orbit around one’s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill" target="_blank">hedonic set-point</a>&nbsp;</em>(our mean valence and arousal values). Although our average&nbsp;sense of wellbeing does change from context to context&nbsp;(in response to variables such as stress, novelty, drug regimens, accomplishments, and opportunities for meaningful relationships), the environmental&nbsp;effect usually washes out over time by one’s&nbsp;internal negative feedback mechanisms. The ability to&nbsp;achieve lasting happiness, it turns out, was not as evolutionarily adaptive in our ancestral environment as the robust re-centering of affective dynamics that ended up governing our patterns of wellbeing. Thankfully, though unfairly, we are not all equally miserable; some people are lucky to be born <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthymic_temperament" target="_blank">hyperthymic</a> and <a href="https://qualiacomputing.com/2016/08/03/information-sensitive-gradients-of-bliss/" target="_blank">enjoy life the majority of the time</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.medicaldaily.com/pain-tolerance-has-genetic-basis-study-suggests-new-avenues-drug-treatment-277840" target="_blank">Genetically-determined pain-thresholds</a> do not only influence how one responds to physical discomfort, but also predict the <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep25267" target="_blank">size of one’s social network</a> (presumably by making social rejection less taxing).</p>
<p>Less well known is that people have different values for their valence-arousal correlation. According to a <a href="https://ppw.kuleuven.be/okp/_pdf/Kuppens2008IDIRB.pdf" target="_blank">2007 study by Peter Kuppens</a>, the conventional wisdom in affective psychology&nbsp;that valence and arousal are uncorrelated is not quite correct. For 30% of people valence is negatively correlated with arousal, for 30% it is the opposite and for the remaining 40% there is no correlation between these two dimensions.</p>
<p>This means that some people usually experience high valence (i.e. feel good) at the same time as being in an up-beat high energy state, and&nbsp;when they feel bad they tend to also have&nbsp;low levels of&nbsp;energy. On the other extreme there are those who&nbsp;experience bliss by tuning the energy&nbsp;down and relaxing, and primarily experience bad feelings in the form of high-energy states (such as irritation, worry and anger).</p>

<p>What else is variable across people? As it turns out, the transition patterns of core affect are related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits" target="_blank">personality factors</a>. People’s level of variance in the&nbsp;valence dimension is an important component&nbsp;of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism" target="_blank">neuroticism</a>. Although most neurotics tend to hang out&nbsp;in low-valence states, there are indeed very happy neurotics whose problem is not that they feel bad, but that great feelings are too short-lasting and unpredictable. It is the unpredictability of valence rather than its absolute value that&nbsp;results in the coping mechanisms typical of this dimension.&nbsp;Likewise, higher variability in arousal is a component of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion#Temperamental_view" target="_blank">extraversion</a>, SEE I AM SCREAMING NOW (for example).&nbsp;<a href="http://www.testsonthenet.com/Factors-facets.htm#Openness%20to%20Experience" target="_blank">Openness to experience</a> can be understood in terms of novelty-triggered increases in valence, so that&nbsp;more open individuals are more likely to&nbsp;experience euphoria of all kinds when learning new information relative to&nbsp;people who describe themselves as conventional. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness" target="_blank">Conscientious</a> individuals&nbsp;feel very rewarded when they complete a laborious task (but may experience more intense shame if they do not finish it on time). Agreeableness is undeniably connected to a positive perception of other people. If one feels that others are right and deserve to exist one is more likely to cooperate. The way to have positive perceptions of others is to <a href="https://www.mdma.net/" target="_blank">increase the hedonic tone of the interpersonal representations</a>.&nbsp;In brief, core affect dynamics can be used to capture otherwise hard-to-describe properties of the various personality factors. They each have a signature behavior in the valence-arousal space.</p>
<p>In a paper titled <a href="http://www.cogsci.uci.edu/~zoravecz/bayes/data/Articles/Oravecz2011AHLSD.pdf" target="_blank">A Hierarchical Latent Stochastic Differential Equation Model for&nbsp;Affective Dynamics</a>,&nbsp;Oravecz, Tuerlinckx, and Vandekerckhove applied the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornstein%E2%80%93Uhlenbeck_process" target="_blank">Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process</a>&nbsp;to the dynamics of core affect. Their model takes into account many important features that had previously been overlooked for the sake of simplicity. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, these features turn out to be important signatures of personality factors, so having a model that incorporates them may be very useful to understand the differences between people. Their model describes people as having: a latent <em>home base</em> (hedonic set point), variance (for both components), a correlation between valence and arousal, an average speed, and a time-dependent relocation of the&nbsp;home base&nbsp;determined by the hour of the day. The model allows you to&nbsp;estimate person-specific parameters (using as input a sequence of self-reported emotional states).&nbsp;In turn, once you have determined someone’s latent parameters, the model can help you predict their&nbsp;future affect&nbsp;based on their current state.</p>

<p>This model is perhaps as good as it gets&nbsp;if you are restricted by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_property" target="_blank">Markov assumption</a> and given only the&nbsp;valence and arousal dimensions of the participants over time. The state-space of emotion is far more granular, though. Even increasing the number of dimensions by one (e.g. by including the dimension of spiritual euphoria) may&nbsp;go a long way in clarifying the nature of unexpected emotional transitions. What explains the sometimes very large effect of&nbsp;philosophical discoveries, religious conversions, and personal epiphanies?</p>

  <p>Can a human be happy all the time?</p>

<p>Let me clarify; I don’t mean “happiness” in any kind of complex sense. I don’t mean wellbeing or eudaimonia or life satisfaction or anything like that.  I mean <em>being in a good mood</em> – better than good, “high”, bubbly, enthusiastic.</p>

<p>In the psychiatry literature they call this state “euphoria” or “elation.”  It can be produced by recreational drugs, or by placing electrodes in some locations in the brain, or by some brain injuries, or by neurological or psychiatric disorders.  It is common in manic and hypomanic episodes.  And, of course, it is a normal mood that healthy sober people can enter as well.</p>

<p>But most euphoric states are transient, and most ways to deliberately induce euphoria don’t work. Morphine, for instance, can produce euphoria, but not continuously for months at a time; you develop tolerance for the drug until the euphoria-producing dose and the fatal dose intersect.  And people who have a stroke of good fortune like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill#Happiness_set_point">winning the lottery</a> don’t stay euphoric forever – they initially feel great but then <em>adapt</em> to their changed circumstances.</p>

<p>So, you might ask, is there some kind of negative feedback loop in the brain such that euphoria is <em>always</em> temporary?  Is it literally impossible to feel awesome all the time, for months or years at a stretch?</p>

<p>Turns out the answer is no.</p>

<p>There is something called chronic mania, which is just what it sounds like: a manic state, including euphoria/elation, which lasts for over 6 months, sometimes forever.</p>

<p>The nineteenth-century psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin was the first to give a clinical description of chronic mania, though some modern neurologists think that today those patients would be diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia[1], and in his day, chronic mania was the second most common reason for a patient to be committed to a mental hospital.[2]</p>

<p>Apart from the length of their episodes, chronic mania patients differ from bipolar patients in a few systematic ways.  Chronic mania generally doesn’t alternate with depression, and is more likely than bipolar mania to come with an “elated mood.”  Chronic mania, compared to bipolar mania, is more likely to come with delusions, especially delusions of grandeur, while bipolar mania is more likely to come with symptoms of psychomotor agitation like tension, pressured speech, loss of sleep, and elevated sex drive.[2] Chronic mania is more likely to begin after age 40.[3]</p>

<p>The typical pattern, from case studies, seems to be of a person who may have had transient manic episodes in the past, “settling into” a chronic manic state where they are generally euphoric but out of touch with reality, engaging in reckless, inappropriate, or obnoxious behavior, until they come to the attention of psychiatrists when neighbors or relatives bring them to the hospital.</p>

<p><strong>Case Studies</strong></p>

<p>Kraepelin commented on the behavioral disinhibition and poor impulse control of chronic mania patients:</p>

<p>“Only the coarser enjoyments, eating, drinking, smoking, snuffing, still arouse in them vivid feelings, further the satisfaction of their personal wishes and wants…[they] talk more than their share, swagger, try to gain for themselves all possible little advantage.”[1]</p>

<p>He also notes that they engage in hoarding behavior:</p>

<p>“They collect all possible rubbish in their pockets, make a mess with it all round about, rub and wipe things, adorn themselves with rags and scraps of ribbon.”[1]</p>

<p>Frederic Wertham, a psychiatrist writing in 1929, described cases of chronic mania that fit the overall pattern.[4]  In all seven cases, the chronic mania began after age 30 (later than the typical onset of bipolar disorder), and in all cases it lasted several years.  In several cases, the patients had previously had briefer manic episodes.</p>

<p>Wertham describes traits such as “pressure of activity, great sociability, lack of fatigue, good humor”, “noisiness and talkativeness”, “buoyant” and “elated” moods, “wild schemes” and delusions (of unrealistic business deals, religious revelations, million-dollar inheritances),  “joviality and playfulness with jokes and laughing”, “vulgar and profane” language and sexual advances towards nurses.</p>

<p>Like Kraepelin’s patients, one of Wertham’s patients collects useless items and decorates herself – she “wore flowers in her hair and bits of colored wool tied to her buttons…continued decorating herself with little objects.”</p>

<p>Wertham notes some patterns: chronic mania patients tend to be middle-aged at onset, tend to have highly sociable and active personalities even before their illness, have no sign of cognitive decline (as you’d expect in dementia), and tend to be heavyset.</p>

<p>Similar features show up in more recent case studies of chronic mania: older age, hoarding, delusions, disinhibited behavior.</p>

<p>One 68-year-old woman[5] had been in an “elevated mood” state for 30 years, during which she increasingly hoarded objects and lived in increasing squalor, refusing all help. She had no sign of dementia or memory loss when tested, and no history of drug abuse. Prior to her illness she had had one depressive episode after the death of her husband, and before that she had been a “rather jovial schoolmistress” – like Wertham’s patients, her baseline personality was cheerful.  She recovered after treatment with lithium.</p>

<p>A 65-year-old Indian man had been manic for 48 years,[6] with the onset beginning after a fever at age 12.  He was “cheerful, optimistic, talkative, outgoing, and overly confident,” and became involved in politics with some success. But he also engaged in reckless behavior, traveling by train across India without paying his fare, stealing objects and giving them away to the poor. He “would often describe himself as a messenger of God with special powers, stating God had created him for the welfare of poor people”.  He couldn’t hold down a job and he was divorced twice, but his mood was “persistently cheerful or irritable.”  He was eventually hospitalized due to complaints by neighbors and relatives, and recovered after a temporary course of treatment with antipsychotics.</p>

<p>A 33-year-old woman who had been manic for 17 years[7] “expressed grandiose beliefs and evidenced a euphoric mood”, and had been unable to keep a job due to her “over-familiar” behavior.  She had never abused drugs.  “Her parents described her premorbid personality as generally affable, co-operative and creative but occasionally forceful and stubborn.”</p>

<p><strong>Chronic Mania and Brain Damage</strong></p>

<p>A variety of case studies of chronic mania identified a neurological cause.</p>

<p>One young woman who had mania-like symptoms since childhood (behavior problems, restlessness, talkativeness, labile and disinhibited mood, sexually provocative behavior starting at adolescence) was found upon radiological examination to have severe degeneration of the cerebellum.[8]</p>

<p>Another patient, a young man who had been electrocuted by getting entangled with a wire two years previously, developed manic symptoms of grandiose and persecutory delusions, hallucinations, poor judgment, and increased appetite.[9]</p>

<p>A 55-year-old man who had become irritable, extremely sociable, and extravagant with money was found to have an oligodendroglioma, a large brain tumor in the left temporoparietal lobe, and his symptoms improved after surgery.[10]</p>

<p>An eight-year-old child who had been ill with polioencephalomyelitis had a marked personality change – “he started talking excessively, singing songs and dancing. The symptoms became worse once he came home. He started talking with relatives, neighbours and strangers, content of talk was how he would act in a movie, how he would build a big house, that he would marry a beautiful lady, etc. He was singing film songs, was going out of the house and it used to be very difficult to locate and bring him back. His appetite was increased, sleep was disturbed. Majority of the time, he was very happy and cheerful.”[11]</p>

<p>A patient with a stroke damaging the periventricular zone of the hypothalamus was reported to have developed “persistent euphoria”, while in another case of brain surgery on the hypothalamus, “every time the surgeon gently wiped coagulated blood from the ventricle floor the patient burst out laughing, whistled, made jokes, and uttered obscene remarks.”[12]</p>

<p>An 81-year-old woman with a stroke in the right thalamus “became increasingly euphoric and talkative, and had grandiose delusions…believed that her health was better than ever and joked inappropriately. She also reported a decreased need for sleep.” After treatment with a temporary course of antipsychotics, she recovered but was still “mildly euthymic.”[13]</p>

<p>Out  of 66 consecutive patients treated for head trauma, 6 (9%) developed mania[14]. The only lesion location significantly associated with mania was the temporal pole (p = 0.0005), which is also one of the first areas damaged in frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<p>Compared to patients who developed bipolar disorder after brain injury, patients who developed only mania after brain injury were significantly more likely to have cortical lesions (esp. the orbitofrontal cortex and the right basotemporal cortex.)[15]</p>

<p>Another study found that mania after brain injury was “was associated primarily with orbitofrontal, thatamic, caudate, and basotemporal lesions in the right hemisphere.”[16]</p>

<p>The most common locations of lesions for patients with post-stroke mania (out of 74 cases) are the right frontal lobe and basal ganglia. Out of 16 patients who developed mania after a brain tumor, the tumor was in the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, or subcortical limbic structure in 13 patients, and two patients (12.5%) had chronic mania.  [17]</p>

<p>One of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis is reported to be euphoria, or “euphoria sclerotica”, an unusual cheerfulness, optimism, and lack of awareness of their physical disability.</p>

<p>In a study of 44 MS patients and 22 healthy controls, 13% of MS patients had euphoria and 13% had …</p></article></div>

<p>In the last few weeks, people across the U.S. have been receiving unexpected packages of peas in their mail. News of these mysterious shipments circulated with theories ranging from accidental shipment to agricultural sabotage – the real reason though is tied to product review fraud. In this post, we’ll share what we have learned about this growing problem and discuss tools to help you filter out the fakes.</p>
<p>Product reviews are an invaluable shopping tool, but one that can’t be trusted blindly. Immoral sellers are increasingly introducing fake reviews to their products to deceive shoppers. It’s not just about the fake reviews though – these sellers also use increased review volume to boost their product’s ranking. </p>
<h2>Brushing</h2>
<p>Brushing is a method used to post fake reviews. It’s not a complicated concept, but affords sellers a way to post fraudulent reviews by using someones home address to send their product or a cheap substitute. Most recently, sellers sent peas but these were likely just substitutes used to make a transaction look legitimate so they can post fake reviews for one of their products. Here’s a quick video, from KCEN news, covering this event and talking briefly about brushing:</p>
<figure><p>
<iframe title="Why is China sending packages of seeds?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3dIwvCppr3w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>
<h2>Fake Reviews Impact</h2>
<p>As you can see, this isn’t a new problem, but is one that continues to grow. It appears that those most susceptible to becoming the recipients of these items are those who have shopped with Chinese based retailers. If you are selected as the recipient for products associated with this scam, it is recommended you change all of your passwords with retailers and report it – feel free to keep the items. </p>
<p>It’s still concerning though because some stranger is using your home address and potentially your name and/or account to deceive shoppers into purchasing their product. On top of that, you have no control over what they send to your mailbox. You don’t know the source of the product or whether or not it is safe to use. </p>
<h2>Other Methods Used</h2>
<p>Sellers will also pay people directly the cost of their product plus a fee to post false reviews using accounts the poster controls. These types of services are widely available and cost next to nothing for the seller as they ultimately serve as both the seller and buyer. </p>
<p>Going a step further and to corroborate reviews, unscrupulous sellers will setup comparison websites with fake reviews pushing their products and services. This is especially rampant in high-paying affiliate markets. </p>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>Separating real and fake reviews is nearly impossible. Luckily there are some tools that can help you filter out the fakes – the best we found is from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://reviewmeta.com/" target="_blank">Reviewmeta</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fakespot.com/" target="_blank">Fakespot</a>. Both are free and easy to use – just enter the URL of the product. They also offer browser add-ons so you can conveniently check the authenticity of a products reviews as you shop. We don’t like to install add-ons so we just stick to their site. </p>
<p>Here is a brief video for Reviewmeta:</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that these are not perfect solutions, but they do give you some weapons in the fight against fake products reviews.</p>
<h2>Our Recommendation</h2>
<p>The volume of fake reviews and product descriptions is difficult to grasp. One of the major reasons we started this site is to combat these predatory practices by sharing first-hand product knowledge. To minimize your risk of falling victim to false reviews, we recommend that you remain skeptical of online reviews, use different review sources to look for discrepancies, and use the tools discussed in this post for trustworthy product insights. There really is no single solution to avoid deceitful reviews, but armed with these tools and knowledge may help you avoid a costly mistake.</p>
<p>As always, we are happy to answer any questions you may have. Safe shopping. </p>

July 29, 2020 | https://jmmv.dev/2013/08/cli-design-series-introduction.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jmmv.dev/2013/08/cli-design-series-introduction.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Ready for a new series?</p>

<p>Having just gone over a bunch of items regarding <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2013/08/readability-series-wrap-up.html">code readability</a>, it is time to shift gears and get into the topic of the design of Command Line Interfaces (or CLIs for short).</p>

<p>The main focus of this series will be to cover best practices involved in creating applications whose interface is command-line oriented. Among other things, I will detail how the CLI should accept optional and required arguments, how a tool should expose more than one action and how interactive help should be handled.</p>

<p>Please note that console applications that use “drawing” libraries like <code>curses</code> are out of scope in these series: these applications follow to some extent the same principles as GUI-based applications, with the only difference being that their rendering happens in text mode. Therefore, the guidelines for their design are completely different and I don’t have enough experience to comment on them.</p>

<p>And now, a little disclaimer: I am well aware that the articles on this topic can be controversial: there are several different ways to design a CLI just as there are a million ways to design a GUI or a web page. So… just keep in mind that what I will be describing here are my own recollection of thoughts after having had to deal with tons of command line utilities and being annoyed by their inconsistencies and surprising behaviors — all caused by each tool implementing its own style for no real reason.</p>

<p>Hope that you agree, at least, on a few points ;-)</p>

homepage</a></strong> on GitLab which has a <strong>live
demo</strong> that runs in your web browser and other resources including
source code.</p><h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2><p>I’ve long been involved in the community of people who program for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-83_series">TI-83+ series of graphing calculators</a>; it was on that platform that I got started programming in the first place. These days I play more of an advisory than active role in writing programs, by running much of <a href="https://www.cemetech.net/">Cemetech</a> behind the scenes and providing the occasional input to others. I think calculators are an excellent way to introduce people to programming, since they are readily available devices and not too complex to get started on, while still having enough capability to support experienced developers in doing interesting things (because they are readily accessible embedded systems). I fully credit getting started with programming calculators for having ended up programming embedded systems profesionally.</p><figure><img src="https://www.taricorp.net/2020/introducing-tihle/calcdcc.jpg" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Tim's workspace for

looks like it could contain any embedded engineer's prototype.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, the future of programming for TI calculators seems to be in peril. About a month ago, the news came out that new versions of the OS for the TI-84+ CE (the most recent variant of the 83+ featuring a color screen and improved eZ80 processor) <a href="https://www.cemetech.net/news/2020/5/949/_/ti-removes-asmc-programming-from-ti-83-premium-ce">will remove support for running native code</a>.</p><h3 id="death-of-a-platform">Death of a platform</h3><p>While this doesn’t necessarily affect older calculators or programs, in the long
term it seems to spell doom for calculators as an inroad to developing embedded
software in particular. Programs written in the calculators’ dialect of BASIC
continue to be accessible and a new Python implementation fills the void
somewhat, but they lack in depth- where a user could spend time and effort
developing native programs constrained only by the hardware they run on before, in
the future users will be <strong>limited to only those capabilities provided by TI’s
software</strong>.</p><p>In much the same way that I believe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)">Scratch</a> is a decent introduction to programming but completely hides interesting details and is not seriously used by anybody but those using it a learning tool, I also believe removal of support for running native code will ultimately mean people will no longer have calculators (which are often required school equipment!) as a useful entrypoint to serious programming.</p><h3 id="historical-interest">Historical interest</h3><p>In addition to the loss of a way to introduce people to programming, removing support for native code also effectively throws away a large existing library of programs that stretches back more than 20 years (nicely embodied in <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/">ticalc.org</a>, which first came online in 1996). While the 84+ CE is a young platform relative to the TI-83+ series as a whole (and is incompatible with earlier software), it already has a rich library of programs created by users that will effectively be lost when they can no longer be run on the hardware they are designed for.</p><figure><picture>

<a href="https://www.cemetech.net/downloads/files/1347">Tetric A</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>The precedent of effectively <strong>destroying the work of community members</strong> is
troubling, and I am motivated to look for ways to preserve it. In much the same
way that there still exist thriving communities around long-obsolete home
computers like the <a href="https://apple2online.com/">Apple II</a> and <a href="https://thec64community.online/">Commodore
64</a> today, I think it’s worthwhile to try to
provide a similar opportunity by preserving the platform into a hostile future
by working to give the systems and software ongoing life beyond what their
creators envisioned (or perhaps more pointedly, beyond what they decided they
could make money from).</p><p>As a newer platform than those early home computers that still have active communities, information and resources may be rather easier to come by for these calculators because much of the information was born digital and has always been online. However this is also hazardous to preservation, because if items are readily available online there may not be any replacements available if the original goes away. For instance, TI used to <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/archives/news/articles/1/19/19421.html">freely provide an SDK for the 83+</a>, but have more recently made it <a href="https://education.ti.com/en/customer-support/sdk-request">much more difficult to access</a>. Perhaps even more concerningly, TI’s web site no longer seems to provide <em>any</em> information about the <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/basics/calculators/ti-84plus-cse.html">TI-84+ CSE</a>, seeming to deny that it ever existed (though manuals and software are still available if you know where to look).</p><h3 id="a-calling">A calling</h3><p>Recognizing these concerns about the loss of a valuable resource for beginning programmers and loss of interesting history to the grind of the education-industrial complex,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> what are we to do?</p><p>There exist a number of web sites that document the calculators and offer
resources related to them- I’m already involved in that, which is valuable and
<a href="https://archive.org/details/ticalc-2014-08">generally well-preserved</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/">the
Internet Archive</a>. But if the existing resources are
useless on current hardware as they largely become when large classes of
programs are not runnable, new tools become required: I believe this situation
calls for emulation of the calculators, to <strong>make the platform accessible to
everybody</strong>.</p><h2 id="the-state-of-the-art">The state of the art</h2><p>There already exist a number of emulators for TI calculators, including:</p><ul><li><a href="http://wabbitemu.org/">WabbitEmu</a>, which is open-source and generally good
quality.</li><li><a href="https://www.cemetech.net/projects/jstified/">jsTIfied</a>, an emulator
available as a web application.</li><li><a href="https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/84/8442.html">Virtual TI</a>,
one of the earliest calculator emulators to be created.</li><li><a href="https://wikiti.brandonw.net/index.php?title=Emulators:PindurTI">PindurTI</a>,
which is now defunct but offered some useful capabilities in its day.</li><li>..and others</li></ul><p>While most of these are accurate enough to run most programs, this is not the
whole story: all of them <strong>require a ROM image to work</strong>. The ROM includes the
calculator’s operating system and boot code, which implement huge swaths of
functionality from keyboard and display handling through implementing
floating-point arithmetic and the TI-BASIC interpreter.</p><p>TI jealously protect their OS and boot code because from the point of view of
their business, the entire value of the calculator is in its software. If an
emulator can run the same software on a more general machine, what reason is
there for a user to purchase a $100 device from TI?<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> But if we want
to preserve <em>community</em> software for emulation, we don’t really care about the
same functions that TI are interested in protecting.</p><p>Though truly accurate emulation still requires all OS functions be available in
the same way, many applications only use a small subset of them. So what options
are available for emulating the system software?</p><h3 id="os-implementations">OS implementations</h3><ul><li>TI’s EOS (TI-OS) is provided with the calculator, and can be downloaded
from TI in order to update a calculator. However, they added a <a href="https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8819">clickwrap
agreement to the OS in
2013</a> that attempts
to forbid use of the OS for emulation. While that clause is questionably
enforceable, nobody (myself included) is very interested in challenging it-
mostly because TI has historically tended to turn a blind eye to the
distribution of ROMs. Any such distribution in a larger, more public forum
increases the risk of calling in the lawyers, so for these and the reasons
discussed above, I do not believe it is tenable to use TI’s OS for
general-availability emulation.</li><li>Brandon Wilson’s <a href="https://www.brandonw.net/calculators/OS2/">OS2</a> seems most
relevant, in that it wants to reimplement TI-OS “but better.” However,
it hasn’t been updated in 11 years at this point and seems dead. It’s also
dependent on the assembler and tools provided by Zilog, which only run on
Windows and are closed-source.</li><li><a href="https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5686">GlassOS</a>
is implemented in C and actually seems useable, but lacks compatibility
with any existing software.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/KnightOS/KnightOS">KnightOS</a> is UNIX-like and seems to
have a selection of useful software, but again is not compatible with any
existing software beyond a small library of ports targeting it.</li><li>Many other people (myself included) have attempted to write OSes, but they
don’t merit mention here because they’re of even less practical use.</li></ul><h3 id="boot-code">Boot code</h3><p>While the calculator OS implements most functionality, the boot code is also
relevant- TI’s OS uses some support code from the boot code, and of course the
boot code is responsible for handling the system power-up sequence and allowing
recovery from a no-OS situation.</p><p>The boot code on these calculators is meant to be read-only,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and is
programmed into the device at the factory. Thus, there is no official source for
boot code short of reading it from the memory of a physical calculator and the
community consensus tends to be that sharing copies of the boot code would
infringe on TI’s copyright.</p><p><a href="https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/authors/72/7233.html">Ben “FloppusMaximus”
Moody</a> at one time
published a reimplementation of the calculator boot code called “BootFree,”
which seems to have disappeared from the Internet except for the version
integrated with WabbitEmu. While it seems BootFree disappeared for reasons
related to the addition of the clickwrap agreement to the EOS downloads provided
by TI,<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> I don’t think the same
reasons apply to emulation of non-EOS software- thus, BootFree seems like a
fine resource in pursuit of making emulation available to all.</p><h2 id="design">Design</h2><p>If the goal is to freely emulate calculator programs, we recognize that while
the boot code situation seems compatible with accurate emulation, the current
available
<strong><em><abbr title="Software allowing anybody to use or modify it for any reason; Open Source.">libre</abbr></em>
OSes are insufficient</strong>. While it is technically feasible to
emulate TI’s EOS (the only reasonable choice for emulating the current software
library), legal forces make it untenable to use as a base for publicly-available
emulation with the goal of allowing anybody to run programs for the platform.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that there are two major divisions in kinds of programs
that run on these calculators: they can be implemented in the provided BASIC
dialect (TI-BASIC), or distributed as machine code for the …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>Are you confused about what to learn when it comes to the fundamentals of programming? Do you constantly get told that algorithms and data structures are the gold standard for what will help propel your understanding? How do you get better at designing solutions rather than operating preexisting ones?</p>
<p>Most of what people try to shill as fundamentals does not end up empowering people with a framework around problem solving. People assume that instead of having the ability to solve problems themselves, they instead need to learn a grab-bag of tool-oriented prior knowledge. This taints one's arc of learning with the idea that it is all about gobbling up technical arcana, all the while reliant on others to find just which mystery to focus on next.</p>
<p>Mathematics and systems thinking has helps me build mental models of almost everything around me, aiding me in how I navigate the world and make decisions. You are likely carrying around <em>lots</em> of mental models with you already. Strong mental models that refine over time give you the ability to understand different programming languages without having to read entire books, immerse yourself in new code you've never seen before without having to ask a number of it's inventors who may have left little to no documentation, or, perhaps, how to reason about a market you are creating as part of a business. <strong>Models describe the essence of these things; them being "mental" is merely a matter of keeping them in your head.</strong></p>
<p>Modeling is about describing systems. While a collection holds all the items contained, a system augments this with descriptions of how the items interrelate. <strong>At it's essence, a system is a collection of shapes, usually boxes or circles, representing distinct entities, and arrows describing the relationships between these entities.</strong> If you're mathematically inclined a system is a graph with nodes (the shapes) and edges (the arrows).</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.justanotherdot.com/assets/images/systems-thinking-a-primer-pdp11.jpg" alt="A functional block diagram of the PDP-11 computer" title="A functional block diagram of the PDP-11 computer">
  
</figure>
<p>The shapes in the graph expressed should <strong>not</strong> be thought of as black boxes. Instead, <strong>think of a systems diagram as merely a view of the system at a particular scale.</strong> It is not that we should never see the details of the entities in the system, as the popular notions around encapsulation may lead us to think, but that we are simply ignoring them when discussing the system at this level of detail.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.justanotherdot.com/assets/images/systems-thinking-a-primer-555-timer.jpg" alt="A schematic for a 555 timer integrated circuit" title="A schematic for a 555 timer integrated circuit">
  
</figure>
<p>Systems that describe the flux of some unit, continuous or discrete, often refer to the unit flowing across the connections as a <strong>stock</strong>. <strong>Taps</strong> adjust the rate of flow of the stocks along the arrows. It's is a good practice to not overload the usage of what an arrow means by having it describe verbs <em>or</em> the inlet and outlet of stocks, but not both.</p>
<p>Systems inevitably end up describing repetitive actions, otherwise known as <strong>loops</strong>. A loop may consist of a way to communicate necessary changes to some other entity in the loop which we call <strong>feedback</strong>. A loop with finely-tuned feedback mechanism will seek some state of equilibrium while a loop whose feedback is disregarded or misaligned will self-reinforce in some general trend. If a stock is involved, you can see how producers and consumers are affecting the quantity of the stock in this system with a behavior-over-time graph.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.justanotherdot.com/assets/images/systems-thinking-a-primer-feedback-loops.jpg" alt="A systems diagram showing the basics of feedback loops. Author: Kjell Magne Fauske licensed under CC BY 2.5" title="A systems diagram showing the basics of feedback loops. Author: Kjell Magne Fauske licensed under CC BY 2.5">
  
</figure>
<p>When we talk about misalignment of feedback in loops, we tend to mean the amount of delay of some message or action. <strong>All loops have some delay in their communications</strong>, but the tuning of that delay is important. Given the context of the system or loop, a short delay may be just as bad as a long delay. A system describing the supply and demand of a widget may want a certain sized delay so that demands for manufacture do not lead to oversupply.</p>
<p>An example of a system seeking a state of equilibrium may be a thermostat connected to a heater. If the heater reaches a target point on the thermostat, the heater stops until the thermostat drops below the target point. If the thermostat didn't exist, there would be no feedback and the heater would continue to increase over time. If there was a substantial delay in the feedback of the thermostat to the unit that controls whether or not the heater is on, the heat would also continue to grow up until a point. If you include a cooling system, you may get finer control of both directions of temperature. It's worth mentioning that most systems of growth have a saturation point, but that point may be functionally quite high in the context of use!</p>

Author: Controlsystemintro licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0" title="A systems diagram showing the parts of an air conditioner. Author: Controlsystemintro licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0">
  
</figure>
<p>State machines also make up the basis of a system; the boxes are states, the arrows transitions between states, and the use of a state machine includes tracking the current state of where an agent in the state machine might be. This type of thinking is highly underappreciated when designing transactional systems such as network requests, payment flows, and so on. State machines help clarify if the flow of logic has any odd behavior, such as winding up in invalid states or transitions that lead to inescapable states.</p>
<figure>

Author: Ivan Griffin licensed under CC BY 2.5" title="A state machine describing the TCP/IP control flow. Author: Ivan Griffin licensed under CC BY 2.5">
  
</figure>
<p>The best way to get better at systems thinking is to start drawing out systems diagrams. Drawing by hand in a journal is my preferred route, but there are also many services that make doing these easily. For example, here's an incredibly rough sketch of a diagram I copied from Richard Hamming's classic "The Art of Doing Science and Research" showing the essence of a CPU.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.justanotherdot.com/assets/images/systems-thinking-a-primer-cpu.jpg" alt="A hand-drawn diagram of the essential parts of a CPU, based on
    Richard Hammings work in The Art of Doing Science and Engineering" title="A hand-drawn diagram of the essential parts of a CPU, based on
    Richard Hammings work in The Art of Doing Science and Engineering">
  
</figure>
<p>It also helps to see other people building up systems, as I've included some examples here. Functional block diagrams are my favorite but if you see any type of graph you could, theoretically, coerce that into the idea of a system and think about its causal relationships, how time plays a part of the system and the states that it may be in, how the author of the diagram has chosen to render distinct parts of the system, or maybe combine both the flow of units <em>as well as</em> the actions between nodes and see how confusing that gets. There are lots of places like the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> and <a href="http://bitsavers.org/">Bitsavers</a> that have scanned copies of old computer reference manuals with plenty of circuit and functional block diagrams that are great places to start, and an article discussing architectural changes is worth it's weight in gold, <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/secondary-storage-to-just-storage/">like this one by Charity Majors</a>. <em>Don't worry about system diagrams being perfect; in the same way that writing can help you refine your thoughts, systems diagrams can help refine your thinking around a system.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><figure id="w-node-d2eae0c6afad-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f1f443920701d151f90e0a2_audit-trail.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>App security means app visibility, and <strong>audit logs</strong> are becoming a key requirement of both enterprise customers and fast growing startups. Building audit logs into your app will help land those larger deals and give your customers conviction in your product’s security profile – but actually choosing which events to log, deciding on payloads, and exposing events via the right APIs is far from easy. Our guide will walk you through the basics that every developer should know: why audit logs are important, event formats, SIEM tools, retention best practices, and everything else you didn’t realize you needed to know. </p><h2>The basics: what audit logs are and why you should care</h2><p>CIOs and IT admins (and really anyone involved in security) need <strong>full visibility</strong> into the apps their teams are using: who’s logging in, resetting their password, and accessing what data. Let’s imagine we’re an internal IT admin at Kellogs – and we want visibility into how our organization is using Salesforce. A few things we might be curious about:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Has someone tried and failed to log in 10 times in the past hour?</li><li>Who accessed PII (personally identifiable information) in the past week?</li><li>How many users accessed a sensitive report that was accidentally shared with the wrong team?</li></ul><p>Audit logs answer these questions by providing a granular paper trail of what app users have done. Every time a user does anything of consequence – log in, reset password, create report, you name it – your system emits an event with useful metadata about that event. Companies will <strong>expose</strong> these events via a UI and/or an API so admins can analyze them at scale. Here’s a quick example of what an event might look like:</p><p>The data in audit logs have a variety of different possible use cases by IT admins. In specific industries such as finance, there are laws that require companies store a “paper trail” of user behavior (such as messages) in an audit log, often referred to as data retention. These logs may also be used for digital forensics in the case of a breach, or “e-discovery” during a lawsuit. However in most cases, audit logs are primarily used by admins to inspect user behavior during configuration and set up alerts for potential malicious actors or account compromise.</p><p>Audit logs aren’t only a requirement for giant monolithic enterprises; the need for visibility is being pushed “downstream” to smaller companies as they use more and more applications. Audit logs will help your business move upmarket, but they’ll also help improve retention and close your existing target deals faster.</p><h2>What kinds of events to emit and how</h2><p>Building audit logs into your app isn’t <em>technically</em> difficult – if you’ve instrumented your product with something like Segment already, it’s very similar code. As with most enterprise features, the devil is in the details: what kinds of events to emit, what the payload should be, how to store events, and how to integrate these events with the wider enterprise toolkit.<br></p><h5><strong>1. What kind of events to log</strong></h5><p>The goal of audit logs is to provide a paper trail of important actions that help IT admins and security folks get a detailed picture of what’s happening in your app – that’s the driving logic for what kinds of events you should be writing. </p><p>Chances are you already emit events in a similar fashion: but your audit log events <strong>should not be the same as analytics or observability events</strong>. This is a common mistake companies make - the kind of data a team needs internally for product analytics and general instrumentation will <em>overlap</em> with audit logs, but different use cases necessitate different data (especially handling concerns around PII). The same is true of your observability data: if you’re sending events to Elasticsearch / Prometheus / Honeycomb / your monitoring system of choice, those events might overlap with audit logging use cases – but you’ll need to do a ton of scrubbing and cleaning in advance. </p><p>There’s no catalog of what <em>exact</em> events to instrument, but a few general guidelines might help:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Login / auth</strong> - Anything related to signing up, signing in, resetting passwords, updating usernames, etc.</li><li><strong>Data access</strong> - Opening, updating, or deleting a document or spreadsheet (whatever the canonical unit of your product is).</li><li><strong>Billing</strong> - Updating billing or subscription info.</li><li><strong>Search / navigation</strong> - Using search, navigating around the product.</li></ul><p>Conversely, here are a few examples of things that you <em>shouldn’t</em> be including in your audit logs:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Performance data</strong> - How long a job took to run, CPU usage, etc.</li><li><strong>Internal tracing</strong> - Errors, exceptions, and stack traces.</li></ul><p>If you’re not sure what kind of events to include, look to other products and talk to your customers - they might have specific requirements custom to their compliance needs. <br></p><h5><strong>2. Event payloads and formatting</strong></h5><p>There’s no widely accepted standard for audit log payloads yet, so things are kind of a mess. The general rule of thumb is to include enough information to be useful, but nothing that doesn’t fit the audit log use case (e.g. product data). The typical format looks something like this:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>An actor </strong>- The ID of the user that’s carrying out the action (can also be the system).</li><li><strong>A group </strong>- The permission group(s) the user is part of, usually an organization ID or domain.</li><li><strong>An action type </strong>- The name of the event (password_changed, authentication_successful).</li><li><strong>Timestamp</strong> - A... timestamp. Keep things in UTC, as always.</li></ul><p>Unsurprisingly, there is at least one standard that’s gotten some traction: it’s called the <a href="https://kc.mcafee.com/resources/sites/MCAFEE/content/live/CORP_KNOWLEDGEBASE/78000/KB78712/en_US/CEF_White_Paper_20100722.pdf">Common Event Format</a> (CEF), and it comes from <a href="https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/products/siem-security-information-event-management/overview">ArcSight</a>, a SIEM provider (more on that later). The standard is aimed at making it easier to communicate between security systems, and prescribes a library of standard event fields like sourceHostName and and requestURL. However, in practice most audit log systems do not match the CEF.</p><p>Whether you follow the CEF or not, there’s one thing you can do: <strong>standardize internally</strong>. Keeping the same structure across all audit events will improve your user experience and make building your audit logs portal a lot easier. This is true across all product instrumentation, but doubly the case here - before building audit logs into your app, sit down with your stakeholders and customers to figure out which fields should be standard and required.<strong>‍</strong></p><h5><strong>3. Retention windows</strong></h5><p>If you’re supporting thousands of users, your audit logs will start to take up a good amount of space. They’ll also need to be indexed for fast search and filtering on various facets. Unnecessarily keeping audit logs forever isn’t always the right approach. Companies typically run a 90 day retention window and allow customers to pay for longer term storage such as 1 - 3 years. We’ve seen companies store these logs in relational stores like Postgres, search systems like Elasticsearch, and even as flat files in an S3 bucket. Another important note: audit logs should be immutable once they’re stored. That’s the whole point.<br></p><h5><strong>4. Building a frontend</strong></h5><p>Once you’ve set up the right system for emitting events on the backend, you’ll need to build a frontend to expose those events to your users. We’ve seen implementations as simple as a table with events in it, and as full-featured admin panels with search, filtering, sorting, and exporting to SIEM solutions (more on that later). What you build depends on the use cases your customers have: detailed frontends are useful if your users are going to interact with audit logs directly in your app, but can be overkill if you’re dealing with much larger customers who will want to export these logs to a different tool anyway.</p><figure id="w-node-ee3bce30d6ea-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f1f6295e9f2b67123846b07_Screen%20Shot%202020-07-27%20at%206.25.52%20PM.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Example audit logs UI from the WorkOS dashboard</figcaption></figure><p>Once you’ve got your events system and frontend in check, you’ve got one more thing to worry about: integration.</p><h2>Integrations: working with SIEM tools</h2><p>When you’re serving hundreds or thousands of users, combing through audit logs manually to find the data you need isn’t going to work. Enterprise admins use specialized tools called SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) to ingest audit logs and provide search, grouping, and visualization. The relationship here is somewhat similar to Elasticsearch / Kibana, where the visualization tool is purpose-built for a specific use case - but SIEM tools go further down the stack to manage storage and search. </p><p>One of the best known SIEM tools is <a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/siem-security-information-and-event-management.html#:~:text=Splunk%20Enterprise%20Security%20(ES)%20is,real%2Dtime%20monitoring%20and%20more.">Splunk</a> – it’s a general purpose aggregation and visualization tool with features built specifically for audit logs. Another good example is <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-sentinel/#features">Sentinel</a>, an Azure specific SIEM from Microsoft. The general idea is that you get a dashboard that aggregates key events over time, as well as granular search and filtering for when you need to dive into specific patterns.</p><figure id="w-node-35807cb27f2b-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f1f54bbc283594367199c89_image%20(5).png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Enterprises will typically be using a SIEM tool like Sentinel, so your systems are going to need to integrate and export data, which, as you can probably guess, isn’t very much fun. Like <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-sso">SSO and SAML</a>, each SIEM solution is going to have different ingestion requirements. Currently there are at least 35 <a href="https://codingcompiler.com/siem-tools-list/">popular SIEM providers</a> out there and many large enterprise admins have bespoke solutions too. You’re lucky if they only request to drop logs in an S3 bucket. We’ve even heard of IT admins wanting a streaming SSH tunnel of events.</p><h2>Walkthrough example: Slack</h2><p>To put all of this together, let’s take a look at a company that <a href="https://workos.com/blog/how-being-enterprise-ready-helps-slack-land-big-deals">has successfully moved upmarket</a> through building great enterprise-ready features: Slack. If you’re on the <a href="https://slack.com/pricing">Enterprise Grid plan</a>, Slack provides access to audit logs via a <a href="https://api.slack.com/enterprise/audit-logs#the_audit_event">read-only REST API</a> that covers pretty much any event that would be of interest to an IT admin or security team. Here are a few examples of the kinds of audit events that Slack retains:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong><em>workspace_created</em></strong> – Emitted when a new workspace is created.</li><li><strong><em>organization_created</em></strong> – Emitted when a new organization is created.</li><li><strong><em>ekm_enrolled</em></strong> – Emitted when an organization enrolls in Slack’s <a href="https://slack.com/enterprise-key-management">EKM.</a></li><li><strong><em>user_channel_join</em></strong> - Emitted when a user joins a channel.</li></ul><p>Each event comes with a semi-standard payload: an <strong>actor</strong> (the user who carried out the action), an <strong>action</strong> (the event type), an <strong>e…</strong></p></div></div></div></div>

  <p>You can read this post in Spanish <a href="https://stanete.com/es/incident-management">here</a>.</p>

<p>At some point in a <em>Product Engineering</em> team you will be tired of every <a href="https://xkcd.com/1700/">bug</a> or issue being urgent and critical. This usually happens after dealing with several problems informed by late night Slack messages. At this point nobody really knows which issue is an urgent incident, which is worth waiting to the next morning and which isn’t even something worth solving. All this is harmful for the team’s culture and for the business itself. When everything becomes urgent, nothing is urgent and nobody cares anymore.</p>

<p>Unlike other processes, Incident Management doesn’t emerge naturally. It’s a defensive mechanism agains <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdTMuivYF30">chaos</a>; it needs to be created and agreed on.</p>

<p>You can’t fix it all at once and you can’t do perfect from the beginning. But you need to start somewhere. This post is about how to go from having nothing related to Incidenct Management to having something.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-start">Where to start</h2>

<p>You may feel the urge to adopt <a href="https://response.pagerduty.com/">Pager Duty’s incident response process</a> or <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/handbook/incident-response">Atlassian’s Incident Management process</a>. Or even to use what’s in this post. Be careful. I’m writting what has worked for my team. Don’t just copy. You have a brain. Use it.</p>

<p>My team literally has all this written down in a Counfluence page. Writting it down is not enought. Everyone should agree to use it. You need to educate through workshops, talks and training sessions giving real life examples and making sure everybody understands the basic process you are about to set in place. Everybody must be on board.</p>

<p>First thing you probably need to address is everything being urgent and critial. For that you need to define what is really an <a href="https://xkcd.com/838/">incident</a> and a few severity levels. Give some real life examples and instructions on how to report each incident. Don’t worry if it isn’t perfect. With every incident you will adapt and iterate over it.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/alert.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-incident">What is an incident</h2>

<p>An incident is an event that causes disruption to a service or a reduction in the quality of a service which requires an emergency response.</p>

<p>That las part is important. Emergency response. An incident has such an impact that gives someone the right to disturb somebody else’s life.</p>

<h2 id="severity-levels">Severity levels</h2>

<p>When you detect an incident try to analyze the impact and apply a severity level. What is severity? The severity of an incident is derived based on the effect of that incident on the system. It indicates the level of threat and how can it affect the system.</p>

<h3 id="sev1">Sev1</h3>

<p>Critical incident that involves irreversible damage to the company or brand reputation, it must be solved instantly even if it means to take the site down. This should never happen.</p>

<p>Example: Security vulnerability exposing customer data, images showing violent content appear on the home page, customer accounts have been hacked.</p>

<p>Typical Response: Call the responsible Engineering Manager.</p>

<h3 id="sev2">Sev2</h3>

<p>Critical system incident actively impacting many customers’ ability to use the product. It is an incident which is a major blocker and has affected the functionality of the whole service. It affects the business as a whole.</p>

<p>Example: Showing big differences in prices, discounts that shouldn’t exist but apply to all the products, site down.</p>

<p>Typical Response: Send a message on Slack on the #radar channel. If nobody responds in 10 minutes, call the responsible Engineering Manager. The fix is to be deployed as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="sev3">Sev3</h3>

<p>Stability or minor customer-impacting incidents that require immediate attention from service owners. Priority number one for the team involved. It can be fixed the next morning.</p>

<p>Example: One category is not working. Emails are not being sent.</p>

<p>Typical Response: Send a message on Slack on the #radar channel. If it happens out of office time it could be fixed the next day.</p>

<h3 id="sev4">Sev4</h3>

<p>Minor issues, cosmetic issues or bugs, requiring action, but not affecting customer ability to use the product, must be prioritized.</p>

<p>Example: One customer didn’t receive a confirmation email. One customer bought an item without stock. The image of a product is not correct.</p>

<p>Typical response: Only in working hours. Talk to the Product Owner and Team Lead of the team responsible for the service/feature.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/bug_fixing.png" alt=""></p>

<p>An incident’s severity level can be upgraded if it is not solved in a resonable amount of time. If that happens, you’ll need to take more severe and drastic actions.</p>

<h2 id="incident-response">Incident response</h2>

<p>Keep calm. Don’t pressure anybody. People work and communicat poorly under pressure.</p>

<p>You don’t need to set up all the roles of a mature <em>Incident Management</em> process. The most important one that you do need is the <strong>Communications Manager</strong> or <strong>Communications Lead</strong>. Somebody will take this role during an incident. This person keeps everybody informed about the status of the situation. What has been detected, what is being investigated, what the team has found, timeframe for resolution, actions that are being taken, etc.</p>

<p>If updates are not communicated regularly people get nervious. Even a message like <em>“We are still investigating.”</em> helps to keep the nerves under control. Give updates every few minutes. It may seem like a lot but believe me, it’s not. When in crisis mode, overcommunicate. I can’t stress this enough.</p>

<p>Later on you can add other roles as <strong>Commander</strong> or <strong>Deputy</strong>, set up <strong>On-Call</strong> processes, etc. All depending on your needs and customized to your organization and culture.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>Start small. Something is better than nothing. And done is better than perfect. Educate and give people time to understand and use the process. Ask for feedback, use each postmortem to analyze the Incident Management process and try to improve it just a tiny bit.</p>

<p>Huge thanks to <a href="https://undraw.co/">undraw.com</a> for the illustrations. You can subscribe to my newsletter <strong>With a grain of salt</strong> and receive an email with updates from time to time.</p>

        <p>Debugging an MCU requires attaching a debugger via JTAG and halting the core. Or does it?</p>

<p>There are many situations where this debug strategy is not feasible such as on</p>

<ul>
  <li>production units where JTAG has been disabled.</li>
  <li>systems where halting the core causes the subsystem you are trying to debug to
fault. (i.e Asserts from the NRF52 SoftDevice after halting at a breakpoint<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">1</a></sup>)</li>
  <li>remote systems where only a UART or network interface is exposed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fortunately, ARM Cortex-M’s have us covered!</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->

<p>This week we explore how to debug running systems with ARM Cortex-M’s DebugMonitor
exception handler. We cover how to configure the MCU to operate in this mode and walk through an
example of installing breakpoints and single-stepping on a running device!</p>

<!-- excerpt end -->

<blockquote>
  <p>In my opinion, DebugMonitor handling is an underutilized feature that can be applied creatively
for a variety of debug use cases. I hope by the end of this article I can convince you of this as well!</p>

halted while debugging. This mode requires access to the <strong>Debug Port</strong> via JTAG or SWD. We’ve
walked through an overview of how ARM debug interfaces work in <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/a-deep-dive-into-arm-cortex-m-debug-interfaces">this article</a>.</li>
  <li>Tracing via the <strong><a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/profiling-firmware-on-cortex-m">ITM</a></strong>,
<strong>DWT</strong> &amp; <strong>ETM</strong> - These peripherals let you stream instruction execution and data
accesses while the system is running. Tools such as Lauterbach’s Trace32<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8">2</a></sup> and SEGGER’s JTrace<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9">3</a></sup>
can decode these streams and present results in a GUI on your desktop.</li>
  <li><strong>Debug monitor mode</strong> - Enables debug on running systems via the DebugMonitor exception
handler. This can be helpful in scenarios where halting the core will cause timing
sensitive subsystems to fail or for use cases where connecting a debugger is not feasible.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s worth noting that debug monitor support is not available for the ARMv6-M architecture
(Cortex-M0). However, it is implemented for all other Cortex-M architectures.</p>

<h2 id="enabling-the-debugmonitor-exception">Enabling the DebugMonitor Exception</h2>

<p>Debug monitor mode based debugging works by triggering an exception known as the “DebugMonitor
Exception” when debug events take place. We’ll explore how to configure the handler in the
following sections.</p>

<h3 id="debug-halting-control-and-status-register-dhcsr-0xe000edf0">Debug Halting Control and Status Register (DHCSR), 0xE000EDF0</h3>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/debugmon/dhcsr.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Monitor Mode Debug only works if halting debug is disabled. Notably, the <code>C_DEBUGEN</code> setting
above must be cleared. This bit can <em>only</em> be set via the JTAG/SWD connection and is <em>only</em> reset when a full
Power-On-Reset (POR) occurs or a debugger clears the bit on exit.</p>

<p>If you are trying to use Monitor Mode Debug, I recommend adding a check on boot for
this. Otherwise, you are bound to confuse yourself when you are trying to test the feature and have a debugger connected via JTAG/SWD:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>bool</span> <span>debug_monitor_enable</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>volatile</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>*</span><span>dhcsr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span>0xE000EDF0</span><span>;</span>

    <span>EXAMPLE_LOG</span><span>(</span><span>"Halting Debug Enabled - "</span>
                <span>"Can't Enable Monitor Mode Debug!"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// code to set up debug monitor mode</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="tip-disabling-halting-debug-from-gdb">TIP: Disabling Halting Debug from GDB</h4>

<p>If you are using GDB, Halting Mode debug can be disabled manually by clearing <code>C_DEBUGEN</code> and setting
the appropriate value for <code>DBGKEY</code> (0xA05F):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) set *(uint32_t*)0xE000EDF0=(0xA05F&lt;&lt;16)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This can also be a useful way to keep an active GDB session open and probe its state while
the system is running!</p>

<h3 id="debug-exception-and-monitor-control-register-demcr-0xe000edfc">Debug Exception and Monitor Control Register (DEMCR), 0xE000EDFC</h3>

<p>The core configuration for the DebugMonitor exception is controlled in the upper 16 bits of the
<code>DEMCR</code> register:</p>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/debugmon/demcr.png" alt=""></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>MON_EN</code> - Controls whether the DebugMonitor exception is enabled or not. When enabled, debug
“events” will cause the exception to fire.</li>
  <li><code>MON_PEND</code> - Can be used to trigger a DebugMonitor exception irrespective of whether or not
<code>MON_EN</code> is set to 1.</li>
  <li><code>MON_REQ</code> - Not used by the MCU. Software can use this bit to convey state about monitor mode.</li>
  <li><code>MON_STEP</code> - Can be toggled from the DebugMonitor exception to enable hardware
single-stepping. When set, upon return from the exception handler, the core will execute a single instruction and then return to the DebugMonitor exception.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: The lower bits (<code>VC_HARDERR</code>, etc) controls whether or not a debug trap occurs automatically when
various types of exceptions take place. These <em>only</em> take effect when using <strong>halting debug</strong>
mode. They allow you to guarantee the system is halted any time an exception path is hit which can be useful
when trying to debug!</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="debugmonitor-exception-configuration-nuances">DebugMonitor Exception Configuration Nuances</h4>

<p>The DebugMonitor exception will only be triggered for debug events when the group priority of the
exception is greater than the current execution priority.</p>

<p>This can be a useful feature to guarantee that certain high priority operations (i.e Bluetooth
radio scheduling) continue to run while you step through the code in other parts of the system.</p>

<p>An important consequence however is it does mean any interrupts running above this priority of the
DebugMonitor exception will not be debuggable when using debug monitor support.</p>

<p>Configuring the DebugMonitor exception priority will require updating <code>SHPR3</code>. More details can be
found in <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/arm-cortex-m-exceptions-and-nvic#system-handler-priority-register-shpr1-shpr3---0xe000ed18---0xe000ed20">our post about ARM Cortex-M exception handling</a>.</p>

<h3 id="c-code-to-enable-the-debugmonitor-exception">C Code to Enable the DebugMonitor Exception</h3>

<p>For simplicity in our example app we will set the DebugMonitor exception to the lowest configurable
interrupt priority. This means all other interrupts will be able to run while debugging code not
running from an interrupt.</p>

<p>Some of the events are only possible when using a <strong>halting debug</strong>. For the DebugMonitor the
states of interest are:</p>

  <li><code>BKPT</code> Indicates one or more breakpoint event took place (either via the FPB or a BKPT instruction).</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><figure id="w-node-70a9116c0fe8-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f20a0e12e2249592eae4d8e_Frame%2015.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>If you want more people using your product, the easiest place to start is making it easier to actually sign up. <strong>Adding SSO to your app</strong> will help you land those larger enterprise deals and decrease the signup friction that keeps causing your visitors to drop off. For modern developers though, the world of XML, SOAP, and OASIS standards can be opaque. Fear not: our guide will walk you through SSO: what it is, why it’s important, and best practices for getting it up, running and integrated with your app.</p><h2>The basics: what SSO is and why you should care</h2><p>The easiest way to understand SSO quickly is to think about your app’s authentication as a service. Most developers build the service themselves: you take care of creating usernames and passwords, adding them into a database, and checking credentials every time someone logs in. But in the same way that you skip building payments infrastructure and use Stripe, you can “outsource” your auth and have someone else do it; and that’s what SSO is.</p><p>If you’ve heard of SSO before, you’re probably thinking of it as a security feature, and that’s true; but where it really shines is through <strong>increased engagement</strong>. Making it easier to sign up for and sign into your product lowers friction for users, increases retention through smoother login flows, and helps you land those elusive enterprise deals (many enterprises can’t work with vendors who don’t support SSO).</p><p>Apps with SSO enabled allow users to authenticate through someone else’s service: instead of you managing usernames and passwords, you integrate with a provider like Okta or OneLogin that does it for you. Those services – called Identity Providers, or IDPs if you want to save time – are generally more full-featured and secure than what your typical growing startup would be able to build themselves.</p><p>SSO is a given among everyone from high growth startups to more traditional enterprises. Here’s the Dropbox sign-in page: they’ve built SSO with Google and Apple as two headline IDPs (they also support Okta).</p><figure id="w-node-171366ed88a2-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f03ef87ff2e125d68276a54_5ef11a093ff6f8501b52b19b_dropbox.png" alt="Dropbox SSO"></p></figure><p>Slack, Asana, Notion, Airtable, and Trello all support SSO too, and some even charge extra for it (you can find them on the <a href="https://sso.tax/">SSO Wall of Shame</a>). It’s pretty much part of the standard growth playbook.</p><h2>Learning the lingo: SAML, SPs, IDPs, and assorted acronyms</h2><p>Let’s get a little deeper into how SSO works. One thing worth noting: SAML isn’t the only protocol you can use to implement SSO. OAuth (1.0 and 2.0) are also popular, as well as WS-Fed and OpenID Connect. The broad concepts can carry over across protocols, too.</p><p>If you’re integrating SSO into your app, you’re a ​<strong>service provider​</strong> (SP). Your app is the service. The provider that you’re “outsourcing” identity to – like Okta or OneLogin – is called the ​identity provider ​(IDP). Simple enough, right? Where things start to get a bit more complex is when your app needs to ​communicate​ with identity providers to actually authenticate your users. SSO works with a communication protocol called ​<strong>SAML</strong> ​(Security Assertion Markup Language) that governs these phone lines.</p><p>SAML – and by extension, how you build and work with SSO – works through <strong>assertions</strong>.</p><figure id="w-node-fda86aed2629-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f03ef87a82ddb32f4057b52_5ef11a0adb11ec2004c7bc71_assertions.png" alt="SSO Assertions"></p></figure><p>Let’s walk through a typical SAML flow, starting with a user trying to sign in through your site.<strong>‍</strong></p><h5>1. The SAML request from the SP</h5><p>When a user navigates to your login page (to log in, of course), they’ll either enter their email or click a button that takes them to an IDP portal like Okta. Your app issues a SAML request (and a browser redirect) to the IDP: it’s basically saying “hey, this user wants to sign in, do me a favor and verify that I should let ‘em in.”</p><h5>2. The SAML assertion from the IDP</h5><p>At the IDP, they’ll enter their full credentials, and deal with more extensive security measures like 2FA. Once they’ve successfully authenticated with the IDP, the IDP sends your app a response containing an assertion: this user is good to go, and you can let them in.</p><p>SAML works via XML (for all those SOAP fans out there. Nobody? Ok). Here’s an example of what a response containing an assertion might look like (thanks to <a href="https://www.samltool.com/generic_sso_res.php">OneLogin</a>):</p><p>The flow we just outlined is called ​<strong>SP-initiated​</strong>, because it started at ​your​ app, and you’re the service provider. There’s another way this can go down though: users can ​start​ at their IDP (like the Okta app directory), click on which app they want to sign into, and then authenticate and redirect. That’s called ​<strong>IDP-initiated​</strong>.</p><h2>Getting practical: how to add SSO to your app</h2><p>Like pretty much anything in software, there are two ways to add SSO to your app: you can build it yourself or pay someone else to do it for you.</p><h5>1. <strong>Building SSO from scratch</strong></h5><p>Building SSO yourself is all about handling and working with the protocol you choose: assuming you’re targeting larger companies, we’re talking about SAML here. This isn’t a technical tutorial, but here are a few high-level components you’ll need to write:</p><ul role="list"><li>A SAML controller for handling requests and providing responses to your integrated IDPs.</li><li>A SAML service to verify x509 certs, entity IDs, and IDP URLs, alongside parsing SAML assertions and creating and validating SAML responses. You’ll particularly enjoy the XML parsing and IDP-specific request formats.</li><li>A strategy to correctly authenticate users in your app based on the attributes that IDPs send back (you’ll need to normalize these if you’re supporting multiple customers).</li></ul><p>If any of this sounds weirdly unfamiliar to you, that’s because it probably is: there’s a lot of upfront research required to understand the right way to do it. It’s not as simple as adding a new frontend library and skimming through the docs.</p><p>Part of the challenge of building SSO from scratch is customization: you’ll need to build SAML flows for each IDP independently. SAML is a standard and like any good standard it’s often fractured and can sometimes be a pain to work with. As usual, XKCD gets it.</p><figure id="w-node-ccb9efecc6ca-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f03ef87590fbe675d1eb724_5ef11a0aa1289c05c64daeb7_xkcd.png" alt="XKCD"></p></figure><p>Over the past few years, the web dev ecosystem has developed a few packages that take care of some of the repeatable work. Middleware like <a href="http://www.passportjs.org/">​passport.js<strong>​</strong></a> can help you avoid building everything from scratch; or if your backend is in Python, OneLogin offers a <a href="https://github.com/onelogin/python-saml">python-saml​</a> package.</p><h5>2. <strong>Use an SSO provider</strong></h5><p>If you don’t want to build SSO yourself (I mean, why would you?), there are a bunch of great third-party services that offer SDKs and packages to make integration as easy as a few lines of code.</p><p><strong>➞ WorkOS (we're biased)</strong></p><p>WorkOS lets you add SSO to your app with just a few lines of code, and it’s completely free. Integrate once and you can support SAML with IDPs like Okta, GSuite, OneLogin, and more. Here’s what that same SAML flow above might look like with something like WorkOS:</p><figure id="w-node-9f81c6e54660-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f03ef874de037b12ed1bd53_5ef11a0a3b878a5998d1038b_sso-workos.png" alt="SSO WorkOS"></p></figure><p>WorkOS ships with something pretty cool – <a href="https://workos.com/docs/sso/embed-workosjs">WorkOS.js</a> – that allows your end-users to configure their own​ SSO connections to their IDP of choice.</p><figure id="w-node-3fccad929910-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f07eb72970fa85d5dbd58cd_workos-workosjs-compressed.gif" alt=""></p></figure><p>Doing this manually is ​rough​: you need to coordinate with enterprise IT admins, exchange URLs and certificates, and build custom infrastructure like field mappers for SAML profiles. It’s not just frustrating; it drags out the integration cycle and takes up sales, support, and success time too.</p><p><strong>➞ Auth0</strong></p><p><a href="https://auth0.com/pricing/">Auth0<strong>​</strong></a> is identity as a service: they offer SSO (among other products) that easily integrates into your app and supports all of the IDPs you’d ever need. Auth0 for social connections is free up to 7K users, and plans start at $23/mo for 1K users. If you want enterprise connections (think: SAML), you’ll need to move into the Developer Pro pricing tier, which starts at $28/mo for 100 users.</p><p><strong>➞ AWS Cognito</strong></p><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Cognito</a> is AWS’s identity-as-a-service product and supports SSO with SAML, OAuth 2.0, and OpenIDConnect. Cognito supports IDPs like GSuite and Facebook, and pricing is...well, it’s AWS, so you’re on your own.</p><p><strong>➞ GCP Identity Platform</strong></p><p>GCP’s identity-as-a-service goes by “<a href="https://cloud.google.com/identity-platform">​Identity Platform</a>​” (catchy) and supports the standard feature set. It also comes with some interesting built-in Google features like Machine Learning based security measures (identifying compromised accounts). Pricing starts at $0.015 per SAML MAU when you’re over 50 MAUs.</p><h2>Best practices from some engineers who have done it before</h2><p>Here are a few tips that might make your SSO integration process just a bit easier, whether you’re using a third-party provider building it from scratch.</p><h5>1. <strong>Security</strong></h5><p><em>Disallow username and password logins, password resets, and email address changes</em></p><p>If an organization is using SSO with your product, give admins the ability to disable username/password based auth for their users. It creates a more seamless SSO experience by avoiding false login starts and keeps things secure.</p><p><em>Enforce session timeouts</em></p><p>Expire idle user sessions to make sure users aren't signed in indefinitely — it's good practice to grab the SAML response's session timeout value and use that, but there are cases where having a "time to live" setting for each account is useful too.</p><p><em>Force sign-in for active browser sessions</em></p><p>If your app gets a new sign-in request, replace any currently active browser sessions with the newly authenticated session. This is particularly important for apps that lean toward multi-tab use, like IDEs or CRMs.</p><h5>2. <strong>Routing</strong></h5><p><em>Ask users for the information to determine the right IDP</em></p><p>If you plan on supporting multiple IDPs in your SSO implementation, ask users for their email address, account subdomain, or unique account URL to determine the correct identity provider for their login.</p><p><em>Make sure to deep link</em></p><p>If you’re asking users to authenticate from an existing product page or they’re expecting to land somewhere in particular in your product, you’ll want to implement deep linking in your SAML flows. You can use ​SAML’s RelayState parameter​ to get this working.</p><h5>3. <strong>UX</strong></h5><p><em>Disable email verification for SSO users</em></p><p>If your app sends verification emails on username/password signups, disable that for SSO authentication: it’s not necessary.</p><p><em>Use Just-In-Time (JIT) User Provisioning for first time sign-ins</em></p><p><a href="https://jumpcloud.com/blog/jit-provisioning-defined">JIT user provisioning<strong>​</strong></a> automates the account creation process for users signing in to your app for the first time via …</p></div></div></div></div>

		<p><span>In </span><span><a href="http://lacker.io/ai/2020/07/06/giving-gpt-3-a-turing-test.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://lacker.io/ai/2020/07/06/giving-gpt-3-a-turing-test.html">Giving GPT-3 a Turing Test</a></span><span>, Kevin Lacker found that GPT-3 does well answering simple factual questions like</span> <span>“Who</span><span> was president of the United States in 1955?”, but also happily answered absurd questions without noticing they didn’t make any sense.&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Q: How many eyes does the sun have?<br>
A: The sun has one eye.</p>
<p>Q: How many eyes does a blade of grass have?<br>
A: A blade of grass has one eye.</p>
<p>Q: How do you sporgle a morgle?<br>
A: You sporgle a morgle by using a sporgle.</p>
<p>Q: How many bonks are in a quoit?<br>
A: There are three bonks in a quoit.</p>
<p>Q: How many rainbows does it take to jump from Hawaii to seventeen?<br>
A: It takes two rainbows to jump from Hawaii to seventeen.</p>
<p>Q: Which colorless green ideas sleep furiously?<br>
A: Ideas that are colorless, green, and sleep furiously are the ideas of a sleep furiously.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the trickiest things about GPT-3 is that <a href="https://twitter.com/gwern/status/1284271608971100162">you can prove that it knows how to do something, but you can’t prove that it doesn’t</a>, since a slightly different prompt can get much better results.</p>
<p><span>Nick Cammarata of OpenAI </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1284050958977130497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1284050958977130497">responded to Kevin’s post on Twitter:</a></span> <span>“it’s all about the prelude before the conversation. You need to tell it what the AI is and is not capable. It’s not trying to be right, it’s trying to complete what it thinks the AI would do :)”</span></p>
<p><span>Nick changed Kevin’s prompt to add a prelude saying:</span> <span><i>‘This</i></span><span><i> is a conversation between a human and a brilliant AI. If a question is</i></span><i> </i><span><i>“normal”</i></span><span><i> the AI answers it. If the question is</i></span><i> </i><span><i>“nonsense”</i></span><span><i> the AI says</i></span><i> </i><span><i>“yo</i></span><span><i> be real”’</i> and added two examples of nonsense questions:</span><br>
<img draggable="true" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EdHdZT4UMAASHpN?format=png&amp;name=small" alt="Image" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><br>
I was surprised this worked. When I asked Nick, he said he didn’t try many prompts, and it’s possible he just got lucky, so I wanted to test the limits of what Gwern is now calling <a href="https://twitter.com/gwern/status/1285723744074452993">Uncertainty Prompts</a>.</p>
<p>Using the same prompt as Nick above, I got the same answer for the first nonsense question:</p>
<p>Q: How many bonks are in a quoit?<br>
A: yo be real</p>
<p>Using ‘Show probabilities’ in the OpenAI Playground settings we can see how probable the model thought this next token was. In this case, it was pretty sure the question was nonsense, since ‘yo’, at 35.91% is twice as probable as the runner up ‘A’ at 17.50%</p>

<span>In this case</span> <span>‘yo</span><span> be real’ wins by a narrower margin.</span></p>

<p>The ‘Temperature’ setting controls how likely the model is to choose what it thinks is the most probable next token each time. We set it high when we want creativity, but in this case we just want to see the most likely completion each time, so we’ll set it to 0.<br>

<p>We’ll add each question we ask to the end of this prompt, then replace it with the next question once we have our answer. For each answer, I’ll include all the different probabilities for the first word. I’ve mostly excluded math questions, which GPT-3 generally struggles with.</p>

<p>For the sake of this post I’m more interested in whether GPT-3 correctly identifies a question as sensible than whether it answers correctly, but we’ll track both to see if there are any interesting correlations.</p>

<p><span>A: yo be real</span></p>

<p>Uhoh, our first mistake, and it was pretty confident this question was nonsense, assigning twice the probability to ‘yo be real’ than the runner up. Entering ‘A’ manually gives us the completion: “<span data-offset-key="erroh-341-0">A</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-342-0">:</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-343-0"> A</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-344-0"> computer</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-345-0"> hard</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-346-0"> drive</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-347-0"> works</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-348-0"> by</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-349-0"> using</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-350-0"> a</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-351-0"> magnetic</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-352-0"> field</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-353-0"> to</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-354-0"> store</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-355-0"> data</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-356-0">.”</span></p>

<p>Reviewing the examples in our prompt, I now notice that both questions starting with ‘How’ are nonsense questions, so we’re accidentally telling the model that the word ‘how’ means a question is more likely to be nonsense. Let’s add these to the prompt:</p>

<p>This is close, but wrong – the latitude is 30.0444 and the longitude is 31.233334. I’m guessing this is because longitude is typically expressed as a pair with latitude and latitude comes first. Testing by replacing Cairo with San Francisco confirms this – it gives us the latitude rather than the longitude.</p>

<p>9/10 questions were correctly identified as sensible, and once we improved our prompt it got 10/10, and 9/10 of the answers were factually correct. <span>Pretty good!</span></p>

                <div>
                    <p>I can’t tell you how many people I have worked with over the years whom I have never met in person. </p><p>And just like working in an office, some of them remained at the “Just circling back on this email!” level, while others grew into the “How has your son been doing since the divorce?” level.</p><p>I experienced this natural evolution recently. I first met Hana through a prior work arrangement; she was a client of my former employer’s. From our first video call--her in Spain, I in the Western U.S.--I knew I had met a kindred spirit. After I parted ways with my firm, Hana and I maintained our weekly video calls, getting to know each other better from afar, mostly by talking about anything and everything. Both aspiring writers, we swapped personal essays. She asked me to do some writing for <a href="https://supportbee.com/">SupportBee</a>, and I agreed. Soon, we promised each other, we would meet in person. I looked at plane tickets to Spain, and she considered attending a conference in San Francisco. Then, the pandemic hit. </p><figure><img src="https://hightouch.co/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-9.11.39-AM.png"><figcaption>Hana and I, the only way we've ever seen each other</figcaption></figure><p>Things got busier for me, as I was homeschooling a young, high-risk child while working, and she was isolated in her apartment, looking at the same four walls every single day. The inability to do much of anything meant we had no new life updates for each other. All dreams were on hold indefinitely. As the month progressed, we became so emotionally drained by such an unexpected global crisis that it took all we had to simply keep true to our weekly video call. And while I had lost motivation for almost everything else, I <em>hadn’t </em>lost my drive to produce good work for Hana--and I attribute that to the friendship we had built prior to...everything. <strong>In a way, working with her--even through a pixelated experience--has made me feel less alone during one of the most isolating times of my life. </strong></p><p>While our situation was different than the typical cubicle soulmate/work wife/see-you-as-much-as-my-own-family scenario, all of this had me wondering--what happens to workplace friendships when they go from the office to the Zoom screen, <em>particularly</em> out of circumstance, and not by choice? And what role does established rapport play in the shift to strictly virtual relationships? While a 21st-century pandemic of this scale is unprecedented (and therefore no such research yet exists), perhaps there’s something we can learn from adjacent data that will help us understand what tele-relationships need to thrive.</p><h2 id="you-re-not-alone-well-kind-of-">You’re Not Alone (Well, Kind Of)</h2><p>Former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy warned that the trend towards remote work (pre-pandemic) was birthing a “<a href="https://hbr.org/cover-story/2017/09/work-and-the-loneliness-epidemic">loneliness epidemic</a>"--a position likely based on research around the effect of office friendships on workplace culture. Employees who say they have strong relationships with co-workers <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/peps.12109">tend to be more productive</a>, more engaged, and generally more satisfied with their jobs. For years, Silicon Valley startups lured talent with the promise of after-work happy hours and other team-building events. But now that the physical water cooler has been reduced to a digital image of a water cooler, prioritizing culture and peer relationships is crucial. </p><p>A more recent study from the <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2018.0466">Academy of Management</a> observed and surveyed workers at a company with a co-located and remote structure. The findings confirmed two things: <a href="https://mgmt.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/barsade/">Sigal Barsade</a>, a University of Pennsylvania professor who studies emotions in the workplace and contributed to this project, says yes--<a href="https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/how-to-stop-loneliness-from-hijacking-your-career">loneliness does impact the quality of our work</a>. <strong>Loneliness emerges because the process of establishing friendships with colleagues is stifled once telework has a presence--a <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236072/why-friendships-among-remote-workers-crucial.aspx">Gallup survey</a> showed that only 15% of remote workers felt they had friends at work.</strong> (In-office rapport is so powerful that <a href="https://www.hrreview.co.uk/hr-news/strategy-news/a-third-of-all-relationships-start-at-work/50545">one-third of romantic relationships start at work</a>!)</p><p>Buffer’s 2019 “<a href="https://buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2019">State of Remote Work</a>” report, which looked exclusively at all-remote companies, revealed that while employees considered a flexible schedule and the ability to work from home to be a pro, the cons were just as significant. The most common complaint was that working remotely made it difficult for them to unplug at work. (I recently heard someone say, “I don’t work from home, I live at work.”) In second place was loneliness, and third place went to communication issues. </p><h2 id="feel-the-love-from-way-over-there">Feel the Love...From Way Over There</h2><p>As opposed to an in-office situation, remote setups elongate the getting-to-know-you process. We miss out on opportunities to “read” people via a constant feed of intonations, facial expressions, and impromptu conversations. As one psychologist <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/02/how-will-you-have-office-romances-and-friendships-when-everyones-working-remotely-9091557/">explains</a>, ”Online communication, similar to everyone’s Instagram ‘best life’ profile, presents an idealized view of the person you’ve set your trackpad on, and there are subtle details missed.”</p><p><strong>The Academy of Management researchers concluded that the best way to address such a barrier is to create an environment where employees can establish a “cadence” with one another.</strong> A cadence sets expectations around when and how employees interact--getting to know each person’s typical response times, job roles, email style, and even their affinities and dislikes (what sign-offs <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90469176/stop-annoying-people-with-these-email-greetings-and-sign-offs#:~:text=The%20best%20way%20to%20sign,%2C%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9CBest.%E2%80%9D">really irk them</a>?). To do this, co-workers must communicate with each other outside an as-needed basis. (At SupportBee, we exercise together virtually with a trainer.) In addition to paving the way for cadence-building, managers should also signal answers to the questions most likely floating around employees’ heads, like, “Is it ok to be ‘friends’ with this colleague?” “How informal can we get on Slack?”</p><p>To keep employees connected beyond the internet, digital product design platform InVision hosts an annual off-site <em>and </em>smaller team offsites (though it was a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/we-cancelled-our-annual-kickoff-meeting-because-happened-brian-kardon/">video event</a> this year).</p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/how-coworkers-are-staying-connected-while-they-work-from-home.html">CNBC recently reported</a> on the ways that companies are fostering culture and peer relationships in the pandemic, a time when entire teams have found themselves working from home for the foreseeable future. While most everything is video-based, it’s important to get creative. General Assembly recreated the morning coffee break and the Gitlab team replicates happy hour. After they wrap the meeting, Gitlab employees with kids let their little ones speak with each other. Parents swap homeschooling and activity ideas for kids and establish a connection beyond deadlines. Basecamp, a<a href="https://hightouch.co/how-co-worker-friendships-impact-remote-work-culture/www.supportbee.com"> SupportBee</a> partner, has a Slack channel where employees can talk about anything <em>but </em>work.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rk2aXaxLUtAyeI6y8N5Jlr24Pbnb3HrJQBcHr-nRAE4NYm7lKKgjGa5yTjWhMyKPrmR525F_wDcWxX0AELL6VT6kV9RYZi3rO77oNci0PaX7BrLl6ri4jpFWIWhgTBkyGPkYKIsJ"><figcaption>Photo credit: <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/">Gitlab</a><span>‌‌</span></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7228-engaging-remote-employees.html">Other tactics</a> management should consider? Encouraging health and wellness and conducting regular check-ins with each employee to help workers feel heard. And if nothing else, it is true that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-the-stress-of-disaster-brings-people-together/">nothing brings people together like a crisis</a>; 20% of respondents in a Robert Half survey reported more substantial<a href="https://www.roberthalf.com/blog/management-tips/covid-19-and-the-workplace-employees-weigh-in?utm_campaign=Press_Release&amp;utm_medium=Link&amp;utm_source=Press_Release"> relationships with co-workers</a> when lockdown was in full swing. And with significant fear (56%) about returning to close quarters too soon, the environment would likely be too tense to keep cubicle-oriented relationships growing right now.</p><p>With a vaccine for COVID-19 a year or more ahead of us, undoubtedly more business will share what works for them (and what doesn’t). In May, an Atlassian employee <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90506101/12-road-tested-team-building-activities-that-work-for-real-life-remote-teams">shared ideas for helping teams keep the cohesion alive</a> based on what her company does. The tactics are divided into three categories: practical vs. just-for-fun; real-time vs. asynchronous; and one-hit-wonder vs. regularly scheduled activities. The ideas reflect what earlier research has advocated: offer a healthy blend of exercises that encourage bonding on a personal level by way of laughter or vulnerability, while also improving professional understanding of each other’s roles and work styles. </p><p>Back to Hana, the dear work friend I’ve never actually met in the flesh. Even though we video conference at least once a week, I wonder if it will be strange when I see her in person--the same way we pause, for a moment, after staring at a photograph, only to look up and realize the small details that make a person who they are have eluded us throughout our study. I’ve had friends express concerns about growing apart from their most beloved colleagues, as remote work seems likely for the rest of 2021. Yet, it is this kind of nervous anticipation that saves me at my loneliest moments at work. One day I will hear what my co-workers’ laughs sound like when they travel through the air, instead of a microphone, thousands of miles away.</p>

<p>We are <a href="https://libro.fm/?cmp=aea" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Libro.fm</a>, an audiobook platform that makes it possible for you to buy audiobooks directly through your local bookstore. We are fiercely independent and we oppose Amazon’s efforts to prevent independent bookstores and libraries from providing certain audiobooks, called Audible Exclusives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One frequently-asked question we get from Libro.fm listeners is why certain audiobooks aren’t available on our platform—like <em>Born a Crime</em> by Trevor Noah and <em>Maybe You Should Talk to Someone</em> by Lori Gottlieb.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is there a word for grief as it relates to being very interested in a story only to find out it’s an Audible exclusive</p>— Becky Dingwell (@BDingz) <a href="https://twitter.com/BDingz/status/1283384951602401282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>While Libro.fm has a catalog of over 150,000 audiobooks—and more than 99% of all <em>The New York Times</em> bestsellers—some titles are unavailable due to exclusive licenses granted by audiobook publishers and authors to Amazon’s Audible.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>What does Audible Exclusive or Audible Original mean?</h3>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">we all know amazon is evil, but did you know that when a book becomes an audible exclusive, libraries cannot buy copies of that audiobook? did you know that capitalism is the enemy of accessibility?</p>— Alyssa (@imajoyk) <a href="https://twitter.com/imajoyk/status/1270769242682646529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>For Audible listeners, the yellow band on a book cover reading “only from Audible” facilitates a feeling of access to premium content, but for the rest of the book world, it’s an access barrier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It means that the audiobook in question can only be sold through Amazon’s Audible. No other retailers or providers can sell or distribute the digital audiobook, including bookstores and libraries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Books should be equally accessible to all, and Audible Exclusive audiobooks—also known as Audible Originals—are the antithesis of that.</p>



<h3><strong>How does an audiobook become an Audible Exclusive?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>This is going to get a little technical, but stick with us. It begins with the <a href="https://www.acx.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audiobook Creation Exchange (ACX)</a>, a marketplace launched by Audible in 2011 that connects narrators, authors, agents, publishers, and rights-holders to create audiobooks. The decision to make an audiobook Exclusive is made by authors, publishers, and agents—it depends on who is granted the audio rights to a book.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why do these parties choose this option? ACX offers higher royalties to creators (i.e. more money from audiobook sales) if they opt for <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.acx.com/help/what-s-the-deal/200497690" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exclusive distribution</a>. If a creator wants to distribute their audiobook to other audiobook platforms or libraries, they will earn 15% to 20% less of retail sales from ACX. The ACX system rewards exclusivity, so it’s easy to see why authors and publishers spring for this opportunity.</p>



<p>Within the ACX world, Audible Studios is the production arm of Audible. They pay authors like Mark Manson (<em>Love Is Not Enough</em>), Margaret Atwood (<em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>), and Alice Walker (<em>The Color Purple</em>) giant sums to keep their audiobooks exclusive to Audible, and prevent bookstores and libraries from selling and distributing them.</p>



<h3><strong>What does this mean for audiobook distribution?</strong></h3>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Librarian Friends: If an audio book is part of Audible's "Only on Audible" exclusive thing, does that mean people can't get the audiobook through the library? Books in the program include "Born a Crime" and "Handmaid's Tale."</p>— Hank Green: A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor is Out! (@hankgreen) <a href="https://twitter.com/hankgreen/status/1195061252730441730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Libraries, bookstores, schools, and anyone who isn’t affiliated with Amazon cannot distribute audiobooks that are Audible Exclusives. This means Libro.fm can’t sell Audible Exclusive audiobooks, which means <a href="https://libro.fm/indies?cmp=aea" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">our 1,200 bookstore partners</a> can’t sell them, either.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>Audible Exclusives also work in direct opposition to the basic principles of libraries—free access to books, both digital and print. By limiting distribution, Amazon aids in making books, perspectives, and information inaccessible to certain communities and users.</p>



<p><strong>To reiterate: There are audiobooks being published that bookstores cannot sell, and libraries cannot lend.</strong></p>



<p>This hurts bookstores because they are consistently missing out on sales for big releases. When they aren’t able to sell audiobooks that are in high demand, potential customers will opt for Audible over their local bookstores. This, of course, only continues to increase Audible’s (and ultimately Amazon’s) power and influence within the publishing industry, resulting in more Exclusive deals and increasingly restricted access to audiobooks for the rest of the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because audiobooks are a digital product, they’re inherently easier for Amazon to monopolize. For example, the superstar-stacked audiobook for <em>The Sandman </em>by Neil Gaiman and DC Comics is only available on Audible:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Full-cast audiobook Sandman adaptation is a FANTASTIC idea – that I can't even get excited about properly because it's a freaking Audible exclusive. </p><p>Which means libraries are excluded. Which means our patrons are excluded. </p><p>So that's fun. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/libcomix?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#libcomix</a></p></div>— Matthew Noe 😔💜 (@NoetheMatt) <a href="https://twitter.com/NoetheMatt/status/1260564670626365445?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Audiobooks are also a vital means of access for some readers with disabilities:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>due to disabilities, some people need audiobooks to read. people with disabilities are more likely to be underemployed/unemployed, thus they rely on the library for access to audiobooks.</p><p>amazon putting a pay wall between someone’s disabled audience and their book is hot garbage.</p></div>— whitney 🧸 (@ginkgo_ghost) <a href="https://twitter.com/ginkgo_ghost/status/1195065151243849729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<h3><strong>How else does Audible bar audiobook access?</strong></h3>



<p><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/libraries/article/80658-citing-embargo-libraries-plan-boycott-of-blackstone-digital-audio.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audible pays some publishers to embargo new audiobook releases for 90 days</a>—meaning that for the first three months of sales, the audiobook can only be found on Audible. </p>



<p>Audible also doesn’t allow Libro.fm and bookstore customers to make certain audiobooks redeemable with membership credits—books like <a href="https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9781483080703?cmp=aea" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Neapolitan Novels</a> by Elena Ferrante and <a href="https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9781094135465?cmp=aea" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Me and White Supremacy</em></a><em> </em>by Layla F. Saad.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By rewarding Exclusive distribution, striking Exclusive deals with influential authors, and paying publishers to delay the distribution of new releases, Audible’s creeping monopoly pushes independent bookstores and libraries out of the audiobook industry.</p>



<h3><strong>I’m an author. How do I prevent Amazon’s Audible from shutting out independent bookstores and libraries?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>First, understand the contract with your publisher. Are they producing the audiobook, or licensing it to another publisher? Either way, add language into your agreement that requires your audiobook to be sold through independent bookstores and made available through libraries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, if your publisher is planning to contract or license the audiobook version, ensure that your publisher puts language in their licensing agreement that prevents the audiobook publisher from selling your title exclusively to Amazon’s Audible. If your audiobook is currently Exclusive, you might be able to change the distribution rights after a year depending on the payment option you have chosen. Learn more <a href="https://www.acx.com/help/contracts-agreements/200474550#change-contract">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>How is this any different from television and movie streaming platforms that produce originals?</strong></h3>



<p>Most original series and movies are still available to loan from your public library, and you can purchase DVDs online. The level of accessibility to all is much higher. Audible Exclusive audiobooks are only available through Amazon’s platform and not available through libraries or bookstores.</p>



<h3><strong>How can we work together to make change?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<h4>1. <strong>Make the #AudiobookSwitch.</strong></h4>



<p>When you choose Libro.fm over Audible, you support our 1,200 bookstore partners, invest in your local community, and get audiobook recommendations from real booksellers—not an algorithm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By spending money with intention, we can collectively work to not let audiobooks become another form of privatized entertainment controlled by a single entity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make the <a href="https://libro.fm/switch?cmp=aea">switch from Audible to Libro.fm</a>. The more people we move away from their platform, the more power we take away from a singular provider in the industry. With Libro.fm, you get to choose a local bookstore to support, so you’re putting money back into your community.</p>







<h4><strong>2. Reach out to authors and publishers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p><a href="https://libro.fm/authors?cmp=aea">Authors</a> can change the story by ditching Audible, so reach out or tag authors on social media who have chosen the Exclusive path and share your feelings. Sharing this post with them might be a good place to start, perhaps with the statement “Choosing Audible Exclusive for your audiobook restricts audience access and hurts bookstores and libraries.”</p>



<p>We recommend <a href="https://www.authorsrepublic.com/">Author’s Republic</a> as the ACX alternative. Their audiobooks will be available on Libro.fm, libraries, and wherever audiobooks are sold or distributed. Publishers can also produce their own audiobooks and distribute to Libro.fm via <a href="https://www.ingramcontent.com/publishers/lp/coresource-audio">Ingram Plus</a>, <a href="https://findaway.com/">Findaway</a>, and <a href="https://zebralution.com/en/">Zebralution</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>3. Spread the word.</h4>



<p>Share this blog post to help educate others on this issue. You can even reshare <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDKCRKGgZBn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our Instagram post to your Story</a> or <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/librofm/status/1287833557784649728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retweet our tweet</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re a member, tell your friends, family, colleagues, and everyone you know about Libro.fm—when you refer someone, you get free audiobooks. We also offer bulk audiobook purchases for organizations.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Even if you don’t make an account with Libro.fm, it’s important that people are informed and aware of the harmful tactics that Amazon’s Audible uses to control the audiobook market. When you choose Libro.fm over Audible, you support our 1,200 bookstore partners, invest in your local community, and get audiobook recommendations from real booksellers—not an algorithm.&nbsp;</p>

It is human nature that when we are simply given information, like on a tour, it can be<strong> difficult to retain</strong>. We are much more likely to retain information when we <strong>complete the task ourselves</strong>, and product walkthroughs exploit that.</p><p>Product walkthroughs are very similar to user setup experiences, which take you through the steps required to register to use a product – such as providing an email, setting up a password, uploading a profile picture, and so forth. But these are generally considered separate parts of the user onboarding experience.&nbsp;</p><p>This is because user setup is<strong> a one-off task</strong> that needs to be completed by a new user, but they do not need to retain the knowledge to complete this task repeatedly. <strong>User expectations</strong> for setup and walkthrough are also quite different. For setup, users generally expect to be spoon-fed and to follow fairly rigid instructions. Users tend to be <strong>less patient</strong> when it comes to using <strong>the product itself</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-1160x373.jpg" alt="what is product walkthrough" loading="lazy" data-src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-1160x373.jpg" data-srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough.jpg 1400w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px" srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough.jpg 1400w"></figure><h2 id="who">Which products should use Walkthroughs?</h2><p>Teaching users how to use products is <strong>always essential </strong>for success, but the best way to teach a user how to engage <strong>depends </strong>on the product.</p><p>Specifically, product walkthroughs tend to be highly structured and rigid, and therefore work best when there is more or less only<strong> one single route</strong> to gaining value for the product. Walkthroughs are highly effective in helping users <strong>discover </strong>the steps on that route.</p><p>Walkthroughs can be less effective for more creative products, for which there are many options.</p><p>For example, take a design tool such as<strong> Canva</strong>. There are hundreds of different design templates, and thousands of different feature options. Walking them through a generic design task is <strong>unlikely</strong> to show the user how to do what they actually want to do.</p><p>That’s why Canva starts with <strong>one design at first </strong>in their product walkthrough, which is something you should keep in mind; <strong>you can split product walkthroughs</strong> in different pieces. More on this later…</p><p>That said, the utility of interactive walkthroughs is <strong>not limited</strong> to onboarding new users. They can also be effectively leveraged to<strong> instruct existing users</strong> about updates and new features. You can target walkthroughs at <strong>different user segments</strong>. For example, you could have:</p><ul><li>Walkthroughs for <strong>new users</strong>;</li><li>Walkthroughs for all users after the <strong><a href="https://userguiding.com/blog/new-feature-announcement/">launch of an important new feature</a></strong>;</li><li>Walkthroughs for users that have been <strong>using the product for a month or so</strong>, but still haven’t advanced beyond the basic features, showing them some of the more complex things they can do;</li><li>Walkthroughs for <strong>users returning</strong> to the product after a long break.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-1160x373.jpg" alt="how to create product walkthrough" loading="lazy" data-src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-1160x373.jpg" data-srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2.jpg 1400w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px" srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2.jpg 1400w"></figure><h2 id="howto">Create the Perfect Product Walkthrough in 3 Steps</h2><p>Now, there are <strong>3 steps</strong> to creating <strong>product walkthroughs that can make you stand out in the competition.</strong></p><h3 id="ftoc-heading-4"><strong>1- Start with your Value Metric</strong></h3><p>The best product walkthroughs aim to get users to their <strong>aha moment</strong> – the moment when the product is delivering value for the user – as quickly as possible.</p><p>What that moment is, very much <strong>depends </strong>on the product.</p><p>Take Instagram for example: is the value moment liking someone else’s photo, publishing your own photo, or having the photo that you published liked by someone else?</p><p>Product owners should be digging deep into their <strong>analytics</strong> to identify what the value metric for their product is. This is what point of engagement that the user needs to reach within the product for them to <strong>understand its value to them</strong>, and therefore be more likely to continue using the product than abandon it.</p><p>For example, Twitter has determined that users that follow at least 20 accounts within the first three days of joining the platform and<strong> much more likely to become regular users</strong>. So their onboarding approach is focused on<strong> getting users to this point</strong>.</p><p>Walkthroughs should focus on getting people to complete the task that they need to get to this value point as well. For an online store product, it might be the user listing their first product. For task management software, it might be setting up and sharing the first task.</p><h3 id="ftoc-heading-5"><strong>2- Define the Barriers</strong></h3><p><strong>No one likes to be spoon-fed</strong>, it can feel patronizing and like a waste of time. A rigid walkthrough can seem like a bother rather than a help if the route to success doesn’t have barriers.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, you shouldn’t need your camera all on your phone to show you how to take a photo, switch to video, or switch between front and back cameras. All of those steps should be <strong>obvious from the UI</strong>. Instruction could be more useful when it comes to more sophisticated features, but the user has probably already met their value metric at this point, so <strong>will they be interested?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Onboarding should<strong> focus on</strong> what, if anything, is standing between the user and getting to their <strong>value point</strong>, and be designed to guide the user past those <strong>obstacles.</strong> Identifying these obstacles will probably require a bit of <a href="https://userguiding.com/blog/user-research/">user research</a>, <a href="https://userguiding.com/blog/usability-testing/">usability testing</a>, and seeing where they struggle. This process does not have to be time-consuming – research shows that we tend to identify <strong>80 percent of usability issues</strong> from the first five user tests.</p><p>Common barriers include:</p><ul><li>Users are<strong> unaware</strong> of the most important features, where they are, and how to use them.</li><li>Users<strong> do not understand the value </strong>that they will gain from using particular features.</li><li>Users are <strong>missing important steps</strong> along the way to completing a vital task.</li><li>They <strong>overestimate</strong> how difficult it will be to reach a certain point.</li><li>They <strong>do not understand the terminology</strong> used.</li></ul><p>Once these barriers have been identified, you will have a good idea of what needs to go into the walkthrough (and whether a walkthrough is the best approach for educating your users).</p><h3 id="ftoc-heading-6"><strong>3- Design</strong></h3><p>Just as much attention should be paid to the design of a walkthrough as the product itself, as it can <strong>make all the difference </strong>when it comes to successfully onboarding users.</p><p>It should be developed iteratively and tested with users, just like every other feature of the product. <strong>The best product walkthroughs are:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Clear </strong>– they tell the user <strong>exactly how</strong> to use the features, and don’t do things such as rely on unexplained jargon.</li><li><strong>Concise </strong>– users want to get to the value point as quickly as possible, so walkthroughs should be comprehensive, but as<strong> short</strong> as possible.</li><li><strong>Engaging </strong>– interactive walkthroughs should already be engaging, by definition, they require users to interact and complete tasks. The tasks should be meaningful. The amount of guidance appropriate to the complexity of the step in question, graphically appealing, and using appropriate language.</li><li><strong>Skippable </strong>– not everyone wants to have to complete a walkthrough before using a product. They may have used the product before, they may be an expert. While you have identified the barriers that exist for most users, they will not exist for all.</li><li><strong>Additional Support</strong> – on the flip side, for some users the walkthrough may not be enough, and they might need more support. This should always be clearly accessible within the walkthrough, for example, a live chat feature.</li></ul><h2 id="examples">3 Examples of Great Product Walkthroughs</h2><p>Know that we know the principles of a good walkthrough, what does it look like in practice?

<p><span>When I saw a couple of years ago the demo of Google Duplex, the beta version of Google Assistant, it was a truly jaw-dropping moment to me (and many others). Perhaps you remember the dialog:</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span>(phone rings) Hi how can I help you?</span></li>
<li><span>“Hi, I’m calling to book a women’s haircut for a client, I’m looking for something on May 3rd.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Sure, give me one second.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Mm-hmm.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Sure what time are you looking for around?”</span></li>
<li><span>“At 12 pm.”</span></li>
<li><span>“We do not have a 12 pm available. The closest we have to that is a 1:15.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Do you have anything between 10 am and 12 pm?”</span></li>
<li><span>“Depending on what service she would like. What service is she looking for?”</span></li>
<li><span>“Just a woman’s haircut, for now.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Okay we have a 10 o’clock.”</span></li>
<li><span>“10 a.m. is fine.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Okay, what’s her first name?”</span></li>
<li><span>“The first name is Lisa.”</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>Which one was the machine? And hearing the voices was even eerier, as the machine voice (the one booking the appointment) sounded so, so real, including human hesitations, filler words, and so on.</span></p>

<p><span>You can reckon that such a (non-scripted) dialog is a technical feat. As Yaniv Leviathan of Google puts it, “When people talk to each other, they use more complex sentences than when talking to computers. They often correct themselves mid-sentence, are more verbose than necessary, or omit words and rely on context instead”.</span></p>

<p><span>But what I want to check now is the following question: </span><b>if voice assistants are going to have these amazing dialog capabilities, could they be our next language teachers?</b></p>

<p><span>This question is not rhetorical; it makes economic sense. You see, the online English language market is now in the order of several billion dollars a year and rising, and services like online tutors (with sites and apps like Italki, Verbling, etc.) are becoming increasingly popular.</span></p>

<p><span>But private tutors are not cheap: at an average cost of $20 dollars per lesson, taking a minimum of one lesson a week cumulates to a hefty cost of a grand per year. Not for most of us, I guess.</span></p>

<p><span>The cost of voice assistants, in contrast, is close to zero. They run from servers based on the cloud (with ever dropping costs) and talk to the final users through their smartphones, which most people have. Yes, in case you think smartphones are for the wealthy, let me show you the figures: more than 3 billion people have a smartphone, even budget communities like Latin America (with 500 million smartphones) and India (with 400 million smartphones).</span></p>

<p><span>Imagine this: instead of playing the silly vocabulary games of Duolingo, having </span><b>voice lessons</b><span> with an app that even corrects your pronunciation mistakes –without you feeling vexed, because it’s not even a human.</span></p>

<p><span>You know, last year, in a language practice Meetup I met a guy who had been 2 years studying French with Duolingo. Well, the dude was completely unable to put a single spoken sentence together! After studying daily for two years! Is this fair?&nbsp;</span><span>In another post, I’ll discuss Duolingo and its tech, but for now, we can see the problem: Duolingo doesn’t make you speak, you tap the screen of your phone and solve mini-games that aim to expand your vocabulary. But when you want to speak with someone, what happens? You freeze, no help from those silly word games.</span></p>

<p><span>Now, voice-assistant language teachers would be not only very cheap but also effective: you learn to talk by talking. Just answer</span><b> with your voice</b><span> the questions asked by your synthetic tutor, engage with the conversation, follow its advice, and learn to speak! Instead of starting by memorizing the conjugation tables, first, the assistant would give you several examples where you can see a pattern in a </span><b>real-life</b><span> context.</span></p>

<p><span>Wait a moment, will this make Italki and all other live tutor services call for bankruptcy and put thousands of tutors into unemployment?</span></p>

<p><span>Not so fast.</span></p>

<p><span>Voice assistants are advancing, no doubt, but speech recognition is not yet at a human level, especially for people who are learning the language. When I started using Siri, some years ago, it “recognized” phrases completely wrong (mostly my fault, of course). I tried to say “what time is it in London?” and it got “What is it in the law?”, and then showed a Google search page for that phrase. Mmmhhhh…</span></p>

<p><span>The lower the level of the language student is, the more difficult it is to recognize what s/he&nbsp;</span><span>is trying to say. Pronunciation is not the only problem: the phrase being spoken could be ill-constructed in the first place. We humans often guess, using the context, the speaker’s intention: if s/he is getting into a bar and approaches the barman, whatever s/he says could be related to asking for a drink. But to use the context is not easy for a machine. At least not for the moment.</span></p>

<p><span>The other missing piece is to put together a set of (flexible) scripts for specific language lessons, which falls in the territory of AI tutors. Though not trivial, there is a huge body of research on AI tutors, and I think it’s perfectly doable having the needed budget.</span></p>

<p><span>So, the short answer is YES, in a few years we will have voice assistant AI-based synthetic tutors which will mostly eliminate the need for human private tutors (except for the wealthy).</span></p>

<p><span>Notice I’m not talking about today’s half-baked systems like Mondly, which is way too rigid, lacks true ability to recognize the student speech, has dialogs with almost no options, and though it looks good (especially on a VR headset) it’s not at all what we are talking about. Perhaps voice assistants could be incorporated into VR systems like we intend to do with our Avalinguo VR system, wherein some virtual rooms there could be a synthetic tutor leading the sessions, providing feedback, suggesting discussion topics, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span>Please mark my words: </span><b>in less than 5 years from now</b><span> there will be at least one language-learning service with lessons verbally given by a voice assistant, who will be able to guide you through the lesson, have a practice conversation with you, and correct your mistakes. This technology will be likely to remedy the “<a href="https://avalinguo.com/the-talking-gap/">talking gap</a>” I wrote about in a previous blog post.</span></p>

          An overview of neural net architectures beyond the U-Net <a href="#an-overview-of-neural-net-architectures-beyond-the-u-net">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>Innovation in neural networks often happens through architectural change. In fact, architectural change is arguably what popularized deep neural networks (DNNs). The convolutional variety of DNNs had their first mainstream success in 1989 for classification in a now-antiquated model called the <a href="http://yann.lecun.org/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-89e.pdf">LeNet</a>. In 2012, the <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf">AlexNet</a> was introduced for a more difficult dataset, but the blocks which composed the AlexNet were mostly the same as the blocks which composed the LeNet. The innovation of the AlexNet was mostly in how the blocks were situated with respect to one another and the number of blocks used—in other words, the architecture<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>If architecture plays such an important role in performance, it is natural to ask how to choose an architecture. In computer vision there have been a slew of papers that introduce both radically different architectures and incremental improvements. In medical image segmentation, however, the architecture often seems to default to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf">U-Net</a>.</p>

<p>The U-Net is a simple-to-implement DNN architecture that has been wildly successful in medical imaging; the paper that introduces the U-Net, published in 2015, is the most cited paper at the prestigious medical imaging conference MICCAI. Over the past five years, however, there have been significant improvements to architectures for segmentation tasks, and it is no longer safe to assume that the U-Net will provide near state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>This article will provide an overview of the U-Net, explaining why it works and why it is the default, and then it discusses a few more recent architectures which are promising for medical imaging applications.</p>
    
      <h2 id="what-is-the-u-net-and-why-is-it-so-popular">
        
        
          What is the U-Net and why is it so popular? <a href="#what-is-the-u-net-and-why-is-it-so-popular">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>The U-Net is a 2D or 3D fully-convolutional neural network architecture that consists of an encoder and a decoder with skip connections that connect the two at various levels of feature abstraction.</p>

<p>The encoder consists of convolutional layers along with progressive downsampling which captures contextual information about the input in a compressed representation. The decoder consists of convolutional layers with progressive upsampling which, along with the skip connections, preserves sharp boundaries and structural information about the input image.  Figure 1 shows an example of a U-Net architecture.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://innolitics.com/img/articles/segmentation-overview/unet.svg" alt="U-Net architecture">
    <figcaption>Figure 1: U-Net architecture</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The purpose of downsampling—in this case via max-pooling—in the decoder is not only to increase the receptive field<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> of the network, but make it computationally and memory efficient to create a large number of convolutional feature maps. More feature maps means the network can learn more complex relationships between the input and output.</p>

<p>The purpose of upsampling is to restore the spatial structure in the output so the prediction corresponds pixel- or voxel-wise to the input. This correspondence wouldn’t otherwise be the case due to downsampling. The skip connections restore the spatial structure at every level.</p>

<p>The downsampling and upsampling encoder-decoder structure combines to make the U-Net have a large receptive field while maintaining spatial structure in the prediction.</p>

<p>The U-Net is ubiquitous in medical imaging conferences and journal articles. The apparent reason is that it is established to work reasonably well and the model is easy to implement. Consequently it is a go-to for prototyping. As opposed to some of the other models that I will discuss, the U-Net can be written in PyTorch in a few lines, which makes it quick to prop up and debug.</p>

<p>For an example implementation, see <a href="https://gist.github.com/jcreinhold/ba65d56a15386dd6ffafc1a4798078e9">here</a>. I tried to keep the implementation short without doing anything outright barbarous. For intuition as to why this network is so often used, that example implementation took me about 30 minutes from scratch (although I’ve implemented this several times before).</p>
    
      <h2 id="what-are-the-alternatives">
        
        
          What are the alternatives? <a href="#what-are-the-alternatives">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>What options does a deep learning practitioner in medical imaging have outside of the U-Net? We’ll start from the beginning with the ResNet, a now-classic architecture, and move on to more recent architectures that build on the encoder-decoder architecture of the U-Net.</p>
    
      <h2 id="alternative-1-resnet">
        
        
          Alternative 1: ResNet <a href="#alternative-1-resnet">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>The ResNet architecture introduced residual connections—similar to the skip connections of the U-Net—which made it possible to train architectures with many more convolutional layers. The residual connections added the features of earlier layers to later ones so that the convolutional layers only had to learn the difference (that is, the <em>residual</em>). This can be seen in the equation below, where x is the input, y is the output, and f is the residual layer.</p>



<p>This trick helped solve a long-standing problem of getting backpropagation to update the weights of early layers in very deep neural networks.</p>

<p>The ResNet was initially proposed for classification tasks, and thus was a straight-forward architecture composed of residual blocks and pooling layers to downsample the input to an output vector shaped according to the number of target classes. The downsampling and lack of upsampling layers make this architecture not immediately transferable to segmentation, but the architecture can be modified to do so.</p>

<p>Another problem with this network for medical imaging purposes is that the implementations of the network are for 2D networks. When working with 3D images like MR and CT, you’ll either need to use a 2D or 2.5D method of slice extraction to fit the images into the network. Given that the architectures that we will discuss in the remainder of this article are created for natural images, this 2D dimension problem persists; however, all of the mentioned 2D networks can be converted into 3D networks by replacing 2D convolutions, pooling, and other layers for their 3D equivalents. This conversion can make the number of parameters explode, and the resulting network can be infeasible to train due to memory-constraints. Nevertheless, it is usually straight-forward to modify the hyperparameters so as to create a working 3D model from a 2D one.</p>
    
      <h2 id="alternative-2-deeplabv3">
        
        
          Alternative 2: DeepLabv3+ <a href="#alternative-2-deeplabv3">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.02611.pdf">DeepLabv3+</a> architecture is one way to modify the ResNet for semantic segmentation. There are several modifications, but the one most relevant to our purposes is the modification to be an encoder-decoder with skip connections (akin to the U-Net). This is done by making the ResNet into the encoder and adding additional upsampling layers to form the decoder. Skip connections use features from intermediate layers of the ResNet and concatenate them to intermediate features in the decoder. See Fig. 2 for a block diagram of the architecture (look at the original paper for a description of the ASPP block).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://innolitics.com/img/articles/segmentation-overview/deeplabv3plus.svg" alt="DeepLabv3+ architecture">
    <figcaption>Figure 2: DeepLabv3+ architecture</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another important modification is that the architecture uses dilated convolutions instead of downsampling to increase the receptive field. See Fig. 3 for an example of a dilated convolution, where the shaded blue squares in the array on the bottom show the kernel of the dilated convolution (mapping to the shaded teal square on the top array).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://innolitics.com/img/articles/segmentation-overview/dilation.gif" alt="Dilated convolution">
    <figcaption>Figure 3: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07285">Dilated convolution</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The benefit of dilated convolution is the size of the feature map is kept constant while increasing the receptive field. While keeping the feature maps a constant size is more computationally and memory inefficient, the resulting dense features make it easier to resolve small objects in the input image—an important characteristic for segmentation.</p>

<p>These two modifications have been shown to produce state-of-the-art performance on many semantic segmentation datasets in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452109420301172">medical</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8620285">imaging</a>. While the network is large in terms of numbers of parameters and computationally expensive to run, this architecture has the benefit of using a ResNet as the encoder which can be found pre-trained in all of the most common deep learning frameworks (for example, PyTorch and Tensorflow). Using a pre-trained network can often reduce the training time or improve the robustness of the network on an underlying task (as discussed in our previous article on <a href="https://innolitics.com/articles/self-supervised-learning/">self-supervised learning</a>).</p>

<p>There are many implementations of this network that are freely available, but many of the PyTorch implementations we found were difficult to follow, so <a href="https://gist.github.com/jcreinhold/faff34dc075bdbfe7d85bf2b16249516">we implemented our own</a> that attempts to maximize code reuse from the PyTorch vision repository.</p>
    
      <h2 id="alternative-3-tiramisu">
        
        
          Alternative 3: Tiramisu <a href="#alternative-3-tiramisu">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>The main contribution of the ResNet—the use of residual connections—begged the question: If it is good to connect previous layers output to later layers, is it better to connect all previous layers to all future ones? It turns out, in some applications, that the answer was yes. The <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Huang_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf">DenseNet</a>, composed of several densely-connected (in terms of residual connections) blocks, improved the performance on image classification tasks. An example of a densely-connected block is shown in Fig. 4. Like the ResNet, however, DenseNets were designed for classification and need to be modified for semantic segmentation.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://innolitics.com/img/articles/segmentation-overview/denseblock.svg" alt="Example densely-connected block">
    <figcaption>Figure 4: Example densely-connected block</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09326.pdf">Tiramisu</a> architecture blends together the DenseNet and the encoder-decoder with skip connections structure of the U-Net to get the benefits of the densely-connected convolutional layers, as well as the greater spatial-structure-preserving aspects of the U-Net.</p>

<p>The idea of how to blend the two architectures together is simple, but it works well for <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-32248-938">medical image analysis applications</a>. The idea is simply to replace the convolutional blocks of the …</p></div></div></div>

				<p><em>I have built a custom search functionality for this blog,
based on Java and the Apache Lucene full-text search library,
compiled into a native binary using the Quarkus framework and GraalVM.
It is deployed as a Serverless application running on AWS Lambda,
providing search results without any significant cold start delay.
If you thought Java wouldn’t be the right language for this job, keep reading;
in this post I’m going to give an overview over the implementation of this feature and my learnings along the way.</em></p>
<p>Having a search functionality for my blog has been on my mind for quite some time;
I’d like to give users the opportunity to find specific contents on this blog right here on this site, without having to use an external search engine.
That’s not only nice in terms of user experience, but also having insight into the kind of information readers look for on this blog should help me to identify interesting things to write about in the future.</p>
<p>Now this blog is a static site — generated using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> — which makes this an interesting challenge.
I didn’t want to rely on an external search service
(see "Why No External Search Service" below for the reasoning),
and also a purely client-side solution as described in this <a href="https://endler.dev/2019/tinysearch/">excellent blog post</a> didn’t seem ideal.
While technically fascinating, I didn’t like the fact that it requires shipping the entire search index to the client for executing search queries.
Also things like result highlighting, customized result scoring, word stemming, fuzzy search and more seemed a bit more than I’d be willing to implement on the client.</p>
<p>All these issues have largely been solved on the server-side by libraries such as <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Apache Lucene</a> for quite some time.
Using a library like Lucene means implementing a custom server-side process, though.
How to deploy such service?
Operating a VM 24/7 with my search backend for what’s likely going to be not more than a few dozen queries per month seemed a bit like overkill.</p>
<p>So after some consideration I decided to implement my own search functionality,
based on the highly popular Apache Lucene library,
deployed as a Serverless application,
which is started on-demand if a user runs a query on my website.
In the remainder of this post I’m going to describe the solution I came up with and how it works.</p>
<p>If you like, you can try it out right now, this post is about this little search input control at the top right of this page!</p>

<p>Why No External Search Service?</p>
<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/gunnarmorling/status/1284925378868518913">tweeting</a> about my serverless search experiment, one of the questions was "What’s wrong with <a href="https://www.algolia.com/">Algolia</a>?".
To be very clear, there’s nothing wrong with it at all.
External search services like Algolia, <a href="https://developers.google.com/custom-search">Google Custom Search</a>, or an Elasticsearch provider such as <a href="https://bonsai.io/">Bonsai</a> promise an easy-to-use, turn-key search functionality which can be a great choice for your specific use case.</p>
<p>However, I felt that none of these options would provide me the degree of control and customizability I was after.
I also ruled out any "free" options, as they’d either mean having ads or paying for the service with the data of myself or that of my readers.
And to be honest, I also just fancied the prospect of solving the problem by myself, instead of relying on an off-the-shelf solution.</p>

<h2 id="_why_serverless">Why Serverless?</h2>
<div>
<p>First of all, let’s discuss why I opted for a Serverless solution.
It boils down to three reasons:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Security:</em> While it’d only cost a few EUR per month to set up a VM with a cloud provider like Digital Ocean or Hetzner, having to manage a full operating system installation would require too much of my attention; I don’t want someone to mine bitcoins or doing other nasty things on a box I run, just because I failed to apply some security patch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Cost:</em> Serverless does not only promise to scale-out (and let’s be honest, there likely won’t be millions of search queries on my blog every month), but also scale-to-zero.
As Serverless is pay-per-use and there are free tiers in place e.g. for AWS Lambda,
this service ideally should cost me just a few cents per month</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Learning Opportunity:</em> Last but not least, this also should be a nice occasion for me to dive into the world of Serverless, by means of designing, developing and running a solution for a real-world problem, exploring how Java as my preferred programming language can be used for this task</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_solution_overview">Solution Overview</h2>
<div>
<p>The overall idea is quite simple: there’s a simple HTTP service which takes a query string,
runs the query against a Lucene index with my blog’s contents and returns the search results to the caller.
This service gets invoked via JavaScript from my static blog pages,
where results are shown to the user.</p>
<p>The Lucene search index is read-only and gets rebuilt whenever I update the blog.
It’s baked into the search service deployment package,
which that way becomes fully immutable.
This reduces complexities and the attack surface at runtime.
Surely that’s not an approach that’s viable for more dynamic use cases,
but for a blog that’s updated every few weeks, it’s perfect.
Here’s a visualization of the overall flow:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.morling.dev/images/serverless_search_overview.png" alt="Serverless Search Solution Overview">
</p>
</div>
<p>The search service is deployed as a Serverless function on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a>.
One important design goal for me is to avoid lock-in to any specific cloud provider:
the solution should be portable and also be usable with container-based Serverless approaches like <a href="https://knative.dev/">Knative</a>.</p>
<p>Relying on a Serverless architecture means its start-up time must be a matter of milli-seconds rather than seconds,
so to not have a user wait for a noticeable amount of time in case of a cold start.
While <a href="https://www.morling.dev/blog/building-class-data-sharing-archives-with-apache-maven/">substantial improvements</a> have been made in recent Java versions to improve start-up times,
it’s still not ideal for this kind of use case.
Therefore, the application is compiled into a native binary via <a href="https://quarkus.io/">Quarkus</a> and <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM</a>,
which results in a start-up time of ~30 ms on my laptop, and ~180 ms when deployed to AWS Lambda.
With that we’re in a range where a cold start won’t impact the user experience in any significant way.</p>
<p>The Lambda function is exposed to callers via the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">AWS API Gateway</a>,
which takes incoming HTTP requests, maps them to calls of the function and converts its response into an HTTP response which is sent back to the caller.</p>
<p>Now let’s dive down a bit more into the specific parts of the solution.
Overall, there are four steps involved:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em><a href="#_data_extraction">Data extraction:</a></em> The blog contents to be indexed must be extracted and converted into an easy-to-process data format</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><a href="#_search_backend_implementation">Search backend implementation:</a></em> A small HTTP service is needed which exposes the search functionality of Apache Lucene, which in particular requires some steps to enable Lucene being used in a native GraalVM binary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><a href="#_wiring_things_up">Integration with the website:</a></em> The search service must be integrated into the static site on GitHub Pages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><a href="#_deployment_to_aws_lambda">Deployment:</a></em> Finally, the search service needs to be deployed to AWS API Gateway and Lambda</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>The first step was to obtain the contents of my blog in an easily processable format.
Instead of requiring something like a real search engine’s crawler,
I essentially only needed to have a single file in a structured format which then can be passed on to the Lucene indexer.</p>
<p>This task proved rather easy with Hugo;
by means of a <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/output-formats/#output-formats-for-pages">custom output format</a> it’s straight-forward to produce a JSON file which contains the text of all my blog pages.
In my <em>config.toml</em> I declared the new output format and activate it for the homepage
(largely inspired by this <a href="https://xdeb.org/post/2017/06/11/make-hugo-generate-a-json-search-index-and-json-feed/">write-up</a>):</p>

<p>The template in <em>layouts/_default/list.searchindex.json</em> isn’t too complex either:</p>

{{- range $index, $element := .Site.Pages -}}

<div>
<p>My stack of choice for this kind of application is Quarkus.
As a <a href="https://quarkus.io/guides/kafka-streams-guide">contributor</a>, I am of course biased, but Quarkus is ideal for the task at hand:
built and optimized from the ground up for implementing fast-starting and memory-efficient cloud-native and Serverless applications,
it makes building HTTP services, e.g. based on JAX-RS, running on GraalVM a trivial effort.</p>
<p>Now typically a Java library such as Lucene will not run in a GraalVM native binary out-of-the-box.
Things like reflection or JNI usage require specific configuration,
while other Java features like method handles are only supported partly or not at all.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="_apache_lucene_in_a_graalvm_native_binary">Apache Lucene in a GraalVM Native Binary</h3>
<p>Quarkus enables a wide range of popular Java libraries to be used with GraalVM,
but at this point there’s no extension yet which would take care of Lucene.
So I set out to implement a small Quarkus extension for Lucene.
Depending on the implementation details of the library in question, this can be a more or less complex and time-consuming endeavor.
The workflow is like so:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>compile down an application using the library into a native image</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>run into some sort of …</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

The whole debate revolves around trusting Apple with users’ privacy and security. Many pro-Apple fanbois agree that users should let Apple decide what is best for them while the anti-camp says that kill switch is the way forward.</p><p>Apple may never offer a kill switch for the webcam on its MacBooks, but a Linux laptop maker, Purism is making kill switches its USP for selling its laptops.&nbsp;&nbsp;Purism is a Linux laptop maker that is huge on privacy and security. On 24th July Purism had announced that it will offer the Librem 14 PureOS power Linux laptops with BIOS kill switch which would give users <a href="https://puri.sm/posts/librem-14-features-bios-and-ec-write-protection/">BIOS and EC flash chip write protection</a>.</p><p>Now the company CFO, <a href="https://puri.sm/posts/librem-14-adds-microphone-kill-switch-enhancements/">Kyle Rankin has announced that Librem 14</a> will also feature a Microphone kill switch including even for those that are connected through the headphone jack. The Microphone kill switch will provide users physically disallow any spyware, hacker, or malware from using the microphone. If the Librem 14 user uses headsets with a built-in microphone, this kill switch disables the mic but leaves the audio to work properly so the user can continue to listen to any sound that comes through this port.</p><blockquote><p>With the Librem 14 we have enhanced this kill switch so that it also disables the microphone in the headphone jack while leaving audio out unaffected. That way if you happen to leave a headset plugged in–which is common in the age of quarantined video chats–you can use the hardware kill switch to disable all microphones, even ones connected through the headphone jack.</p><p>Kyle Rankin</p></blockquote><p>The Librem 14 is a 14 inch Linux PureOS powered laptop with Intel Core i7 10710U processor. The Librem 14 is priced at $1499 but the company is offering a flat $300 discount if you <a href="https://shop.puri.sm/shop/librem-14/">pre-order before August 7, 2020</a>.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

Outsource the trust of uptime to these services where some poor bot(s) have been assigned the mundane work of periodically hitting a service endpoint.</p><p> \[Uptime = {timeUp \over (timeUp + timeDown)}\%\]</p><p>This introduces two compromises:</p><ul><li>Uptime is now as the monitor sees it,&nbsp;<strong>Not</strong>&nbsp;how the real customer sees it. Those 1% of ISP faults may still be affected.</li><li>How about the reliability of the uptime monitor? If we have trouble staying up 100% of the time, sure they cannot be up 100% of the time.</li></ul><p><em>Say, uptime monitor guarantees an uptime of 99.99%, What if those 4 minutes donâ€™t overlap? For the 4 minutes that the uptime monitor was down for, the service may be up or down, the monitor would not know.</em></p><hr><p>We donâ€™t keep all our eggs in the same basket. We introduce a multi-geography downtime monitor. Say a downtime monitor requests from 4 Geos.</p><ul><li>Should a failure across 1 Geo- be called a downtime?</li><li>What if one of the Geos is highlighting a downtime for a geographical region?</li><li>Also,&nbsp;<strong>CAP</strong>&nbsp;and Network failures.</li></ul><p>Downtime monitors arenâ€™t holier-than-thou. They go through glitches too. They need to retry too. Say if a request failed, wisdom says retry. Wisdom says Hystrix. But what about the failed attempt? Was it a failure or was it counted as success?</p><p>Before we proceed, there is a frequency too. How often do we check? We cannot go per second. We cannot go per minute. Itâ€™s a balance that we pick.</p><ul><li>The faster we check, the shallower will be the health check.</li><li>The slower we check, the deeper can be the health check.</li></ul><p>Depth of a health check is basically a trade-off we make. A shallow check only checks for a static response. A deeper health check will check for a DB operation in and out. The DB call obviously will take considerably longer and eat a transaction. We canâ€™t have that come in every 10 seconds.</p><p><em>The frequency vs depth is an argument that doesnâ€™t have one right answer. And like other things, we may just need both.</em></p><hr><h2 id="6263"><span id="Option_3_Statebased_Monitors"></span>Option 3: State-based Monitors<span></span></h2><p>Because the uptime is not being requested every ms, we count the time between states of the service.</p><p>We need states.&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Unknown</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong>.</p><p>Error is confirmed down. The Unknown could be any emission that was interrupted or pending for retry or the duration that was in-between maintenance.</p><ul><li>Time spent between&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Unknown</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>&nbsp;since you cannot tell for sure.</li><li>Time spent between&nbsp;<strong>Unknown</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong>.</li><li>Time spent between&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Unknown</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong>&nbsp;since you cannot tell whether service is Up or not.</li><li>Similarly, the time between&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>&nbsp;is considered down, since it was down.</li></ul><p>This in itself is the first step of aggregation.</p><p>Letâ€™s take these two situations</p><ol><li>Counted as&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>&nbsp;for 20.

<p>Tesla is currently valued at 10x Price-to-Sales, and Trailing Twelve Months Price-to-Earnings of 743. This makes Tesla grossly overvalued, right? In the short term, definitely yes. But is there a way this valuation will be justified in the next 10 years?</p>



<h2><strong>High level thesis</strong></h2>



<p>I believe that at the end of this decade, Tesla will be the first $1 trillion market cap car company. Except it’s not a car company. It’s a fundemental technology company.</p>



<p>Tesla is best compared to Amazon. They started as a boring book retailer. Low margins. Complicated logistics. Nothing too exciting.</p>



<p>Who would have thought in 1997 when Amazon went public that 23 years later the business would look like it does today? There was no AWS, no Amazon Advertising, no Amazon Prime, no Amazon Marketplace, no Alexa, no Kindle. In their IPO prospectus they described themselves as “the leading online retailer of books.”</p>



<p>So what was different about Amazon? Jeff Bezos. A visionary owner-operator with an extremely long-term focus and customer obsession. </p>



<p>Exactly the same is true for Tesla. It may look like a car company today. But 10 years from now it will look very differently, thanks to Elon Musk.</p>



<h2><strong>How Tesla will look like in 2030</strong></h2>



<h4><strong>Car business</strong></h4>



<p>It’s reasonable to expect that they will keep growing volume by 35 percent per year (so far it has been &gt;50 percent). That means in 2030 they will produce about 10 million cars. With an average selling price of $25k this will generate $250 billion in revenues. If we assume a similar 5 percent net income margin as Volkswagen this would generate after-tax net income of $12.5 billion.</p>



<h4><strong>Software business</strong></h4>



<p>I expect each sold car to generate $10k worth of software revenues. Currently, the Full Self-Driving option alone sells for $8k, and there will be many in-app-purchases like the&nbsp;<a href="https://electrek.co/2019/12/19/tesla-acceleration-boost-model-3-dual-motor/">$2000 acceleration boost</a>, which is delivered over the air. This will generate $100 billion in revenues on top. With a net income margin of 20 percent this would add after-tax net income of $20 billion.</p>



<h4><strong>Ride-sharing business</strong></h4>



<p>Tesla will add ride sharing capabilities, which will enable it to earn a cut (usually 20-30%) from rides on their network.</p>



<p>That means that Tesla will not just make money from cars and software, but also make money from each mile that is driven on its ride sharing network.</p>



<p>The only question is, how big will this get? If they don’t solve full self-driving, then this will just be another version of Uber/Lyft or Zipcar or Turo. It can be substantial, but probably not huge.</p>



<p>But if, and this is still a big if, they solve full self-driving and can offer fully autonomous robotaxis, this can become gigantic, especially if they are the first ones. This is not unlikely, because they have the largest fleet and by far the largest data pool to train their neural nets.</p>



<h4><strong>Solar business</strong></h4>



<p>Tesla currently offers the lowest-cost solar panels in America. They plan to massively scale this business. They also offer a more premium solar roof option where the panels are directly integrated into the roof.</p>



<p>If we assume they scale this globally to 5 million roofs per year by 2030 and an average selling-price of $15k, this will bring in another $75 billion in revenues. With a 3 percent net income margin this would add $2 billion in after-tax net income.</p>



<h4><strong>Battery business</strong></h4>



<p>Tesla will be the undisputed leader in battery technology. Soon, they will start manufacturing their own cells, which will likely last <a href="https://www.electrek.co/2019/09/07/tesla-battery-cell-last-1-million-miles-robot-taxis/">1 million miles</a>. </p>



<p>They need cells for their cars, but also for their energy storage solutions like <a href="https://www.tesla.com/powerwall">Powerwall</a>, <a href="https://www.tesla.com/powerpack">Powerpack</a> and <a href="https://www.tesla.com/megapack">Megapack</a>. </p>



<p>A Powerwall costs $8.5k and adds energy independence and backup. Pretty much every buyer of solar panels will buy one or more, which means millions of units per year. </p>



<h4><strong>Licensing business</strong></h4>



<p>The recent positive attitude by Volkswagen chairman Herbert Diess towards Tesla (see <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/vw-ceo-lauds-musk-over-tesla-s-earnings-and-value-potential">here</a>, <a href="https://electrek.co/2020/03/02/vw-chief-adjusts-goal-from-overtaking-tesla-to-keep-as-close-as-possible/">here</a>, or <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2020/04/29/vw-ceo-is-worried-teslas-neural-network-is-far-beyond-other-auto-manufacturers/">here</a>) can only mean one thing: Volkswagen wants to potentially license Tesla’s software and technology.</p>



<p>Elon Musk confirmed his willingness to do so:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tesla is open to licensing software and supplying powertrains &amp; batteries. We’re just trying to accelerate sustainable energy, not crush competitors!</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1288265150928125952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 29, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It’s not realistic that every single car company in the world will be able to build all the necessary hardware and software in-house. </p>



<p>It will look more like computer or smartphone operating systems, dominated by two or three players. Tesla will be one of them, which will translate into substantial revenue.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>When we add everything up, Tesla will be a $500+ billion revenue company in 2030 with healthy profits. So I believe a valuation of $1 trillion is justified, leaving a 4x upside from today’s price. </p>



<p>And if they solve full self-driving and become the leading robotaxi provider, the revenue and profit from that will be substantial.</p>



<p>But make no mistake. There will be huge challenges and volatility. It won’t be a smooth ride. And there is still a “black swan” type chance that they will go bust.</p>



<p>If they are able to pull it off, I have no doubt in my mind that Tesla will become one of the largest and most important companies on the planet.</p>



<p>And who knows what other products or businesses they will come up with along the way?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Over one's education and career, a software developer learns many languages and their ecosystems.</p><p>I recently learned both <a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a> and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, and have spent the past three months writing them nearly full-time. Learning these modern languages and reflecting on ones I've used in the past has alerted me to the difference between a <i>Software
Development Language</i> and the usual term we use, <i>Programming Language</i>. This post is the first of a series that describes this difference and analyses a few languages through this lens.</p><div><p>What is a Software Development Language and how is that different from a "Programming Language"?</p><p>When talking about a language, we could say that it's fast or slow, concise or verbose, mangled or pretty, beginner-friendly or plagued by a steep learning curve. We could comment about how Language A does <code>for</code> loops <i>this way</i>, Language B does them <i>that way</i>, and Language C doesn't have them at all. But from the perspective of real-world Software Development, these points are nearly irrelevant.</p><p>Let's define a few terms to see why.</p><h3 id="orgabb3be">Definition: Programming</h3><div><blockquote><p>Programming is the manipulation of Ideas, followed by the encoding of that
manipulation into a physical form (usually code) to be executed by a Computer.</p></blockquote><p>For some broad definition of <i>Idea</i> and <i>Computer</i>. With this, the following are all programming:</p><ul><li>Writing a two-line Bash script to rename some files.</li><li>Writing a Python function to generate a plot for a Data Science class.</li><li>Editing some CSS to alter your website's layout.</li><li>Typing an SQL query into a database prompt.</li><li>Solving a <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">coding challenge</a>.</li><li>Refactoring a module to use newer idioms, reducing code by half.</li><li>Writing a patch in C for the Linux Kernel to support a USB device.</li><li>Writing an algorithm prototype with an associated academic paper.</li></ul><p>And so would these be:</p><ul><li>Writing pseudocode of a sorting algorithm on a final exam.</li><li>Linking <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">visual logic blocks</a> together to cause a fun game effect.</li><li>Establishing "forms" with associated validation rules on a <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce</a> -based data management system.</li><li>The main mechanic of the game <a href="http://www.zachtronics.com/spacechem/">SpaceChem</a>.</li><li>Controlling the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_machine">operation of a loom</a> via punchcards.</li><li>Taking a walk or a shower to solve coding problems in your mind.</li></ul><p>In this sense, the act of programming itself is available to everyone.</p></div><h3 id="org940e47">Definition: Software Development</h3><div><p>On the other hand, we have <i>Software Development</i>:</p><blockquote><p>Software Development is the creation of software to be used over time.

Programming followed by Testing, Collaborating, Releasing, and Maintenance.</p></blockquote><p>With this, the following are Software Development activities:</p><ul><li>Accepting a bug ticket at work, finding the problem, and submitting a PR for the solution.</li><li>Creating and uploading a personal website.</li><li>Developing and launching a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bubble-level-for-iphone/id465613917">phone app to help level</a> a framed picture.</li><li>Producing a game for a major gaming console.</li><li>Evaluating and merging patches to the Linux Kernel.</li><li>Updating and deploying the assembly code of a 50 year old satellite that has left the solar system.</li><li>Speaking to other developers at a conference.</li></ul><p>All languages can be measured on a scale of how sharp a tool they are for the entire Five Pillared process of Software Development, not just programming. Particularly sharp languages have solid answers to these real concerns:</p><ul><li>Programming:<ul><li>Do my ideas flow into the editor, or do the language idioms get in my way?</li><li>Is my day-to-day experience a productive dialogue with the compiler?</li><li>How many characters must I type to express my intent?</li><li>Is the language <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">filled with GOTCHAs</a>?</li><li>How short are compilation / typecheck times?</li><li>How beautiful is the syntax I look at every day?</li></ul></li><li>Testing:<ul><li>How efficiently can I discover if my code is incorrect?</li><li>Am I protected from future changes breaking old code?</li><li>Does the language itself provide correctness guarantees that avoid the need for test writing?</li><li>Are benchmarking and profiling first-class activities?</li><li>How easy does the language make it to write code that performs poorly?</li><li>How long is CI turnaround?</li></ul></li><li>Collaborating:<ul><li>How easy is it to write code that others won't understand?</li><li>When I have a question, are there well-trafficked channels to find the answer?</li><li>Is there a canonical way to write the language, or are there competing paradigms?</li><li>Can I easily incorporate other people's code into my own?</li><li>Are there meetups or conferences close to me that are dedicated to the language?</li></ul></li><li>Releasing:<ul><li>Is documentation "first class"?

To contrast, how many of these points are relevant to students, researchers, and working scientists? This brings us to our main point:</p><blockquote><p>Some languages are better suited for Software Development than others.</p></blockquote><p>Should you write a multi-million line Operating System in Python? You could, but you shouldn't. Python has other strengths.</p><p>The same is true for working in research and for learning how to program in the first place. Should you write complex, high-performance physics simulations in Java? You could, but you shouldn't. Java has other strengths. Should you teach someone C++ as their first exposure to programming? You could (and many have been), but you shouldn't. C++ has other strengths.</p></div></div><div><p>They say that a good craftsman never blames his tools. This is true, but it's also important to recognize when you're trying to build a skyscraper with a hammer, or a bikeshed with a crane. Sometimes the tools are inappropriate for the task at hand. For Software Development, we should choose a sharp Software Development Language from our toolbox.</p><p>All Software Development Languages are Programming Languages, but the reverse is not true. With all this in mind, what sense is there really in debating the syntax of a <code>for</code> loop? Or in writing the 1000th <i>FooLang vs BarLang</i> article? Or ranking the Top 100 Languages?</p><p>For me, I'll take a language that lets me create, share my creations, and keep my creations alive. Next week, we'll apply the above philosophies to Rust, and see how it measures as a Software Development Language.</p></div></div>]]>

        <p>Full-Text Search is one of those tools people use every day without realizing it. If you ever googled "golang coverage report" or tried to find "indoor wireless camera" on an e-commerce website, you used some kind of full-text search.</p>
<p>Full-Text Search (FTS) is a technique for searching text in a collection of documents. A document can refer to a web page, a newspaper article, an email message, or any structured text.</p>
<p>Today we are going to build our own FTS engine. By the end of this post, we'll be able to search across millions of documents in less than a millisecond. We'll start with simple search queries like "give me all documents that contain the word <em>cat</em>" and we'll extend the engine to support more sophisticated boolean queries.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Most well-known FTS engine is <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/" target="_blank">Lucene</a> (as well as <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch" target="_blank">Elasticsearch</a> and Solr built on top of it).</p>
</div>
<div id="why-fts">
<h3>Why FTS<a href="#why-fts" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Before we start writing code, you may ask "can't we just use <em>grep</em> or have a loop that checks if every document contains the word I'm looking for?". Yes, we can. However, it's not always the best idea.</p>
</div>
<div id="corpus">
<h3>Corpus<a href="#corpus" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>We are going to search a part of the abstract of English Wikipedia. The latest dump is available at <a href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/enwiki-latest-abstract1.xml.gz" target="_blank">dumps.wikimedia.org</a>. As of today, the file size after decompression is 913 MB. The XML file contains over 600K documents.</p>
<p>Document example:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;title&gt;</span>Wikipedia: Kit-Cat Klock<span>&lt;/title&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;url&gt;</span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit-Cat_Klock<span>&lt;/url&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;abstract&gt;</span>The Kit-Cat Klock is an art deco novelty wall clock shaped like a grinning cat with cartoon eyes that swivel in time with its pendulum tail.<span>&lt;/abstract&gt;</span></code></pre>
</div>
<div id="loading-documents">
<h3>Loading documents<a href="#loading-documents" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>First, we need to load all the documents from the dump. The built-in <span>encoding/xml</span> package comes very handy:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>"encoding/xml"</span>
    <span>"os"</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>nil</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span>

    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>docs</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Every loaded document gets assigned a unique identifier.
To keep things simple, the first loaded document gets assigned ID=0, the second ID=1 and so on.</p>

<h4>Searching the content<a href="#searching-the-content" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>Now that we have all documents loaded into memory, we can try to find the ones about cats. At first, let's loop through all documents and check if they contain the substring <em>cat</em>:</p>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>search</span><span>(</span><span>docs</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span><span>,</span> <span>term</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span> <span>{</span>

            <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>append</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>doc</span><span>)</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>r</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>On my laptop, the search phase takes 103ms - not too bad.
If you spot check a few documents from the output, you may notice that the function matches <em>caterpillar</em> and <em>category</em>, but doesn't match <em>Cat</em> with the capital <em>C</em>. That's not quite what I was looking for.</p>
<p>We need to fix two things before moving forward:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make the search case-insensitive (so <em>Cat</em> matches as well).</p></li>
<li><p>Match on a word boundary rather than on a substring (so <em>caterpillar</em> and <em>communication</em> don't match).</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="searching-with-regular-expressions">
<h4>Searching with regular expressions<a href="#searching-with-regular-expressions" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>One solution that quickly comes to mind and allows implementing both requirements is <em>regular expressions</em>.</p>
<p>Here it is - <span><span>(?i)\bcat\b</span></span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span><span>(?i)</span></span> makes the regex case-insensitive</p></li>
<li><p><span>\b</span> matches a word boundary (position where one side is a word character and another side is not a word character)</p></li>
</ul>

    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>r</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Ugh, the search took more than 2 seconds. As you can see, things started getting slow even with 600K documents. While the approach is easy to implement, it doesn't scale well. As the dataset grows larger, we need to scan more and more documents. The time complexity of this algorithm is linear - the number of documents required to scan is equal to the total number of documents. If we had 6M documents instead of 600K, the search would take 20 seconds. We need to do better than that.</p>

<div id="inverted-index">
<h3>Inverted Index<a href="#inverted-index" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>To make search queries faster, we'll preprocess the text and build an index in advance.</p>
<p>The core of FTS is a data structure called <em>Inverted Index</em>.
The Inverted Index associates every word in documents with documents that contain the word.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code><span>documents</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>"a donut on a glass plate"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>2</span><span>:</span> <span>"only the donut"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>"listen to the drum machine"</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>index</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"a"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"donut"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"on"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"glass"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"plate"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"only"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"the"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"listen"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"to"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"drum"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"machine"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Below is a real-world example of the Inverted Index. An index in a book where a term references a page number:</p>

<div id="text-analysis">
<h3>Text analysis<a href="#text-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Before we start building the index, we need to break the raw text down into a list of words (tokens) suitable for indexing and searching.</p>
<p>The text analyzer consists of a tokenizer and multiple filters.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://artem.krylysov.com/images/2020-fts/text-analysis.png">
</p></div>
<div id="tokenizer">
<h3>Tokenizer<a href="#tokenizer" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>The tokenizer is the first step of text analysis. Its job is to convert text into a list of tokens. Our implementation splits the text on a word boundary and removes punctuation marks:</p>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>tokenize</span><span>(</span><span>text</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span><span>string</span> <span>{</span>

</div>
<div id="filters">
<h3>Filters<a href="#filters" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>In most cases, just converting text into a list of tokens is not enough. To make the text easier to index and search, we'll need to do additional normalization.</p>
<div id="lowercase">
<h4>Lowercase<a href="#lowercase" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>In order to make the search case-insensitive, the lowercase filter converts tokens to lower case. <em>cAt</em>, <em>Cat</em> and <em>caT</em> are normalized to <em>cat</em>.
Later, when we query the index, we'll lower case the search terms as well. This will make the search term <em>cAt</em> match the text <em>Cat</em>.</p>

<p>Note</p>
<p>A stem is not always a valid word. For example, some stemmers may reduce <em>airline</em> to <em>airlin</em>.</p>

<p>The tokenizer and filters convert sentences into a list of tokens:</p>

<span>[</span><span>"donut"</span><span>,</span> <span>"on"</span><span>,</span> <span>"glass"</span><span>,</span> <span>"plate"</span><span>,</span> <span>"only"</span><span>,</span> <span>"donut"</span><span>]</span></code></pre>

<h3>Building the index<a href="#building-the-index" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Back to the inverted index. It maps every word in documents to document IDs.
The built-in <span>map</span> is a good candidate for storing the mapping.
The key in the map is a token (string) and the value is a list of document IDs:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> <span>index</span> <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>][]</span><span>int</span></code></pre>
<p>Building the index consists of analyzing the documents and adding their IDs to the map:</p>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>idx</span> <span>index</span><span>)</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>docs</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

                <span>// Don't add same ID twice.
</span>                <span>continue</span>
            <span>}</span>
            <span>idx</span><span>[</span><span>token</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>append</span><span>(</span><span>ids</span><span>,</span> <span>doc</span><span>.</span><span>ID</span><span>)</span>
        <span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>idx</span> <span>:=</span> <span>make</span><span>(</span><span>index</span><span>)</span>
    <span>idx</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>([]</span><span>document</span><span>{{</span><span>ID</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>Text</span><span>:</span> <span>"A donut on a glass plate. Only the donuts."</span><span>}})</span>

    <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>idx</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>It works! Each token in the map refers to IDs of the documents that contain the token:</p>
<pre><code>map[donut:[1 2] glass:[1] …</code></pre></div></article></div>

        <hr>
<p>When I started my career in development, my first job was a DBA. Back then, before AWS RDS, Azure, Google Cloud and the rest of them cloud services, there were two types of DBAs:</p>
<p><strong>The Infrastructure DBA</strong> was in charge of setting up the database, configuring the storage and taking care of backups and replication. After setting up the database, the infrastructure DBA would pop up from time to time and do some "instance tuning", things like sizing caches.</p>
<p><strong>The Application DBA</strong> got a clean database from the infrastructure DBA, and was in charge of schema design: creating tables, indexes, constraints, and tuning SQL. The application DBA was also the one who implemented ETL processes and data migrations. In teams that used stored procedures, the application DBA would maintain those as well.</p>
<p>Application DBAs were usually part of the development team. They would possess deep domain knowledge so normally they would work on just one or two projects. Infrastructure DBAs would usually be part of some IT team, and would work on many projects simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>I'm an Application DBA</strong></p>
<p>I never had any desire to fiddle with backups or tune storage (I'm sure it's fascinating!). Until this day I like to say I'm a DBA that knows how to develop applications, and not a developer that knows his way around the database.</p>
<p><strong>In this article I share some non-trivial tips about database development I gathered along the way.</strong></p>

<h2 id="update-only-what-needs-updating"><a href="#update-only-what-needs-updating">Update Only What Needs Updating</a></h2>
<p><code>UPDATE</code> is a relatively expensive operation. To speed up an <code>UPDATE</code> command it's best to make sure you only update what needs updating.</p>
<p>Take this query for example that normalizes an email column:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>users</span> <span>SET</span> <span>email</span> <span>=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>);</span>
<span>UPDATE 1010000</span>
<span>Time: 1583.935 ms (00:01.584)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Looks innocent, right? the query updated emails of 1,010,000 users. But, did all rows really needed to update?</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>users</span> <span>SET</span> <span>email</span> <span>=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>)</span>
<span><span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>email</span> <span>!=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>);</span>
</span><span>UPDATE 10000</span>
<span>Time: 299.470 ms</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Only 10,000 rows needed to update. By reducing the amount of affected rows, the execution time went down from 1.5 seconds to just less than 300ms. Updating fewer rows also saves the database maintenance later on.</p>

<p>This type of large updates are very common in data migration scripts. So the next time you write a migration script, make sure to only update what needs updating.</p>

<h2 id="disable-constraints-and-indexes-during-bulk-loads"><a href="#disable-constraints-and-indexes-during-bulk-loads">Disable Constraints and Indexes During Bulk Loads</a></h2>
<p>Constraints are an important part of relational databases: they keep the data consistent and reliable. Their benefits come at a cost though, and it's most noticeable when loading or updating a lot of rows.</p>
<p>To demonstrate, set up a small schema for a store:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>DROP</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>IF</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>product</span> <span>CASCADE</span><span>;</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>product</span> <span>(</span>

    <span>price</span> <span>INT</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>product</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>price</span><span>)</span>
    <span>SELECT</span> <span>random</span><span>()::</span><span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>random</span><span>()</span> <span>*</span> <span>1000</span><span>)::</span><span>int</span>

<span>DROP</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>IF</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>customer</span> <span>CASCADE</span><span>;</span>

    <span>customer_id</span> <span>int</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The schema defines different types of constraints such as "not null" and unique constraints.</p>
<p>To set a baseline, start by adding foreign keys to the <code>sale</code> table, and then load some data into it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>sale</span> <span>ADD</span> <span>CONSTRAINT</span> <span>sale_product_fk</span>

<span>ALTER TABLE</span>
<span>Time: 18.413 ms</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>sale</span> <span>ADD</span> <span>CONSTRAINT</span> <span>sale_customer_fk</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>FOREIGN</span> <span>KEY</span> <span>(</span><span>customer_id</span><span>)</span> <span>REFERENCES</span> <span>customer</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>);</span>
<span>ALTER TABLE</span>
<span>Time: 5.464 ms</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>sale_created_ix</span> <span>ON</span> <span>sale</span><span>(</span><span>created</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE INDEX</span>
<span>Time: 12.605 ms</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>SALE</span> <span>(</span><span>created</span><span>,</span> <span>product_id</span><span>,</span> <span>customer_id</span><span>)</span>

<span>INSERT 0 1000000</span>
<span>Time: 15410.234 ms (00:15.410)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>After defining constraints and indexes, loading a million rows to the table took ~15.4s.</p>
<p>Next, try to load the data into the table first, and only then add constraints and indexes:</p>

<p>Loading data into a table without indexes and constraints was much faster, 2.27s compared to 15.4s before. Creating the indexes and constraints after the data was loaded into the table took a bit longer, but overall the entire process was much faster, 3.1s compared to 15.4s.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for indexes PostgreSQL does not provide an easy way of doing this other than dropping and re-creating the indexes. In other databases such as Oracle, you can <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/ALTER-INDEX.html#GUID-D8F648E7-8C07-4C89-BB71-862512536558" rel="noopener">disable and enable indexes</a> without having to re-create them.</p>
<hr>

<p>When you modify data in PostgreSQL, the changes are written to the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html" rel="noopener">write ahead log (WAL)</a>. The WAL is used to maintain integrity, to fast forward the database during recovery and to maintain replication.</p>
<p>Writing to the WAL is often needed, but there are some circumstances where you might be willing to give up some of its uses to make things a bit faster. One example is intermediate tables.</p>
<p>Intermediate tables are disposable tables that stores temporary data used to implement some process. For example, a very common pattern in ETL processes is to load data from a CSV file to an intermediate table, clean the data, and then load it to the target table. In this use-case, the intermediate table is disposable and there is no use for it in backups or replicas.</p>

<p>The user <em>haki benita</em> registered twice, once with the email <code>ME@hakibenita.com</code> and again with <code>me@hakibenita.com</code>. Because we didn't normalize the emails when we inserted them into the table, we now have to deal with duplication.</p>
<p>To consolidate the duplicate users, we want to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify duplicate users by lower case email</li>
<li>Update orders to reference one of the duplicate users</li>
<li>Remove the duplicate users from the users table</li>
</ol>
<p>One way to consolidate duplicate users is to use an intermediate table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>CREATE</span> <span>UNLOGGED</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>duplicate_users</span> <span>AS</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>SELECT</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>normalized_email</span><span>,</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>convert_to_user</span><span>,</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>array_remove</span><span>(</span><span>ARRAY_AGG</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>),</span> <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>))</span> <span>as</span> <span>convert_from_users</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>users</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>normalized_email</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>HAVING</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>count</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>CREATE TABLE</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>duplicate_users</span><span>;</span>
<span> normalized_email  | convert_to_user | convert_from_users</span>
<span>-------------------+-----------------+--------------------</span>
<span> me@hakibenita.com |               2 | {3}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The intermediate table holds a mapping of duplicate users. For each user that appears more than once with the same normalized email address, we define the user with the min ID as the user we convert all duplicates to. The other users are kept in an array column, and all the references to these users will be updated.</p>
<p>Using the intermediate table, we update references of duplicate users in the <code>orders</code> table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>orders</span> <span>o</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>SET</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>du</span><span>.</span><span>convert_to_user</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>duplicate_users</span> <span>du</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>ANY</span><span>(</span><span>du</span><span>.</span><span>convert_from_users</span><span>);</span>
<span>UPDATE 2</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now that there are no more references, we can safely delete the duplicate users from the <code>users</code> table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>users</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>id</span> <span>IN</span> <span>(</span>
<span>db(#</span>        <span>SELECT</span> <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>convert_from_users</span><span>)</span>
<span>db(#</span>        <span>FROM</span> <span>duplicate_users</span>
<span>db(#</span>    <span>);</span>
<span>DELETE 1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Notice that we used the function <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-array.html#ARRAY-FUNCTIONS-TABLE" rel="noopener"><code>unnest</code></a> to "transpose" the array, that is, turn each array element into a row.</p>
<p>This is the result:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>email</span><span>,</span> <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>id</span> <span>as</span> <span>order_id</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>orders</span> <span>o</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>users</span> <span>u</span> <span>ON</span> <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span>
<span> id |       email       | order_id</span>
<span>----+-------------------+----------</span>
<span>  1 | foo@bar.baz       |        1</span>
<span>  1 | foo@bar.baz       |        2</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <p>Underlying every idea someone has lies a more subtle, hidden fantasy of what is <em>actually</em> driving them. An emotional narrative the person built around what they want to do. They’re often not aware of it.</p> <p><span>If you need to convince someone to do something, don’t pitch your idea. Instead, pitch the underlying idea <em>fantasy</em> to someone who would enjoy it.</span> Similarly, if you want to convince someone not to do something, you need to understand their true motivation.</p> <p><strong>Don’t debate at the surface.</strong> Suppose someone wants to get a new job. They’ll tell friends “they want to grow” or “don’t feel like they’re learning in their current job”. Debating the points they bring up with you won’t help because that isn’t what is <em>really</em> motivating them to leave. True motivation is often simpler: they heard a friend is making much more money than them. They met someone at the new job they really like. They haven’t been sleeping well, and they’re just tired. The fantasy that’s stuck in their mind is a mental image of themselves making more money, being near a person they admire or being more well-rested. You need to determine what that is.</p> <p><strong>Listen.</strong> Try to ascertain what the person <em>really</em> wants. This requires listening at a whole new level. When they talk, notice <span>what causes their eyes their eyes to light up.</span> Pay attention to their posture. Once you start paying attention to the details, you’ll realize other humans are the most interesting thing in the world.</p> <p><strong>Counter-position.</strong> Don’t try to compete with their fantasy. Like Kellyanne Conway answering a question, just pitch a different one. If you suspect someone the fantasy in the future job is “I will make more money”, don’t immediately offer a raise. Pitch another something else, e.g: “there will be real opportunity for public recognition in this role”. <span>Don’t make your idea comparable to another idea.</span></p> <p><strong>Direct a movie.</strong> Suppose you want someone to quit smoking. The fantasy you want to plant is how youthful they’ll feel when they stop. The most effective way to incept a person isn’t to say those words. Instead, say something like: “it must feel wonderful to run 3 miles in the wilderness, take a breath of fresh air and really live life.” <span>Conduct a movie in the mind with words that evoke vivid imagery.</span> It makes for a much more engaging conversation.</p> <p><strong>Don’t pre-suppose solutions.</strong> Instead of thinking of what you want (“you should build this thing”), think of <em>why</em> you want it (“this thing could be really successful, if someone built it”). Try to formulate a narrative around the underlying motivations for the idea, and let them think of the actual concept themselves. <span>Give context, not commands.</span></p> <p><strong>Run a simulation.</strong> Think to yourself: “what would I be thinking if I was in that position?” To do this well, you must disentangle your own motivations. <span>Take your hat off. Put theirs on. Argue against yourself with them.</span> This helps convey that you’re really trying to see the problem from their side.</p> <p><strong>Pitch theoretically.</strong> When you’re in a biased position, don’t make any direct suggestions (“you should”). Your idea may get auto-rejected because of its origin. Instead, use yourself or a theoretical stranger (“I would…”, “boy <em>somebody</em> ought to…”).</p> <p><strong>Lastly, forget about yourself.</strong> <span>People frequently make the mistake of pitching ideas that will help them, not the other party.</span> This doesn’t work. Smart people have a very strong firewall for truly embracing an idea. To pass it you must really afford the other party something that they deeply want. Not what you want. That is a secondary goal.</p> </article></div>]]>

<p><span>O</span>n June 23, Jiang opened an app called 58 Tongcheng and saw a public poll: “I quit my job in January and have been laying low at home so far. How about your first half of 2020?”</p>



<p>She suddenly got emotional. Jiang, who asked to be identified by her last name only, is 27 and lives in Nanjing, a city of eight million people in eastern China. In February, her employer of four years, a small clinic that offers beauty treatments like Botox, laid off all three of its staff workers, on account of pandemic-related economic pressure. Jiang, who had attended only vocational training after high school, found it hard to get a new job. She worked briefly for a hospital call center but quit when she was ordered to lure patients in with false promises. She enrolled in a skills-training program that cost $3,000 but felt she learned nothing new. When Jiang clicked on 58 Tongcheng’s poll, she wrote in the comments, “I’ve used up all my savings. I have no idea what to do tomorrow ever since I became unemployed. Feeling kind of lost.”</p>



<p>58 Tongcheng <a href="http://bj.58.com/">is the Chinese version of Craigslist</a> and one of the most popular websites for classifieds and job posts. But, this year, users like Jiang have turned 58 Tongcheng into a repository for unemployment grief. In the absence of media documentation of the economic upheaval created by Covid-19, the app has become an unofficial record of the depth of the country’s devastation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Officially, the Chinese <a href="http://www.stats.gov.cn/statsinfo/auto2074/202004/t20200417_1739478.html">unemployment rate has been remarkably stable</a>: 5.7% in June, less than 1% higher than the same time last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics of China. But that number has drawn suspicion from both inside and outside China. In April, Li Xunlei, then director of the research unit for Chinese security brokerage firm Zhongtai, published a report estimating a national unemployment rate of around 20%. He was <a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-05-01/zhongtai-securities-removes-research-chief-after-controversial-report-101549484.html">removed</a> from the position one week later, a decision Zhongtai claims was not related to the report.</p>



<p>Poor workers have been hit especially hard by the economic turmoil. A team of researchers led by Lu Hai, a professor of accounting at both Peking University and the University of Toronto, found that, based on public job posts, the number of available positions with a monthly salary less than 4,000 yuan (about $570) has decreased this year by 44% compared to the same period in 2019. On the upper end of the economic spectrum, the number of posts advertising jobs with compensation higher than 15,000 yuan (about $2,140), was down by only 12%. (The average monthly salary in urban regions of China was about $1,100 in 2019.) One <a href="https://www.ifpri.org/blog/lockdowns-are-protecting-chinas-rural-families-covid-19-economic-burden-heavy">study</a> of Chinese villages around Hubei, the first epicenter of the virus, found that inhabitants were spending less on food because of economic difficulty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Helping the low-income population in China is quite challenging,” Lu wrote in an email to <em>Rest of World</em>. “These are the most vulnerable people and businesses when there is a significant negative shock.”</p>



<p>58 Tongcheng, or 58.com, is uniquely positioned to shine a light on disadvantaged communities. Founded in 2005 by Jinbo Yao, a young entrepreneur who started out selling domain names, the company started as a website for people to post and find housing leads, job notices, and items for sale. It sells ads on its platform and charges businesses and individuals $1,000 to $8,000 for a yearly membership that allows them to boost their posts or listings. An app launched in 2010 does the same. It is now among the top 30 Chinese apps by number of users, according to the data analytics firm QuestMobile.</p>



<p>Recruitment is one of 58 Tongcheng’s core services. It is especially popular among blue-collar workers and their employers. In 2017, Yao told the business magazine <em>China Entrepreneur</em> that the company has a 90% market share in online blue-collar recruitment. (Many blue-collar workers still find jobs through offline connections.) That same year, the company launched 58 Town, a separate app targeting small-town populations, as part of a strategic push to attract users in China’s less-developed regions. 58 Town has ventured into 13,000 of China’s approximately 40,000 towns, according to the company’s 2019 annual report. Last year, more than half of 58 Tongcheng’s core business revenue was generated outside of the top 19 cities. (At the time of publication, the company was still listed on the New York Stock Exchange.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>58 Tongcheng’s social network feature, launched last year, is designed to give users the chance to chat outside the job search. In these “58 communities,” users talk under pseudonyms about shared experiences. Some of the most popular forums include “life as a laborer,” “all about job seeking,” and “family of restaurant workers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s really a place where [users] discuss things quite freely and find a sense of community online,” Yao explained to a May 2019 earnings call to analysts, translated from Mandarin to English by 58 Tongcheng’s Chief Financial Officer, Hao Zhou. Complaints are common. “Sometimes they are under pressure,” Yao explained. “They don’t have an outlet for some of the steam or just a place to find people [who] have similar feedback or a place to find comfort.” The company did not respond to <em>Rest of World</em>’s interview request.</p>

<p>That’s exactly what’s happening now in the aftermath of the first wave of the pandemic. After losing her job, Jiang used the 58 Tongcheng app because she heard from others that it was a helpful recruitment platform. After several frustrating days of job hunting, she needed to vent her negative energy. Overnight, more than 100 people commented on her post, sharing their own experiences of being laid off or scammed by training programs.</p>



<p>Jiang found comfort in what she read. “I was having so much anxiety, but then I saw that everyone is in the same situation,” she told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>Every day, hundreds of people, like Jiang, now use the 58 Tongcheng app to share their experiences of unemployment. Not every post receives equal attention. Some are marked as quality content and placed on the front page. Others are quickly ignored. Four days after her post, Jiang wrote another one, asking for job or apprenticeship leads. It was viewed only 70 times; no one replied.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Few conversations have trickled out of the app into the public conversation. But last month, a Chinese photographer who goes by the alias Fennu Yinhang (<a href="https://weibo.com/5625216939/J566W4nWg?type=comment#_rnd1594845115454">@愤怒银行</a>) posted screenshots on Weibo and called them “Unemployment Notes on 58 Tongcheng.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Fennu Yinhang, the screenshots contained some of the app’s most popular posts. In one, a woman describes spending $10 on cosmetics and picking out her best outfit to interview for salesperson positions. “I don’t care what I will be selling,” she writes, “as long as it’s a sales job.” Another complained that, being 45, she was excluded from all the jobs requiring applicants to be between 18 and 42. (Age discrimination is legal in China.) But her son had reassured her on the phone: “Mom, you are great. They failed to see your value.”</p>



<p>This post quickly went viral, in part because so few users on Weibo — who are typically white-collar — seem to realize how bad the unemployment situation for blue-collar workers is. In comments on the post, many were coming to terms with the extent of China’s unemployment crisis. “We need to be able to talk about poems, about the trending topic BLM, about aesthetics, photography, fashion, coffee bean types, and whiskey producers,” one of the top comments reads, “but we also need to see the pain and dilemma of people around us.”</p>



<p>Still, discussions of the severity of mass unemployment remain scarce on social media — and among Chinese leaders.</p>



<p>Since the pandemic first broke out in December, the Chinese government has taken small steps toward helping workers. This month, it organized its first-ever <a href="http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2020-07/02/content_5523428.htm">civilian-run Company Recruitment Month</a><strong> </strong>to match unemployed workers with jobs in the private sector. 58 Tongcheng pitched in, hosting a <a href="https://hrgactivity.58.com/render/minyingqiyezhaopinyue/home">virtual hiring expo</a> for the service industry, along with other platforms. But government policies, as they exist now, have many flaws. The vast majority of jobless workers — about 90% — are not eligible for unemployment benefits, resulting in a mass underestimation of the unemployment numbers. Xi Jinping made poverty eradication by 2020 one of his goals; now it looks like <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/impact-covid-19-coronavirus-global-poverty-why-sub-saharan-africa-might-be-region-hardest">the numbers will only increase</a>.</p>



<p>In the absence of an open conversation about the effects of the economic downturn, 58 Tongcheng users have turned the app into a channel to express and document their frustration. Away from the media spotlight, this corner of the internet may find its greatest value in illustrating the true depth of pandemic despair.</p>

In this guide, I take this concept further by helping you create a workflow where every corner of your screen has a purpose, and apps can be launched and rearranged quickly with keystrokes. All with a dose of beautiful <em>a e s t h e t i c s</em>.</p><p>If you don’t have a <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-mac-window-management-tools/">window management app</a> yet, that’s a good place to start. I will be focusing the guide on <a href="https://manytricks.com/moom/">Moom</a> but the specific tool doesn’t really matter as long as it supports these killer features:</p><h3 id="grids">Grids</h3><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-22.png" alt=""></figure><p>Your chosen app should allow you define areas on your screen based on a grid that you can customize to your liking. In my case, I divide my screen in an 8x8 grid for fine-control.</p><h3 id="keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard shortcuts</h3><p>Many solutions out there have menus that you can click in order to rearrange windows. This can be convenient at times, but if you’re dealing with large displays, using your mouse for this is going to be time consuming. </p><h3 id="gaps-between-windows">Gaps between windows</h3><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-23.png" alt=""></figure><p>When running commands to divide or rearrange your windows, you’ll want your window management app to leave some space or gap between them. While it make seem like a subjective aesthetic choice, it will give you some breathing room and better sense of space. Plus it looks good.</p><h2 id="creating-a-default-layout">Creating a default layout</h2><p>A default layout is how your windows will be arranged most of the time. You may move them around for certain tasks, but having a layout to <em>default</em> to will keep your workflow consistent. Before we jump to specifics, let’s first answer this question:</p><blockquote>What apps do you use the most and what are they used for?</blockquote><p>Make sure you group them by category. Order doesn’t matter. This is <em>my</em> answer:</p><ul><li>Internet browsing: Google Chrome</li><li>Main work tool: <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">kitty</a>, a Terminal.app alternative</li><li>Communications: Slack, WhatsApp, Messages</li><li>File management: Finder.app</li></ul><h3 id="designing-the-layout">Designing the layout</h3><p>This will depend entirely on your personal preference and hardware situation, but what you generally want to do is grab the apps from above and arrange them in such a way that it matches the time you spend on them and the space they actually need. </p><p>Another advice is to keep apps in the same category (such as Slack, Messages and WhatsApp) stacked since you can switch between them easily.</p><p>Here’s my layout:</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/zones.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/zones.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/zones.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/zones.png 1600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/zones.png 1878w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>I used a 8x8 grid to help create the right proportion. E.g. I needed my browser to be a bit wider than half the screen.</figcaption></figure><p>I have two monitors that are the exact same size. I find that my eyes default more to the right monitor so having my work tool (3) occupy the entire screen there is more ergonomic to me. I need my browser (2) conveniently close for reference or previewing changes, but also general browsing so occupying the majority of the left screen feels right also. </p><p>Communications apps (1) are stacked up on the same quadrant on the top left of my setup and I switch to them based on need. That leaves a convenient location for file management (4) on the bottom left.</p><p>This is a screenshot of how it actually looks:</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-1.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-1.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-1.png 1600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-1.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Click to zoom.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="supercharge-with-hotkeys">Supercharge with hotkeys</h3><p>Once you’re satisfied with the layout, it’s time to make it easy to re-create with your window management tool. Moom will let you select a part of your screen and set a keyboard shortcut:</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-17.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-17.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-17.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-17.png 1020w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>On the top right out of each of these custom settings, I can set a key to use in combination with Moom’s hotkey, which is <code>Control + ↑</code> in my case. I chose <code>1</code> because its the first area from left to right. So, if I want to move Slack or any other communication tool like (Messages) to area <code>1</code>, I press <code>Control + ↑ + 1</code>. </p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/keyboard_shortcuts-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/keyboard_shortcuts-2.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/keyboard_shortcuts-2.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/keyboard_shortcuts-2.png 1600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/keyboard_shortcuts-2.png 1878w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>For area 3, I use <code>Control + ↑ + Space</code>. This is a default hotkey from Moom to occupy the entire screen.</figcaption></figure><p>Moom also has a custom setting that saves your window/app arrangement and lets you set up a key for it using the <em>Arrange Windows</em> custom setting:</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-18.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-18.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-18.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-18.png 1018w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>"Ignore obstructed windows" is checked by default, but I kept it on because I want other communication tools to be moved as well (even if they’re not visible)</figcaption></figure><p>In this case, if I want to quickly re-create my entire default layout, all I have to do is press <code>Control + ↑ + D</code>. If something looks off, you can move your windows again (or close apps you don’t want to be affected by this layout) and then click on <em>Update Snapshot </em>to save your changes.</p><h2 id="everyday-layouts">Everyday layouts</h2><p>Depending on your workflow, you may need to move windows quickly in addition to your default layout. </p><h3 id="side-by-side-layout">Side by side layout</h3><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-13.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-13.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-13.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-13.png 1600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-13.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Useful when you want to cross reference information or previewing. You probably already use it to some capacity, but here are some hotkeys I use that make that process easier:</p><ul><li>Move a window to the left half of the screen: <code>Control + ↑ + ←</code></li><li>Move a window to the right half of the screen: <code>Control + ↑ + →</code></li></ul><p>A setting like Moom’s <em>Arrange Windows</em> also comes handy for this, all you have to do is put the two type of windows you want side by side and set it up:</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-20.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-20.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-20.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-20.png 1016w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>In this case, I do want to <em>Ignore obstructed windows</em> because I only care about the windows visible.</figcaption></figure><p>So the keyboard shortcut for this ends up being <code>Control + ↑ + S</code>. If you use a setting like this, you may need to do it per app/window combination.</p><h3 id="zen-layout">Zen layout</h3><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-14.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-14.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-14.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-14.png 1600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-14.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Even with so much productivity and multi-tasking gains from your default layout, sometimes you just want to focus on one thing at a time. Now, you could take an app fullscreen, but dealing with a big display the contents of that window can look weird or unappealing. </p><p>What I call a <em>zen layout</em> is really just a combination of two things:</p><ol><li>A hotkey to center a window and give it just the right width so the content inside of it doesn’t look weird.</li><li>Hide everything else with the Mac’s standard shortcut &nbsp;<code>Option + ⌘ + H</code></li></ol><p>In Moom, a setting for my zen layout looks like this:</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-21.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-21.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-21.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-21.png 1018w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>So now I can trigger this configuration with <code>Control + ↑ + ↵ Enter</code>.</p><h2 id="launch-or-switching-apps-with-hotkeys">Launch or switching apps with hotkeys</h2><p>Using <code>⌘ + Tab</code> should not be your main way to move between apps.

Hopefully these tips make your life a bit easier. A partying piece of advice is to always experiment with new layouts and configurations until you find one that works for you. I used to prefer working on my smaller laptop screen until I took the time to explore my options with larger displays and multiple monitors. Only then did I realize how much more productive I could me.</p></section></div></article></div></div>]]>

Your host is Tobias Macey, and today I'm interviewing Kyle Kingsbury about his work on the Jepson testing framework and the failure modes of distributed systems. So Kyle, can you start by introducing yourself?</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:24">0:02:24</a></span></p><p>Oh, my name is Kyle Kingsbury. I work on Jepsen, which is a project to test distributed systems.</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:29">0:02:29</a></span></p><p>And do you remember how you first got involved in the area of data management</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:32">0:02:32</a></span></p><p>out of college? I couldn't get into grad school actually happened during the financial crash in 2009. And I was working up a startup in San Francisco and doing distributed database work</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:42">0:02:42</a></span></p><p>there one thing led to another and so can you dig a bit more into what the Jepsen project is and some of the backstory of how you came to create it and your original inspiration or motivation for digging into this particular area?</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:56">0:02:56</a></span></p><p>Yeah, so Jepson is a project to helped make distributed systems safer by testing them and seeing what they do under real world failure modes. And back around 2010, its distributed systems were becoming popular industry. But a lot of folks had sort of optimistic expectations. But what was possible, and there were some claims flying around that seemed a little bit irresponsible. There was a good deal of argument over this back and forth on Twitter and blogs, mailing lists. I was active on the React mailing list for quite some time. And eventually, I started Jepson to demonstrate that these problems were actually things that could happen in the real world. They were just theoretical issues.</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:03:39">0:03:39</a></span></p><p>Yeah, I know that particularly when you are just testing and building a system. It's easy to see Oh, everything works great. And kind of push off the fact that there are going to be network faults and there are going to be clock skews and clock drifts that causes things to not operate the way that you want them to. And I'm curious what you have seen As far as some of the common misconceptions or misunderstandings of people who are both building and using distributed systems and the types of guarantees that they provide,</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:04:10">0:04:10</a></span></p><p>yeah, that couldn't be started. There were all sorts of interesting expectations. I remember MongoDB, for example, wrote something about how users shouldn't expect to preserve data when a process crashes or is killed with kill dash nine. And as a result, I think, sort of throwing some sort of cocktail party called kill dash nine. Meanwhile, React was busy falling over anytime you tried to list keys in the database. So there was there's a lot of rough and tumble action in those days. Nowadays. I think people take partitions crashes, that sort of thing more seriously. I see a lot of folks at least tried to do some degree of testing for those. And yet, when I do consulting work, often I'll find databases where it looks like nobody tried to verify behavior during faults.</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:04:56">0:04:56</a></span></p><p>And aside from Jepson, what are some of the other matters methods that people typically use for stress testing or evaluating the guarantees of these systems</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:05:06">0:05:06</a></span></p><p>and look at Jepsen, because it's an experimental approach as being one part of a complete breakfast continuum of quality methods. One of those is to start with a proven algorithm, some sort of abstract model of your system and either to have a hand or machine check proof of it, or at least a model checker, maybe with TLA. And if you are lucky, you can do some sort of code extraction with caulk or high level or cipher f HL with Isabel. But that's, that's not I think how most production systems get built. Most systems get built by pointing at a whiteboard and writing a bunch of code. And then your tools for Safety Analysis tend to be more along the lines of unit tests and integration tests. Jepsen takes a blackbox approach, which puts it sort of at the far end of integration testing other systems like Cassandra's D test suite Take a similar approach. You'll see people who do sort of manual testing where they do fault injection via somebody just running commands on the cluster or toggling some sort of hardware power switch, or network switch. That's the approach that's taken by foundation DB foundation. Devi also does a lot of automated simulation testing, where they will run a virtualized network with many simulated nodes in the same process and they can intercept messages and reorder them to get interesting results. So I think there's there's a lot of approaches people take to testing systems Jepson tries to general and who to work across many types of systems, which often means that it's not as deep or as capable as exploring the state space as a say a simulation test that's written specifically for the database that you're working on might be,</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:06:46">0:06:46</a></span></p><p>and then as far as some of the real world usage of things like databases and other mission critical distributed systems, what are some of the real world impacts that can occur as a result of these failures that aren't properly vetted or properly guarded against,</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:07:05">0:07:05</a></span></p><p>oh, you can get all kinds of faults, obviously, data could be lost. So you, you write something and then it just disappears later, you can have different nodes that compete on some version of the history. So maybe one person thinks that the list you're adding things to is 123, and other things, it's four or five, six, you can have temporal anomalies where you read some information from the past, instead of the present. You could have transactional violations where two transactions kind of land on top of each other or interleave, in some weird way. And all these systems that I've tested exhibit,</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:07:40">0:07:40</a></span></p><p>typically one or more of these behaviors. The question is sort of how hard you have to push them to get there. And then in terms of the actual testing approach of using Jepsen for being able to find some of these error modes that exist in a particular system. What is your overall approach for business? Finding the test suite and customizing it for a given system. Because all of these different platforms will have different guarantees that they're trying to provide, or different approaches to linearize ability or serializability, or the strictness of the isolation that they provide. And I know that that provides a fairly extensive surface area to try and cover in any test suite. And I'm wondering just what your approaches for determining what are the key points to interact with. And then also any variability in the actual interfaces that are exposed by these systems for being able to interact with them and validate the correctness of the operations that are being performed?</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:08:38">0:08:38</a></span></p><p>Yeah, you're quite right. There's there's sort of two huge surface areas to cover. One of them is the breadth of the API, all the different things databases do. Modern SQL databases have so many functions and so many interacting components that it's really difficult to predict, you know, how they're going to interact. And it also is tricky because when you get awkward misers into the mix. You know, depending on something like the size of your data, you might have two very different code paths that can evolve with different safety properties. So I don't have a good answer for that, you know, I write as many tests as I can in the time that I have. But that's usually just a tiny fraction of the overall API. My guiding principle is to …</p></div></div></div></div>

July 29, 2020 | https://microtica.com/deploy-your-first-microservice-on-kubernetes-in-10-mins/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://microtica.com/deploy-your-first-microservice-on-kubernetes-in-10-mins/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>Kubernetes is the most popular open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. Kubernetes abstracts the underlying infrastructure layer. As a result, developers can focus on building applications, then deploy them to any of those environments.</p>



<p>To bring Kubernetes closer to developers, we’ve created a ready-to-use <a href="https://github.com/microtica-components/component-aws-eks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infrastructure component for Kubernetes</a>. This component uses AWS EKS as a service and sets Kubernetes master and nodes in auto-scaling infrastructure setup. Nodes are EC2 instances based on Kubernetes optimized AMIs.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Components are a core concept in Microtica which allow developers to create and release their custom Cloud infrastructure setup in a standardized way. A</em>fter <em>the component is created, it can be reused in as many projects and environments as needed.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>In addition to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://microtica.com/start-creating-infrastructure-on-aws-like-a-pro/" target="_blank">infrastructure setup</a> for Kubernetes, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.microtica.com/" target="_blank">Microtica</a> also offers you CI and CD for microservices. This means that you don’t have to worry about the complex details of the integration with Kubernetes. With this, we cover the whole process of software and infrastructure delivery.</p>



<p>In this article, we will learn how to <strong>deploy a microservice in the cloud with our Kubernetes component</strong>. Let’s get started by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.microtica.com/register" target="_blank">creating your account</a> and project in Microtica. To deploy your first microservice in under 10 mins, follow these steps:</p>



<h3><strong>1. Add your AWS Account</strong></h3>



<p>First, go into <em>Settings</em>, then <em>AWS Accounts </em>tab, then <em>Add New Account</em>. Follow the steps to connect your account.</p>



<p><em>Note: All resources will be created on the provided AWS account, expenses will be calculated according to AWS pricing for using the services.</em></p>



<h3><strong>2. Create an environment</strong></h3>



<p>With a connected AWS account, you can continue to create your environment in which you’ll deploy your infrastructure. <a href="https://portal.microtica.com/environments/create" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Create an environment</a> following the wizard on Microtica and then continue to add the components we will need.</p>



<h3><strong>3. Add components</strong></h3>



<p>To successfully setup a working Kubernetes Cluster in which we’ll deploy a microservice, we will need only 2 components: a <strong>VPC component </strong>and of course a <strong>Kubernetes Cluster component</strong>. We need the VPC (Amazon Virtual Private Cloud) component to enable us to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that we’ve defined. This virtual network is dedicated to your AWS account. This component sets one AWS VPC, and four subnets (2 public and 2 private subnets).</p>



<p>Here’s how to configure your components to connect them and create the infrastructure.</p>

<p>When configuring the parameters for the Kubernetes Cluster component you can reference the VPC component so you <strong>don’t have to manually reenter the values</strong>. Microtica will take care of the order in which the components will be deployed in the cloud. This will allow you to have a working environment.</p>

<p>With the configuration set in place, you can deploy your environment by clicking <em>Create Plan</em>. Here you will see a detailed listing of the resources that are about to be added to the environment. Confirming will initiate the deployment and lead you to a page where you can follow the logs and events that are happening. Setting up this infrastructure can take up to 15 mins, so let us get started with our microservice in the meantime.</p>



<h3><strong>4. Create a microservice</strong></h3>



<p>For the purposes of this example, we will be using a simple <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world" target="_blank">Hello World microservice</a> available in Docker hub. First, go to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.microtica.com/microservices/create" target="_blank"><em>Microservices/Create microservice</em></a><em> </em>and follow the wizard in Microtica. For a source select public docker image and paste <strong>hello-world</strong>. Then, click <em>Next</em>, then <em>Create Microservice </em>and now we have our microservice.</p>

<p>As a result of using a docker image as a source, we already have a built artifact so we can immediately deploy it in the Kubernetes cluster. <strong>You can do this from <em>Microservice details — Add to Cluster</em>, or in the<em> Kubernetes Dashboard — Microservices — Deploy.</em></strong></p>

<p>Microtica offers configuration options when deploying your microservice in a Kubernetes Cluster.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can select the scaling options, and as well setup continuous delivery for your microservice.</p>



<p>After successfully deploying the microservice in the Kubernetes Cluster you can preview your microservice by following the <strong><em>Access URL/hello-world-ms</em></strong><em> </em>(the name of the service if you’ve changed it). You should see this in your browser window:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0KLYx9DQIHY9wBiN8.png" alt="Your first microservice on a Kubernetes cluster
"></figure></div>



<p><strong>AND WE ARE DONE! WE JUST DEPLOYED OUR FIRST MICROSERVICE ON A KUBERNETES CLUSTER 👏</strong></p>



<h3><strong>5. Bonus: Cleanup</strong></h3>



<p>To remove all the resources we created on your AWS account go to environment details and in the menu select <em>Undeploy. </em>As a result, you’ll get your resources created on AWS cleaned. However, you will still have the configuration in Microtica in case you want to deploy it in the cloud again.</p>

July 29, 2020 | https://bojanvidanovic.com/posts/moving-away-from-pocket-to-my-hugo-website-and-firefox-bookmarks/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bojanvidanovic.com/posts/moving-away-from-pocket-to-my-hugo-website-and-firefox-bookmarks/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I’ve been using <a href="https://getpocket.com/" title="Pocket">Pocket</a> for the last few years, actually moved from <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/" title="Instapaper">Instapaper</a> after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17387146/instapaper-gdpr-europe-access-shut-down-privacy-changes" title="GDPR incident">GDPR incident</a>, and I’ve been happy ever since. But I decided to move all of my public links to my static website. The reason for this has nothing to do with the company, I think they offer a great service for free. It is just I never liked that another company owns my data, especially in this case when a service is easily replaceable by a simple note-taking app.</p>
<p>So how am I going to replace Pocket? Well, all my favorite links will be exported from Pocket to a <a href="https://bojanvidanovic.com/bookmarks" title="dedicated page">dedicated page</a> on my website and will be publicly available, as on the <a href="https://getpocket.com/@bojanvidanovic" title="Pocket profile">Pocket profile</a> page. Then I’ll manage all my future links through Git or <a href="https://forestry.io/" title="CMS">CMS</a>. While the read-it-later type of links will be bookmarked in <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/bookmarks-firefox" title="Firefox">Firefox</a> and synced across all my devices, which I’ve been already using for a while and find it much easier to use.</p>
<h3 id="exporting-data-from-pocket">Exporting data from Pocket</h3>
<p>Requesting your data from Pocket is a one-click operation, the problem is that they don’t give you any options on what file type you want. All your data is by default exported in an HTML file with a bunch of list items.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">    &lt;<span>ul</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span>li</span>&gt;&lt;<span>a</span> <span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"https://jmperezperez.com/assess-performance-impact/"</span> <span>time_added</span><span>=</span><span>"1595837017"</span> <span>tags</span><span>=</span><span>""</span>&gt;How to Estimate Web Performance Impact Before Making Fixes - José M. Pérez&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;&lt;/<span>li</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span>li</span>&gt;&lt;<span>a</span> <span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"https://increment.com/frontend/ask-an-expert-why-is-css-the-way-it-is/"</span> <span>time_added</span><span>=</span><span>"1595518932"</span> <span>tags</span><span>=</span><span>""</span>&gt;Ask an expert: Why is CSS . . . the way it is? – Increment: Frontend&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;&lt;/<span>li</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span>li</span>&gt;&lt;<span>a</span> <span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"https://alexnixon.github.io/2019/12/10/writing.html"</span> <span>time_added</span><span>=</span><span>"1595403017"</span> <span>tags</span><span>=</span><span>""</span>&gt;It&amp;#039;s time to start writing&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;&lt;/<span>li</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span>li</span>&gt;&lt;<span>a</span> <span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"https://tim.blog/podcast/"</span> <span>time_added</span><span>=</span><span>"1594717067"</span> <span>tags</span><span>=</span><span>""</span>&gt;Podcast — The Tim Ferriss Show – The Blog of Author Tim Ferriss&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;&lt;/<span>li</span>&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/<span>ul</span>&gt;</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="converting-to-json">Converting to JSON</h3>
<p>So, I slightly modified the exported HTML file to use dataset attributes for tags like time_added and tags, copied it to <a href="https://codepen.io/" title="Codepen">Codepen</a> and ran this code to get the list in JSON format:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript">    <span>var</span> <span>list</span> <span>=</span> [];
    
    <span>$</span>(<span>'ul a'</span>).<span>each</span>(<span>function</span>(<span>idx</span>, <span>item</span>){
        <span>list</span>.<span>push</span>({
            <span>href</span><span>:</span> <span>$</span>(<span>item</span>).<span>attr</span>(<span>'href'</span>),
            <span>title</span><span>:</span> <span>item</span>.<span>textContent</span>,
            <span>date</span><span>:</span> <span>item</span>.<span>dataset</span>.<span>date</span>,
            <span>tags</span><span>:</span> <span>item</span>.<span>dataset</span>.<span>tags</span>
        });
    });
    
    <span>JSON</span>.<span>stringify</span>(<span>list</span>, <span>null</span>, <span>"  "</span>);
</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="importing-to-static-website">Importing to static website</h3>
<p>After obtaining the list in JSON format, I needed to create a Markdown file for every entry in the JSON file. This is where the Python magic comes in:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">    <span>import</span> json
    
    f <span>=</span> open(<span>'export.json'</span>)
    data <span>=</span> json<span>.</span>load(f)
    
    <span>for</span> link <span>in</span> data:
        filename <span>=</span> link[<span>"text"</span>]<span>.</span>lower()<span>.</span>replace(<span>" "</span>, <span>"-"</span>)<span>.</span>replace(<span>"?"</span>,  <span>""</span>)<span>.</span>replace(<span>"/"</span>, <span>"-"</span>)
        <span>with</span> open(filename <span>+</span> <span>".md"</span>, <span>"w"</span>) <span>as</span> md_file:
            md_file<span>.</span>write(<span>'---</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>)
            md_file<span>.</span>write(<span>'title: "'</span> <span>+</span> link[<span>"text"</span>]<span>.</span>encode(<span>'utf-8'</span>) <span>+</span> <span>'"</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>)
            md_file<span>.</span>write(<span>'date: '</span> <span>+</span> link[<span>"date"</span>] <span>+</span> <span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>)
            md_file<span>.</span>write(<span>'linkUrl: '</span> <span>+</span> link[<span>"href"</span>] <span>+</span> <span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>)
            md_file<span>.</span>write(<span>'---'</span>)
            md_file<span>.</span>close()
    
    f<span>.</span>close()</code></pre></div>
<p>This simple script created a Markdown file for Hugo for every link from the list.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>As you can see, with a few simple scripts I have back my data and transferred to my <a href="https://gohugo.io/" title="Hugo">Hugo</a> website. And replaced the core Pocket functionality with Firefox bookmarks.</p>

But it’s the hardware that’s letting it down. The Pixel 2 was a developer device, and as such it was easy to boot from the USB and whatnot.</p><p>But before this post becomes a Chromebook-off: it’s not. It’s more that my new device’s developer failings got me searching the internet for something new to play with, and I came across this: <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://pine64.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PINE64</a>.</p><h2>Open source hardware</h2><p>Simply put, it’s an open source hardware/software combination of various flavours of Linux, SBCs (single board computers) and other smaller bits of hardware (eg, cameras).</p><figure><img src="https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PINEA64-SBC.jpg" alt="PINEA64+ Single Board Computer" srcset="https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PINEA64-SBC.jpg 600w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PINEA64-SBC-300x178.jpg 300w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PINEA64-SBC-370x219.jpg 370w, https://www.20i.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PINEA64-SBC-270x160.jpg 270w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption>The PINEA64+’s Single Board</figcaption></figure><p>They can be assembled together for whatever purpose you have – much like the Raspberry Pi.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The goal of this post is to review well-adopted ideas that have stood the test of time. I will present a small set of techniques that cover a lot of basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research. If you're new to the field, these are a great starting point.</p><div id="post-content"><p>Deep Learning is an extremely fast-moving field and the huge number of research papers and ideas can be overwhelming. Even seasoned researchers have a hard time telling company PR from real breakthroughs. The goal of this post is to review those ideas that have <strong>stood the test of time</strong>, which is perhaps the only significance test one should rely on. These ideas, or improvements of them, have been used over and over again. They're known to work.</p> <p>If you were to start in Deep Learning today, understanding and implementing each of these techniques would give you an excellent foundation for understanding recent research and working on your own projects. It's what I believe the best way to get started. Working through papers in historical order is also a useful exercise to understand where the current techniques come from and why they were invented in the first place. <strong><strong>Put another way, I will try to present a <em>minimal set</em> of ideas that most of the basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research.</strong></strong></p> <p>A rather unique thing about Deep Learning is that its application domains (Vision, Natural Language, Speech, RL, etc) share the majority of techniques. For example, someone who has worked in Deep Learning for Computer Vision his whole career could quickly be productive in NLP research. The specific network architectures may differ, but the concepts, approaches and code are mostly the same. I will try to present ideas from various fields, but there are a few caveats about this list:</p> <ul> <li>My goal is not to give in-depth explanations or code examples for these techniques. It's not easily possible to summarize long complex papers into a single paragraph. Instead, I will give a brief overview of each technique, its historical context, and links to papers and implementations. If you want to learn something, I <em>highly recommend</em> trying to re-produce some of these paper results from scratch in raw <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> without using existing code bases or high-level libraries.</li> <li>The list is biased towards my own knowledge and the fields I am familiar with. There are many exciting subfields that I don't have experience with. I will stick to what most people would consider the popular mainstream domains of Vision, Natural Language, Speech, and Reinforcement Learning / Games.</li> <li>I will only discuss research that has official or semi-official open source implementations that are known to work well. Some research isn't easily reproducible because it involves huge engineering challenges, for example <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">DeepMind's AlphaGo</a> or <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">OpenAI's Dota 2 AI</a>, so I won't highlight it here.</li> <li>Some choices are arbitrary. Often, rather similar techniques are published at around the same time. The goal of this post is not be a comprehensive review, but to to expose someone new to the field to a cross-section of ideas that cover a lot of ground. For example, there may be hundreds of GAN variations, but to understand the general concept of GANs, it really doesn't matter which one you study.</li> </ul>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks">ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (2012)</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_imagenet_2012">Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton (2012)</span></li> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0580">Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature detectors (2012)</a> <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al.

It is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network based on the earlier LeNet developed by Yann LeCun. AlexNet beat previous methods at classifying images from the <a href="http://image-net.org/index">ImageNet dataset</a> by a significant margin through a combination of GPU power and algorithmic advances. It demonstrated that neural networks actually work! AlexNet was also one of the first times Dropout <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al. (2012)</span> was used, which has since become a crucial component for improving the generalization ability of all kinds of Deep Learning models.</p> <p>The architecture used by AlexNet, a sequence of Convolutional layers, ReLU nonlinearity, and max-pooling, became the accepted standard that future Computer Vision architectures would extend and built upon. These days, software libraries such as PyTorch are so powerful, and compared to more recent architectures AlexNet is so simple, that it can be implemented in only a few lines of code. Note that many implementations of AlexNet, such as those linked above, use the slight variation of the network described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5997">One weird trick for parallelizing convolutional neural networks</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_one_2014">Krizhevsky (2014)</span>.</p>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602">Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning (2013)</a> <span data-cites="mnih_playing_2013">Mnih et al.

What's more, the <em>same</em> neural network architecture learned to play seven different games without being told any game-specific rules, demonstrating the generality of the approach.</p> <p>Reinforcement Learning differs from Supervised Learning, such as image classification, in that an agent must learn maximize to the sum of rewards over multiple time steps, such as winning a game, instead of just predicting a label. Because the agent interacts directly with the environment and each action affects the next, the training data is not independent and identically distributed (iid), which makes the training of many Machine Learning models quite unstable. This was solved by using techniques such as experience replay <span data-cites="lin_self-improving_1992">Lin (1992)</span>.</p> <p>While there was no obvious algorithmic innovation that made this work, the research cleverly combined existing techniques, convolutional neural networks trained on GPUs and experience replay, with a few data processing tricks to achieve impressive results that most people would not have expected. This gave people confidence in extending Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques to tackle even more complex tasks such as <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">Go</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">Dota 2</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii">Starcraft 2</a>, and others.</p> <p>Atari Games <span data-cites="bellemare_arcade_2013">Bellemare et al. (2013)</span> have since become a standard benchmark in Reinforcement Learning research. The initial approach only solved (beat human baselines on) seven games, but over the coming years advances built on top of these ideas would start beating humans on an ever increasing number of games. One particular game, Montezuma’s Revenge, was famous for requiring long-term planning and was considered to be among the most difficult to solve. It was only recently <span data-cites="badia_agent57_2020">Badia et al. (2020)</span> <span data-cites="ecoffet_first_2020">Ecoffet et al.

While the NLP community had success with <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">Language Modeling</a> and Translation using LSTM networks <span data-cites="hochreiter_long_1997">Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997)</span> and Encoder-Decoder architectures <span data-cites="sutskever_sequence_2014">Sutskever, Vinyals, and Le (2014)</span>, it was not until the invention of the <strong>attention</strong> mechanism <span data-cites="bahdanau_neural_2016">Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio (2016)</span> that things started to work spectacularly well.</p> <p>When processing language, each token, which could be a character, a word, or something in between, is fed into a recurrent network, such as an LSTM, which maintains a kind of memory of previously processed inputs. In other words, a sentence is very similar to a time series with each token being a time step. These recurrent models often had difficulty dealing with dependencies over long time horizons. When they process a sequence, they would easily "forget" earlier inputs because their gradients needed to propagate through many time steps. Optimizing these models with gradient descent was hard.</p> <p>The new attention mechanism helped alleviate the problem. It gave the network an option to adaptively "look back" at earlier time steps by introducing shortcut connections. These connections allowed the network to decide which inputs are important when producing a specific output. The canonical example is translation: When producing an output word, it typically maps to one or more specific input words.</p>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980">Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization</a> <span data-cites="kingma_adam_2017">Kingma and Ba (2017)</span></li> </ul> <p><strong><strong>Implementations</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://d2l.ai/chapter_optimization/adam.html">Implementing Adam in Python</a></li> <li><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/master/_modules/torch/optim/adam.html">PyTorch Adam implementation</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/v2.2.0/tensorflow/python/keras/optimizer_v2/adam.py#L32-L281">TensorFlow Adam implementation</a></li> </ul> <figure> <img src="https://dennybritz.com/assets/deep-learning-most-important-ideas/optimizer-benchmark.png" alt=""><figcaption>Source: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11758">http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11758</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Neural networks are trained by minimizing a loss function, such as the average classification error, using an optimizer. The optimizer is responsible for figuring out how to adjust the parameters of the network to make it learn the objective. Most optimizers are <a href="https://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/">based on variations of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)</a>. However, many of these optimizers contain tunable parameters such as a learning rate themselves. Finding the right settings for a specific problem not only reduces training time, but can also lead to better results due to finding a better local minimum of the loss function.</p> <p>Big resarch labs often ran expensive hyperparameter searches that came up with complex learning rate schedules to get the best out of simple but hyperparameter-sensitive optimizers such as SGD.

We know the knowns and our existing SRE toolchain does a very good job of validating them. In that sense, existing metrics are our tells and our tools are like Clever Hans, which happily tap away to verify what we know. What existing tools or limited metrics don’t tell us are hidden anomalies that manifest as faint glimmers in incidents when we are in fire fighting mode.</p><p>A single node failure of a standalone 3 node load balancer app has vastly different implications than a single node failure in a system where the faulty node has both upstream and downstream dependencies. Similarly, if you did not have distributed tracing, how would you map a request journey in a microservices based system? Systems evolved, problems evolved and hence tooling evolved. In the absence of tooling that evolves with problems, we are fooling ourselves to believe that our alarms cover the whole outage domain, akin to saying that Clever Hans knows math.</p><p>Making Clever Hans do math is impossible, but choosing tools that solve todayâ€™s problems and anticipate near future needs is tractable. Staying in lockstep with the problem domain of system as it evolves is key. Detecting where your existing tooling falls short and filling those gaps is a learnable skill. During that process, you will realize that marrying your existing toolchain or shoehorning problems to fit a familiar tool is counter productive.</p><p>So do you adopt every shiny new tool that shows up on hackernews? No. Exploring a tool to do a test run is one thing, ensuring enterprise adoption across teams is another. Weigh the benefits against the switching cost. Is it worth switching if the system you are solving problems for is sunsetting in the next 3 months? Conversely, isnâ€™t it worth evaluating a CI/CD tool if your team is spending most of their time doing manual deployments? These are real questions that go beyond the shimmer of superficial concerns like – <em>Is it written in my favourite programming language? Is it the next best thing I could put on my resume?</em></p><h3><span id="Takeaways"></span>Takeaways<span></span></h3><ul><li>Know your Clever Hans toolchain. Put on your poker face and ask hard subjective questions.</li><li>Bend the solutions to your problem, not new problems to old solutions.</li><li>Own your toolchain and not the other way around.</li><li>If the only tool you know is a hammer, everything will look like a nail. Identify those hammers. Be on the lookout for power drills.</li></ul><p><em>Update</em>: We had some really interesting discussions with the SRE community on reddit around this post.

<p>Galaksija was to be in Yugoslavia what Commodore and Sinclair were in the west. Whether it succeeded or not, its deceptively simple design can still teach us a lot of interesting tricks on how to make a usable computer and operating system with as few transistors and bits as possible.

<p>“The two pizza team” paradigm has become really popular in the context of organizing software teams. The idea is to have small, self-reliant teams working independently to solve problems. The “two-pizza” refers to the guidance to keep the team small enough that we need not order more than two pizzas to feed them.</p>
<figure><img src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-1024x701.jpg" data-src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-1024x701.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-1024x701.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-300x205.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-768x526.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-1070x732.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size.jpg 1505w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-1024x701.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-300x205.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-768x526.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-1070x732.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size.jpg 1505w"></figure>
<p>These teams are all around us today, but we are not seeing the kind of productivity or shipping velocity that we expected to see. Most developers, especially in larger organizations, complain about meetings, the burden of communication, the slow pace of change etc. Startups often sell themselves to potential candidates by touting their agility. But why should larger companies be slow if everyone is using the same “empowered team”/”autonomous team” model for organizing themselves?</p>
<p>I argue that <strong>we have lost the original intent of the “two pizza teams”</strong> (aka autonomous teams). The way we are organizing and scaling teams as companies grow larger is exactly opposite to the spirit of the idea, and this is making the already difficult problem of keeping teams motivated and agile even more difficult.</p>
<h3><strong>Why two pizza teams</strong></h3>
<p>The concept of the “two pizza”/”autonomous” team arose from attempts to minimize communication between multiple teams and empowering a single team to be in complete control of delivering customer value.</p>
<p>Before this idea gained popularity, the most common way of organizing teams was in terms of Backend, UI, DBA, Ops etc.. Building any feature required a lot of communication, collaboration, and alignment between all these groups.</p>
<p>The notion of a small team which had all the skills required to solve a single specific problem was intended to solve this problem. A single team would be given the entirety of the problem statement and the tools it needed to solve it. This would ideally remove the problem of aligning multiple teams around shared roadmaps and delivery schedules and allow the team to own the problem solving process end-to-end.</p>
<p>There are two core concepts underlying the two-pizza team – <strong>mission</strong> and<strong> independence</strong>. Ideally, end-to-end means all the way to the customer or the business. Hence, <strong>every autonomous team is expected to generate direct business value all by itself</strong>, without a lot of overlap with other teams. Additionally, <strong>the team should be able to meets its goals independently</strong> (i.e. without reliance on or interference from other teams) This reduces the cross team communication overhead because its members have all the skills needed to solve the problem.</p>
<h3>What went wrong</h3>
<p>Somewhere along the line, we forgot about “reducing communication” just started fixating on assigning independent teams to problem statements that were essentially tiny slices of business problems. As the problem space gets more finely sliced in hopes of achieving scale at each step, so does the number of teams. e.g. What might have been a “Data Delivery Team” charged with delivering fresh data to customers unfortunately becomes “Data ingestion Team”, “Data processing Team” and “Data Release Team” (real world example).</p>
<p>This causes problems with both the core tenets of the autonomous team philosophy.</p>
<figure><img src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-1024x809.jpg" data-src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-1024x809.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-1024x809.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-300x237.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-768x607.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-1070x845.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions.jpg 1484w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-1024x809.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-300x237.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-768x607.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-1070x845.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions.jpg 1484w"></figure>
<p>The <strong>mission is diluted because most of the teams are now working on problems which are subsets of the original problem and as such not valuable in themselves</strong>. The success of a team can no longer guarantee the improvement of at least one business metric. The team’s work is not tied to a business objective any longer, so it gets tied to tightly defined execution scopes.”Data ingestion team” is supposed to pull in data, that’s it. While the team is still allowed to do this however it wants, succeeding in its objective will not mean that fresh data is being delivered to the customer. </p>
<p>Autonomy is diluted as a direct fallout. <strong>Where a single team could have come together to solve problems of data delivery, now multiple teams with different managers and different roadmaps must come together to deliver anything to the customer</strong>. This creates exactly the kind of coordination overhead that these small teams were created to solve in the first place.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Coordination, also known as alignment, communication, shared roadmap, Gantt chart and many other positive sounding names, is the arch-enemy of the autonomous team</strong>. </p>
<p>We have lots of small teams with lots of independence and no direct impact that keeping everyone pointed in one direction has become a nightmare. Program Managers paper over the ever-increasing complexity involved in coordinating priorities, efforts, and timelines, with developers and managers increasingly wash their hands of the whole business of communicating with other teams.</p>
<p>We took a good idea too far. The current “small” team is certainly small, but we forgot the part about reducing communication. Instead we are now offered “small, highly collaborative” teams as some sort of new ideal, as if high collaboration is something to be desired during execution.</p>
<p>This is a huge blind spot for organizations. The implicit goodness of small teams (devoid of any of the original context) is now internalized to such an extent that deep collaboration between small teams is considered a good thing in the organization. Team productivity and motivation keeps falling even as their sizes increase. And somehow we still believe this way of organizing work among teams is efficient, and something else must be causing the diminishing productivity.</p>

<h3>Collaboration is not good</h3>
<p>Collaboration is a great idea during ideation and brainstorming. It helps in getting a lot of input from lots of different people and can help us discover new aspects which we may not consider ourselves. It can expose other approaches to solving the problem, or even some versions of this problem that have already been solved by others. <strong>Broad stroked collaboration between people and systems is how we build something that is greater than the sum of its parts.</strong></p>
<p>However, <strong>once we reach the execution phase, collaboration is extremely costly.</strong> Collaboration means that two people or teams cannot just focus on doing their jobs, they also have to worry about when the other person is going to finish theirs and how they are going to synchronize with each other to hit the finish line.</p>

<p>I can quote any number of engineering principles to refute the deification of collaborative teams which seems to be the norm today.</p>
<p>In general, it is assumed that multithreading improves the performance of a system. This is completely true if each thread can execute completely independently on its own core without talking to any other thread or sharing any data. However, the moment we end with some shared state or more threads than CPUs, the synchronization overhead can quickly outstrip all the performance gains from using the technique.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Amdahl’s law</a> puts a finite upper limit on the increased output when an extra worker is added into the mix. The well-known problem is that every extra worker imposes non-parallelizable, exponentially increasing communication overhead. At some point, adding another worker makes things worse rather than better.</p>
<p>“<em>9 developers cannot finish a 9 month project in one month</em>” is a well-known idea in software management. And yet we see managers trying to grow and manage their teams in isolation. Why is that?</p>
<p>My hypothesis is that we see individual teams delivering quickly and we interpret this to mean that adding more members to these teams will further scale the output. In a world where we examine teams by isolating them from the overall system context, it is very easy to confuse independent with autonomous.</p>
<h3>Independence is not Autonomy</h3>
<p>In a highly collaborative setup, the correct way of looking at the organization is like a factory floor. <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints#:~:text=The%20theory%20of%20constraints%20(TOC)%20is%20an%20overall%20management%20philosophy,Critical%20Chain%2C%20published%20in%201997." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Theory of constraints</a></strong> tells us that the only way to increase output in this situation is to broaden the bottlenecks and widen the entire “flow of work” from conception to final delivery to the customer.</p>
<figure><img src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1024x349.jpg" data-src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1024x349.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1024x349.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-300x102.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-768x262.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1536x523.jpg 1536w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1070x365.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams.jpg 1916w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1024x349.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-300x102.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-768x262.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1536x523.jpg 1536w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1070x365.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams.jpg 1916w"></figure>
<p>But when we look at each step individually and out of context of the rest of the “pipeline”, “delivery” takes on a very different meaning. It just means “out of my door”. Any attempts to improve output with such a perspective will only create local maxima which means nothing for the final output – it might even be detrimental.</p>
<p>This is where we end up with too many small teams which are only looking at their little slice of work. That is what they are incentivised to do. If the outputs of our teams are arranged sequentially, they are not autonomous in delivery, no matter how independent they might be in their day to day work.</p>
<p>Anyone who has managed a supply chain can tell, independent teams organized in a sequential manner MANDATE a lot of communication and feedback. The lines of communication have not been removed by the creating small teams – they have been multiplied manifold. What’s worse, communication is happening at team boundaries where it is actually the weakest (the <a href="https://kislayverma.com/programming/overcoming-io-overhead-in-micro-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">communication overhead in microservices</a> springs to mind readily).</p>

<p>Without an autonomous mission, independent teams are forever shackled by the communication overhead.</p>
<h3><strong>Autonom</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> is a customer facing construct</strong></h3>
<p>What happens if we organize our independent teams by problem statement rather than function? A team that is authorized to solve a customer problem using any means at its disposal in essence owns the entire “pipeline” of tasks that need to be done. There is no cross-team collaboration and communication required for this team to do its job. This team not only operates independently, it also delivers value to the customer independently.</p>
<p><strong>A team is autonomous when it “delivers value to the customer” independently</strong>. In his novel “<a href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/8185984565?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=kislayverma-21&amp;camp=3638&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=8185984565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Goal</a>“, Eliyahu M. Goldratt highlights this beautifully by having his protagonist (who is plant manager) define his success to mean increased sales. Sales is usually not the problem of the manufacturing team, but the novel highlights how defining a customer facing “global” goal transforms the poorly …</p></div></article></div>

July 28, 2020 | https://antmedia.io/the-first-hevc-h265-support-in-webrtc/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://antmedia.io/the-first-hevc-h265-support-in-webrtc/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>We are very happy to announce that Ant Media Server v2.1 is released with some more great new features such as HEVC(H.265) support in WebRTC stack and WebM Recording. Previously <a href="https://antmedia.io/webrtc-vp8-data-channel-and-4k-60fps-support/">In Ant Media Server v2.0</a>, VP8 and <a href="https://antmedia.io/webrtc-chat-and-file-transfer/">Data Channel</a> features were released. We are continuously adding new features and doing performance optimizations. Before starting the post, let me thank you for your all interest to the Ant Media Server because you’ve made it run in more than 120 countries.After a brief introduction, let’s start the post.</p> <p>I think the most important feature in this release is the HEVC (H.265) support in WebRTC stack because it shows that what Ant Media can do beyond the limits in the industry. Of course, there are many more features and improvements such WebM recording, Unified Plan or PlanB,&nbsp; forcing quality in WebRTC playback, etc. Let me give the highlights for v2.1 and then you can also take a look the <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/releases/tag/ams-v2.1.0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">whole change log</a> for sure.</p> <h2>HEVC(H.265) Support in WebRTC Stack</h2> <p>I think the main question is about why it’s important to add HEVC aka. H265 support in WebRTC stack. The answer is clear: <strong>Providing better quality with the same bitrate.</strong></p> <p><img src="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HEVC_main_1024x1024.jpg" alt="Ant Media Server HEVC Support in WebRTC" width="1022" height="376" srcset="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HEVC_main_1024x1024.jpg 1022w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HEVC_main_1024x1024-300x110.jpg 300w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HEVC_main_1024x1024-768x283.jpg 768w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HEVC_main_1024x1024-600x221.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1022px) 100vw, 1022px" title="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 1"></p> <p>Let me tell what we’ve done in Ant Media Server side. We originally use the <a href="https://webrtc.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">WebRTC stack implemented by Google</a> and we’ve made it scalable to work in the server side. The recent changes is adding packetization and depacketization of HEVC frames in RTP protocol according to the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7798" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RFC 7789</a> and adapting these changes to the WebRTC stack.&nbsp; &nbsp;We’ve also adapted these changes to the Android WebRTC SDK because most of the android devices have H.265 decoder to play the H.265 encoded WebRTC Stream.&nbsp; Before proceeding how to test HEVC, let us tell that HEVC support is an experimental feature for now.</p> <h2>How to Play HEVC WebRTC Stream in Ant Media Server</h2> <p>Most of the devices(mobile or desktop) do not have H.265 Encoder to be able use in WebRTC stack. Luckily, Android devices have H.265 decoder to play H.265 encoded streams. So it works as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Enable H.265 in Ant Media Server</li> <li>Send RTMP stream to Ant Media Server</li> <li>Play H.265 WebRTC stream in Android Device</li> </ol> <h3>1. Enable H.265 in Ant Media Server</h3> <p>By default H.265 support is disabled in Ant Media Server so we need to enable it first. After you install the Ant Media Server,</p> <ul> <li>Open the following file <pre>/usr/local/antmedia/webapps/WebRTCAppEE/WEB-INF/red5-web.properties</pre> </li> <li>Enable H265 by adding below property to the file above <pre>settings.h265Enabled=true</pre> <p>I think we should also point out that Ant Media Server uses libx265 for soft encoding and it also support hevc_nvenc for hard encoding.</p></li> <li>Then make the following changes in the file as follows <pre>settings.vp8Enabled=false
settings.h264Enabled=false
settings.encoderSettingsString=360,800000,64000</pre> </li> <li>Save the file and restart the Ant Media Server <pre>sudo service antmedia restart</pre> </li> </ul> <h3>2. Send RTMP stream to Ant Media Server</h3> <p>You can send RTMP stream to Ant Media Server with <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/Open-Broadcaster-Software-Publishing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">OBS as documented here</a>. Just send a stream with height 360p or over.</p> <h3>3. Play H.265 WebRTC stream in Android Device</h3> <p>With the new Android SDK, you don’t need to do anything. Just add your server address to the MainActivity and change the mode to Play and open the Activity. It’ll play the H.265 Encoded WebRTC on your Android Device. You can even check the incoming and outgoing SDPs to see the HEVC parameters there.</p> <h4>Good news for Android and IOS SDKs</h4> <p>We’ve decided to provide Android and iOS SDK’s for free. It’ll be available to download on <a href="https://antmedia.io/">antmedia.io</a> later this week.</p> <h2>WebM Recording</h2> <p>In this release, we’re also happy to announce WebM Recording. You can configure WebM recording the same way you do for MP4 recording.&nbsp; Let me tell what I mean.</p>  <h2>Improved Performance and Stability</h2> <p>We constantly improve performance and stability. With this release, there are less threads in both Java and Native side. It means there are less context switching in the same name number of publishers and viewers according to the previous version. We’ve also optimized the WebRTC Stack&nbsp; to make it consume less resources.</p> <p><img src="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/java-concurrency-tutorial-introduction-1.png" alt="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 2" width="489" height="302" srcset="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/java-concurrency-tutorial-introduction-1.png 489w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/java-concurrency-tutorial-introduction-1-300x185.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px" title="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 4"></p> <p>Second improvement is about stability. We’ve improved our devops pipeline for cluster tests. So we’re having more integration test cases for both standalone and cluster modes.

Let me explain it. When there are multi-bitrates in the server side, Ant Media Server measures the viewers internet speed and sends the best quality according to the internet speed of the viewer.&nbsp; For instance,</p> <ul> <li>Assume that there are two bitrates on the server <ul> <li>First one is 360p and 800kbps</li> <li>Second one is 480p and 1500kbps.</li> </ul> </li> <li>if Viewer internet speed <ul> <li>is above 1500kbps, then the resolution with 480p is sent.</li> <li>is between 800kbps and 1500kbps or less than 800kbps, then the resolution with 360p is sent.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>This is done automatically on the server side. However some users want to force the resolution and don’t want to the server to make it automatically.&nbsp; So we’ve defined a new message in websocket communication&nbsp; and implement it on server side and JS SDK side. It’s <em>forceStreamQuality&nbsp; </em>which is having two parameters <em>streamId</em> and <em>streamHeight.&nbsp; </em>You can get the streamHeights information by <em>getStreamInfo </em>message. Let me explain how.</p> <p><img src="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1080p-720p-comparison-e1498827328347.jpg" alt="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 4" width="360" height="240" srcset="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1080p-720p-comparison-e1498827328347.jpg 360w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1080p-720p-comparison-e1498827328347-300x200.jpg 300w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1080p-720p-comparison-e1498827328347-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" title="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 6"></p> <p>Assume that you are <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/WebRTC-Playing" rel="dofollow noopener" target="_blank">playing a WebRTC stream</a> that has some <a href="https://antmedia.io/adaptive-streaming-is-supported-for-live-streams-on-the-fly/">adaptive bitrates</a> on the server side. It means that you’ve created WebRTCAdaptor and call <em>getStreamInfo </em>after you receive <em>play_started</em> message.</p> <pre>webRTCAdaptor.getStreamInfo("{your_stream_Id}");</pre> <p>The method above will trigger the <em>streamInformation </em>callback and you can parse it with the <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/StreamApp/blob/master/src/main/webapp/player.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">same way in this file</a>. Then the only thing is calling <em>forceStreamQuality </em>as follows.</p> <pre>webRTCAdaptor.forceStreamQuality("{your_stream_Id}",&nbsp; {the_resolution_to_be_forced});</pre> <p>We’ll provide this to be very easy to use in the embedded player as a built-in feature in the next release.</p> <p>To sum up,&nbsp; these are the highlights for v2.1. You can check <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/releases/tag/ams-v2.1.0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">whole release notes here</a> .Thank you again for your interest to Ant Media Server and we have some more exciting things on their way.

<br><img src="http://www.niquette.com/books/images/IllumLet/i.gif" nosave="" height="33" width="11"><span size="+1">n
October, 1953, I coined the word 'software.'</span>
<p><span size="+1">The notion of software as a separate thing from hardware
took years to assert itself. Sure, the computer (popularly referred to
as a "giant brain" in the early fifties) was unable to do anything but
consume electrical power until a "programmer" came along to "program" it,
and the consequent "routines" resided in the computer's "memory" thereafter.
One did not, in the beginning, take a program written for one computer
and put it into another.&nbsp; A half-century later, most people will find
that hard to imagine.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">As originally conceived, the word 'software' was merely
an obvious way to distinguish a program from the computer itself. A program
comprised sequences of written -- changeable -- instructions each endowed
with the power to command the behavior of the permanently crafted machinery
-- the "hardware."</span>
</p><p><a name="retdict"></a><span size="+1">For the origin of the word 'software,'
most <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppA.htm#typdict">dictionaries</a> give an unknown source
and 1960 as the date, but [expletive deleted] I was there! That's the only
exclamation point I intend to use in this introduction.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">Fifty years ago, I was writing programs for the SWAC at
UCLA, one of only 16 digital computers in the whole U.S. When I was first
struck by the word 'software' (it was an epiphany), I shook my head and
chuckled.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">When I first said 'software' out loud, people around me
said, "Huh?" From the very beginning I found the word too informal to write
and often embarrassing to say. Nevertheless, with smirking trepidation
I did occasionally feature the word 'software' in speeches and lectures
and media interviews throughout the fifties.</span>
</p><p><a name="retneol"></a><span size="+1">It was just a throw-away thing.
The word 'software' was hardly my most notable invention, even back then.
Nothing to write home about (I was only 19 years old and still living at
home).&nbsp; The word 'software' did not belong in a technical paper (besides,
an undergraduate is but a ghostwriter for principal researchers).&nbsp;
Then too, I had a reputation at UCLA as a practical joker. Colleagues and
friends simply shrugged, no doubt regarding each utterance as a tiresome
prank or worse, another offbeat neologism, for which I was also becoming
<a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppD.htm#sniglets">noted</a>.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">Nobody in 1953 would have guessed that the silly word
would take hold, that within a few decades 'software' would enter the general
vocabulary for products and for professions -- that a worldwide industry
would wear it as a solemn name. You can be sure that if my ego and I had
harbored any such glorious visions, then... then, what?</span>
</p><p><a name="re38k"></a><img src="http://www.niquette.com/books/images/IllumLet/a.gif" nosave="" height="33" width="33"><span color="#000000"><span size="+1">t
the time of this writing, there are about 4.2 million issued patents (I
once met Bob Hudson, inventor of an asphalt recycling machine for which
he was awarded U.S. Patent No. 4,000,000 -- but I digress). There must
be at least that many more worldwide -- a total, say, of 10 million. Every
patent has some number of "claims" (my largest -- ahem -- for the first
digital cassette recorder has 106 claims). Each patent-claim is, in effect,
a separate invention, an average of perhaps ten per patent. So there must
be at least a hundred million officially recognized inventions in the world.
Punch Line: There are only <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppD.htm#38k">38,000 words</a> in the
English Language.</span></span>
</p><p><span size="+1"><i>Nota bene</i>, the hundred million issued patent-claims
officially recognize only a small fraction of the world's inventions, but
the rest are inventions just the same. An inventor does <i>not</i> apply
for patent protection for each and every idea before reducing it to practice.&nbsp;
Likewise, a person inventing a word does <i>not </i>submit it for publication
in a dictionary before speaking it or writing it.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">By comparison to other inventions, words are rare indeed.
One reason is that there is no commercial value to them, which is why patents
do not apply to words: You want to say "<a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/101words/holomrph.htm">holomorph</a>"?
-- get out your checkbook. Copyrights don't make sense either, since a
word uncopied has no linguistic value at all. Trademarks, truth be known,
protect the interests of buyers not sellers; accordingly, a "wordmark"
would benefit listeners and readers not speakers and writers. Words are
<i>coined</i>
and thus spent -- circulated, borrowed, defaced, worn out, and lost.</span>
</p><p><img src="http://www.niquette.com/books/images/IllumLet/d.gif" nosave="" height="33" width="30"><span size="+1">ictionaries
are not gate keepers like the Patent Office but merely infrequent periodicals,
passively reporting on linguistic usage, relying necessarily on snippets
in published documents -- in non-dictionaries. Once usage for an invented
word becomes established, however, the etymological trail gets cold quickly,
and if the original utterance is undocumented, even a linguistic bloodhound
may not pick up the scent of the true inventor. Pity the verbal coiner,
unrewarded, unacclaimed, unattested.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1"><span color="#000000">Inventors themselves, it seems plain,
do a whole lot better job of inventing <i>things</i> than inventing words
to call things. The bicycle got its 'pedal' from the piano, the engine
appropriated 'piston' from the trombone, the airplane named its 'fuselage'
from the sewing spindle and its 'empennage' from the tail feathers of an
arrow.&nbsp; </span>Millions of inventions apply to computers, both hardware
and software. Readers are invited to check <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/sophmag/compsci.htm">What's
Not in a Name?</a> and <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/sophmag/mukashi.htm">Mukashi </a>for
lamentations about the dearth of inventive language in 'The Software Age'.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">'The Software Age' -- now, there's an ambitious coinage.
The previous sentence deserves an exclamation point and so does the next
one. Without software, there would be neither "The Computer Age" nor "The
Information Age."&nbsp; Same for "The Space Age."&nbsp; Meanwhile, is "The
Atomic Age" officially over? How much longer will "The Petroleum Age" last?
Accordingly, does 'The Software Age<b>'</b> have any real competition?</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">All right, so one can get a patent on an invention, a
copyright on a book, a trademark on a name, but what does one get to assert
primacy as the originator of a word? As noted above, t<span color="#000000">here
is no proprietary instrument that protects a word. Nor, of course, would
one want one ("I'll sue you if you use that term, I have the 'wordright'
on it"). On the contrary, t</span>he idea is to put each coinage into currency,
not horde it away.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">And then the grandkids grow up and there comes a time
to write one's memoirs.&nbsp; This one is dedicated to my first great-grandchild,
<a href="http://www.niquette.com/selections/charlotte/charlotte1.htm">Charlotte</a>.</span></p></div></div></div>]]>

July 28, 2020 | https://rockset.com/press/rockset-shatters-operational-barriers-for-real-time-analytics/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rockset.com/press/rockset-shatters-operational-barriers-for-real-time-analytics/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong><em>Serverless approach to real-time analytics now decouples storage from compute in the cloud to outperform operational model of Elasticsearch, Apache Druid and others</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>SAN MATEO, Calif.</strong> – July 28th, 2020 – <a href="https://rockset.com/">Rockset</a>, the real-time indexing database company, today announced new product features—including decoupling of storage from compute in the cloud, and separation of query-compute from ingest-compute—further eliminating the operational barriers in achieving real-time analytics at scale.</p>
<p>To stay ahead in the digital economy, companies need to personalize user experiences, build real-time decision systems and automate actions using sensor data. These types of  applications demand both very low latency and complex analytical queries on a variety of data formats from different sources. Since real-time data is messy and bursty, the high operational cost and complexity in ingesting and querying real-time data at scale has been a major barrier for enterprises moving from batch to real-time.</p>
<p>Built by the creators of <a href="https://rockset.com/blog/rocksdb-is-eating-the-database-world/">RocksDB</a>, Rockset automatically builds Converged Indexes™ on any data—including structured, semi-structured, geographical and time series data—for high performance search and analytics at scale. It supports real-time SQL queries on semi-structured data, so for the first time ever, developers have the flexibility to build features that search, aggregate and join any type of data from any source on the fly. When combined with serverless operations, it is a game-changing approach to making real-time analytics fast, flexible and easy.</p>
<p>With this new release, Rockset decouples query-compute, ingest-compute and hot storage in the cloud, allowing developers to scale the exact resources needed in the cloud and seamlessly adapt to variability. Traditional systems suffer from compute contention during bursty ingest or spikes in queries, so data becomes stale and queries slow down—making it operationally challenging to enable real-time decisions. Separating query compute from ingest compute avoids resource contention, and as a result, data freshness is guaranteed and query performance is never compromised. Additionally, while new data continues to stream in, old data grows over time and is less frequently queried. Scaling storage independently from compute allows customers to seamlessly control their price-performance over the lifecycle of the dataset, simply by adjusting the compute allocation over time.</p>
<p>Rumble Wellness, a company that encourages a healthy lifestyle by rewarding users based on their daily step count, uses real-time data to increase user engagement. "Rockset is pure magic. We chose Rockset over Druid, because it requires no planning whatsoever in terms of indexes or scaling. In one hour, we were up and running, serving complex OLAP queries for our live leaderboards and dashboards at very high queries per second. As we grow in traffic, we can just ‘turn a knob’ and Rockset scales with us," said Yaron Levi, Chief Architect at Rumble Wellness.</p>
<p><strong>With the new release:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Data is served from hot storage, and automatically backed up on durable cloud storage, with per-GB pricing.</li>
<li>Compute resources are scaled independently as required, with per-minute billing.</li>
<li>The compute resources are used for ingesting data or querying data from hot storage. Scaling compute resources results in instant performance gains.</li>
</ul>
<p>“First-generation real-time analytics solutions like Elasticsearch and Druid tightly coupled storage and compute because they were optimized for the datacenter era. But this leads to over-provisioning of resources and makes it difficult to manage costs at scale,” said Dhruba Borthakur, co-founder and CTO, Rockset. “On the other hand, scaling storage and compute independently in the cloud provides the benefits of improved scalability, availability and better price-performance ratios. Rockset’s cloud-native architecture and serverless technology already enables massive operational gains for customers, and these new features will further enable developers to achieve real-time analytics at scale.”</p>

As we’ve grown and raised money, we’ve graduated in some areas to other tools, but I wanted to share what we felt were the absolute can’t-live-without-tools for a team building SaaS software. I don’t have any vested interest in any of these apps, they’re just the ones we settled on as we spun up, they worked perfectly, integrated where we needed, and were either free or very cheap.</span></p><ol><li id="viewer-33kep"><p><a href="https://gsuite.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Google Apps</strong></u></span></a><strong><span>.</span></strong><span> We knew going in we’d want to centralize authentication around Google SSO, and didn’t want to have to go back later and move everything over after setting up simple sign-in. A bonus for us has been how strong Google now plays with Microsoft docs - when we receive Keypoint presos, Excel sheets, Word docs like MSAs etc., we’re able to do everything in Google and send it back, and not a one of us have a MS license. And an added unexpected bonus has been that Google Meet (or whatever its called this week) has worked surprisingly well for our internal meetings and standups etc. And at $6 per user pm, it fit our budget.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-fdt4q"><p><a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Slack</strong></u></span></a><span>. No-brainer.

We’re all Atlassian old-timers, so didn’t really consider anything else, and it being free to start again matches our budget. We have looked at a few other issue trackers eg Clubhouse since starting up to figure out integrations, and tbh just aren’t seeing that anything yet comes close to the power of Jira’s workflows, issue states, etc. </span></p></li><li id="viewer-48g4s"><p><a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Github</strong></u></span></a><strong><span>/</span></strong><a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Bitbucket</strong></u></span></a><span>.

We started out only paying $28 for QBO which is nuts given we were able to tie together all our bank/card accounts, do budgeting, pay bills, run payroll (once we started paying people), etc. and are only up to $70 now with the additional modules we’ve added.

We added Carta for managing equity, Datadog and Sentry for deployment metrics, LaunchDarkly for feature flags, SalesForce and Outreach for CRM and email campaigns, Figma for design iteration, etc., but even still our total spend across all tools is less than $500 a month.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>This post is personal one. It is a painful one. I adapted the reflections that I sent to Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke, and Peter Rosseau recently. I have largely redacted names, except for public interactions or my own correspondences.</p>
<p>Everyone who is privileged enough to hold a PhD in economics should reflect on our toxic culture. Before you start, read the American Economics Association (AEA)&nbsp; <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/code-of-conduct">code of professional conduct</a> and <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/aea-policy-harassment-discrimination">policy on harassment and discrimination</a>.</p>
<p>Students please understand that I and many others are working to make your journey better than ours. Economics is hard enough without others who demean you. I love the energy of youth; however, you need allies. We all do.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I am healthy now, due to my hard work in managing my bipolar disorder and the loved ones who carry me when I struggle.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Burn it down: economics failed us.</em></strong></h2>
<p>Economics is a disgrace. The lack of diversity and inclusion degrades our knowledge and policy advice. We hurt economists from undergraduate classrooms to offices at the White House. We drive away talent; we mistreat those who stay; and we tolerate bad behavior.</p>
<p>Some experiences I share may seem innocuous. Taken together, they demonstrate a systemic problem. One economists refuse to tackle. We blame bad behavior on victims. I was blamed. We tell them to toughen up. I was and did. We say the harasser is good economist and imply the victim is not. He was supposedly better than me. He is not.</p>
<p>I chose to name the senior men economists [many redacted here], who hurt me and others. They are well-respected. You know them. By doing nothing, you allow them to hurt people. You allow them to teach bad behavior to the next generation. I did too. I blame myself and did not speak up. I am sorry, and that is why I am sharing now. I am not filing a complaint. I am sharing. After more than a decade as a macroeconomist, I am fine. You know me. It is painful to share a part of me you did not know. It is painful to revisit. I do not name names to tar and feather. I do it to make our problem concrete.</p>
<p>I mentor many people. They come to me as an ally, as someone who will listen. I do. Some conversations are happy, people looking for advice on how to be an economist. Some conversations are sad, people dealing with painful experiences in economics. Some get better. Some do not. Last year a Black woman undergrad asked me how to get from her satellite-school state university to a PhD program in economics. We talked and I gave her advice. I emailed her a few months later to see what she had decided.&nbsp; Her brother replied that his sister had killed herself. She will not be an economist. Other became economists then we drove them away. The tenure of a Native American woman economist was revoked after her men colleagues turned on her. I talk with her regularly. We talk about how she could return to academia after she is healthy again. Do you know how many Native American women are economist? Very few. Do you know how many Black economists work at the Fed? One out of 406. Economics is a disgrace.</p>
<p>The indignities are astounding. The new woman economist at the Board who was asked by the men colleagues at lunch if she “satisfied” her husband. Her husband is an economist I know well. An officer sabotaged her work . She moved to another group. He stayed. I have talked with the woman and her husband several times. Broke my heart. Her tormentor is good friends with mine. I thought it was me. It was not me. It was them and they have not stopped. I told her she would get better. I did. No one told me that in 2011 when I broke. I was told that I was not the first woman he targeted. WTF? No one told me I could report him. WTF?? Both tormentors are senior officers at the Board, instrumental to monetary policy decisions. Neither said they were sorry.</p>
<p>Or how about the Southeast Asian research assistant, who I met once? He called me hyperventilating as he told about his abusive work environment. After I hung up, I closed my door and sat in my office sobbing. Economists messed him up. I coached him on how to leave his job and find a new one. He did.</p>
<p>Finally, the woman economics major at Chicago, who went to office hours. She sat on the floor since the room was crowded. Her professor offered her a chair. She said she was fine sitting on the floor. He looked at her and said, “I see you like it on your knees; women do.” Oh yes, and he had had to apologize for telling a sexually explicit ‘joke’ in public. He continues to teach undergraduates.[If I ever cross paths with this old nasty man, I will beat the shit out of him.] Economics breaks people and it is broken. I am angry. You should be too.</p>
<p>I mainly share my experiences here. I am NOT special. Many have similar experiences, in some cases worse. I have written documents to back these incidents up. It is awful to have these records in my email inbox, my Twitter, my text messages. Do not tell me, good men are economists too. I do not care. You did not protect the victims. You did not protect me. You had to know something was wrong, and you did nothing. I spend considerable time picking up the pieces of people we break. It is not fair. It is wrong what we do.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Economics destroys its students</em></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>We discourage undergraduates, women and men from studying economics. The <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/resources/member-docs/final-climate-survey-results-sept-2019">AEA’s first climate survey</a> of economics clearly shows our toxic profession, especially among under-represented groups. The AEA should commission surveys of undergraduates, research assistants, pre- and postdoctoral students. Harassment begins in undergraduate classrooms and often does not stop unless you leave economics.</li>
<li>We do not nurture the next generation. Many graduate students and economists have mental health issues. <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/4/26/econ-grads-peer-support-network/">Research at Harvard</a> found notably higher rates of depression and anxiety among economics PhD students than other PhD students and the general population. Departments often do send students to campus health resources. The faculty place unrealistic expectations on the students. They are aggressive in private and in public settings. They do not mentor, even when they agree to be their advisors. Faculty suffer too. [Krueger, Weitzman, Sandholm, Farhi, rest in peace. I am so sorry.]</li>
<li>Last year, I reviewed several&nbsp;macro job market papers.&nbsp; I read their abstracts, introductions, and tables/charts. I reviewed students from MIT to India to Stockholm to Santa Barbara and everywhere in between. &nbsp;All their papers were technically impressive and they also benefited from better communication. I tried to help. It was advice not an order. They worked hard on every aspect of their research. [I apologize that my original phrasing was not appropriate. It was an honor to be a part of their journey.]&nbsp; They thanked and many said it added to the support from their professors. Some replies suggested that we could do more for our students, such as::
<ul>
<li>You are the first person who has read any part of my job market paper.</li>
<li>I finally understand my paper.</li>
<li>Our department does not teach us how to write.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Let me be clear, many advisors including the students&nbsp; (part and not part of my review) have support in their departments. Unfortunately some departments do teach writing. Many do. I got encouragement at Michigan. Some did not. I know too many graduates student that economists hurts. We must do better. Absolutely must. I will do better too.</li>
<li>After I saw some common issues, I wrote a <a href="http://macromomblog.com/2019/09/29/we-need-to-talk-more/">blog post on writing</a> for all job market candidates. It is my most read post by far. I was surprised. My advisor, Matthew Shapiro, taught me how to write research papers. Many advisors do not. Some do. I <a href="http://macromomblog.com/2019/12/15/joy-to-the-macro-world/">blogged each of the students revised papers</a>. I cheered &nbsp;them on during the job market. Once a woman candidate thanked me. My email came after an exhausting flyout in the middle of an exhausting week of flyouts. None of these students were my responsibility. I was a section chief, managing five economists, two early career, and three research assistants. We can all do more.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong><em>Predators target research assistants, graduate students, and early-career economists</em></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Research assistants and pre-doctoral fellows are particularly vulnerable. Many are considering a career in economics; however, they do know the culture of economics. They have not chosen to navigate our aggressive norms. The explosion of pre-doctoral programs is a looming disaster. Basically, no economists who supervise these young adults have formal management training. The Board now sends every group manager and section chief to a months-long training. Training does not avoid all bad behavior. No training is much worse.</li>
<li>The Board is now recruiting research assistants from under-represented minorities. Even so, Black and Latinx research assistants vastly outnumber the economists of color. Research assistants have the least power at work. They often have bad experiences. One afternoon, a Black woman research assistant at the Board delivered forecast memos to a White officer. The officer thanked her, &nbsp;using the name of another Black woman research assistant. She corrected her. Six weeks later the officer made the same mistake. The research assistant gave up and asked one of the White research assistants to deliver memos to that officer.</li>
<li>Two research assistants, a Black Latinx woman and a Latinx man, designed the first Research Assistant Survey at the Board. I saw the first drafts, as someone who designs surveys. I could see from the start that the results would be uncomfortable. The discomfort of economists should not outweigh, but often does, the discomfort they cause. One striking finding: research assistants were reluctant to offer critical feedback because they were worried that as a result, they would not get a good recommendation for graduate school. Power dynamics are real and early career scholars do not have power. I was in the meeting where they presented the results to the officers and section chiefs. Not surprisingly, the men in the room tried to explain the uncomfortable findings away. It …</li></ul></div></div>

						<article id="post-4178">

                             
							<section itemprop="articleBody">

								<p><span>I cannot think of a better interlocutor than <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/">Chris Dilow</a>. He raises another set of interesting questions in his <a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2020/07/ideas-interests-and-capital.html">reply</a> to my <a href="https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/angrynomics-a-reply-to-chris-dillow/">reply</a>. I am in danger of completely forgetting our original divergence of thought, but that bothers me not at all.</span></p>
<p><span>I have read a lot of Marx, and always want to read more. Marx is rightly regarded as the greatest social theorist. Marx was legendary synthesiser of thought. In this regard, <a href="https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/values-in-economics/">Habermas</a> – the <a href="https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/the-most-important-social-scientist-since-keynes/">greatest moral philosopher since Kant</a> – is his true heir. </span></p>
<p><span>Marx also created a framework of making sense of social change, organisation and power which is unrivalled in its completeness and coherence. In addition to his profound perceptiveness, this very coherence and completeness appeals in its own right. But I feel a different form of intellectual affinity with Marx. The coherence he attributes to social evolution is also the weakness in his framework. Marx, if you take his writing as a whole, knew this instinctively. There is a coherent theory of social evolution to be found in his writings, but there is also repeated arbitrary divergence from this theory and creative, chaotic asides that make his writing so absorbing. We can thank Marx for providing a theory of social change, a theoretical ‘ideal type’. It is a model that it almost always pertinent, but – perhaps always – incomplete, and often completely misleading.</span></p>
<p><span>A perspective I have long held about markets I partly attribute to Marx. It is actually an argument for the moral force of markets (not capitalism, per se, but certainly markets) – that free exchange is the antithesis of tribalism. The great French anthropologist, Marcel Mauss, put it most succinctly: “In order to trade, we must first lay down our spear”. Marx, too, saw very clearly how global capitalism could be the enemy of tribal nationalism.</span></p>
<p><span>Perhaps intriguingly, I also want to bring Hayek in here. Hayek, Marx and Mauss view markets in ways which are far more instructive than that present in microeconomic textbooks. And here simplistic economic ideology has hindered understanding. So, one evolutionary function of markets is as a positive-sum method of conflict resolution. Everyone should be aware of this. If we perceive there to be a finite resource – say oil – let us use prices to determine who gets what, and incentivise the invention of substitutes. It’s better than the alternative. </span></p>
<p><span>Hayek diverges from the standard micro-theory of markets by assuming imperfect information – quite rightly – and focussing on the role markets play in processing information. This too is profoundly insightful. In Hayek’s view, capital seeks informational advantages – this is a motivating force. If we already knew everything, we would do nothing. The pursuit of ‘excess return’ is the very lifeblood of innovative and dynamic capital. </span></p>
<p><span>Hayek’s observations on the distribution of information are equally important. His critique of central planning significantly resides in the insight that the most important information is local to the individual and unobservable – it is in our heads. Only the individual knows what they want at any point in time.</span></p>
<p><span>As an aside, it is worth noting that Keynes, unsurprisingly, was the most astute psychologist in this cannon of thinkers on the motives of capital. He was totally open to the likelihood that many of the greatest investors – i.e. those that had the longest time-horizons and made the greatest contributions to human well-being – were motivated by nothing more than fascination at what could be achieved.</span></p>
<p><span>How does any of this bear on my discussion with Chris? My sense is that the motives and forms of capital at work in our societies are more diverse than at any point since the industrial revolution.  As Mark and I argue in <em><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Angrynomics-Eric-Lonergan/dp/1788212797/ref=sxts_sxwds-bia-wc-p13n1_0?adgrpid=100757164789&amp;cv_ct_cx=angrynomics&amp;dchild=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw0_T4BRBlEiwAwoEiAWWpdQP-57O0aMprUkKmpjQbVHNLZX8R0CBQQI7Zar3_prk6eVgopBoCIKEQAvD_BwE&amp;hvadid=435785345402&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9045955&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=17321262343375037874&amp;hvtargid=kwd-884601278301&amp;hydadcr=24397_1816021&amp;keywords=angrynomics&amp;pd_rd_i=1788212797&amp;pd_rd_r=9a0d48ba-8492-4b48-b95c-ff635870897b&amp;pd_rd_w=RS60x&amp;pd_rd_wg=H99aG&amp;pf_rd_p=9b1a9511-9af9-4d06-8643-d54ebec511ef&amp;pf_rd_r=AP1416WT4M1BSGAJVPF5&amp;psc=1&amp;qid=1595773559&amp;sr=1-1-fdbae751-0fa5-4c0f-900b-865654896618&amp;tag=googhydr-21">Angrynomics</a></em>, deregulation has set capital against capital, and asset price delusions add spice to this chaos. Myopic speculators finance blue-sky infinite-horizon destroyers of capital, such as Elon Musk – the world’s embodiment of a Keynesian investor.  Somewhat hilariously, a new form of elite social status – start-upism – is fantastically anti-capital, and its effects are super-charged by the secular collapse in the cost of semi-conductors. Despite its importance, none of this was predictable.</span></p>
<p><span>I struggle to see capital as the obstacle to progress in this world. If anything, a chaotic series of capitalist motivations – a collapse in the cost of debt to the state and a plethora of extraordinary technological innovations – have provided us with the very <a href="https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/PM-Europe-roundtable.pdf">means to tackle our greatest challenges</a>. The failure of innovation is in public policy and democratic process.</span></p>
<p><span>This leads me in conclusion to more a ominous question. Hayek explained why China could not succeed. Central planning doesn’t work because the most important information is in our heads – only we know what we want to do. Really? Why has China progressed more rapidly and pervasively than any other major economy in AI, machine learning, fintech and social media. Because the contents of our minds is now available to the social planner. Is Marx about to have the last laugh?</span></p>
