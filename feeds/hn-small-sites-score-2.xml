<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>One of the key elements of Google's software engineering culture is the use of defining software designs through design docs. These are relatively informal documents that the primary author or authors of a software system or application create before they embark on the coding project. The design doc documents the high level implementation strategy and key design decisions with emphasis on the trade-offs that were considered during those decisions.</p><p>As software engineers our job is not to produce code per se, but rather to solve problems. Unstructured text, like in the form of a design doc, may be the better tool for solving problems early in a project lifecycle, as it may be more concise and easier to comprehend, and communicates the problems and solutions at a higher level than code.</p><p>Besides the original documentation of a software design, design docs fulfill the following functions in the software development lifecycle:</p><ul><li><p>Early identification of design issues when making changes is still cheap.</p></li><li><p>Achieving consensus around a design in the organization.</p></li><li><p>Ensuring consideration of cross-cutting concerns.</p></li><li><p>Scaling knowledge of senior engineers into the organization.</p></li><li><p>Form the basis of an organizational memory around design decisions.</p></li><li><p>Acts as a summary artifact in the technical portfolio of the software designer(s).</p></li></ul><h2 id="anatomy-of-a-design-doc">Anatomy of a design doc <a href="#anatomy-of-a-design-doc">#</a></h2><p>Design docs are informal documents and thus don’t follow a strict guideline for their content. Rule #1 is: Write them in whatever form makes the most sense for the particular project.</p><p>Having said that, a certain structure has established itself as really useful.</p><h3 id="context-and-scope">Context and scope <a href="#context-and-scope">#</a></h3><p>This section gives the reader a very rough overview of the landscape in which the new system is being built and what is actually being built. This isn’t a requirements doc. Keep it succinct! The goal is that readers are brought up to speed but some previous knowledge can be assumed and detailed info can be linked to. This section should be entirely focused on objective background facts.</p><h3 id="goals-and-non-goals">Goals and non-goals <a href="#goals-and-non-goals">#</a></h3><p>A short list of bullet points of what the goals of the system are, and, sometimes more importantly, what non-goals are. Note, that non-goals aren’t negated goals like “The system shouldn’t crash”, but rather things that could reasonably be goals, but are explicitly chosen not to be goals. A good example would be “ACID compliance”; when designing a database, you’d certainly want to know whether that is a goal or non-goal. And if it is a non-goal you might still select a solution that provides it, if it doesn’t introduce trade-offs that prevent achieving the goals.</p><h3 id="the-actual-design">The actual design <a href="#the-actual-design">#</a></h3><p>This section should start with an overview and then go into details.</p><p><img alt="Visualization of how to draw an owl. First picture: two circles labeled &quot;1. Draw some circles&quot;. Second picture: Picture of an own labeled &quot;2. Draw the rest of the fucking owl&quot;" height="488" src="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZCBwPv.jpg" width="600" decoding="async" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" srcset="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZCBwPv-1920w.jpg 1920w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZCBwPv-1280w.jpg 1280w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZCBwPv-640w.jpg 640w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZCBwPv-320w.jpg 320w"></p><p>The design doc is <em>the place to write down the trade-offs</em> you made in designing your software. Focus on those trade-offs to produce a useful document with long-term value. That is, given the context (facts), goals and non-goals (requirements), the design doc is the place to suggest solutions and show why a particular solution best satisfies those goals.</p><p>The point of writing a document over a more formal medium is to provide the flexibility to express the problem set at hand in an appropriate manner. Because of this, there is no explicit guidance for how to actually describe the design.</p><p>Having said that, a few best practices and repeating topics have emerged that make sense for a large percentage of design docs:</p><h4 id="system-context-diagram"><strong>System-context-diagram</strong> <a href="#system-context-diagram">#</a></h4><p>In many docs a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_context_diagram">system-context-diagram</a></em> can be very useful. Such a diagram shows the system as part of the larger technical landscape and allows readers to contextualize the new design given its environment that they are already familiar with.</p><p><img alt="Block diagram showing how various systems are related to each other. The actual text is just examples and not needed to be seen to understand the example." height="333" src="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N.png" width="655" decoding="async" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" srcset="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-1920w.jpg 1920w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-1280w.jpg 1280w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-640w.jpg 640w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-320w.jpg 320w"><br><em>Example of a system-context-diagram.</em></p><h4 id="apis">APIs <a href="#apis">#</a></h4><p>If the system under design exposes an API, then sketching out that API is usually a good idea. In most cases, however, one should withstand the temptation to copy-paste formal interface or data definitions into the doc as these are often verbose, contain unnecessary detail and quickly get out of date. Instead focus on the parts that are relevant to the design and its trade-offs.</p><h4 id="data-storage">Data storage <a href="#data-storage">#</a></h4><p>Systems that store data should likely discuss how and in what rough form this happens. Similar to the advice on APIs, and for the same reasons, copy-pasting complete schema definitions should be avoided. Instead focus on the parts that are relevant to the design and its trade-offs.</p><h4 id="code-and-pseudo-code">Code and pseudo-code <a href="#code-and-pseudo-code">#</a></h4><p>Design docs should rarely contain code, or pseudo-code except in situations where novel algorithms are described. As appropriate, link to prototypes that show the implementability of the design.</p><h4 id="degree-of-constraint">Degree of constraint <a href="#degree-of-constraint">#</a></h4><p>One of the primary factors that would influence the shape of a software design and hence the design doc, is the degree of constraint of the solution space.</p><p>On one end of the extreme is the “greenfield software project”, where all we know are the goals, and the solution can be whatever makes the most sense. Such a document may be wide-ranging, but it also needs to quickly define a set of rules that allow zooming in on a manageable set of solutions.</p><p>On the other end are systems where the possible solutions are very well defined, but it isn’t at all obvious how they could even be combined to achieve the goals. This may be a legacy system that is difficult to change and wasn’t designed to do what you want it to do or a library design that needs to operate within the constraints of the host programming language.</p><p>In this situation you may be able to enumerate all the things you can do relatively easily, but you need to creatively put those things together to achieve the goals. There may be multiple solutions, and none of them are really great, and hence such a document should focus on selecting the best way given all identified trade-offs.</p><h3 id="alternatives-considered">Alternatives considered <a href="#alternatives-considered">#</a></h3><p>This section lists alternative designs that would have reasonably achieved similar outcomes. The focus should be on the trade-offs that each respective design makes and how those trade-offs led to the decision to select the design that is the primary topic of the document.</p><p>While it is fine to be succinct about solution that ended up not being selected, this section is one of the most important ones as it shows very explicitly why the selected solution is the best given the project goals and how other solutions, that the reader may be wondering about, introduce trade-offs that are less desirable given the goals.</p><h3 id="cross-cutting-concerns">Cross-cutting concerns <a href="#cross-cutting-concerns">#</a></h3><p>This is where your organization can ensure that certain cross-cutting concerns such as security, privacy, and observability are always taken into consideration. These are often relatively short sections that explain how the design impacts the concern and how the concern is addressed. Teams should standardize what these concerns are in their case.</p><p>Due to their importance, Google projects are required to have a dedicated privacy design doc, and there are dedicated reviews for privacy and security. While the reviews are only required to be completed by the time a project launches, it is best practice to engage with privacy and security teams as early as possible to ensure that designs take them into account from the ground up. In case of dedicated docs for these topics, the central design doc can, of course, reference them instead of going into detail.</p><h3 id="the-length-of-a-design-doc">The length of a design doc <a href="#the-length-of-a-design-doc">#</a></h3><p>Design docs should be sufficiently detailed but short enough to actually be read by busy people. The sweet spot for a larger project seems to be around 10-20ish pages. If you get way beyond that, it might make sense to split up the problem into more manageable sub problems. It should also be noted that it is absolutely possible to write a 1-3 page “mini design doc”. This is especially helpful for incremental improvements or sub tasks in an agile project–you still do all the same steps as for a longer doc, just keep things more terse and focused on a limited problem set.</p><h2 id="when-not-to-write-a-design-doc.">When <em>not</em> to write a design doc. <a href="#when-not-to-write-a-design-doc.">#</a></h2><p>Writing design docs is overhead. The decision whether to write a design doc comes down to the core trade-off of deciding whether the benefits in organizational consensus around design, documentation, senior review, etc. outweigh the extra work of creating the doc. At the center of that decision lies whether the solution to the design problem is ambiguous–because of problem complexity or solution complexity, or both. If it is not, then there is little value in going through the process of writing a doc.</p><p>A clear indicator that a doc might not be necessary are design docs that are really <em>implementation manuals</em>. If a doc basically says “This is how we are going to implement it” without going into trade-offs, alternatives, and explaining decision making (or if the solution is so obvious as to mean there were no trade-offs), then it would probably have been a better idea to write the actual program right away.</p><p>Finally, the overhead of creating and reviewing a design doc may not be compatible with prototyping and rapid iteration. However, most software projects do have a set of <em>actually known problems</em>. Subscribing to agile methodologies is not an excuse for not taking the time to get solutions to actually known problems right. Additionally, prototyping itself may be part of the design doc creation. “I tried it out and it works” is one of the best arguments for choosing a design.</p><h2 id="the-design-doc-lifecycle">The design doc lifecycle <a href="#the-design-doc-lifecycle">#</a></h2><p>The steps in the lifecycle of a design document are:</p><ol><li>Creation and rapid iteration</li><li>Review (may be in multiple rounds)</li><li>Implementation and iteration</li><li>Maintenance and learning</li></ol><h3 id="creation-and-rapid-iteration">Creation and rapid iteration <a href="#creation-and-rapid-iteration">#</a></h3><p>You write the doc. Sometimes together with a set of co-authors.</p><p>This phase quickly evolves into a time of rapid iteration where the doc is shared with colleagues who have the most knowledge about the problem space (often belonging to the same team) and through their clarifying questions and suggestions drive the doc to a first relatively stable version.</p><p>While you certainly find engineers and even teams who prefer version control and code …</p></article></div></div>

<![CDATA[Why ListenBrainz Moved from InfluxDB to TimescaleDB]]>

	<!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div>
		
<p>The <a href="https://listenbrainz.org/">ListenBrainz</a> team has been working hard on moving our primary listen store from <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/">InfluxDB</a> to <a href="https://www.timescale.com/">TimescaleDB</a>, and today at UTC 16:00 we’re going to make the switch.</p>



<p>We were asked on Twitter as to why we’re making the switch — and in the interest of giving a real world use case for switching, I’m writing this post. The reasons are numerous:</p>



<p><strong>Openness</strong>: InfluxDB seems on a path that will make it less open over time. TimescaleDB and its dependence on Postgres makes us feel much safer in this regard.</p>



<p><strong>Existing use</strong>: We’ve been using Postgres for about 18 years now and it has been a reliable workhorse for us. Our team thinks in terms of Postgres and InfluxDB  always felt like a round peg in a square hole for us.</p>



<p><strong>Data structure</strong>: InfluxDB was clearly designed to store server event info. We’re storing listen information, which has a slightly different usage pattern, but this slight difference is enough for us to hit a brick wall with far fewer users in our DB than we ever anticipated. InfluxDB is simply not flexible enough for our needs.</p>



<p><strong>Query syntax and measurement names</strong>: The syntax to query InfluxDB is weird and obfuscated. We made the mistake of trying to have a measurement map to a user, but <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-server/blob/b0846d2a/listenbrainz/utils.py#L42">escaping measurement names correctly</a> nearly drove one of our team members to the loonie bin. </p>



<p><strong>Existing data</strong>: If you ever write bad data to a measurement in InfluxDB, there is no way to change it. I realize that this is a common Big Data usage pattern, but for us it represented significant challenges and serious restrictions to put simple features for our users into place. With TimescaleDB we can make the very occasional UPDATE or DELETE and move on.</p>



<p><strong>Scalability</strong>: Even though we attempted to read as much as possible in order to design a scalable schema, we still failed and got it wrong. (I don’t even think that the docs to calculate scalability even existed when we first started using InfluxDB.) Unless you are using InfluxDB in exactly the way it was meant to be used, there are chances you’ll hit this problem as well. For us, one day insert speed dropped to a ridiculously low number per second, backing up our systems. Digging into the problem we realized that our schema design had a fatal flaw and that we would have drastically change the schema to something even less intuitive in order to fix it.  This was the event that broke the camel’s back and I started searching for alternatives. </p>



<p>In moving to TimescaleDB we were able to delete a ton of complicated code and embrace a DB that we know and love. We know how Postgres scales, we know how to put it into production and we know its caveats. TimescaleDB allows us to be flexible with the data and the amazing queries that can be performed on the data is pure Postgres love. TimescaleDB still requires some careful thinking over using Postgres, it is far less than what is required when using InfluxDB. TimescaleDB also gives us a clear scaling path forward, even when TimescaleDB is still working on their own scaling roadmap. If TimescaleDB evolves anything like Postgres has, I can’t wait to see this evolution.</p>



<p>Big big thanks to the Postgres and TimescaleDB teams! </p>

<![CDATA[GraphQL Query Generator Library by IBM]]>

July 22, 2020 | https://blog.graphqleditor.com/graphql-query-generator/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.graphqleditor.com/graphql-query-generator/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL Query Generator is an interesting library brought to you by the IBM team, which’s the main idea is to allow users to <strong>generate randomized GraphQL queries</strong> from any given GraphQL schema.</p>
<p>The first thought that comes to your mind might be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Why I may ever want a bunch of randomized queries?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>but giving it a second thought it might be quite useful. The team behind the GraphQL Query Generator suggested <strong>two basic use-cases</strong> for their library:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Engineering</strong> - when operating a GraphQL service you might find this library useful for:</p>
<ul>
<li>developing a collection of test modules of GraphQL queries,</li>
<li>developing a test group of queries to check the effect of performance improvements,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Scientific</strong> - to learn about the characteristics of various GraphQL services.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Queries generation</h2>
<p>The library provides two functions for generating random GraphQL queries, both expecting a GraphQL schema, as well as specific  instructions provided in configuration object as an input:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getRandomQuery(schema: GraphQLSchema, config: Configuration)</code> - this function produces a random query from the given schema, considering configuration passed as an input,</li>
<li><code>getRandomMutation(schema: GraphQLSchema, config: Configuration)</code> -  that produces a random mutation from the given schema, considering passed configuration.</li>
</ul>

<p>The configuration object accepts a set of predefined properties i.e.:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>maxDepth</code> - that defines the maximum depths of the query/mutation to generate,</li>
<li><code>argumentsToIgnore</code> - in which you can  list arguments names that should be ignored,</li>
<li><code>considerInterfaces</code>- which a signal for the generator that it should create queries containing interfaces,</li>
<li><code>considerUnions</code> - that creates queries that contain unions etc.</li>
</ul>

                        Making haskell web apps is a complicated process. You need the right haskell compiler, a build tool, lots of libraries to do useful things and a database software. To make IHP as accessible as possible, we want to initially hide all this from the user. We set out to make IHP usable for people who have not yet heard about ghc and cabal.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Additionally when you are using an older compiler version, some library is missing or your postgres is not the right version this will cause trouble. Solving these package management issues is always a huge time sink.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Npm is mainly used for packaging javascript code. Composer is used for packaging php code. And homebrew is used for installing npm and composer ;) Nix is different: It is able to package system software and all kinds of software ecosystems. This is what allows us to bundle all the dependencies of IHP using just a single package manager. Exactly what we need to make a truly batteries-included framework.
                    </p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Integrated Dev Tooling</strong>

                    <p>
                        Nix is unique in that it allows us to exactly specify the version of a package we want to install. We can say: <i>Install the latest <q>postgres 12.3</q></i>. Nix also allows us to install packages locally for a specific project instead of managing all the dependencies system wide.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        These two properties make nix a great fit to achive our goal of simplifying the package management process. Nix allows us to easily install all this software for developers working with IHP. We can install exactly the right compiler, the right postgres version as well as all the right libraries we need. We can be sure that all packages are installed in the right version (no time sinks!) and nothing is missing. We also don't have any interference with existing packages already installed on the system. It's like docker without the overhead of a VM.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The IHP dev server automatically starts and manages a postgres server in the background, just for your project. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23612217" target="_blank">IHP is the first framework tighly integrating the database in the dev mode.</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/zaiste/status/1277678880782979072" target="_blank">We're sure that this will be standard in a couple of years.</a> Without the possibilities of nix, we would have never tried to integrate postgres into the IHP dev server. The integrated database schema designer wouldn't really work that well. It might not be obvious, but without nix we would not have tools like the IHP schema designer or the database viewer.
                    </p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Pinned Versions</strong>

                    <p>
                        Nix makes IHP projects reproducable in a way unseen in other software ecosystems.
                        <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp-boilerplate/blob/master/Config/nix/nixpkgs-config.nix#L21" target="_blank">All IHP projects share exactly the same set of packages.</a> The same compiler version, the same libraries, the same postgres version and even the same custom dependencies your app depends on. <q>Works on my machine</q> will not happen anymore. When there is a problem, other IHP users will most likely already have faced the same issue. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is only possible because nix allows us to pin down the set of package definitions to a specific git commit of the nix package registry.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Trade Offs</strong>

                    <p>
                        Nix is far from perfect. Early on we had a lot of problems with slow rebuild times, which we could resolve by using the great <a href="https://cachix.org/" target="_blank">cachix</a> binary cache. Additionally Nix is very hard to install. This is a stumbling block for a lot of people. <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/issues/93" target="_blank">Especially when using certain macOS systems you cannot even install nix at all.</a> Luckily most of the nix problems, like the macOS issues will be solved with time. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once nix is set up, it's usually working very well. Over time the benefits of nix really outweight the time spent on solving nix-specific problems. The rising industry adoption of Nix is a good indicator for this. <a href="https://engineering.shopify.com/blogs/engineering/what-is-nix" target="_blank">Cool companies like Shopify are progressively adopting Nix.</a>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At digitally induced we believe that highest quality software is built on solid foundations.
                        Nix is technological superior to any other existing package manager. Therefore we belive it's right to make nix a hard requirement of IHP. 
                    </p>
                </li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>We’ve always believed that our user experience doesn’t just begin when people use elementary OS; it begins from the first moment that someone interacts with our organization in any way. And for a lot of people, that experience starts with our website. You may already know about <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/privacy-and-elementary-os">our stance on privacy</a>, advertising, and tracking from our previous blog posts, and that a core part of our business model is that <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/you-are-not-the-product">you are our customer, not a product</a>.</p>



<p>You might also know that our website has a comprehensive <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://elementary.io/privacy">privacy page</a> that details not only exactly how we use things like cookies on our website, but how to disable them. And with such a strong stance on privacy, you might be asking yourself why elementary uses analytics at all, let alone Google Analytics. To that I am happy to respond that we are leaving Google Analytics behind in favor of the Open Source and privacy-respecting <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-analytics">What Are Analytics?</h2>

<p>If you’re not familiar with the concept, you may be surprised to know that the majority of the websites you regularly visit are collecting statistical data about your usage of the website. Website developers then use this data to optimize infrastructure, pinpoint problems, or even drive design decisions—something we don’t particularly advise.</p>



<p>At elementary, we use anonymous data about things like physical region and download method to make sure we have properly localized HTTPS and Torrent downloads so that you can get a fast and stable connection. We also check which pages are most—and least—visited on our website so we know where to focus improvements. And we pay attention to which operating system downloaders are coming from to make sure that we’re on track with our mission of bringing an Open Source operating system to more people.</p>

<h3 id="why-not-google-analytics">Why Not Google Analytics?</h3>

<p>Google Analytics lets us keep tabs on that data, but Google tracks <em>a whole lot more</em> than that, too. Frankly we don’t want access to that data—or to contribute towards it being collected. Remember, Google’s incentive is to collect as much information as possible from people visiting as many sites as possible—and using Google Analytics directly helps them do that.</p>



<p>If you don’t know, Google happily tracks you across all the websites you visit if those sites use Google Analytics, or if you use Google search. Google then infers and remembers all sorts of information about you; for example: your age range, an inferred gender, if you’ve changed jobs or moved recently, and whether you like to spend time outdoors. Google then uses all of this data to target ads to you, in the hopes that more precise ads will get you to bite, thus earning them their commission.</p>

<p>They then offer those profiles up inside of Google Analytics, letting website owners drill down using “In-Market Segments.” The entire mechanism is invasive—and unnecessary for us. And even though we may choose to ignore these profiles and data, by using Google Analytics on our website, we’ve contributed to creating them. This data collection and surveillance does not align with our values, and we’ve been investigating how we can move away for quite some time now.</p>

<h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>

<p>Google Analytics is by far the most popular analytics solution available and there are few privacy-respecting alternatives. We considered a few self-hosted products like <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://matomo.org/">Matomo</a>, but we couldn’t find a good fit in terms of maintenance, pricing, and features. We also investigated using self-described privacy-focused <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a>, but were disappointed to learn that they had gone closed-source since we’d last looked at them. The situation changed once we stumbled upon Plausible.</p>

<p>Plausible is a small UK-based company that provides a hosted, privacy-conscious analytics solution with simple and fair pricing—plus support for custom events. The product itself fits what we’re looking for in an analytics solution, and it’s encouraging to see that they are actively growing and developing new features. But what really got our attention is their messaging around their business model. Read <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://plausible.io/blog/open-source-funding">their blog post on monetizing</a> and see if it sounds familiar.</p>

    No.</p><p>
    "Any interest in talking about an exit?"</p><p>
    No.</p></div>

  
</div>

<p>Unlike Google, Plausible isn’t in the advertising game and doesn’t have an incentive to collect and sell user data. And they’ve made it clear that they’re not interested in being scooped up by VCs or new ownership that might seek to change those values. They make money the same way elementary does: by directly charging customers for their product. We know firsthand how important it is to make sure that your business is built around your ethics, and we get the same feeling from the folks at Plausible. We’re excited to be supporting a company that shares our values and respects the people visiting our website.</p>

<h2 id="improving-transparency">Improving Transparency</h2>

<p>One of the most interesting and unique features of Plausible is their open invitation and celebration of data transparency. First, their entire product is open source; when it comes to privacy, the source code being open and auditable by anyone—experts and end users alike—is paramount. But they go above and beyond that: every user of Plausible is able and encouraged to make their analytics dashboard public so everyone can see the data for themselves and know that nothing fishy is going on.</p>



<p>We’ve embraced this new feature at elementary and opened up the dashboards for our various subdomains as well as our main website. Check them out yourself!</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://plausible.io/elementary.io">Main Website</a></li>
  <li><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://plausible.io/blog.elementary.io">Blog</a></li>

  <li><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://plausible.io/releases.elementary.io">Release Tracking</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We hope that this move will provide a tangible improvement to your digital life and give you even more peace of mind when using elementary products. We’re always working towards the ideal and we’re confident we’ve made a big step by switching to Plausible. Let us know on social media what you think of the new public analytics dashboard, and feel free to ask questions about how we’re using this data!</p>

<p><span>I</span>n April 2020, in the midst of an ongoing national lockdown, Ahmed Imran Kabir decided to buy a parrot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After most of the management classes Kabir taught at a university in Dhaka were canceled or moved online, he suddenly had plenty of time to focus on his passion project: becoming a part-time bird breeder. Sitting in his three-bedroom apartment one day, Kabir keyed in the phrase “Buy-sell birds Dhaka” on Facebook and joined about half a dozen groups dedicated to avian retail.</p>



<p>“Breeding pair. Age: 20 days. Contact by phone or inbox” read one post, alongside images of a pair of grayish-brown cockatiels. Another seller, located in the Kallyanpur neighborhood in Dhaka, posted pictures of yellow-feathered lutino cockatiels, with the Bengali phrase <em>hat bodol hobe — </em>which loosely translates as “to change hands.” The wording was intended to circumvent a Facebook algorithm that, to prevent wildlife trafficking, automatically takes down posts with “buy” or “sell” in the description. If an interested buyer did contact an owner, the next step was to haggle over the price of the bird on Facebook Messenger.</p>



<p>Kabir bought his first pair of birds from the 3,000-person Facebook group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/485404175472217/">A.S.ককাটেল পাখি হাত বদল</a> — “A.S. Cockatiel changes hands.” For that purchase, the seller delivered the birds in person to collect them, and Kabir paid in cash. He was so pleased with his decision that he bought 24 more pairs over the next two weeks, including breeds such as Gouldian finches, Bengalese finches, and crested Bengalese finches. Each pair cost anywhere between $15 and $60, depending upon the breed and its age. “At one point, I started running out of space to accommodate all the birds, and sent about half a dozen Bengalese finches, along with some Gouldians, to my fiancee’s place,” he recalled. Finally, he gave in and bought a large birdcage.</p>



<p>From discovery to delivery, this whole process happened on Facebook.</p>



<p>Kabir’s story is reflective of how the majority of e-commerce now happens in Bangladesh. In the absence of giant online marketplaces like Amazon, thousands of bespoke Facebook pages and groups have been created to meet customer demand for ornaments, apparel, cosmetics, mobile accessories, and, of course, birds.</p>



<p><strong>Read: <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/randi-rahbar-shopyobrand-iraq/"><em>“What do I do with a credit card in a country like Iraq?”</em></a></strong></p>



<p>The phenomenon has grown so much over the years that the number of stores on Facebook now eclipse the number of sellers on local e-commerce websites like Evaly, Ajkerdeal, or the Alibaba-acquired <a href="https://www.daraz.com.bd/">Daraz</a>. No one knows exactly how many of these businesses exist, but the most recent estimates suggest that Bangladesh <a href="https://idlc.com/mbr/article.php?id=192">has over 300,000</a>. The low barriers to entry —&nbsp;all an aspiring entrepreneur needs is an internet connection and around $350<strong> </strong>to cover startup costs —&nbsp;present a tremendous opportunity for a generation of young Bangladeshis reeling from mass layoffs and fear of <a href="https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/2019/06/28/rise-of-the-educated-unemployed">rising unemployment</a> rates, which are projected to impact at least 15% of the working population. It also has opened other doors: in a country where just over 15 percent of women have mobile internet access, <a href="https://idlc.com/mbr/article.php?id=192">half</a> of Facebook sellers are female.</p>



<p>By and large, these Facebook stores are usually window fronts for click-and-order shopping. Unlike in formal marketplaces, most sellers are not licensed, store their inventory at home, and partner with third-party logistics companies for last-mile delivery. It’s all very simple: after a buyer makes a selection, payments are arranged via off- or online methods, and items are delivered by mail. No equivalent exists in the West, where Facebook’s forays into commerce have been met with a muted response. For a 162-million-strong country struggling with poverty and limited job growth, this new model of business is illustrative of the South Asian concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugaad"><em>jugaad</em></a> — making do with what’s available. And it already has a name: F-commerce.&nbsp;</p>

<hr>



<p><strong>Nuzhat Akhter has</strong> been selling on Facebook for only six years, but she’s already considered a veteran in the F-commerce sphere. Her site, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/277430245935147/"><em>Posh World</em></a>, has over 8,000 followers on Facebook, thanks to her carefully cultivated selection of consumer<strong> </strong>goods. From her home in Bangladesh, Akhter sources all kinds of products — helmets, handbags, Ralph Lauren shirts, even branded car parts — and accepts preorders daily. If an item isn’t featured on her site, customers can send links or screenshots of things they want from any co.uk website. Customer service is handled via Messenger and her Facebook page, and Akhter guarantees delivery within two weeks.</p>



<p>The 34-year-old mother set up her Facebook store three months after the birth of her son in 2014 and has built a loyal following over the years. Akhter spends her mornings scouring the<em> </em>British websites of popular brands like The Body Shop, Superdrug, Clarks, and so on, hunting for flash sales or discounts. Once she finds a good deal, she shares the link on her Facebook group with screenshots: “3 hr left flash sale bodyshop 50%.” In June, orders totaled over $800. Akhter’s success is especially notable, as it’s uncommon to see a Bangladeshi woman running her own business. In many traditional South Asian households, women are discouraged from working after marriage.</p>



<p>The reason thousands of Bangladeshis depend on Akhter to do their shopping is that she has access to something very few of them do: a credit card, and an international one at that. “It’s my secret weapon,” Akhter said. To prevent money laundering, Bangladesh has issued roughly <a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/business/banking/credit-card-market-still-untapped-1452808">1.5 million</a> credit cards, and even those cards have a $300 transaction limit for international online purchases. This has created a boom in cross-border F-commerce and turned retail arbitrage into a thriving sector.</p>



<p>The rise of F-commerce has also inadvertently ushered in more-direct models of customer engagement, moving away from impersonal help pages and suggestion boxes.<strong> </strong>Qazi<strong> </strong>Fahimda Hasan, the 26-year-old founder of an F-commerce business that focuses on beauty and lifestyle products, has made this part of her brand’s identity. Through Facebook Messenger, she shares tips for identifying counterfeit products, such as checking for irregularities in packaging, spotting spelling errors, verifying barcodes, and so on. She also invested in a mini-photography studio to take professional photos and videos of her inventory. The pictures on her Facebook wall act as a real-time bulletin board for her click-and-order store. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Globally, the hottest new trend for online sellers is livestreaming. In China, consumers on Pinduoduo are using it to break into the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/e-commerce/article/3022929/chinas-social-e-commerce-sector-more-double-us185-billion-sales">$200 billion</a> market for impulse and everyday purchases. In the United States, Amazon has been experimenting with <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-live-launches-with-live-streamed-shopping-videos/">Amazon Live</a> Creator, which lets merchants set up streams to showcase their products. (So far, it seems to have had little success.) In Bangladesh, sellers go on Facebook Live to promote items, respond to questions, and take instant orders. Some products attract larger crowds than others. </p>



<p>“People simply go crazy for whitening creams,” said Akhter. “I mean, you could have 1,000 or 2,000 people watching a live demo on Facebook.” With little formal regulation, this is all based on trust. Many sellers aren’t concerned with looking glamorous or dressing up for the camera, and at first glance, their streams often come across as an ersatz version of the Home Shopping Network in the U.S.</p>

<p>Before the pandemic, a seller who goes by only Sulaiman would spend his evenings holding Facebook livestreams in front of multicolor <em>sarees</em> in his clothing shop, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/symbolfashionhouse/videos/2684482508481909/">Symbol Fashion House</a>, in Dhaka. Then, he was forced to change venues. In a twenty-minute stream from his living room, Sulaiman <a href="https://www.facebook.com/symbolfashionhouse/videos/">shows</a> off a variety of clothes on offer, explaining the decorative stones on a <em>salwar </em>and the embroidery on a fabric. “Each of our <em>chunni</em> prints cost 550 taka [6$]. Take a screenshot and inbox the picture if interested,” Sulaiman exhorts viewers. Throughout the livestream, buyers flood the chat, asking to see more colors and sizes. “We started doing Facebook Live only about six months ago,” Sulaiman told <em>Rest of World. </em>Since then, he has averaged about $4,500 a month in online orders.</p>



<p>F-commerce emerged in Bangladesh largely because there was no major e-commerce platform to absorb all the business. But although it’s biggest there, this form of selling isn’t exclusive to the country, or even the region: globally, 160 million small stores operate on Facebook, and in countries like Thailand, almost <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Thais-embrace-shopping-via-social-media">half of all online sales</a> happen through social media. Recently, platforms have started to accommodate them. Earlier this year, Facebook introduced <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/introducing-facebook-shops/">features</a> allowing sellers to customize their online shops and made it easier for them to catalogue their goods and process payments.</p>



<p>The rise of F-commerce is, of course, inextricable from Facebook. As whole sections of Bangladeshi society get online for the first time, many consider “being on the internet” as simply having registered on Facebook. According to one estimate, the social media giant had nearly <a href="https://napoleoncat.com/stats/facebook-users-in-bangladesh/2020/05">39 million</a> active users in Bangladesh in May<sub> </sub>—&nbsp;23.8% of the population. This widespread use has meant that F-commerce has expanded beyond cities like Dhaka, Chittagong, and Sylhet and pulled new kinds of consumers into online shopping.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“If Amazon were to enter, they could wipe out the market.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It’s also changed other dynamics. While Bangladeshi F-commerce shops relied on snail mail until just a few years ago, many sellers have hired logistics firms to carry out their quality checks, packaging, and delivery services, as they’ve expanded their businesses. Apart from transporting goods, logistics firms such as <a href="http://ecourierz.com/">eCourierz</a>, <a href="http://shopup.com.bd/">ShopUp</a>, …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Principal components analysis (PCA) is one of a family of techniques for taking high-dimensional data, and using the dependencies between the variables to represent it in a more tractable, lower-dimensional form, without losing too much information. It has been widely used for data compression and de-noising. However, its entire mathematical process is sometimes ambiguous to the user.</p>



<p>In this article, I would like to discuss the entire process of PCA mathematically, including PCA projection and reconstruction, with most of the derivations and proofs provided. At the end of the article, I implemented PCA projection and reconstruction from scratch. After reading this article, there should be no more black box in PCA anymore.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="orthogonal-matrix">Orthogonal Matrix</h4>

<p>In linear algebra, an orthogonal matrix is a real square matrix whose columns and rows are orthogonal unit vectors (orthonormal vectors).</p>



<p>Equivalently, the mathematical expression is</p>



<p>By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix">the definition of invertible matrix</a>, this means matrix $A$ is invertible and $A^{-1} = A^{\top}$.</p>



<p>We could also view this from the perspective of determinant.</p>



<p>Because $A$ and $A^{\top}$ are square matrices and using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant#Properties_of_the_determinant">the properties of determinant</a></p>



<p>Since $\det(A) \neq 0$, matrix $A$ is invertible. We multiply $A^{-1}$ on both side of the orthogonal matrix definition.</p>



<p>We have also derived the conclusion that $A^{-1} = A^{\top}$.</p>



<p>Similarly, a complex square matrix $A$ is unitary if its transpose conjugate $A^{\dagger}$ is also its inverse.</p>



<p>Equivalently, the mathematical expression is</p>



<h4 id="symmetric-matrix">Symmetric Matrix</h4>

<p>Real symmetric matrix has the following useful properties:</p>



<p>If $A$ is a real symmetric matrix, all of its eigenvalues are real numbers.</p>



<p>Because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate#Generalizations">the conjugate properties</a> and $\overline{A} = A$ since $A$ is a real value matrix,</p>



<p>We got $A \overline{v} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{v}$.</p>



<p>Let $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ be an eigenvalue of the symmetric matrix $A$. $Av = \lambda v$ and $v \neq 0$. We multiply $v^{\dagger}$ ($v^{\dagger} = \overline{v}^{\top}$) to the both sides, and because of $A^{\top} = A$ and the property we have just derived $A \overline{v} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{v}$,</p>



<p>We have $\lambda v^{\dagger} v = \overline{\lambda} v^{\dagger} v$, thus $\lambda$ is real.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="positive-semi-definite-matrix">Positive Semi-Definite Matrix</h4>

<p>The $n \times n$ symmetric matrix $A$ is defined to be positive semi-definite, if $x^{\dagger} A x \geq 0$ for $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$.</p>



<p>The positive semi-definite matrix has the following important property:</p>



<p>The eigenvalues of positive semi-definite matrix are non-negative.</p>



<p>Because $x^{\dagger} A x \geq$ for $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$, suppose $x$ is an eigenvector of $A$ and $Ax = \lambda x$ where $x \neq 0$,</p>



<p>Because $x^{\dagger} x$ must be real number and $x^{\dagger} x &gt; 0$, we have $\lambda \geq 0$.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="covariance-matrix">Covariance Matrix</h4>

<p>The covariance matrix has the following important property:</p>



<p>Covariance matrix is positive semi-definite. This means that the eigenvalues of covariance matrix is non-negative.</p>



<p>The proof of that covariance must be positive semi-definite could be found in my previous post on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Multivariate-Gaussian-Covariance-Matrix/">Multivariate Gaussian and Covariance Matrix</a>.</p>

<h4 id="singular-values">Singular Values</h4>

<p>The singular values, $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2$, $\cdots$, $\sigma_r$, of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ are the square roots, $\sigma_i = \sqrt{\lambda_i}$, of non-negative eigenvalues of the associated Gram matrix $K = A^{\dagger}A$. The corresponding eigenvectors of $K$ are known as singular vectors of $A$.</p>



<p>Note that the associated Gram matrix $K = A^{\dagger}A$ is real and symmetric, so the eigenvalues of $K$ are all real.</p>



<p>$K = A^{\dagger}A$ is also positive semi-definite.</p>



<p>For any vector $x$</p>



<p>Because $Ax$ is also a vector,</p>



<p>Therefore, all the eigenvalues of $K = A^{\dagger}A$ are non-negative and they all have a corresponded singular value of $A$.</p>

<h4 id="singular-value-decomposition">Singular Value Decomposition</h4>

<p>In linear algebra, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix that generalizes the eigendecomposition of a square normal matrix to any $ m\times n$ matrix via an extension of the polar decomposition.</p>



<p>Specifically, the singular value decomposition of an $m \times n$ real or complex matrix $M$ is a factorization of the form $U \Sigma V^{\dagger}$, where $U$ is an $m \times m$ real or complex unitary matrix, $\Sigma$ is a $m \times n$ rectangular diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal, and $V$ is an $n \times n$ real or complex unitary matrix.</p>



<p>The diagonal entries $\sigma_{i}=\Sigma_{ii}$ of $\Sigma$ are known as the singular values of $M$. The number of non-zero singular values is equal to the rank of $M$.</p>



<p>In particular, for any matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}$,</p>



<p>We will skip the proof for why every matrix has SVD and the algorithm for SVD.</p>

<h4 id="singular-value-decomposition-for-norm-matrix">Singular Value Decomposition for Norm Matrix</h4>

<p>For any matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}$, $A^{\dagger} A$ could be expressed as</p>



<p>We multiply $V$ at both side of the equation.</p>



<p>Note that $\Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma$ is a square diagonal matrix. Based on the definition of eigenvalue and eigenvectors, the diagonal values of $\Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma$, including the zeros, are the eigenvalues of $A^{\dagger} A$. All the columns of $V$ are the corresponding eigenvectors of $A^{\dagger} A$.</p>



<p>Similarly, $A A^{\dagger}$ could be expressed as</p>



<p>Note that $\Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger}$ is a square diagonal matrix. Based on the definition of eigenvalue and eigenvectors, the diagonal values of $\Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger}$, including the zeros, are the eigenvalues of $A A^{\dagger}$. All the columns of $U$ are the corresponding eigenvectors of $A A^{\dagger}$.</p>

<h3 id="mathematics-of-principal-components-analysis">Mathematics of Principal Components Analysis</h3>

<p>We start with $p$-dimensional vectors, and want to summarize them by projecting down into a $q$-dimensional subspace, where $q \leq p$. Our summary will be the projection of the original vectors on to $q$ directions, the principal axes, which span the subspace.</p>

<h4 id="minimizing-projection-residuals">Minimizing Projection Residuals</h4>

<p>Given a dataset $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ whose row is the centered data vectors $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$ for $0 \leq i \leq n-1$ ($\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_{i} = 0$), if we have a unit vector $w \in \mathbb{R}^p$ ($|w| = 1$) and we project the all the data vectors to this unit vector $w$.</p>



<p>The length of projection for data vector $x_i$ on $w$, by definition, is</p>



<p>where $\langle x_i, w \rangle$ is the inner product of $x_i$ and $w$.</p>



<p>The projection vector for data vector $x_i$ on $w$ is $\langle x_i, w \rangle w$.</p>



<p>The residual, which is the distance from data vector $x_i$ to $w$, is the length of vector $x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w$.</p>



<p>Let’s check what the residual square $| x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w | ^2$ is.</p>



<p>The optimization goal of projection is to minimize mean squared error $\text{MSE}(w)$, which is the mean of the residual sum of squares.</p>



<p>Remember the relationship between variance and expected value, $\mathbb{V}(X) = \mathbb{E}(X^2) - \mathbb{E}(X)^2$, we have</p>



<p>So $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}  \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2$ is actually the variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector $\mathbb{V}\big(\langle x, w \rangle\big)$.</p>



<p>We further have another expression of $\text{MSE}(w)$.</p>



<p>Because $\mathbb{E}\big(\langle x, x \rangle\big)$ is not dependent on $w$, minimizing the mean of the residual sum of squares $\text{MSE}(w)$ turns out to be equivalent to maximizing the variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector.</p>



<p>The variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector could also be expressed using the dataset matrix $X$.</p>



<p>where $\frac{X^{\top} X}{n}$ is the covariance matrix of $X$.</p>



<p>If we project the data vectors to $q$ orthogonal unit vectors $w_0$, $w_1$, $\cdots$, $w_{q-1}$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times q}$. Then our optimization goal becomes maximizing the residual sum of squares on all these projection vectors.</p>



<p>subject to</p>



<h4 id="maximizing-variance">Maximizing Variance</h4>

<p>Suppose we are projecting the data to $p$ orthonormal unit vectors $w \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}$, and $W$ is a orthonormal matrix.</p>



<p>subject to</p>



<p>Let’s try to maximize one $\mathscr{L}(w) = w^{\top} X^{\top} X w$ first, and the constrain is $w^{\top} w = 1$. We would use Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ to help us solve the optimization problem.</p>





<p>We set $\frac{\partial \mathscr{L}}{\lambda} = 0$ and $\frac{\partial \mathscr{L}}{w} = 0$, we get</p>



<p>So by definition, $\lambda$ and $w$ are the eigenvalue and eigenvector of matrix $X^{\top} X$.</p>



<p>Because $X^{\top} X$ is real symmetric matrix and positive semi-definite, all the eigenvalues of $X^{\top} X$ are non-negative.</p>



<p>$X^{\top} X$ has exact $p$ eigenvalues $\lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_{p-1}$ and their corresponding eigenvectors $w_0, w_1, \cdots, w_{p-1}$. The matrix $W$, which consists of the eigenvectors $w_0, w_1, \cdots, w_{p-1}$, happens to be the global maximum solution for $\mathscr{L}(W)$. The global maximum value for $\mathscr{L}(W)$ is the sum of non-negative eigenvalues.</p>



<p>Because these eigenvalues are non-negative, and their contribution to the global maximum could be sorted by their values.</p>



<p>We call the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue the first principal axis, the eigenvector corresponding to the second largest eigenvalue the second principal axis, and so on.</p>



<p>Suppose we are projecting the data to $q$ orthonormal unit vectors $w \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$, and $q \leq p$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times q}$. The optimization problem becomes maximizing the following equation.</p>



<p>subject to</p>



<p>However, the solution is obvious. We just have to pick the $q$ largest eigenvalues and their …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I'd done everything right, yet it was 2 am and I still couldn't sleep. I had meditated for 30 minutes before I went to bed. I even took a couple of melatonin pills right after to be sure. Yet, here I was wide awake dreading how exhausted I would be the next day at work.</p><p>My problem wasn't unique. In America, one in every 10 adults will experience chronic insomnia<sup><a href="#references">1</a></sup>. It takes just one poor night of sleep to devolve into long term sleeping problems. This is because the majority of sleeping problems stem from anxiety and worry<sup><a href="#references">2</a></sup>. <b>The more you worry about not getting enough sleep, the worse your sleep gets</b>.</p><p>For me, my sleeping issues began right out of college. I had started a job as a software engineer and I was starting to feel the pressure. I had a couple of big deadlines coming up and I found myself tossing and turning unable to sleep one night. My mind kept racing, thinking about all the work I had until I finally fell asleep.</p><p>I thought that was it — an abnormal night, but then it happened again. This time, my outlook changed. I started worrying about how not getting enough sleep would affect my day. I looked up basic sleep hygiene tips online and decided to go to bed extra early to make sure I made up for lost sleep. This ended up backfiring and it took a few hours before I could finally sleep.</p><p>At this point, my sleeping struggles started becoming more regular. I downloaded a couple of meditation apps in the hopes that meditating and listening to soothing sounds would help me sleep better. I even resorted to over the counter sleeping aids on nights when it took me too long to fall asleep. <b>The results were mixed — I'd fall asleep faster but over time I'd revert back to having poor sleep</b>.</p><p>I finally caved and decided to try prescription medication. I had read a lot about them and was very reluctant because of their long term side effects. On a visit to my doctor, I asked her if she could prescribe me something to help me sleep. She said she said she could, but it wasn't going to be medication. Instead, she put in a referral to a CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia) therapist.</p><p>CBT-I is an evidence-based (proven in clinical trials) technique used to treat sleep problems<sup><a href="#references">3</a></sup>. <b>Two driving forces induce sleep — sleep drive &amp; mental arousal</b>. Your sleep drive is how sleepy/tired you feel when going to bed. Your mental arousal is the racing thoughts and alertness you feel when you go to bed. When your sleep drive is high and your arousal levels are low; it is easier to fall asleep. CBT-I prescribes a sleep schedule that ensures you have a high sleep drive. It also teaches you techniques to worry less and reduce your arousal.</p><p><b>CBT-I is extremely effective in treating sleeping problems</b>. Clinical trials have shown that 80% of people that follow a good CBT-I program will have normal sleep by the end<sup><a href="#references">4</a></sup>. The results are also permanent, unlike sleeping aids which are effective only as long as you are taking them<sup><a href="#references">5</a></sup>.</p><p>There were three main rules that I had to follow -</p><ol><li><p>I could only sleep within the sleep window my therapist prescribed. This ensured that I only went to bed when my sleep drive was high.</p></li><li><p>Every time I couldn't sleep, I had to make sure I didn't stay in bed for over 20 minutes. This way, I would subconsciously re-train my mind to not associate my bed with wakefulness<sup><a href="#references">6</a></sup>.</p></li><li><p>No day time naps and no caffeine after 2pm.</p></li></ol><div><p>I was sleeping around 5 hours at the time, so we set a 6 hour window within which I could sleep (1am - 7am in my case). I kept a log of how long it took me to sleep, how long I was awake in the middle of the night and how long I slept. This data was recorded to the closest 15th minute and is self reported. At the end of each week, my therapist would alter my sleep schedule based on the previous week's data.<b> Note:</b> Time awake is the time it took me to fall asleep + my night time awakenings
</p></div><p>
At the end of week 1, I was sleeping about the same as I was before. My time awake at night though had fallen by an hour. I was falling asleep faster and I was having less interrupted sleep. We decided to stick to the same sleep schedule for week 2.
</p><p>
At the end of this week, my sleep had increased and I was consistently awake for less than an hour. We decided to expand my window by 15 minutes for week 3.
</p><p>
We followed the same rules and either expanded or kept the same sleeping window for the next few weeks.
</p><p><b>At the end of the 10 week program, I was sleeping over 7 hours a night</b>. More importantly, I wasn't spending my days worrying about my sleep.
</p><p><b>CBT-I isn't an easy solution</b>. The sleep schedules are hard to follow and the results aren't instantaneous. It takes time and effort but the reward of permanently improved sleep is well worth it. Let me know if you do decide to try it and if it helps you improve your sleep. Here's to hoping you get better sleep soon.</p><p>If you'd like to know more about CBTI and other behavioral therapy techniques to improve sleep, check out our <a href="https://www.sleepedy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">website</a>!</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><ol><li><p><a href="http://sleepeducation.org/news/2014/03/10/insomnia-awareness-day-facts-and-stats" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Insomnia Awareness Day by the American Association of Sleep Medicine</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/related-illnesses/sleep-disorders" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sleep Disorders by the Anxiety and Depression Association of America</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.sleepedy.com/cbt-for-insomnia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CBT for Insomnia: A comprehensive guide</a></p></li><li><p>Trauer, James M. et al. “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26054060" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Insomnia: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.</a> Ann Intern Med.

<p>Medium’s most significant selling points are how easy it is to publish your thoughts and the social aspect of the platform.</p>



<p>However, with ease, comes restrictions.</p>



<p>In this post, I’ll discuss how Medium has burned me in the past and why I don’t think it’s the right place for your stories on the web.</p>



<p>Let’s start with:</p>



<h2>My experience with Medium</h2>



<p>When Medium was new, I jumped into the bandwagon, and called it the home for my blog posts for quite some time.</p>



<p>I was happy with the experience. The editor was beautiful, and the presence of community made the platform a suitable place to publish my thoughts, and reach people quickly.</p>



<p>After writing solo for some time, I got accepted to write for a couple of Medium publications like <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://medium.com/swlh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Startup</a>, freeCodeCamp, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hacker Noon</a>, and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://byrslf.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Be Yourself</a>.</p>



<p>I thought my blog hosting days were behind me. Medium was going to be my one-stop blogging destination.</p>



<p>But then, came the hammer:</p>



<p>Medium’s content moderation algorithm blocked my profile by mistake without a notice.</p>



<p>I didn’t even realise that my Medium profile wasn’t visible to anyone but me. I assumed since I haven’t written for some time, my views started dropping naturally.</p>



<p>It was until I tried sharing my profile link with a friend did I notice that my profile page returned a 404 error like this:</p>

<p>After contacting Medium Support on Twitter, they unblocked my profile with a reply that my account was flagged mistakenly.</p>



<p>Check this reply from Medium Support:</p>

<p>What’s crazy?</p>



<p>Neither you nor I can stop this from happening again because Medium is a rented land for us.</p>



<p>On the web:</p>



<h2>It’s always better to own your platform</h2>



<p>This advice is accurate for any form of content, be it blog posts or a video.</p>



<p>Until you host your content on your platform, they will always live at the mercy of the company hosting the platform.</p>



<p>I was not the only case where Medium’s algorithm went haywire; it happened with other people as well:</p>

<p>And this is true for other content platforms like YouTube. There had been cases where YouTube videos with tons of views disappeared overnight.</p>

<p>Even though Medium reinstated my profile, I stopped publishing on the platform and moved to my blog again.</p>



<p>You might be thinking:</p>



<h2>What about the virality that comes from Medium’s community?</h2>



<p>It’s true. Medium has a good community. And, if your content catches fire, it will be viral.</p>



<p>However, that’s not always the case. I have had very few organic traffic from Medium.</p>



<p>Most of my articles had traffic from external sources. Here are some stats for you:</p>

<p>Even if you manage to score a good amount of traffic on your content on Medium, it’s wise to use this opportunity to build an initial traction for your blog.</p>



<p>A lot of companies like <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Basecamp</a> and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Spotify</a> executed this idea with their company blogs.</p>



<p>They started with a Medium publication, and when they gained traction on their content, they moved to their own hosted blogs.</p>



<p>Coincidentally:</p>



<p>I was listening to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1370USFCRZJnv2BXc631pq" rel="noreferrer noopener">a podcast episode</a>&nbsp;a few days back where a YouTuber said that he is building his platform to prevent his content from being taken down by YouTube.</p>



<p>That said:</p>



<h2>Medium is still suitable for some cases</h2>



<p>There are situations when Medium is the best choice for writers. Some of them are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Blogging casually. </strong>When you’re just jotting your thoughts down and don’t care about your brand, Medium can be a right fit for those occasional brain dumps.</li><li><strong>Not being able to afford hosting fees.</strong> Hosting your blog costs money, whereas Medium is free.</li><li><strong>Quick money.</strong> Earning money from your blog takes time. On Medium, however, you can put your story behind a paywall and make money from <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011694187-Join-the-Partner-Program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Medium’s Partner Program</a>.</li></ul>



<p>However, if you’re serious about blogging, you should always focus on your own blog.</p>



<p>Apart from the freedom to publish anything you want, you’ll also get unlimited branding and customisation options on your blog.</p>



<p>Medium allows only a handful of customisations for publications and little to nothing for the article content.</p>



<p>Even the everyday use cases like syntax highlighting requires jumping through multiple hoops to make it possible.</p>



<p>Also, Medium <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003053487-Custom-Domains-service-deprecation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stopped allowing custom domains</a> for publications starting <strong>November, 2017</strong>. That means, your publication will have an URL structure like this:</p>



<p><mark>medium.com/yourpublication</mark></p>



<p>There’s, however, one approach where you can make Medium work for you with acceptable side-effects.</p>



<p>How?</p>



<h2>Mirror your blog on Medium</h2>



<p>This technique isn’t something I invented. I have seen a lot of established authors like <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://dariusforoux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Darius Foroux</a> do this regularly and I tried it on my own as well.</p>



<p>The concept is to publish first on your own blog and then later republish the same content on Medium.</p>



<p>You can either create a publication on Medium for reposting or publish under your profile.</p>



<p>And at the end of each article, add a byline which links to the original article on your site.</p>



<p>The benefit of this approach is that while your content is safely resting on your blog, you can leverage Medium and get more eyeballs for your writing.</p>



<p>However, there’s a catch, SEO-wise.</p>



<p>Since Medium has a high domain authority on Google Search, your articles on Medium might outrank the same articles published on your blog.</p>



<p>Also, Google might add negative signals for your website, thinking that you copy-pasted an article from Medium on your blog.</p>



<p>Tread carefully.</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> As pointed out in the comments section, Medium has an&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank" href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214550207-Import-a-post" rel="noreferrer noopener">import tool</a>&nbsp;which allows you to add a canonical link from your Medium post to your original blog post. </p>



<p>This process ensures that Google does not think of your blog post as a duplicate. Thanks to Nicolas and Matthias for this correction.&nbsp;🥂</p>



<h2>Tell me about your strategy</h2>



<p>Now that you know the disadvantages of blogging on Medium, what do you think?</p>



<p>Will you be <a href="https://hulry.com/back-to-wordpress/">moving your blog</a> from Medium? Or vice-versa?</p>



<p>Have you already moved from Medium? Love to hear that story too.</p>

      <h2 id="hive-and-presto">Hive and Presto</h2>
<p>Hive and Presto have developed a tortoise-and-hare story over the past 8 years.
Initially conceived at Facebook and open sourced in August 2008,
Hive was hailed as a breakthrough in the SQL-on-Hadoop technology
and generally regarded as the de facto standard.
Then in 2012,
Facebook started to develop Presto as a replacement of Hive,
which was considered too slow for their daily workload.
As Facebook was specific about its goal in developing Presto,
the future of Hive did not look so bright.</p>
<p>The activity in the Hive community, however, did not dwindle at all.
In February 2013,
the Hive community, spearheaded by Hortonworks, embarked on the Stinger Initiative with the aim of achieving 100x performance improvement.
The outcome of the Stinger Initiative was impressive.
The integration of a new execution engine Tez eliminated the most costly overhead in its original execution engine MapReduce,
and the introduction of LLAP (Low Latency Analytical Processing) brought the performance to the next level.
The in-memory cache implemented in LLAP was also a timely response to the separation of compute and storage.</p>
<p>Eventually Hive has come to outperform Presto by a large margin.
The following graph summarizes the result of evaluating Hive 3.1.2 and Presto 317 on the TPC-DS benchmark with a scale factor of 10 terabytes
(with details in our <a href="https://www.datamonad.com/2019-08-22-comparison-presto317-0.10/">previous article</a>).
In the experiment, we use Hive on MR3 which is comparable to Hive-LLAP in performance.
We observe that with respect to the geometric mean of running times,
<strong>Hive runs three times faster than Presto: 30.83 seconds for Hive vs 90.07 seconds for Presto.</strong>
This is no easy feat from a technical perspective, especially because Hive supports fault tolerance whereas Presto does not.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.datamonad.com/img/mr3.0.10/presto.hive.time.new.wide-fs8.png" alt="presto.hive.time.new.wide"></p>
<h2 id="why-choose-presto-over-hive">Why choose Presto over Hive?</h2>
<p>Nevertheless Presto has its own strengths
and is <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking_trend/system/Presto">rising rapidly in popularity</a> (as of July 2020).
Interestingly its speed is one of its selling points
as many industrial users are still under the mistaken impression that Presto is much faster than Hive.
For our purpose,
we focus on the following core strength of Presto among others – easy installation.</p>
<p>Presto is easy to install.
It suffices to copy the binary distribution of Presto in the installation directory on every node,
whether in a Hadoop cluster or not.
In order to run Presto,
the user configures the installation as either a coordinator or a worker and executes a common script on each node.
After starting a coordinator, the user can launch workers in any order,
which implies that it is also straightforward to add new workers later.
The ease and simplicity of the installation process is achievable because Presto has relatively few dependencies.</p>
<p>This strength of Presto, however, really shines in an environment where Docker containers are supported, most notably on Kubernetes.
A Docker image can be easily built from the binary distribution of Presto,
and after creating a Docker container for a coordinator, the user can create or delete as many Docker containers for workers as necessary.
In essence, running Presto with Docker containers is no different from running it directly with the binary distribution.</p>
<p>In stark contrast, installing Hive is a daunting task.
First of all, the user should find a Hadoop cluster compatible with Hive to be installed.
For example, in order to install Hive 3, the user should either upgrade an existing cluster to Hadoop 3 or create a new Hadoop 3 cluster.
Then the user should install a compatible version of Tez.
Finally the user should check other dependencies, such as ZooKeeper, in order to use advanced features of Hive such as LLAP.
The difficulty and complexity of the installation process is inevitable because Hive has relatively many dependencies, including Hadoop itself.</p>
<p>‘‘Easy installation’’ is a distinctive feature of Presto that is certainly helping to accelerate its adoption, especially in the cloud environment.
In comparison, Hive is struggling even in the Hadoop environment.
It is not uncommon to see potential users switching to Presto
just at the thought of having to upgrade the Hadoop cluster or after failing to configure LLAP properly.
Perhaps not by coincidence,
<strong>Hive is now <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking_trend/system/Hive">gradually losing its popularity after its peak in December 2019</a></strong> (as of July 2020).</p>
<h2 id="hive-on-mr3----a-new-alternative">Hive on MR3 – a new alternative</h2>
<p>Hive on MR3 has been developed with the goal of facilitating the use of Hive, both on Hadoop and on Kubernetes, by exploiting a new execution engine MR3.
As such, Hive on MR3 is much easier to install than the original Hive.
On Hadoop, it suffices to copy the binary distribution in the installation directory on the master node.
On Kubernetes,
the user can build a Docker image from the binary distribution (or use a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/mr3project">pre-built image</a>)
and clone the <a href="https://github.com/mr3project/mr3-run-k8s">GitHub repository</a> containing all the scripts.</p>
<p>Hive on MR3 not only retains all the strengths of Hive, but also supports additional features unique to MR3.
For example,
<a href="https://mr3docs.datamonad.com/docs/mr3/features/fault-tolerance/">fault tolerance</a> is more mature than in Tez and Spark,
<a href="https://mr3docs.datamonad.com/docs/mr3/features/autoscaling/">autoscaling</a> is assisted by MR3 itself (rather than relying on an external monitor),
and multiple shuffle handlers can run inside a single container so as to <a href="https://mr3docs.datamonad.com/docs/mr3/features/fetchdelay/">eliminate fetch delays</a>.
As it is agnostic to the underlying file system, Hive on MR3 fully supports the separation of compute and storage.</p>
<p>Now suppose that a new user wants to try Hive on MR3 in a Hadoop cluster.
The reader may well think that it is a no-brainer to choose Hive on MR3 on Hadoop.
<strong>We, however, recommend Hadoop on MR3 on Kubernetes, even in a Hadoop cluster.</strong>
Below we explain why.</p>
<h2 id="hive-on-mr3-on-kubernetes-running-in-a-hadoop-cluster">Hive on MR3 on Kubernetes running in a Hadoop cluster</h2>
<p>While it generally runs stable in a typical Hadoop cluster,
Hive on MR3 on Hadoop may run into subtle problems due to conflicting configurations.
Here are a few examples of such problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kerberos authentication does not work well because an old version of Java with no support for the unlimited cryptography policy is installed.</li>
<li>High availability does not work because an incompatible version of ZooKeeper is running.</li>
<li>The user cannot install Ranger (for managing data security) dedicated to Hive on MR3 because an old version of Ranger is already running.</li>
<li>It is not easy to run multiple instances of HiveServer2 each with its own security policy.</li>
<li>On Cloudera CDH, the user should use MR3 based on Hadoop 2.7 in order to run Hive 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>By running Hive on MR3 on Kubernetes,
all such problems either disappear completely or are alleviated considerably.
The reason is two-fold: 1) all components now run in a containerized environment and thus the user controls everything;
2) the use of Kubernetes eliminates the need for advanced features specific to Hadoop such as high availability.
Moreover Hive on MR3 on Kubernetes is easier to operate than Hive on MR3 on Hadoop.
For example, it is easy to run multiple instances of HiveServer2 each with its own security policy while sharing all the resources.</p>
<p>Running Hive on MR3 on Kubernetes in a Hadoop cluster, however, may have two new problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Kubernetes may conflict with Hadoop.</li>
<li>Hive on MR3 on Kubernetes may run slower than Hive on MR3 on Hadoop.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the first problem,
Kubernetes and Hadoop can coexist in the same cluster
because Kubernetes (written in Go) and Hadoop (written in Java) share practically no dependencies.
(After installing Kubernetes in a Hadoop cluster, the user can stop Yarn which is no longer needed.)
For the second problem, <strong>the performance penalty does exist because of the use of Docker containers,
but is acceptable with the release of MR3 1.1.</strong></p>
<h2 id="experimental-results">Experimental results</h2>
<p>To measure the performance penalty inherent in Kubernetes,
we run an experiment with the following settings (where we use both Hive 3 and Hive 4):</p>
<ul>
<li>A cluster of 42 nodes each with 24 cores, 96 gigabytes of memory, and 6 HDDs</li>
<li>10 gigabit network switch</li>

<p>Here is the summary (all measurements in seconds):</p>

<p>We make the following observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>With respect to the total running time,
<ul>
<li>Hive 3 on MR3 on Kubernetes is 12.8 percent slower than on Hadoop.</li>
<li>Hive 4 on MR3 on Kubernetes is 18.4 percent slower than on Hadoop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>With respect to the geometric mean of running times,
<ul>
<li>Hive 3 on MR3 on Kubernetes is 7.8 percent slower than on Hadoop.</li>
<li>Hive 4 on MR3 on Kubernetes is 1.0 percent slower than on Hadoop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We claim that the performance penalty is in an acceptable range and does not outweigh the benefit conferred by Kubernetes.
The following graphs show that end users are not very likely to notice the difference in performance.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.datamonad.com/img/mr3.1.1/hive3.hadoop.vs.k8s-fs8.png" alt="hive3.hadoop.vs.k8s">
<img src="https://www.datamonad.com/img/mr3.1.1/hive4.hadoop.vs.k8s-fs8.png" alt="hive4.hadoop.vs.k8s"></p>
<p>As a side note, we find that Hive 4 runs noticeably faster than Hive 3 on average,
and that Hive 3 and Hive 4 differ in the result of query 18 and query 22.</p>
<p>Thus the bottomline is:
<strong>if you are new to Hive, try Hive on MR3;
if you are new to Hive on MR3, try Hive on MR3 on Kubernetes, whether in a Hadoop cluster or not.</strong></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I have been working in the BI/Analytics field for a long time and have seen a lot of disruptive technologies in this space going through the hype cycle. Moving from SMP technologies to MPP databases, the era of Hadoop, the meteoric rise of Python and R for data science, serverless architectures and data lakes on cloud platforms etc. ensured that this industry stays more vibrant than ever. I see new frameworks, tools and paradigms raising to the surface almost daily and there are always new things to learn and explore. A few weeks ago, I had an interesting conversation with a recruiter about what’s trendy and interesting in the space of BI and Analytics and what the businesses she’s been helping with resourcing are looking for in terms of the IT talent pool. I was expecting to hear things like AI PaaS, Synthetic Data, Edge Analytics and all the interesting (and over-hyped) stuff that the cool kids in Silicon Valley are getting into. Instead, she asserted that apart from public cloud platforms and all the run-of-the-mill BI tools like PowerBI and Looker, there is a growing demand for Snowflake projects. Mind you, this is an Australian market so chances are your neck of the woods may look completely different, but suffice to say, I didn’t expect a company not affiliated with a major public cloud provider to become so popular, particularly in this already congested market for cloud data warehousing solutions.</p>
<p>Snowflake, a direct competitor to Amazon’s Redshift, Microsoft’s Synapse and Google’s BigQuery, has been around for some time, but only recently I also started hearing more about it becoming the go-to technology for storing and processing large volumes of data in the cloud. I was also surprised to see Snowflake positioned in the ‘Leaders’ quadrant in the Data Management Solutions for Analytics chart, dethroning the well-known and respected industry stalwarts such as Vertica or Greenplum.</p>

<p>In this post, I want to look at Snowflake performance characteristics by creating a TPC-DS benchmark schema and executing a few analytical queries to see how it fares in comparison to some of the other MPP databases I worked with and/or tested. It’s not supposed to be an exhaustive overview or test and as such, these benchmark results should not be taken as Gospel. Having worked with databases all my career, I always look forward to exploring new technologies and even though I don’t expect to utilise Snowflake in my current project, it’s always exciting to kick the tires on a new platform or service.</p>
<p>OK, let’s dive in and see what’s in store!</p>
<h3>Snowflake Architecture Primer</h3>
<p>Snowflake claims to be built for cloud from the ground-up and does not offer on-premise deployment option, it’s a purely data warehouse as a service (DWaaS) offering. Everything – from database storage infrastructure to the compute resources used for analysis and optimisation of data – is handled by Snowflake. In this respect, Snowflake is not that much different from Google’s BigQuery although it’s difficult to contrast those two, mainly due to different pricing models (excluding storage cost) – BigQuery charges per volume of data scanned whereas Snowflake went with a more traditional model i.e. compute size and resource time allocation.</p>
<p>Snowflake’s architecture is a hybrid of traditional shared-disk database architectures and shared-nothing database architectures. Similar to shared-disk architectures, Snowflake uses a central data repository for persisted data that is accessible from all compute nodes in the data warehouse. But just like shared-nothing architectures, Snowflake processes queries using massively parallel processing compute clusters, where each node in the cluster stores a portion of the entire data set locally. This approach offers the data management simplicity of a shared-disk architecture, but with the performance and scale-out benefits of a shared-nothing architecture.</p>
<p>Snowflake’s unique architecture consists of three key layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Database Storage – When data is loaded into Snowflake, Snowflake reorganizes that data into its internaly optimized, compressed, columnar format. Snowflake stores this optimized data in cloud storage. Snowflake manages all aspects of how this data is stored — the organization, file size, structure, compression, metadata, statistics, and other aspects of data storage are handled by Snowflake. The data objects stored by Snowflake are not directly visible nor accessible by customers; they are only accessible through SQL query operations run using Snowflake</li>
<li>Query Processing – Query execution is performed in the processing layer. Snowflake processes queries using “virtual warehouses”. Each virtual warehouse is an MPP compute cluster composed of multiple compute nodes allocated by Snowflake from a cloud provider. Each virtual warehouse is an independent compute cluster that does not share compute resources with other virtual warehouses. As a result, each virtual warehouse has no impact on the performance of other virtual warehouses</li>
<li>Cloud Services – The cloud services layer is a collection of services that coordinate activities across Snowflake. These services tie together all of the different components of Snowflake in order to process user requests, from login to query dispatch. The cloud services layer also runs on compute instances provisioned by Snowflake from the cloud provider</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://bicortex.com/bicortex/wp-content/post_content//2020/07/Snowflake_Architecture_High_Level.png"><img src="http://bicortex.com/bicortex/wp-content/post_content//2020/07/Snowflake_Architecture_High_Level.png" alt="" width="580" height="334" srcset="http://bicortex.com/bicortex/wp-content/post_content/2020/07/Snowflake_Architecture_High_Level.png 765w, http://bicortex.com/bicortex/wp-content/post_content/2020/07/Snowflake_Architecture_High_Level-300x173.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"></a></p>
<p>Additionally, Snowflake can be hosted on any of the top three public cloud provides i.e. Azure, AWS and GCP across different regions, baring in mind that Snowflake accounts do not support multi-region deployments.</p>
<h3>Loading TPC-DS Data</h3>
<p>Data can be loaded into Snowflake is a number of ways, for example, using established ETL/ELT tools, using Snowpipe for continuous loading, WebUI or SnowSQL, and in a variety of formats e.g. JSON, AVRO, Parquet, CSV, Avro or XML. There are a few things to keep in mind when loading data into Snowflake which relate to file size, file splitting, file staging etc. The general recommendation is to produce files roughly 10MB to 100MB in size, compressed. Data loads of large Parquet files e.g. greater than 3GB could time out, therefore it is best practice to split those into smaller files to distribute the load among the servers in an active warehouse.</p>
<p>In order to run the TPC-DS queries on the Snowflake warehouse, I loaded the sample CSV-format data (scale factor of 100 and 300) from my local storage into the newly created schema using a small Python script. Snowflake also provides for staging files in public clouds object and blob storage e.g. AWS S3 but in this exercise, I transferred those from my local hard drive and staged them internally in Snowflake. As TPC-DS data does not conform to some of the requirements outlined above, the following script processed those files to ensure the format and size are consistent. The below script enables files’ format renaming (from DAT to CSV), breaking up larger files into smaller ones and removing trailing characters from line endings. It also creates the required TPC-DS schema and loads pre-processed data into its objects.</p>

Rose's <em>testimonia</em>&nbsp;of a work attributed to Aristotle called <em>Magic (</em>ὁ Μαγικός λόγος, or τὸ μαγικόν?). The title either refers to the art practised by the Magi (the Zoroastrian priests from Persia), or it refers to the fact that the discussion is a discussion about the Magi. The latter seems more likely, even though the first passage, from Diogenes Laertius, suggests the discussion mentioned all sorts of wisdom cults.</p><p>The attribution is disputed. Diogenes Laertius says it is by Aristotle, but doesn't put it in his list of Aristotle's works (it doesn't show up in any other list I've looked at in either Greek or Arabic). The Suda says it is by Antisthenes, and that some people attributed it to Aristotle or someone named Rhodon. It's not clear where the Suda is getting this from.</p><p>While we don't know who wrote it, its contents are hinted at by the testimonies gathered in Rose (+ a few others I've put together). Diogenes reports that Aristotle thought magic wasn't sorcery, but philosophy or wisdom. This is confirmed by the Suda. It has something to do with prognostication. Eudoxus, according to Pliny,&nbsp;believed it was useful and very valuable, and so it was not only practical but connected to more valuable objects of study, probably the heavenly bodies. This is especially supported by the etymology of Zoroaster ('star-diviner') reported by Diogenes,&nbsp;and Porphyry's etymology of 'magus' as 'wise in divine matters'. Philo specifies that it was a kind of 'optics'&nbsp;and a very precise branch of natural science. Finally, Philo, Porphyry and the Suda associate it with both wisdom <em>and </em>with kingship. Philo says not only private citizens practice magic, but that Persian kings themselves had to be educated as Magi to become king.</p><p>It seems to me as if all these testimonies could be referring to a discussion of wise philosopher kings who are able to predict the future through their understanding of the heavens and the science of nature.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1520798591087_18030"><div><p>"Some say the work of philosophy originated with the barbarians. For among the Persians are the Magi, among the Babylonians and Assyrians the Chaldeans, among the Indians the Gymnosophists (lit. naked philosophers), and among the Celts and Gauls, those called 'Druids' and holy people, according to what Aristotle says in the book on <em>Magic </em>and Sotion in the twenty-third book of the <em>Succession of Philosophers</em>."</p><p>Τὸ τῆς φιλοσοφίας ἔργον ἔνιοί φασιν ἀπὸ βαρβάρων ἄρξαι. γεγενῆσθαι γὰρ παρὰ μὲν Πέρσαις μάγους, παρὰ δὲ Βαβυλωνίοις ἢ Ἀσσυρίοις Χαλδαίους, καὶ γυμνοσοφιστὰς παρ' Ἰνδοῖς, παρά τε Κελτοῖς καὶ Γαλάταις τοὺς καλουμένους δρυίδας καὶ σεμνοθέους, καθά φησιν Ἀριστοτέλης ἐν τῷ μαγικῷ καὶ Σωτίων ἐν εἰκοστῷ τρίτῳ τῆς διαδοχῆς.</p><p><strong>Diogenes Laertius, <em>Lives of the Eminent Philosophers</em>, 1.1</strong></p><p>"The Magi were ignorant of sorcerers' magic, says Aristotle in the book on <em>Magic </em>and Dinon in the fifth book of his <em>Histories</em>. He also says 'Zoroaster' when translated literally means 'star-diviner'; Hermodorus says this as well. In the first book of <em>On Philosophy</em>, Aristotle says they (the Magi) are actually older than the Egyptians. And according to them there are two principles, a good daimon and a bad daimon: to the former, the name is Zeus and 'Oromasdes' [i.e., Ahura Mazda], to the other Hades and 'Arimanius' [i.e., Ahriman]. Hermippus says this too in the first book <em>On Magi</em>, so does Eudoxus in the <em>Survey</em>, and Theopompus in the eighth book of the <em>Philippics</em>."</p><p>Τὴν δὲ γοητικὴν μαγείαν [sc. οἱ Μάγοι] οὐδ' ἔγνωσαν, φησὶν Ἀριστοτέλης ἐν τῷ Μαγικῷ καὶ Δείνων ἐν τῇ πέμπτῃ τῶν Ἱστοριῶν· ὃς καὶ μεθερμηνευόμενόν φησι τὸν Ζωροάστρην ἀστροθύτην εἶναι· φησὶ δὲ τοῦτο καὶ ὁ Ἑρμόδωρος.

He was the son of a father with the same name, and his mother came from the people of Thrace. He wrote these ten volumes: first, <em>Magic</em>: it tells about a certain <em>magus</em>, Zoroaster, who discovered wisdom. Some people attribute this to Aristotle, others to Rhodon."</p><p>Ἀντισθένης, Ἀθηναῖος, ἀπὸ ῥητόρων φιλόσοφος Σωκρατικός, ὅστις Περιπατητικὸς ἐκλήθη πρῶτον, εἶτα ἐκύνισεν: υἱὸς δὲ ὢν ὁμωνύμου πατρὸς, μητρὸς δὲ τὸ γένος Θρᾴσσης. οὗτος συνέγραψε τόμους δέκα: πρῶτον μαγικόν: ἀφηγεῖται δὲ περὶ Ζωροάστρου τινὸς μάγου, εὑρόντος τὴν σοφίαν: τοῦτο δέ τινες Ἀριστοτέλει, οἱ δὲ Ῥόδωνι ἀνατιθέασιν.</p><p><strong>Suda, s.v.

<p>By Lane Wagner –&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/wagslane">@wagslane</a> on Twitter</p>



<p>Lattice-based cryptography has been coming into the spotlight recently. In January 2019, Many of the semifinalists in the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/01/nist-reveals-26-algorithms-advancing-post-quantum-crypto-semifinals">NIST post-quantum-cryptography competition</a> were based on lattices. Let’s explore the basics of lattices and how they apply to cryptosystems.</p>



<h2><span id="What_is_a_Lattice">What is a Lattice?</span>
</h2>



<p> According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography">Wikipedia</a>, a lattice&nbsp;is the set of all integer linear combinations of basis vectors:</p>



<div><div>
<div><figure><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/66095403ff779502911d684cccf77daff8981b56" alt="{\displaystyle \mathbf {b} _{1},\ldots ,\mathbf {b} _{n}\in \mathbb {R} ^{n}}" width="128" height="21"></figure></div>
</div></div>



<p>i.e.</p>



<div><div>
<div><figure><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bfe3dc9615c168ff919b1c5b229ad392229b8c1d" alt="{\displaystyle L={\Big \{}\sum a_{i}\mathbf {b} _{i}\ :\ a_{i}\in \mathbb {Z} {\Big \}}\;.}"></figure></div>
</div></div>



<p>More simply put, a lattice is defined by basis vectors, which are only able to be scaled by integers… yay no fractions! </p>



<p>For example, let’s create a lattice of all the integers in a two-dimensional plane:</p>



<figure><img src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-1024x740.png" alt="two dimensional lattice" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-1024x740.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-300x217.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-768x555.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-100x72.png 100w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-862x623.png 862w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-1200x867.png 1200w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture.png 1255w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-1024x740.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-300x217.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-768x555.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-100x72.png 100w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-862x623.png 862w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-1200x867.png 1200w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture.png 1255w" data-src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-1024x740.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure><p>The definition of our lattice contains only 2 basis vectors,</p>



<p>v1 = (0,1) </p>



<p>v2 = (1,0)</p>

There is no way to scale v1 (0,3) and v2 (3,0) to reach those points without using fractional scalars. With lattices, we can only scale by whole integers.</p>



<h2><span id="How_Does_This_Help_With_Crypto">How Does This Help With Crypto?</span>
</h2>



<p>Cryptographic algorithms are typically based on mathematical problems that are easy to verify the answer of, but hard to calculate.</p>



<p>For example, RSA is based on prime factorization. If I told you to find prime factors of 27,919,645,564,169,759, that would be hard. However, if I told you that 48,554,491 and 575,016,749 are prime factors, all you have to do is multiply them together in order to verify my answer.</p>



<p>RSA works great with classical computers. There are <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/10590/what-makes-rsa-secure-by-using-prime-numbers">no known solutions to find prime factors</a> of a number reliably in less than exponential time.</p>

<p>In this introductory article, we will take a brief look at one of the more well-known lattice problems that are of use in cryptosystems, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_problem#Shortest_vector_problem_(SVP)">the shortest vector problem (SVP)</a>.</p>



<p>Simply put, the goal of SVP is for the attacker to find the shortest vector from the origin (above in red) when given the basis of a lattice (above in blue). A zero vector doesn’t work as an answer, we consider it trivial.</p>



<p>How is it solved?</p>



<p>Like RSA with classical computers, it is hard to find the shortest vector of a large lattice, especially if it exists in many dimensions. One such slow solution for approximating the shortest vector is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Babai">Babai</a>‘s algorithm, or <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/teaching/lattices_fall_2004/ln/cvp.pdf">Nearest Plane Algorithm</a>, which you can read about in the links provided.</p>

More than <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marybethferrante/2020/03/06/millennial-working-parents-you-are-poised-to-fight-gender-equality/#329175c63c78">78% of millennial couples</a> (the people with the young kids today) are dual working.<em><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/12/12/u-s-children-more-likely-than-children-in-other-countries-to-live-with-just-one-parent/#:~:text=Almost%20a%20quarter%20of%20U.S.,who%20do%20so%20(7%25)"> </a></em><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/12/12/u-s-children-more-likely-than-children-in-other-countries-to-live-with-just-one-parent/#:~:text=Almost%20a%20quarter%20of%20U.S.,who%20do%20so%20(7%25)">Almost a quarter of kids</a> are being raised in single-parent households. What family looks like has never been more varied.<br>In the ultimate irony, we say that families are the cornerstone of our society, but we’re not willing to see that that foundation is crumbling and barely holding up. Over the past 3 decades, as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/why-child-care-so-expensive/602599/">childcare costs have nearly doubled</a> and the number of dual working households has climbed, we’ve asked parents to continue to push through, making them feel like the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/opinion/sunday/the-real-mommy-war-is-against-the-state.html">failure was theirs when they came up short</a> .</p><p>But in a post-COVID world? There is no hiding from the fact of how broken systems are for today’s parents. If there are any silver linings, it’s that this crisis has laid bare the cracks. It has pushed parents to and over the edge of trying to just “muscle through”.</p></div><p>So one way or another, there will be change as we do the hard, messy work of reimagining what having a family in the 21st century should look like. And while they’re interrelated, this change falls roughly into five categories:</p><div><p>This is vast and complicated terrain, but here are 12 ideas and conversation starters that can help us reimagine and rebuild the future we want to live in:</p><p><strong><em>In the future:</em><br>1. Parents won’t have to choose between quality of care and its cost.</strong><br>Today, because US parents are expected to shoulder the vast majority of the cost related to childcare, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/27/parents-spending-42-billion-on-early-child-care-each-year.html#:~:text=That's%20on%20par%20with%20other,on%20summer%20child%20care%20alone">access to high-quality, affordable care is hard to come by</a>.</p><p>That pushes parents to compromise on quality and keeps childcare in the grey. First stop to change? Effective gov’t and employer-supported childcare/early ed. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/us/politics/biden-workplace-childcare.html">Today’s announcement from Joe Biden</a> is a promising start.</p><p><strong>2. We’ll have access to $10/day daycare.</strong><br>It’s a time for boldness and nothing is as bold as the idea of <a href="https://www.10aday.ca/">$10/day daycare</a> as it is in places like Canada, Japan, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Australia. Not a coincidence, those same countries have the highest female labor participation rates in the world. But it needs to be a national priority.</p><p><strong>3. Childcare will be a profession, and great caregivers will be rewarded as such.</strong><br>Right now, it’s impossible to make a real living doing childcare or eldercare. It’s a transient occupation that can’t sustain someone as a career — but it shouldn’t be that way. To fix childcare quality and supply problems, we have to first make it a profession that is worth having – financially and emotionally. With clear qualifications, access to benefits and proper wages (current averages are $9-15/hr – no wonder most is in the gray economy), we can start to build the childcare system we all need.</p><p><strong>4. Welcome to the Club: New parents will feel supported from the start.</strong><br>Ideas like the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22751415">Finnish baby box</a> and <a href="https://www.peps.org/">PEPS</a> will be for every parent, to ensure every baby has an equal start on life and that parents never feel alone in their journey.</p><p><strong>5. Parental Leave: Universal access to paid leave for both mothers and fathers.</strong><br>Advances in leave will include offering leave for both parents. The Swedish system offers 16 mo, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sweden-maternity-leave-paternity-leave-policies-latte-dads-2018-4#:~:text=The%20Swedish%20government%20says%20that,child%20is%208%20years%20old">available until the child is 8, which are shared across both parents</a> . There are also other options, like what the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/upshot/paid-parental-leave-sweet-spot-six-months-gates.html">Gates Foundation offers</a> , of 6 mo leave + $20K stipend for childcare/other costs.</p><p><strong>6. Change the default: Women will no longer be the default primary parent.</strong><br>Today, from maternity leave to which parent gets the call from school, we default to the <a href="https://www.mother.ly/life/true-life-im-the-default-parent">mother as primary parent</a> . In the future, we won’t assume it’s the mother caring for kids full-time or opting for a flex job. We’ll explicitly ask for and acknowledge each family’s preference. No assumptions.</p><p><strong>7. Fluid careers. It will no longer be so punitive to take career breaks.</strong><br>Whether paid (as in the Swedish system until the kid is 8) or unpaid, parents will be able to step in and out of the workforce with less friction. It will be commonplace to have “resume gaps” that tie to caregiving responsibilities, and that experience will count for something instead of being shoved under the rug. Right now, it is incredibly hard for parents (mostly women) to come back into the workforce after having kids making it too punitive to take a step out of the workforce.</p><p>In the future, it will be much easier to take this approach post kids, tag teaming with a partner to come in and out of the workplace. We know that there are so many ways you can concoct a career today. We don’t have to stick to this default / linear model of “start working at 22 and stop at 65” and employers will be active participants in building family-friendly career paths.</p><p><strong>8. HomeTech will be about connecting the people, not the things.</strong><br>Right now,, the race is to connect lightbulbs, doorbells and speakers in our homes. In future, we’ll be more concerned about connecting the people. HomeTech will make information around care, schedules and development central and collaborative among household members.</p><p><strong>9. Design for collaboration.</strong><br>One simple example is to<strong> </strong>make household accounts the standard. Most software requires users to create their own accounts. For family-related services, like accounts related to kids’ activities, this is challenging – the best solution for parents is often to insecurely share one login. We need to make the idea of Household accounts the norm, to which you can attach any number of users with different settings and preferences.</p><p><strong>10. Superstar teachers will be the rule, not the exception.</strong><br>What would it take for teachers to have the same spotlight as top celebrities? Wouldn’t it be incredible to live in a country where teachers are idolized? We need to celebrate and reward this critical profession in a way that not only attracts the best minds, but keeps them engaged and innovating in the most important investment sector we have.</p><p><strong>11. Role for everyone in the neighborhood.</strong><br>Today’s communities are very siloed, especially generationally. In the future, there won’t be such a hard line between people with kids and those without – everyone will have a role in each other’s lives. We’ll create a space where having families feels more fluid, parents get the vital help they need from those w/o kids, such as empty nesters, and we’ll normalize the idea that not everyone has to have kids to play an important role with kids in the neighborhood. We can even employ the <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mothers-covid-19-bailout-carecorps_n_5efccc22c5b612083c560618">bold idea of a CareCorps to make this happen</a>.</p><p><strong>12. Access to the best education will be available to all.</strong><br>The differences in opportunities in public/private systems will no longer be so stark. The best education won’t just be for those who can afford expensive private lessons and can drive kids everywhere. The best lessons with the best teachers, from math to art to piano to coding, will be available from your home and for all families, from dedicated, immersive screens.</p></div><p>Building the future of families is a complicated thing, interconnected and messy. But there is no going back.</p></div>]]>

  <h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>

<p>In the past few posts we’ve gone over how to interpret matrices, basis vectors, and eigenvectors. Today, we’ll put all that together towards a really fun goal - building a toy quantum computer at home!  We’ll even solve a real problem on this “computer” that we couldn’t solve as efficiently on a standard computer.</p>

<p>All this will continue our understanding of the diverse and exciting applications of Linear Algebra.</p>

<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h3>

<p>We are going to build a toy “quantum computer” just using a display, and a few polarizing filters.</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> $20</p>

<p><strong>Materials</strong></p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/materials.jpg">
These are all the materials we will use. A cell phone, and a linear polarizer filter sheet.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your cell phone (or any display/light).</li>
  <li>
    <p>A polarization sheet such as the one in the link below.</p>

<h3 id="using-light-to-harness-quantum-properties">Using Light to Harness Quantum Properties</h3>

<p>To begin our process of building a computer we need to understand one of the foundational concepts in physics - light! Physicists in the 20th century developed quantum mechanics by studying some of the incredible properties of light. A few of these examples are shown below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect">Photoelectric Effect (the discovery that Einstein won his Nobel Prize for)</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Showed light is composed of discrete units called photons.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iuv6hY6zsd0">Double-Slit Experiment</a>
    <ul>
      <li>One of the seminal experiments in proving light can behave as both a wave and a particle.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXfrncRey-4">Black Body Radiation problem</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Studied by Max Planck and led to the discovery of Planck’s constant - a fundamental number in Quantum Mechanics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In this project, we will use the quantum properties of light to create something like a computer. Specifically, we will use a property of light known as polarization to carry out computations in our computer.</p>

<p>Let’s now dive into what exactly light polarization is and how we can leverage it.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="polarization-overview">Polarization Overview</h2>

<p>In the 1800s, Maxwell <a href="https://www.space.com/speed-of-light-properties-explained.html">famously discovered</a> that light is a direct consequence of electricity and magnetism (in fact, the movement of electrons in space generates light!). He found that light is an <strong>electromagnetic</strong> wave (an electric and magnetic field that travels through space).</p>

<p>In this electromagnetic wave, there are two parts: the electric field wave and the magnetic field wave. We call direction of orientation of the electric field the <strong>polarization</strong> of light.</p>

<p>

    Image source: https://socratic.org/questions/58f0fd7e7c0149308e221579
</p>

<hr>

<p>You may be surprised at just how often we use polarization everyday. For instance, any time you put on a pair of polarized sunglasses on a sunny day, you are harnessing light polarization! The black lenses on polarized sunglasses block certain types of light to reduce the glare that we see. The lenses do so by only letting in light of a certain polarization angle and blocking all other light.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/sunglasses.png">
    The lenses on polarized sunglasses are polarization filters that only allow light of a specific polarization through. Image Source (https://vision-works.co.za/polarized-lenses-explained/)

    A sunglass lens is a specific example of a polarization filter - a barrier that only lets in light of a specific polarization angle.
</p>
<p>This may seem fairly straight forward but as we study polarization more, we notice some really counterintuitive properties that are in fact deeply rooted in quantum mechanics. Namely, light can seemingly be polarized in multiple states at once!</p>

<h2 id="photons-can-be-polarized-in-multiple-directions-at-once">Photons Can Be Polarized in Multiple Directions at Once</h2>

<p>Let us now dig into what makes light polarization so useful in building a quantum computer.</p>

<p>Through experiments, we  will see that a single photon of light can be polarized <strong>in multiple directions at once</strong>. This is an idea rooted in quantum physics known as <strong>superposition.</strong>.</p>

<p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UjaAxUO6-Uw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
    <br>
    In the thought experiment, Schrodinger's Cat is somehow both **dead and alive** at the same time. In the same way, a photon of light can be polarized **in multiple directions** at the same time.
</p>

<p>You may have seen superposition in the famous Schrodinger’s Cat paradox where the cat is somehow both   “dead” and “alive” at the same time. This is exactly what we’ll see is going on with the state of a photon’s polarization!</p>

<h3 id="experiments">Experiments</h3>

<p>Let us now see this ourselves! We will run a set of experiments to in fact ourselves verify that <strong>light can be polarized in multiple angles at once.</strong>. Note with a large set of photons we can explain these effects using classical physics but when we get down to single photons, we need to use the quantum interpretation we will soon discuss.</p>

<p>Here are the experiments we will run:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Experiment 1 -</strong> Shows how polarizers work to help us develop an intuition.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment 2 -</strong> Shows that if light is vertically polarized it cannot be horizontally polarized.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment 3 -</strong> Shows that introducing a 45º&nbsp;polarizer allows light to be superposed in multiple polarizations at once.</li>
</ul>

<p>These experiments are heavily based on the following video from Minute Physics and 3Blue1Brown.</p>

<h3 id="experiment-1---effect-of-vertical-polarizer">Experiment 1 - Effect of Vertical polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Our first experiment is going to simply show what a vertical polarizer does. We’ll be able to see that it blocks out some amount of light and only lets vertically polarized light through.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Only vertically polarized light comes out of that section.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it in Action</strong></p>

<p>Below is my phone with a small vertical polarizer on the top left corner.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/phone_vertical.jpg">
    A vertical polarizer is present on the top-left corner of the screen.
</p>

<hr>

<p>Conceptually, the polarizer in the top-left corner is blocking everything but vertically polarized light as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_1.png" alt="Phone Blocked"></p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>

<p>A vertically polarized filter only lets vertically polarized light out.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="experiment-2---effect-of-vertical--horizontal-polarizer">Experiment 2 - Effect of Vertical + Horizontal Polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Our next experiment will show that vertically polarized light is entirely blocked by a horizontal polarizer. We will place a horizontal polarizer on top of a vertical polarizer and see that little to no light comes through.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Place a horizontal filter on the same section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Notice how little to no light now appears.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it In Action</strong></p>

<p>Below is my phone with a both a vertical and horizontal polarizer in sequence (the yellow tab shows the orientation of the polarizer). Notice how we can no longer read the screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/phone_blocked.png" alt="Phone Blocked"></p>

<hr>

<p>With the addition of the horizontal polarizer, all light is effectively blocked in the top-left corner of the screen as seen below:</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_2.png">
    A vertical polarizer followed by a horizontal polarizer will block all light.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Vertically polarized light cannot go through a horizontal filter.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="experiment-3---effect-of-vertical--45º--horizontal-polarizer">Experiment 3 - Effect of Vertical + 45º + Horizontal polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>This is the fun part! We now get to see what happens when you place a 45º&nbsp;filter in between a vertical and horizontal polarizing filter. What we’d expect is the same as in experiment 2 - no light gets through. If polarizers just block light, surely adding a third polarizer will only block more light.</p>

<p>However,  what we end up seeing is quite unexpected!</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Place a horizontal filter on top of it.</li>
  <li>Place a 45º&nbsp;filter in between the vertical and horizontal filter.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it in Action</strong></p>

<p>Adding the diagonal polarizer really does let some light through (about 50% of it)! You can see this below as I move a diagonally oriented polarizer between the vertical and horizontal polarizer.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/diagonal_polarizer.gif" alt="Diagonal Polarizer"></p>

<hr>

<p>Adding the diagonal polarizer somehow leads to <strong>more light</strong> against all expectations! We can see what’s happening in the diagram below. We will explain this more in the following section so don’t worry too much if you don’t understand it.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3.png">
    A vertical filter followed by a 45º filter and then a horizontal filter will let some light through.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Light that is seemingly vertically polarized can somehow become horizontally polarized.</li>
  <li>The 45º filter is needed for this change to happen. Without it we see no light can come out.
    <ul>
      <li>Without 45º filter</li>
    </ul>

    <p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_2.png" alt="Experiment 2"></p>

    <ul>
      <li>With 45º&nbsp;filter</li>
    </ul>

    <p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3.png" alt="Experimenet 3"></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="understanding-experiment-3">Understanding Experiment 3</h2>

<p>So what is going on in Experiment 3? How does vertically polarized light go through the 45º&nbsp;filter?</p>

<h3 id="thinking-of-photons-as-combinations">Thinking of Photons as Combinations</h3>

<p>We can think of a vertical line/vector (black) as the sum of a 135º (blue) vector&nbsp;and 45º (purple) vector. This is shown below:</p>

<div>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/vectors.png">
        A vertical line can be seen as a sum of diagonal line 1 and diagonal line 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/vectors_expanded.png">
            The horizontal components of 1 and 2 cancel out when added, leading to a vertical line.
    </p>        
</div>

<p>So in that sense, we can think of a vertically filtered photon as the <strong>combination</strong> of a 135º filtered photon and a 45º filtered photon. Or in other words, the vertically filtered photon can be seen as filtered in <strong>both these angles at once</strong> (Note that it’s a very <strong>specific amount</strong> (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><msqrt><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msqrt></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">  \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} </annotation></semantics></math></span></span>) of each of these options. But we are going to postpone that discussion for now).</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/photon_sum.png">
    A vertically filtered photon can be seen as a combination of a 45º polarized photon and a 135º polarized photon.
</p>

<p>Equipped with this idea, let’s now revisit experiment 4’s setup. We are going to break it up into <strong>Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_broken_up.png" alt="Experiment 3 Broken Up"></p>

<p>We will break up Experiment 3 into three steps.</p>

<h3 id="step-1---vertical-filter">Step 1 - Vertical Filter</h3>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_step_1.png">
</p>

<p>Step 1 is fairly straightforward - The vertical polarizer only lets vertically polarized  photons through. The horizontally polarized photons get blocked.</p>

<h3 id="step-2---45ºfilter">Step 2 - 45º&nbsp;Filter</h3>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_step_2.png">

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>I’ve been writing Python for about eight years.</p>

<p>When you come from Java, Python is magic. You can get so much done in so little code.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Java be like</span>
<span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span>
    <span>String</span><span>[]</span> <span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Python be like
</span><span>', '</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>([</span><span>f"last: </span><span>{</span><span>x</span><span>[</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>]:.</span><span>2</span><span>f</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
          <span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>d</span><span>.</span><span>values</span><span>()])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I think I was too confused as an undergrad to really appreciate Python.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> But at some point, I looked back at Java and just—yikes! So much typing to <em>do</em> anything.</p>

<h2 id="the-world-discovers-python">The world discovers Python</h2>
<p>Machine learning runs on Python.</p>

<p>Matlab and Julia were fighting the good fight back in 2012, and it sort of looked like anybody’s ball game. Back then, I picked numpy. Once deep learning exploded, the heavy hitters Tensorflow and Pytorch both chose Python as their interface.</p>

<p>And since then, it’s Python, all the way down. Absolute globs, scads, and mountains of Python.</p>

<p>I write this only to tell you why I still use Python—because it’s the only first-class citizen in machine learning.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="i-discover-typescript">I discover TypeScript</h2>
<p>During 2017 and 2018, I spent my free time writing TypeScript for a little game called <a href="https://maxwellforbes.com/posts/fallgate">Fallgate</a>. TypeScript is based on JavaScript, which everyone loves to hate, and so I was prepared to hate TypeScript.</p>

<p>But then the funniest thing happened. I actually had a really great time writing TypeScript.</p>

<h2 id="the-elephant-in-the-room">The Elephant in the Room</h2>
<p>Yes, I was making a game with TypeScript, and attempting to do natural language processing (NLP) research with Python.</p>

<p>And yes, game programming, in my opinion, is a much more fun genre of <em>programming</em> than natural language processing.</p>

<p>Game programming has a stimulating feedback loop. When I built a new system for animation, lighting, particles, or movement, I’d immediately <em>see</em> the effects of the new feature. Plus, the actual code I wrote was interesting. The game programming centered around making real-time systems that efficiently managed interlocking behaviors for thousands of little game world entities. I got to try out new design patterns and play around in geometry, physics, and graphics.</p>

<p>On the other hand, programming for NLP research, I spend most of my time pushing big sludge piles of text data around. I scrape, annotate, clean, format, chunk, and batch text. I pour through text and find mountains of badly encoded files, non-linguistic junk like HTML, and of course, scads of idiots’ Internet blatherings—like this blog post! From a purely time-based perspective, I spend shockingly few hours actually building those cool neural network models everyone is excited about. And when I do, the models themselves were only a few dozen lines of code.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

</p>



<p>But aside from the (admittedly large) difference in <em>what</em> I was doing, there was a qualitative difference in the feel of the activity of programming.</p>

<h2 id="joy">Joy</h2>
<p>Programming in TypeScript brought me joy. It was easy. I felt like I always had a better handle on what options were available to me. I also felt more confidence about what was going to happen when my code ran.</p>

<p>Only through this contrast of using both languages in the same day did I realize how little joy I got from Python.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Why does it matter if Python sparks joy? When I first chose this headline, I thought it was funny. Now that I’m actually writing this, I’m becoming convinced it might be quite serious. We pour hundreds of the precious hours of our only life into our work. Seeking joy in the day to day, minute-to-minute experience of programming might be one of the more important things we can do.</p>

<p>What follows is a few posts in which I share my attempts to spark joy of Python back into my life. The first one is about static typing. I think it is the most important factor.</p>

<h3 id="disclaimers">Disclaimers</h3>
<p><strong>Familiarity</strong> — I’m assuming in these posts you’re moderately familiar with writing Python code. For example, I assume you understand kinds of stuff like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why people dislike <code>from &lt;name&gt; import *&nbsp;</code></li>
  <li>What if <code>__name__ == "__main__"</code> does</li>
  <li>That list comprehensions are idiomatic</li>
  <li>What <code>virutalenv</code>s are and why people use them</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Unfamiliarity</strong> — I’m also assuming you’re not a Python expert. Maybe you’re someone who picked it up as your first or second language in the last year or two. If you know too much, you will probably think that what I write is obvious, wrong, or both.</p>

<p><strong>Solo coding</strong> — I realized after almost finishing a draft that some of these practices are geared towards effectively programming by yourself.</p>

<p>How much discipline is necessary in solo coding? I found that after I stopped working for Google, I over-engineered most things I wrote, because I thought that writing production code for a company was “good practice” in general, and that I would be a more effective grad student if I wrote the same kind of code for my research. Many grad students (at least stereotypically) swing far on the other side of the spectrum: writing super hacky, unreadable code that barely works through a publication submission.</p>

<p>The best approach, at least for me, is probably somewhere in the middle. I realized after a few years that speed of creation in research code trumps industrial robustness,<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> but there were still a few habits that would minimize my own burden down the road.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I recently became aware of Jeff Bezosâ€™s dotcom-era policy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730231457/https://blog.hirevue.com/sales/what-i-learned-from-jeff-bezos-about-sales-management">banning PowerPoint</a> within Amazon. Instead, meeting organizers must write a multi-page â€œnarrativeâ€� and distribute it to all attendees at the start of the meeting - denying any single person a head start - and only after everyone has finished reading do proceedings begin.</p>

<p>This policy is particularly notable as it finds itself embedded in a company staffed largely by software engineers, who often have neither experience nor interest in writing prose. We feel most at home when transmitting ideas as algorithms, unambiguously described by mathematics and sequences of instructions. And the further we stray from this the more discontent we feel as the ambiguities of natural language leak through, needlessly eroding clarity.</p>

<p>But on closer examination I believe this is neither about powerpoint nor about reading - itâ€™s about thinking. To see why we need to look beyond the headline.</p>

<p>If we could peer into Jeffâ€™s 2004-era outbox we would find his original email:</p>

<div><p>
From: Bezos, Jeff <br>
Sent: Wednesday, June 09, 2004 6:02PM <br>
To: [REDACTED] <br>
Subject: Re: No powerpoint presentations from now on at steam </p><p>

A little more to help with the question "why." <br>
Well structured, narrative text is what we're after rather than just text. If someone builds a list of bullet points in word, that would be just as bad as powerpoint. <br>
The reason writing a good 4 page memo is harder than "writing" a 20 page powerpoint is because the narrative structure of a good memo forces better thought and better understanding of what's more important than what, and how things are related. <br>
Powerpoint-style presentations somehow give permission to gloss over ideas, flatten out any sense of relative importance, and ignore the interconnectedness of ideas. </p><p>

Jeff
</p></div>

<p>The point being made is clear from the language: â€œwritingâ€� is mentioned twice but â€œreadingâ€� not at all. Itâ€™s  <em>creation</em> which is important, not <em>consumption</em>. Even if the memo was written and immediately shredded, the act of writing would not be undone and the improvement to thought and understanding would persist.</p>

<p>Still, for a company trying to be <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/working/working-amazon">Earthâ€™s most customer-centric company</a>, it is hard to shake the feeling that time would be best spent interacting with, say, <em>customers</em>, rather than crafting narratives.</p>

<p>But Amazon is far from the first to recognise the value in the writing process. Some go even further:</p>

<blockquote cite="David McCullough">Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That's why it's so hard.</blockquote>

<p>And here I think itâ€™s worth digging even further to ask - why is thinking clearly important? <em>Obviously</em> - in our context of software engineering - if you donâ€™t think clearly then any solutions you craft as an individual will be suboptimal.</p>

<p>That is undoubtedly true. But more importantly, writing a coherent and logical narrative forces your thoughts into a shape which can be easily communicated to others and used to persuade. None of us work in isolation. There is little point in having the answer if you cannot convince others of its merit.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Letâ€™s imagine a team of engineers. Having just been informed of the firm-wide mandate to migrate from in-house servers to the cloud, they must make the impactful and long-lasting decision about which technology to introduce. In an attempt to reach consensus theyâ€™ve gathered around a pizza and begin exchanging views.</p>

<p>The Kubernetes guy <em>knows</em> that only his solution leads to a future free from tedious discussions around the solved problems of authentication and service discovery. Batteries must be included. Three slices to the right another engineer brims with confidence and espouses the virtues of Nomad - single-purpose, orthogonal and composable components are the <em>bedrock</em> of well-engineered software systems. Principles must come first.</p>

<p>After an hour of discussion bouncing from feature to feature to pro to con to bug to feature, everyone has learned something new. But no one is persuaded and no consensus has emerged. Though useful for knowledge exchange, such unstructured discussions are not an efficient mechanism for reaching agreement.</p>

<p>What is needed to break the stalemate is for a single individual<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> to spin a narrative which captures the journey from business need through to practicalities of implementation, in a comprehensive, flowing and logical manner. This would be persuasive - it would instill in others the confidence that this is not just the best technology in an abstract sense, itâ€™s the right choice for <em>our problem</em>, <em>our business</em>, and <em>our people</em> at <em>this point in time</em>.</p>

<p>It would be useful for others to read this. But even if they didnâ€™t, the newfound clarity of mind of the creator would allow them to make an argument persuasive enough to break the stalemate of ideas.</p>

<p>For this particular situation - the choice of a technology - the writer will likely have thought about and touched on:</p>

<p><strong>The beginning</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>What were the underlying reasons for the decision to change technologies? Why is this worthwhile embarking on and what benefits will be seen?</li>
  <li>What reason do we have for investigating this particular tech as a solution? What other alternatives are worth investigating?</li>
  <li>How high are the stakes? Are we laying the foundations of the cathedral or painting the bike shed? Can we easily switch later if things arenâ€™t working out?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The middle</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Does the tech being suggested have a mission statement or core guiding principles? How does that tie in with our problem and philosophy?</li>
  <li>If we roll with it, whatâ€™s the end goal? When implementation is complete, what does the world look like?</li>
  <li>How might we get from where we are to where we want to be with minimal disruption? What might the transition period look like? How long, roughly?</li>
  <li>Do we have any existing in-house expertise?</li>
  <li>Are there any risks? What steps might we take to reduce them? Any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns">unknown unknowns</a>?</li>
  <li>In what ways might this solution fare better than the alternative(s)?</li>
  <li>In what ways might the alternative(s) fare better than this?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The end</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Relate back to the underlying business needs and sum up with a recommendation, explaining why this the best option</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, the content of the narrative would overlap substantially with a technical design document. But whereas a TDD is an end in itself, the physical output of this writing is a pleasant side-effect. What matters are the organised thoughts left in the mind of the author.</p>

<p>Having competently translated these thoughts into natural language once before, the author will have no trouble doing so again when called upon, orally and in real-time. And having considered the problem at several levels of analysis - as must be done to write well - they will, at a moments notice, be able to adapt their narrative to suit any audience, regardless of their existing knowledge.</p>

<p>Finally, unlike specialised tools, narratives are general. They scale. From the narrowest of technical issues up to the most fundamental question of the mission and purpose of the company as a whole, there are no problems which resist clear-thinking.</p>

        <p><b>We’ve all seen the good QA director in their natural habitat, a creature who spends their time bathing in the light of an LED monitor, or perhaps gently lapping at a local coffee stream. But have you ever witnessed a <i>great</i> one?</b></p>
<p>If you have, you can consider yourself lucky. This endangered breed of QA director, with their boundless enthusiasm and an uncanny ability to nurture the young, is difficult to spot. But if we watch carefully, we can learn from their ways. And perhaps they will share with us knowledge that can make us better QA professionals.</p>
<p>How do you recognize these cryptids in the wild? This week on QA Safari: We identify the markings of the rare superb QA director and compare them with the merely good one.</p>
<h3>A good QA director: Begins work in the testing phase<br>
A great QA director: Begins work in the requirements phase</h3>
<p>A good QA director starts the job on the first day of <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/software-development-when-slow-and-steady-doesnt-win-the-race/">the testing phase</a> in the software development lifecycle. A great QA director? They’ve already been stalking their prey of bugs for weeks, if not months, to assure that users have a seamless experience.</p>
<p>An exceptional QA director begins their work “in the requirements phase,” says Sami Ullah, a former QA tester and current sales manager at <a href="https://www.kualitatem.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kualitatem</a>. That way, “You’re making sure that the project is being built on quality principles.”</p>
<p>These principles include usability, resilience, and protecting the herd against predators.</p>
<p>A great QA director also thinks about the future. Kenny Trinh, editor of <a href="https://www.netbooknews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netbook News</a>, says, “They personally invest their own time in ensuring that future works will have better quality.” The apex QA director accomplishes this by creating their own documents or perhaps by coordinating with their superiors and training content creators.</p>
<p><i>The worst QA director: Doesn’t plan ahead. </i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobbing_(animal_behavior)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Easily mobbed</i></a><i> by its own prey.</i></p>
<h3>A good QA director: Can think like a QA director</h3>
<h3>A great QA director: Can also think like a user</h3>
<p>Developers design company products based on user requirements. But do users or product owners <i>really</i> know what they want? As developers can tell you, usually through bared teeth, not always.</p>
<p>While a good QA director tests software and finds errors, a great one assures these errors never happen in the first place—by studying user requirements and discovering what’s missing. A great QA director looks at efficiency of a system early in the development process, feeding back usability issues to developers before they become un-usability issues.</p>
<p>This isn’t limited to computing woes. As John Moss, CEO of <a href="https://www.englishblinds.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">English Blinds</a> says, “A great QA director knows how to mitigate customer pain points and head them off effectively.” This means the user will have a better experience…and so will the client.</p>
<p>A top-notch QA director can draw from <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/what-testers-should-know-about-domain-knowledge/">a deep knowledge base about the problem domain</a> yet doesn’t lose sight of the user when stuck in the technical trenches. Just as a good hunter doesn’t lose sight of its prey.</p>
<p><i>The worst QA director: Takes user requirements at face value, and that face has razor-sharp teeth.</i></p>
<h3>A good QA director: Follows existing process to the letter</h3>
<h3>A great QA director: Spots the flaws in company process</h3>
<p>Existing processes are there for a reason: They worked before, whether it’s for testing software or for using a mating call to attract a partner. But as even the animal kingdom knows, past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. Apply previous processes to your current testing case, and you may find your software has flaws and that you missed the window on mating season.</p>
<p>A good QA director follows standard operating procedures, but a great QA director’s operating procedures aren’t one-size-fits-all. According to Alex Kehoe, co-founder and operations director of web development firm <a href="https://caveni.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caveni.com</a>, “A great QA director is someone who can spot the failings of current processes and facilitate the creation of new ones that are able to fix those shortcomings.”</p>
<p>If your team is missing obvious bugs, it’s time to look beyond the expected.</p>
<p><i>The worst QA director: Misses bugs in favor of fine-tuning their mating call.</i></p>
<h3>A good QA director: Takes charge</h3>
<h3>A great QA director: Knows when to pass the reins to their team</h3>
<p>Just as two difference species can cooperate in the wild, a great QA director cooperates with their underlings. “Being a QA director requires trust in your team and confidence that they can complete projects and tasks without micromanaging,”&nbsp;says Sarah Franklin, co-founder of marketing firm <a href="https://bluetree.ai/">Blue Tree AI</a>.</p>
<p>This advice applies to most IT professions, but deserves special mention when it comes to QA directors: Micromanaging is a time-sucking process, and if QA doesn’t adhere to tight deadlines, they are culled from the herd.</p>
<p>The best QA directors teach newer team members and provide useful assistance. The wisdom they impart might include <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-mobile-testing-gotchas-you-need-to-know-about/">how to design tests for mobile devices</a>, <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/how-to-deliver-a-technical-presentation-to-a-non-technical-audience/">how to prepare reports for management consumption</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleaner_fish#Salmonid_aquaculture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to nibble on parasitic sea lice</a>.</p>
<p><i>The worst QA director: Pushes young competitors out of the herd.</i></p>
<h3>A good QA director: Knows every inch of their tools</h3>
<h3>A great QA director: Constantly improves their skill set</h3>
<p>As with every species on Earth, technology is constantly evolving. The tools a QA professional uses to test today aren’t the same tools they used five years ago. Logically, the tools a QA tester uses won’t be the same five years from now.</p>
<p>A good QA director may know their current tools and can troubleshoot for their team. A great QA director, however, can see the latest developments in testing software on the horizon. They’re even aware of the latest technologies, such as artificial intelligence, with its tricky-to-validate results.</p>
<p>As Ullah says, the best QA directors “keep on improving their skill set.”</p>
<p>So when your company begins a complex new project, the best QA director will be there, ready to implement testing tools that <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/how-to-do-a-product-evaluation-for-enterprise-software/">they already researched, explored, priced out</a>. Who knows? Maybe they’re so skilled, they’ll eve discover fire.</p>
<p><i>The worst QA director: Fails to evolve. Joins the passenger pigeon and the dodo as a footnote in natural history.</i></p>
<blockquote><p>What does it take to develop top-notch QA management skills? Perhaps your company needs a <a href="https://www.functionize.com/project/why-your-enterprise-needs-a-cqo-chief-quality-officer/">Chief Quality Officer</a>.</p></blockquote>

			<p>Dashboard gives a graphical interface to visualize the key indicators and trends of your data. However, Creating Dashboard is always been a tedious task for developers</p>

<p>They have to wear a Front-end Dev hat for creating a Web Dashboard. Switching gears from python to Javscript/HTML is not what all developers prefer to do.</p>

<p>There are libraries like Plotly Dash, Bokeh in Python which let you generate a dashboard using python and even some people convert a Jupyter notebook into a dashboard</p>

<p>Somehow I didn’t find all these options really an easy available options to create a dashboard in Python so my Search for easy to use and a user friendly Library in pure python continues and Finally I found something much easier way to do that.</p>

<p>Yes, Streamlit which is recently gaining popularity in the Machine Learning and Data science world is a super easy library which is around to develop a dashboard in almost no time</p>

<p>The good part is that it comes with an in-built web server too and can be easily deployed inside a docker container.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we will build a dashboard using COVID19 US Data. Here is the snapshot of the dashboard that you will see at the end of the tutorial</p>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/07/pydash_01.gif" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="collect-data-from-wikipedia">Collect data from Wikipedia</h2>

<p>We will use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States">wikipedia data</a> for this dashboard. Following are the two sets of data that you can download:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Last 15 days data of Covid-19 Cases in the United States data from 19th June 2020 to 7th July 2020 at the time of writing this article</li>
  <li>COVID-19 pandemic in the United States <strong>by state and territory</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>We will download both these data in two csv files and rename as usa_covid_data_states.csv and usa_total_cases.csv</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>​	usa_covid_data_states.csv</p>

    <p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/07/image-07.png" alt=""></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>​    usa_total_cases.csv</p>

    <p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/07/image-08.png" alt=""></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="installing-streamlit-and-creating-dashboard">Installing Streamlit and Creating Dashboard</h2>

<p>Streamlit can be installed using pip:</p>



<p>Now to start creating a dashboard let’s first create a simple python file main.py and import streamlit and add the Heading and paragraph at the dashboard start</p>

<p>We will also import pandas for reading the above two csv files created using the wikipedia data</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>streamlit</span> <span>as</span> <span>st</span>
<span>import</span> <span>pandas</span> <span>as</span> <span>pd</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="load-the-two-files-in-the-dataframe">Load the two files in the dataframe</h3>

<div><div><pre><code><span>csv_file_state</span> <span>=</span> <span>'usa_covid_data.csv'</span>
<span>csv_file_total_cases</span> <span>=</span> <span>'usa_total_cases.csv'</span>
<span>df</span><span>=</span> <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>read_csv</span><span>(</span><span>csv_file_total_cases</span><span>,</span><span>parse_dates</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>'Date'</span><span>])</span>
<span>dfstate</span> <span>=</span> <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>read_csv</span><span>(</span><span>csv_file_state</span><span>)</span> 
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="title-and-markdowns">Title and Markdowns</h3>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/07/image-02.png" alt="image-20200704143234887"></p>

<p>Streamlit has a number of ways to add text to your app. Let’s add a title out to Dashboard. We will also use markdown to add subtext or small paragraphs and write ups in our dashboard</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>st</span><span>.</span><span>title</span><span>(</span><span>"Covid19 USA Data from Wikipedia"</span><span>)</span>
<span>st</span><span>.</span><span>markdown</span><span>(</span>
<span>"""
This app is for visualizing the Covid19 data for USA which is collected 
from the wikipedia site https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States.        
User can select the Metrics Type from the drop-down list to see the trend in last 15 days
"""</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="dropdowns-in-streamlit">Dropdowns in Streamlit</h3>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/07/image-03.png" alt="image-20200704143256090"></p>

<p>We will add a dropdown for user to select the following trend and plot</p>

<ol>
  <li>Total Cases</li>
  <li>Deaths</li>
  <li>Recoveries</li>
</ol>

<p>Use <a href="https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/api.html#streamlit.selectbox"><code>st.selectbox</code></a> to choose from a series. You can write in the options you want, or pass through an array or data frame column.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>st</span><span>.</span><span>markdown</span><span>(</span><span>"## "</span> <span>+</span> <span>'TotalCases/Deaths/Recoveries Trend'</span><span>)</span>	
<span>st</span><span>.</span><span>markdown</span><span>(</span><span>"#### "</span> <span>+</span><span>"What Trends would you like to see?"</span><span>)</span>

<span>selected_metrics</span> <span>=</span> <span>st</span><span>.</span><span>selectbox</span><span>(</span>
    <span>label</span><span>=</span><span>"Choose..."</span><span>,</span> <span>options</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>'TotalCases'</span><span>,</span><span>'Deaths'</span><span>,</span><span>'Recoveries'</span><span>]</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="plot--charts-and-maps">Plot  Charts and Maps</h3>

<p>Streamlit supports several popular data charting libraries like Matplotlib, Altair, Plotly etc.</p>

<p>We will use Plotly to draw charts for our dashboard</p>

<p>So we created the dropdown above and want to display the TotalCases/Deaths/Recoveries Trend based on user selection</p>

<p>We have directly use the dataframe columns as x and y data for adding traces based on user selection and You can easily add the  chart to your app with st.plotly_chart()</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Create traces

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/07/image-04.png" alt="image-20200704145232602"></p>

<p>Similarly you can add other charts that you wanted to draw with this data.</p>



<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/07/image-05.png" alt="image-20200704150358194"></p>

<p>Another great feature of streamlit is a sidebar that gives a more cleaner look and keeps your app central and all widgets can be moved to the left of the page. Let’s see how to create a sidebar widget and dropdown filter for state using st.sidebar</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>st</span><span>.</span><span>sidebar</span><span>.</span><span>title</span><span>(</span><span>"State-Wise Data"</span><span>)</span>
<span>State_list</span> <span>=</span> <span>st</span><span>.</span><span>sidebar</span><span>.</span><span>selectbox</span><span>(</span>
    <span>'state'</span><span>,</span>
     <span>dfstate</span><span>.</span><span>State</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We have passed the state list(dfstate.state) as data for the dropdown options.</p>

<p>You can almost put all elements on the side bar like st.title(), st.markdown() etc.</p>

<h2 id="starting-server-and-open-dashboard-in-browser">Starting server and open dashboard in Browser</h2>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/07/image-06.png" alt="image-20200704151922047"></p>

<p>Open a terminal and navigate to the path where main.py is located and start the streamlit web server</p>



<p>By default it will be running on port 8501. Open your browser and and hit this url <a href="http://localhost:8501/">http://localhost:8501</a> to see your dashboard in the browser</p>

<p>So with this we have completed the tutorial for creating a Covid19 US Dashboard using Streamlit. If you are looking for any customization to this dashboard then I will suggest to look at the official streamlit documentation</p>

<h2 id="deploy-streamlit-app-in-docker-container">Deploy Streamlit App in Docker Container</h2>

<p>We can also deploy the streamlit app inside a docker container. if there is any configuration related changes like changing the base url for the path then those changes can also be done in the docker file</p>

<p>Here is the Docker file which is in the same folder where main.py is located</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>FROM</span><span> python:3.7</span>

<span># exposing default port for streamlit</span>
<span>EXPOSE</span><span> 8501</span>

<span># making directory of app</span>
<span>WORKDIR</span><span> /streamlit-docker</span>

<span># copy over requirements</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> requirements.txt ./requirements.txt</span>

<span># installing required packages</span>
<span>RUN </span>pip3 <span>install</span> <span>-r</span> requirements.txt

<span># copying all app files to image</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> . .</span>

<span># cmd to launch app when container is run</span>
<span>CMD</span><span> streamlit run main.py</span>

<span># streamlit-specific commands for config</span>
<span>ENV</span><span> LC_ALL=C.UTF-8</span>
<span>ENV</span><span> LANG=C.UTF-8</span>
<span>RUN </span><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> /root/.streamlit
<span>RUN </span>bash <span>-c</span> <span>'echo -e "</span><span>\
</span><span>[general]\n</span><span>\
</span><span>email = \"\"\n</span><span>\
</span><span>" &gt; /root/.streamlit/credentials.toml'</span>

<span>RUN </span>bash <span>-c</span> <span>'echo -e "</span><span>\
</span><span>[server]\n</span><span>\
</span><span>baseUrlPath = \"coviddash\"\n</span><span>\
</span><span>" &gt; /root/.streamlit/config.toml'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next Run the following command to build a docker image and run the container</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Build Docker Image</p>

    <p>docker build -t coviddash .</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Run Docker container</p>

    <p>docker run coviddash</p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

    <p>We have seen streamlit can be used to build a beautiful and interactive dashboards and web apps, all with zero web development experience! We have seen how to load, explore, visualize and interact with data, and generate dashboards in less than 100 lines of Python code</p>

    <p>Eventually we can run this web app without using any external webserver since it has it’s own server powered by Tornado. It is easy to deploy in docker container too.</p>

    <p>I think this is the fastest and easiest method to Visualize your Machine Learning Algorithm and create Dashbaord on the go option available right now for Python developers</p>

    <p>You can find the complete code for this tutorial in my github repo <a href="https://github.com/min2bro/streamlittuts">here</a></p>

					<p>While the .NET Core documentation and libraries do a good job of providing an easy way to get started with hosted apps (web or otherwise), it is somewhat lacking in terms of the same guidance for simple run-to-completion type console apps. You can write a simple <code>Main()</code> method and do your stuff, but how do you get the advantage of the amazing configuration and dependency injection that you get out of the box with hosted apps? Surely, you could set up all that machinery and maybe create an <code>IHostedService</code> implementation just to get going. Even then, you are still left with a hosted app that you have to deal with shutting down after your logic is done.</p>
<p>If you look behind the builder methods that come out of the box with hosted apps, you will find that there is an easy way to get the good DI and configuration stuff and keep your simple <code>Main()</code> method app simple. To that end, I've written up a little <code>ProgramRunner</code> class that you can plop in and use as so (example .NET Core 3.1 code follows):</p>
<pre><code>public class ProgramOptions
{
    public string SomeOption { get; set; }
}

public class Program
{
    private readonly ProgramOptions _programOptions;

    public Program(IOptions&lt;ProgramOptions&gt; programOptions) =&gt; _programOptions = programOptions.Value;

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        ProgramRunner
            .WithConfiguration(c =&gt; c.AddJsonFile("appsettings.json"))
            .AndServices((s, c) =&gt; s
                .Configure&lt;ProgramOptions&gt;(o =&gt; c.Bind(o))
                .AddSingleton&lt;Program&gt;())
            .Run(p =&gt; p.GetService&lt;Program&gt;().Run());
    }

    public void Run() =&gt; Console.WriteLine(_programOptions.SomeOption);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Easy.</p>
<p>Here is the code for <code>ProgramRunner</code> referenced above (perhaps I will put it into a library at some point):</p>
<pre><code>public class ProgramRunner
{
    private Action&lt;IConfigurationBuilder&gt; _configurationBuilderAction;
    private Action&lt;IServiceCollection, IConfiguration&gt; _serviceCollectionAction;

    private ProgramRunner() { }

    public ProgramRunner AndConfiguration(Action&lt;IConfigurationBuilder&gt; configurationBuilderAction)
    {
        _configurationBuilderAction = configurationBuilderAction;
        return this;
    }

    public ProgramRunner AndServices(Action&lt;IServiceCollection, IConfiguration&gt; serviceCollectionAction)
    {
        _serviceCollectionAction = serviceCollectionAction;
        return this;
    }

    public static ProgramRunner WithConfiguration(Action&lt;IConfigurationBuilder&gt; configurationBuilderAction) =&gt; new ProgramRunner().AndConfiguration(configurationBuilderAction);
    public static ProgramRunner WithServices(Action&lt;IServiceCollection, IConfiguration&gt; serviceCollectionAction) =&gt; new ProgramRunner().AndServices(serviceCollectionAction);

    private IServiceProvider GetServiceProvider()
    {
        var configurationBuilder = new ConfigurationBuilder();
        _configurationBuilderAction?.Invoke(configurationBuilder);
        
        var configuration = configurationBuilder.Build();

        var serviceCollection = new ServiceCollection();
        _serviceCollectionAction?.Invoke(serviceCollection, configuration);
        
        return serviceCollection.BuildServiceProvider();
    }

    public void Run(Action&lt;IServiceProvider&gt; runAction) =&gt; runAction(GetServiceProvider());
    
    public T Run&lt;T&gt;(Func&lt;IServiceProvider, T&gt; runAction) =&gt; runAction(GetServiceProvider());
    
    public Task RunAsync(Func&lt;IServiceProvider, CancellationToken, Task&gt; runAction, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default) =&gt; runAction(GetServiceProvider(), cancellationToken);
    
    public Task&lt;T&gt; RunAsync&lt;T&gt;(Func&lt;IServiceProvider, CancellationToken, Task&lt;T&gt;&gt; runAction, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default) =&gt; runAction(GetServiceProvider(), cancellationToken);
</code></pre>
<p>And there you have it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    <h2>My computer</h2>
    <p>
        I use a Thinkpad T400s computer, which has a free
        initialization program (libreboot) and a free operating system
        (Trisquel GNU/Linux). It was not sold that way by Lenovo,
        however; small businesses buy them used, recondition them, and
        install the free software.  This is one of the
        computers <a href="https://ryf.fsf.org/">
        endorsed by the FSF</a>.

    </p><p>
        Before using such Thinkpads, I used the Lemote Yeeloong for
        several years.  At the time, it was the only laptop one could
        buy that could run a free initialization program and a free
        operating system.  But it was never sold with a free operating
        system.

    </p><p>
        Before that, I used an OLPC for some weeks.  The OLPC uses
        a nonfree firmware blob for the WiFi, so I could not use the internal
        WiFi device.  No big problem, I used an external WiFi adaptor.<br>
        I stopped using it because the OLPC project decided to make their
        machine support Windows, so I did not want to appear to endorse it
        by visibly carrying it around.  I could have continued using it
        privately with its free software installation, but I had no need
        for another computer to use only privately.

    </p><p>
        The results that seemed likely, millions of children running Windows
        on the OLPC, have not occurred.  Instead we see millions of children
        running Windows on the Intel Classmate, or nowadays a Chromebook
	that sends the child's personal data to Google.

    </p><p>
        Before that I used machines that ran completely free GNU/Linux
        systems but had nonfree BIOSes.  I tried for about 8 years to find a
        way to avoid the nonfree BIOS in some commercial machine.



    </p><h2>GNU/Linux distro</h2>
    <p>
        I do not have a preferred GNU/Linux distro.  I recommend all the
        <a href="http://www.gnu.org/distros">ethical distros</a> —
        namely, those that are 100% free software.

    </p><p>
        I've chosen not to have any preferences among those ethical distros.
        In fact, I am not in a position to judge them on other criteria:
        even to try them all would be a lot work of that I have no need to do.



    </p><h2>What I do on my computer</h2>
    <p>
        Mostly I use a text console, for convenience's sake.  Most of
        my work is editing text and that is more efficient on a text
        console. On the text console, the touchpad can't cause me any
        trouble if I touch it by accident.

    </p><p>
        I do use X11 for tasks that need a graphical interface.
        I have no preferred graphical environment or window manager.
        Since my interest in using graphical environments is small,
        I don't want to spend time comparing them.

    </p><p>
        This is not an ethical issue, just my own personal preference.  On
        the ethical level, I think it is important for free software to
        provide convenient free graphical user interface software, which is
        why the GNU Project launched three projects to develop that.  The
        third, <a href="http://gnome.org/">GNOME</a>, was successful, so we
        never needed a fourth one.

    </p><p>
        I spend most of my time editing in Emacs.  I read and send mail with
        Emacs using M-x rmail and C-x m.  I have no experience with any
        other email client programs.  In principle I would be glad to know
        about other free email clients, but learning about them is not a
        priority for me and I don't have time.

    </p><p>
        I edit the pages on this site with Emacs also, although volunteer
        helpers install the political notes and urgent notes.
        I have no experience with other ways of maintaining web sites.
        In principle I would be glad to know about other ways, but learning
        about them is low priority for me and I have other things to do.



    </p><h2>How this site is maintained</h2>
    <p>
        This site is maintained in a very simple way.  I edit the pages such
        as this one manually as HTML.  I only know simple HTML; others who
        know more wrote the parts at the top and bottom of pages, and the
        more complex formatting on the home page.  Volunteer helpers install
        the political notes every day after receiving the text from me by
        email.  A cron job "rolls over" the political notes page every two
        months.  The photo galleries are generated with <a href="http://www.netpurgatory.com/downloads.html#thumbnail">this
        perl script</a>.  The search feature on the site is done with

        An <a href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/RUE/">
        explanation of the concept of designing</a> a "user experience"
        which also shows why I find it loathsome.
        This is why I want stallman.org to remain simple: not a "user
        experience" but rather a place where I present certain information,
        views and action opportunities to you.

    </p><h2>How I use the Internet</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                I have used the Internet since it first existed.
                I never used UUCP, though occasionally I sent emails to
                addresses that involved transmission via UUCP.

        </p></li>
        <li>
            <div><p>
                I am careful in how I connect to the internet.
                </p><p>
                Specifically, I refuse to connect through portals that would
                require me to identify myself, or to run any nontrivial
                <a href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">nonfree
                Javascript code</a>.  I use <a href="https://gnu.org/software/librejs/">LibreJS</a> to prevent nonfree Javascript code from running..

	    </p></div><p>
	        I don't mind giving an identity that isn't
                really me, in order to connect, if that works.

            </p><p>
                I often connect in a person's home.  The <em>person</em>
                of course knows who I am, but that does not bother me.  What I
                would object to is putting my identity in a database that can be
                searched.  I prevent that by changing my mac address at each
                location.

        </p></li>
        <li>
            <div>
                <p><a name="internetuse">I am careful in how I use the Internet</a>.
                </p><p>
                I generally do not connect to web sites from my own machine,
                aside from a few sites I have some special relationship with.
                I usually fetch web pages from other sites by sending mail to a
                program (see https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/womb/hacks.git)
                that fetches them, much like wget, and then mails them back to
                me.  Then I look at them using a web browser, unless it is easy
                to see the text in the HTML page directly.  I usually try lynx
                first, then a graphical browser if the page needs it
                (using konqueror, which won't fetch from other sites in such a
                situation).

            </p></div><p>
                I occasionally also browse unrelated sites using IceCat via Tor.
                Except for rare cases, I do not identify myself to them. I think
                that is enough to prevent my browsing from being connected with
                me. IceCat blocks tracking tags and most fingerprinting methods.

            </p><p>
                I never pay for anything on the Web, because I cannot
		pay anonymously.  Anything on the net that requires
		payment that would identify me, I don't do.  (I made
		an exception for the fees for the stallman.org domain,
		since that is connected with me anyway.)

	    </p><p>
	        I avoid
		paying with <a href="https://stallman.org/rms-lifestyle.html#cards">
		credit cards</a> generally.  For freedom's sake, insist on
		paying cash.  When a business pressures you to pay in
		an identified way, it's your chance to defend freedom by
		saying, "If you won't take my cash, no sale!"

        </p></li>
        <li>
            <p>
                I would not mind paying for a copy of <a href="https://stallman.org/ebooks.pdf">an
                e-book</a> or <a href="https://stallman.org/internet-music.html">music recording</a>
                on the Internet if I could do so anonymously, and it treated me
		justly in other ways (no DRM or EULA).  But that option almost
                never exists. I keep looking for ways to make it exist.

        </p></li>
        <li>
            <p>
                For searching, I have mostly used DuckDuckGo for the past
                few years.  It does work with JS disabled, but you have
                to follow a link before you search.

            </p><p>
                I also sometimes use ixquick.com.  My usual
                precautions should stop them from knowing it is me.

            </p><p>
                I no longer use Google search, not even occasionally, because
                it sends me a broken CAPTCHA.  I suspect the reason it tries to
                send me a CAPTCHA is that I am coming through Tor.
                I would answer the CAPTCHA if that worked, but it does not.

            </p><p>
                I suspect that the reason the CAPTCHA is broken is that it
                depends on nonfree Javascript.  I won't run that in my computer.
                I am not willing to let Google see where I am, so I won't bypass
                Tor. Therefore, I can't use Google search any more.

        </p></li>
    </ul>

                That doesn't mean I think they are all unethical.  Some are,
                some are not. Social networking sites raise their own set of

                    <h3 id="geo-spatial-correlation">Geo-Spatial Correlation</h3><p>Geo-spatial autocorrelation refers to the degree to which one object is similar to other nearby objects. “Auto” means self and “correlation” means association. In layman terms, it measures how close objects are similar to other close objects.</p><blockquote>The first rule of GIS: Everything is related to everything else. But near things are more related than distant things (Waldo R. Tobler , 1970)</blockquote><h4 id="to-understand-this-law-let-s-take-an-example-">To understand this law, let’s take an example.</h4><p>Suppose you randomly picked up a house from a listing website like <a href="https://housing.com/" rel="noopener">Housing</a> and let's assume that the price of the house is $600K. Next, let's say the house just next to it is also listed for sale and you are to predict it’s the price. You are given two options $650K and $2.8M, which one would you pick?</p><p>If you picked $600K, then you already subconsciously know what spatial autocorrelation is. It is the correlation between two nearby objects in some common features (<em>for example house prices</em>).</p><p>A potential application of spatial auto-correlation is that it helps in analyzing clusters and dispersion of ecology and diseases. Questions such as “<em>Is the disease an isolated case</em>” or “<em>Is the rainfall pattern clustered or same across places</em>” can be well understood and answered with spatial autocorrelation analysis.</p><hr><h3 id="technical-definition">Technical Definition</h3><p>Technically, spatial auto-correlation refers to the measure of association between observation of variables that are close to each other at a spatial scale. The variable could be:</p><p>1. at any point on a continuous surface (such as land-use type or annual precipitation level in a region)</p><p>2. at a set of fixed sites in a particular region (such as a set of retail outlets)</p><p>3. &nbsp;across a set of areas that subdivide a region (such as count or proportion of the household which have two or more cars in a Census data that divide an urban region).</p><p>Autocorrelation violates the core principles of statistics, that is, observations are independent of each other. As per assumptions of independence in classical statistics , <em>observations between groups </em>and <em>observation within groups</em> should be independent . Hence , spatial autocorrelation clearly violates the above mentioned assumptions .</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/03/0_b489Z6tejMkolJ2W.jpg"><figcaption>Photo by Patrick Assalé on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="photo-source noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote>The concept of spatial correlation is a kind of extension of temporal correlation. The only difference being that temporal correlation measures the change of a variable over time while spatial correlation measures the change of two variables — observation (values like income, rainfall, etc) and location.</blockquote><h3 id="types-of-spatial-correlation">Types of Spatial Correlation</h3><p>The most common forms of spatial correlation across geospatial space are patches and gradients.</p><p>Spatial correlation in a variable can be <em>exogenous</em> (caused by another spatially auto-correlated variable like rainfall) or <em>endogenous</em> (caused by some process at play like the spread of a disease).</p><p>Here’s a video which talks in detail about how spatial autocorrelation helps in the importance<strong> </strong>of spatial autocorrelation.</p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k-emjdYiOQw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-emjdYiOQw">Source</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="moran-s-i"><strong>Moran’s I</strong></h3><p>Spatial auto-correlation is measured by Moran’s I. Moran’s I is a correlation coefficient used to measure the overall spatial correlation in your data set. &nbsp;Moran I’s can be classified as positive, negative and no spatial autocorrelation:</p><h4 id="1-positive-correlation-"><strong>1. Positive correlation</strong>:</h4><p>Spatial correlation is positive when similar values cluster together on a map. Positive autocorrelation occurs when Moran I is close to +1. The image below shows the land cover in an area and it is an example of a positive correlation since similar clusters are nearby.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/03/1_lK9g67hwjqppv4Ko8JoXoQ.png"><figcaption>Land cover image depicting the positive correlation</figcaption></figure><h4 id="2-negative-correlation-">2. <strong>Negative correlation</strong>:</h4><p>Spatial correlation is negative when dissimilar values cluster together on a map. A negative spatial autocorrelation occurs when Moran’s I value is -1. A checkerboard is a good example of negative auto-correlation because dissimilar values are next to each other.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/03/1_DXBMydyxEuTDLO-lRSi3CQ.png"><figcaption>Dissimilar objects cluster together hence the negative correlation</figcaption></figure><h4 id="2-zero-correlation-">2. Zero correlation:</h4><p>A Moran’s I value of 0 denotes no spatial autocorrelation.</p><h3 id="applications-of-spatial-correlation">Applications of Spatial Correlation</h3><p>The importance of spatial autocorrelation is that it helps to define how important spatial characteristic is in affecting a given object in space and if there is a clear relationship of objects with spatial properties. Here are some of the interesting industrial use cases of spatial autocorrelation:</p><ol><li><strong>Measure of Inequality: </strong>Spatial autocorrelation helps find out the measure of inequality and diversity be it in terms of income, population or race. It analyzes whether the parameters like income, population are clustered or uniformly distributed in a certain region using Moran’s I coefficient. [<a href="https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6068954/" rel="noopener">Source</a>]</li><li><strong>Environment</strong>: Spatial autocorrelation helps to spot contamination hotspots of rare earth elements in urban soils. [<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/spatial-autocorrelation-neighbors-affecting-neighbors-ed4fab8a4aac" rel="noopener">Source</a>]</li><li><strong>Points of Interest:</strong> Autocorrelation is used to map different parameters as a function of distance for variables of interest. For example, how far away from the city center do the house prices actually start decreasing</li><li><strong>Ecology</strong>: Spatial autocorrelation is used widely in the ocean and coral reef ecosystem for important applications like site suitability analysis to pinpoint areas for mussel longline farm or marine aquaculture planning.</li><li><strong>Demographics</strong>: Spatial autocorrelation is used to map and analyze voter turnout during elections For example, spatial autocorrelation was used to map absenteeism during the French Presidential election and French Regional election.

This study is a reproduction of the paper <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229866917_Analyzing_Migration_Phenomena_with_Spatial_Autocorrelation_Techniques" rel="noopener">here</a>. The case here takes into consideration the analysis of the migration of the foreign population in Italy.</p><p>Migration is a key factor in population dynamics evolutions at different scales, with implications in economy, culture, and environment. Using spatial autocorrelation, we identify spatial clusters representative of the concentration of migrants.</p><p>Technically, the Moran I coefficient’s here represents the difference between the weighted variance of the ratio of the foreign and local resident population and the generalized variance. In layman terms, it expresses the correlation between the <em>ratio of foreign/population</em> in a given place and the <em>ratio of foreign/population</em> in the neighboring spatial unit.</p><p>Using a correlation index <a href="http://www.dpi.inpe.br/cursos/ser301/referencias/bivand/node9.html" rel="noopener">LISA</a> (Local Indicator of Spatial Association), we segregated the scenarios into five kinds :</p><p>1. Locations with high values of the phenomenon and high level of similarity with its surroundings (high-high) defined as <em>hot-spots</em></p><p>2. Locations with low values of the phenomenon and low levels of similarity with its surroundings (low-low) defined as <em>cold-spots.</em></p><p>3. Locations with high values of the phenomenon and low levels of similarity or vice-versa. These are known as <em>spatial outliers.</em></p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/03/1_mOPoSDMvhVTAsS4b_WSMtg.png"><figcaption><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-12156-2_5">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>The areas where the migrating population inhibited could be divided into three clusters as follows :</p><ol><li>The first cluster was geographically concentrated in the north-eastern areas represented the values of positive correlation (type: high-high). Such groups were characterized by increasing income opportunities /welfare and hence attracted foreigners looking for employment.</li><li>The second cluster was found in the central region and represented values of positive correlation (type: high-high). The areas showed similar characteristics of greater welfare.</li><li>The third cluster was found in towns of Southern Italy (type: low-low). The areas were typically characterized by low incomes and fewer employment opportunities.</li></ol><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>Spatial autocorrelation not only clusters similar objects with other similar objects but also speaks about the degree of correlation or similarity. It is helpful in finding hidden patterns and relations.

If I take a jug of water and pour water into this glass, I'm <em>depositing </em>water into it. After I've done that, I might say there is a 'water deposit' in the glass.</p><p>Admittedly we don't often use that phrase to talk about water, but think for example of a geological metal deposit: in the beginning of the earth asteroids crashed and <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/12/101209-asteroid-collisions-earth-gold-science-space/">'deposited' debris</a> all over the planet, while volcanos 'deposited' lava, which nowadays leads us to discover 'cobalt deposits', ‘gold deposits’ or ‘iron ore deposits’.</p><p>Notice that the verb ‘deposit’ creates a <em>noun</em> of the same name: the exploding volcano 'deposits iron deposits', or the jug 'deposits a water deposit' into the glass.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!-- Begin Mailchimp Signup Form -->




<!--End mc_embed_signup--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Following this linguistic convention, then, we are prone to thinking that we 'deposit a bank deposit'. Surely - much like the water we have poured into the glass - 'bank deposit' refers to money we have 'poured into’ the bank. Indeed, that's what reputable sources like the Merriam-Webster Dictionary say: according to them, a bank 'deposit' is 'money deposited in a bank'.</p><p>But they are totally wrong.</p><figure><img src="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png 600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png 1000w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png 1600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png 1749w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>(Note: This is a composite website screenshot that has been edited for simplicity)</figcaption></figure><h3 id="unhitch-the-linguistic-glitch">Unhitch the Linguistic Glitch</h3><p>To understand 'bank deposits' you need to unhitch the verb from the noun. Let's illustrate this through the metaphor of a glass with water. If we imagine that the glass is the bank, the traditional mythology is that I pour (deposit) water (money) into it, after which the bank is 'storing' this 'deposit' for me. This is the mistake. The bank does not store my water for me. Rather they <em>take ownership</em> of my water - it is no longer mine - after which they issue me a promise for it. Imagine them taking out a piece of paper and writing ‘I owe you 100ml of water’. They hand it to me, <em>issuing </em>it out.</p><p>This promise they hand out to me is my 'deposit'.</p><figure><img src="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Water-Deposit.png" alt="" srcset="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Water-Deposit.png 600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Water-Deposit.png 1000w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Water-Deposit.png 1033w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A 'water deposit'</figcaption></figure><p>So, as a <em>noun</em>, 'bank deposits' are not the 'thing put into banks'. They are the <em>thing issued out </em>by banks.</p><p>I illustrate this in <a href="https://youtu.be/mmWOO7r_NMw?t=654">this Youtube video</a> by asking the viewer to imagine going into a casino with cash: you approach the cashier and hand the cash over in order to get <em>casino chips</em>. Those chips are a form of private currency that only works internal to the casino, and are <em>issued out</em> by the casino in response to <em>money put in</em>. Banks, similarly, <em>issue out </em>digital chips when we <em>put in </em>money. Those digital chips are the units we see 'in our bank account', but really our 'bank account' is just a record of what the bank has <em>issued out </em>to us. These outwardly-orientated digital chips are then called 'bank deposits' (or - sometimes - 'bank money', or M1), in contrast to the state money (or 'reserves', or M0), that gets 'put in'. </p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s77uGv4ezTw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>This article can also also be seen in YouTube form!</figcaption></figure><p>Confusingly, both the <em>thing put in</em>, and the <em>thing issued out</em> are called 'money' - if I 'pay by cash' I'm using state money, but if I '<a href="https://youtu.be/aem0rvvPKMQ">pay by card</a>' I'm using bank money, but in both scenarios I'll coloquially say 'I used money to pay'. To return to our water metaphor, this is like calling both water and a promise for water, 'water'). The accurate way to refer to 'paying by card' is to say 'paying by bank deposit transfer', which is the banking equivalent of using a casino chips to pay for something.</p><h3 id="promises-for-the-treasure-chest">Promises for the treasure chest</h3><p>I do not know the etymology of the noun 'bank deposit', but I'm guessing the confusion it creates emerges from a shortening of a term like 'deposit slip'. Imagine the following diary entry, perhaps coming from a 19th century merchant trying out a bank for the first time: </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>"Today I deposited all my state money into Barclays bank. The clerk issued me a deposit receipt, recognising that I had handed over ownership of my money to them, but promising me that I could come reclaim it. This slip - with its promise - is now my money."</p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Nowadays these 'deposit receipts' are digital chips, and the 'receipt' part has been dropped, shortening the term to 'deposit'. This slippage has caused the verb and noun to diverge from their traditional English-language pairing, but the 'outward-facing receipt' nature of deposits is easily confirmed by looking at a bank balance sheet. Here's one from Barclays:</p><figure><img src="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Deposit-Balance-Sheet-2-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Deposit-Balance-Sheet-2-1.png 600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Deposit-Balance-Sheet-2-1.png 1000w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Deposit-Balance-Sheet-2-1.png 1131w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>If deposits were ‘in’ the bank, they would be in the <em>assets</em> section on top. The assets section is like a record of the bank's ‘treasure chest’, with the things it <em>owns</em>. Notice, however, that 'deposits' are actually located in the <em>liabilities </em>section of the balance sheet, which records the promises that the bank has made (against the backdrop of the things it has in its 'treasure chest'), such as ‘we promise to pay you bondholders in two years’, or ‘we promise you state money on demand’. This latter promise is the ‘deposits’, and they are not ‘inside the glass’, because the glass is in the assets section.</p><h3 id="dispelling-the-deposit-myth-from-fractional-reserve-">Dispelling the deposit myth from 'fractional reserve'</h3><p>But it gets better. Do you notice that 'deposits' on the liabilities side of Barclays balance sheet far exceed the 'cash and balances at central bank' category in their assets section? In our water metaphor, this means 'the promises for water we've issued out far exceeds the water in our glass'.</p><p>This is a result of what is sometimes called 'fractional reserve banking' (albeit I use the term 'credit creation of money')</p><p>Fractional reserve banking is a favourite bogeyman for bank critics to attack, but it's frequently misrepresented due to our misunderstanding about the nature of deposits. Let me explain.</p><p>If you start from the assumption that a deposit is a ‘thing inside the bank’, rather than a ‘thing issued out by the bank’, you will be prone to explaining fractional reserve banking as follows: </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>‘I deposit money into the bank, but they then secretly give it away to someone else whilst telling you it is still there’</p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>If this is you, you've made an error, and have fallen into the trap of thinking that banks 'lend out the water that I've put inside them'. This also means you've failed to make a distinction between the two forms of money in our society: state money ('water'), and bank money ('promise for water'). And both of these misunderstandings are facilitated by the linguistic glitch we are trying to deprogram. </p><p>To accurately rewire your understanding, you must start from the recognition that your money ('bank deposits') is <em>issued out</em> by banks. The bank issues out promises for water in the glass, <em>but</em> - and this is crucial - they can issue out many more promises for water than they actually have. There is no process of them 'sneaking away water to give to someone else'. They don't touch the water. All they do is increase the number of promises they issue for it. Given that these bank promises are called deposits, it follows that deposits can be issued - and thereby expand - even if nothing was ‘deposited’. </p><p>But why would banks do that? Well, because they issue these short-term promises to extract more valuable long-term promises from the people they issue the short-term promises to. Those long-term promises end up in the assets section of the balance sheet, in that section called 'loans'. Yes, a loan is not 'water from the bank'. It is 'short-term promises for water from the bank, in exchange for long-term promises for water from you'.</p><p>Yes, banks can create assets by issuing liabilities, which is a more complex topic for another article, but if I had to adapt the water metaphor, I'd say something like <em>'when banks issue out excess promises for water in the glass, they conjur into being a portfolio of ghostly ice-statues that will attract melt-water towards the glass'...</em></p><p>That metaphor probably needs some work, but it's a good place to start.</p><h3 id="update-the-dictionary">Update the dictionary</h3><p>The verb-noun glitch creates all manner of weird anomalies when you start to play with it. For example, if I do indeed insist on 'depositing a bank deposit' it will in fact disappear, because - using our rewired understandings of those terms - that would actually mean 'handing back to the bank its own promises'. Incidentally, this is actually what happens when you 'repay a loan'. You are literally destroying bank money.</p><p>If that is too complex, don't worry. I'll make more articles and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/brettscott">money mythbusting videos</a> about this, with new metaphors.</p><p>I'll close, finally, with a suggestion for you Merriam-Webster, because I'm guessing you haven't updated this since 1828...</p><figure><img src="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png 600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png 1000w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png 1600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png 1749w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>In order to avoid the time-consuming job of dealing with the spambots and fraudsters who troll comments sections, I've decided to try something different.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p><small><em>Tue, 21 Jul 2020 21:37:19 +0200</em></small></p>

<p>Many browsers today are gigantic resource hogs, which are basically
VMs for various web applications. On the other hand, <a href="http://links.twibright.com/">Links</a> is a HTML
browser. It is not able to do everything. It allows me to avoid most
distractions and control the content-experience. The goal of this
exercise is not to force anyone to use this browser, but just to be
watchful and conscious of their hypertext based internet usage (one
might use gopher, and this phlog is available there, but probability
tells me that a person reading this reads this from hypertext source
and I am sure they are lovely).</p>

<h2>How?</h2>

<p>I use links compiled with X11 support and with <a href="https://gist.github.com/lich-tex/4795eeccf9b4e9ae21c94a65f7527ff2">Xembed patch</a> for
<a href="https://tools.suckless.org/tabbed/">tabbed</a>. I execute it using <a href="https://github.com/lich-tex/scriptsanddotfiles/blob/master/bin/glinks">a script</a>, and then I use <a href="https://github.com/lich-tex/scriptsanddotfiles/blob/master/bin/dsurfraw">surfraw with
dmenu</a> to have a uniform search function and bookmarks that work with
all my browsers. That is all you need to know. Interesting trivia:
Julian Assange made surfraw. Huh.</p>

<h2>CSS</h2>

<p>First, I want to focus on ‘destruction’ of CSS. As Links does not
support modern CSS it renders most of the internet as-is, and will
only contain images (on which I will write later). CSS causes the
internet to become a baroque set of arbitrary design decisions, and
does not contribute positively to the general experience. Links (after
2.19) allows me to pick my own font, my own background/foreground/url
color. Thus, I have a uniform experience. In that I already visibly
save time/energy/brain processing power, etc. To deal with senselessly
complex sites (news pages with &gt;1 MB JS, I am looking at you) I use
and <a href="https://flak.tedunangst.com/post/miniwebproxy">tedu’s miniwebproxy</a>. It delimits the content even more, and
removes elements that are not of interest for me (top,bottom,side
bars, recommended content, etc.).</p>

<h2>JS</h2>

<p>JS is the main cause for the way internet changed, for better or
worse. It changed content into dissimilar applications. It allowed for
measurement of attention and penalization of the experience. I am
critical of that, and Links has no JS support. Perfect. Nothing more
to be spoken of. If I need JS I will use another browser which
emulates anything Google considers good internet experience. But, that
<em>currently</em> is not my goal.</p>

<h2>Images</h2>

<p>Now, going from a little controversy to a giant controversy. Images (in the
modern web) are uninformative, but are simply advertisements of
content. They are made to take over your attention and again, make the
experience less uniform. Links does not force you to disable images
(as there are cases when they are useful - i.e. Wikipedia), but has a
function to not load them. Again, as with everything it allows for
more uniformity.</p>

<h2>Sad facts</h2>

<p>The word attempt is key here, and primarily I use it for Wikipedia
articles, directed searches (with surfraw), browsing youtube
through <a href="https://invidio.us/">invidio.us</a>, browsing twitter through <a href="https://nitter.net/">nitter.net</a>, but sadly
majority of my usage still ends up in a Chrome-like (that includes
Firefox). But writing and thinking like this allows to see what are
the issues with the modern web and how they can be approached. Using Links
is a radical solution, but as with many <a href="https://www.rationalwalk.com/via-negativa-wisdom-through-subtraction/">via negativa</a> solutions, they
teach us what are the things that are needed for valuable UX.</p>

<h2>Should I?</h2>

<p>I think trying is great. I have not explained how to do it, cause the
task of that is manpages and other analysis to get to know your wanted
experience, and not the wanted experience of someone else. Although,
it just maybe a continuation of a liberal dream of ability to control
your own consumer experience. The reality is you never have to, as
there is no possibility of changing the entire <em>internet</em> for better,
but you might find things that you can make better. Or only not worse.
You can also try out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">gopher</a>, but it is much more radical experience.</p>

            <p>If you are a Node.js developer, using npm packages won’t be a new concept to you. From complex npm packages like express to simple packages, npm hosts a large number of Node.js libraries that simplify the workload of Node developers. But have you ever thought about publishing a Node library of your own to help fellow developers? In today’s tutorial, we are going through the steps you have to follow when publishing your own Node.js library using npm.</p>
<h2 id="before-we-begin">Before we begin…</h2>
<p>Before we begin this, you should have the following things set up.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub account</a></li>
<li>Node.js and npm installed (<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm">Installation steps</a>)</li>
<li>An <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm account</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have all of the above set up, let’s get to publishing the library.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we are creating a simple library that converts a sentence to title case (in which the first letter of every word is capitalized).</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="choose-a-package-name">Choose a package name</h2>

</figure>

<p>When choosing a name for the npm package, you have to check whether the name is available on the official <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm website</a>. Your package name should be unique if you are publishing it as an unscoped (public) package.</p>
<p>However, if the package is scoped, or private, the package name does not have to be unique and the name takes the format of @username/package-name. You can find out more about scoped packages <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/using-npm/scope.html#:~:text=Scoped%20packages%20can%20be%20published,registries%20at%20the%20same%20time.">here</a>.</p>
<p>The name of the package we are going to create is “title-case-converter”.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="create-a-github-repository">Create a GitHub repository</h2>
<p>Create a new repository named “title-case-converter” in GitHub. Make sure to initialize the repository with a README. Choose an appropriate license like the MIT license as well.</p>

This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install &lt;pkg&gt;` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

<p>Note how we are using the version 1.0.0 for this package. This is the version we should use for the initial version of a package published to npm.</p>
<p>Npm uses a versioning system called Semantic Versioning (SemVer). The default starting version is 1.0.0. In future updates of your package, there are three types of version changes you can make following SemVer standards. These 3 are named patch, minor, and major.</p>
<ol>
<li>MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,</li>
<li>MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and</li>
<li>PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.</p>
<p>You can read more about SemVer versioning <a href="https://semver.org/">here</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="create-the-node-module">Create the Node module</h2>
<p>Now we can implement our package, title-case-converter.</p>
<p>Create a file named <code>app.js</code> (or whichever you set as your entry point) and add the following code to it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>converter</span>(<span>sentence</span>){
    <span>let</span> <span>capitalized</span> <span>=</span> []

    <span>return</span> <span>converted</span>
}

<span>module</span>.<span>exports</span> <span>=</span> <span>converter</span>
</code></pre></div><p>It contains a single function called <code>converter</code>, which accepts a string sentence and capitalizes the first letter of every word in it. The most important part of the above code is exporting the created function using <code>module.exports</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="initialize-git">Initialize Git</h2>
<p>Now, we are going to initialize git for our project using the command <code>git init</code>. Then, stage the files we changed, using the following command.</p>
<p>In the next step, commit the changes of code to the local repository.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">git commit -m "initial changes"
</code></pre></div><p>After this, we have to add the GitHub repository as the project’s remote repository.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">git remote add origin &lt;GitHub repository URL&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Pull the changes from the remote repository and then push the local changes to it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">git pull origin master
git push origin master
</code></pre></div><hr>
<h2 id="write-a-good-readme-file-for-the-package">Write a good README file for the package</h2>
<p>Including a good README is crucial when publishing an npm package. It gives the other users the basic rundown of what your package does and how they can use it in their projects.</p>
<p>You can find a template to create a good README <a href="https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2">here</a>. To get a better idea about how your README should look, you can browse popular npm packages and GitHub repositories to see how others have done it.</p>
<p>Generally, a README should cover the following fields.</p>
<ul>
<li>A small description of what your package does.</li>
<li>How another user can install the package to use it in their project.</li>
<li>How to use the package in a project. Provide code examples explaining the usage.</li>
<li>How to contribute to your package. If you expect other open-source developers to contribute to this project, this field is a must-add to the README file.</li>
<li>The license used by the package. For this package, we used the MIT license.</li>
</ul>
<p>After these changes don’t forget to commit and push.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="publish-the-package-to-npm">Publish the package to npm</h2>
<p>Even though the concept of publishing a library feels like a lot of work when you first hear about it, this step is surprisingly simple. All you have to do is run the following command in your command-line.</p>
<p>If you chose a package name that doesn’t clash with existing npm packages, this step should go smoothly and in a matter of seconds, your first package will be published to npm.</p>
<p>Now you can create a new Node.js project and install your new package as a dependency using this command.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">npm install title-case-converter --save
</code></pre></div><p>Then, you can import the package to the new project and use it to convert sentences to the title-case as you wish.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>converter</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span>(<span>"title-case-converter"</span>)

<span>let</span> <span>convertedSentence</span> <span>=</span> <span>converter</span>(<span>"my name is juan"</span>) <span>//"My Name Is Juan"
</span></code></pre></div><p>That’s it! You are now a proud owner of a published npm package.</p>
<p>You can try your hand at creating a more complex Node.js module and publish it to npm after this.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As you may of have expected publishing an NPM package is a simple task, and you don’t always need to follow the same steps in the same order like it was explained in this tutorial. You can assign the author, or make modifications to the package name or any other attributes later on by using npm commands or simply editing the <code>package.json</code> file.</p>
<p>I hope you learned something new today, and as always, thanks for reading!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>We built Repl.it to make it easy to explore and learn languages and programming paradigms. We’ve grown a community that, like us, is <a href="https://repl.it/talk/ask/Wildest-programming-language-idea/42923">excited</a> by languages. We were, however, surprised by how slow-moving the programming language space seems to be. Given how fast software is growing, shouldn’t we see more innovation in programming languages?</p>
<p>We can think of a programming language as either a tool built to be good at a software domain or as a medium for thought and expression. If languages are indeed tools, then some languages would be better than others for a given task. For example, if I want to build a web server with reliable performance, I might use Golang because it has a solid standard library and concurrency primitives. Whereas, if I'm making a UI, I might want to use JavaScript for its first-class support for event-driven programming. On the other hand, if we think about languages as mediums of expression, choosing a language becomes less about objective qualities and more about aesthetics and ergonomics. </p>
<p>But if languages are tools, shouldn't we see many more language variations to cover the ever-increasings niches that software is entering? Similarly, if languages are mediums of thought, and there are more and more people interested in expressing themselves digitally, shouldn't we expect to see many more types of languages?</p>
<p>One answer could be that programmers are not that interested in thinking about languages. Or that our languages today are sufficient and everyone is happy. But spend a few minutes on any programming forum, and it’ll become clear that a lack of enthusiasm and opinions on languages could not be the reason why we don’t see more programming languages.</p>
<p>Programming languages are undoubtedly hard to make. They require a combination of design skills and technical chops. But for some reason, language designers are typically solo hackers. But what if we made programming languages easier to make? If we showed that it is possible for anyone, even those with limited experience, perhaps especially beginners, can create and experiment with languages? Wouldn’t we get a lot more exciting and fresh ideas?</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/jam.png" alt="language jam"></p>
<p>Well, here at Repl.it, we specialize in making hard things accessible, and we want to make creating programming languages easier, fun, exciting, and collaborative. Today, we're announcing the programming language jam and a $10,000 grant to a team that designs and prototypes a new language with emphasis on fresh and possibly wild ideas. The winning language will also get added to Repl.it, where anyone can quickly start using it to code. We’ll have prizes for individual category winners too.</p>
<p>The hackathon starts on <strong>August 10th</strong> and runs until <strong>August 31st</strong>. To enter, you have to create a Repl.it Team when registration opens with a minimum of two team members. <strong>Registration will open on August 1st</strong>. To be notified when registration opens, leave your email <a href="https://forms.gle/x3n4cDYQzdvFvci57">here</a>.</p>
<p>Our Hackathon is judged by:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://maryrosecook.com/">Mary Rose Cook</a> whose language experimentation spans toy Lisp interpreters to programming environments for kids</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/jordwalke">Jordan Walke</a>, the creator of React.js and the Reason programming language</li>
<li>TBD: we're looking for more judges. Specifically people who are interested in wild programming language ideas</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<h3 id="can-anyone-participate">Can anyone participate?</h3>
<p>Yes! You don’t even need to have any prior experience making languages. To help you get started, we created these tutorials and templates:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://repl.it/talk/learn/Making-your-own-programming-language-with-Python/45767">Making your own programming language with Python</a></li>
<li><a href="https://repl.it/talk/learn/Making-your-own-programming-language-with-NodeJS/45779">Making your own programming language with NodeJS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here also also some links to other websites that can help you learn the basics of making your own languages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kanaka/mal/blob/master/process/guide.md">Make a Lisp</a></li>
<li><a href="https://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/little-lisp-interpreter">Little Lisp Interpreter</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-kind-of-language-should-it-be">What kind of language should it be?</h2>
<p>Any kind -- it could be dynamic, compiled, or whatever. We’re particularly interested in fresh ideas. So the only criteria are that it’s a language you can program in :)</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-get-if-i-win">What do I get if I win?</h2>
<p>You get $5,000 upfront, and $5,000 over two months to continue working on the language after the jam. We ask you to try to get to a usable version of the language to be added to Repl.it in three months after the jam.</p>
<h2 id="do-i-have-to-code-it-on-replit">Do I have to code it on Repl.it?</h2>
<p>During the jam, we ask all participants to code and submit their projects on Repl.it to make it easy for our judges to run your project, and for our users to interact and potentially fork and remix your language. We ask that you make one demo repl that it’s easy to run and try. </p>
<p>After the jam, it’s up to you where you want to finish coding the language. </p>
<h2 id="can-i-be-a-judge">Can I be a judge?</h2>
<p>Yes -- reach out to us on Twitter or email, and we’d be happy to chat. </p>
<h2 id="can-i-remix-or-improve-on-an-existing-language">Can I remix or improve on an existing language?</h2>
<p>Yes, as long as you're adding original ideas and putting an effort to meaningfully change or improve the language.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-make-a-domain-specific-language-dsl">Can I make a Domain Specific Language (DSL)?</h2>
<p>Yes. As long as the DSL deviates from the host language in constructs and syntax. For example GraphQL is useful/interesting on its own despite being embedded in JavaScript</p>
<h2 id="can-i-make-a-non-turing-complete-language">Can I make a non-turing complete language?</h2>
<p>Yes, as long as it's useful and not purely academic.</p>

<p>Build a live security test environment within a Travis CI build pipeline, and scan your applications for security vulnerabilities each time you check in code.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.stackhawk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stackhawk-travis-docker-1024x328.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.stackhawk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stackhawk-travis-docker-1024x328.png 1024w, https://www.stackhawk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stackhawk-travis-docker-300x96.png 300w, https://www.stackhawk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stackhawk-travis-docker-768x246.png 768w, https://www.stackhawk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stackhawk-travis-docker-1536x492.png 1536w, https://www.stackhawk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stackhawk-travis-docker-2048x655.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<p>Every time you commit and push software changes, you should be building and testing it for bugs. That includes security bug testing against a live integration environment, so you can be aware of any new bugs as they are introduced, and before they go to production. Here’s a step-by-step guide to accomplishing that in a fully automated way using <a href="https://www.stackhawk.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">StackHawk</a> and <a href="https://travis-ci.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis CI</a>.</p>



<p>In this tutorial, we will build and containerize an intentionally flawed Django app called <em>vuln_django</em>, based on the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial01/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Django Tutorial</a> series. We will stand up an integration environment complete with an Nginx front-end and a PostgreSQL database backend using Docker Compose. Finally, we will test our app for security vulnerabilities using StackHawk. And we will do all of this in a self-contained Travis CI build environment, triggered by pushes to GitHub.</p>



<h3>Getting Started</h3>



<p>You will need accounts with <a href="https://app.stackhawk.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">StackHawk</a>, <a href="https://travis-ci.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis CI</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub</a>. You will also need some familiarity with Git and Docker. Familiarity with Python and Django is helpful, but not necessary.</p>



<p>You should have the following software installed on your computer.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker Compose</a></li><li>Python 3 (`<a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">brew</a> install python` on MacOS)</li><li>All prerequisites for Python3 <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mysqlclient/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">mysqlclient</a> (`brew install mysql` on MacOS)</li><li>All prerequisites for Python3 <a href="https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">psycopg2</a> (`brew install postgres` on MacOS)</li></ul>



<h3>Fork and Clone vuln_django_play</h3>



<p>Fork a copy of the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/kaakaww/vuln_django_play" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vuln_django_play</a> repository to your own GitHub account. Then clone the fork to your workstation. This repo already contains all of the automation that we will be creating in this tutorial and more. Since that’s what we want to create, remove it by running the script, <code>delete-automation.sh</code>.</p>



<div><div>
<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;fileName&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">cd vuln_django_play
scripts/delete-automation.sh</pre></div>
</div></div>



<p>Now try running <em>vuln_django</em> locally to verify that it works.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;htmlmixed&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">python3 -m venv env&lt;br&gt;$ source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py seed polls --number=5
python manage.py test
python manage.py runserver</pre></div>



<p>Browse to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://127.0.0.1:8000/</a> and you should see the <em>vuln_django</em> polling application! The strange polls you see were generated in the <code>seed</code> step above, and the poll data is stored in a SQLite database that was created with the <code>migrate</code> step.</p>



<p>Hit <code>&lt;ctrl&gt;-c</code> to stop the development server.</p>



<h3>Containerize vuln_django</h3>



<p>Rather than running the development server, let’s run the app with <a href="https://gunicorn.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gunicorn</a> for better performance, and to better simulate a production environment. And for portability, let’s containerize it.</p>



<p>Create a Dockerfile at the base of your cloned repo with the following contents.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;dockerfile&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-dockerfile&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Dockerfile&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;docker&quot;}"># Create the base stage
FROM python:3.7-buster as base

COPY requirements.txt /opt/app/
COPY vuln_django/ /opt/app/vuln_django/vuln_django
COPY static/ /opt/app/vuln_django/static
COPY templates/ /opt/app/vuln_django/templates
COPY polls/ /opt/app/vuln_django/polls
COPY manage.py /opt/app/vuln_django/

RUN pip install -r /opt/app/requirements.txt

# Create the micro stage to run as a gunicorn container
FROM base as micro

<p>Build the container image and run it to make sure you get the same results as when you ran the app manually.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">docker build . --tag vuln_django:micro
docker run --rm --detach --publish 8010:8010 --name vuln-django vuln_django:micro
docker exec vuln-django python manage.py migrate
docker exec -it vuln-django python manage.py createsuperuser
docker exec vuln-django python manage.py seed polls --number=5
docker exec vuln-django python manage.py test</pre></div>



<p>Browse to the containerized app server at <a href="http://localhost:8010/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://localhost:8010/</a>, and once again you should see some polls. Go to <a href="http://localhost:8010/admin/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://localhost:8010/admin/</a> and log on with the superuser credentials you created, and check out the Django admin interface.</p>



<p>Notice how we ran migrations, seed data, and tests as <code>docker exec</code> commands. As before, those commands created a SQLite database file, this time within the container, and populated it with seed data.</p>



<p>Cool! Shut it down.</p>







<p>Since we used the <code>--rm</code> flag to <code>docker run</code>, the container goes away, along with all of its data. If you started it again, you would again need to run migrations, create the superuser, and seed the data for the app to work.</p>



<h3>Build a Docker Compose Configuration</h3>



<p>Let’s make this look more like a real application environment by assembling some supporting services in Docker Compose. We will add an Nginx container to host static files and forward requests to our app, and we’ll add a PostgreSQL database to host the polling data.</p>



<p>Create a file, <code>docker-micro.yml</code> and add the following contents:</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;yaml&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-yaml&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;YAML&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;yaml&quot;}">version: "3.7"

services:
  vuln-proxy:
    image: nginx
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf.micro:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
      - ./static:/opt/app/vuln_django/static:ro
    ports:
      - 8020:8020
    depends_on:
      - vuln-django

  vuln-django:
    image: vuln_django:micro
    build:
          context: .
          target: micro
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      - DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME=admin
      - DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=adminpassword
      - DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL=admin@example.com
      - SQL_ENGINE=django.db.backends.postgresql
      - SQL_HOST=db
      - SQL_PORT=5432
      - SQL_DATABASE=django_db
      - SQL_USER=django_user
      - SQL_PASSWORD=django_password

  db:
    image: postgres
    restart: always
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=django_db
      - POSTGRES_USER=django_user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=django_password
</pre></div>



<p>Notice that the <code>vuln-django</code> service requires the container image, <code>vuln_django:micro</code>. The <code>build</code> section specifies where to find the Dockerfile for <code>vuln_django:micro</code>, and which target stage to build. Recall we added a <em>micro</em> stage to the Dockerfile above.</p>



<p>Under <code>services.vuln-django.environment</code>, we populate several variables to tell the <code>vuln-django</code> service how to connect to its database, and how to create a superuser account for the Django Admin interface. Notice that SQL_HOST is set to <code>db</code>, which is the name of our PostgreSQL service defined in <code>services.db</code>.</p>



<p>The <code>db</code> service uses the official <code>postgres</code> image, and we configure the database, username, and passwords with environment variables.</p>



<p>Finally, the <code>vuln-proxy</code> service is an official Nginx container with a custom configuration <code>nginx.conf.micro</code>. This configuration serves custom static content from the <code>/static</code> directory, mounted as a volume from the <code>./static</code> directory in the project repo, and forwards all other requests to <code>http://vuln-django:8010</code>. We publish port <code>8020</code> as a convenience so that we can test this service locally.</p>



<p>Build and run this Docker Compose configuration.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml build
docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml up --detach</pre></div>



<p>Run migrations and setup as before, using docker-compose to <code>exec</code> the commands on the <code>vuln-django</code> service container.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml exec vuln-django python manage.py migrate
docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml exec vuln-django python manage.py createsuperuser --no-input
docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml exec vuln-django python manage.py seed polls --number=5
docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml exec vuln-django python manage.py test</pre></div>



<p>Now that the database has been configured and seeded, click around to see how it looks at <a href="http://localhost:8020/polls/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://localhost:8020/polls/</a>. You should see a new waving Pikachu in the background, since we are now serving extra static content from the Nginx proxy service.</p>



<p>Great! Now shut your stack down and remove all of the containers.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml down</pre></div>



<h3>Add Automation</h3>



<p>This is looking good, but there are a lot of steps to build this stack and run it. Let’s script what we have done so far.</p>



<p>Create a file in your project called <code>scripts/build-and-run.sh</code>, and add the following content.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Build and run vuln-django with Nginx and PostgreSQL
set -ex

# We'll use this `docker-compose exec` command a lot...
EXEC_CMD='docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml exec vuln-django'

# Build docker images, in particular the vuln-django container
docker-compose -f docker-micro.yml build

# Launch the app, PostgreSQL and Nginx
docker-compose -f docker-micro.yml up --detach

# Wait for the database, using netcat to ping it
echo Wait for database to become available...
while ! ${EXEC_CMD} bash -c 'nc -z "${SQL_HOST}" "${SQL_PORT}"'; do
  sleep 0.5
done
echo Database ready!

# Run database migrations to build tables
${EXEC_CMD} python manage.py migrate

# Create Django admin user from DJANGO_SUPERUSER_ environment variables
${EXEC_CMD} python manage.py createsuperuser --no-input

# Seed database with test data
${EXEC_CMD} python manage.py seed polls --number=5

# Run unit tests
${EXEC_CMD} python manage.py test</pre></div>



<p>Make the script executable.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">chmod 755 scripts/build-and-run.sh</pre></div>



<p>Now bring the whole stack up like so.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">./scripts/build-and-run.sh</pre></div>



<p>And again, tear it down.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml down</pre></div>



<p>Try that a few more times, and click around the app to make sure it all looks good.</p>



<h3>Add HawkScan</h3>



<p>Create a <code>stackhawk.yml</code> file and add the following content. Be sure to replace <code>&lt;STACKHAWK_APP_ID&gt;</code> with your own StackHawk application ID. Check your <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://app.stackhawk.com/applications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">app list</a> if you need to find or create one.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;yaml&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-yaml&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;YAML&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;yaml&quot;}">app:
  applicationId: &lt;STACKHAWK_APP_ID&gt;
  env: ${APP_ENV:Travis CI}
  host: ${HOST:http://localhost:8020}
  riskLevel: MEDIUM
  appDataType: PII
  antiCsrfParam: csrfmiddlewaretoken
  excludePaths:

<p>Let me tell you a story about the Enterprise Java Programmers from eBay.  When eBay was founded Java was <em>hot</em>.  Everyone was using Java.  If you were a <em>serious real programmer</em>, you did everything in Java.  I know because I got sucked into endless terrible Java projects up until 2008 when the banks collapsed and swirled around the economic toilet, taking the turd Enterprise Java with them.  People laugh, but the banks dying in 2008 is really what wiped out Enterprise Java as we know it and killed off <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_acquisition_by_Oracle">Sun</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently, in 2008 about 40-50% of Sun's money came from banks running Java.  When the banks collapsed because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis">mortgage backed securities fraud</a> a huge chunk of Sun's money evaporated practically overnight.  As smaller banks were absorbed into the three remaining larger banks the contractual obligations to Sun were canceled.  There was also a form of "guilt by association" because Java was associated with inflexible old systems that couldn't be changed fast enough to survive the 2008 crash.  I know this because I literally worked on one of these inflexible Java systems at Bear Stearns and watched this all unfold in real time in 2008.</p>
<p>I say Enterprise Java because Java continued on life support when Google/Android used it in their phones.  If it weren't for Android Java--the language--would have died the miserable death it deserved in 2008.  That's why I keep saying "Enterprise", because that version of Java was a special brand of obnoxious hell most programmers from then hate.  It was this bizarre infinitely indirect convoluted code that seemed to only exist to keep Enterprise Programmers in their jobs.  I remember to this day obnoxious "old beard" Java programmers who would brow beat you and harass you if you didn't wrap everything in an <code>AbstractFactoryIndirectFactoryFactory</code>.</p>
<p>This use of convoluted code full of <code>AbstractFactory</code> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth">shibboleths</a> did actually do its job of excluding new entrants to the industry and also keeping programmers employed.  You couldn't fire those Enterprise Java programmers because they were the only ones who knew that incredibly convoluted code to fix that bug once a year that weirdly showed up right about the time they were supposed to get bonuses.  You had to pay 8000 people a year to basically sit and watch a bunch of Java virtual machines do nothing or else one day (right before bonuses) these VMs would implode and you'd have nobody around to fix them.</p>
<p>The problem with the Enterprise Java Programmer (EJP) and their job protectionism is companies die, and when they do you need to find a new job.  You would think the collapse of 2008 would teach these programmers this lesson, but they did not learn it at all.  You'd think they'd realize no job is safe anymore, and that they need to always have a second language in their back pocket and a plethora of alternative projects just in case they need to jump off the burning ship.</p>
<p>Nope, and the programmers at eBay are an excellent example.</p>
<h2 id="e-bay-wised-up"><a href="https://learnjsthehardway.com/blog/07-your-side-projects-are-your-future#e-bay-wised-up">eBay Wised Up</a></h2>
<p>I used eBay a few times, and even in 2014 it still had old creaky garbage user interfaces.  When you did a checkout it would inject <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> tags back to its own services to show you simple things like...an invoice.  That might be fine here and there, but eBay was riddled with these iframe cockroaches.  Paypal (which was owned by eBay at the time) was nearly the same way, with terrible UIs all over and creaky infrastructure.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure the cause of this perpetual terrible UI was the EJPs and their job protective code.  In order to maintain their jobs they created a system that was difficult to change without their help.  That <em>also</em> makes the code difficult for <em>them</em> to change, so most likely when they're asked to "please make the UI modern", they claim its "impossible".  You'd ask if they can puhhleaze just use something like bootstrap, and the EJP will go look at their creaky old Java code with its hand coded HTML embedded in a <code>FactoryFactoryImplInterface</code> and say, "No that'd be impossible."</p>
<p>This impossibility was demonstrated as a lie.  Eventually Paypal was spun off on its own and <em>suddenly</em> their UI started to improve.  Paypal shared the same programmers as eBay, but after the spinoff they were able to fire those crotchety old EJPs and hire some better UI designers to improve the application.  Paypal had to do this because of competition from Stripe which was owning them in the developer market with nice UIs and documentation.</p>
<p>After Paypal showed you <em>could</em> improve this supposedly "impossible" code I believe it started a war within eBay that eventually culminated in eBay firing about 3000 Enterprise Java Programmers.  There's no official number, but the information I have from sources inside puts it at around 3000-8000 fired and the CTO trying to hire <em>anyone else</em> to improve the company.</p>
<p>Eventually companies like eBay either die, or get smart and realize that firing inflexible "impossible" programmers is the only way forward.  When you look at many of the banks from 2008, you can always find some piece of inflexible technology controlled by a programmer who thinks keeping it inflexible will save their job.  The irony of this attitude is that being inflexible eventually kills the company, costing them their job, but <em>also</em> makes it difficult for them to find work after.</p>
<p>The eBay programmers are excellent demonstrations of this effect.  Many of them couldn't even switch over to Android development.  I know many that switched over to non-programming jobs or just retired entirely.  Most of them didn't have anything else to show for their decades at eBay and had no ability to learn any new languages.  They had no potential side businesses to start, no additional demonstrations of skill, and no way to explain how they spent 20 years keeping  invoicing <code>AbstractInterfaceImpl</code> <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> Virtual Machine running.</p>
<h2 id="the-truths"><a href="https://learnjsthehardway.com/blog/07-your-side-projects-are-your-future#the-truths">The Truths</a></h2>
<p>A lot of the people who tell you not to code at home try to cast this viewpoint as some sort of proletariat revolt against the machinery of late capitalism.  I grew up extremely poor and I can tell you that none of these people have ever been truly poor.  People who are actually poor want to work, and know that you can lose everything in an instant so they do everything they can to keep working.  Work is not shameful or a sign that you're a loser.  Many people want to work and people saying they don't doesn't make them edgy or socialist.  It makes them privileged.</p>
<p>Anyone telling you to work <em>less</em> is <em>not</em> your friend.   The same goes for anyone shaming you for wanting to make more money.  Usually these people are privileged with a family or spouse who can take care of them. If they suddenly lose their job, they have an alternative degree and programming is just a minor stepping stone to something else, or they're just delusional and think they'll have their cushy job forever.  Their experience is completely different from mine and yours, so if you need to work, and you want to keep working in programming, then you definitely should ignore someone who has the luxury of learning one programming language to work at one company.</p>
<p>The truth is having side projects is <em>the main</em> way you build leverage against corporate greed.  It's harder to exploit someone who has options, and in my experience working on additional projects after work has given me far more benefit than any job has.  I can safely say that <em>everything</em> I learned over my career has been from the personal work I do, not from any job I've had.  I can also say that the most fun and enjoyment I've had in programming has been working on my own projects.</p>
<p>Therefore, I'm going to give you my list of true reasons that side projects benefit you as a programmer of any experience level.</p>
<h2 id="truth-0-side-projects-mean-freedom"><a href="https://learnjsthehardway.com/blog/07-your-side-projects-are-your-future#truth-0-side-projects-mean-freedom">Truth 0: Side Projects Mean Freedom</a></h2>
<p>To this day there's hordes of programmers who think it's a form of oppression to have to work on side projects, when the truth is side projects give you choice, and choice is freedom.  With additional code done outside of work in another language you can choose to leave when you find a better position in the new language.  You can also potentially turn these side projects into new businesses you own.</p>
<p>If all you do is work on your company's code you effectively become stuck in their particular brand of code and their way of doing things.  Unless that company is one of the FAANGs your experience is in many ways going to work against you when trying to find new work.  That's because (as I'll explain later), your version of a language is almost always totally weird and incompatible with all the other totally weird uses of that language.</p>
<p>The company you work for likes this situation because they know you'll never leave since you have lost your experience with new technology, and learning it is difficult.  You'll just sit there babysitting the JVM that keeps the cornflower blue buttons running and not try to find a job doing Go because that's harder.</p>
<p>You shouldn't think of your side projects as some kind of calling card that you reluctantly do so you can get a job after your big mega corp dies.  You should think of it as keeping your options open through training and study so that you are free to get a new job when you see one or need one.</p>
<h3 id="truth-1-you-never-get-a-raise"><a href="https://learnjsthehardway.com/blog/07-your-side-projects-are-your-future#truth-1-you-never-get-a-raise">Truth 1: You Never Get a Raise</a></h3>
<p>Why would you need to go get a new job if you're making decent money at a nice and easy job?  Because <em>companies never give programmers wages that match their impact</em>.  You might get a 2% raise a year, which is less than the inflation of your currency.  You might get a tiny bonus.  Meanwhile, your code will be the main reason your company makes billions and trillions of dollars.  You <em>might</em> be able to get some stock options, and that's about the only way you'll get a raise.  Ever.</p>

<h2>Technical details</h2>



<p>Developers can control the Neosensory Buzz vibrational motors over a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) wireless link to a host device (e.g. mobile phone, Arduino, etc.).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neosensory currently has software development kits (SDKs) available for <a href="https://github.com/neosensory/neosensory-sdk-for-android-java">Android</a> and <a href="https://github.com/neosensory/neosensory-sdk-for-bluefruit">Arduino Bluefruit-compatible</a> boards. Otherwise, our <a href="https://neosensory.com/developers/">API</a> is platform-agnostic, but will require additional Bluetooth-related legwork to get working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can see the Neosensory SDK for Android tutorial <a href="https://neosensory.com/blog/neosensory-sdk-for-android-example-project/">here</a> and our Arduino SDK tutorial <a href="https://neosensory.com/blog/neosensory-arduino-sdk-example-project/">here</a>. Check out <a href="https://neosensory.com/blog/">our blog</a> for example projects using both the SDKs for both Android and Arduino.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Before we start, let’s make sure we don’t confuse memoization and memorization. Memorization is when you put something in <em>your</em> head. It has the letter “r” in it.</p>
<p>But <em>memoization</em> (no “r”) is a nerdy computer science topic. Although in practice it also (unsurprisingly!) has to do with remembering things, there exist snobs who will hold it against you if you say “memorize” when you really mean “memoize”. I am not personally one of them, but you’ll need to keep this in mind for some job interviews.</p>
<p>Okay, if these are different things, then what <em>is</em> memoization?</p>
<h3><a href="#tldr" id="tldr">tl;dr</a></h3><p>To illustrate it, imagine you’re writing a JavaScript app that calculates the weather based on the atmosphere readings. You don’t know how to do it, but luckily, there is an npm package with a <code>getChanceOfRain</code> function that you can use from your code:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> getChanceOfRain </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'magic-weather-calculator'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"The chance of rain tomorrow is:"</span><span>,</span><span> result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>There is just one problem. No matter what you do, calling <code>getChanceOfRain()</code> takes 100 milliseconds. So if the user rage-clicks “Show me the weather!” button, the weather will have to be recalculated and the app will briefly freeze on every click:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span></p></code></pre><p>This is not ideal. In the real life, if you already knew the answer, you wouldn’t be calculating it over and over! You would reuse the result from your previous calculation. That’s what memoization is. <strong>Memoization means storing the result so you can use it next time instead of calculating the same thing again and again.</strong></p>
<p>In the below example, we call <code>memoizedGetChanceOfRain()</code> instead. This is a new function that we added which will check if we already have an answer — and if we do, it will return the previous answer instead of re-running <code>getChanceOfRain()</code>:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> getChanceOfRain </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'magic-weather-calculator'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> isCalculated </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> lastResult</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>memoizedGetChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>isCalculated</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> lastResult</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  lastResult </span><span>=</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  isCalculated </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>memoizedGetChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"The chance of rain tomorrow is:"</span><span>,</span><span> result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>This makes every call to <code>showWeatherReport()</code> except the first one instant:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span></p></code></pre><p>That’s what memoization is. When we say a function is “memoized”, it doesn’t mean we do something special to it from the JavaScript language perspective. It only means that we avoid calling it unnecessarily if we know its result won’t change.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>You can stop reading here, if you want.</strong> We’ll continue with a few extra details.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#memoization-and-parameters" id="memoization-and-parameters">Memoization and Parameters</a></h3><p>Generally, memoization always follows the same scheme:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check if we already have a result.</li><li>If yes, return it.</li><li>If no, calculate the result and store it for the next time.</li></ol>
<p>However, the actual implementation depends on our circumstances. For example, let’s say that the <code>getChanceOfRain</code> function takes a <code>city</code> parameter:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>function</span><span> </span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"The chance of rain tomorrow is:"</span><span>,</span><span> result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>If we naïvely memoized this function like we did before, we would introduce a bug:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'London'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span></p></code></pre><p>Do you see the bug yet? The weather in Tokyo and London might be very different, so we can’t safely reuse the previous answer. This means that <strong>when we memoize a function and reuse its result, we have to take its parameters into account too</strong>.</p>
<h4><a href="#solution-1-only-keep-the-last-result" id="solution-1-only-keep-the-last-result">Solution 1: Only Keep the Last Result</a></h4><p>The easiest solution to our example is to remember both the result <em>and</em> the parameters for which that result was calculated. Here is how we could do it:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> getChanceOfRain </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'magic-weather-calculator'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> lastCity</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> lastResult</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>memoizedGetChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>city </span><span>===</span><span> lastCity</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> lastResult</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  lastCity </span><span>=</span><span> city</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  lastResult </span><span>=</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>memoizedGetChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"The chance of rain tomorrow is:"</span><span>,</span><span> result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>Notice how this example is subtly different from our original one. Instead of <em>always</em> returning the last result when it exists, we check <code>city === lastCity</code> first. If the city changes midway, we’re going to have to re-calculate the result again:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'London'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'London'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span></p></code></pre><p>This fixes our bug, but it’s not always an optimal solution. In particular, if our <code>city</code> parameter changes on every function call, our memoization becomes useless:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'London'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'London'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span></p></code></pre><p>Whenever you add memoization, remember to check if it actually helps!</p>
<h4><a href="#solution-2-keep-many-results" id="solution-2-keep-many-results">Solution 2: Keep Many Results</a></h4><p>Another thing we could do is to keep <em>many</em> results instead of just the last one. Although we could define variables like <code>lastTokyoResult</code>, <code>lastLondonResult</code>, and so on, it is much easier to use a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Map</code></a> which lets us hold a result for every <code>city</code> value:</p>
<pre><code><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> resultsPerCity </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>Map</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>memoizedGetChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>resultsPerCity</span><span>.</span><span>has</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> resultsPerCity</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  resultsPerCity</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>,</span><span> result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>memoizedGetChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"The chance of rain tomorrow is:"</span><span>,</span><span> result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>This solution works great for our use case because it only ever calculates the result the first time it encounters a particular value of <code>city</code>. Every next call with the same <code>city</code> parameter will reuse the previously calculated result that we stored in our <code>Map</code>:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'London'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'London'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Paris'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span></p></code></pre><p>However, this solution isn’t without its downsides too. <strong>In particular, if we keep passing more different <code>city</code> values to our function, our <code>Map</code> will keep growing.</strong></p>
<p>So this solution trades faster performance for potentially unbounded memory growth. In the very worst cases, this can result in our browser tab crashing, especially if every result uses a significant part of memory (e.g. a DOM tree).</p>
<h4><a href="#other-solutions" id="other-solutions">Other Solutions</a></h4><p>There are many solutions on the spectrum between “keep only the last result” and “keep all results”. For example, you may keep results for the last N parameter values, which is known as an LRU, or a “least recently used”, cache. It’s nothing more than a Map with extra logic. You may also decide to <em>remove</em> past results after some time passes — similar to how browsers removes the cached assets after they expire. If our parameter were an object (rather than a string, like it is above), we could use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>WeakMap</code></a> instead of <code>Map</code> in modern browsers. The benefit of <code>WeakMap</code> is that it would automatically “clean up” the entries when our object key is no longer accessible. Memoization is a flexible technique, and you can choose between many tradeoffs.</p>
<h3><a href="#memoization-and-purity" id="memoization-and-purity">Memoization and Purity</a></h3><p>We should note memoization isn’t always safe to do.</p>
<p>For example, imagine that the <code>getChanceOfRain</code> function from our magical npm package does not receive <code>city</code> as a parameter, but shows an input box to the user:</p>
<pre><code><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> city </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>prompt</span><span>(</span><span>'Where do you live?'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"The chance of rain tomorrow is:"</span><span>,</span><span> result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>If we call <code>showWeatherReport()</code> two times, we will see two input boxes. We could input different cities, and see different results in the console. But if we memoized the <code>getChanceOfRain</code> function, we would only see one input box! Each next call would keep returning the same result and wouldn’t let us enter a different city.</p>
<p>So memoization is only safe to do when the function is “pure” — that is, <strong>if it only reads its parameters and doesn’t interact with the “outside world”.</strong> With a pure function, it doesn’t matter whether you call it once or if you reuse its previous result.</p>
<p>This is why in a complex algorithm, it can be beneficial to separate the parts that <em>do</em> something from the parts that merely <em>calculate</em> something. The parts that calculate something can be pure, so they can be safely memoized and skipped on repeated calls. But the code that <em>does</em> something can’t be skipped without behavior changes:</p>
<pre><code><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> city </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>prompt</span><span>(</span><span>'Where do you live?'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"The chance of rain tomorrow is:"</span><span>,</span><span> result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>Now it would be safe to memoize <code>getChanceOfRain</code> —&nbsp;because it takes <code>city</code> as a parameter rather than showing the input box to the user. In other words, it is pure. Concretely, it would mean that you would still see an input box on every call to <code>showWeatherReport</code>, but the calculation would be skipped if we had the result.</p>
<h3><a href="#reusable-memoization" id="reusable-memoization">Reusable Memoization</a></h3><p>If you want to memoize several functions, it can be annoying to repeat the same steps every time: add a variable, check if we have the result, store the result.</p>
<p>Luckily, we have a tool at our disposal — <em>functions!</em> — that lets us automate this. <strong>We will use a function to “write” this repetitive memoization logic for us.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s take our first example that memoizes the last result:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>let</span><span> isCalculated </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> lastResult</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>memoizedGetChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>isCalculated</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> lastResult</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  lastResult </span><span>=</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  isCalculated </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>Then let’s wrap it all (without any changes) in a function called <code>memoize</code>:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>function</span><span> </span><span>memoize</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> isCalculated </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> lastResult</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>memoizedGetChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>isCalculated</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>return</span><span> lastResult</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    lastResult </span><span>=</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    isCalculated </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>ret…</span></p></code></pre></article></div>

		<p>Making music is expensive. The hardware is expensive enough, but buying all the software you need can round up to thousands of dollars. A single license for a leading DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) like Ableton Live can run up to $750.</p>
<p>But music production software doesn’t have to be so expensive.</p>
<p>In fact, if you take the Open Source Software (OSS) route, you can get cutting-edge music making tools for $0.</p>
<p>Finding all the right tools, however, is a challenge. A lot of existing OSS lists are outdated – some of these tools haven’t been updated since 2004. Most existing articles aren’t comprehensive enough.</p>
<p>Which is why I spent the last two days putting together the single most comprehensive list of current and available open source music production tools.<span id="more-4160"></span></p>
<p>Every single tool in this list had to meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be free – no strings attached</li>
<li>It should be open source, that is, you should be able to access the source code</li>
</ul>
<p>While not all open source software runs on Mac and Windows, most of the tools on this list do. And of course, every single one of them works on Linux.</p>
<p>These strict requirements meant that a lot of popular Linux music tools, like Reaper and Bitwig, did not make the cut. However, there are perfectly competent – and <em>free</em> – alternatives, as I’ve shared below.</p>
<p>Another thing – not everyone processes information the same way. So I’ve shared the same information as both a long table, as well as a categorized list of tools. You can jump to whichever tool you prefer using the links below:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#tab-view">Table View</a></li>
<li><a href="#cat-view">Category View</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want detailed information about the license, availability, and source code/download links, refer to the table view. For a quick overview, use the category view.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that working with free software is a little more complicated than working with proprietary tools. Some of the tools I’ve shared below might also lack the features or user-friendliness (not that music software is particularly user-friendly to begin with!) of their paid counterparts. On the flip side, you get completely free software, and you support the FOSS community.</p>
<p>At the end of this post, I’ve also shared some thoughts on building a completely free studio, including my software recommendations.</p>

<h2 id="cat-view"><span>Open Source Music Production Tools (Category View)</span></h2>
<p>From audio editors to full-fledged digital audio workstations, there’s free music production software to fulfill most of your music making needs.</p>
<p>Here are some of the top choices across each category:</p>

<h2 id="tab-view"><span>Building a Free Music Production Studio</span></h2>
<p>After going through the list above, you’re probably thinking:&nbsp;<em>that’s a lot of software!</em></p>
<p>This was a (pleasant) surprise for me as well. I grew up with Cubase before moving onto Logic and eventually, Ableton. In this world of proprietary software, you’ve always had a lot of choice.</p>
<p>But I didn’t expect the open source world to have as many&nbsp;<em>competent&nbsp;</em>offerings as well. Some of the DAWs I shared above can go toe-to-toe with the best in the closed source world.</p>
<p>If you’re new to music production, however, going through all these tools can be a little confusing (and overwhelming).</p>
<p>To make matters simpler, I’ll show you how to create a music production studio for $0 – all by using the tools listed above.</p>
<h3><strong>Understand what you need to produce music</strong></h3>
<p>There are three parts to music production:</p>
<ul>
<li>Composition and arrangement</li>
<li>Sound synthesis and design</li>
<li>Mixing and mastering</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these should be self-explanatory, but I’ll break them down further for the beginners reading this.</p>
<p><strong>Composition and arrangement&nbsp;</strong>is the process of creating a piece of music and organizing different musical elements (i.e. “arranging”) to achieve a particular effect. If you write an original song on your guitar, that song would be called your “composition”.</p>
<p>Depending on your preferences, you can play this song in different styles (rock, pop, punk, etc.) – this is called “arrangement”.</p>
<p>In music production software, composition and arrangement usually happens on a timeline view. You can add/remove different musical elements at different to create a song. The timeline is typically divided into seconds and bars.</p>
<p>For example, here’s the timeline view in Ableton Live of one of my tracks:</p>
<figure id="attachment_4225" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4225"><img src="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement.jpg" alt="" width="669" height="559" srcset="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement.jpg 669w, https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement-300x251.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px" data-srcset="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement.jpg 669w, https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement-300x251.jpg 300w" data-src="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4225">The Ableton timeline view makes it possible to create complex compositions and arrangements</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Sound synthesis and design&nbsp;</strong>is the process of manipulating a sound or a signal to produce a desired effect. Add a distortion pedal to your electric guitar, and you’re essentially “designing” your own sound.</p>
<p>There are several approach to sound design and synthesis. You can take an audio clip (called a “sample”) and turn it into a sound via a “sampler”. Or you can use a synthesizer to manipulate a simple audio signal (such as a sine wave) into your desired sound. You can further modulate this sound using various effects like reverb, delay, etc. Add a reverb, for instance, and the sound will feel wider and roomier.</p>
<p>For example, here’s a screenshot from one of the sounds I created in Serum, one of the most popular software synthesizers around.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4227" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4227"><img src="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/serum.jpg" alt="" width="721" height="600" srcset="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/serum.jpg 721w, https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/serum-300x250.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px" data-srcset="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/serum.jpg 721w, https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/serum-300x250.jpg 300w" data-src="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/serum.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4227">Serum is a popular virtual synth that can help you create complex sounds</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Mixing and mastering&nbsp;</strong>is the process of adjusting volume, effects, equalization, compression, etc. to create a track that sounds good on different speakers/headphones. A “good” mix is a balanced mix. Mixing and mastering is usually done by audio engineers who carefully adjust EQ, …</p></div></div></article></div>

To that end, the following is a compilation of some of the most well-adapted, <strong>commonly-used symbols</strong> in mathematics.</p><p>Moreover, these symbols are further categorized by their <strong>function</strong>&nbsp;into tables.

<p>Last night, I started a college class for the first time since I graduated in 2017. The weekend prior, I was accepted to Stanford. Well, not exactly. I was accepted to an experimental online class from Stanford called Code in Place which is based on the school’s well-regarded CS106A Programming Methodology course. </p>



<p>After being rejected by Stanford twice, once for undergraduate coming out of my gap year in 2013 and a second time for their Deferred Enrollment MBA program in 2017, it was nice to finally get some good news back from the Silicon Valley school where Google was born and <a href="https://blogofjake.com/2020/02/13/steve-jobs-stanford-commencement-speech-2005/">Steve Jobs spoke</a>.</p>



<p>For the record, I consider myself very fortunate to have received both of those rejections because, without them, everything afterwards would have changed. I choose to appreciate everything about my past because I do not see much benefit in wondering how things could have gone differently or wishing for ways in which they could have.</p>



<p>Anyway, a combination of discovering this course from Stanford one day, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being">a class from Yale </a>the next day, and <a href="https://online-learning.harvard.edu/catalog/free">a number of classes from Harvard</a> the day after that made me realize that the coming shift in higher education has already begun.</p>



<p>Before speculating upon what that shift may look like, it is important to acknowledge that one of two things is likely to happen, and they represent very different scenarios. The first scenario is easier to imagine but harder for me to believe which is that universities will open up again next fall as if it is business, or rather, education as usual. This seems unlikely to me, but with an accelerated path to an effective vaccine or the introduction of some other unforeseen factor, I am hesitant to count it out completely while it still remains within the realm of possibility from my perspective. The second scenario which I believe is much more likely is that we will not go back to education as usual in the fall. Instead, education will continue to be online as it has been for the last few weeks under the guise of a temporary solution to be relied on only during this thought to be relatively short-lived shelter-in-place period. This shift to online education is somewhat obvious and predictable if in fact circumstances remain several months from now so that live in-person classes in the physical world will no longer be feasible, practical, or responsible, and it is important to remember that if any institution is going to risk lives and people’s health, liberal arts colleges are probably the least likely of them all to do so. What is not as obvious or easily predictable from my perspective is how the new digital format for classes will change countless other aspects of higher education and society at large.</p>



<p>Scott Galloway had an excellent monologue on this subject in the most recent episode of his eponymous podcast, The Prof G Show. (For those who read <a href="https://blogofjake.com/2020/03/30/the-weekend-miscellaneous-7-six-easy-pieces-burn-after-reading-bedminster-pizza-ttyl-bombshell/">a previous post in which I tried to use the word eponymous but somewhat forced it</a>, hopefully we can agree this usage was much cleaner and closer to correct.) In his monologue, Scott talks about how elite universities have become the ultimate luxury brands by rejecting over 90% of their prospective customers otherwise known as students unlike even the most luxurious brands in the world like Rolex or Louis Vuitton or Rolls Royce would ever consider doing. He talks about how the value-add of universities lies as much or more in the certification than in the education and how higher education is ripe for disruption based on what he calls a disruptability index which he defines as “a function of your ability to increase prices faster than inflation without having any underlying increase in productivity of the product.” I liked that straight forward definition. Lastly, Scott talks about how schools will still want to make money and says that they will need to accept many more students in order to maintain revenues because their excessive prices, which have already garnered plenty of attention but which to date have been unrelenting due to continued demand, will now become much more egregiously apparent to even the wealthiest of parents who will have no choice but to ask why they are paying $50,000 a year for their child to join 3 or 4, 20- or 200- person Zoom classes per day, five or even only four or three days per week, taught by someone who seems less effective at online education than the people who teach the free Khan Academy videos. The college price tag that used to be justified by not only the certification but the overall experience and the access to resources and the dining hall and the dorms and the people to meet and the lifelong relationships to form, in addition to the hopefully premium version of an actual education which I am by no means discounting but simply pales in comparison to the monetary value that the word Wharton on a resume affords an individual to more easily earn over their lifetime compared to another individual with the word of a university that you or I and therefore most employers have never heard of or do not regard as good, let alone great or elite.</p>



<p>So, how will it happen that schools will begin to accept more students from whom they can generate lower revenues per student to equal the same or similar revenues as they are accustomed to? I believe we are seeing the beginning of it now, and if that is any indication of the speed and magnitude of the change, it looks poised to be large and fast.</p>



<p>I never previously had the opportunity to be a student at an Ivy League school. Already I now have the opportunity to become a student at all of them, for free. I think what we are seeing now is a land grab, or in more literal terms, a student grab. I believe the top schools are foreseeing the coming disruption of themselves and others and have come to the same conclusion that they need to expand their student base. Based on what I have seen thus far, it seems to me that they are beginning to test and implement a tried and true strategy that has been successful for so many tech and media companies before them, and that is, the freemium strategy. </p>



<p>Elite universities are now giving away their most basic offerings for free to get as many students on board as they possibly can so that the base is as large as possible for them to upsell once they figure out how exactly they want to do that based on what they believe will be the best way to monetize their student base which will soon be degrees of magnitude larger than ever before for schools like Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and hopefully my alma mater too. I say hopefully because by default the schools that do not grow will shrink, not only in students but in relevance and prominence and therefore in the benefits that graduates will experience by having their schools’ names on their resumes. </p>



<p>Premium products will be varying and virtually limitless and the prices for the very best of them I imagine will be very steep. For example, one may be able to take an intro to macroeconomics class from Harvard for free but the advanced classes as one works his or her way up the chain of prerequisites to the land of advanced electives will cost money, likely more and more of it as the student advances further. Alternatively, I suppose all of those classes could remain free and the approach to charging for premium offerings could be focused more on gaining access to smaller classes or ones with more small group Zoom meetings or ones with better professors with better reviews. Perhaps professors will be paid more like restaurant workers in that they are given a nominal wage in exchange for their work and the opportunity to earn large tips from generous diners for their excellent service, or in this case, ad-hoc income from wealthier students for their one-on-one tutoring sessions or access to office hours. Unlike most restaurant workers, some professors could make an absolute killing this way. </p>



<p>I am not sure exactly how all of this will take shape but I am reasonably confident that if higher education is heading in a digital direction, as it appears to be, then the freemium model will be widely employed. As a result, many more people worldwide will have access to the best schools in the world, which is a good thing, but people will still have to pay potentially steep prices for things like certification which unfortunately are unreasonably valued by top employers making their seemingly unreasonable prices unfortunately reasonable. I’m taking the Code in Place class from Stanford for the next five weeks and I expect to gain the valuable new skill of basic programming for free which is awesome and amazing, but was not surprised when I read in no uncertain terms before applying that I would not be getting any sort of university credit or certification for completing the class. Of course, that would be far too valuable to give away for free. Schools will give away the product but not the certification, because that is the biggest part of what people have been paying for all long. One question I am curious to see answered is what happens when I and the 10,000 other students taking this Code in Place Stanford class with me put it on their resumes anyway? What happens if employers start caring less about where you learned and more about what you know? I suppose as with most things these days, we will just have to do our best to guess, or otherwise wait to find out.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Visly is a large, complex React app - as you can probably imagine, state management is something we think a lot about. Recently, we decided to move away from using popular community state management frameworks and implement our own solution, named simply <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code>. To many this may sound like a bad idea, and to be honest we thought so too at first. But after attempting to solve our problems with existing solutions, nothing was working like we wanted it to, so we decided to give our own a try. We're incredibly happy with the end result. Let me tell you why we built our own solution and how it works!</p><a id="background" href="#background"><h2>Background</h2></a><p>First, I think it’s important to give a quick introduction to the technical architecture of Visly for context.</p><p>Visly is an electron app written in React &amp; Typescript with a background Node process that manages shared state and our code generation pipeline. The frontend itself is split up into many smaller React apps, each running within its own electron renderer instance. This allows tabs in Visly to render independently as they are separate render processes. Each render process (tab) talks to the background process to fetch project data, which in turn is read from the file system. The render processes then cache this data locally to speed up interactions. Mutations, or changes to the data, are synchronized back to the background process and then shared with all other render processes to make sure they also have the latest changes. </p><p>An important thing to note is that the background and render processes operate on the same data models, but keep local copies to stay performant. Also, even though our background process acts as a backend, it runs locally, meaning we don't have the same performance and availability concerns a typical web app may have.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/h56a2v5anqe2/2HJYDGMJylae01yLg8cwKq/d0b65ae0ce848480c92f7bdaba249fa9/excalidraw-202012613850-2.png"></p><a id="the-problem" href="#the-problem"><h2>The problem</h2></a><p>Before migrating to <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code>, we were using a mix of <a href="http://apollographql.com/">Apollo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/react-spring/zustand">Zustand</a>, <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html">React context</a>, and unmanaged global object stores to store state in Visly. This led to a ton of problems keeping state between the various stores in sync. While this was mostly a problem of our own creation - we kept adding solutions without going back and cleaning up old solutions - and could have been solved by implementing and sticking with a single solution, the reason we kept adding additional solutions was that nothing we tried solved all our problems. </p><p>The issue with Apollo was not so much Apollo, but rather GraphQL; Visly is just not a great use case for it. In Visly, we need access to all data on every page of the application, while GraphQL is built for apps where every page only uses a subset of the available data. In addition to this, while Apollo does offer subscriptions for live updating data, they aren't designed to be the main delivery mechanism for data, or design for apps where all data is live. We actually ended up writing our own subscription mechanisms as well as disabling the built-in Apollo cache.</p><p>The issue with react context is that it's very hard to enable minimal updates to the component tree when data changes. When data changes in a context, then all subscribers to that context change, whether or not they depend on the specific data that changed.</p><p>The issue with Zustand, Redux, Recoil, and many other existing global state management solutions, which do offer fine-grained control of component re-rendering, was that they were very tightly coupled to the React ecosystem, whereas we wanted to make use of the same functionality across our frontend, backend, and command line tools.</p><p>We wanted a single solution that would solve all these problems and give us the ability to implement cross-process state synchronization, history management, performance debugging, and transaction support on a higher level, outside of product code. So we decided to build <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code>.</p><a id="requirements" href="#requirements"><h2>Requirements</h2></a><p>As we were looking to overhaul state management within Visly, we started by taking a step back to identify all our requirements. We then tried to work these into various open source tools such as <a href="https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started">redux</a>, <a href="https://mobx.js.org/README.html">mobx</a>, and even new libraries such as <a href="http://recoiljs.org/">Recoil</a>. While we could have gotten them all to work, none of them felt like a natural fit with how we wanted to manage our state, and would have required significant work to build plugins and wrappers around their APIs anyways. So what were we looking for? We wanted a tool that had:</p><div><ul><li index="0">Support for history management (i.e. - undo/redo);</li><li index="1">Minimal re-rendering of React components;</li><li index="2">Support for both React and Node environments;</li><li index="3">Built-in concepts for synchronizing state between different processes;</li><li index="4">Ability to split state between multiple stores and perform mutations across them;</li><li index="5">Plain function mutations &amp; selectors that can easily be tested and reused outside of React;</li><li index="6">Immutable data; and</li><li index="7">Was built for Typescript.</li></ul></div><p>We also plan to implement support for concurrent mode in future - it's something we're super excited to make use of in Visly, and I'm confident that we can implement support for in <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code> when it reaches stability.</p><a id="visly-state" href="#visly-state"><h2>visly-state</h2></a><p>Time to take a look at how <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code> works and how it solves these problems for us. In its most simple usage, <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code> can be used almost exactly as React’s built-in <code value="useState">useState</code>, except that the state is stored in a global store instead of attached directly to a single component instance, meaning the state is shared between all components that read from it.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> state <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state'</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> useVislyState <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state/hooks'</span>

<span>const</span> counter <span>=</span> <span>state</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> count<span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span>

<span>function</span> <span><span>Component</span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>[</span>state<span>,</span> setState<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useVislyState</span><span>(</span>counter<span>)</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>increment</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setState</span><span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span> s<span>.</span><span>count</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>increment<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Count: </span><span>{</span>state<span>.</span><span>count</span><span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>In practice, this simple usage isn’t very common. We use it mostly for very simple global state, such as our <code value="zoomState">zoomState</code>, which keeps track of how much you have zoomed into the Visly canvas. </p><p>Instead, we make use of <code value="useValue">useValue</code> and <code value="useMutation">useMutation</code> hooks, which take selector and mutation functions respectively. Selectors are functions which, given a piece of state, return some derived state, either a subset of the state or some new state computed from the underlying state object. Mutations functions are what they sound like, function that apply mutations to a state object.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> state <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state'</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> useValue<span>,</span> useMutation <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state/hooks'</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre><p>As you can see from this example, selector and mutation functions are just plain old Javascript functions and therefore can be shared with code running outside of a React app and can be unit tested very easily.</p><pre><code><span>test</span><span>(</span><span>'count is correctly incremented'</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> state <span>=</span> <span>{</span> count<span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>

    <span>expect</span><span>(</span>state<span>.</span><span>count</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>toBe</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Another benefit of using <code value="useValue">useValue</code> with a selector function is that components can subscribe to only a subset of the data in a state object, meaning if you have a large state object and only change a single property, then only components that read that property will update.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> state <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state'</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> useValue<span>,</span> useMutation <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state/hooks'</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre><p>One thing you’ll notice is how mutations make changes to the state directly instead of returning a new object with the updates included. You may even think that this is a very bad pattern, we shouldn’t be mutating state, state should be immutable! Well it is :) Under the hood <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code> uses <a href="https://immerjs.github.io/immer">immer</a>, a fantastic javascript library for working with immutable data. Before <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code> calls your mutations it will actually create a mutable copy of the state object for you to apply your changes to, it will then use immer to track the changes you have made and use those changes to create a new immutable state object. The benefit of this is that mutations become very simple to write compared to typical reducers which require destructuring many layers of nested properties.</p><h3>Synced state</h3><p>Another benefit we gain from using immer to track changes during mutations is that we can use that change set to efficiently synchronize state with a remote store (for example our background process!). We’ve built this functionality into what we called <code value="syncedState">syncedState</code>. A synced state works just like a number state object except all changes are synchronized via a global <code value="syncAdapter">syncAdapter</code>, this sync adapter can be implemented on both the frontend and backend to enable live sync of state updates.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> syncedState<span>,</span> setSyncAdapter <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state'</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>WSSyncAdapter</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state/sync/socket'</span>

<span>setSyncAdapter</span><span>(</span><span><span>WSSyncAdapter</span></span><span>(</span><span>'wss://localhost:3000'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>

<span>const</span> counter <span>=</span> <span>syncedState</span><span>(</span><span>'CountState'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> count<span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>That’s all you need to make sure all changed to <code value="counter">counter</code> are synced back to your backend. Your backend will then implement its own sync adapter, which can contain additional logic for reconciling multiple change sets and managing any potential conflicts. As you can see, the only difference from a regular local <code value="state">state</code> here is that we supply what we call a <code value="syncKey">syncKey</code>, which is an …</p></div></div>

  <h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>

<p>In the past few posts we’ve gone over how to interpret matrices, basis vectors, and eigenvectors. Today, we’ll put all that together towards a really fun goal - building a toy quantum computer at home!  We’ll even solve a real problem on this “computer” that we couldn’t solve as efficiently on a standard computer.</p>

<p>All this will continue our understanding of the diverse and exciting applications of Linear Algebra.</p>

<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h3>

<p>We are going to build a toy “quantum computer” just using a display, and a few polarizing filters.</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> $20</p>

<p><strong>Materials</strong></p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/materials.jpg">
These are all the materials we will use. A cell phone, and a linear polarizer filter sheet.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your cell phone (or any display/light).</li>
  <li>
    <p>A polarization sheet such as the one in the link below.</p>

<h3 id="using-light-to-harness-quantum-properties">Using Light to Harness Quantum Properties</h3>

<p>To begin our process of building a computer we need to understand one of the foundational concepts in physics - light! Physicists in the 20th century developed quantum mechanics by studying some of the incredible properties of light. A few of these examples are shown below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect">Photoelectric Effect (the discovery that Einstein won his Nobel Prize for)</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Showed light is composed of discrete units called photons.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iuv6hY6zsd0">Double-Slit Experiment</a>
    <ul>
      <li>One of the seminal experiments in proving light can behave as both a wave and a particle.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXfrncRey-4">Black Body Radiation problem</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Studied by Max Planck and led to the discovery of Planck’s constant - a fundamental number in Quantum Mechanics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In this project, we will use the quantum properties of light to create something like a computer. Specifically, we will use a property of light known as polarization to carry out computations in our computer.</p>

<p>Let’s now dive into what exactly light polarization is and how we can leverage it.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="polarization-overview">Polarization Overview</h2>

<p>In the 1800s, Maxwell <a href="https://www.space.com/speed-of-light-properties-explained.html">famously discovered</a> that light is a direct consequence of electricity and magnetism (in fact, the movement of electrons in space generates light!). He found that light is an <strong>electromagnetic</strong> wave (an electric and magnetic field that travels through space).</p>

<p>In this electromagnetic wave, there are two parts: the electric field wave and the magnetic field wave. We call direction of orientation of the electric field the <strong>polarization</strong> of light.</p>

<p>

    Image source: https://socratic.org/questions/58f0fd7e7c0149308e221579
</p>

<hr>

<p>You may be surprised at just how often we use polarization everyday. For instance, any time you put on a pair of polarized sunglasses on a sunny day, you are harnessing light polarization! The black lenses on polarized sunglasses block certain types of light to reduce the glare that we see. The lenses do so by only letting in light of a certain polarization angle and blocking all other light.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/sunglasses.png">
    The lenses on polarized sunglasses are polarization filters that only allow light of a specific polarization through. Image Source (https://vision-works.co.za/polarized-lenses-explained/)

    A sunglass lens is a specific example of a polarization filter - a barrier that only lets in light of a specific polarization angle.
</p>
<p>This may seem fairly straight forward but as we study polarization more, we notice some really counterintuitive properties that are in fact deeply rooted in quantum mechanics. Namely, light can seemingly be polarized in multiple states at once!</p>

<h2 id="photons-can-be-polarized-in-multiple-directions-at-once">Photons Can Be Polarized in Multiple Directions at Once</h2>

<p>Let us now dig into what makes light polarization so useful in building a quantum computer.</p>

<p>Through experiments, we  will see that a single photon of light can be polarized <strong>in multiple directions at once</strong>. This is an idea rooted in quantum physics known as <strong>superposition.</strong>.</p>

<p>

    <br>
    In the thought experiment, Schrodinger's Cat is somehow both **dead and alive** at the same time. In the same way, a photon of light can be polarized **in multiple directions** at the same time.
</p>

<p>You may have seen superposition in the famous Schrodinger’s Cat paradox where the cat is somehow both   “dead” and “alive” at the same time. This is exactly what we’ll see is going on with the state of a photon’s polarization!</p>

<h3 id="experiments">Experiments</h3>

<p>Let us now see this ourselves! We will run a set of experiments to in fact ourselves verify that <strong>light can be polarized in multiple angles at once.</strong>. Note with a large set of photons we can explain these effects using classical physics but when we get down to single photons, we need to use the quantum interpretation we will soon discuss.</p>

<p>Here are the experiments we will run:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Experiment 1 -</strong> Shows how polarizers work to help us develop an intuition.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment 2 -</strong> Shows that if light is vertically polarized it cannot be horizontally polarized.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment 3 -</strong> Shows that introducing a 45º&nbsp;polarizer allows light to be superposed in multiple polarizations at once.</li>
</ul>

<p>These experiments are heavily based on the following video from Minute Physics and 3Blue1Brown.</p>

<h3 id="experiment-1---effect-of-vertical-polarizer">Experiment 1 - Effect of Vertical polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Our first experiment is going to simply show what a vertical polarizer does. We’ll be able to see that it blocks out some amount of light and only lets vertically polarized light through.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Only vertically polarized light comes out of that section.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it in Action</strong></p>

<p>Below is my phone with a small vertical polarizer on the top left corner.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/phone_vertical.jpg">
    A vertical polarizer is present on the top-left corner of the screen.
</p>

<hr>

<p>Conceptually, the polarizer in the top-left corner is blocking everything but vertically polarized light as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_1.png" alt="Phone Blocked"></p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>

<p>A vertically polarized filter only lets vertically polarized light out.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="experiment-2---effect-of-vertical--horizontal-polarizer">Experiment 2 - Effect of Vertical + Horizontal Polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Our next experiment will show that vertically polarized light is entirely blocked by a horizontal polarizer. We will place a horizontal polarizer on top of a vertical polarizer and see that little to no light comes through.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Place a horizontal filter on the same section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Notice how little to no light now appears.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it In Action</strong></p>

<p>Below is my phone with a both a vertical and horizontal polarizer in sequence (the yellow tab shows the orientation of the polarizer). Notice how we can no longer read the screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/phone_blocked.png" alt="Phone Blocked"></p>

<hr>

<p>With the addition of the horizontal polarizer, all light is effectively blocked in the top-left corner of the screen as seen below:</p>

    A vertical polarizer followed by a horizontal polarizer will block all light.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Vertically polarized light cannot go through a horizontal filter.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="experiment-3---effect-of-vertical--45º--horizontal-polarizer">Experiment 3 - Effect of Vertical + 45º + Horizontal polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>This is the fun part! We now get to see what happens when you place a 45º&nbsp;filter in between a vertical and horizontal polarizing filter. What we’d expect is the same as in experiment 2 - no light gets through. If polarizers just block light, surely adding a third polarizer will only block more light.</p>

<p>However,  what we end up seeing is quite unexpected!</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Place a horizontal filter on top of it.</li>
  <li>Place a 45º&nbsp;filter in between the vertical and horizontal filter.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it in Action</strong></p>

<p>Adding the diagonal polarizer really does let some light through (about 50% of it)! You can see this below as I move a diagonally oriented polarizer between the vertical and horizontal polarizer.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/diagonal_polarizer.gif" alt="Diagonal Polarizer"></p>

<hr>

<p>Adding the diagonal polarizer somehow leads to <strong>more light</strong> against all expectations! We can see what’s happening in the diagram below. We will explain this more in the following section so don’t worry too much if you don’t understand it.</p>

<p>

    A vertical filter followed by a 45º filter and then a horizontal filter will let some light through.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Light that is seemingly vertically polarized can somehow become horizontally polarized.</li>
  <li>The 45º filter is needed for this change to happen. Without it we see no light can come out.
    <ul>
      <li>Without 45º filter</li>

<h2 id="understanding-experiment-3">Understanding Experiment 3</h2>

<p>So what is going on in Experiment 3? How does vertically polarized light go through the 45º&nbsp;filter?</p>

<h3 id="thinking-of-photons-as-combinations">Thinking of Photons as Combinations</h3>

<p>We can think of a vertical line/vector (black) as the sum of a 135º (blue) vector&nbsp;and 45º (purple) vector. This is shown below:</p>

<div>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/vectors.png">
        A vertical line can be seen as a sum of diagonal line 1 and diagonal line 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/vectors_expanded.png">
            The horizontal components of 1 and 2 cancel out when added, leading to a vertical line.
    </p>        
</div>

<p>So in that sense, we can think of a vertically filtered photon as the <strong>combination</strong> of a 135º filtered photon and a 45º filtered photon. Or in other words, the vertically filtered photon can be seen as filtered in <strong>both these angles at once</strong> (Note that it’s a very <strong>specific amount</strong> (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><msqrt><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msqrt></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">  \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} </annotation></semantics></math></span></span>) of each of these options. But we are going to postpone that discussion for now).</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/photon_sum.png">
    A vertically filtered photon can be seen as a combination of a 45º polarized photon and a 135º polarized photon.
</p>

<p>Equipped with this idea, let’s now revisit experiment 4’s setup. We are going to break it up into <strong>Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_broken_up.png" alt="Experiment 3 Broken Up"></p>

<p>We will break up Experiment 3 into three steps.</p>

<h3 id="step-1---vertical-filter">Step 1 - Vertical Filter</h3>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_step_1.png">
</p>

<p>Step 1 is fairly straightforward - The vertical polarizer only lets vertically polarized  photons through. The horizontally polarized photons get blocked.</p>

<h3 id="step-2---45ºfilter">Step 2 - 45º&nbsp;Filter</h3>

<p><span>I</span>n April 2020, in the midst of an ongoing national lockdown, Ahmed Imran Kabir decided to buy a parrot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After most of the management classes Kabir taught at a university in Dhaka were canceled or moved online, he suddenly had plenty of time to focus on his passion project: becoming a part-time bird breeder. Sitting in his three-bedroom apartment one day, Kabir keyed in the phrase “Buy-sell birds Dhaka” on Facebook and joined about half a dozen groups dedicated to avian retail.</p>



<p>“Breeding pair. Age: 20 days. Contact by phone or inbox” read one post, alongside images of a pair of grayish-brown cockatiels. Another seller, located in the Kallyanpur neighborhood in Dhaka, posted pictures of yellow-feathered lutino cockatiels, with the Bengali phrase <em>hat bodol hobe — </em>which loosely translates as “to change hands.” The wording was intended to circumvent a Facebook algorithm that, to prevent wildlife trafficking, automatically takes down posts with “buy” or “sell” in the description. If an interested buyer did contact an owner, the next step was to haggle over the price of the bird on Facebook Messenger.</p>



<p>Kabir bought his first pair of birds from the 3,000-person Facebook group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/485404175472217/">A.S.ককাটেল পাখি হাত বদল</a> — “A.S. Cockatiel changes hands.” For that purchase, the seller delivered the birds in person to collect them, and Kabir paid in cash. He was so pleased with his decision that he bought 24 more pairs over the next two weeks, including breeds such as Gouldian finches, Bengalese finches, and crested Bengalese finches. Each pair cost anywhere between $15 and $60, depending upon the breed and its age. “At one point, I started running out of space to accommodate all the birds, and sent about half a dozen Bengalese finches, along with some Gouldians, to my fiancee’s place,” he recalled. Finally, he gave in and bought a large birdcage.</p>



<p>From discovery to delivery, this whole process happened on Facebook.</p>



<p>Kabir’s story is reflective of how the majority of e-commerce now happens in Bangladesh. In the absence of giant online marketplaces like Amazon, thousands of bespoke Facebook pages and groups have been created to meet customer demand for ornaments, apparel, cosmetics, mobile accessories, and, of course, birds.</p>



<p><strong>Read: <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/randi-rahbar-shopyobrand-iraq/"><em>“What do I do with a credit card in a country like Iraq?”</em></a></strong></p>



<p>The phenomenon has grown so much over the years that the number of stores on Facebook now eclipse the number of sellers on local e-commerce websites like Evaly, Ajkerdeal, or the Alibaba-acquired <a href="https://www.daraz.com.bd/">Daraz</a>. No one knows exactly how many of these businesses exist, but the most recent estimates suggest that Bangladesh <a href="https://idlc.com/mbr/article.php?id=192">has over 300,000</a>. The low barriers to entry —&nbsp;all an aspiring entrepreneur needs is an internet connection and around $350<strong> </strong>to cover startup costs —&nbsp;present a tremendous opportunity for a generation of young Bangladeshis reeling from mass layoffs and fear of <a href="https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/2019/06/28/rise-of-the-educated-unemployed">rising unemployment</a> rates, which are projected to impact at least 15% of the working population. It also has opened other doors: in a country where just over 15 percent of women have mobile internet access, <a href="https://idlc.com/mbr/article.php?id=192">half</a> of Facebook sellers are female.</p>



<p>By and large, these Facebook stores are usually window fronts for click-and-order shopping. Unlike in formal marketplaces, most sellers are not licensed, store their inventory at home, and partner with third-party logistics companies for last-mile delivery. It’s all very simple: after a buyer makes a selection, payments are arranged via off- or online methods, and items are delivered by mail. No equivalent exists in the West, where Facebook’s forays into commerce have been met with a muted response. For a 162-million-strong country struggling with poverty and limited job growth, this new model of business is illustrative of the South Asian concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugaad"><em>jugaad</em></a> — making do with what’s available. And it already has a name: F-commerce.&nbsp;</p>

<hr>



<p><strong>Nuzhat Akhter has</strong> been selling on Facebook for only six years, but she’s already considered a veteran in the F-commerce sphere. Her site, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/277430245935147/"><em>Posh World</em></a>, has over 8,000 followers on Facebook, thanks to her carefully cultivated selection of consumer<strong> </strong>goods. From her home in Bangladesh, Akhter sources all kinds of products — helmets, handbags, Ralph Lauren shirts, even branded car parts — and accepts preorders daily. If an item isn’t featured on her site, customers can send links or screenshots of things they want from any co.uk website. Customer service is handled via Messenger and her Facebook page, and Akhter guarantees delivery within two weeks.</p>



<p>The 34-year-old mother set up her Facebook store three months after the birth of her son in 2014 and has built a loyal following over the years. Akhter spends her mornings scouring the<em> </em>British websites of popular brands like The Body Shop, Superdrug, Clarks, and so on, hunting for flash sales or discounts. Once she finds a good deal, she shares the link on her Facebook group with screenshots: “3 hr left flash sale bodyshop 50%.” In June, orders totaled over $800. Akhter’s success is especially notable, as it’s uncommon to see a Bangladeshi woman running her own business. In many traditional South Asian households, women are discouraged from working after marriage.</p>



<p>The reason thousands of Bangladeshis depend on Akhter to do their shopping is that she has access to something very few of them do: a credit card, and an international one at that. “It’s my secret weapon,” Akhter said. To prevent money laundering, Bangladesh has issued roughly <a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/business/banking/credit-card-market-still-untapped-1452808">1.5 million</a> credit cards, and even those cards have a $300 transaction limit for international online purchases. This has created a boom in cross-border F-commerce and turned retail arbitrage into a thriving sector.</p>



<p>The rise of F-commerce has also inadvertently ushered in more-direct models of customer engagement, moving away from impersonal help pages and suggestion boxes.<strong> </strong>Qazi<strong> </strong>Fahimda Hasan, the 26-year-old founder of an F-commerce business that focuses on beauty and lifestyle products, has made this part of her brand’s identity. Through Facebook Messenger, she shares tips for identifying counterfeit products, such as checking for irregularities in packaging, spotting spelling errors, verifying barcodes, and so on. She also invested in a mini-photography studio to take professional photos and videos of her inventory. The pictures on her Facebook wall act as a real-time bulletin board for her click-and-order store. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Globally, the hottest new trend for online sellers is livestreaming. In China, consumers on Pinduoduo are using it to break into the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/e-commerce/article/3022929/chinas-social-e-commerce-sector-more-double-us185-billion-sales">$200 billion</a> market for impulse and everyday purchases. In the United States, Amazon has been experimenting with <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-live-launches-with-live-streamed-shopping-videos/">Amazon Live</a> Creator, which lets merchants set up streams to showcase their products. (So far, it seems to have had little success.) In Bangladesh, sellers go on Facebook Live to promote items, respond to questions, and take instant orders. Some products attract larger crowds than others. </p>



<p>“People simply go crazy for whitening creams,” said Akhter. “I mean, you could have 1,000 or 2,000 people watching a live demo on Facebook.” With little formal regulation, this is all based on trust. Many sellers aren’t concerned with looking glamorous or dressing up for the camera, and at first glance, their streams often come across as an ersatz version of the Home Shopping Network in the U.S.</p>

<p>Before the pandemic, a seller who goes by only Sulaiman would spend his evenings holding Facebook livestreams in front of multicolor <em>sarees</em> in his clothing shop, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/symbolfashionhouse/videos/2684482508481909/">Symbol Fashion House</a>, in Dhaka. Then, he was forced to change venues. In a twenty-minute stream from his living room, Sulaiman <a href="https://www.facebook.com/symbolfashionhouse/videos/">shows</a> off a variety of clothes on offer, explaining the decorative stones on a <em>salwar </em>and the embroidery on a fabric. “Each of our <em>chunni</em> prints cost 550 taka [6$]. Take a screenshot and inbox the picture if interested,” Sulaiman exhorts viewers. Throughout the livestream, buyers flood the chat, asking to see more colors and sizes. “We started doing Facebook Live only about six months ago,” Sulaiman told <em>Rest of World. </em>Since then, he has averaged about $4,500 a month in online orders.</p>



<p>F-commerce emerged in Bangladesh largely because there was no major e-commerce platform to absorb all the business. But although it’s biggest there, this form of selling isn’t exclusive to the country, or even the region: globally, 160 million small stores operate on Facebook, and in countries like Thailand, almost <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Thais-embrace-shopping-via-social-media">half of all online sales</a> happen through social media. Recently, platforms have started to accommodate them. Earlier this year, Facebook introduced <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/introducing-facebook-shops/">features</a> allowing sellers to customize their online shops and made it easier for them to catalogue their goods and process payments.</p>



<p>The rise of F-commerce is, of course, inextricable from Facebook. As whole sections of Bangladeshi society get online for the first time, many consider “being on the internet” as simply having registered on Facebook. According to one estimate, the social media giant had nearly <a href="https://napoleoncat.com/stats/facebook-users-in-bangladesh/2020/05">39 million</a> active users in Bangladesh in May<sub> </sub>—&nbsp;23.8% of the population. This widespread use has meant that F-commerce has expanded beyond cities like Dhaka, Chittagong, and Sylhet and pulled new kinds of consumers into online shopping.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“If Amazon were to enter, they could wipe out the market.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It’s also changed other dynamics. While Bangladeshi F-commerce shops relied on snail mail until just a few years ago, many sellers have hired logistics firms to carry out their quality checks, packaging, and delivery services, as they’ve expanded their businesses. Apart from transporting goods, logistics firms such as <a href="http://ecourierz.com/">eCourierz</a>, <a href="http://shopup.com.bd/">ShopUp</a>, …</p></div></div>

<p>I've probably read more articles on written communication in the workplace in the last two months than over the last 10 years. </p>
<p>Most of these essays gave tips on how to become better writers.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but notice that many (if not all) of them questioned the same thing: the prose.</p>
<p>Everyone advised to keep sentences short and to the point, use active voice and not passive&nbsp;voice, use fewer commas and more periods, avoid acronyms, etc.</p>
<p>Let's be clear: none of these are mistaken or wrong by any means. But this made me realize how huge the misconceptions are on what good business writing actually means.</p>
<p>In fact, what separates most people from good writing has very little to do with style, grammar, local sentences structure, word selection, or even content per se.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most people can't write well because they don't know how to control the logical sequence in which they present their ideas.</p>
<p>And that is the single most important act necessary to clear writing.</p>

<p>Writing an idea is always the result of two macro-steps. First, decide the point that we want want to make, and then put into words.</p>
<p>To understand how we can effectively share written ideas, we need to understand first how we formulate them in the first place.</p>
<p>Deciding the point you want to make is the result of a 5-step process.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Unbundling</em> a concept</li>
<li><em>Noticing</em> something</li>
<li><em>Articulating</em>/<em>Developing</em> an idea</li>
<li><em>Re-Bundling</em>&nbsp;</li>
<li><em>Reframing</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="unbundling-a-concept"><a href="#unbundling-a-concept" aria-label="unbundling a concept permalink"></a>Unbundling A Concept</h3>
<p>Every idea begins with an unbundling process. Unbundling is an act of exploration that leads to the decoupling of all the individual items of a certain subject.</p>
<p>Unbundling something doesn't imply a deep understanding of it. It's more a perception of full awareness.</p>
<p>In fact, you might not even know how every individual piece works, but you know they all exist in separate forms. No hidden parts.</p>
<h3 id="noticing-something"><a href="#noticing-something" aria-label="noticing something permalink"></a>Noticing Something</h3>
<p>Unbundling enhances our ability to observe, and this can lead us to noticing something. This can be a pattern, an insight, a novelty, or even a minor detail.</p>
<p>If <em>unbundling</em> is the flint, <em>noticing</em> is the spark that really makes the fire.</p>
<h3 id="articulatingdeveloping-an-idea"><a href="#articulatingdeveloping-an-idea" aria-label="articulatingdeveloping an idea permalink"></a>Articulating/Developing An Idea</h3>
<p>Only when we notice something can we start developing an idea. That's where the creative part begins. That's where you try to develop your initial cue into a fully formed idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, if you noticed that something was unnecessary or too complicated, you might run a simplification process. If you noticed something was missing, you go through an addition or reinforcement process.</p>
<h3 id="re-bundling-and-reframing"><a href="#re-bundling-and-reframing" aria-label="re bundling and reframing permalink"></a>Re-bundling And Reframing</h3>
<p>Once you finish including your idea, you go through re-bundling. This is a reconstruction process. This is where you try to recompose a world that now contemplates your newly inserted idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bundling is a fundamental part because it's where you can verify if the your new world still holds up. If not, that's a signal you need to put more work in the articulation phase or what you noticed didn't lead to anything meaningful at all.</p>
<p>If at the end of the re-bundling process your world does hold up, you go through a reframing process.</p>
<p>On paper, this seems to be a very logical and clear process, but in reality it's much more complicated as you constantly repeat these steps of of unbundling, editing your idea, and re-bundling until you find a viable path.</p>
<p><img src="https://pulseasync.com/assets/generate-idea-complexity.png" alt="The complex process of idea generation"></p>
<p>Now that you have an idea, you need to decide how to put it into words that you can share with others.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-how-we-write"><a href="#understanding-how-we-write" aria-label="understanding how we write permalink"></a>Understanding How We Write</h2>
<p>From a broader point, the single goal of writing is to get some information into someone's head.</p>
<p>Think about it. It's almost a simulation act.</p>
<p>You need to reproduce your reader's thinking process using your brain. And know how to build up your information in a way that feels logical and makes sense to them.</p>
<p>This process has very little to do with what you went through when you came up with the idea in the first place. In fact, forcing the reader through the exact same original path you took will have the opposite effect and create more confusion.</p>
<p>Here's how it often goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have an idea <em>x</em></li>
<li>You write down a set of words <em>m</em> that lead you to <em>x</em></li>
<li>Because of the pre-existing narrative that led you to the idea, you associate <em>m -&gt; x</em></li>
<li>When you proofread it, you mentally get it. Not because <em>m -&gt; x</em> but because of all the pre-existing associations.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is how most people write. And it's exactly why most people's writing sucks.</p>
<p>Not because they use too many passive forms or weak verbs (that doesn't help either), but because they aren't able to write from the reader's perspective. Most writings lacks the basic logical order and structure.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-good-business-writing"><a href="#what-is-good-business-writing" aria-label="what is good business writing permalink"></a>What is Good Business Writing</h2>
<p>Good business writing is a combination of two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information Context</li>
<li>Information Resolution</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-build-context-the-scqa-framework"><a href="#how-to-build-context-the-scqa-framework" aria-label="how to build context the scqa framework permalink"></a>How to build Context: The SCQA Framework</h3>
<p>Context is the "<em>you're here</em>" red arrow that you can see on almost any maps. Good information context helps the reader set the frame to understand what they're about to read next.</p>
<p>Shared context helps the participants make judgments calls using the same pair of lenses.</p>
<p>A lack of a shared understanding on the basic principles can easily result in a partial understanding or conflict on what follows.</p>
<p>What's the best way to build information context?</p>
<p>Barbara Minto, a McKinsey consultant in the 70s, solved this problem with what she called the <em>SCQA framework</em>.</p>
<p>She named this framework the <em>Situation — Complication — Question — Answer</em> framework. You can unpack more on this topic in her book “The Pyramid Principle”.</p>
<p>According to Minto, context is the result of these four sub-ingredients:</p>
<ol>
<li>Situation,</li>
<li>A Complication,</li>
<li>A Question,</li>
<li>... and an Answer.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>Situation</strong> is a non-controversial statement on a subject that you know the reader will agree because it's something he already knows. By summarizing what he already knows, the situation establishes the relevance of the questions that your document is going to answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>Complication</strong> describes an alteration of a stable situation. Keep in mind, this alteration is purely fact-based. The Situation-Complication combination should lead the reader to an immediate question.</p>
<p>The <strong>Question</strong> represents an intuitive response to the complication. The best Situation-Complication scenario makes the question sound totally superfluous to state. The best questions aren't posed, they emerge.</p>
<p>The <strong>Answer</strong> is the summary of your main idea. Beware, it's the solution, not the explanation of it. Good answers are typically represented by 3/4 bullet points. No more.</p>
<p>If you squint at it, you realise that the SCQA framework turned out initial schema upside down.</p>
<p>Ideas comes up in a bottom-up fashion, but they need to be told top-down.</p>
<p>This is not how we think. But it's how we should write.</p>
<p><img src="https://pulseasync.com/assets/scqa-reversed-thinking-frmework.png" alt="SCQA reversed thinking framework"></p>
<p>Another interesting benefit of building information context using the SCQA framework is that once you've gotten the initial part out of the way, you can focus all your energy on making and supporting the case for why it's true.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-increase-resolution-whyhow-dialogues"><a href="#how-to-increase-resolution-whyhow-dialogues" aria-label="how to increase resolution whyhow dialogues permalink"></a>How to increase Resolution: Why/How Dialogues</h3>
<p>Ensuring you and your reader are in the same place before you lead him through your thinking is a necessary but non-sufficient condition. </p>
<p>Once he's aware of the gist of your main idea (Answer), you need to argue and support it. That's when you need to focus on information resolution.</p>
<p>Think of <em>information resolution</em> as the density level of details that you're able to provide to the reader. The bolder the answer, the higher resolution levels it requires.</p>
<p>If you gloss over key important passages, people will not follow your thinking and might have a partial understanding of the message.</p>
<p>How do you increase information resolution?</p>
<p>You support your initial <em>Answer</em> using the form of Why/How dialogues. Making an initial statement that the reader doesn't know will automatically raise a logical question in his mind. <em>How is that possible?</em> <em>Why do you say that?</em> In your following answers, you're likely to tell him other details he doesn't know and this will raise further questions that you're going to answer. And so on.</p>
<p>The author will continue to write, raising and answering questions, until he reaches a point at which he judges the reader will have no more logical questions.</p>
<p>The vertical relationship of a why/how dialogue helps capture the reader's attention. It permits you, as an author, to establish an inner dialog that will pull him with great interest through your reasoning. The reader will be forced to respond logically to your ideas.</p>
<p>As you can see we've not made a full circle. We're now in the (previously discussed) unbundling part.</p>
<h2 id="examples-of-good-business-writing"><a href="#examples-of-good-business-writing" aria-label="examples of good business writing permalink"></a>Examples of Good Business Writing</h2>
<p>Armed with our SCQA framework and the Why/How vertical development, let's look at the skeleton of some real examples.</p>

<p>It's one of the most common examples. common examples. A salesperson, after speaking with a customers, irrupts in the #product or #engineering Slack channels requesting the implementation of a given feature.</p>
<p>If you've been in this position, here's how you can Minto-ize an internal feature request for your product:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Situation:</em>
We have never allowed customers to customize XYZ in order to keep complexity low.</p>
<p><em>Complication:</em>
However, competitor X has now shipped such a customization feature, and we’ve been losing deals because of that.</p>
<p><em>Questions:</em>
We now need to decide whether we want to allow some kind of customization as well.</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em>
[...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Directives are the most common internal memo. Executives write them to request something of someone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Situation:</em>&nbsp;
As you know we're repositioning product <em>x</em> for mid-sized enterprise. We need to teach you how to see <em>x</em> for organizations between 100 and 200 employees.</p>
<p><em>Complication:</em>
We've never sold to this type of customer before. Hence, we need to construct a new customer profile from scratch</p>
<p><em>Questions:</em> (How can we do the profile?)</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em>
We're going to host:</p>

                <section id="post-body">
                    <p>If you are desperate for 6% smaller Go binaries, this blog post is for you. (I did this experiment to help out <a href="https://www.tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a>. Disclosure: I'm an investor.) If binary size doesn't worry you, well, maybe you'll find it entertaining.</p>
<p>In order to get example numbers for this post, I grabbed a random item from my GOPATH. All the hard numbers in this blog post are for <code>github.com/mvdan/sh/cmd/shfmt</code>. From a bit of experimenting, they seem fairly representative.</p>
<p>I am using <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/commit/9d812cfa5c">commit 9d812cfa5c</a> of the Go toolchain as my base commit. This is the <code>master</code> branch as of April 29, 2020; it will probably be similar to the Go 1.15beta1 release. I'm using it rather than Go 1.14 because it contains several binary size reductions, including <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/230544">one in particular</a> that you'll definitely want if you're concerned about binary sizes.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are lots of ways to shrink a binary. Removing extraneous dependencies is probably the best way. <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/210284">Avoiding global maps through judicious use of sync.Once</a> can help. <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/228111">Keeping separable code separate by indirection</a> can help. You can <a href="https://twitter.com/bradfitz/status/1255704982893912064">suppress equality algorithm generation</a> (ick…until you really need it). You can usually save double-digit percentages by stripping debugging information: pass <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38777"><code>-ldflags=-w</code> to <code>go build</code></a>.</p>
<p>Let's assume you've done all that. And you still need to shrink more. And that need is so pressing you're willing to make some sacrifices for it.</p>
<p>Go binaries contain a lot more than just executable code. There are type descriptors that describe the types in a Go program. There are garbage collection data structures. There's debugger information. And there are mappings from PCs to position information. (And there's lots more, too.)</p>
<p>We're going to get rid of the position information.</p>
<hr>
<p>We can't just strip out the position information entirely from the binary. That would break lots of stuff.</p>
<p>But we can make all the line numbers the same. That shouldn't break anything. After all, no one (except gofmt) said we had to put our code on multiple lines.</p>
<p>For example, instead of <a href="https://play.golang.org/">this</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
	<span>"fmt"</span>
)

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
	<span>fmt</span>.<span>Println</span>(<span>"Hello, playground"</span>)
}
</code></pre></div><p>We could write <a href="https://play.golang.org/p/skI5nMleZgt">this</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> ( <span>"fmt"</span> ); <span>func</span> <span>main</span>() { <span>fmt</span>.<span>Println</span>(<span>"Hello, playground"</span>) }
</code></pre></div><p>The Go compiler and runtime has to be prepared for lots of stuff to be on one line.</p>
<p>We could write a preprocessor, maybe using <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Compile_packages_and_dependencies"><code>-toolexec</code></a> and <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/compile/#hdr-Compiler_Directives"><code>//line</code> directives</a>, but it's easier to just hack the compiler. Fortunately, this is well-factored code, so we only need to touch two little spots.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>--- a/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/pos.go

</code></pre></div><p>Every file is now named <code>x.go</code>, and every source position has line 1 and column 1. (Columns don't actually matter for binary size, once you've stripped DWARF.)</p>
<p>This isn't quite enough. There are two other spots in the toolchain that get unhappy if all code lives at <code>x.go:1:1</code>.</p>
<p>The first is in <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38698">constructing DWARF</a>, for debuggers. We can just remove that check: We are already stripping DWARF, so generating invalid DWARF doesn't matter.</p>
<p>The second is in cgo. There are some security checks about where certain cgo pragma can be located. We're going to trust ourselves not to violate them (by ensuring all code keeps building with an unaltered toolchain), and remove that security check.</p>
<p>The full diff is at <a href="https://github.com/josharian/go/commit/1a3e66ceed">https://github.com/josharian/go/commit/1a3e66ceed</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now all code we compile has <code>x.go:1:1</code> as its position.</p>
<p>Our program, compiled with <code>-ldflags=-w</code>, shrinks from 3,126,800 bytes to 2,938,384 bytes, or about 6%.</p>
<p>Most of this is from shrinking the encoding of position information. A little bit of it comes from a compiler optimization.</p>
<p>These two programs compile slightly differently:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>f</span>(<span>x</span> []<span>byte</span>) {
    <span>_</span> = <span>x</span>[<span>0</span>]
    <span>_</span> = <span>x</span>[<span>1</span>]
}
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>f</span>(<span>x</span> []<span>byte</span>) {
    <span>_</span>, <span>_</span> = <span>x</span>[<span>0</span>], <span>x</span>[<span>1</span>]
}
</code></pre></div><p>If you run <code>go tool compile -S x.go</code> on each of these files, you'll see that <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/UFf2JL">the first program</a> contains two separate calls to <code>runtime.panicIndex</code>. <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/26rRog">The second program</a> contains only one such call. The reason is that <code>runtime.panicIndex</code> must display a backtrace containing the line number of the line that panicked. In the first program, we need two separate panics, one for each possible panicking line number. In the second program, we don't, so the compiler combines them.</p>
<p>Since we are now putting all code on the same line, the compiler can combine more panics than before.</p>
<hr>
<p>What do we lose by doing this? Anything that needs accurate position information. Panic backtraces will still show you the PC, the function, the arguments, and so on. But all line numbers will be <code>x.go:1</code>. With patience, you could still figure out the line number yourself based on the PC, but it'd take some manual work. Pprof will still be able to analyze performance by function and by instruction, but it'll think everything happens on the same line, which will make analysis by line number useless.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let's play around a bit. What if we ditch only filenames, and keep the true line numbers? It saves only 0.9%. And as you'd then expect, keeping only accurate filenames and making all line number 1 saves 5.1%.</p>
<p>So most of the savings are from the line numbers. What if we keep the original filenames, and truncate all line numbers to the nearest multiple of 16? That is, trim our diff down to:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>--- a/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/pos.go
</span><span></span><span>+++ b/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/pos.go
</span><span></span><span>@@ -23,3 +23,3 @@ type Pos struct {

</span><span></span><span>+func MakePos(base *PosBase, line, col uint) Pos { return Pos{base, sat32(line/16*16 + 1), 1} }
</span></code></pre></div><p>This cuts our binaries by 2.2%. Not bad. What if we divide all line numbers by 16 instead? That preserves exactly the same information as truncating, but we have to multiply by hand to get the “nearby” line number.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>--- a/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/pos.go

</span></code></pre></div><p>This cuts our binaries by 2.75%! Why does <code>/16</code> save 0.5% more than <code>/16*16</code>?</p>
<p>Line numbers are stored in the binary using a <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/binary/#PutVarint">varint encoding</a> relative to the previous line number. Smaller numbers mean smaller deltas, and can thus be stored more efficiently.</p>

      I bought my first PC in the Spring of 1993.  It was not the first 
      computer I bought, but it was the first useful one.  Between contract 
      engineering jobs at the time, I wanted to spend my time 
      productively by learning the increasingly-popular C++ computer 
      language.  So, I responded to a want-ad placed in the local 
      newspaper by an individual selling a several-year-old 
      personal computer clone with an 80286 CPU.</p>

   <p>Sometime in the late 1970's, the phrase "personal computer" began to 
      supersede "microcomputer" as the generic term for a computer marketed 
      to individuals.  I and many others were annoyed when IBM hijacked 
      "personal computer" and used it as the brand name of their 
      computer, as if no 
      other personal computers had existed before they created the first.  
      Today, almost all desktop and laptop personal computers are PC clones, 
      and no one has used the term "microcomputer" in decades.</p>

   <p>I drove my beaten-up Toyota pickup 20 miles North to the seller's 
      tract home in a suburb of the city.  On his dining room 
      table sat a computer in a tan rectangular metal case.  In those days, 
      computers were all about the technology, not the looks.  Just about 
      the only computers not in tan rectangular metal cases were Apple 
      computers, and they were not much more attractive.  I think the seller 
      sold computers as a side business, because I saw a couple of them 
      lined up against the wall.  The computer that I had come to buy only had 
      512 KB of memory, but I explained to the seller that I needed more to 
      run Turbo C++.  So, he opened the case and added an ISA card with six 
      more 256 KB simms of RAM.  I handed him $240 in twenty-dollar bills 
      and walked out with the computer, DOS 4.01 on 5.25 inch floppies, and 
      a monochrome amber monitor.</p>

   <p>In 1993 the sum of $240 seemed like a lot to pay for a computer that 
      old.  Younger readers must understand that, at a time when 
      CPU's were doubling in power about every 18 months, a computer that 
      was a few years old was viewed as not much more than junk.  In 
      hindsight, this was one of the best purchases I have ever made, 
      because that PC started me down a road that changed my attitude about 
      computers.  At this point in my life, computers had become headaches 
      that I was forced to endure in my job as an engineer.  Owning a PC that 
      I could use for my own purposes changed that paradigm for me and put 
      me on the road to loving computers.  My emotional attachment to 
      computers is actually more complicated than simple love.  Perhaps not 
      what I would call a love/hate relationship.  More like being in love 
      with someone with bipolar disorder.  Buying my first PC all those 
      years ago put me on the path that has ultimately led to the creation 
      of the Cheapskate's Guide website.</p>

   <p>After I brought my PC home, I went to a local bookstore and bought 
      a book called <i>Object-Oriented Programming in Turbo C++</i> by 
      Robert Lafore.  Then, I purchased a Borland Turbo C++ compiler for 
      $90 and went to work learning how to write C++ code.  I read through 
      the thick, Turbo C++ manual that came with the compiler and Lafore's 
      book and tried many of the programming problems.  A few months later, 
      I was ready for the next step.</p>

   <p>I knew the best way to learn to write code was to pick a project that 
      would take a few months to complete.  I also knew the project had to 
      be both fun and challenging enough to motivate me to stick with it.  
      So, I decided to write a graphical flight simulator.  I immediately 
      realized that I would have to upgrade my PC.</p>

   <p>To give younger readers an idea of how slow computers were in those 
      days, the ISA bus that was connected to the RAM card in my first PC 
      ran at 8 MHz.  Today's DDR4 memory runs at well over a gigahertz and 
      makes two memory transfers per clock cycle.  So, today's newer 
      computers access RAM in the neighborhood of 300 times faster than my 
      first PC.  The fastest modern CPU's are around 
      <a href="http://www.roylongbottom.org.uk/linpack%20results.htm">four 
      orders of magnitude</a> faster than the 286.  Even the CPU in a 
      Raspberry Pi 3 is around three orders of magnitude faster than a 286.</p>

   <p>I had difficulty finding a 386-compatible motherboard with eight, 
      30-pin simm slots that would allow me to avoid buying new RAM.  By the 
      time 386 CPU's came out, the computer industry had begun transitioning 
      from 30 and 32-pin simms to 72-pin simms.  I finally found a local 
      computer business willing to sell me a used motherboard with the simm 
      slots I needed and a 386 SX-25 CPU for $35.  The problem of shifting 
      technologies and standards was huge, even back then, because it meant 
      that upgrading a desktop computer not only meant replacing the CPU, 
      motherboard, and RAM.  It sometimes meant buying a new hard drive, 
      internal cards, monitor, and other peripherals.</p>

   <p>Not until I removed the RAM from the 286 motherboard did I discover 
      that I had another problem.  The RAM slots on the new motherboard had two 
      banks of four simm slots each.  If I could not fill the second bank of 
      four completely, it would not work.  Unfortunately the two simms that 
      were attached directly to the 286 motherboard had actual pins soldered 
      to their contacts that fit into holes in connectors on the 286 
      motherboard.  Without those two simms, I would only be able to fill 
      one bank of simm slots on the new motherboard, resulting in only half 
      as much memory, not enough to run Turbo C++.  So, I would have to 
      de-solder the pins on those two simms before I could transfer them to 
      slots on the new motherboard.  Since I was new to computers in those 
      days, I was not 100% sure the simms would be compatible with the 386
      motherboard.  Even if they were, I assumed that I would damage them in 
      some way during the de-soldering process.  So, I was shocked when the new 
      motherboard booted up successfully and recognized all eight simms.</p>

   <p>By today's standards, my first PC had an impossibly stingy 20 MB, 
      5.25" hard drive.  I remember replacing it with a used 80 MB hard 
      drive that I bought for $85 at a local store that sold mostly used 
      computers and parts.  I was happy with that purchase, because 80 
      megabytes of space felt so roomy compared to my old hard drive.</p>

   <p>Walking along the isles of that particular computer store was like 
      panning for gold.  I never knew what treasures I might discover.  Old 
      and in some cases very old desktop computers lined bottom shelves all 
      over the store.  Today those old Vic-20's, Commodor 64's, TI-99/4A's, 
      TRS-80's, TRS-80 Color Computers, and a few that were so old that I 
      could not even identify them would be called Vintage.  But in the mid 
      1990's, they were one step away from the land-fill, too old to be 
      useful, even to me.  Used laptop computers were stacked on eye-level 
      shelves above the desktop computers.  Large cardboard boxes filled 
      with motherboards, sound cards, video cards, and other parts pulled 
      from old computers occupied the bottom shelf of one isle of the 
      store.  A shelf close to the ceiling on the east wall held a row of 
      assorted used monochrome and color CRT monitors.  The wide adoption 
      of LCD monitors by consumers was, I believe, still another five or 
      more years away.  I chose my first color VGA monitor from that shelf.  
      Its resolution was only 640x480, but that was sufficient for my needs 
      at the time.  If I remember correctly, I paid about $100 for that 
      monitor, which is coincidentally about what I paid for the 23" IPS 
      monitor that I bought from Best Buy three years ago.  I found an ISA 
      video card to interface with the VGA monitor in one of the large 
      cardboard boxes of video cards.</p>

   <p>As my flight simulator progressed, my 386 computer quickly 
      became unbearably slow.  The graphics capability of the combination 
      of the 386 CPU and ISA video card was not fast enough to produce more 
      than one or two frames per second.  I was forced to upgrade again.  
      This time, I went with a Trident PCI video card and a motherboard 
      with a 486 DX-66 CPU, which forced me to buy new 72-pin RAM.</p>

   <p>I spent a total of six months writing my flight simulator during two 
      periods of unemployment.  It went surprising well, and I learned much 
      about C++ coding, computer memory models, video memory, and 
      hardware interrupts.  Soon, I found myself looking for 
      intermediate-level C++ books, and not finding many.</p>

   <p>To make a long story short, I kept the case and power supply of my 
      first PC for 13 years as I upgraded through 4 motherboards, DOS 5.0, 
      DOS 6.11, Windows 95, and Windows 98.  Eventually, I grew tired of 
      lugging the heavy case around the country as I moved from job to job, 
      and I let go of the case and power supply.  However, I held on to the 
      original 8, 256 KB simms of RAM.  You can see them in the picture at 
      the top of this article.  Sometimes, I wish I still had that case and 
      power supply for nostalgic reasons, but as with most material things 
      that have outlived their usefulness, I could not justify keeping 
      them around.  Luckily, websites have no weight and never outlive their 
      usefulness, because they are infinitely upgradable.</p>

          <p>Modern application requirements have pushed beyond the limitations of DBMS (relational database management systems). NoSQL databases play an important role in cloud software applications, they store data in a format other than relational tables that does not require a fixed schema, they come in a variety of types based on their data model.</p>

<p>There are four main types of databases in the NoSQL (stands for “Not Only SQL” or “Not SQL.”):  key-value pair based, wide column, document-oriented and graph-based.</p>

<p>Both TerminusDB and MongoDB are NoSQL databases, both store data as documents, both have a flexible data model, that means that the database schema is flexible and can evolve in the time when the user exigences change, both databases support a rich query language, but TerminusDB is a <strong>version control document system</strong> and a <strong>graph database</strong> as well.</p>

<p>Now let’s see the main differences between TerminusDB and MongoDB in practice.</p>

<p>if you have never used TerminusDB before, this article includes everything you need to get started with TerminusDB.

<p><em>Note: We are assuming that you already are familiar with MongoDB.</em></p>

<h2 id="the-dataset">The Dataset</h2>

<p>First look at our dataset, which data we need to store and how this data is related to each other.</p>

<p>In our examples we use the collection of data about the bike journeys between stations in Washington D.C., USA.</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/bike_table.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The CSV data used this tutorial is available at <a href="https://terminusdb.com/t/data/bike_tutorial.csv">https://terminusdb.com/t/data/bike_tutorial.csv</a></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="query-language">Query language</h2>

<p>MongoDB uses the MongoDB Query Language (<strong>MQL</strong>) for accessing the documents.</p>

<p>In TerminusDB we use <a href="https://terminusdb.com/docs/woql"><strong>WOQL</strong> (Web Object Query Language)</a>. It is a unified model query language, WOQL’s primary syntax and interchange format is in JSON-LD.
All our example are writing using woql.js a javascript layer that help you to compose WOQL query.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="create-schema">Create Schema</h2>

<p>MongoDB stores data as JSON-like documents. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) documents support embedded fields, so documents can store related information (data or list of data) together, fields can vary from document to document.</p>

<p>You can insert a document in the collection and MongoDB creates that collection on the fly or maybe you can create a collection with a schema validation before .</p>

<p>Let’s see how to create a new collection with specified validation rules. Here a fragment 
for mongoshell:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We have created our <strong>journey</strong> collection with embedded  the <strong>start_station</strong> and <strong>end_station</strong> data entities (station_number,address) in the journey collection data. For many use cases in MongoDB, the denormalized data model is optimal.</p>

<p>In TerminusDB we have documents as well, so for our dataset we prefer to create three different documents: Station, Journey and Bicycle, every document has a label and a description and is identified by an unique URL. In our documents we have properties to describe the type of data and the documents are related to each other.  Following the link between the documents we can track the relationship between connected data for example <strong>Station</strong> - <em>many</em> - <strong>Journey</strong>.</p>

<p>An example of relationship between documents written in woql.js</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>WOQL</span><span>.</span><span>when</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>).</span><span>and</span><span>(</span>

<span>…</span><span>...)</span>         

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>In the <strong>Journey</strong> document the range data type of the <strong>start_station</strong> and <strong>end_station</strong> properties (ObjectProperty) are the <strong>Station</strong> document.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="load-data">Load Data</h2>

<p>In MongoDB you can’t import a csv file in the journey collection directly. 
We could use mongoimport.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
mongoimport <span>--db</span><span>=</span>mybike <span>--collection</span><span>=</span>journey <span>--type</span><span>=</span>csv  <span>--ignoreBlanks</span> <span>--headerline</span> <span>--file</span><span>=</span><span>"./bike_tutorial.csv"</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But the result will be a different collection schema</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>
</span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>"_id"</span><span>:</span><span>"ObjectId(5f05f055c74146b286a61cf0)"</span><span>,</span><span>

   </span><span>"End date"</span><span>:</span><span>"2018-12-01 00:19:52"</span><span>,</span><span>
   </span><span>"Start station number"</span><span>:</span><span>31202</span><span>,</span><span>
   </span><span>"Start station"</span><span>:</span><span>"14th &amp; R St NW"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>........</span><span>}</span><span>

</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>if you like to create the documents from the csv file inside the collection <strong>journey</strong> you have to implement your custom solution, maybe you could using javascript for import the data from the csv file ( csvtojson is a node.js library) and <strong>mongodb</strong> the official MongoDB driver for Node.js to insert the data into the collection.</p>

<p>Here one example to insert a document inside the journey collection using <em>mongoshell</em>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>

<p>In TerminusDB we have a very cleaner solution to import csv files into the database, with a data integrity check for any newly imported records. We use the woql.js layer for write the query statement to load the data from the csv file.</p>

<p>A fragment of an import query.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>

<p>We use <strong>WOQL.as(a,b)</strong> to refer the first row of our csv file that contain the column headers in our variables, for example the field <strong>Start station number</strong> refers the variable <strong>v:Start_ID</strong> and the  <strong>Start station</strong> refers the variable <strong>v:Start_Station</strong></p>

<p>With WOQL.insert() we insert  the data inside our database. We create a <strong>Station</strong> document for every <strong>v:Start_station_URL</strong> and <strong>v:End_station_URL</strong> value and we link this value inside the <strong>start_station</strong> and <strong>end_station</strong> properties in the Journey document. The relationship between journey document and station document  has been created. The relationship allows TerminusDB to normalize the data across multiple documents.❗

<h2 id="query-the-data">Query the Data</h2>

<p>Here is an example of query operations using the db.collection.find() method in mongoshell, we select from the <strong>journey</strong> collection all documents where the status <strong>bike_id</strong> equals <strong>W21477</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/query-mongo.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Remember that TerminusDB is a graph-database, this means that TerminusDB
creates relationships between the documents and properties inside documents.
TerminusDB can analyze and traverse complex relationships between connected data structures. Let’s keep to practise❗</p>

<h2 id="so-what-s-a-regular-expression-">So, what's a Regular Expression?</h2>
<p><em>A regular expression (shortened as <strong>regex</strong> or <strong>regexp</strong>) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation.</em> (Wikipedia)</p>
<p>So, basically, a regular expression is made up of a series of characters (be it special characters like <code>/</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>*</code>, alphabets and numbers) that defines a pattern. This pattern is usually used for finding text, and for validating input values. Here are two scenarios where you'd need a regular expression:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You have a very long string in which you want to check if any e-mail addresses exist. You couldn't use any ordinary address because you don't know which address may be in the string. You just want to know if there's any e-mail address at all in the string. How do you do that? You simply create a regular expression defining the pattern which all e-mail addresses follow, and then check if there's any match in the string.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A user enters a name in an input field you provided. As a front-end developer your job is to validate the data on the client-side before the server also does it. Regular expressions provide a way to check if the data entered by the user is exact, or follows the pattern of data that's required. For instance, an input field that expects a name of a person shouldn't contain digits or special characters apart from a hyphen.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Regular expressions can be defined in two ways: using the built-in <code>RegExp</code> constructor, or defining it as a literal value with double forward slashes - <code>//</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Option 1: <code>new RegExp()</code></li>
</ol>
<pre><code><span>let</span> regex = <span>new</span> <span>RegExp</span>(<span>"pattern"</span>, <span>"flags"</span>);
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Option 2: using forward slashes - <code>//</code></li>
</ol>
<pre><code><span>let</span> regex = <span>/pattern/</span>flags;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Where <code>pattern</code> is the pattern you intend to find;</li>
<li>and <code>flags</code> are optional tokens that add more functionality when finding the pattern you're trying to match. </li>
</ul>
<p>We'll cover flags in a bit, but for now, let's understand some fundamentals of creating patterns.</p>

<p>We're going to play with some regular expressions and learn how to use the <code>str.match()</code> and <code>regexp.test()</code> methods to determine whether or not a string matches a pattern. Here's our first example:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> string = <span>"Hello world!"</span>;



<span>let</span> rgxp1 = <span>new</span> <span>RegExp</span>(<span>"Hello"</span>);
<span>let</span> rgxp2 = <span>/Hello/</span>;


<span>console</span>.log(string.match(rgxp1));




<span>console</span>.log(rgxp2.test(string));


</code></pre>
<h3 id="explanation">Explanation</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>We defined two different regular expressions with different syntaxes but with the same pattern. You realised that the <code>flags</code> part was omitted in both expressions. It's optional; we only include it when we need special functionality, which we'll discuss in a second. 😉</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code>str.match()</code> method accepts a regular expression as an argument. This is possible because regular expressions are integrated with string methods. So, you invoke the <code>match()</code> method on the string on which you want to run the pattern search; in our case, the <code>string</code> variable. You then pass the regular expression, which defines the pattern you want to search, as an argument to the <code>match()</code> method. If there's a match, it returns an array of substrings which matched the pattern; else, if there isn't a match, the method returns <code>null</code>. But in our example, the sub-string "Hello" in the string "Hello world!" is matched. There are additional properties attached to the returned array: <code>index</code>, <code>input</code>, <code>groups</code>. The <code>index</code> property holds the index in the target string where a pattern match was obtained; the <code>input</code> property holds a copy of the target string itself, thus <code>"Hello world!"</code>; the <code>groups</code> property hold <strong>groups</strong> captured in the regular expression, which, in our our case, is <code>undefined</code> because we didn't define any groups in the expression. Don't worry, we'll discuss groups too. 😃 So, with this result, it's clear that the <code>str.match()</code> method returns detailed description of the pattern search.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code>regexp.test()</code> method, however, is invoked on the regular expression which defines the pattern, and the target string is rather passed as an argument to it. Unlike the <code>str.match()</code> method which returns a detailed information about the search, the <code>regexp.test()</code> method returns a Boolean: <code>true</code> if the pattern was found in the string; <code>false</code> if not. In our case, <code>true</code> was returned because obviously <code>Hello</code> can be found in the string "Hello world!".</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The text <code>Hello</code> in between the forward slashes <code>//</code>, and string "Hello" passed to the <code>RegExp</code> constructor as an argument, are all simple examples of patterns in a regular expression. If you want to find a string which has the word "metal", you could define your pattern as <code>/metal/</code> or <code>new RegExp("metal")</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, what if we run the search on the string <code>"hello world!"</code> instead of <code>"Hello world!"</code> (Notice the uppercase "H")?</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> string = <span>"hello world!"</span>;

<span>let</span> rgxp = <span>/Hello/</span>;


<span>console</span>.log(rgxp.test(string));


</code></pre>
<p>Wait, what? 😕🤔 We had no match! That's because regular expressions, by default, are case sensitive. Meaning, an uppercase "H" is not the same as a lowercase "h".</p>
<p>And what if we run the search on the string <code>"Hello Hello world!"</code>? It should match it twice right? Let's find out:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> string = <span>"Hello Hello world!"</span>;

<span>let</span> rgxp = <span>/Hello/</span>;



<span>console</span>.log(string.match(rgxp));


</code></pre>
<p>Oops! The same result. Notice it matched at the <code>index</code> of <code>0</code>; meaning it matched only the first <code>Hello</code> and then it stopped searching.</p>
<p>Let's modify these behaviours with <strong>Flags</strong>. 😉</p>

<p>Flags, in regular expressions, are tokens that modify the searching behaviour of the regular expression. Flags are optional, as mentioned earlier, and they make it possible to alter the default behaviour of regular expressions. For instance, by default regular expressions are case sensitive. Meaning the pattern <code>/Abc/</code> will not match the string <code>"abc"</code>. </p>
<p>There are only six flags in JavaScript and they're denoted by single alphabets. Here they are:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Flag</td><td>Name</td><td>Description</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>i</strong></td><td>Ignore case</td><td>Makes the expression search case-insensitively.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>g</strong></td><td>Global</td><td>Makes the expression search globally in the string, matching not only the first pattern, but all patterns in the string.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>s</strong></td><td>Dot All</td><td>Ensures the special character <code>.</code> matches newlines.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>m</strong></td><td>Multiline</td><td>Ensures the boundary characters <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> match the beginning and ending of every single line instead of the beginning and ending of the whole string.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>y</strong></td><td>Sticky</td><td>Makes the expression start its searching from the index indicated in its <code>lastIndex</code> property.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>u</strong></td><td>Unicode</td><td>Enables support for unicode.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="the-i-flag">The <code>i</code> Flag</h2>
<p>Using this flag on a regular expression changes its default case-sensitive behaviour to case-insensitive.</p>
<p>Now, let's match the string <code>"hello world!"</code> even though our pattern is defined with an uppercase "H":</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> string = <span>"hello world!"</span>;



<span>let</span> rgxp = <span>/Hello/i</span>;



<span>console</span>.log(rgxp.test(string));


</code></pre>
<p>With the <strong><code>i</code></strong> flag, the pattern <code>/AbC/i</code> will match the string <code>"abc"</code>.</p>
<h2 id="the-g-flag">The <code>g</code> Flag</h2>
<p>In our previous example where we tried matching the pattern <code>/Hello/</code> on the string <code>"Hello Hello world!"</code>, we only got one match, which is the first in the string. With the <strong><code>g</code></strong> flag, we can match all patterns in the string and not only the first:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> string = <span>"Hello Hello world!"</span>;

<span>let</span> rgxp = <span>/Hello/g</span>;





<span>console</span>.log(string.match(rgxp));


</code></pre>
<p>Note that, with the <strong><code>g</code></strong> flag, we don't get the additional properties <code>index</code>, <code>input</code>, and <code>groups</code>.</p>
<p>You can use several flags at the same time, too:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> string = <span>"Hello hello world!"</span>;



<span>let</span> rgxp = <span>/Hello/gi</span>;



<span>console</span>.log(rgxp.test(string)); 
</code></pre>

<p>Sets and Ranges provide a way to determine whether or not a character, from a <em>set of characters</em>, is matched at a given position.</p>
<h2 id="sets">Sets</h2>
<p><strong>Character sets</strong> are used to match one from several characters at a give position in a pattern.</p>
<p>Say you want to match these words: "sell", "tell", "fell", "yell". The words may be more than 4; but let's assume they have the same pattern; like with the 4 words above, they all end with "ell". The only thing different is their initial character. With <strong>character sets</strong>, we can define a <em>set</em> of these initial characters at the <em>position</em> where only a single one of them is needed, and then add the remaining parts of the pattern that's static.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To define a set of characters in a regular expression, enclose those characters in brackets <code>[]</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="example-1">Example 1</h3>
<p>So, for the four words "sell", "tell", "fell", "yell", we define the set of their initials as <code>[stfy]</code>, followed by their last characters <code>ell</code>:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> expr = <span>/[stfy]ell/i</span>;

<span>let</span> words = [<span>"sell"</span>, <span>"tell"</span>, <span>"fell"</span>, <span>"yell"</span>, <span>"bell"</span>, <span>"well"</span>];


<span>for</span> (<span>let</span> word <span>of</span> words) {
  <span>console</span>.log(<span>`Matched "<span>${word}</span>" :::: `</span>, expr.test(word));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Result:</p>
<pre><code><span>Matched</span> <span>"sell"</span> ::::  <span>true</span>
Matched <span>"tell"</span> ::::  <span>true</span>
Matched <span>"fell"</span> ::::  <span>true</span>
Matched <span>"yell"</span> ::::  <span>true</span>
Matched <span>"bell"</span> ::::  <span>false</span>
Matched <span>"well"</span> ::::  <span>false</span>
</code></pre><p>It is observed that, the first four strings in the array are perfect matches, but the last two aren't. That's because the last two have their initials to be <code>b</code> and <code>w</code>, which were not defined in the character set.</p>
<h3 id="example-2">Example 2</h3>
<p>Let's match either "odd" or "add". Both words end with "dd", but they both begin with different characters, "o" and "a".</p>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> expr = <span>/[oa]dd/i</span>;

<span>let</span> strings = [<span>"Odd"</span>, <span>"Let's add 2 and 3."</span>];


<span>for</span> (<span>let</span> string <span>of</span> strings) {
  <span>console</span>.log(<span>`Matched "<span>${string}</span>" :::: `</span>, expr.test(string));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Result:</p>
<pre><code><span>Matched</span> <span>"Odd"</span> ::::  <span>true</span>
Matched <span>"Let's add the 2 and 3."</span> ::::  <span>true</span>
</code></pre><p>Our <code>test()</code> method matched the <code>"Odd"</code> string (with an …</p></div></div>

<p>Just under two months ago <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://opennebula.io/introducing-opennebula-enterprise-edition/" target="_blank">we announced the Enterprise Edition</a> of the OpenNebula software bringing a more tested, hardened, and production-ready version of OpenNebula for enterprise use—by OpenNebula Systems. And quickly following that, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://opennebula.io/ee-maintenance-release-v-5-12-1-is-available/" target="_blank">first maintenance version</a> of the 5.12 Enterprise Edition was released just a month later.</p>



<figure><ul><li><figure><img src="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EE_Release_Cycle-1-1024x646.png" alt="" data-id="26003" data-full-url="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EE_Release_Cycle-1.png" data-link="https://opennebula.io/?attachment_id=26003" srcset="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EE_Release_Cycle-1-1024x646.png 1024w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EE_Release_Cycle-1-300x189.png 300w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EE_Release_Cycle-1-768x484.png 768w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EE_Release_Cycle-1-1536x969.png 1536w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EE_Release_Cycle-1.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></li></ul></figure>







<p>Today, we are glad to announce an additional development in our enterprise product release cycle: the introduction of new <strong>LTS versions</strong> to reduce the risk, expense, and disruption of software deployment. Approximately every 6 months, each OpenNebula major or minor version will be either LTS (Long Term Support) or STS (Short Term Support).</p>



<p>Customers can choose to use LTS or STS releases according to their discretion:</p>



<ul><li>An <strong>STS version</strong> will be maintained and technically supported for a period of <strong>7 months</strong>. This incorporates the 6 months until the next main version (LTS or STS) is available, plus an additional month thereafter. These are production-quality releases that serve as a proving ground for new capabilities by customers interested in adopting new major features and are able to perform upgrades multiple times a year.</li><li>An <strong>LTS version</strong> will be maintained and technically supported for a period of <strong>at least 27 months</strong>. This incorporates the time until the next LTS is available (which is at least for 18 months, but could be for longer), plus an additional 9 months thereafter. LTS releases are the “enterprise grade” releases of OpenNebula and are intended to be utilized primarily in production environments by customers interested in a release family with an extended support cycle.</li></ul>



<p>From its 7th month, the LTS releases enter into “Maintenance Support” in which they will receive only critical and compatible fixes throughout their lifecycle, (no additional minor enhancements). And the last 3 months of an LTS release support overlaps with the beginning of “Maintenance Support” for the subsequent LTS release. This provides a simple way for customers who are averse to too many changes to remain in the maintenance and extended support phases with no minor features across two LTS releases.</p>



<p>The newly-released <a href="http://opennebula.org/firework" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenNebula 5.12 “Firework”</a> is our first LTS version with an expected EOL of <strong>September 15, 2022</strong>. The EOL of the 5.10 version will be September 15, 2020, which is in alignment with the former policy. And for those customers that have the need to maintain support for a version beyond the EOL date, we offer an “Extended Life Support” extension to do just that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This advancement in our Release Life Cycle Policy will provide users of the Enterprise Edition more flexibility in their software maintenance planning.</p>

<![CDATA[Verified commits: sign your Git commits and avoid impersonation risk]]>

July 21, 2020 | https://www.pauldowman.com/posts/signing-git-commits-with-gpg | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.pauldowman.com/posts/signing-git-commits-with-gpg">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A Git commit’s author might not be who you think it is.</p>
<p>I’m old enough to remember when it was easy to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoofing_attack">spoof</a> the email sender (send fake email that appears to come from someone else). In the early days of the Internet most people didn’t even realize it was possible, so they were easy victims. </p>
<p>Email is delivered by SMTP, an open protocol, which is what has allowed it to flourish as a global, distributed system. But it was also designed without built-in cryptographic verification of the sender (in fact it was illegal to export cryptography from the US until 1992!). Now we have protection against this, such as SPF and DKIM, and most email services will warn you if the sender isn’t verified (or at least that it doesn’t come from the domain that it claims to).</p>
<p>But today <strong>a Git commit author is just as easily spoofed as email was in the 90s</strong>. Like email, Git is a global, distributed system, and by default it also doesn’t have built-in cryptographic verification of the author’s identity.</p>
<p>So how can you be sure that all commits are really from the author that you think they’re from? GitHub accounts can be compromised and malicious code can be hidden in pull requests (e.g. malicious packages added in hidden lockfile diffs, homoglyph changes to package names or domain names, changes in binaries if you have any in your repo, or maybe just a malicious change that you didn’t notice). </p>
<h3>The solution</h3>
<p>Git supports signing tags and individual commits, and the GitHub UI shows a “verified” label on signed commits:</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://www.pauldowman.com/static/8905b3b65f65e07e9409f3c0db06fa7f/0ad97/verified.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Being sure of commit authors lets you focus more attention on less trusted contributions and it makes incident response a lot easier.</p>
<p>Git also supports rejecting unsigned commits.</p>
<h3>How to</h3>
<p>Here are a few options for setup guides:</p>
<ul>
<li>I would generally follow this <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification">guide from GitHub</a>.</li>
<li>If you’re using OS X <a href="https://gist.github.com/troyfontaine/18c9146295168ee9ca2b30c00bd1b41e">this guide</a> covers installing GPG and includes setting up <code>pinentry-mac</code> for a passphrase entry dialog.</li>
<li>There’s also <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work">the Git docs</a>.</li>
</ul></div></div></div>]]>

July 21, 2020 | https://www.lorenzweiss.de/common_mistakes_react_hooks/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.lorenzweiss.de/common_mistakes_react_hooks/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="react-as-a-framework">React as a framework<a href="#react-as-a-framework" aria-label="react as a framework permalink"></a></h2>
<p>React has been out in the world of web development for quite some time now. Its position as a tool for agile web development has steadily strengthened in recent years. Especially after the announcement and release of the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html#hooks-and-function-components">new hook api/concept</a>, writing components has never been easier.</p>
<p>Although the team behind react and the huge community have tried to train and explain the concepts of the framework in an impressive way, I still see some pitfalls and common mistakes that were made while working with it.
I kept a list of all the mistakes I saw over the last years related to react especially with using hooks. In this article I want to show you the most common ones. I will also try to explain in detail, why I think they are mistakes and a suggestion for doing it in a cleaner way.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Before we start with the list, I have to say that most of the following things are not fundamental mistakes or don't look wrong at first glance. Most of them are unlikely to affect the performance or apperance of the application.
Probably nobody would notice, except for the developers working on the product, that something is wrong here, but I still believe that good quality code can lead to a better developer experience and thus to a better product.</p>
<p>As with any software framework or library, there are millions of different opinions about it. Everything you see here is based on my personal opinion and should not be considered a general rule.
If you have a different opinion about her, I would love to hear it 🌟</p>
<h2 id="1-using-usestate-when-no-rerender-is-needed">1. Using useState when no rerender is needed<a href="#1-using-usestate-when-no-rerender-is-needed" aria-label="1 using usestate when no rerender is needed permalink"></a></h2>
<p>One of the core concepts of react is dealing with state. You can control your entire data flow and rendering through state. Each time the tree is rendered again, it is most likely tied to a change in state.</p>
<p>With the <code>useState</code> hook you can now also define your state in function components. Which is a really neat and easy way how to handle states in react. But it can also be misused as we see in the following example.</p>
<p>For the next example we need a bit of explanation, suppose we have two buttons, one button is a counter and the other button sends a request or triggers an action with the current count. However, the current number is never displayed within the component. It is only required for the request when you click the second button.</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>count<span>,</span> setCount<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClickCount</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setCount</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> c <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClickRequest</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>apiCall</span><span>(</span>count<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClickCount<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Counter</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClickRequest<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Submit</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>At first sight, you might ask what exactly is the problem with that? Isn't that what state was made for?
Sure you are right, this will work just fine and probably there will never be a problem with that. However in react every state change will force a rerender for that component and most likely its children. But in the above example since we never use that state in our render part, this will end up being an unnecessary render every time we set the counter, which can impact the performance or could have unexpected side effects.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>If you want to use a variable inside your component which should keep its value between rendering but also don't force a rerender, you can use the <code>useRef</code> hook. It will keep the value, but doesn't force the component to rerender.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> count <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClickCount</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    count<span>.</span>current<span>++</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClickRequest</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>apiCall</span><span>(</span>count<span>.</span>current<span>)</span><span>;</span>

<p>This might be a very easy and obvious one and not really related to react itself, but I still see it quite a lot when people writing react components.</p>
<p>Let's say you will write a button and with clicking the button the user should be redirected to another page. Since its a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">SPA</a>, this action will be a client-side routing mechanism. So you will need some kind of library for doing that.
In react the most popular one is <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/">react-router</a> and the following example will use that library.</p>
<p>So adding a click listener will redirect the user to the desired page right?</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> history <span>=</span> <span>useHistory</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClick</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    history<span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>'/next-page'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClick<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Go to next page</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>Even though this would work just fine for most of the users, there is a huge problem when it comes to accessibility here. The button will not be marked as linking to another page at all, which makes it nearly impossible to be identified by screen readers.
Also could you open that in a new tab or window? Most likely not.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>Linking to other pages with any user interaction should, where possible, be handled by the <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> component or a normal <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Link</span></span> <span>to</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/next-page<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Go to next page</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Link</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Bonus points:</strong> it also makes the code a lot more readable and shorter!</p>
<h2 id="3-handling-actions-via-useeffect">3. Handling actions via useEffect<a href="#3-handling-actions-via-useeffect" aria-label="3 handling actions via useeffect permalink"></a></h2>
<p>One of the best and most thoughtful hooks introduced by React is the "useEffect" hook. It enables the processing of actions related to <code>prop</code> or <code>state</code> changes.
Despite its helpful functionality, it is also often used in places where it may not be needed.</p>
<p>Imagine a component that fetches a list of items and render them to the dom. In addition, if the request is successful, we would like to call the "onSuccess" function, which is passed on to the component as a prop.</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>DataList</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> onSuccess <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>loading<span>,</span> setLoading<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>There are two <code>useEffect</code> hooks, the first one is handling the api call on the initial render and the second one will call the <code>onSuccess</code> function, by assuming when there is no loading, no error, but data in the state, it must have been a successful call. Makes sense right?</p>
<p>Sure for the first call this is true and probably will never fail. But you also loose the direct connection between the action and the function that needs to be called. There is no guarantee that this case will only happen if the fetch action has succeeded and this is something we as developers really don't like.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>A straight forward solution would be to set the "onSuccess" function to the actual place where the call was successful:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>DataList</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> onSuccess <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>loading<span>,</span> setLoading<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>error<span>,</span> setError<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>data<span>,</span> setData<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>fetchData</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>callApi</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>fetchedData</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>setData</span><span>(</span>fetchedData<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>        <span>onSuccess</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span>      <span>}</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>catch</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setError</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>finally</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fetchData</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span>data<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now it is quite clear at first sight when the onSuccess is called, exactly in the success case of the api call.</p>
<h2 id="4-single-responsibility-components">4. Single responsibility components<a href="#4-single-responsibility-components" aria-label="4 single responsibility components permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Composing components can be hard.
When is it time to split a component into several smaller components?
How do you structure the component tree?
All of these questions arise every day when working with a component-based framework.
However, a common mistake in designing your components is to combine two use cases into a single component.
Let's take an example of a header that shows either a burger button on mobile devices or tabs on desktop screens. (The condition will be handled the the magical <code>isMobile</code> function, which is not part of this example 🧙‍)</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>Header</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> menuItems <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>HeaderInner</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>HeaderInner</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> menuItems <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>isMobile</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>?</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>BurgerButton</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span> <span>:</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Tabs</span></span> <span>tabData</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>With this approach the component HeaderInner is trying to be two different things at once and we all learned from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde">Mr. Jekyll</a>, being more than one thing at a time isn't really ideal.
Also it makes it even harder to test or to reuse the component in other places.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>Bringing the condition one level up, makes it easier to see what the components are made for and that they only have one responsibility, being a <code>Header</code>, <code>Tabs</code> or a <code>BurgerButton</code> and not trying to be two things at once.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>Header</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span><span>isMobile</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>?</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>BurgerButton</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span> <span>:</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Tabs</span></span> <span>tabData</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="5-single-responsibility-useeffects">5. Single responsibility useEffects<a href="#5-single-responsibility-useeffects" aria-label="5 single responsibility useeffects permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Remember the times when we only had the <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code> or <code>componentDidUpdate</code> methods to hook into the rendering process of a react component? It is bringing back dark memories and also realizing the beauty of using the <code>useEffect</code> hook and especially that you can have as much as you want of them.</p>
<p>But sometimes forgetting and using a "useEffect" for several things brings back those dark memories. For example, imagine you have a component that fetches some data from the backend in some way, and also displays breadcrumbs depending on the current location. (Using again <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/">react-router</a> for getting the current location.)</p>

<p>2020-06-21</p>

<p>This is the only old machine that I have kept around. It’s from around
1995, I don’t remember exactly. Despite it’s old age, it’s relatively
powerful:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Pentium with 133 MHz, well, it could be worse.</li>
<li>64 MB RAM. It came with 32 MB and was upgraded later on.</li>
<li>8 GB hard disk.</li>
<li>Behold: An Ethernet adapter.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is slow by today’s standards, but the RAM and the NIC make it
surprisingly useful. 8 GB for a disk is also more than you might think.
It’s one “generation” after DOS (think 8 to 25 MHz, 70 MB disk tops, 4
MB RAM, something like that), it came with Windows 95, and was blazingly
fast back then. It was the first time ever that I saw a <em>video</em> playing
on a computer, while other programs could be run in parallel.</p>
<p>I installed OpenBSD 5.7 a few years ago. Time for an upgrade.</p>
<p>Originally, I expected this to be a very long blog post with a lot of
nasty details. There are some obstacles:</p>
<ul>
<li>The machine does not have USB, yet.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support PXE boot, either.</li>
<li>I don’t own any blank CD-R anymore, so I can’t burn a CD.</li>
<li>It’s 2020 and Coronavirus is all over the place, so I don’t want to
    go out to try to find some place where I can buy CDs or other stuff.
    I can only use what I happen to have lying around.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, how on earth would I be able to update that system?</p>
<p>What I did have lying around were some old 3.5" floppy disks. And much
to my surprise, OpenBSD 6.7 offers a floppy image. I copied it to the
floppy, booted, and … it just worked. It detected the NIC, requested an
IP via DHCP, and then the installer was able to install a brand new
OpenBSD via HTTP.</p>
<p>Holy cow.</p>
<p>What a humbling experience. On one 1.44 MB floppy disk, they have a
working kernel, enough drivers to support my hardware, a working
userland including a DHCP client, and a working installer. In 2020,
where a simple “hello world” in Golang needs over 2 MB of disk space,
this is absolutely mind blowing. Even when compared to other operating
systems from the 1990ies, I feel like this is pretty impressive, because
IBM PC-DOS came on what, 5 floppys? With no notion of networking
whatsoever and virtually zero drivers? But to be honest, that’s so long
ago, I can barely remember anymore what a vanilla PC-DOS felt like and
which features it had, so I might be wrong.</p>
<p>Since there are virtually no technical details to blog about, here are
some photos from the installation process. One of the last ones being me
writing this blog post in X11. And the very last one? That’s <a href="https://www.uninformativ.de/git/katriawm">katriawm</a>,
<a href="https://www.uninformativ.de/git/bevelbar">bevelbar</a>, and (invisible but running) <a href="https://www.uninformativ.de/git/nhkd">nhkd</a>. Whoa.</p>
<p>After the photos, I’ll put some quick configuration notes.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s a GNU Gnu. Deal with it.</p>
<h2>Configuration notes</h2>
<p>OpenBSD creates a unique <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&amp;m=149887978201230">randomized kernel</a> on each boot. On that
old machine, this takes literally an hour. I have disabled both KARL and
library relinking in <code>/etc/rc</code>. This should be done using <code>ed(1)</code>
directly after the installer has finished: It offers you to open a shell
and the filesystem on which you installed is still mounted.</p>
<p>The system has neither USB nor PS/2. I can only attach a serial mouse.
It doesn’t get detected automatically, so I have to create an
<code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Section "ServerFlags"
    Option "AutoAddDevices" "False"
    Option "AllowEmptyInput" "False"
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
    Identifier  "Mouse0"
    Driver      "mouse"
    Option      "Protocol" "Microsoft"
    Option      "Device" "/dev/tty00"
    Option      "ZAxisMapping" "4 5 6 7"
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
    Identifier  "Keyboard0"
    Driver      "kbd"
    Option      "XkbLayout" "de"
EndSection
</code></pre>
<p><code>wsmoused</code> works too (but must not be running when X does), it
needs these flags:</p>
<pre><code>-p /dev/cua00 -t microsoft

				  <p>Sales and customer data provide important insight for companies. Analytics has today an important role in providing data about sales trends, customer profiles, warnings about (un)profitable products, sales volume forecasts and stock supply as well as personalizing customer relationships and giving product recommendations. All this information needs to be delivered in time, preferably in a (semi)automated fashion.<br></p>  <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/published/big-data-dashboard.jpg?1592856241" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <div><p><span size="3">Photo by Stephen Dawson on Unsplash</span></p></div>  <div><p>These data can become large to the point that analytical tools and software have performance issues. For example, many businesses embrace spreadsheet software like Excel for understandable reasons, but it would breakdown with large data. Many data scientist work with Python/R, but modules like Pandas would become slow and run out of memory with large data as well.</p><p>Apache Spark enables large and big data analyses. It does this by using parallel processing using different threads and cores optimally. It can therefore improve performance on a cluster but also on a single machine </p><p><span color="#5040ae">[1]</span>. It can do this for (i) unstructured data such as text or for (ii) structured data such as DataFrames arranged in columns. Spark does not require loading all data into memory before processing and it is faster than for example Hadoop.<br>Spark is a multi-language tool. Interfaces exist for Scala, Java, Python and R users, and it can be used in the cloud. These and other features make it a suitable platform for large scale data analyses. Google trends suggests that PySpark - Spark with a Python interface - enjoys increasing popularity.<br></p></div>  <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/google-trends_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p><span size="3"><span><span>Data source: <strong>Google Trends</strong> (https://www.<strong>google</strong>.com/<strong>trends</strong>).</span></span></span><br></p>  <div><p>The following blog shows a detailed short example using PySpark in the context of the Online retail sales data <span color="#5040ae">[2]</span>. These are data that are arranged in column format, containing for example invoice number, invoice dates, quantity, price and product description. The chosen data serve as an example and the size would still work in Pandas for most single machine users, even though it would be slower.</p><p>The current blog does not provide a benchmark as done previously </p><p><span color="#5040ae">[1]</span>. It rather gives hands-on analytical steps with code (i.e., concatenate data, removal of data records, renaming columns, replacing strings, casting data types, creation of new features, filtering data). It therefore allows a first glimpse into the world of PySpark.<br></p></div>  <div id="863076632288984095"><div><p id="element-4a5854cd-f009-4c87-9cfd-85ac90227db3" data-platform-element-id="919380649307043755-1.0.0">
	

<h2>START PYSPARK &amp; IMPORT MODULES</h2>
</p>
</div></div>  <p>The Jupyter notebook file <em>PySpark-retaildata.ipynb</em>&nbsp; can be found at GitHub <span color="#5040ae">[3]</span>.<br>The notebook can be run in Google Colab. To install PySpark, type in the first cell <span color="#8d7824">!pip install pyspark</span> .<br></p>  <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/pyspark-install_orig.gif" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>An alternative is starting a Docker PySpark notebook <span color="#5040ae">[4]</span>.<br>After PySpark is installed and the Jupyter notebook is up and running, we first need to import the modules and create a Spark session:<br></p>      <p>Note that the Spark version used here is 2.4.5, which can be found by the command <span color="#8d7824">spark.version</span>. At the writing of this text, 3.0.0. is being released.<br></p>  <div id="540407624244840880"><div><p id="element-a3066edb-d72c-4553-8b52-740aa3d2f79d" data-platform-element-id="919380649307043755-1.0.0">
	

<h2>LOADING AND DISPLAYING THE DATA</h2>
</p>
</div></div>  <p>The Online retail data can be downloaded from the UCI machine learning repository <span color="#5040ae">[5]</span>. The data sheets should be converted to <em>online1.csv</em> and <em>online2.csv</em> to facilitate loading from disk. The command <span color="#8d7824">pwd</span> or <span color="#8d7824">os.getcwd()</span> can be used to find the current directory from which PySpark will load the files. Below it can be seen that PySpark only takes a couple of seconds whereas Pandas would take a couple of minutes on the same machine.<br></p>      <p><span size="2">Duration: 4.93 seconds</span><br></p>    <p><span size="2">Duration: 1.75 seconds</span><br></p>  <p>Size of the DataFrames (or shapes in terms of Pandas) can be obtained with the following code:<br></p>    <p>To have all the data together in one DataFrame, <em>df1</em> and <em>df2</em> will be concatenated vertically.<br></p>    <p>The following displays the first 5 rows. The command <span color="#8d7824">.limit(5)</span> will be used frequently throughout the text, which is comparable to the equivalent <span color="#8d7824">.head(5)</span> in Pandas, to set the number of rows that is displayed.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f1_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>This is the traditional Spark DataFrame output.

<h2>CHANGING NAME AND DATA TYPE</h2>
</p>
</div></div>  <p>The column name <em>Customer ID</em> contains an annoying white space that under certain circumstances can cause problems. So we should better rename that.<br></p>    <p>Further, the <em>Country</em> EIRE can be replaced by Ireland. The result can be verified by <span color="#8d7824">df.filter(df.Country == "Ireland").limit(5)</span><br></p>    <p>Information about the column type can be obtained. If you want some supplementary information,<span color="#8d7824"><span color="#2a2a2a"> an alternative command is</span></span> <span color="#8d7824">df.explain(df) </span>.<br></p>    <p><span size="2">StructType(List(StructField(Invoice,StringType,true),StructField(StockCode,StringType,true),StructField(Description,StringType,true),StructField(Quantity,IntegerType,true),StructField(InvoiceDate,StringType,true),StructField(Price,DoubleType,true),StructField(CustomerID,IntegerType,true),StructField(Country,StringType,true)))</span><br></p>  <p>Knowing the column types, we could now cast the column <em>Quantity</em> from integer to float.<br></p>    <p>The <em>InvoiceDate</em> shows up as a string. In order to exploit the time-related information, it would be best to convert it to date type. We will do this by creating a new column <em>n_InvoiceDate</em>.<br></p>    <p>Sorting the new dates, we can now display the number of records (rows) as a function of date and time.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f4_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>It is also possible to display a range of dates. The following spots all sales at&nbsp;15 Jan 2010 from 8 till 10 o'clock.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f5_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>    <p>Time-serie analyses often require different units, like seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years. For example, if we would like to display the sales per week, we could use the function <span color="#8d7824">weekofyear</span> that translates the date to week.<br></p>    <p>Multiple columns can be used in a computation. The total <em>Amount</em> a customer spent can be computed by multiplication of the <em>Price</em> of a single product with its <em>Quantity</em>.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f6_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>    <p>How to select rows with specific products? We can use the command <span color="#8d7824">isin</span>, which is very similar to the Pandas isin function:<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f7_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>If we want to search our data by key word, we would use the command <span color="#8d7824">like</span>.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f8_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>To find big buyers, probably organizational customers, select rows where <em>Quantity</em> is larger than 50000. Note that <span color="#8d7824">df.where(df.Quantity &gt; 50000)</span> would give a similar result.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f9_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>Let us count the number of data records per country and sort the output, which shows that UK is clearly leading the list.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f10_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p><span color="#8d7824">Sort</span> can be used for <em>InvoiceDate</em> as well.

Using for example SQL queries, a subset of the data can be exported to CRM and KPI sales software. This offers a lot of flexibility for data analyses. Let us experiment with some very useful SQL queries, such as select and filter. We first need to register the DataFrame as a temporary table in the SQLContext. <br></p>    <p>We first select a couple of columns, for example <em>Description</em> and <em>Quantity</em>. If you want to select all columns, simply use the star: <span color="#8d7824">spark.sql("select * from df").show(5)</span><br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f12_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>Select the columns <em>Description</em> and <em>Quantity</em> and only those rows where <em>Quantity</em> has value = 6<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f13_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>Select the columns <em>Description</em>, <em>Quantity</em>, and <em>Country</em> where <em>Quantity</em> has value = 6 and <em>country</em> is United Kingdom.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f14_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>SQL can also be used to show distinct (unique) values in a column. To limit space, only five are displayed here.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f15_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>And we can count the number of distinct values, that is how many countries are in total in the data.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f16_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>Using SQL we can also exclude certain values. For example, exclude all records with United Kingdom.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f17_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>It would be possible to add a new column that categorizes UK (1) or not-UK (0). You could then use <span color="#8d7824">df.filter(df.Country == "United Kingdom").limit(5)</span> and <span color="#8d7824">filter(df.Country == "France").limit(5)</span> to check if the column is correctly coding UK versus not-UK.<br></p>    <p>Next, we could count UK versus not-UK using the new column <em>Country_UK</em>.<br></p>    <p>And compute mean <em>Amount</em> and summed <em>Quantity</em>.<br></p>      <div><p>That is it for now! In the current blog I have chosen to write out the code line by line. The code can of course be wrapped in several functions with the advantage that it can be used as a pre-processing script for different datasets, where you can set your own parameters. Further, smaller subsets of data can easily be exported and visualized in for ex. Plotly.</p><p>There are many other exciting features and developments in Spark:<br>1. Koalas is a Pandas API in Apache Spark, with similar capabilities but in a big data environment.

        <p>Side effects break referential transparency. If you have a function <code>f</code> which has a pure type but performs
side effects behind closed doors (e.g., <code>f x = unsafePerformIO ...</code>), you’d have to be careful when refactoring the
code. You may want to, for instance, avoid changing <code>f x + f x</code> into <code>let y = f x in y + y</code>.</p>

<p>But even if you never make such substitutions yourself, the compiler may decide to step in and
do it for you. This post summarizes circumstances in which GHC may perform
optimizations that could change the behavior of your program, in the presence of non-referentially transparent
functions like <code>unsafePerformIO</code>, <code>unsafeDupablePerformIO</code>, and <code>accursedUnutterablePerformIO</code>. Hopefully this
helps you understand how to safely use them if you absolutely must do so.</p>

<p>By the way, the reason the title specifically features <code>accursedUnutterablePerformIO</code> is twofold:</p>
<ol>
  <li><code>accursedUnutterablePerformIO</code> is the least safe of the three. Therefore, most if not all what
 I’m about to say that applies to <code>unsafePerformIO</code> and <code>unsafeDupablePerformIO</code> is also applicable to <code>accursedUnutterablePerformIO</code>.</li>
  <li><code>accursedUnutterablePerformIO</code> is such a priceless name and I just couldn’t help myself.</li>
</ol>



<p>Here’s some useful background before we dive into the details. Some of the things GHC can do that alter the behaviors of
side-effectful functions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Common subexpression elimination (CSE). CSE rewrites <code>f x + f x</code> into <code>let y = f x in y + y</code>, which may decrease
the number of times side effects are performed. CSE is turned on by default when compiling with <code>-O</code> and <code>-O2</code>, and can be
disabled with the <code>-fno-cse</code> flag.</li>
  <li>Full laziness optimization. The definition of full laziness is “every expression is evaluated at most once after the variables in
it have been bound”. This is achieved by floating bindings out of lambdas, for example, <code>f x = let y = g 42 in x + y</code>
is rewritten into <code>y = g 42; f x = x + y</code>. By floating <code>y = g 42</code> out of <code>f</code>, <code>g 42</code> is evaluated
at most once, which may also decrease the number of times side effects are performed. The original definition, on the other
hand, would evaluate <code>g 42</code> every time <code>f</code> is applied to an <code>x</code>. Full laziness is also turned on when compiling with <code>-O</code> and <code>-O2</code>, and can be
disabled with the <code>-fno-full-laziness</code> flag.</li>
  <li>Inlining. This has the opposite outcome with respect to side effects: inlining a side-effectful definition may cause
the side effect to be performed more times compared to not inlining it.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is worth mentioning that these three things don’t act independently, but are related and sometimes interact with one another
in ways that can be really subtle, as the examples that follow shall demonstrate.</p>

<p>About the three unsafe functions covered in this post:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>unsafePerformIO</code> is the most well-known, and is relatively the safest, but the slowest of the three.</li>
  <li><code>unsafeDupablePerformIO</code> is faster but also less safe, in the sense that it provides
no guarantee that an <code>IO</code> action won’t be performed simultaneously by multiple threads.</li>
  <li><code>accursedUnutterablePerformIO</code> (from the <code>bytestring</code> package) is even faster but much less safe. Not
only does it not check for duplicates, but it inlines everything, which makes CSE a lot more likely to
be triggered. It used to be called <code>inlinePerformIO</code>, but <code>accursedUnutterablePerformIO</code> is an undeniably more
advisable name.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the following examples assume GHC 8.10.1 and <code>-O2</code>.</p>



<p>Let’s start with something simple:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Main</span> <span>where</span>
<span>import</span> <span>System.IO.Unsafe</span>

<span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>unsafePerformIO</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>putStrLn</span> <span>"side effect!"</span>
  <span>pure</span> <span>x</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>print</span> <span>(</span><span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>0</span> <span>+</span> <span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>hasSideEffect 0</code> is obviously a common subexpression in the body of <code>main</code>. It would be factored out if CSE
is turned on, meaning “side effect!” would only be printed once. Passing <code>-fno-cse</code> to GHC makes it print twice.</p>

<p>Note that it doesn’t matter if <code>hasSideEffect</code> is inlined or not. <code>hasSideEffect 0</code> is a common subexpression
in either case.</p>



<p>The following example demonstrates the effect of the full laziness optimization:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Main</span> <span>where</span>
<span>import</span> <span>System.IO.Unsafe</span>

<span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>unsafePerformIO</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>putStrLn</span> <span>"side effect!"</span>
  <span>pure</span> <span>x</span>

<span>f</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>f</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>g</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>let</span> <span>n</span> <span>=</span> <span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>x</span>
             <span>in</span> <span>if</span> <span>y</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>then</span> <span>0</span> <span>else</span> <span>g</span> <span>(</span><span>y</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>n</span>
   <span>in</span> <span>g</span> <span>5</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>print</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The full laziness optimization causes “side effect!” to be only printed once. Although the value of
<code>n = hasSideEffect x</code> is used five times when evaluating <code>g 5</code>, <code>n</code> is only evaluated once, because
it is floated out of the body of <code>g</code>. If we disable full-laziness by passing <code>-fno-full-laziness</code>, you’d
see “side effect!” printed five times.</p>

<p>In this example there’s no common subexpression to eliminate, so disabling CSE has no effect.</p>



<p>Inlining, on the contrary, can increase the number of times a side effect is performed.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Main</span> <span>where</span>
<span>import</span> <span>System.IO.Unsafe</span>

<span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>=</span> <span>unsafePerformIO</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>putStrLn</span> <span>"side effect!"</span>

<p>This program prints “side effect!” once, which is usually what you want for having a constant value defined using <code>unsafePerformIO</code>.
Turning off CSE and/or full laziness does not change the behavior. If you change <code>{-# NOINLINE hasSideEffect #-}</code> to
<code>{-# INLINE hasSideEffect #-}</code>, then “side effect!” would be printed twice: once when evaluating <code>x</code> and once for <code>y</code>.</p>

<p>When there is neither an <code>INLINE</code> nor a <code>NOINLINE</code> pragma, GHC doesn’t seem to like inlining constants. It is, however, free
to do so. For constants that contain side effects, such as <code>hasSideEffect</code>, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> in the above example, it is
therefore almost always advisable to apply the <code>NOINLINE</code> pragma. In fact, HLint warns
against missing <code>NOINLINE</code> pragmas for constants defined using <code>unsafePerformIO</code>s. This advice, of course, isn’t
applicable to functions with <code>unsafePerformIO</code>s in their bodies. For a function like <code>f x = unsafePerformIO (... x ...)</code>, the
side effect needs to be performed whenever <code>f</code> is applied to an <code>x</code>, so it may as well be inlined.</p>



<p>Consider this program.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Main</span> <span>where</span>
<span>import</span> <span>System.IO.Unsafe</span>

<span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>unsafePerformIO</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>putStrLn</span> <span>"side effect!"</span>
  <span>pure</span> <span>x</span>

<span>f</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>f</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>g</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>let</span> <span>z</span> <span>=</span> <span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>y</span> <span>+</span> <span>z</span>
      <span>{-# INLINE g #-}</span>
   <span>in</span> <span>g</span> <span>0</span> <span>+</span> <span>g</span> <span>1</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>print</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This program prints “side effect!” just once, whether <code>g</code> is inlined or not inlined. In order to make “side effect!”
print twice, you need to disable CSE if <code>g</code> is inlined, but disable
full laziness if <code>g</code> is not inlined. Let’s study why this is the case.</p>

<p>If <code>g</code> is inlined, <code>g 0 + g 1</code> becomes</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>z</span> <span>=</span> <span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>0</span> <span>+</span> <span>z</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>z</span> <span>=</span> <span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>z</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>hasSideEffect x</code> is a common subexpression, so it is factored out by CSE, causing “side effect!” to be printed
just once. In this case the inlining happened in a simplifier pass before the full laziness pass (which can be
observed from the output of <code>-dshow-passes</code>), and therefore, the full laziness pass didn’t have the opportunity
to float <code>z = hasSideEffect x</code> out of <code>g</code> before <code>g</code> was inlined. This is why turning off
full laziness has no effect, but turning off CSE does.</p>

<p>If <code>g</code> is not inlined, on the other hand, there would be no common subexpression to eliminate.
Instead, the full laziness pass would float <code>z = hasSideEffect x</code> out of <code>g</code>. This is why turning off
CSE has no effect, but turning off full laziness does.</p>

<p>It is also possible to make it so that <em>both</em> <code>-fno-cse</code> and <code>-fno-full-laziness</code> are needed in order for
“side effect!” to be printed twice. For example, try <code>{-# NOINLINE [2] g #-}</code>. This is because</p>
<ul>
  <li>If full-laziness is turned on, <code>z = hasSideEffect x</code> would be floated out of <code>g</code> <em>before</em> inlining (because we told
GHC to avoid inlining until after phase 2, which comes after the full laziness pass). After <code>z = hasSideEffect x</code>
is floated out, it would <em>not</em> subsequently be inlined, and therefore “side effect!” is only printed once.</li>
  <li>If CSE is turned on, it would happen <em>after</em> inlining. Since inlining enables CSE to “see” the common
subexpression <code>hasSideEffect x</code>, it is factored out, and therefore “side effect!” is only printed once.</li>
</ul>

<p>Simply put, in this case inlining happens after the full-laziness pass but before the CSE pass, and this means
you need to turn them both off for the side effect to be performed twice.</p>

<p>This example shows that the interaction between CSE, full-laziness and inlining can be subtle. If your
program uses <code>unsafePerformIO</code> or similar unsafe functions, the simplest way to ensure that the behavior is easily predictable
is to either <code>NOINLINE</code> everything and turn off both CSE and full-laziness, or compile the program with <code>-O0</code>.
You don’t really want to do either of them because they both kill performance, so it really pays to understand the nuances so that you lose as little performance as possible while ensuring the program behaves as expected.</p>



<p>Using <code>unsafeDupablePerformIO</code> instead of <code>unsafePerformIO</code> is another way to potentially make an IO action
perform more times than intended. This is slightly off topic since it is about concurrency rather than GHC modifying
your program, but since <code>unsafeDupablePerformIO</code> falls in between the relatively safe <code>unsafePerformIO</code> and the
extremely unsafe <code>accursedUnutterablePerformIO</code>, I reckon it is worth mentioning.</p>

<p>A thunk is usually evaluated only once. When a thread attempts to force a thunk, and that thunk is already being
evaluated by another thread, the first thread would usually block rather than evaluating the thunk again. This is
achieved using a technique called <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2005/09/2005-haskell.pdf">blackholing</a>.
Blackholing is by default lazy, but an eager option is possible via flag <code>-feager-blackholing</code>, which guarantees
that no thunk is evaluated more than once (with a slight performance penalty).</p>

<p>If a thunk is built using <code>unsafePerformIO</code>, then even if the thunk is evaluated by more than one thread
in parallel, the IO …</p></div></div>

GPT-3 is a natural language model that, given some examples, tries to predict appropriate text output for a given text input. Since code is just text, there's the question of whether it can be used to produce code based only on a description of what the code should do. And, amazing world that we live in, there are already some early<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 49 --> <!-- /react-text --><a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457" data-reactid="50">tech demos</a><!-- react-text: 51 --> <!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 52 -->of exactly that.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="54">A common off-the-cuff reaction to such demos is that this sort of technology will inevitably make Software Engineers obsolete, because if an AI can produce more or less what they produce, then seemingly we won't need to pay them to do it anymore.</p><p data-reactid="55">The reasoning for these kinds of claims is understandable. If your premise is that a Software Engineer's job is to take a description of what some software should do, and write code to implement that, then it makes sense to view technology like this as a drop-in replacement.</p><p data-reactid="56">But that's not right. What a Software Engineer really does is build software solutions to solve problems appropriately. That seems like a subtle distinction, but it's a really important one. Code is not the solution, it's the implementation of a solution. The solution certainly requires that code be written, hence the ability to write code. But going the other direction, the ability to write code does not imply the ability to create appropriate solutions to problems.</p><p data-reactid="57">I think because writing code is intrinsically a difficult skill which is opaque and unfamiliar to outsiders, it appears like the hard part of building software is in fact writing code. But it really isn't, and that's the point. The hard part is solving the problem appropriately. Implementing that solution in code once you have it is comparatively easy.</p><p data-reactid="58">This is counter-intuitive, and I don't think it's something that can be fully appreciated without having gone through the process of building software yourself. Without this insight, it does indeed seem like an AI writing code opens up the possibility of generalists building software, just by describing their ideas. But that's no more true than saying that hiring a skilled ghost writer opens up the possibility for anybody with a story idea to write a great novel.</p><p data-reactid="60">So, I understand the basis of these claims from an outsider's perspective. They are reasonable given the premises they're based on. What does surprise me a bit, though, is the common rebuttals that seem to come up from insiders - Software Engineers themselves.</p><p data-reactid="61">There are two main forms. The first is "this will never work": pointing out all the technical difficulties of such a thing in practice. The other is "it's all just code anyway": the notion that the natural language description of any software past a certain point of complexity would have to be structured and formalised to the extent that it basically becomes code.</p><p data-reactid="62"><!-- react-text: 63 -->I find these rebuttals surprising not because they're necessarily wrong. They're actually very practical - the thing has to basically work before the rest of the conversation is relevant, after all, and we're still a very long way from that. I find them surprising more just because they meet the claims at their own level, seeming to implicitly accept their premise. They say "this is wrong because AI won't be able to meaningfully write code" rather than "this is wrong because when AI<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 64 --> <!-- /react-text --><span data-reactid="65">can</span><!-- react-text: 66 --> meaningfully write code, far from making Software Engineers obsolete, it will help them".<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="67">The reason I'd expect more Software Engineers to hold the latter view is because there's really nothing new here. I guess using AI to produce code looks like some giant leap at first glance, but it's really more a linear progression of something that's been happening in the software industry since day one - using software to automate writing software. Tools and frameworks that improve efficiency in building software by automating more and more of the heavy lifting are something that every Software Engineer is familiar with, and it's understood that they're unequivocally a good thing. Why should an AI writing code be any different?</p><p data-reactid="68">Furthermore, it's established at this point that such tools do not lead to less need for Software Engineers, because there is not a fixed limit of demand for software to be built. Rather, they allow more and better software to be built faster, opening new opportunities to apply software solutions where they weren't previously economical, growing the software industry and actually increasing the value of the skillset needed to build software, which again, is not the same thing as the ability to write code.</p><p data-reactid="70">Software Engineers should welcome every advancement that brings forward AI tools that assist in writing larger and more meaningful parts of our code. This isn't something to resist, but something to push forward, because far from making Software Engineers obsolete, these tools will further leverage the skills they have that are most valuable.</p><p data-reactid="71">And come on, who likes typing anyway?</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of the most harmful behaviors I’ve observed in ineffective leadership is a tendency to add chaos when one enters a room. Chaos comes in many flavors: A decision was reached about an important architecture question weeks ago, but someone suddenly insists that you revisit the project’s fundamental goals at the 11th hour. An executive insists that their project is most important, and pushes it onto the roadmap. Or maybe you leave a productive meeting without concrete next steps, and are right back where you started in a week.</p>

<h3 id="great-leaders-vacuum-up-chaos">Great leaders vacuum up chaos</h3>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/chaos/tasmanian-devil.jpg" alt="Tasmanian devil going crazy">
Nobody is excited when this guy enters the room</p>

<p>My litmus test for effective leadership: any room that you enter should have more certainty and a firmer plan by the time that you leave it. Good leaders can walk into a situation where people have lost track of their goals and get everyone aligned on a clear path forward. They remove unimportant details, distill complex situations to their essence, and get the right decision-maker to make a call – even if it’s not them. They’re able to not only stop bad plans before it’s too late, but get them moving again in the right direction.</p>

<p>Usually, chaos-causing behavior is unintentional and comes from a good place. Often people are just missing context, or haven’t developed a rhythm for making sure that projects and plans stay organized. In rare cases, it can arise for less savory reasons: someone wants to flex on others by diverting a conversation to a favorite topic or forcing a change of plans.</p>

<h3 id="be-a-source-of-stability">Be a source of stability</h3>

<p>I’ve been guilty of causing my share of unnecessary chaos, and have always regretted it. However, I was fortunate enough to also have a number of teammates who weren’t shy about calling me out for this over the years. I’ve since built a grab bag of practices on how to be better:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Strive for measurable outcomes, and frequently reinforce the goals of what you’re working on even if it’s repetitive. For example, if you’re trying to increase conversions from your login page, be clear about why this is important and how you’ll measure success.</li>
  <li><a href="https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/05/05/Running-Meetings.html">Insist that all meetings have agendas</a>. Don’t overthink this – a single bullet like “decide what color to make the login button” is fine. A shocking proportion of seemingly simple meetings will wander without this, and it only takes 30 seconds. Don’t let people waste your time, or their own.</li>
  <li>Confirm in-person decisions that were complicated, non-intuitive, or contentious in writing: “We decided the login button should be neon pink so that it really stands out from the blue page background.”</li>
  <li>Use documents for complex decisions. It’s easier to catch when a document is off-track, because unlike a conversation you can see the entire arc of the discussion at once. The decision to make the login button pink should live in a document or ticket.</li>
  <li>When in doubt, over-communicate. Say what you’re planning to do next, so that work doesn’t get duplicated: “I’m going to add this decision on the login button to our design document.” If you’re not going to do something, confirm that as well: “I’m not going to update our design mockups, so if anyone thinks that we’ll need that, speak up now.”</li>
  <li>Avoid using power or appeals to authority to sidestep teams’ processes for prioritization. This is important for teams that you manage, and especially important when working with other teams. <a href="https://staysaasy.com/process/2020/04/06/Creating-Good-Process.html">Good lightweight processes</a> are one of the best ways to add efficiency to a team, and breaking them is akin to removing the oil from your car. If you must break processes, make sure to explain why.</li>
  <li>If a plan seems strange, ask questions to understand “why” before asking anyone to change the course of action. If you think that you’re going to need to ask someone to change plans, try to ask at least one extra clarifying question or wait 5 minutes longer in the conversation before reacting.</li>
</ul>

<p>And most importantly: <em>The fancier your title, the more you must avoid causing chaos</em>. If Bob the Intern frantically flip-flops on the plan for his summer project, people will patiently help him towards a good path and perhaps make sure he has less caffeine tomorrow. If Bob the CEO flip-flops on his strategy, people will capsize the ship trying to enact his will. Remove chaos and you and your team will be happier and more successful.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/grafana/all%20together%20now_wide.jpg" alt="Grafana, InfluxDB and CollectD"></p><h4 id="for-some-companies-infrastructure-is-the-heart-of-its-business-specifically-i-am-referring-to-those-companies-which-need-to-manage-data-and-applications-located-on-more-than-one-server">For some companies, infrastructure is the heart of its business. Specifically, I am referring to those companies which need to manage data and applications located on more than one server.</h4><p>It is essential for a company to monitor its infrastructure nodes, especially if the company does not have on-site access to intervene when issues arise. In fact, the intensive use of some resources can be an indication of malfunctioning or overcrowding. However, in addition to prevention, monitoring could be used to assess possible implications of new software in the production environment. Currently, there are several “ready-to-use” solutions on the market to keep track of all the resources consumed. These solutions, which appear reasonable, present two key problems: the high price of setup and security issues related to third parties.</p><p>The first problem is related to cost. Prices vary from 10 euros per month up to thousands depending on how many hosts you need to monitor — with the former being consumer pricing and the latter being enterprise pricing. So, for example, let’s imagine that I have three nodes to monitor during the course of a year. At 10 euros per month, I would spend 120 euros. For smaller enterprises, where the price can range between 10,000 and 20,000 euro per year, such an expense can bloat its underlying cost structure and become financially untenable.</p><p>The second problem is third party risk. Typically, infrastructure data must pass through a third party company in order to be seen and analysed for the customer — whether that be an individual consumer or an enterprise. How does the third party company capture the data and then present it to the customer? Simply put, the third party company often collects data through a custom agent that is installed onto a node and monitored. Quite often is it found that this installation is not up-to-date and compatible with operating systems. Previous work has been done by security researchers who cast light upon problems with <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/linux/misc/nagios_nrpe_arguments">“proprietary collectors”</a>. Would you trust them? I would not.</p><p>In keeping nodes for both <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TorRelayGuide">Tor</a> and some <a href="https://getmonero.org/">cryptocurrencies</a>, I prefer to opt for a cost free, easy to configure, and open-source alternative. Here, we will use the triad: Grafana, InfluxDB, and CollectD.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/grafana/grafana-graphs.png" alt="An example of a Grafana dashboard"></p><h2 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h2><p>In order to be able to analyse every metric of our infrastructure, it is necessary to use a program capable of capturing statistics on the machines we want to monitor. In this regard, <a href="https://collectd.org/">CollectD</a> comes to your aid: it is a daemon that groups and collects (hence the name) all the parameters that can be stored on disk or sent over the network.</p><p>The data will be transmitted to an instance of <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/">InfluxDB</a>: a particular time series database that associates to each data the time (coded in UNIX timestamp) in which the server received it. In this way, the data sent by CollectD will already be set in a temporal way, as a succession of events.</p><p>Finally, you will use <a href="http://grafana.org/">Grafana</a> which will connect to InfluxDB to create flashy dashboards to display the data in a user-friendly way. Through histograms and graphs of every kind, it will be possible to observe in real time all the data related to CPU, RAM, etc.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/grafana/grafana-diagram.png" alt="Grafana infrastructure"></p><h2 id="influxdb">InfluxDB</h2><picture>
<source media="(min-width: 535px)" data-original-set="/images/grafana/db_alone.jpg 1x,

InfluxDB is a time series database <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb">open-source</a> developed in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> to store data as a sequence of events.</p><p>Each time data is added, it is linked to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">a UNIX timestamp</a> by default. This allows enormous flexibility for the user who no longer has to worry about saving, as an example, the “time” variable, which is sometimes cumbersome to configure. Let’s imagine we have several machines located in a number of continents. How do we manage the “time” variable? Do we use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time">Greenwich</a> meridian for all the data? Or do we set a different time zone for each node? If data is saved on different time zones, how can we accurately display the graphs? As you can see, this can be very complicated.</p><p>As a time-aware database that automatically timestamps any data point, InfluxDB has the advantage of simultaneously being able to write to a certain database. This is why we often imagine InfluxDB as a timeline. Writing data does not affect the performance of the database (as sometimes happens in MySQL), since writing is simply the addition of a certain event to the timeline. The name of the program derives precisely from the conception of time as an infinite and indefinite “flow” that flows.</p><h3 id="installation-and-configuration">Installation and configuration</h3><p>Another advantage of InflxuDB is the <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/introduction/install/">ease of installation</a> and the extensive <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/">documentation</a> provided by the community that widely supports the project. It has two types of interfaces: via <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/tools/shell/">Command Line</a> (which is powerful and flexible for developers, but poorly prepared to see large amounts of data) and an <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/guides/write_data/#sidebar">HTTP API</a> that allows direct communication with the database.</p><p>InfluxDB can be downloaded not only from the official website, but also from the package manager of the distribution (in this example we use a Debian system). It is advisable to check the package via GPG before installation, so (below) we import the keys of the InfluxDB package:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><a href="https://serhack.me/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="c9bba6a6bd89a7a6adac">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>#~: curl -sL https://repos.influxdata.com/influxdb.key | sudo apt-key add -

InfluxDB uses a particular query language called <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/query_language/">“InfluxQL”</a>, similar to SQL, which allows you to interact with the database. To create a new entry, we use the query <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/administration/authentication_and_authorization/#user-management-commands"><code>CREATE USER</code></a>.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><a href="https://serhack.me/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="e89a87879ca886878c8d">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>#~: influx

By default, CollectD captures metrics on CPU, RAM, memory (on disk), network interfaces, processes, etc. The potential of the program is endless, given that it can be extended with a preinstalled <a href="https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Table_of_Plugins">plugin enablement</a> or through the <a href="https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Roadmap#Wishlist_.2F_Ideas">creation of new ones</a>.</p><p>As you can see, installing CollectD is simple:</p><p>In a simplistic manner, let’s illustrate how CollectD works. Suppose that I want to check how many processes my node has. In doing so, CollectD does nothing more than make an API call to get the number of processes per time unit (defined as 5000 ms, by default). Once captured, the data will be sent to InfluxDB via a module (called “Network”) to be configured.</p><p>Open the file <code>/etc/collectd.conf</code> with our editor, scroll to find the <code>Network</code> section, and edit as written in the following snippet. Be sure to specify the IP where the interface of InfluxDB (<code>INFLUXDB_IP</code>) is located.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><a href="https://serhack.me/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="daa8b5b5ae9ab4b5bebf">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>#~: nano /etc/collectd.conf

&lt;/Plugin&gt;
    ...</code></pre></div><p>My suggestion is to modify, within the configuration, the hostname that is sent to InfluxDB (which in our infrastructure is a “centralized” database, since it resides on a single node). In doing so, the data will not be redundant and there is no risk that other nodes will overwrite the information.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/grafana/tres_caballeros.jpg" alt="Three daemon"></p><h2 id="grafana">Grafana</h2><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/grafana/grafana_alone.jpg" alt=""></p><blockquote><p>A graph is worth thousand of images</p></blockquote><p>In remembrance of this famous “quote”, observing the infrastructure metrics live through graphs and tables enables us to act in an efficient and timely manner. To create and configure the dashboard, we will use Grafana.</p><p>Grafana is an open-source tool, compatible with a wide range of databases (including InfluxDB), that presents a graphical representation of metrics and allows a user to create alerts if a particular piece of data meets a condition. For example, if your CPU reaches high peaks, you can be notified on Slack, Mattermost, by email, etc. In fact, I have personally configured an alert every time someone enters SSH, so I can actively monitor who “enters” my infrastructure.</p><p>Grafana does not require any special settings: once again, it is InfluxDB that “scans” the “time” variable. The integration is simple.

<p>Either you’ve already heard of <code>pandoc</code> or if you have searched online for <code>markdown</code> to <code>pdf</code> or similar, you are sure to come across <code>pandoc</code>. This tutorial will help you use <code>pandoc</code> to generate <code>pdf</code> and <code>epub</code> from a <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">GitHub style markdown</a> file. The main motivation for this blog post is to highlight what customizations I did to generate <code>pdf</code> and <code>epub</code> versions for <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/books/">self-publishing my ebooks</a>. It wasn’t easy to arrive at the set-up I ended up with, so I hope this will be useful for those looking to use <code>pandoc</code> to generate <code>pdf</code> and <code>epub</code> formats. This guide is specifically aimed at technical books that has code snippets.</p>



<h2 id="installation"><a name="installation"></a>Installation</h2>

<p>I use Ubuntu, as far as I remember, the below steps are enough to work for the demos in this tutorial. If you get an error or warning, search that issue online and you’ll likely find what else has to be installed.</p>

<p>I first downloaded <code>deb</code> file from <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases">pandoc: releases</a> and installed it. Followed by packages needed for <code>pdf</code> generation.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span># latest pandoc version as of 21 July 2010 is 2.10</span>
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>gdebi ~/Downloads/pandoc-2.10-1-amd64.deb

<span>$ </span><span># note that download size is 750+ MB</span>
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>texlive-xetex
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>librsvg2-bin
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>texlive-math-extra
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For more details and guide for other OS, refer to <a href="https://pandoc.org/installing.html">pandoc: installation</a></p>



<h2 id="minimal-example"><a name="minimal-example"></a>Minimal example</h2>

<p>Once <code>pandoc</code> is working on your system, try generating a sample <code>pdf</code> without any customization.</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/info.svg" alt="info"> See <a href="https://github.com/learnbyexample/learnbyexample.github.io/tree/master/files/pandoc_pdf">learnbyexample.github.io repo</a> for all the input and output files referred in this tutorial.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>pandoc sample_1.md <span>-f</span> gfm <span>-o</span> sample_1.pdf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here <code>sample_1.md</code> is input markdown file and <code>-f</code> is used to specify that the input format is GitHub style markdown. The <code>-o</code> option specifies the output file type based on extension. The default output is probably good enough. But I wished to customize hyperlinks, inline code style, add page breaks between chapters, etc. This blog post will discuss these customizations one by one.</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/info.svg" alt="info"> <code>pandoc</code> has its own flavor of <code>markdown</code> with many useful extensions — see <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown">pandoc: pandocs-markdown</a> for details. GitHub style markdown is recommended if you wish to use the same source (or with minor changes) in multiple places.</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/info.svg" alt="info"> It is advised to use <code>markdown</code> headers in order without skipping — for example, <code>H1</code> for chapter heading and <code>H2</code> for chapter sub-section, etc is fine. <code>H1</code> for chapter heading and <code>H3</code> for sub-section is not. Using the former can give automatic index navigation on ebook readers.</p>

<p>On <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince">Evince</a> reader, the index navigation for above sample looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/pandoc_pdf/chapter_index.png" alt="Chapter Index"></p>



<h2 id="chapter-breaks"><a name="chapter-breaks"></a>Chapter breaks</h2>

<p>As observed from previous demo, by default there are no chapter breaks. Searching for a <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/601469/getting-chapters-to-start-on-a-new-page-in-a-pandoc-generated-pdf">solution online</a>, I got this piece of <code>tex</code> code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>\usepackage</span><span>{</span>sectsty<span>}</span>
<span>\sectionfont</span><span>{</span><span>\clearpage</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This can be added using <code>-H</code> option. From <code>pandoc</code> manual,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>-H FILE, –include-in-header=FILE</p>

  <p>Include  contents  of FILE, verbatim, at the end of the header.  This
can be used, for example, to include special  CSS  or  JavaScript  in
HTML documents.  This option can be used repeatedly to include multiple
files in the header.  They will be included in the  order  specified.
Implies –standalone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>pandoc</code> invocation now looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>pandoc sample_1.md <span>-f</span> gfm <span>-H</span> chapter_break.tex <span>-o</span> sample_1_chapter_break.pdf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can add further customization to headings, for example use <code>\sectionfont{\underline\clearpage}</code> to underline chapter names or <code>\sectionfont{\LARGE\clearpage}</code> to allow chapter names to get even bigger. Here’s some more links to read about various customizations:</p>

<ul>

</ul>



<h2 id="changing-settings-via--v-option"><a name="changing-settings-via--v-option"></a>Changing settings via -V option</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>-V KEY[=VAL], –variable=KEY[:VAL]</p>

  <p>Set the template variable KEY to the value  VAL  when  rendering  the
document  in standalone mode.  This is generally only useful when the
–template option is used to specify a custom template, since  pandoc
automatically  sets  the variables used in the default templates.  If
no VAL is specified, the key will be given the value true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>-V</code> option allows to change variable values to customize settings like page size, font, link color, etc. As more settings are changed, better to use a simple script to call <code>pandoc</code> instead of typing the whole command on terminal.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

pandoc <span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-f</span> gfm <span>\</span>
    <span>--include-in-header</span> chapter_break.tex <span>\</span>
    <span>-V</span> linkcolor:blue <span>\</span>
    <span>-V</span> geometry:a4paper <span>\</span>
    <span>-V</span> geometry:margin<span>=</span>2cm <span>\</span>
    <span>-V</span> <span>mainfont</span><span>=</span><span>"DejaVu Serif"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-V</span> <span>monofont</span><span>=</span><span>"DejaVu Sans Mono"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--pdf-engine</span><span>=</span>xelatex <span>\</span>
    <span>-o</span> <span>"</span><span>$2</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>mainfont</code> is for normal text</li>
  <li><code>monofont</code> is for code snippets</li>
  <li><code>geometry</code> for page size and margins</li>
  <li><code>linkcolor</code> to set hyperlink color</li>
  <li>to increase default <strong>font size</strong>, use <code>-V fontsize=12pt</code>
    <ul>
      <li>See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23811002/from-markdown-to-pdf-how-to-change-the-font-size-with-pandoc">stackoverflow: change font size</a> if you need even bigger size options</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Using <code>xelatex</code> as the <code>pdf-engine</code> allows to use any font installed in the system. One reason I chose <code>DejaVu</code> was because it supported <strong>Greek</strong> and other Unicode characters that were causing error with other fonts. See <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/21736/using-xelatex-instead-of-pdflatex">tex.stackexchange: Using XeLaTeX instead of pdfLaTeX</a> for some more details.</p>

<p>The <code>pandoc</code> invocation is now through a script:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>chmod</span> +x md2pdf.sh
<span>$ </span>./md2pdf.sh sample_1.md sample_1_settings.pdf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Do compare the pdf generated side by side with previous output before proceeding.</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/warning.svg" alt="warning"> On my system, <code>DejaVu Serif</code> did not have <em>italic</em> variation installed, so I had to use <code>sudo apt install ttf-dejavu-extra</code> to get it.</p>



<h2 id="syntax-highlighting"><a name="syntax-highlighting"></a>Syntax highlighting</h2>

<p>One option to customize syntax highlighting for code snippets is to save one of the <code>pandoc</code> themes and editing it. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30880200/pandoc-what-are-the-available-syntax-highlighters/47876166#47876166">stackoverflow: What are the available syntax highlighters?</a> for available themes and more details (as a good practice on stackoverflow, go through all answers and comments — the linked/related sections on sidebar are useful as well).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>pandoc <span>--print-highlight-style</span><span>=</span>pygments <span>&gt;</span> pygments.theme
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Edit the above file to customize the theme. Use sites like <a href="https://www.colorhexa.com/">colorhexa</a> to help with color choices, hex values, etc. For this demo, the below settings are changed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code># by default, background is same as normal text
# change it to a shade of gray to easily distinguish code and text
"background-color": "#f8f8f8",

# change italic to false, messes up comments with slashes
# change comment text-color to yet another shade of gray
"Comment": {
    "text-color": "#9c9c9c",
    "background-color": null,
    "bold": false,
    "italic": false,
    "underline": false
},
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Inline code</strong></p>

<p>Similar to changing background color for code snippets, I found a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40975004/pandoc-latex-change-backtick-highlight">solution online</a> to change background color for inline code snippets.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>\usepackage</span><span>{</span>fancyvrb,newverbs,xcolor<span>}</span>

<span>\definecolor</span><span>{</span>Light<span>}{</span>HTML<span>}{</span>F4F4F4<span>}</span>

<span>\let\oldtexttt\texttt</span>
<span>\renewcommand</span><span>{</span><span>\texttt</span><span>}</span>[1]<span>{</span>
  <span>\colorbox</span><span>{</span>Light<span>}{</span><span>\oldtexttt</span><span>{</span>#1<span>}}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Add <code>--highlight-style pygments.theme</code> and <code>--include-in-header inline_code.tex</code> to the script and generate the <code>pdf</code> again.</p>

<p>With <code>pandoc sample_2.md -f gfm -o sample_2.pdf</code> the output would be:</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/pandoc_pdf/default_syn.png" alt="Default syntax highlighting"></p>

<p>With <code>./md2pdf_syn.sh sample_2.md sample_2_syn.pdf</code> the output is:</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/pandoc_pdf/customized_syn.png" alt="Customized syntax highlighting"></p>



<p>For my <a href="https://github.com/learnbyexample/py_regular_expressions">Python re(gex)?</a> book, by chance I found that using <code>ruby</code> instead of <code>python</code> for REPL code snippets syntax highlighting was better. Snapshot from <code>./md2pdf_syn.sh sample_3.md sample_3.pdf</code> result is shown below. For <code>python</code> directive, string output gets treated as a comment and color for boolean values isn’t easy to distinguish from string values. The <code>ruby</code> directive treats string value as expected and boolean values are easier to spot.</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/pandoc_pdf/python_vs_ruby_syn.png" alt="REPL syntax highlighting"></p>



<h2 id="bullet-styling"><a name="bullet-styling"></a>Bullet styling</h2>

<p>This <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22156999/how-to-change-the-style-of-bullets-in-pandoc-markdown">stackoverflow Q&amp;A</a> helped for bullet styling.</p>

<h2 id="adding-table-of-contents"><a name="adding-table-of-contents"></a>Adding table of contents</h2>

<p>There’s a handy option <code>--toc</code> to automatically include table of contents at top of the generated <code>pdf</code>. You can control number of levels using <code>--toc-depth</code> option, the default is 3 levels. You can also change the default string <code>Contents</code> to something else using <code>-V toc-title</code> option.</p>

<p><code>./md2pdf_syn_bullet_prop_toc.sh sample_1.md sample_1_toc.pdf</code> gives:</p>

<h2 id="adding-cover-image"><a name="adding-cover-image"></a>Adding cover image</h2>

<p>To add something prior to table of contents, cover image for example, you can use a <code>tex</code> file and include it verbatim. Create a <code>tex</code> file (named as <code>cover.tex</code> here) with content as shown below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>\includegraphics</span><span>{</span>cover.png<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, modify the previous script <code>md2pdf_syn_bullet_prop_toc.sh</code> by adding <code>--include-before-body cover.tex</code> and tada — you get the cover image before table of contents. <code>\thispagestyle{empty}</code> helps to avoid page number on the cover page, see also <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/360739/what-is-the-use-of-clearpage-thispagestyleempty-cleardoublepage">tex.stackexchange: clear page</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>bash</code> script invocation is now <code>./md2pdf_syn_bullet_prop_toc_cover.sh sample_5.md sample_5.pdf</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/warning.svg" alt="warning"> You’ll need at least one image in input markdown file, otherwise settings won’t apply to the cover image and you may end up with weird output. <code>sample_5.md</code> used in the command above includes an image. And be careful to use escapes if the image path can contain <code>tex</code> metacharacters.</p>



<h2 id="stylish-blockquote"><a name="stylish-blockquote"></a>Stylish blockquote</h2>

<p>By default, blockquotes (lines starting with <code>&gt;</code> in markdown) are just indented in the <code>pdf</code> output.

    <p>Mailinator started 17 years ago as a weekend project to define the idea of “Free, Disposable, Email”. Back then, it ran on a single server with only a single developer. Over time, it’s popularity has exploded in terms of both incoming email and active users. As you might guess when you go from thousands of emails-per-day to <strong>thousands of emails-per-second</strong>, the behind-the-scenes technical stack needs to evolve - and Mailinator’s stack has had a quite a technical journey.</p>
<p><img src="https://manybrain.github.io/m8r_blog/img/2020/07/image1.png" alt="Slide showing beginning and end tech evolution for Mailinator.com"></p>
<p>Today Mailinator still provides free, disposable, email - but also serves thousands of daily corporate users in testing their Email and SMS Workflows with an API, Webhooks, and Private Domains. Website owners quickly realized that having an infinite number of inboxes “on tap” was incredibly useful for testing things their like their Signup system, Marketing email systems, and more. Quality Assurance teams found it to be an invaluable tool.</p>
<p>In February 2020, Mailinator’s creator Paul Tyma gave a talk on the “Technical Evolution of Mailinator.com”. Below you can find a link to the slides and watch the video. The talk explores the site’s journey from a “Free, Disposable, Email” to a becoming SaaS service helping thousands of companies test their Email and SMS Workflows (and of course, scaling a system to tens of millions of emails per day).</p>

July 21, 2020 | https://blog.palabra.io/how-to-send-a-confirmation-email-when-someone-submits-a-webflow-form?ref=hackernews | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.palabra.io/how-to-send-a-confirmation-email-when-someone-submits-a-webflow-form?ref=hackernews">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>If you have a landing page or website created in Webflow, chances are you added some sort of contact form to reach interested users or prospects. Nothing gives your site more validation than people leaving their contact information, so you'll probably want to use that to make the most out of your site's traffic.</p><p>In this short article we'll show you how to send automated <strong>emails when someone submits a Webflow form</strong> using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.palabra.io/">Palabra</a>.</p><p>But why send just one email? We'll show you how to set up an entire automated sequence to welcome and engage your prospects using a no-code tool in just 5 minutes.</p><p><em>Note: Pretty obvious, but you need to have an existing Webflow site including a form to use this guide. You can learn how to do that <a href="https://university.webflow.com/article/intro-to-forms">here</a>.</em></p><h3>Step 1: Create an email trigger from a Webflow form</h3><p>To start, create a trigger and add a condition. Select "User submitted a form on Webflow" to set up the integration.</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="1.png" title="1.png" src="https://blog.palabra.io/static/dda0a44008c569addd2daa6c9ee571dd/7d769/1.png" srcset="https://blog.palabra.io/static/dda0a44008c569addd2daa6c9ee571dd/5243c/1.png 240w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/dda0a44008c569addd2daa6c9ee571dd/ab158/1.png 480w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/dda0a44008c569addd2daa6c9ee571dd/7d769/1.png 960w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/dda0a44008c569addd2daa6c9ee571dd/b43a1/1.png 1092w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><h3>Step 2: Connect your Webflow site to Palabra</h3><p>After you select the trigger, click on the card and give Palabra access to your Webflow website. Then pick from the list the website where you have the form you want to connect:</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="2.png" title="2.png" src="https://blog.palabra.io/static/be36ec5cf8f8f440f7258b253580a23a/7d769/2.png" srcset="https://blog.palabra.io/static/be36ec5cf8f8f440f7258b253580a23a/5243c/2.png 240w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/be36ec5cf8f8f440f7258b253580a23a/ab158/2.png 480w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/be36ec5cf8f8f440f7258b253580a23a/7d769/2.png 960w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/be36ec5cf8f8f440f7258b253580a23a/2b72d/2.png 980w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>You'll need your Webflow form to include an email input to trigger the sequence. If you don't have one, just add it to your Webflow site and then select "Test connection again".</p><h3>Step 3: Select your email sequence</h3><p>In the "Tasks" column, you can add an email from the template list, or add a specific action, like wait some time.</p><p>Here you can select different actions and set up a whole sequence. For this example I created a simple welcoming sequence for a Webflow landing page to a community:</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="3.png" title="3.png" src="https://blog.palabra.io/static/e8060f3f497f85bbddfd273b36bf9952/7d769/3.png" srcset="https://blog.palabra.io/static/e8060f3f497f85bbddfd273b36bf9952/5243c/3.png 240w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/e8060f3f497f85bbddfd273b36bf9952/ab158/3.png 480w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/e8060f3f497f85bbddfd273b36bf9952/7d769/3.png 960w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/e8060f3f497f85bbddfd273b36bf9952/b1884/3.png 994w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>In this example I would be welcoming prospects to my community, sending them some resources the next day, and then waiting a few days to ask for feedback.</p><p>You can easily edit any template by clicking on each card. It will save automatically.</p><h3>Step 4: Start sending automated emails</h3><p>This step is really really short. Once you are ready, just click "Start actions" and wait for Palabra to do the work for you.</p><p>And that's it. You already automated a welcoming sequence. Congratulations.</p><h4>Pro tip: Try out different sequences</h4><p>Once you get your sequence going, you will find a third column with your sequence's performance. You'll get a full list of contacts that received each email, and stats to know who opened them and who clicked on your call to action:</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="4.png" title="4.png" src="https://blog.palabra.io/static/72e8c4e1d2051060a2d8206508a066a4/96430/4.png" srcset="https://blog.palabra.io/static/72e8c4e1d2051060a2d8206508a066a4/5243c/4.png 240w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/72e8c4e1d2051060a2d8206508a066a4/ab158/4.png 480w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/72e8c4e1d2051060a2d8206508a066a4/96430/4.png 933w" sizes="(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>Try out changing your templates or the order in which emails get sent to see if your open ratio improves.</p><p>Hope you enjoyed this tutorial! If you are curious about what else you can do with Palabra or would just like to try it go ahead an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.palabra.io/">create an account here</a>.</p><p>If you have any questions just send us a quick email, we'll be more than happy to hear your thoughts!</p><hr><p>Hope you enjoyed this tutorial!

            <br>

            <ul>
                <li>Anything worth doing, is worth doing well.</li>
                <li><i>Everything</i> that gets added to your product should be considered.</li>
                <li>There is never a time when you should be O.K to just “add a button”. Someone in the process should have thought deeply about it, or you should have. It’s the only way to create lasting products.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you agree with the above, let’s continue on this journey. If not <a href="https://twitter.com/philipardeljan">tweet me</a> or comment below :)</p>

            <p>Doing lots of things quickly feels good. It's human nature. Cranking out work gives an outward semblance of progress. In the context of product design however, an expression comes to mind:</p>

            <blockquote><h3>"Quiet, calm deliberation disentangles every knot"</h3></blockquote>
            <blockquote><small>Gilbert and Sullivan</small></blockquote>

            <p>As product designers, we are tasked with solving difficult problems. To solve these problems our initial inclination can be to design a fancy new interface. At times, the result of good design can be making no change at all or even removing something entirely.</p>

            <p>The main challenge with adding things to a product is that after some time, people expect it to always be there. There is so much inertia once something is in place and is being used. You can’t remove it easily. This is why adding something in the first place is such an important decision. With user interface design, quality is better than quantity. You can only fit so much onto a screen at any given time so difficult decisions need to be made.</p>

            <blockquote><h3>"Just add in this button"</h3></blockquote>
            <blockquote><small>A co-worker, probably</small></blockquote>

            <p>Sometimes I think about a small piece of UI for a long time. And a lot of the time it feels unproductive. It feels so weird to spend half a day thinking deeply about a button. But the presence of <i>one more button</i> within a user interface could make or break it.</p>

            <h3>UI scenario: Add a button to this screen to let users do (x).</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Does this button need to exist in the UI? (despite being mandated I always consider this first. As an interface designer, you are responsible to ensure the interface works for users first.)</li>
                <li>Do all users need to see it, or just a subset or users?</li>
                <li>Does the button have more or less importance than the elements around it?</li>
                <li>Does adding this button distract too much from the existing functions?</li>
                <li>With all of this in mind, have I struck the right balance?</li>
                <li>How does the information architecture hold up?</li>
                <li>What existing UI patterns do we have for this button (if any)?</li>
                <li>Does this button need to persist after being actioned once/twice/etc?</li>
                <li>Does this button have multiple states? If so, what are they?</li>
                <li>Does it need to be touch friendly and have a big tap target?</li>
                <li>Will this element animate? Where from/to? Why?</li>
                <li>and so on…</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is a considered approach to UI design. It will ensure that the user always has the best experience when using your product. The compounding effects of strong design decisions quickly stack up. Kind of like compounding interest.</p>

            <h3>UX scenario: The user should be able to do (x).</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>How does the user currently do (x)? </li>
                <li>Is the user having to use a workaround to do (x)?</li>
                <li>By allowing the user to do (x) are we creating future problems?</li>
                <li>Does (x) align with our wider product strategy?</li>
                <li>How should we test our design of (x) with users?</li>
                <li>Do we already have anything in the roadmap that will solve (x)?</li>
                <li>Will we need to re-work our solution to (x) in the short/medium term?</li>
                <li>Do we have competitors that allow users to do (x)? If so, how do they do it?</li>
                <li>and so on…</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These are some of the questions I ask myself when adding elements to an existing interface. When designing an entirely new user interface there are many more considerations I take into account. Maybe for another blog post :)</p>

            <p>So what are the takeaways? If you want to kill your product, make lots of design decisions really quickly. And do that for a sustained period of time.</p>

            <p>If you want a well designed product that is both a joy to use and to work on, go slow to go fast. Good design is like slow cooked food, the process is long but the outcome is always worth it. </p>

<![CDATA[Keeping NetBSD up-to-date with pkg_comp 2.0]]>

July 21, 2020 | https://jmmv.dev/2017/02/pkg_comp-2.0-tutorial-netbsd.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jmmv.dev/2017/02/pkg_comp-2.0-tutorial-netbsd.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <div>
              
              <article><p>This is a tutorial to guide you through the <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2017/02/introducing-pkg_comp-2.0.html">shiny new pkg_comp 2.0</a> on NetBSD.</p>

<p><strong>Goals:</strong> to use pkg_comp 2.0 to build a binary repository of all the packages you are interested in; to keep the repository fresh on a daily basis; and to use that repository with pkgin to maintain your NetBSD system up-to-date and secure.</p>

<p>This tutorial is specifically targeted at NetBSD but should work on other platforms with some small changes.  Expect, at the very least, a macOS-specific tutorial as soon as I create a pkg_comp standalone installer for that platform.</p>



<p>First install the <code>sysutils/sysbuild-user</code> package and trigger a full build of NetBSD so that you get usable release sets for pkg_comp.  See <code>sysbuild(1)</code> and <code>pkg_info sysbuild-user</code> for details on how to do so.  Alternatively, <a href="https://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/">download release sets from the FTP site</a> and later tell pkg_comp where they are.</p>

<p>Then install the <code>pkgtools/pkg_comp-cron</code> package.  The rest of this tutorial assumes you have done so.</p>



<p>To use pkg_comp for periodic builds, you’ll need to do some minimal edits to the default configuration files.  The files can be found directly under <code>/var/pkg_comp/</code>, which is <code>pkg_comp-cron</code>’s “home”:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>/var/pkg_comp/pkg_comp.conf</code>: This is pkg_comp’s own configuration file and the defaults installed by <code>pkg_comp-cron</code> should be good to go.</p>

<p>The contents here are divided in three major sections: declaration on how to download pkgsrc, definition of the file system layout on the host machine, and definition of the file system layout for the built packages.</p>

<p>You may want to customize the target system paths, such as <code>LOCALBASE</code> or <code>SYSCONFDIR</code>, but you should not have to customize the host system paths.</p></li>

<li><p><code>/var/pkg_comp/sandbox.conf</code>: This is the configuration file for sandboxctl.  The default settings installed by <code>pkg_comp-cron</code> <em>should</em> suffice if you used the <code>sysutils/sysbuild-user</code> package as recommended; otherwise tweak the <code>NETBSD_NATIVE_RELEASEDIR</code> and <code>NETBSD_SETS_RELEASEDIR</code> variables to point to where the downloaded release sets are.</p></li>

<li><p><code>/var/pkg_comp/extra.mk.conf</code>: This is pkgsrc’s own configuration file.  In here, you should configure things like the licenses that are acceptable to you and the package-specific options you’d like to set.  You should <em>not</em> configure the layout of the installed files (e.g. <code>LOCALBASE</code>) because that’s handled internally by pkg_comp as specified in <code>pkg_comp.conf</code>.</p></li>

<li><p><code>/var/pkg_comp/list.txt</code>: This determines the set of packages you want to build in your periodic cron job.  The builds will fail unless you list at least one package.</p>

<p>WARNING: Make sure to include <code>pkg_comp-cron</code> and <code>pkgin</code> in this list so that your binary kit includes these essential package management tools.  Otherwise you’ll have to deal with some minor annoyances after rebootstrapping your system.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly, review root’s <code>crontab</code> to ensure the job specification for pkg_comp is sane.  On slow machines, or if you are building many packages, you will probably want to decrease the build frequency from <code>@daily</code> to <code>@weekly</code>.</p>



<p>Here is what the configuration looks like on my NetBSD development machine as dumped by the <code>config</code> subcommand.  Use this output to get an idea of what to expect.  I’ll be using the values shown here in the rest of the tutorial:</p>

<pre><code># pkg_comp -c /var/pkg_comp/pkg_comp.conf config
AUTO_PACKAGES = autoconf automake bash colordiff dash emacs-nox11 git-base git-docs gmake gnuls lua52 mozilla-rootcerts pdksh pkg_comp-cron pkg_developer pkgin sqlite3 sudo sysbuild sysbuild-user sysupgrade tmux vim zsh

PACKAGES = /var/pkg_comp/packages
PBULK_PACKAGES = /var/pkg_comp/pbulk-packages
PKG_DBDIR = /usr/pkg/libdata/pkgdb
PKGSRCDIR = /var/pkg_comp/pkgsrc
SANDBOX_CONFFILE = /var/pkg_comp/sandbox.conf
SYSCONFDIR = /etc
UPDATE_SOURCES = true
VARBASE = /var

NETBSD_NATIVE_RELEASEDIR = /home/sysbuild/release/amd64
NETBSD_RELEASE_RELEASEDIR = /home/sysbuild/release/amd64
NETBSD_RELEASE_SETS is undefined
SANDBOX_ROOT = /var/pkg_comp/sandbox
SANDBOX_TYPE = netbsd-release
</code></pre>



<p>Now that you are fully installed and configured, you’ll build some stuff by hand to ensure the setup works before the cron job comes in.</p>

<p>The simplest usage form, which involves full automation, is something like this:</p>

<pre><code># pkg_comp -c /var/pkg_comp/pkg_comp.conf auto
</code></pre>

<p>This trivially-looking command will:</p>

<ol>
<li>checkout or update your copy of pkgsrc;</li>
<li>create the sandbox;</li>
<li>bootstrap pkgsrc and pbulk;</li>
<li>use pbulk to build the given packages; and</li>
<li>destroy the sandbox.</li>
</ol>

<p>After a successful invocation, you’ll be left with a collection of packages in the directory you set in <code>PACKAGES</code>, which in the default <code>pkg_comp-cron</code> installation is <code>/var/pkg_comp/packages/</code>.</p>

<p>If you’d like to restrict the set of packages to build during a manually-triggered build, provide those as arguments to <code>auto</code>.  This will override the contents of <code>AUTO_PACKAGES</code> (which was derived from your <code>list.txt</code> file).</p>

<p>But what if you wanted to invoke all stages separately, bypassing <code>auto</code>?  The command above would be equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code># pkg_comp -c /var/pkg_comp/pkg_comp.conf fetch
# pkg_comp -c /var/pkg_comp/pkg_comp.conf sandbox-create
# pkg_comp -c /var/pkg_comp/pkg_comp.conf bootstrap
# pkg_comp -c /var/pkg_comp/pkg_comp.conf build &lt;package names here&gt;
# pkg_comp -c /var/pkg_comp/pkg_comp.conf sandbox-destroy
</code></pre>

<p>Go ahead and play with these.  You can also use the <code>sandbox-shell</code> command to interactively enter the sandbox.  See <code>pkg_comp(8)</code> for more details.</p>

<p>Lastly note that the root user will receive email messages if the periodic pkg_comp cron job fails, but only if it fails.  That said, you can find the full logs for all builds, successful or not, under <code>/var/pkg_comp/log/</code>.</p>



<p>Now that you have built your first set of packages, you will want to install them.  On NetBSD, the default <code>pkg_comp-cron</code> configuration produces a set of packages for <code>/usr/pkg</code> so you have to wipe your existing packages first to avoid build mismatches.</p>

<p>WARNING: Yes, you really have to wipe your packages.  pkg_comp currently does not recognize the package tools that ship with the NetBSD base system (i.e. it bootstraps pkgsrc unconditionally, including <code>bmake</code>), which means that the newly-built packages won’t be compatible with the ones you already have.  Avoid any trouble by starting afresh.</p>

<p>To clean your system, do something like this:</p>

<pre><code># ... ensure your login shell lives in /bin! ...
# pkg_delete -r -R "*"
# mv /usr/pkg/etc /root/etc.old  # Backup any modified files.
# rm -rf /usr/pkg /var/db/pkg*
</code></pre>

<p>Now, rebootstrap pkgsrc and reinstall any packages you previously had:</p>

<pre><code># cd /
# tar xzvpf /var/pkg_comp/packages/bootstrap.tgz
# echo "pkg_admin=/usr/pkg/sbin/pkg_admin" &gt;&gt;/etc/pkgpath.conf
# echo "pkg_info=/usr/pkg/sbin/pkg_info" &gt;&gt;/etc/pkgpath.conf
# export PATH=/usr/pkg/bin:/usr/pkg/sbin:${PATH}
# export PKG_PATH=file:///var/pkg_comp/packages/All
# pkg_add pkgin pkg_comp-cron &lt;other package names&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, reconfigure any packages where you had have previously made custom edits.  Use the backup in <code>/root/etc.old</code> to properly update the corresponding files in <code>/etc</code>.  I doubt you made a ton of edits so this should be easy.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: Note that the last command in this example includes <code>pkgin</code> and <code>pkg_comp-cron</code>.  You should install these first to ensure you can continue with the next steps in this tutorial.</p>



<p>If you paid attention when you installed the <code>pkg_comp-cron</code> package, you should have noticed that this configured a cron job to run pkg_comp daily.  This means that your packages repository under <code>/var/pkg_comp/packages/</code> will always be up-to-date so you can use that to quickly upgrade your system with minimal downtime.</p>

<p>Assuming you are going to use <code>pkgtools/pkgin</code> (and why not?), configure your local repository:</p>

<pre><code># echo 'file:///var/pkg_comp/packages/All' &gt;&gt;/etc/pkgin/repositories.conf
</code></pre>

<p>And, from now on, all it takes to upgrade your system is:</p>

<pre><code># pkgin update
# pkgin upgrade
</code></pre>

<p>Enjoy!</p></article>

<h3>
What is Nintendo playing at?
</h3>
</div><div>
<div id="post-body-8506159587861018996">
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kNtacp8-GoI" width="320" youtube-src-id="kNtacp8-GoI"></iframe></p><p>Nintendo's latest Direct hit yesterday to mixed reactions. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNtacp8-GoI" target="_blank">video</a>, at the time of writing, has 68,000 dislikes and 87,000 likes. Fans were disappointed at the lack of any major announcements given the drought in Nintendo Directs in recent months. The showcase highlighted <i>Shin Megamei Tensei 5</i>, <i>Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster</i>, some DLC for <i>Cadence of Hyrule</i>, <i>Rogue Company</i> and&nbsp;<i>WWE2K Battlegrounds</i>. That was it. No <i>Doom Eternal</i>, no <i>Bravely Default II</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>While I expect Nintendo will undoubtedly release more smaller Nintendo Directs in due course, there is a much greater issue here.&nbsp;</p><h3>Everyone is talking about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X</h3><p>Nintendo needs to step up to get gamers talking about the Switch again. Right now, the hot topics are the next generation of consoles coming later this year. <a href="https://www.staticcatgames.com/2020/07/will-july-23rd-mark-success-or-failure.html" target="_blank">Microsoft's event on the 23rd</a> is on everyone's lips, for example. If Phil Spencer and co show off a lot of gameplay for <i>Halo: Infinite</i> and other first party games, this could turn out to be an incredible event.&nbsp; Microsoft's Xbox Series S/Project Lockhart is supposedly going to be unveiled in August, adding even more impetus.&nbsp;</p><p>I wouldn't be surprised if Sony released more information to combat the impact of Microsoft's event, perhaps even the price and launch date.&nbsp;</p><h3>What can Nintendo do to get the buzz going again?</h3><div><ul><li>Mario games in celebration of the 35th anniversary.</li><li>Announce <i>Breath of the Wild 2</i>.</li><li>Nintendo 64 games coming to the Switch.</li><li>New [insert old IP] here - imagine the reaction if a new <i>Wave Race</i> or <i>F-Zero </i>was announced?</li><li>Announce a Game Boy Classic.</li><li>Announce<i> GoldenEye 007</i> coming to the Switch.</li><li>Say "<a href="https://www.staticcatgames.com/2020/07/what-next-for-nintendo.html" target="_blank">Switch Pro</a> - coming 2021"</li></ul><p>What about Todd Howard showing a video of him playing <i>Fallout 3</i> (or 4) on the Switch? That would be incredible.&nbsp;</p><p>If Nintendo really wanted to do something EPIC, all it has to do is release a video of Phil Spencer playing <i>Halo: Infinite</i>...on a Switch running xCloud.&nbsp;</p></div><p><b>BOOM!&nbsp;</b></p><p>And the crowd goes wild.</p><h3>Closing thoughts</h3><p>There is always the risk of complacency. Nintendo could decide not to do anything until September, which might be damaging. I expect Sony will release more info about the PlayStation 5 at some point, especially since we don't know the price or launch date. There might be more gameplay footage to come. Microsoft might have a busy August if they announce the Xbox Series S/Project Lockhart then. Nintendo could make a splash by announcing <i>Super Mario Galaxy 1 &amp; 2 </i>on the Switch or S<i>uper Mario Sunshine Remastered. </i>That would guarantee a lot of interest and pre-orders.&nbsp;</p><p>What do you think? Is Nintendo on the right track or should it do more to get everyone talking about the Switch and their games?</p><h2>If you liked reading this post, please check out some of my others</h2>

						<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Yepp, more things I wish I'd known when I started, 6th edition.</p>
<p><em>You can find the first article in the series <a href="https://www.brainstobytes.com/advice-for-new-developers-or-things-i-wish-i-had-known-when-i-started-to-program/">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>And the previous article <a href="https://www.brainstobytes.com/advice-for-new-developers-or-things-i-wish-i-had-known-when-i-started-programming-part-5">here</a></em></p>
<h2 id="donttrytopredictthefuture">Don't try to predict the future</h2>
<p>We suck at predicting the future.</p>
<p>Every time you make an architectural/design decision, you close options in your design and constrain your program’s options for change. Designing is balancing the current needs (requirements) with possible future change requests.</p>
<p>Your main goal is to satisfy the current requirements and leaving as many open options as possible to accommodate future changes. If you get a hunch that in the future you will get a request for X feature and design to accommodate that, two things can happen:</p>
<p>1- The request comes, and hurray! you can easily sneak it in.</p>
<p>2- The request never came, and you end up with a subpar design that doesn’t relate to your current requirements, shame on you.</p>
<p>Because the second thing is more likely to happen, you avoid making the rookie mistake of designing for things you are not sure will come later.</p>
<p>Design is about balancing two things: satisfying current requirements and leaving open as many options as possible. You want to keep flexibility, and designing for hunches poses unnecessary constraints in your program.</p>
<p>So go for designs that are easy to extend and don't build towards a feature that might never come.</p>
<h2 id="communicatewiththeusersofyoursoftware">Communicate with the users of your software</h2>
<p>In a previous article in this series, we talked about our role as software developers. Our job, above writing code, is to provide value.</p>
<p>The most important prerequisites for being able to provide value is to know what our users need. Communication with end-users is important because as the creators of the software, we tend to have skewed ideas about the products we make.</p>
<p>There are many features and usability aspects that are obvious for us, but not for the users. Things that for us seem clear and intuitive can be difficult for people who... well, who didn't create the product. Communicating with users and understanding what they love and what they hate about our products is an important part of crafting the right solution.</p>
<p>It's true that we don't have those many chances to do this, but if there is a situation where you can talk to a user go for it. If it's not possible at all, become best buddies with your product owner and get regular feedback.</p>
<p>Remember that there are few things as sad as building a great product that solves the wrong problem.</p>
<h2 id="dontbeatechnomartyr">Don't be a technomartyr</h2>
<p>Career is important, but so is your private life.</p>
<p>I know this might not apply to you, but our profession is full of people who work a ton of extra hours. Neglecting family, friends and personal life in order to ship that extra feature is quite common among software developers.</p>
<p>I know you might need to stay in the office for a couple of extra hours on special occasions, it happens to everyone. But continuous neglect of other aspects of your life is impossible to sustain in the long term.</p>
<p>We are human beings, and the need to cultivate relationships and hobbies is an integral part of who we are. Having a network of healthy relationships around us not only makes us happier, but it also helps us produce better quality work. A happy and well-rested person with other interests tends to fare better in the long run.</p>
<p>It's not that extreme sacrifices will make you a star employee forever. Sooner or later you will burn out and your relationships will deteriorate, something that will ultimately impact your productivity if that's the only thing that matters.</p>
<p>So, spend time nourishing what matters. Your job will still be there later, and you will probably switch jobs several times in the following decades. Bet for sustainable growth and nourish all the aspects of your life.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Reading time: 4-6 minutes</p><p>Lately, I've seen a trend of products being offered as a subscription. I receive every month a set of products that I regularly consume, which I prefer to receive on the commodity of my house rather than buy it from the store.&nbsp; Companies are looking to take advantage of the <a href="https://www.firmhouse.com/blog/embracing-digital-transformation-with-as-a-service">digital transformation</a> that makes people buy more online and get their favorite products conveniently.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In this article, we explain what is really a <a href="https://www.firmhouse.com/blog/subscription-services-are-here-to-stay">subscription</a> product, what benefits it has for companies, and how you can start and manage your subscription product.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>Let’s start by defining what is a subscription product?</strong></h3><p>A subscription product is when a customer pays to have access to a product as a subscription and get billed on a recurring schedule.<br></p><p>Subscription products are on the rise, and they will gain more popularity over time as more customers adopt this model.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><h4><strong>Subscription products have three powerful benefits for your company:</strong></h4><ul role="list"><li>Enhances customer loyalty: increasing the number of successful interactions that your customers have with your business.<br></li></ul><ul role="list"><li>Improve cash flow: with subscription products, your customer doesn't have to pay upfront, but they will have to pay for a period of time, which helps you to receive recurring revenue.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><ul role="list"><li>As a revenue stream: Allowing new customers to access your product as a subscription is a great way to receive additional revenue streams from different customer segments.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>There are different types of subscription products, so <strong>which kind of products are best for subscriptions?</strong> Of course, this depends on the industry, but in short, it has to be a product that your customer consumes regularly or a product that is expensive to buy upfront.</p><p>‍<br></p><h4><strong>Type of products that can easily be offered as a subscription:</strong></h4><ul role="list"><li>Consumable or disposable products are a great choice for e-commerce subscriptions.&nbsp;</li><li>Expensive products, such as electronics or furniture.</li><li>Products that people use regularly and need to be replaced.</li><li>Products that your customer consumes, wear or recycle after its use.</li></ul><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5e4302c3ff8f98b64643b252/5f16b998a23f5233cb557b1d_Subcription%20products.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>6 Industries Offering Subscription Products</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h3><strong>6 industries that are offering subscription products:</strong></h3><ol role="list"><li><a href="https://www.firmhouse.com/as-a-service-index-industries/home-furniture">Furniture</a></li><li><a href="https://www.firmhouse.com/as-a-service-index-industries/consumer-electronics">Electronics</a></li><li>Vitamins</li><li>Food</li><li>Fashion</li><li>Children's toys and clothing</li></ol><p>‍<br></p><h3><strong>3 Examples of product subscriptions:</strong></h3><ol role="list"><li>Food</li></ol><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://www.blueapron.com/">Blue apron</a> - $8.74/serving</li><li><a href="https://www.graze.com/uk/">Graze</a> - $11.99/week</li><li><a href="https://naturebox.com/">Nature box</a> - $25/month</li><li><a href="https://farmtopeople.com/">Farm to people</a> - $24.99/month<br></li></ul><ol start="2" role="list"><li>Kids</li></ol><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://www.kiwico.com/">Kiwi crate</a> - $19.95/month</li><li><a href="https://www.honest.com/">Honest company</a> - $39.95/month</li><li><a href="https://www.greenkidcrafts.com/">Green kid crafts</a> - $19.95/month</li><li><a href="https://www.wecraftbox.com/">We craft box </a>- $24.99/month<br></li></ul><ol start="3" role="list"><li>Grooming and fashion-men</li></ol><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://www.birchbox.com/">Birchbox</a> - $20/month</li><li><a href="https://www.bespokepost.com/">Bespoke</a> - $45/month</li><li><a href="https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/">Dollar shave club</a> - $1/month<br></li></ul><p>‍</p><h3><strong>7 Steps that can help you when starting your product subscription:</strong><br></h3><ol role="list"><li>Make sure to offer something customers want: First, start by deciding which product(s) you'll offer as a subscription. Stick to one or two product offerings at the beginning to test what works and the reception from the people.&nbsp;Keep in mind that this doesn't mean you can't have all your products as a subscription, if you are a company that sells more than 1 product or that plans to expand). Start with the one that will be the most suitable for the audience you try to convince. This could be your most popular product or a new product that you are trying to test in the market.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="2" role="list"><li>Once you pick a product to sell as a subscription, you'll need a tool to manage your sales and operations since doing the process manually can get messy when you have a handful of customers. As you scale, you need to manage your subscribers; otherwise, it can become unmanageable.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="3" role="list"><li>Billing is one of the most complex aspects, especially if you offer different product variations such as <a href="https://fabfitfun.com/get-the-box/?step=getbox&amp;#plan=fffvip">Fat Fit Fun</a>, with the ability to choose what goes on the box or specific customer needs.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="4" role="list"><li>Give customers a try-before you buy option. Aren't your customers ready to subscribe? Ask them to buy for one month so they can try it and see if they like it.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="5" role="list"><li>Ensure customers have an option to suggest your product to friends. From the very beginning of your subscription business think of a strategy so customers can refer you to other people.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="6" role="list"><li>Another option is to send a special discount with the product if they refer more people or suggest your product to their friends. This is valuable if you are trying to scale fast. It would give you a network effect that can help you promote your product and ultimately grow.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="7" role="list"><li>Make sure all product items are clear. If you deliver on the 11th of every month, can a subscriber get your product if they sign up on the 9th? If a customer travels, can they change their address or pause their subscription? Take this into consideration and communicate it with customers so they can better understand how your subscription works.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>‍<br></p><h3><strong>What is a subscription management software, and what has to do with subscription products?&nbsp;</strong><br></h3><p>If you are thinking of offering a product as a subscription, you should make sure some aspects are covered before starting.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Some of the aspects to consider when starting your product as a subscription are; your <a href="https://www.firmhouse.com/blog/the-product-as-a-service-business-case-calculator">customer lifecycles</a>, trials, credit checks, operations, refunds, logistics, and subscription changes.&nbsp;<br></p><p>A subscription management software oversees the interaction between your business and the customers, which is more complete and different from just recurring billing.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Subscription management software helps you update your customers' information, upgrade/downgrade subscriptions, perform customer-oriented tasks, customer communications, and dunning management.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Meanwhile, recurring billing helps you only generate an invoice (including location-based taxes), tracking payments, and safely storing payment information.</p><p>‍<br></p><h3><strong>8 ways in which a subscription management tool or software can help you with your subscription product:&nbsp;</strong><br></h3><ol role="list"><li>Easily track changes from the customer, such as; <a href="https://www.firmhouse.com/blog/how-to-reduce-subscriber-churn-5-helpful-tips-to-try">credit card expiration</a>, contact information updates, and the possibility of upgrading or downgrading their subscription.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="2" role="list"><li>Instantly access the historical data from your customer: view invoices, cancelations, deliveries, and much more.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="3" role="list"><li>Have a self-service portal where customers can find all the necessary information for their product subscription.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="4" role="list"><li>Communication with subscribers is key: Subscription management improves your overall customer's experience by enhancing communication with your subscribers.<br></li></ol><ol start="5" role="list"><li>Dunning management helps you set pre-determined communications to reach out to customers throughout their lifecycle.<br></li></ol><ol start="6" role="list"><li>Ensure revenue recovery and communicate when a payment or a transaction fails. A subscription management software also helps you contact subscribers to let them know their credit card is about to expire.&nbsp;</li></ol><ol start="7" role="list"><li>A subscription management software stores your: subscribers data, any add-ons, product catalog and prices, history of transactions, and billing cycles.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="8" role="list"><li>Subscription management works on top of a payment processor to support billing. It allows teams to take actions that need to be automated, such as customer signs up or special discounts or trial periods.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><p>Having your product as a subscription enhances customer loyalty, it is a great revenue stream and improves your business cash flow.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Some of the best products to have as a subscription are; products that are used more frequently with the possibility to be recycled after or products that are expensive to pay upfront. Industries such as; furniture, electronics, vitamins, and children's toys are well suited to start offering product subscriptions.&nbsp;<br></p><p>A subscription management software helps you oversee your customer interactions and make sure you run operations smoothly.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Are you looking to start offering your products as a subscription? <a href="https://www.firmhouse.com/contact">Request a demo</a> for free today and start using our subscription platform today.&nbsp;<br></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Many applications today still rely on traditional SQL databases like MySQL, MariaDb or PostgreSQL for data storage and data processing. With the growing amount of data and new workloads that are made with this database systems, we often find ourselves in situations where we need to think about scaling such systems.</p>



<p>When it comes to scaling, we might need to think about:</p>



<ul><li>data storage, if we store more and more data and it becomes expensive or slow working with them</li><li>fast INSERTs and UPDATES for write-heavy workloads</li><li>making SELECT queries faster because of their complexity or because they need to query huge amounts of data</li><li>concurrency if we have many clients interacting with the database</li></ul>



<p>In this article, I will present some basic ideas and starting points on scaling traditional SQL databases.</p>



<h3>Update the database</h3>



<p>Newer versions of MySQL, PostgreSQL and other traditional SQL databases typically come with performance improvements. Even if the newer database system is not faster as a direct replacement, there might be new features available that we can take advantage of. Keeping our database system up to date expands our options on what we can do with our data and gives us the best out of the box performance. It is a basic enabler for scaling.</p>



<h3>Scale vertically</h3>



<p>The most intuitive idea of scaling is to use better hardware to scale vertically (on one database server). When it comes to hardware we typically look at CPUs, disk and RAM:</p>



<ul><li>The number of CPUs affects how many queries the database can run and therefore how many clients can be served</li><li>The size of RAM gives us space for indexes, temporary tables and caches the database can store in a fast memory which makes our system faster due to minimizing IO access to disk</li><li>Disk IO speed highly affects the query times, especially for full scan reads (when indexes cannot be used) or for write-heavy systems</li><li>Disk size allows us to store more data</li></ul>



<h3>Leverage application cache</h3>



<p>If the application’s code is in our control we can cache data in a memory store like <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> or <a href="https://memcached.org/">Memcached</a> to avoid querying the database. We don’t have to just cache database reads, but we can also use such systems as buffers for writes, e.g. when we are collecting analytical data and a possible delay is not a problem.</p>



<h3>Use efficient data types</h3>



<p>When it comes to data, it all starts with data types, in other words how individual pieces of information are physically stored in memory. Choosing appropriate data types is always a balance between efficiency and functionality, affecting the required memory, query performance and number of operations we can do with the specific data type.</p>



<p>There are two basic ways to think about optimal data types:</p>



<ul><li>logical: how to store general information like a telephone number or an IP address; for instance we can store color as a string, enum or as a collection of RGB integers and we can store IP address as a string or as bytes</li><li>physical: what specific data types we choose for strings, integers or time since we typically have multiple options; e.g. date and time can be typically stored as a timestamp (faster but with limited date range and functionality) or as a more complex datetime which is more developer friendly and flexible, allowing to store timezone etc.</li></ul>



<p>Using an appropriate type for a database column is especially important when we want to index the column, use it in the WHERE clause, use it for joins or when we have a lot of data.</p>



<h3>Data normalization and denormalization</h3>



<p>We are often trained to normalize data for relational databases in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. While this is generally useful, we might want to reconsider it for some of our data when it comes to scaling.</p>



<p>Generally speaking the simpler we make our data to be retrieved or saved, the more of it we can have.</p>



<h3>Precompute data</h3>



<p>A lot of SELECT queries can be optimized by having the data already in the requested form. This can be handy for analyzing large amounts of data. For instance, instead of aggregating data every time, we can aggregate them beforehand. Of course this isn’t always possible, e.g. we cannot aggregate other average aggregates because we would lose precision.</p>



<h3>Leverage materialized views</h3>



<p>Materialized views are continuously updated data that are updated on write operations or on scheduled time and can be seen as an extension of the previous point. Unlike classic views, materialized views are physically stored and don’t need to be computed when needed. This is useful for situations where a SELECT query would take a long time to produce the result.</p>



<p>As an example, look at <a href="https://www.pipelinedb.com/">PipelineDB</a> extension for PostgreSQL that produces aggregates on real-time data, allowing us to keep aggregated statistics on a write-heavy systems.</p>



<h3>Use proper indexes</h3>



<p>Using the right indexes on tables can be a huge performance changer. Typically, we should index the columns by which we want to query the data or which we want to use to perform joins. However, adding indexes can also reduce performance for write-heavy workloads, since indexes have to be updated on every INSERT and UPDATE. Also it doesn’t make sense to use indexes on some data types. So it is all about finding the right balance.</p>



<h3>Leverage the execution plan for query optimization</h3>



<p>For optimizing reads we need to know how the database query planner will execute our queries. We can use EXPLAIN statement to obtain the execution plan that the SQL server will use for our query.</p>



<p>Here we should look if the database plans to use any of the existing indexes on the tables or plans to make a full table scan. It can give us hints whether we should change the structure of our data, add indexes or rewrite the query in a different way. Please note however that full table scan can be also faster or necessary for some queries so it is not a black and white situation.</p>



<h3>Choose correct transaction isolation level</h3>



<p>The most common relational databases use multi-version concurrency control and make locking very granular (instead of locking the whole table, like MyISAM storage engine does). However, we still need to tell the database how exactly should the concurrency control behave and we can do so by setting appropriate transaction isolation level. There are 4 basic isolation levels in SQL:1992 standard and they will greatly affect how our database system behaves.</p>



<h3>Bulk INSERTs and UPDATEs</h3>



<p>Writing or updating individual rows in a table is not efficient, but databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL have ways to insert or modify data in bulk. We should leverage this every time we can.</p>



<h3>Compress data for storage</h3>



<p>Many times we don’t need to query the data by all the columns in a table. If this is the case, we can further optimize the storage size by storing some of the columns in a compressed form. This is especially useful for strings or some types of binary data.</p>



<p>Some databases or their extensions might be already compressing data under the hood so it always makes sense to look first how the data are stored and whether adding compression on the application layer would bring the desired benefit.</p>



<h3>Make ALTER TABLEs work</h3>



<p>When the amount of data or the workload grows we will experience slower and slower ALTER TABLEs to the point where some of them might not finish in a reasonable time. The first important thing to know is that there are typically two ways of changing the structure of the database tables. One is INPLACE, modifying the original table and the other one is COPY, creating a new table and moving the data afterwards. Databases typically try to modify tables INPLACE if possible, but it might make sense sometimes to explicitly ask for the COPY operation.</p>



<p>When adding a new column, it is better to add it at the end of the table, since inserting a column at a specific place is slow.</p>



<p>When changing existing column it might be a good idea to create a new column first, copy the data and remove the column afterwards.</p>



<p>If the write operations on the table make it difficult to perform ALTER TABLE, it makes sense to stop clients from writing into the table first. This is not always possible, but e.g. collection of analytical data can be postponed using an ingestion buffer in front of the database or we can temporarily pause our ETL jobs working with the table.</p>



<p>The last resort is to simply not do any ALTER TABLEs on large and write-heavy tables, opting for creating a new table to store the new data instead.</p>



<h3>Manage concurrent connections</h3>



<p>Every database server comes with some basic configuration on the maximum number of concurrent connections. When we need more, we typically need to reconfigure this value. Just increasing the value is not enough though – we need to make sure that our system can actually run well with our desired number of connections.</p>



<h3>Add read replicas</h3>



<p>Traditional SQL databases can’t typically scale horizontally for write operations by adding more servers, but we can still add other machines in the form of read-only replicas. The way this works is that all write operations are done on the main server and propagated to other machines using Write Ahead Log. All the replicas will therefore apply the same operations in the same order to the underlying storage as the main server. This ensures that the data will be in sync.</p>



<p>Replicas can be then used for scaling the number of read queries and number of connected clients if they only need read operations.</p>



<h3>Disk partitioning</h3>



<p>Partitioning allows us to distribute one single table across the filesystem and store individual partitions based on some specific rules. When such rules are chosen well, SQL queries don’t have to query all partitions but can limit their search only to a subset of them. This will cut the time the query will run since not the whole database table needs to be looked into.</p>



<h3>Use specialized extensions</h3>



<p>When we need to store and work with geospatial, time series and other …</p></div></div>

It is also a favourite of Charlie Munger (Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffets mate) - "...it is in the nature of things that many hard problems are best solved when they are addressed backward", he pontificates.</p><p>In another interview, he recalls how, as an Air Force meteorologist during World War II, instead of asking what would keep pilots safe, he asked what would kill them and focussed all his efforts "on trying to predict snow, ice or fog—and to ignore pretty much everything else.".</p><p>I could write a book on all the other cool stuff Charlie Munger has said so I'll stop here.</p><h3 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h3><p>Inversion is based on the maxim - invert, always, invert. It is about considering an inverse (usually a negative) outcome and listing the reasons for these. It forces you to either stop doing certain things or avoid the actions that lead to the negative outcomes. It gives us <em><em>new possibilities</em> and capabilities</em> that we might not have considered otherwise.</p><p>The algorithm for inversion is very simple:</p><ul><li><strong>Define the problem</strong> - what is it that &nbsp;you're trying to achieve?</li><li><strong>Invert it </strong>- what would guarantee the failure to achieve this outcome?</li><li>Finally, <strong>consider solutions to avoid this failure</strong></li></ul><p>This is very abstract and vague, so let's look at a few examples:</p><ol><li>Instead of asking how do we increase the adoption of a product or feature? You could instead consider - what are some of things preventing adoption? This would lead to a list like this that you could potentially fix:</li></ol><ul><li>Slow load time i.e. performance issues</li><li>Not enough marketing, or marketing on the platform, or to the wrong audience</li><li>The user guide instructions are not clear ... you get the idea</li></ul><p>2. &nbsp;Following the inversion principle it is <em>better to ask</em> what is preventing me from reading all the unread books on my kindle/bookshelf, instead of asking how can i read more books? Possible reasons and something you could give up:</p><ul><li>I spend a lot of time on social media</li><li>I watch too many shows on Netflix or Disney +</li><li>Spend a lot of time on reddit or browsing hacker news</li></ul><p>3. Instead of wondering how do I always choose a winning stock during investing, ask yourself how do you prevent losses in the long term?</p><ul><li>Am I diversifying enough to prevent long term loss?</li><li>Am I investing &nbsp;based on sound principles, or am I speculating? </li></ul><p>Hopefully this &nbsp;gives you a flavour of how powerful inversion is as a mental model. I should add that it is NOT a silver bullet and it won't always give you concrete answers, but it will act as a forcing function to avoid obvious lapses in judgment.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><p>TLDR; Feature stores are the new cool kids in the neighbourhood of Data engineering and AI (artificial intelligence). Hyperscale&nbsp; AI companies (such as Uber, Netflix) have <a href="http://www.featurestore.org/">built their own feature stores</a> to solve the problems of reusing, governing and securing access to features (data for AI) in a shared platform. Hopsworks is a modular open-source platform, developed by Logical Clocks, for managing data for AI (a standalone Feature Store), computing features (Spark, Python), and training models. In this post, we introduce the project-based multi-tenancy security model in Hopsworks for users, data, and programs. We describe how our project-based multi-tenant security model is, in effect, a form of dynamic role-based access control with zero performance overhead.</p><figure id="w-node-591b61e7aa1b-87a4da24"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f10585a943c7738c589d3c5_Screenshot%202020-07-16%20at%2015.38.14.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><a href="https://www.logicalclocks.com/blog/introducing-hopsworks-ai">Hopsworks.ai</a> is a SaaS version of Hopsworks, currently available on AWS. Hopsworks clusters can be run with an IAM profile, providing them with an identity in AWS with permission policies that capture what operations the Hopsworks cluster is authorized to perform in AWS - such as read/write data in S3 buckets. Hopsworks can also be used from Data Science and Feature Engineering platforms (Databricks, Sagemaker, KubeFlow, EMR) using API keys exported from Hopsworks.</p><p>This post is concerned primarily with the internal security model in Hopsworks that enables you to host sensitive data in a shared cluster, providing powerful access control and self-service capabilities. The benefit of Hopsworks project-based multi-tenancy model is that you can host many users and feature stores (and other projects) on a single cluster, with self-service access to different feature stores. The advantage of our security model is that you can host production, staging, and development feature stores in a single cluster - you do not need to manage and pay for separate clusters.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control#:~:text=Role%2Dbased%20access%20control%20(RBAC)%20is%20a%20policy%2D,simple%20to%20perform%20user%20assignments.">Role-based access control</a> (RBAC) is a well-known security model that enables administrators to give a group of users the same access rights to selected resources. With roles, an administrator at a company could define a single security policy and apply it to all members of a department. But individuals may be members of multiple departments, so a user might be given multiple roles. <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-85776-1_17">Dynamic role-based access control</a> means that, based on some other policy, you can change the set of roles a user can hold at a given time. For example, if a user has two different roles - one for accessing banking data and another one for accessing trading data, with dynamic RBAC, you could restrict the user to only allow her to hold one of those roles at a given time. The policy for deciding which role the user holds could, for example, depend on what VPN (virtual private network) the user is logged in to or what building the user is present in. In effect, dynamic roles would allow to hold only one of the roles at a time and sandbox her inside one of the domains - banking or trading. It would prevent her from cross-linking or copying data between the different trading and banking domains.</p><p>Hopsworks implements a dynamic role-based access control model through a project-based <strong>multi-tenant security model. </strong>Inspired by GDPR, in Hopsworks a <em>Project </em>is a sandboxed set of users, data, and programs (where data can be shared in a controlled manner between projects). Every Project has an <strong>owner</strong> with full read-write privileges and zero or more <strong>members</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>A project owner may invite other users to his/her project as either a <strong>Data Scientist </strong>(read-only privileges and run jobs privileges) or <strong>Data Owner</strong> (full privileges). Users can be members of (or own) multiple Projects, but inside each project, each member (user) has a unique identity - we call it a <em>project-user identity</em>.&nbsp; For example, user <em>Alice</em> in <em>Project A</em> is different from user <em>Alice </em>in <em>Project B - </em>(in fact, the system-wide (project-user) identities are <strong><em>ProjectA__Alice</em></strong> and <strong><em>ProjectB__Alice</em></strong>, respectively)<em>. </em>As such, each project-user identity is effectively a role with the project-level privileges to access data and run programs inside that project. If a user is a member of multiple projects, she has, in effect, multiple possible roles, but only one role can be active at a time when performing an action inside Hopsworks. When a user performs an action (for example, runs a program) it will be executed with the project-user identity. That is, the action will only have the privileges associated with that project. The figure below illustrates how Alice has a different identity for each of the two projects (A and B) that she is a member of. Each project contains its own separate private assets. Alice can use only one identity at a time which guarantees that she can’t access assets from both projects at the same time.<br></p><figure id="w-node-20ac5438fa1d-87a4da24"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f1058b3943c77358489d4b1_Screenshot%202020-07-16%20at%2015.39.44.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>An <strong>important </strong>aspect of Project based multi-tenancy is that assets can be shared between projects - sharing does not mean that data is duplicated. The current assets that can be shared between projects are: files/directories in HopsFS, Hive databases, feature stores, and Kafka topics. For example, in the figure below there are three users (User1, User2, and User3)&nbsp; and two projects (A and B). User1 is a member of project A, while User2 and User3 are members of project B. All three users (User1, User2, User3) can access the assets shared between project A and project B. As sharing does not mean copying, the access control rules for the asset are updated to give users in the other project read or write permissions on the shared asset.</p><figure id="w-node-7c5391a82675-87a4da24"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f1059150895622a73e57f16_Screenshot%202020-07-16%20at%2015.40.47.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>As we will see later on, <em>project-user identity</em> is based on a X.509 certificate issued internally by Hopsworks. Access control policies, however, are implemented by the platform services:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>files/directories permissions for HopsFS, Hive (storage-based security policy), and the offline Feature Store;</li><li>Kafka ACLs using a <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/hops-kafka-authorizer">Hopsworks project-based authorizer plugin</a>;</li><li>Elasticsearch Open Distro permissions using a <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/elasticsearch-chef">Hopsworks project-based authorizer plugin</a>.</li></ul><h3>User Identity in Hopsworks</h3><p>When a user authenticates with Hopsworks, they are logged into the platform with a <em>Hopsworks user identity</em>. This user identity is needed to be able to construct the project-user identity - it is the “user” part of the project-user identity. In Hopsworks, a user-identity is mapped to a global Hopsworks role (independent of project membership) - a <strong>normal</strong> user or an <strong>administrator</strong>. A normal user can search for assets, update her profile, generate API keys, and change to/from projects. Administrators have access to user, project, storage, and application management pages, system monitoring and maintenance services. They can activate or block users, delete Projects, manage Project quotas, promote normal users to administrators, and so on. It’s important to mention here that a Hopsworks administrator <strong>cannot</strong> view the data&nbsp; inside a project - even if they are allowed to delete a project.<br></p><p>A user interacts with Hopsworks through the web application and they don’t necessarily realize that the web application is a facade to a modular distributed system. In the background we run <strong>HopsFS</strong> - our next-generation HDFS-on-S3 filesystem, <strong>HopsYARN</strong> - a cluster management system and scheduler, Apache Hive, Elasticsearch, (optionally Kafka and Airflow), and other logging and monitoring services.</p><p>A fundamental principle in every distributed system is that processes exchange messages over the network or through shared state (such as a filesystem or database). When communication is performed by message passing, it is imperative that we protect the messages from adversaries reading or modifying their content and validate the identity of the caller. Traditionally in Hadoop, they use Kerberos and GSSAPI to authenticate and authorize users and encrypt data in-transit. While Kerberos (Active Directory) is widely adopted by big organizations, the administration of users and services is a painful process and the system does not scale. On top of that Kerberos APIs are so complicated that <a href="https://apachebigdata2015.sched.com/event/3zv3/hadoop-and-kerberos-the-madness-beyond-the-gate-steve-loughran-hortonworks">programming against them can be really challenging</a>.</p><p>To avoid the pain of Kerberos (and be able to natively integrate with platforms like Kubernetes), we completely <a href="https://github.com/hopshadoop/hops">re-designed the security model for HopsFS and YARN to use certificates</a>. We replaced Kerberos with Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) with X.509 certificates to authenticate and authorize users. Certificates enabled us to also use the well established TLS protocol to provide confidentiality and data integrity. Every user and every service in a Hopsworks cluster has a private key and an X.509 certificate.</p><figure id="w-node-daa745592959-87a4da24"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f105955f5d5389cb463a175_Screenshot%202020-07-16%20at%2015.42.26.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>TLS-Based Multi-Tenant Services</h3><p>Hopsworks supports a number of stateful and compute services that use X.509 certificates to authenticate users, applications, and services: HopsFS, HiveServer2, Kafka, YARN. These services all provide their own authorization schemes. We unified HopsFS and Hive’s authorization models by providing 2-way TLS in HiveServer2 and <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Storage+Based+Authorization+in+the+Metastore+Server">storage based authorization for the Hive metastore</a>, that we <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/hive">ported to Hive 3.X</a>, to delegate access control decisions for Hive to HopsFS. In Hive, tables and databases store their data files inside directories on HopsFS, so HopsFS&nbsp; ACLs (access control lists) authorize file system operations by Hive (read from tables, write to tables). The easy-to-understand ACLs that we expose in Hopsworks (for Hive, and datasets in HopsFS) are captured in two roles: Data Scientists can read, Data Owners can read/write. HopsFS ACLs can be customized directly in Hopsworks from version 1.4.</p><p>For Kafka, we developed a <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/hops-kafka-authorizer">Hopsworks Authorizer plugin</a> that authorizes operations on Kafka topics by extracting the <em>project-user identity </em>from the client supplied X.509 certificate. The Hopsworks Kafka Authorizer then validates that the user is a member of the project that has permissions to perform the requested action on the Kafka topic.&nbsp;</p><p>HopsYARN uses X.509 certificates to identify users. HopsYARN also creates and manages (including renewal) application certificates for YARN applications (such as Spark jobs).

<tt>{philw,rob}@plan9.bell-labs.com</tt><h2>Abstract</h2>
Virtual machines are an important component of modern portable environments such as Inferno and Java because they provide an architecture-independent representation of executable code.  Their performance is critical to the success of such environments, but they are difficult to design well because they are subject to conflicting goals.  On the one hand, they offer a way to hide the differences between instruction architectures; on the other, they must be implemented efficiently on a variety of underlying machines.  A comparison of the engineering and evolution of the Inferno and Java virtual machines provides insight into the tradeoffs in their design and implementation.  We argue that the design of virtual machines should be rooted in the nature of modern processors, not language interpreters, with an eye towards on-the-fly compilation rather than interpretation or special-purpose silicon.<h2>Dis, the Inferno Virtual Machine</h2>
In early 1995, we set out to apply the ideas of the Plan 9 operating system [1] to a wider range of devices and networks.  The resulting system, Inferno [2], is a small operating system and execution environment that supports application portability across a wide variety of processors and operating systems.  Unaware of the contemporary work to establish Java [3] from the technology of the Oak project, we independently concluded that a virtual machine (VM) was a necessary component of such a system [4].  Because of improvements in processor speed and the feasibility of on-the-fly compilers, a VM can execute quickly enough to be economically viable.<p>
The Inferno virtual machine, called Dis, has several unusual aspects to its design: the instruction set, the module system, and the garbage collector.</p><p>
The Dis instruction set provides a close match to the architecture of existing processors.  Instructions are of the form</p><pre>	<i>OP    src1</i><tt>,</tt><i> src2</i><tt>,</tt><i> dst</i></pre><p>
The <i>src1</i> and <i>dst</i> operands specify general addresses or arbitrary-sized constants, while the <i>src2</i> operand is restricted to smaller constants and stack offsets to reduce code space.  Each operand specifies an address either in the stack frame of the executing procedure or in the global data of its module.</p><p>
The types of operands are set by the instructions.  Basic types are <tt>word</tt> (32-bit signed), <tt>big</tt> (64-bit signed), <tt>byte</tt> (8-bit unsigned), <tt>real</tt> (64-bit IEEE floating point), and pointer (implementation-dependent).  The instruction set follows the example of CISC processors, providing three-operand memory-to-memory operations for arithmetic, data motion, and so on.  It also has instructions to allocate memory, to load modules, and to create, synchronize, and communicate between processes.</p><p>
A module is the unit of dynamically loaded code and data.  Modules are loaded by a VM instruction that returns a pointer to a method table for the module.  That pointer is managed by the VM's garbage collector, so code and data for the module are garbage collected like any other memory.  Type safety is preserved by checking method types at module load time using an MD5 signature of the type.   </p><p>
Memory management is intimately tied to the instruction set of the VM.  Dis uses a hybrid garbage collection scheme: most garbage is collected by simple reference counting, while a real-time coloring collector gathers cyclic data.  Because reference counting is an exact rather than conservative form of garbage collection, the type of all data items must be known to the VM run-time system.  For this reason, the language-to-VM compiler generates a type descriptor for all compound types.  This descriptor reports the location of all pointers within the type, allowing the VM to track references as items are copied.</p><h2>Garbage collection</h2>
Memory dominates the cost of small systems, so the VM should be designed to keep memory usage as small as possible.  Through reference-counted garbage collection, Dis reclaims memory the moment it becomes unused.  Reference counting also eliminates the need for a large arena as required for efficient mark-and-sweep collection.  Both these results reduce the memory requirements of the VM and its applications.<p>
Compare this to the Java VM, whose instruction set makes it difficult to track references as objects are copied.  This biases against reference counting, so JVM implementations choose lazier techniques such as mark-and-sweep, inducing a larger arena and delayed collection, both of which increase the memory use and therefore the cost of the overall system.</p><h2>Issues in compiling</h2>
It is easy to interpret the individual instructions of a stack-based virtual machine (SM) such as the Java virtual machine (JVM), because most operands are implicit.  However, a high-level language implementation of the interpreter generates more memory traffic than the equivalent set of instructions in a memory transfer machine (MM) such as Dis.  Consider the code to execute<pre>	<tt>c = a + b;</tt></pre><p>
An SM would execute this by a code burst such as this, which we have annotated with its memory traffic using L for load and S for store:</p><pre>	<tt>push  a      # </tt>LS<tt>
	push  b      # </tt>LS<tt>
	add          # </tt>LLS<tt>
	store c      # </tt>LS</pre><p>
The corresponding MM code burst would be the plain three-operand instruction</p><pre>	<tt>add   a,b,c  # </tt>LLS</pre><p>
When interpreting, the extra memory traffic of the SM is masked by the time saved by not decoding any operand fields.   The operand fields are implicit in the SM instructions, while the MM they are explicit: three operand fields must be decoded in every instruction, even those without operands.</p><p>
When compiling, the tradeoffs are different.  Clearly, either design can produce the same native instructions from its just-in-time compiler (JIT), but in the SM case most of the work must be done in the JIT, whereas in the MM design the front end has done most of the work and the JIT can be substantially simpler and faster.</p><p>
A JIT for an SM is forced to do most of the work of register allocation in the JIT itself.  Because the types of stack cells change as the program executes, the JIT must track their types as it compiles.  In an MM, however, the architecture maps well to native instructions.  This produces a continuum of register allocation strategies from none, to simple mapping of known cells to registers, to flow-based register allocation.  Most of the work of any of these strategies can be done in the language-to-VM compiler.  It can generate code for an infinite-register machine, and the JIT can then allocate as many as are available in the native architecture.  Again, this distribution of work keeps the JIT simple.  </p><h2>Processors</h2>
The same issues that face the JIT writer also face the designer of special-purpose processors to support a VM.  Register allocation in the JIT is analogous to register relabeling in silicon, and an SM design adds unnecessary complexity to an already difficult problem.  One might argue that a stack-based processor design would mitigate the difficulties, but our experience with the implementation of a stack machine in the AT&amp;T Crisp microprocessor [5] leads us to believe that stack architectures are inherently slower than register-based machines.  Their design lengthens the critical path by replacing simple registers with a complex stack cache mechanism.<p>
In other words, it is a better idea to match the design of the VM to the processor than the other way around.</p><p>
Dis fits this criterion better, but we do not plan to implement Dis in silicon.  The idea of a VM is to be architecture-independent; offering a special processor to run it negates the original goal by favoring one instruction set.  Ignoring that for the moment, though, there could still be two reasons to consider designing silicon for Dis: performance and cost.</p><p>
On performance, history shows that language-specific CPUs are not competitive.  The investment in the special design takes energy away from the systems issues that ultimately dominate performance.   Performance gains realized through language-specific support tend to be offset by parallel improvements in general-purpose processors during the life cycle of the CPU.</p><p>
Dis compiles quickly into native code that runs only 30-50% slower than native C.  At the current rate of processor improvement, that is only a few months of processor design time.  It is wiser to focus on improving execution on commodity, general purpose processors than on inventing a new architecture.</p><p>
The issue of cost is more subtle.  Dis is close enough to familiar architectures that a special chip with high integration of systems facilities could be cost-effective on small platforms.  The real reason for that, though, is that the memory management design of the virtual machine makes it easy to implement Dis in small memory.  By contrast, whatever cost gains an integrated Java processor might realize will likely be lost in the extra memory required by its conservative garbage collection scheme [6].</p><h2>References</h2>

      <article role="main">
        <p>Welcome to the second post from my collaboration with <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismattman">@chrismattman</a>.  We
were both intrigued when Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/search-language-understanding-bert/">announced</a> a significant upgrade to their search algorithm in late 2019.  The technique
is super cool, inspired by the human brain, redefining how we search
for text, images, music, and more.</p>

<p>Here’s one example from Google’s post. Let’s say we’re wondering whether we can pick up medicine
for a friend, who may be sick and cannot enter a pharmacy due to Covid19
restrictions.  We Google it:</p>

<p><img alt="Dope" src="https://scott.ai/img/dope_image5.jpg"></p>

<p>Before this upgrade, Google would show us information about prescriptions on the
left.  Old Google would see high overlap between our keywords “get, pharmacy,
medicine” and the top blog post.  Statistically, these keywords are the meaty,
distinguishing topic of our inquiry.  The rest of the words are quite common,
such as “can, you,” and “for”.   Articles that only include those wouldn’t do us
much good.  Google would seek keyword overlap, finding the most authoritative
and relevant answer.  This is how search has worked for decades, which we call
syntactic search, based on the written syntax of human language.</p>

<p>The new Google thinks differently.  The new Google thinks like Bert with
tensors, as described in our previous blog post.  Here Google understands that
“can, for, someone” are key to our intent, even though the common words of “for”
and “someone” seem to carry little information by themselves.  These words,
along with the major keywords of “get, pharmacy, medicine” better define our
intent, encoded as a tensor.  Sure enough, today’s new Google finds a better
article on the right.  Note that the article talks of “prescription” when we
stated “medicine,” though these are clearly related, even though they don’t
match.  This new approach is called semantic search and it’s here and widely
available and easily implemented because of Bert.</p>

<p>Semantic search is cool.  It’s all the rage in the scientific community.  We
have high hopes that this tensor technique will allow us to better search
through our overfull inboxes, that pile of PDFs waiting to be read, or the
thousands of customer comments we’d like to process.</p>

<h3 id="how-it-works">How it Works</h3>

<p>Semantic search is a three-step process.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Encode content as tensors</li>
  <li>Encode a query as a tensor</li>
  <li>Find tensors that match</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="encoding-content">Encoding content</h3>

<p>We need a tool for turning content into tensors in <em>bulk</em>.  Currently this remains
the realm of research, though we suspect this capability will soon be
commercially available.   Please, are you listening, product people?   Bueller?
Has anyone seen Bueller?</p>

<p>We have two current favorites, one for scale, one for play.</p>

<h3 id="bert-as-a-service-for-scale">Bert as a Service, for scale.</h3>

<p>Han Xiao (<a href="https://twitter.com/hxiao0">@hxiao</a>) released an open source package in 2019 which takes the
latest, published version of Bert and encapsulates it in a web service.  Han was
recently a CTO at TenCent, now building a promising new company
(<a href="https://jina.ai/">Jina.ai</a>) for semantic search.</p>

<p>Han applied hardcore, distributed systems engineering and optimizations which
allows us to turn 256 sentence fragments into embeddings with a single call,
automatically and elegantly handled by a powerful cluster of energy-chomping,
GPU-enhanced, computational beasts.  We extended his code to run Bert on Google
Cloud in a public <a href="https://github.com/scottspace/bert-as-service">Github repository</a>; 
feel free to use it!</p>

<p>We use Bert as a Service in our applied AI work at Google and NASA, as it scales
nicely to handle millions of sentences.   If you’ve ever written a function in
Microsoft Excel, say, for taking the <code>@sum()</code> of a column, you now have what it
takes to use Bert!</p>

<p>Thanks to Bert as a Service, here’s how we turn three sentences about “apples”
into tensors:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>apple1 = bertify("Apple shares rose on the news.") 
apple2 = bertify("Apple sold fewer iPhones this quarter.") 
apple3 = bertify("Apple pie is delicious.")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The values “apple1, apple2,” and “apple3” are 768-dimensional vectors
representing the BERT tensors.  We can execute these in parallel too, up to 256
at a time.  These are sent to a cloud service that can use your own, private
cluster of high-end, GPU-stuffed machines:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>apples = bertify(["Apple shares rose on the news.",
                "Apple sold fewer iPhones this quarter.",
                 "Apple pie is delicious."])
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="spacy-for-play">Spacy, for play.</h3>

<p>Ines Montani (<a href="https://twitter.com/inesmontani">@_inesmontani</a>) and her co-founder started
<a href="https://twitter.com/explosion_ai">explosion.ai</a> in 2016 to
make tools for processing human language.  This kick-ass AI leader and her tiny
German company are having an outsized impact by focusing on simple, easy to use
tools that have immediate, practical value.  They contribute some of  their best
work to open source, as part of the “<a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy</a>” toolset.</p>

<p>Spacy provides tools for running Bert on your own, personal machine.  With 2-3
lines of code, you can be up and running:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>!pip -q install -U spacy download spacy-transformers 
!pip -q install -U en_trf_bertbaseuncased_lg

import spacy 
import en_trf_bertbaseuncased_lg

nlp = en_trf_bertbaseuncased_lg.load() 
apple1 = nlp("Apple shares rose on the news.") 
apple2 = nlp("Apple sold fewer iPhones this quarter.") 
apple3 = nlp("Apple pie is delicious.")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The values “apple1, apple2,” and “apple3” are objects where you can directly
access their BERT .tensor values.  We find this helpful in our personal and
exploratory research, where encoding a few thousand sentences is sufficient.
Again, it’s no more difficult than a one-line script in Excel!</p>

<p>We realize there are numerous other packages and research papers on how to use
Bert and its derivatives.  We like things simple and believe that’s the way
forward for mere mortals and also for your favorite blog authors trying to get
out a blog every few weeks.  If you’re not mentioned here, it’s because we find
it too hard to use or, frankly, are naively unaware.  Please keep pushing and
sharing!  The world needs your contributions to make AI simpler for all.</p>

<p>Our projects use these one-line interfaces to turn large quantities of raw text
into large quantities of tensors.  For now, we store these tensors and their
original text in cloud databases such as BigQuery or cloud storage such as GCS.
Absent those excellent databases, Pandas also works fine locally.</p>

<p>What we really want is a tensor store, optimized for storing, searching and
retrieving billions of high-dimensional tensors.  <a href="http://featurestore.org/">Feature stores</a> are a step in
the right direction, though they’re optimized for smaller vector sizes from
hand-built statistical features.  True tensor stores don’t yet exist.</p>

<h3 id="encoding-query">Encoding query</h3>

<p>The simplest approach encodes our query with a single call, as shown above.
This yields a single, 768-dimensional tensor to represent our search phrase.</p>

<p>In Spacy,</p>

<div><div><pre><code>query = nlp("Can you get medicine for someone pharmacy")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Bert as a Service,</p>

<div><div><pre><code>query = bertify("Can you get medicine for someone pharmacy")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Sophisticated, production systems like Google extend our initial query with
similar words to account for mis-spellings, synonyms, and omissions. This
produces not one but a set of tensors to represent our search.  One shot becomes
buckshot.  Throw more at the wall and see what sticks. Yes, even AI uses
techniques from the era of cave dwellers and knuckle draggers.</p>

<h3 id="finding-tensors-that-match">Finding tensors that match</h3>

<p>Remember the neural science that inspired Bert?  We humans encode language in
the brain’s neocortex, a three-dimensional space.  MRI scans revealed that
similar language terms (such as “medical” and “pharmacy”) often land on the same
3D spots of the brain.  Thus, when we ask you for the first word that comes to
mind in a matching game, chances are you’re using the same part of your brain!</p>

<p><img alt="Dope" width="400" src="https://scott.ai/img/dope_image4.gif"></p>

<p>Tensors encode language in a space, too.  Computers aren’t limited to 3D; the
Bert algorithm reasons in a 768-D space.  Similar concepts are stored close
together, much like the neocortex.  We want our search engine to show us the
exact match, if it exists, followed by closely related text.</p>

<p>Here’s a plot taken from Bert answering a query, simplified to 3D.  Our query’s
the pale blue dot.  The closest tensors in the tensor universe are displayed in
colors, varying in intensity based on distance to our blue query.  This is how
Bert searches, as well as how NASA searches for exoplanets and extraterrestrial
life (<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/artificial-intelligence-nasa-data-used-to-discover-eighth-planet-circling-distant-star/">true story</a>!).</p>

<p><img alt="Dope" width="400" src="https://scott.ai/img/dope_image8.png"></p>

<p>Computer scientists call this the nearest neighbor problem.</p>

<p>Given an input tensor T<sub>0</sub>, find the k nearest, neighboring tensors from a larger
set of tensors T.  T<sub>0</sub> is blue in the figure above, along with the 1000 closest
tensors (k=1000).  “Nearest” is defined as the shortest line you could draw –
in 768D – from one tensor to another.   There’s a bit of math involved to
calculate this distance, often taking a dozen instructions on a modern computer.
That normally wouldn’t be bad, except for scale and impatience.</p>

<p>The set T of tensors is often massive, on the order of billions of tensors for a
typical enterprise, trillions for the Internet.  Imagine encoding all social
media posts, or all documents in your enterprise, all email words and sentences.
Please stay away from Chris’s posts because that’s scale. We mean nearly 43K
posts of scale:</p>

<p><img alt="Dope" width="400" src="https://scott.ai/img/dope_image12.png"></p>

<p>Impatience is about the speed of business.  We’re accustomed to Google searches
returning in under a second, from billions of web pages.  We expect and want the
same from semantic search.  This is impatience.</p>

<p>Comparing the distance from our query to every tensor could take minutes on
modern distributed computers.  This ensures perfect recall but seemingly takes
forever in a world expecting instant results.</p>

<p><img alt="Dope" width="400" src="https://scott.ai/img/dope_image6.jpg"></p>

<p>You’re probably scowling right now, as Claude Shannon was in this cropped photo
from Wikipedia.  Claude was the father of modern <em>information theory</em> which became
the mathematical backbone to cracking cryptographic codes in World Wars, to
building the first computers, to deploying the first cell phones, and more
recently to developing the first vaccines for Covid19.</p>

<p>Claude formalized the idea of a “bit” of information, the smallest glimmer of
information we can understand from any source.   These bits were …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<p>Clojure is one of the most interesting new languages targeting the JVM. Initially only the JVM, in the meantime it is also available for JavaScript. Essentially, you can write Clojure and either execute it as Java program or JavaScript program, of course each flavor has its unique features as well.</p>

<p>Clojure is a Lisp, thus the syntax may be foreign, but it is really, really easy since there are very few syntactic variations. The language “Lisp” is very lean and usually easily learned.</p>

<p>In this post, we’re going to create a complete REST application from scratch. There are already some (very) good tutorials available, but some are not quite up to date (see <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/clojure-web-application">Heroku’s Devcenter</a> or Mark McGranaghan for good ones). Clojure itself is still a young language, Lisp of course has a lot of history.</p>

<p>Our application should allow creating, listing, fetching, updating, and deleting of documents.</p>

<p>A document looks like this (JSON encoded):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
      <span>"id"</span> : <span>"some id"</span>,
      <span>"title"</span> : <span>"some title"</span>
      <span>"text"</span> : <span>"some text"</span>
}</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>A GET call to /documents should return a list of these documents.</li>
<li>A POST call to /documents with a documents as body shall create a new document, assigning a new id (ignoreing the posted one).</li>
<li>A GET to /documents/[ID] should return the document with the given id, or 404 if the document does not exist.</li>
<li>A PUT to /documents/[ID] should update the document with the given id and replace title and text with those from the document in the uploaded body.</li>
<li>A DELETE to /documents/[ID] should delete the document with the given id and return 204 (NO CONTENT) in any case.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="creating-the-project-scaffolding">Creating the project scaffolding</h2>

<p>We’re going to use <a href="https://leiningen.org/">Leiningen</a>, the defacto build system and dependency manager for Clojure projects. Download and install it, then execute:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">lein new compojure clojure-rest</code></pre></div>
<p>We’re creating a new <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/compojure/wiki">Compojure</a> project called clojure-rest. Compojure is the library that maps URLs to functions in our program. Compojure (and our project) builds on Ring is the basic Server API. To start the new project run:</p>

<p>This starts the server on localhost:3000 and automatically restarts the server if any of the project files change. Thus, you can leave it running while we develop our application.</p>

<p>The <code>new</code> command generates two very important files for us:</p>

<p><code>project.clj</code> is the project configuration. It states dependencies, the entry point etc. (read the whole documentation on <a href="https://leiningen.org/">Leiningen.org</a>, and <code>src/clojure_rest/handler.clj</code> which contains a starting point for our application.</p>

<h2 id="project-configuration-project-clj">Project configuration (project.clj)</h2>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>defproject </span>clojure-rest <span>"0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"</span>
      <span>:description</span> <span>"FIXME: write description"</span>
      <span>:url</span> <span>"http://example.com/FIXME"</span>

                     [compojure <span>"1.1.1"</span>]]

      <span>:profiles</span>
      {<span>:dev</span> {<span>:dependencies</span> [[ring-mock <span>"0.1.3"</span>]]}})
Update the file to look like this<span>:</span>

(<span>defproject </span>clojure-rest <span>"0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"</span>
      <span>:description</span> <span>"REST service for documents"</span>
      <span>:url</span> <span>"https://tutswiki.com"</span>
      <span>:dependencies</span> [[org.clojure/clojure <span>"1.4.0"</span>]
                     [compojure <span>"1.1.1"</span>]
                     [ring/ring-json <span>"0.1.2"</span>]
                     [c3p0/c3p0 <span>"0.9.1.2"</span>]
                     [org.clojure/java.jdbc <span>"0.2.3"</span>]
                     [com.h2database/h2 <span>"1.3.168"</span>]
                     [cheshire <span>"4.0.3"</span>]]
      <span>:plugins</span> [[lein-ring <span>"0.7.3"</span>]]
      <span>:ring</span> {<span>:handler</span> clojure-rest.handler/app}
      <span>:profiles</span>
      {<span>:dev</span> {<span>:dependencies</span> [[ring-mock <span>"0.1.3"</span>]]}})</code></pre></div>
<p>Besides the JSON parsing library <a href="https://github.com/dakrone/cheshire">Cheshire</a>, we added the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/c3p0/">C3P0 Connection Pool</a>, the <a href="https://h2database.com/">H2 Database</a> JDBC driver and Clojure’s <a href="https://github.com/clojure/java.jdbc">java.jdbc</a> contrib-library.</p>

<p>I also updated the <code>:url</code> and <code>:description</code> fields.</p>

<h2 id="the-request-handler-handler-clj">The request handler (handler.clj)</h2>

<p>Next let’s have a look at the generated request handler <code>src/clojure_rest/handler.clj</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>ns </span>clojure-rest.handler
      (<span>:use</span> compojure.core)
      (<span>:require</span> [compojure.handler <span>:as</span> handler]
                [compojure.route <span>:as</span> route]))

    (<span>defroutes</span> app-routes
      (<span>GET</span> <span>"/"</span> [] <span>"Hello World"</span>)
      (<span>route/not-found</span> <span>"Not Found"</span>))

    (<span>def </span>app
      (<span>handler/site</span> app-routes))</code></pre></div>
<p>The route <code>GET "/" [] "Hello World"</code> is responsible for our result we saw in the browser. It maps all GET requests to / without parameters to “Hello World”. The (<code>def app (handler/site app-routes)</code>) part configures our application (registering the routes).</p>

<p>Our first step is to update the configuration. We’re going to work with JSON, so let’s include some Ring middlewares to setup response headers (wrap-json-response) and parse request bodies (<code>wrap-json-body</code>) for us. A middleware is just a wrapper around a handler, thus it can pre- and post-process the whole request/response cycle.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>def </span>app
      (-&gt; (<span>handler/api</span> app-routes)
        (<span>middleware/wrap-json-body</span>)
        (<span>middleware/wrap-json-response</span>)))</code></pre></div>
<p>We switched also from the <code>handler/site</code> template to <code>handler/api</code> which is more appropriate for REST APIs (<a href="https://weavejester.github.com/compojure/compojure.handler.html">documentation</a>).</p>

<p>Next let’s define the routes for our application:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>defroutes</span> app-routes
      (<span>context</span> <span>"/documents"</span> [] (<span>defroutes</span> documents-routes
        (<span>GET</span>  <span>"/"</span> [] (<span>get-all-documents</span>))
        (<span>POST</span> <span>"/"</span> {body <span>:body</span>} (<span>create-new-document</span> body))
        (<span>context</span> <span>"/:id"</span> [id] (<span>defroutes</span> document-routes
          (<span>GET</span>    <span>"/"</span> [] (<span>get-document</span> id))
          (<span>PUT</span>    <span>"/"</span> {body <span>:body</span>} (<span>update-document</span> id body))
          (<span>DELETE</span> <span>"/"</span> [] (<span>delete-document</span> id))))))
      (<span>route/not-found</span> <span>"Not Found"</span>))</code></pre></div>
<p>We define GET and POST for the context “/documents, and GET, PUT, DELETE for the context “:id” on top of that. :id is a placeholder and can then be injected into our parameter vector. The POST and PUT request have a special parameter body for the parsed body (this parameter is provided by the wrap-json-body middleware. For more on routes, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/compojure/wiki/Routes-In-Detail">Compojure’s documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Before we define the functions to carry out the requests, let’s fix the imports and open a pool of database connections to work with.</p>

<p>The namespace declaration is used to define which namespaces shall be made available by Clojure.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>ns </span>clojure-rest.handler
      (<span>:import</span> com.mchange.v2.c3p0.ComboPooledDataSource)
      (<span>:use</span> compojure.core)
      (<span>:use</span> cheshire.core)
      (<span>:use</span> ring.util.response)
      (<span>:require</span> [compojure.handler <span>:as</span> handler]
                [ring.middleware.json <span>:as</span> middleware]
                [clojure.java.jdbc <span>:as</span> sql]
                [compojure.route <span>:as</span> route]))</code></pre></div>
<p>We import C3P0’s <code>ComboPooledDataSource</code>, a plain Java class. Next, we fetch the functions defined in <code>compojure.core</code>, <code>cheshire.core</code>, and <code>ring.util.response</code> into our namespace, they can be used without qualifying. Finally we require some more libraries, this time with a qualifier to prevent name clashes or to support nicer separation. I’m not sure when to make the cut between <code>:use</code> and <code>:require</code> yet, so the cut is abitrary.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>def </span>db-config
      {<span>:classname</span> <span>"org.h2.Driver"</span>
       <span>:subprotocol</span> <span>"h2"</span>
       <span>:subname</span> <span>"mem:documents"</span>
       <span>:user</span> <span>""</span>
       <span>:password</span> <span>""</span>})</code></pre></div>
<p>Note, we use a in-memory database. If you’d like to keep your database between restarts, you could use <code>:subname "/tmp/documents"</code> for example.</p>

<p>Next we open a pool of connections. C3P0 has no Clojure wrapper, so we deal with Java classes and objects directly (hence a bit more code).</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>defn </span>pool
      [config]
      (<span>let </span>[cpds (doto (<span>ComboPooledDataSource.</span>)
                   (<span>.setDriverClass</span> (<span>:classname</span> config))
                   (<span>.setJdbcUrl</span> (str <span>"jdbc:"</span> (<span>:subprotocol</span> config) <span>":"</span> (<span>:subname</span> config)))
                   (<span>.setUser</span> (<span>:user</span> config))
                   (<span>.setPassword</span> (<span>:password</span> config))
                   (<span>.setMaxPoolSize</span> <span>6</span>)
                   (<span>.setMinPoolSize</span> <span>1</span>)
                   (<span>.setInitialPoolSize</span> <span>1</span>))]
        {<span>:datasource</span> cpds}))

    (<span>def </span>pooled-db (<span>delay</span> (<span>pool</span> db-config)))

    (<span>defn </span>db-connection [] <span>@</span>pooled-db)</code></pre></div>
<p>Since we deal with a in-memory database, we need to create our table now.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>sql/with-connection</span> (<span>db-connection</span>)
      (<span>sql/create-table</span> <span>:documents</span> [<span>:id</span> <span>"varchar(256)"</span> <span>"primary key"</span>]
                                   [<span>:title</span> <span>"varchar(1024)"</span>]
                                   [<span>:text</span> <span>:varchar</span>]))</code></pre></div>
<p>The intent should be easy to understand, for the details take a look at the <a href="https://clojure.github.com/java.jdbc/">java.jdbc documentation</a>. We create a table documents with a :id, :title, and :text column. Note that the database column is called id, not :id.</p>

<p>The only thing missing are the functions to actually perform the actions requested by our clients.</p>

<p>To return a single document with a given id, we could come up with this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>defn </span>get-document [id]
      (<span>sql/with-connection</span> (<span>db-connection</span>)
        (<span>sql/with-query-results</span> results
          [<span>"select * from documents where id = ?"</span> id]
          (<span>cond</span>
            (<span>empty?</span> results) {<span>:status</span> <span>404</span>}
            <span>:else</span> (<span>response</span> (first results))))))</code></pre></div>
<p>It reads like this: when called with an id, open a database connection, perform <code>select * from documents where id = ?</code> with the given id as parameter. If the result is empty, return 404, otherwise return the first (and only) document as response.</p>

<p>The response call will convert the document into JSON, this functionality is provided by wrap-json-response, which also sets the correct Content-Type etc.</p>

<p>Another nice one is the creation of new documents:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>defn </span>uuid [] (str (<span>java.util.UUID/randomUUID</span>)))

    (<span>defn </span>create-new-document [doc]
      (<span>let </span>[id (<span>uuid</span>)]
        (<span>sql/with-connection</span> (<span>db-connection</span>)
          (<span>let </span>[document (assoc doc <span>"id"</span> id)]
            (<span>sql/insert-record</span> <span>:documents</span> document)))
        (<span>get-document</span> id)))</code></pre></div>
<p>Here we use Java’s UUID generator (without import, hence the full package name) to generate a new id for each document created. The second let statement is responsible to replace the user-provided id (if any) with our generated one. Remember that Clojure’s datastructures are immutable, so we need to use the document variable thereafter, instead of the doc which still contains the old (or no) id.</p>

	<p><small>July 20, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Many languages start running your program by calling a function of
yours that must have a specific name. In C (and many C derived
languages), this is just called <code>main()</code>; in Go, it's <code>main.main()</code>
(the <code>main()</code> function in the <code>main</code> package). Python famously
doesn't require any such function, and won't automatically call a
function called <code>main()</code> even if you create it. Recently I read
<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/why-doesnt-python-have-a-main-function-3afe6a8d093">Why doesnâ€™t Python have a main function?</a>
(<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/fumh1r/why_doesn_t_python_have_main_function">via</a>),
which puts forward one discussion for why this is so. However, I have
a somewhat different way of explaining this situation.</p>

<p>The core reason that Python doesn't require a <code>main()</code> function is a
combination of its execution model (specifically for what happens when
you import something) and that under normal circumstances you start
Python programs by (implicitly) importing a single file of Python code.
So let's look at each of these parts.</p>

<p>In many languages things like functions, classes, and so on are
created (defined) by the interpreter or compiler as it parses the
source file. In Python, this is not quite the case; instead, <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/FunctionDefinitionOrder"><code>def</code>
and <code>class</code> are executable statements</a>,
and they define classes and functions when they execute (among other
things, this is part of <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/WhyMetaclassesWork">why metaclasses work</a>).
When Python imports something, it simply executes everything in the
file (or the import more generally). When what's executed is <code>def</code>
and <code>class</code> statements, you get functions and classes. When what's
executed is regular code, you get more complicated things happening,
including conditional imports or calling functions on the fly under
the right conditions. Or you can write an entire program that just
runs inline, as the file is imported.</p>

<p>(This has some interesting consequences, including <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/ReloadRealBehavior">what reloading
a Python module really does</a>.)</p>

<p>However, Python is not quite as unique here as it might look. Many
languages have some facility to run arbitrary code early on as the
program is 'loading', before the program starts normal execution
(Go has <code>init()</code> functions, for example). Where Python is different
from these languages is that Python normally starts a program by
loading and executing a specific single file. Because Python is
only executing a single file, it's unambiguous what code is run in
what order and it's straightforward for the code in that file to
control what happens. In a sense, rather than picking an arbitrarily
named function for where execution (nominally) starts, Python is
able to sneakily pick an arbitrarily named file by having you provide
it.</p>

<p>(Compiled languages traditionally have a model where code from a bunch
of separate files is all sort of piled up together. In Python, you can't
really aggregate multiple files together into a shared namespace this
way; one way or another, you have to <code>import</code> them and everything starts
from some initial file.)</p>

<p>Where this nice model breaks down and needs a workaround is if you
run a package with '<code>python -m ...</code>', where Python doesn't really
have a single file that you're executing (or it'd have to make
<code>__init__.py</code> serve double duty). As covered in the official
documentation's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html"><code>__main__</code> â€” Top-level script environment</a> (<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/fumh1r/why_doesn_t_python_have_main_function#c_jmer2v">via</a>),
Python adopts the arbitrary convention of loading a <code>__main__.py</code>
file from your package and declaring it more or less the point where
execution starts.</p>

<p>(Under at least some situations, your package's <code>__init__.py</code> may
also be executed.)</p>

<p>PS: contrary to <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/why-doesnt-python-have-a-main-function-3afe6a8d093">the original article's views</a>,
<strong>I strongly suggest that you have a <code>main()</code> function</strong>, because
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/ImportableMain">there are significant benefits to keeping your program importable</a>.</p>

This is a post I've been meaning to write for a while now: one anecdotally
comparing programming languages in the Lisp family. I consider myself to be a
Lisp hacker. Perhaps that much was obvious from the letter λ adorning my
website's header, a reference to the λ-calculus which inspired John McCarthy to
design the first LISP [1]. Yet, "Lisp hacker" likely means little unless you,
too, consider yourself to be a Lisp hacker. Calling yourself one seems carry
some level of unstated meaning. Indeed, some identify with more specific groups.
"Schemer," or "Guiler," or "Racketeer," or "Clojurist." But "Lisp Hackers" ⊇
"Schemers". There is commonality shared among all, or at least most, of these
programming languages, and the Lisp hackers recognize and appreciate that
commonality – the characteristics that make a programming language a Lisp.
Homoiconic syntax, powerful metaprogramming facilities, and editor support that,
in my opinion, is unparalleled. (Yes, I am alluding to GNU Emacs.) This article,
however, is concerned with the differences. In it, I will be considering the
specifics of each dialect, and whether or not those specifics make for a
language I would want to use to develop a new piece of software.
</p><p>
I'm specifically concerned with game development at the time of writing this
article. An idea for a turn-based tactics game came to me and I felt a Lisp
would be the best tool for realizing it, but the decision to use "a Lisp" still
leaves me with several choices. When I enumerate the notable design choices
behind each dialect, and talk about the approaches I prefer, my opinions will
be, in some capacity, framed as partial answers to the question of "will I be
able to comfortably use this to write a video game?" As such, there are a few
things I am specifically interested in:
</p><ul>
<li><b>Ergonomics</b>, or "a measure of the friction [one experiences] when trying to get
things done" [2].</li>
<li><b>Expressiveness</b>, or the ease with which code may be understood by a reader.</li>
<li><b>Performance</b>, which is nontrivial to properly quantify [3]. I won't be rigorous
with this; a one-off run with <code>time</code> can give a good idea of the order of
magnitude for execution time.</li>
<li><b>Ease of distribution</b>, which is difficult to define, but with which I associate
platform agnosticism, a runtime that won't bloat my tarballs by several
gigabytes, and a lack of baroque and difficult to obtain dependencies.</li>
<li><b>Ability to interface with other libraries</b>, as I'll want to be able to
draw to the screen, and play sounds, and so on.</li>
</ul><p>
For each dialect, I'm allowing myself to use nonstandard functions. I'm aiming
for an evaluation of the practical aspects of each language, and if you were
writing software, you'd likely be using more than what's included in the R5RS or
ANSI CL standards. Though, if these nonstandard functions are specific to a
single implementation, I will avoid them. SRFI's and QuickLisp are fair game,
but CHICKEN's Eggs are not. Ah, I'm already getting ahead of myself. Yes, I will
be comparing Scheme and Common Lisp. I almost have to – the history of Lisp
tends to be spun as a schism between Common Lisp and Scheme. I will be speaking
of a few others as well. I've mostly chosen dialects for which there exists some
"game engine" type library. For R7RS (CHICKEN), there is <a href="http://alex-charlton.com/projects/Hypergiant/">Hypergiant</a>, for R6RS
(Guile) there is <a href="https://dthompson.us/projects/chickadee.html">Chickadee</a>, for Common Lisp there is <a href="http://www.xelf.me/">Xelf</a>, and for Fennel there
is, of course, <a href="https://love2d.org/">LÖVE</a>.

<figcaption><span>Figure 1: </span>My take on the drawing in Conrad Barski's <i>Land of Lisp</i>. From left to right: Common Lisp, Scheme, <del>Haskell</del> Fennel.</figcaption>
</figure><p>
What follows are my opinions, so I'd like to lead with the background that
motivated them. My earliest "serious" experience with Lisp was with Peter
Seibel's <i>Practical Common Lisp</i>, which I picked up in high school following a
failed attempt at reading <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs</i>.<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> The portion of the latter book that I did manage was enough to
convince me that learning <span>a</span> Lisp would be valuable, but that learning Common
Lisp may be more tractable than learning Scheme. The summer following my first
year of university, I taught myself Scheme to do <a href="http://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">GSoC</a> for <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">GNU Guix</a>. Guile
quickly grew on me, and I soon began <a href="http://jakob.space/blog/transition-to-haunt.html">using Haunt</a> for my personal website. I've
been unknowingly using Emacs Lisp since much earlier – not in the sense of
writing packages – my old man taught me how to use Emacs when I was nine, but I
was <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Easy-Customization.html">mostly shielded from having to write <code>setq</code> forms</a>. I've also used <a href="https://docs.hylang.org/en/stable/">Hy</a>, <a href="https://fennel-lang.org/">Fennel</a>,
… well, I'm wildly off track now. Point being, I've used many Lisps, and I've
subconsciously acknowledged the differences between them, but never turned that
acknowledgment into coherent thought.
</p><p>
To aid in the comparison, I've written the same raytracer in several dialects of
Lisp. My reasons for choosing a raytracer are that:
</p><ul>
<li>I'm reasonably familiar with how they work.</li>
<li>Performance matters, and differences in performance is noticeable.</li>
<li>It's nontrivial, but several implementations of a raytracer is also more
tractable than, say, several implementations of a high-performance database.</li>
</ul><p>
Another consideration was the number of advancements in raytracing that build
upon the same basic structure, potentially giving me a way to compare the ease
with which a change to a system can be made, but writing these raytracers took
enough out of me that I didn't want to play with them any more.
</p><p>
This was not nearly as telling of a comparison as I had hoped. Once I'd
completed the first raytracer, everything that followed had the same structure.
Regardless, writing these raytracers gave me an idea of the characteristics I
was interested in, especially performance. For anyone who would like to look at
the code, the implementations are available <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~jakob/lisp-raytracer-zoo">here</a>.

<p>
Well, if we're writing a raytracer, then, we had better have some way of seeing
the results. The issue is portability. Ideally, I'd like to be able to run the
raytacers on different implementations of each language, but none of them have
standardized support for drawing graphics. An idea I had was to render the image
to the terminal using ANSI escape sequences, but I thought the resulting images
would be quite shitty. Instead, I decided to go the <a href="https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki/Lesson-0-getting-started">route that tinyrenderer
takes</a>, which is to output to an image file. Initially, the image format I went
with was the venerable PNG. This was a mistake. Even if it did lead to a rather
elegant CRC procedure in Scheme.
</p>

<div>
<pre>(<span>define</span> (<span>chunk-crc</span> bytes)
  (<span>define</span> (<span>process-byte</span> crc byte)
    (bitwise-xor (vector-ref png-crc (bitwise-and #xff (bitwise-xor crc byte)))
                 (arithmetic-shift crc -8)))
  (reduce process-byte bytes #xffffffff))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Realizing PNG was needlessly complex, I went on to write a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~jakob/lisp-raytracer-zoo/tree/master/write-bmp.scm">BMP encoder</a>, which
was fine until I came across <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2017/11/03/">an article</a> from Chris Wellons about rendering video
with C by encoding frames as <a href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/">Netpbm</a> images. I decided to scrap my BMP encoder
and go with PPM instead. Netpbm is text-based: the issue with a PNG or BMP
encoder in Scheme, for example, is that you're dealing with a binary format.
Glancing over the standards now, it seems there are, indeed, standardized
procedures for dealing with binary data in both R6RS and R7RS. Regardless,
dealing with those binary structures and having to consider endianness is a
pain. PPM is <span>dead</span> simple. In fact, I'd wager that if all you had access to were
the examples on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm">Wikipedia</a> page, you'd be able to write an encoder. Here's
the Scheme implementation:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(<span>define</span> (<span>write-ppm</span> width height pixels)
  <span>"Encode the WIDTH by HEIGHT image given as PIXELS into the portable pixmap</span>
<span>format (PPM), writing the result to `(current-output-port)'."</span>
  (<span>define</span> (<span>delimit-values</span> values)
    (<span>cond</span> ((null? values)
           (newline))
          ((= 1 (length values))
           (display (car values))
           (delimit-values (cdr values)))
          (<span>else</span>
           (display (car values))
           (display <span>" "</span>)
           (delimit-values (cdr values)))))

  
  (delimit-values '(<span>"P3"</span>))

  
  (delimit-values (list width height))

  
  (delimit-values '(<span>"255"</span>))

  
  (<span>for-each</span> delimit-values (vector-&gt;list pixels)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you do away with my nice formatting, that's twelve lines of code, all of
which are R5RS-compatible. We have access to the Netpbm suite, too, so if we
want a PNG, we can always <code>./write-ppm | pnmtopng &gt; test.png</code>. Netpbm is a
real hidden gem. Well, hidden to me, at least.

If you aren't familiar with Scheme, it has somewhat of a self-imposed<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
reputation for appealing to academic types. It's also one of the most
opinionated languages I know of; all the specs of interest lead with an
assertion that "programming languages should be designed not by piling feature
on top of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make
additional features appear necessary." The way that Scheme embraces purity and
simplicity makes it clear it was designed by math nerds. (Hey, I'm a math nerd,
too. Take it easy.)
</p>

<p>
As I've just mentioned, there are specs. A few, to be sure. The evolution of
Scheme standards begins in a linear fashion: RRS → RRRS → R3RS → R4RS → R5RS. I
like to think of this as "classic Scheme". But when it came time to revise R5RS,
the ratification of the subsequent R6RS caused some controversy. It was
"bloated", or whatever. Something like that. So when it came time to design R7RS
(small), the Scheme Language Steering Committee decided to let the language
fork, beginning with the earlier R5RS as a blank slate [4]. That way, the nerds
that hated everything about R6RS could have their way, and the nerds that liked
R6RS could have their way. Scheme was divided, but at peace. Oh, and nowadays
there's a work-in-progress <a href="https://bitbucket.org/cowan/r7rs-wg1-infra/src/default/R7RSHomePage.md">R7RS-large</a>. ಠ_ಠ

What follows is my personal exploration for how I assess abstractions.</p><h2>Problem</h2><p>We add abstractions in our programs to solve problems. So, let’s start with the fundamental value proposition: what problem does our abstraction solve? </p><p>Let’s take a look at one example abstraction:</p><pre><code>NLP.parse(...) // =&gt; { intent: "set_alarm", at: "1593538633430" }</code></pre><p>This could be a natural language processing abstraction, which lets us take a piece of text, and extract meaning from it. The inherent problem of natural language processing is pretty darn complex, so an abstraction that helps us solve it would be very valuable. This is a sign of a good abstraction.</p><p>Now let’s compare that to </p><pre><code>StringSplitter.easySplit(str, splitStr)</code></pre><p>Maybe this abstraction, adds a light layer on top of string.split. For example, it may make it so you don’t have to worry about regexes, and can turn common string patterns into regexes. The value of a <code>StringSplitter</code> abstraction is pretty darn low. Maybe  <code>StringSplitter</code> treats <code>splitStr</code> in a way that’s a bit more in-line with the someone’s thinking, but at the end of the day this boils down to an indirection. </p><p>This leads us to the first principle. The more complex the problem it solves for you, the better the abstraction (1).</p><h2>Interface</h2><p>After we’re convinced that the abstraction we are about to add solves a tough problem for us, the next thing to consider is the interface: <em>how</em> do we interact with the abstraction? Imagine if <code>NLP.parse</code> was called like this:</p><pre><code>NLP.parse(lang, text)</code></pre><p>This is a great interface. It’s small. We don’t need to understand any internals.

)</code></pre><p>In order to use this version, we’d need to deeply understand the internals of NLP.parse. This lowers the value of the abstraction, because we need to do more work to solve the same level of complexity. </p><p>This leads us to the second principle: <strong>great abstractions have small interfaces.</strong></p><h2>Breakthrough Cost</h2><p>Now that we have an abstraction with a simple interface that solves a hard problem, we need to ask a possibly fatal question: what happens when we need to break through the abstraction? </p><p>All abstractions are leaky at some point. What will happen when you need the abstraction to behave differently? What will happen when it doesn’t work as you expect? </p><p>For example, for <code>NLP.parse(lang, text)</code>, what if we needed to sort and score the results differently? What if there’s a bug, and we aren’t getting the entity we expect, can we look through and debug?</p><p>Understanding the answer to this, will give us the breakthrough cost. To do this, we need to peak through the code. How is <code>NLP.parse</code> implemented?</p><pre><code>parse(lang, text) { 
  return format(scoreEntities(fetchEntities(lang, text)))
}</code></pre><p>In one solution, it could be composed of other abstractions that we can take advantage of. This is a great sign, because we can reuse the underlying abstractions in cases where we need to do something more complicated. Compare that to </p><pre><code>parse(lang, text) { 
  internalParse(lang, text, flagA, flagB, ...flagZ)
}</code></pre><p>This feels more dangerous. If these flags all head to the same function, it’s a sign that a bunch of different features are complected together. It’s also worrying: what if one of these flags don’t do what you want? you may have to fork the abstraction.</p><p>This leads us to the third principle: <strong>great abstractions are transparent.</strong> I think this principle is the most overlooked. It’s easy to take the productivity win upfront, but if the abstraction you add can’t be changed, and can’t be introspected, it’s very likely to bite you at some point.</p><h2>Generality</h2><p>The final principle is orthogonal to the last three, but maybe it’s the most important. Hardy said <em>there is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics —</em> So it is with abstractions. The beauty in math relates to how “general” and “tight” the solution is. I think this parallels well with abstractions. </p><p>If you use an abstraction that is “essentially” simpler, it’s more likely to last, and it’s likely to be more powerful.</p><p>Consider if the abstraction for <code>NLP</code>, was made up of specific algorithms, <em>just</em> for natural language processing. This would still be very valuable, but what would be <em>even more</em> valuable, is if the abstractions that this library was composed of was more general: if the parts that compose it were deep learning abstractions, you could reuse them for other problems.</p><h2>Fin</h2><p>And we reach the end. To pick great abstractions: pick the ones that solve a complex problem for you. Make sure they have a simple interface, and take a look at the internals, so you’re confident you can jig things up if needed. The more general and simple you can get for the same amount of power, the better. </p><p>Want to see some great abstractions in the wild? First, chances are you are using many of them: TCP, higher order functions like map &amp; filter, React. Some you may not have explored: Go’s CSP, Rich Hickey’s Datomic, or his <code>seq</code> abstraction in Clojure. As you pick up abstractions, I encourage you to run each one as an experiment: ask yourself at the end how things went, discuss them with your friends, and soon you’ll develop a much more nuanced taste.</p><p>(1) The rabbit hole gets deeper. Even if an abstraction solves a complex problem you have, you may need to take a step back and also ask: why do I have this problem? For example, kubernetes may be a great solution to building distributed systems, but why do you have a distributed systems problem? Many times the problem itself can be avoided. For the answer to that, <a href="https://stopa.io/post/241" target="_blank">Hacker’s Paradise</a> tries to covers it.</p><p><em>Thanks to Alex Reichert, Daniel Woelfel, Martin Raison, Sean Grove for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Disqus is one of the most popular commenting systems out there. However, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/05/zeta-global-acquires-commenting-service-disqus/">ZetaGlobal acquired Disqus in 2017</a> that changed the path of it. ZetaGlobal is a data-powered marketing technology company that “loves data”. So, they started using Disqus to collect data from millions of users around the world who visit websites that use Disqus as the commenting platform. Because of the “apparently free” pricing plan, Disqus had millions of websites using it, which made their data set the <a href="http://data.disqus.com/">largest on the web</a>. Disqus has lost a lot of users in recent times due to these privacy concerns, and there are plenty of reasons to remove Disqus. This blog post sums up 19 reasons why you should move away from Disqus.</p>
<h2>Reasons to Move Away From Disqus</h2>
<h3>1. Disqus places Ads on your Website</h3>
<p>If you are using the free plan of Disqus, they place ads on your website. This results in increased page load times, which will hurt your <a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/on-page-seo-checklist/">on-page SEO</a>. It is also a bad experience for your users. Disqus seems to be crashing every party without any invitation. </p>
<h3>2. Disqus places Affiliate Links on your Website automatically</h3>
<p><a href="https://poststatus.com/disqus-potentially-adding-affiliate-links-users-content-opted/">Disqus was caught</a> placing affiliate links on the website without the consent of website owners. <a href="https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717122-how-to-disable-affiliate-linking">The official documentation says</a> that you cannot turn off affiliate links placed within the comments.</p>
<p>Let’s say one of your commenters mention “buy a camera on Amazon” (without links). Disqus will detect this and place a link from Amazon on this anchor text. When someone clicks this link and buys a product, Disqus will receive a commission. </p>
<blockquote><p>Disqus makes money <strong>from your content</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<h3>3. Disqus is Owned by a Data/Marketing Company</h3>
<p>Most publishers think Disqus is a standalone company, which empowers social conversations on websites. Wrong! It is owned by a company called ZetaGlobal where your visitors become the product. &nbsp;Automattic founder&nbsp;<a href="https://replyable.com/2017/03/disqus-is-your-data-worth-trading-for-convenience/">Matt Mullenweg said in 2014</a>, “We’re tracking everyone who visits a website with Disqus enabled and building a profile on them based on the content of the sites they visit and any comments they leave. “Deeper” than Facebook.” This just says it all, doesn’t it?</p>
<h3>4. Disqus sells your Visitors’ Data without their Consent and has Violated GDPR</h3>
<p>Disqus collects user’s data from millions of their client websites. Worst, they sell them to big companies <strong>without the user’s consent</strong>. Their <a href="http://data.disqus.com/">data.disqus.com</a> website says their clients include companies like Twitter. <a href="https://twitter.com/martingund/status/1207327648093003777">This twitter thread</a> by Martin Gundersen reveals more information about their data selling. He calls Disqus a “Data Machine”.</p>
<h3>5. You are already Paying Disqus even when you Use the Free Plan (Spoiler: Your visitors are the products)</h3>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, the free plan isn’t free. You help the data company collect data. For example, assume that a.com and b.com have Disqus installed. You visit both websites on the same day. And, Disqus knows it! This is a crucial connection in the advertising field. When they sell it to another company, they will also know that you visited a.com and b.com. Advertising companies use this data to personalize the ads for you. So, there will be thousands of companies knowing what are your interests. </p>
<p>The same thing happens to your visitors. By using Disqus on your website, you are giving Disqus an opportunity to track them.</p>
<h3>6. You have to Pay to Remove Ads – But, there’s no Guarantee about User Tracking</h3>
<p>While you can subscribe to a paid plan of Disqus to remove advertisements on your website, there’s no mention if they stop tracking users. Disqus seems to track you and remember your computer, so to create another account and actually be able to comment, you have to find another computer. You’re being tracked in the name of advertising every step of the way on the Internet. In fact, Disqus is using the plugin to&nbsp;<strong>profile your visitors to later target them with ads</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>7. Disqus makes your Website extremely Slow</h3>
<p>By injecting ads and third-party code to your website, Disqus will make your website extremely slow. Here’s a list of HTTP requests Disqus can add to your website:</p>
<figure><img src="https://fatfrogmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gtmetrix-redirects-problems-from-disqus-ads.jpg" alt="gtmetrix redirects problems from disqus ads" data-src="https://fatfrogmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gtmetrix-redirects-problems-from-disqus-ads.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption>Source: fatfrogmedia.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>The more HTTP requests you have the slower your website is. Disqus adds hundreds of spammy redirect links to your website. Additionally, it fetches a bunch of CSS and JS files to render the ads and affiliate links on your website. Even worst, these links come from third-party domains, which takes even more time to load due to <a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/dns/">DNS resolving</a>. Additionally most people don’t have the time to create an account or switch between their Disqus profiles just to comment on a blog post. The year 2020 is all about hyper-distraction and inattentiveness. People ignore things that hinder progress. No one wants to spend five seconds logging into an account just to comment.</p>
<h3>8. Disqus discourages Commenters</h3>
<p>Disqus has millions of user accounts. However, it’s just a little fraction compared to 4 billion active internet users. Disqus doesn’t have a guest commenting option. While those who have Disqus accounts can comment easily from their account, what about others? Creating a new account just to post a comment isn’t reasonable. Guest commenting is a powerful option to have!</p>
<h3>9. Moderating in Disqus is complicated</h3>
<p>When you add a new website to Disqus, it creates a new subdomain for that website. You’ll need to switch between these subdomains every time if you moderate multiple websites. It makes moderation slower (And, it’s why <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Slack/comments/d51ppa/slack_redirects_subdomain_to_appslackcom/">Slack moved from subdomains to app.slack.com</a> in their web version). </p>
<p>And, their admin panel isn’t a single page application, which makes it even slower.</p>
<h3>10. Disqus is Old-fashioned</h3>
<p>At the time of 2010, Disqus’s design was innovative. However, this is 2020. There are new and better practices and tools to make web applications more user friendly. Despite its resources, the company failed to make the product user-friendly. The usability factor is a good enough reason to remove Disqus.</p>
<h3>11. Disqus isn’t Customizable</h3>
<p>Disqus has a similar appearance in all websites. It would be impossible to see the discussion box due to the color scheme; on certain website templates, the discussion box would be almost invisible. A visitor would not be able leave a comment because the discussion box may appear to be missing. The fact is that it is not possible to apply custom CSS to the new Disqus. The plugin will automatically apply a scheme based on the text color it inherits from a website. So depending on whether your template’s stylesheet has a light or dark color scheme, Disqus will make a selection. It cannot be as customized as you love. </p>
<h3>12. Disqus’s Pricing isn’t Flexible</h3>
<p>Disqus has free, plus ($9/month), pro ($89/month), and business (Custom pricing) plans. <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/why-people-buy-factors-influence-purchase-descision#sm.0001o2k17imgbe7411rqj2vln3h2q">80% of consumers</a>&nbsp;consider pricing as a major deciding factor when shopping online: This is not only applicable to e-commerce sites but even to those in the plugin market. If you’re looking for more control over how you pay for a commenting platform, then look for that one option, which offers you a great deal of flexibility and added features.</p>
<h3>13. Disqus only has Single Sign-on in their Custom Pricing Plans</h3>
<p><a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/documentation/sso/introduction">Single sign-on (SSO)</a> is the most important feature for most companies. Disqus only provides it in their custom pricing plans, which is very expensive.</p>
<h3>14. Disqus Admins ban Websites without any Notifications</h3>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/disqus.com">some reviews</a> saying their websites are banned by Disqus for no reason.</p>
<h3>15. Users are banned for Political Opinions</h3>
<p>Freedom of speech is important. There are many converstaions going on regarding Disqus banning users (not moderators of websites but disqus admins) for just having political opinions.</p>
<h3>16. Disqus Exports your Data into a Messy XML Format</h3>
<p>If you ever need to import Disqus comments to your own database, you’ll need more developer resources as Disqus imports the data into a messy XML format. </p>
<h3>17. Disqus adds “Do Not Sell My Data” Badge to your Website</h3>
<p>Do you like to have such irritating badge on your website?</p>
<figure><img src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-4.png" alt="Do not sell my data badge by Disqus" data-src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-4.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption>Do not sell my data – Disqus</figcaption></figure>
<p>There’s one more thing to consider: Those who don’t know this badge is placed by Disqus may think <strong>you (the publisher) are selling data</strong>. Want to destroy the trust between you and your visitors? If no is the answer, you’ll definitely need to remove Disqus from your site and move to a new privacy-focused solution.</p>
<h3>18. Disqus has a Heavy Spam Detector</h3>
<p>Disqus’s spam detector is known to be harsh. It’s worst when non-spam comments are detected as spam. Again, destroying the trust between your users and you!</p>
<h3>19. Disqus Support is Poor</h3>
<p>Disqus <a href="https://disqus.com/home/channel/discussdisqus/discussion/channel-discussdisqus/poor_customer_support_from_disqus/best/">reportedly</a> has poor customer support. Moreover, it will be super hard to contact them if you have a problem to solve with your website. It will be impossible to do so if you are on their free plan.</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/technology/twitter-hackers-interview.html"> New York Times story on the recent Twitter hack</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>Mr. O’Connor said other hackers had informed him that Kirk got access to the Twitter credentials when he found a way into Twitter’s internal Slack messaging channel and saw them posted there, along with a service that gave him access to the company’s servers.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>It’s too soon after this incident to put too much faith in the reporting, but let’s assume it’s accurate. A collective cry of “<em>Posting credentials to a Slack channel? How could engineers at Twitter be so stupid?</em>” rose up from the internet. It’s a natural reaction, but it’s not a constructive one.</p>



<p>I don’t personally know any engineers at Twitter, but I have confidence that they have excellent engineers over there, including excellent security folks. So, how do we explain this seemingly obvious security lapse?</p>



<p>The problem is that we on the outside can’t, because we don’t have enough information. This type of lapse is a classic example of a <em>workaround</em>. People in a system use workarounds (they do things the “<em>wrong</em>” way) when there are obstacles to doing things the “right” way.</p>



<p>There are countless possibilities for why people employ workarounds. Maybe some system that’s required for doing it the “right” way is down for some reason, or maybe it simply takes too long or is too hard to do things the “right” way. Combine that with production pressures, and a workaround is born.</p>



<p>I’m willing to bet that there are people in your organization that use workarounds. You probably use some yourself. Identifying those workarounds teaches us something about how the system works, and how people have to do things the “wrong” way to actually get their work done.</p>



<p>Some workarounds, like the Twitter example, are dangerous. But simply observing “they shouldn’t have done that” does nothing to address the problems in the system that motivated the workaround in the first place.</p>



<p>When you see a workaround, don’t ask “how could they be so stupid to do things the obviously wrong way?” Instead, ask “what are the properties of our system that contributed to the development of this workaround?” Because, unless you gain a deeper understanding of your system, the problems that motivated the workaround aren’t going to go away.</p>

<p> 

In the last few years there has been quite a lot of activity in homebrew Retro-computing.  I really liked seeing things like the <a href="https://www.linusakesson.net/scene/craft/">Craft Demo</a>, the <a href="http://belogic.com/uzebox/index.asp">UzeBox</a>, The <a href="https://gigatron.io/">Gigatron</a> and <a href="https://eater.net/">Ben Eater's</a> amazing work in making all of this stuff accessible to mere mortals.  There are a lot of toy projects out there generating video signals, sometimes composite, sometimes VGA occasionally something more exotic.   This has inspired me to address something that has bugged me for a long long time in the hope that people might want do do some 4 bit digital output to generate a 16 colour palette that isn't completely hideous.</p>

<h3>Here's the problem </h3><p>

This is the original CGA palette.  Known as RGBI, four digital lines for Red, Green, Blue, and Intensity.  it looks like this 
</p><center><table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td> Black </td>
    <td> Red </td>
    <td> Green </td>
    <td> Dry Snot</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td> Blue </td>
    <td> Sad Magenta </td>
    <td> Sad Cyan </td>
    <td> Light Grey</td>
  </tr>  

  <tr>
    <td> Dark Grey </td>
    <td> Light Red </td>
    <td> Light Green </td>
    <td> Yellow</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td> Liht Blue </td>
    <td> Magenta</td>
    <td> Cyan </td>
    <td> White</td>
  </tr>  
  </tbody><caption>The Beauty that is RGBI.</caption>  
  </table>
  </center><p>
  
This arrangement of colours is somewhat unappealing.    To mitigate the worst of this a special case was introduced on the low intensity yellow colour where they halved the green brightness for that one colour.
This was a change to the monitors, not the video card, which strictly speaking had no concept of colour and merely output signals on 4 digital wires..
  

</p><center>
    <table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td> Black </td>
    <td> Red </td>
    <td> Green </td>
    <td> Brown</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr><td> Blue </td>
    <td> Sad Magenta </td>
    <td> Sad Cyan </td>
    <td> Light Grey</td>
  </tr>  

  <tr>
    <td> Dark Grey </td>
    <td> Light Red </td>
    <td> Light Green </td>
    <td> Yellow</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td> Liht Blue </td>
    <td> Magenta</td>
    <td> Cyan </td>
    <td> White</td>
  </tr>  
  </tbody><caption>  Much better, right, let's go to the pub.</caption>
  </table>
  </center><p>

 
This addition of brown helped a great deal, especially if you wanted wood <br></p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eQbeZOWqd-s/XxTxn7TDS6I/AAAAAAAAAbU/h8kz0vqfepQLAlF26mCpgbgm7NJYKsO_wCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/Keen4.gif"><img data-original-height="400" data-original-width="640" height="313" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eQbeZOWqd-s/XxTxn7TDS6I/AAAAAAAAAbU/h8kz0vqfepQLAlF26mCpgbgm7NJYKsO_wCLcBGAsYHQ/w500-h313/Keen4.gif" width="500"></a></p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IZWXYXHetGY/XxTxwh4gC1I/AAAAAAAAAbY/6zlO7dAxq5gpL-tb-gx-MMjELlsHBfzlwCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/Keen8.gif"><img data-original-height="400" data-original-width="640" height="313" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IZWXYXHetGY/XxTxwh4gC1I/AAAAAAAAAbY/6zlO7dAxq5gpL-tb-gx-MMjELlsHBfzlwCLcBGAsYHQ/w500-h313/Keen8.gif" width="500"></a></p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ge4w2gcgU8g/XxTx7LokUaI/AAAAAAAAAbg/Mk6P0X1Jk8kbrmZnmo4qSmg523zWLFRBQCLcBGAsYHQ/s740/the-colonels-bequest-1989_kf57.1080.jpg"><img data-original-height="555" data-original-width="740" height="375" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ge4w2gcgU8g/XxTx7LokUaI/AAAAAAAAAbg/Mk6P0X1Jk8kbrmZnmo4qSmg523zWLFRBQCLcBGAsYHQ/w500-h375/the-colonels-bequest-1989_kf57.1080.jpg" width="500"></a></p><p>


People managed to do quite a bit with that set but it wasn't an ideal arrangement.  When I look at homebrew video generators I can't help but think that there is a tendency to go with six or eight digital lines because four digital lines brings memory of this palette.    I wanted to know how much better you could make four digital lines without adding too much complexity.</p><h3>How did RGBI work anyway</h3><p>  
For starters lets look at an RGBI output mechanism.</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rUu08JAtrqY/XxTv8IJswgI/AAAAAAAAAa0/QAuDa5Z6UoAYt9X05-qA4HCvd43R7jkXQCLcBGAsYHQ/s929/Marcel%2Bhackaday%2Brgbi.png"><img data-original-height="522" data-original-width="929" height="351" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rUu08JAtrqY/XxTv8IJswgI/AAAAAAAAAa0/QAuDa5Z6UoAYt9X05-qA4HCvd43R7jkXQCLcBGAsYHQ/w625-h351/Marcel%2Bhackaday%2Brgbi.png" width="625"></a></p><p>

This circuit is designed to convert four digital 5V lines coming in at the bottom to three analog signals for Red, Green and Blue.  This particular one places the Analog signals into the 0.0V - 0.7V range of a 75 Ohm VGA input.   The intensity line on the right contributes to each of the red green and blue lines evenly to make all levels brighter.  The diodes on the right prevent the original Red, Green, and Blue signals from  crossing over into the other channels.   Those diodes are not strictly necessary though, we are aiming for a visual representation, not mathematical accuracy. </p><h3>Let's do the dumbed down version</h3>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8nOaxU1nrSE/XxT0WWgkTsI/AAAAAAAAAcM/BYj31WTzBYkL0Z8SoLlnUXaWLkdyO9B-ACLcBGAsYHQ/s932/Marcel%2Bhackaday%2Brgbi%2B-%2Bno%2Bdiodes.png"><img data-original-height="446" data-original-width="932" height="299" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8nOaxU1nrSE/XxT0WWgkTsI/AAAAAAAAAcM/BYj31WTzBYkL0Z8SoLlnUXaWLkdyO9B-ACLcBGAsYHQ/w625-h299/Marcel%2Bhackaday%2Brgbi%2B-%2Bno%2Bdiodes.png" width="625"></a></p><p>

This arrangement eliminates the diodes. This means that when the Red line is on a small amount of current can travel back through the intensity resistors and onto the Blue and Green lines.  Running the numbers shows it's not really a problem though because the voltage is already dropped fairly low and has to go through another two resistors to get out one of the other lanes.  When the any one the RGB lines provides 0.3V a sneaky 0.01V slips through to the other two.  When two of the RGB lines are high the remaining one receives an extra 0.02V which isn't noticeable.</p><h3>Now mix things up</h3><p>  
To come up with a better arrangement, the plan was to introduce some asymmetry in the resistors to see what colours would come out.  I still wanted all lines High to provide white and all lines Low to be Black.  The rule of thumb is that if I drop the resistance on one of the colour lines I should correspondingly increase the resistance on the intensity line that contributes to that colour.  </p><p>

In this sense you would represent the traditional RGBI as
</p>
<center>
<table>
  <tbody><tr><th> Output line </th> <th>Color Resistor</th> <th> Intensity Resistor</th> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Red </td> <td> High </td> <td> Low </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Green </td> <td> High </td> <td> Low </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Blue </td> <td> High </td> <td> Low </td> </tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>
<p>
These are not merely boolean options, a range of medium values are available.  You have a restriction that no output combination should produce a voltage higher than 0.7V on any line.  Additionally if you want to have a white, you need to have a set of resisters that provide 0.7V on all three RGB lines when all of the input lines are high.  Initially i tried an arrangement something like this.</p><center>
<table>
  <tbody><tr><th> Output line </th> <th>Color Resistor</th> <th> Intensity Resistor</th> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Red </td> <td> Low </td> <td> High </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Green </td> <td> Medium </td> <td> Medium </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Blue </td> <td> High </td> <td> Low </td> </tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>

<h3>A hint of lane crossing</h3><p>
I did some quick calculations on the colors and, while better,  I felt that the problem areas of the original RGBI system remained.  A good brown needs more Red than Green   So I tried shunting a little green over to red. After more tweaking and fiddling I decided to do the same with blue shunting to green and came up with 

</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AON7kUcR8tA/XxUAI7w6agI/AAAAAAAAAco/7AiKXLcmJs4ggCO2KNb05MmEVhbi1CMOgCLcBGAsYHQ/s960/Rgbi-alt.png"><img data-original-height="519" data-original-width="960" height="338" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AON7kUcR8tA/XxUAI7w6agI/AAAAAAAAAco/7AiKXLcmJs4ggCO2KNb05MmEVhbi1CMOgCLcBGAsYHQ/w625-h338/Rgbi-alt.png" width="625"></a></p><div>

  <h3>What should that look like?</h3><p> 
In theory the voltages produced by this arrangement of resistors should produce a palette something like this.</p><center><table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td> Black </td>
    <td> Red </td>
    <td> Green </td>
    <td> Brown</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td> Dark Blue </td>
    <td> Purple </td>
    <td> Sea Green</td>
    <td> Pale Brown</td>
  </tr>  

  <tr>
   <td>Steel Blue</td>
    <td> Blush</td>
    <td> Leaf Green </td>
    <td> Yellow</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td> Denim Blue </td>
    <td> Mauve</td>
    <td> Cyan </td>
    <td> White</td>
  </tr>  
  </tbody><caption>A theoretically better palette.</caption>
  
  </table>
  </center>
<p>
To me, that looks like a better set of colors.  We now have two tones of brown. The yellow is less intense, and stab-your-eyes magenta has been mellowed to a mauve. Sad magenta has been shifted over slightly to be a purple.  Sad cyan is now greener for a nice sea green. The pure greys are gone and replaced with pale colours. I'm rather happy with it.  
</p></div>

<h3>What does it actually look like?</h3>
<div><p>
Of course this doesn't mean anything unless i can actually get it working.   I wrote a small Arduino program to throw out some VGA 640x480 timings and a simple test pattern and put the resistor arrangement on a piece of breadboard.  I'm not well equipped when it comes to actually making things. So my creation was a bit of a Frankenstein's monster of what resisters I had lying about wired in combinations to make values close to what I needed.</p><p>
 In the end I got the Arduino outputting a signal that resembled VGA enough for a monitor to display it. <br></p></div><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iNIIxmM1ASk/XxUvURltVPI/AAAAAAAAAdE/QN4ufc1rsGIMiCjWU65dJU8CAZTEipp2gCLcBGAsYHQ/s800/IMG_20200720_173606.jpg"><img data-original-height="745" data-original-width="800" height="583" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iNIIxmM1ASk/XxUvURltVPI/AAAAAAAAAdE/QN4ufc1rsGIMiCjWU65dJU8CAZTEipp2gCLcBGAsYHQ/w625-h583/IMG_20200720_173606.jpg" width="625"></a></p>
  <div><p>
  I was actually pretty chuffed to get colours that close to what I had calculated.       The stripes on the side a a series of 1,2,3 and 4 clock cycle bands.   Because the monitor is expecting 640x480 the digital nature of the LCD is quantizing to make the thinner bars uneven.  I'm a little torn between the simplicity of getting picture out of a plain Arduino or going for a 25.175MHz clocked chip and seeing what I can get it to do.</p></div>
  <p>
    Today's objective is however complete. Giving a better set of 4 bit colours hopefully will be of use to someone and inspire them to make some cool things with hardware that was never meant for that purpose.   At two pixels per byte there is less data to move around so potentially allowing for new things.  I already have a few ideas.  A 74LS157 would fairly easily handle turning a byte into two pixels. leaving more time for fetching the pixels in exotic manners.  An Arduino would probably use a 74LS158 and a 74LS04 because of the creatively inverted outputs on PORTD. <br></p>

<p>Recent advances in machine learning are consistently enabled by
<a href="https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-compute/">increasing amounts of
computation</a>. More
and more algorithms exploit parallelism and rely on distributed training
for processing an enormous amount of data. Both the need for more data
and more training impose great challenges on the software that manages
and utilizes the large scale computational resource.</p>
<p>Within Uber, we've developed algorithms like
<a href="https://eng.uber.com/poet-open-ended-deep-learning/">POET</a>,
<a href="https://eng.uber.com/go-explore/">Go-Explore</a>,
<a href="https://eng.uber.com/generative-teaching-networks/">GTN</a>,
etc., that leverage a large amount of computation. To enable future
generations of large-scale computation for algorithms like these, we
have developed a new system called <strong>Fiber</strong> that helps users scale what
might otherwise be only local computation to hundreds or even thousands
of machines with ease.</p>
<h3 id="the-challenge-of-large-scale-distributed-computation">The challenge of large-scale distributed computation<a href="#the-challenge-of-large-scale-distributed-computation" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>In an ideal world, scaling an application that runs on one machine to an
application that runs on a cluster of machines should be as easy as
changing a command-line argument. However, that is not an easy task in
the real world.</p>
<p>While working with many people who run large scale distributed computing
jobs on a daily basis, we found that there are several reasons why it is
so hard to harness distributed computing nowadays:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>There is a huge gap between making code work locally on laptops or
    desktops and running code on a production cluster.</strong> You can make
    MPI work locally but it's a completely different process to run
    it on a computer cluster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No dynamic scaling is available.</strong> If you launch a job that
    requires a large amount of resources, then most likely you'll
    need to wait until everything is allocated before you can run your
    job. This waiting to scale up makes it less efficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Error handling is missing.</strong> While running, some jobs may fail.
    And you may be put into a very nasty situation where you have to
    recover part of the result or discard the whole run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>High learning cost.</strong> Each system has different APIs and
    conventions for programming. To launch jobs with a new system, a
    user has to learn a set of completely new conventions before jobs
    can be launched.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The new Fiber platform addresses each of these issues explicitly,
potentially opening up seamless large-scale distributed computing to a
much wider population of users.</p>
<h3 id="introducing-fiber">Introducing Fiber<a href="#introducing-fiber" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/uber/fiber">Fiber</a> is a Python-based
distributed computing library for modern computer clusters. Instead of
programming your desktop or laptop, now you can program the whole
computer cluster. Originally, it was developed to power large scale
parallel scientific computation projects like
<a href="https://eng.uber.com/poet-open-ended-deep-learning/">POET</a>
and it has been used to power similar projects within Uber. The key
features of Fiber include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Easy to use.</strong> Fiber allows you to write programs that run on a
    computer cluster without the need to dive into the details of the
    computer cluster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Easy to learn.</strong> Fiber provides the same API as Python's standard
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/multiprocessing.html">multiprocessing</a>
    library that people are familiar with. If you know how to use
    multiprocessing, you can program a computer cluster with Fiber.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fast performance.</strong> Fiber's communication backbone is built on
    top of <a href="https://nanomsg.org/">Nanomsg</a>, which is a
    high-performance asynchronous messaging library to allow fast and
    reliable communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No need for deployment.</strong> You run Fiber application the same way
    as running a normal application on a computer cluster and Fiber
    handles the rest for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reliable computation.</strong> Fiber has built-in error handling when you
    are running a pool of workers. Users can focus on writing the
    actual application code instead of dealing with crashed workers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, Fiber can be used together with other specialized
frameworks in areas where performance is critical. Examples include
distributed SGD where many existing frameworks like
<a href="https://github.com/horovod/horovod">Horovod</a> or
<a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html">torch.distributed</a>
have already provided very good solutions. Fiber can be used together
with such platforms by using Fiber's <a href="https://uber.github.io/fiber/experimental/ring/">Ring
feature</a>
to help to set up a distributed training job on computer clusters.</p>
<p><img alt="fiber_overview" src="https://uber.github.io/fiber/img/fiber_overview.png"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1: Fiber overview.</strong> The diagram shows how Fiber works on a
computer cluster. It starts many different job-backed-processes and runs
different Fiber components and user processes inside them. Fiber Master
is the main process that manages all the other processes. Some processes
like Ring Node maintain communications between each member.</p>
<p>Fiber can (1) help users who are working on large-scale distributed
computing to reduce the time to go from ideas to actually running
distributed jobs on computation clusters, (2) shield users from details
of configuration and resource allocation tasks, (3) enable faster debug
cycles, and (4) simplify the transition from local to cluster
development.</p>
<h3 id="architecture">Architecture<a href="#architecture" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Fiber bridges the classical multiprocessing API with a flexible
selection of backends that can run on different cluster management
systems. To achieve this integration, Fiber is split into three
different layers: the <strong>API layer</strong>, <strong>backend layer</strong> and <strong>cluster
layer</strong>. The <strong>API layer</strong> provides basic building blocks for Fiber like
processes, queues, pools and managers. They have the same semantics as
in multiprocessing, but are extended to work in distributed
environments. The <strong>backend layer</strong> handles tasks like creating or
terminating jobs on different cluster managers. When a new backend is
added, all the other Fiber components (queues, pools, etc.) do not need
to be changed. Finally, the <strong>cluster layer</strong> consists of different
cluster managers. Although they are not a part of Fiber itself, they
help Fiber to manage resources and keep track of different jobs, thereby
reducing the number of items that Fiber needs to track. This overall
architecture is summarized in figure 2.</p>
<p><img alt="fiber_architecture" src="https://uber.github.io/fiber/img/fiber_architecture.png"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 2: Fiber architecture.</strong></p>
<h3 id="job-backed-process">Job-Backed Process<a href="#job-backed-process" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Fiber introduces a new concept called <em>job-backed processes</em> (also
called a <em>Fiber process</em>). It is similar to the <em>process</em> in Python's
multiprocessing library, but more flexible: while a process in
multiprocessing only runs on a local machine, a Fiber process can run
remotely on a different machine or locally on the same machine. When
starting a new Fiber process, Fiber creates a new job with the proper
Fiber backend on the current computer cluster.</p>
<p><img alt="fiber_process" src="https://uber.github.io/fiber/img/fiber_process.png"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 3: Job-backed processes.</strong> Each job-backed process is a
containerized job running on the computer cluster. Each job-backed
process will also have its own allocation of CPU, GPU and other types of
resources. The code that runs inside the container is self-contained.</p>
<p>Fiber uses containers to encapsulate the running environment of current
processes, including all the required files, input data, other dependent
program packages, etc., to ensure everything is self-contained. All the
child processes are started with the same container image as the parent
process to guarantee a consistent running environment. Because each
process is a cluster job, its life cycle is the same as any job on the
cluster. To make it easy for users, Fiber is designed to directly
interact with computer cluster managers. Because of this, Fiber doesn't
need to be set up on multiple machines or bootstrapped by any other
mechanisms, unlike Spark or IPyParallel. It only needs to be installed
on a single machine as a normal Python pip package.</p>
<h3 id="components">Components<a href="#components" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Fiber implements most multiprocessing APIs on top of Fiber processes
including pipes, queues, pools, and managers.</p>
<p><em>Queues and pipes</em> in Fiber behave the same as in multiprocessing. The
difference is that queues and pipes are now shared by multiple processes
running on different machines. Two processes can read from and write to
the same pipe. Furthermore, queues can be shared among many processes on
different machines and each process can send to or receive from the same
queue at the same time. Fiber's queue is implemented with Nanomsg, a
high-performance asynchronous message queue system.</p>
<p><img alt="fiber_queue" src="https://uber.github.io/fiber/img/fiber_queue.png"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 4: Fiber Queue.</strong> This diagram shows a Fiber queue shared
across three different Fiber processes. One Fiber process is located on
the same machine as the queue and the other two processes are located on
another machine. One process is writing to the queue and the other two
are reading from the queue.</p>
<p><em>Pools</em> are also supported by Fiber. They allow the user to manage a
pool of worker processes. Fiber extends pools with <em>job-backed
processes</em> so that it can manage thousands of (remote) workers per pool.
Users can also create multiple pools at the same time.</p>
<p><img alt="fiber_pool" src="https://uber.github.io/fiber/img/fiber_pool.png"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 5: Fiber Pool.</strong> A pool with 3 workers is shown. Two of them
are located on one machine and the other is located on a different
machine. They collectively work on tasks that are submitted to the task
queue in the master process and send results to the result queue.</p>
<p><em>Managers and proxy objects</em> enable Fiber to support shared storage,
which is critical to distributed systems. Usually, this function is
handled by external storage like Cassandra, Redis, etc. on a computer
cluster. Fiber instead provides built-in in-memory storage for
applications to use. The interface is the same as multiprocessing's
Manager type.</p>
<p><em>Rings</em> are an extension to the multiprocessing API that can be helpful
in distributed computing settings. A ring in Fiber stands for a group of
processes who work collectively together as relative equals. Unlike
<code>Pool</code>, <code>Ring</code> does not have the concept of a master process and
worker processes. All the members inside the <code>Ring</code> share about the
same responsibility. Fiber's Ring models a topology that is very common
in machine learning when doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent">distributed
SGD</a>.

<p>
    At this point, we are not as fond of Facebook as we used to be. We mostly
    are just not that active anymore, abandoned entirely, or even considering
    deleting our accounts. Something is holding us still, though; we have part
    of our history there. On each "status update", we registered a moment, those
    posts add up to document years of our lives.
</p>

<p>
    Even if you want to keep your Facebook account to save these memories,
    they are hidden from you by Facebook's newsfeed algorithm. Facebook
    decides which of your memories to surface, not you, and it is very
    cumbersome to search for them. If you want to move out of Facebook, but
    keep your Facebook history and gain the ability to search your old posts
    quickly, Quid Sentio can solve your problem.
</p>

<h3>Understanding Quid Sentio</h3>
<p>
	If you are not familiar with Quid Sentio yet, it is a digital personal
	journal that you can share with your real friends. Using text, audio, and
	custom tags, you create private entries, with an easy way to filter and
	search, and the ability to share and comment with trusted friends (real
	friends, not the ones that are your "facebook friends").
</p>
<p>
	Quid Sentio has an import tool for Facebook status updates posts. First, you
	have to export and download your data from your Facebook account, then
	upload that file to Quid Sentio, and all your status updates become
	searchable journal entries.
</p>

<h2>How to export your Facebook posts</h2>

<p>
	The first thing to do is to download a file from Facebook with all your posts. Here
	is a step-by-step tutorial on how to do it.
</p>

<p><em>Note: the screenshots presented here are from the new Facebook interface.
If your Facebook still has the old design, it might look different, but
the options are largely the same (or very similar). You should be able to follow
these steps without any issue.</em></p>

<h4>1. Go to your Facebook settings</h4>

<p>At the top right, click on the down arrow to open the menu. Select
<em>"Settings &amp; Privacy"</em> and then again <em>"Settings"</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/fb-menu.png" alt="Facebook menu, Settings &amp; Privacy option">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/fb-menu-2.png" alt="Facebook menu, Settings option"></p><h4>2. Select "Your Facebook Information" and "Download Your Information"</h4>

<p><em>Note: Quid Sentio is prepared to identify the Facebook information structure
when it's written in English. If you use Facebook in another language, I suggest
you change it to English before exporting your posts (it is ok for the posts
themselves to be in another language).</em></p>

<p>
	In the Settings page, select the option
	<em>"Your Facebook Information"</em> on the left side menu.
</p>

<p>
	Then, among the presented options, click on
	<em>"Download Your Information"</em>.
</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/fb-settings.png" alt="Facebook Settings page"></p><h4>3. Choose the format "JSON" and select "Posts" data to download</h4>

<p>You will see a box with download options. You must choose the format
<em>"JSON"</em>, so Quid Sentio can import your posts.</p>

<p>You can also decide which information you want to download. Quid Sentio will only
use <em>"Posts"</em>, but the information will be downloaded in separate files,
so you can choose as many as you want.</p>

<p>After selecting the <em>format: "JSON"</em> and <em>"Posts"</em>, click on the
button <em>"Create File"</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/fb-download-select.png" alt="Facebook Information Download options"></p><h4>4. Wait until your file is available and download it</h4>

<p>You can't download your information immediately; Facebook has to process your
request. You will receive an email informing you that they are processing the
request and another email as soon as the request is processed and ready for
download.
</p>

<p>
    If you selected only the <em>"Posts"</em> type of information, it would
    usually take no more than 5 minutes. It might take longer if you selected more
    types of information.
</p>



<p>Once your file is ready, go back to the same page (<em>Settings &gt; Your
Facebook Information &gt; Download Your Information</em>). There, click on the tab
<em>"Available Copies"</em> and click on the <em>"Download"</em> button of the file
listed there.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/fb-file-ready.png" alt="Facebook Information file ready to
download"></p><p>You will download a compressed ZIP file (ending in <code>.zip</code>) with
separate folders for each type of information that you selected to download. The
file with your posts is usually called <code>your_posts_1.json</code>. Extract this
file from the ZIP file.</p>

<p>Now you have your file with all your Facebook posts downloaded at your
computer. You are ready to import them to your Quid Sentio journal.</p>

<h4>5. Create your Quid Sentio account and upload your posts file</h4>

<p>Now the easy part. Go to <a href="https://www.quidsentio.com/" target="_blank">www.quidsentio.com</a> and Sign Up.</p>

<p>Then click on <em>"Account"</em> at the top right, and you will see the button
to <em>"Upload your posts .json file"</em>. Click on it and select the file you
just downloaded from Facebook with your posts (the one probably called
<code>your_posts_1.json</code>).</p>

<p>You will see how many status updates posts you have and show the button to
<em>"Start import process"</em>. Click on it and see the count of imported posts
going up. Please do not close the site or refresh the page until it finishes its
process.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-account.png" alt="Facebook Information file ready to
download">

<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-import.png" alt="Facebook Information file ready to
download"></p><p>That's it! You have now transformed all your Facebook status updates into
Quid Sentio journal entries. Experiment a little bit searching through your
older updates and explore your past in a way that Facebook never allowed!</p>

<h2><strong>Why</strong> transfer your posts from Facebook to Quid
Sentio?</h2>

<p>You know how to do it, but you might be wondering why do it. Here is a list
of a few advantages of having your Facebook update posts on Quid Sentio:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        You can search and filter your posts.<br>
        Quid Sentio clearly shows all your old posts, with easy ways to filter
        by keywords, also allowing you to add custom tags for future reference.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        You will not be tracked or manipulated to addiction at Quid Sentio.<br>
        Quid Sentio is not supported by ads, so there is no need to track your
        every move nor use every trick in the book to keep you mindlessly
        scrolling. Quid Sentio does not use any third-party client-side tracking.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        You will have better control over your privacy.<br>
        Every entry (including the imported ones) is visible only to you by
        default. You can add real friends to your Quid Sentio network and
        individually decide for each entry who can read it. There
        is no way to search for people at Quid Sentio. You will have only
        the people you manually added as your friends.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>A few disclaimers</h3>

<p>In case you are new to Quid Sentio, there are a few things that are important
for you to know before deciding to import your Facebook posts.</p>

<p>You will only import your Facebook Status updates posts. The downloaded "Posts"
file includes lots of other types of posts that are not status updates. Things
like posts on your friends' timelines, posts on groups, on events. Those things
do not match the format of journal entries, so all of those are ignored. Just
your status updates are imported as Quid Sentio entries.</p>

<p>You will not import your Facebook pictures. While Quid Sentio entries allow for
images, it is a very different experience from Facebook with its
albums. You are better off downloading Facebook pictures and keeping at your
computer or another photo service of your choice.</p>

<p>You will not import your Facebook "friends". Quid Sentio meaning of "friends"
is very different from Facebook's. I believe you should add friends to your Quid
Sentio network very consciously, adding only those you really trust. I designed
Quid Sentio to avoid "contact spam" of any form. So I will not ask or even allow
you to upload your list of friends to Quid Sentio. You have to add them one by
one.</p>

<p>Quid Sentio is a paid service, not supported by ads, but by customers that
pay for it if they find it valuable. While you can create an account for free and
import all your Facebook status posts also for free, after that, you will have
become a Supporter ($19/year) to be able to create more entries.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, you can import your posts and leave them at Quid Sentio for
free. Only if you want to continue to create new entries that you need to become
a paying supporter.</p>

<p>Quid Sentio still does not have an export tool of its own. I do believe
everyone should have control of all the data they update to an online service.
The only reason Quid Sentio does not have this feature is that I am the sole
developer of Quid Sentio, so things are a bit slow to build. The export tool is
on the roadmap, so rest assured that by the time you sign up to Quid Sentio,
create a few entries, and decide to move out to another service and export your
data, it will  be ready.</p>

  <p><img src="https://kylehovey.github.io/blog/images/automata_nebula/plots/selected_run/UMAP_CA_Full_Annotated.png" alt="UMAP Embedding"></p>

<p>In my <a href="https://kylehovey.github.io/blog/turing-basins">last post</a>, I shared my journey through understanding the link between entropy, thermodynamics, evolution, computation, and mathematics. At the end, I shared some preliminary research on using entropy/complexity to classify the behavior of Cellular Automata (CA) and perhaps pave a road to finding more universal CA (those <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My8AsV7bA94" target="blank">capable of computation</a>). At that time, I only had a handful of samples which, albeit showing promise, fell short of demonstrating concrete results.</p>

<p>I am incredibly excited to share that I have now run my simulations on <em>every possible</em> Life-Like Cellular Automaton rule (a total of 262,144 rules), and it shows some great potential in classifying every rule based on its emergent behavior. Not only that, but this method establishes what appears to be a strong metric for finding “islands” of rules that have similar behavior.</p>

<p>This is exciting news, because past classifications of even elementary CA such as the semi-totalistic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood" target="blank">Moore neighborhood</a> variety (called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-like_cellular_automaton" target="blank">Life-Like</a> CA) have either required generalizations that are computationally intractable to ascertain, or required a great deal of manual filtering and edge-case handling in order to separate sets of rules into classes.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p><img src="https://kylehovey.github.io/blog/images/automata_nebula/expository/rule_30.png" alt="Rule 30"></p>

<p>Stephen Wolfram (one of the biggest researchers in CA) <a href="https://wpmedia.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/13/2018/02/02-2-2.pdf" target="blank">proposed</a> a four-level classification scheme for one dimensional cellular automata. He later extended these definitions to include two-dimensional cellular automata like the Life-Like CA we are looking at here. The classifications are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Evolution leads to a homogeneous state.</em></li>
  <li><em>Evolution leads to a set of separated simple stable or periodic structures.</em></li>
  <li><em>Evolution leads to a chaotic pattern.</em></li>
  <li><em>Evolution leads to complex localized structures, sometimes long-lived.</em></li>
</ol>

<p>But, as mentioned in <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/ca/wolfram.html" target="blank">this post</a> regarding some caveats about these classifications, gliders have been found in all four of these classes. This is problematic because gliders are one of the most essential parts of data transmission in machines built inside of CA, so the four classes may not be enough to identify the presence or absence of a universal CA. Also, <a href="https://wpmedia.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/13/2018/02/02-2-2.pdf" target="blank">it has been shown</a> that, given a rule, finding which class a CA belongs to is an undecidable problem (for one-dimensional CA at least, but I would imagine the argument abstracts well to any Cartesian dimension).</p>

<p>My goal here was to focus on dynamic classification of the emergent properties of any given CA given its rules. By not subscribing to manually generated labels on classification, we can instead focus on developing a metric of similarity. In this sense, each rule becomes its own “class” and you can find rules that are sufficiently close in behavior to be considered the same class. Geometrically, this would be an analysis of CA by way of clustering.</p>

<p>The difficult part, of course, is developing a representation of a given rule that would allow for clustering. I settled on producing a curve of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity" target="blank">Kolmogorov complexity</a> across the generations of the automaton’s universe. My inspiration for this approach came from a few core concepts. First, that entropy and complexity looked like valid metrics to measure the emergent behavior of a system and its potential for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organized_criticality" target="blank">self-organized criticality</a>. My reasoning behind this intuition is that structure typically implies order, and order implies either repeating patterns or extension of structure that can be derived from existing structure. Kolmogorov complexity would capture the amount of bits required to express this structure. I later learned that this view is not a new one, as Wolfram took a similar approach in examining the procession of spacial and temporal entropy in <a href="https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/cellular-automata-complexity/pdfs/universality-complexity-cellular-automata.pdf" target="blank">his research on one-dimensional CA</a>.</p>

<p>In a addition to the convenient dualistic simplicity of studying life-or-death CA, the grid of an automaton can be interpreted as a bitmap image. Image compression is (unsurprisingly) adept at finding something close to the smallest possible representation of an image, and PNG compression does it without loss of information. Image compression asymptotically <a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulv/papers/cluster.pdf" target="blank">approximates Kolmogorov Complexity</a> <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266795088_A_Safe_Approximation_for_Kolmogorov_Complexity">up to a constant</a> dependent on the compression algorithm. Therefore, as the compression algorithm is the same for each measurement, we have a viable pipeline for estimating the Kolmogorov complexity of each state of the CA universes we encounter. If we wish to relate all of this back to entropy, we can do so. <a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulv/papers/info.pdf" target="blank">Entropy is the expected value of Kolmogorov Complexity</a> in this context, so this data will be useful for that as well.</p>

<p>In order to get an amortized generalization of each rule, I started from random initial states of the universe with each cell having an equal probability of starting in any of the possible states. I then ran simulations for hundreds of generations with multiple random initial conditions and found the average complexity at each step. Other researchers looking into the general behavior of CA have taken this approach of random initial state and it seems to be a valid way to capture their behavior.</p>

<p>Lastly, I chose to study only Life-Like CA. These are the semi-totalistic CA rules that only depend on the Moore neighborhood of each cell. This made the search space something that I could simulate in reasonable time, given that it only had around a quarter million possible rules (even though it still took two weeks to generate all of the data).</p>

<p>The result of these simulations were 262,144 records of the average complexity in bytes of the board of all possible Life-Like CA. Each record had 256 samples, each record was averaged from 10 runs, and each rule was run with a board size of 100x100 cells.</p>

<h2 id="using-umap-a-digital-telescope">Using UMAP, a Digital Telescope</h2>

<p><img src="https://kylehovey.github.io/blog/images/automata_nebula/expository/webb.jpg" alt="James Webb Space Telescope"></p>

<p>Obviously, no one has the time to go through the graphs of over a quarter million samples, so I needed to find a way to classify the results. Recently I have been infatuated with the <a href="https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="blank">UMAP</a> algorithm. It has the ability to compress data with thousands of dimensions into a lower dimensional space (in this case 2D or 3D) while still preserving structures/features in the data. It is a remarkable feat of algebraic topology that deserves more awareness of in the scientific community.</p>

<p>When first learning about dimensionality reduction algorithms such as UMAP or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding" target="blank">tSNE</a>, I was extremely skeptical of their efficacy. It seemed impossible to retain structure when losing that many dimensions. What made their usage click for me was the knowledge that, even if your data lives in a space that has thousands of dimensions (called the ambient space), there is a very good chance that the <em>local dimension</em> of real-world data is of much lower dimension than this. The goal, then, of UMAP is to preserve the structure found in the data by finding a good manifold to embed it into. For further understanding on this topic, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq6iPZVUxZU" target="blank">presentation</a> that Leland McInnes (the creator of UMAP) gave on his algorithm.</p>

<p>In a sense, UMAP is a digital telescope that lets us look at constellations of high-dimensional data that we have never had the ability to visualize before. Algorithms like tSNE have worked in similar ways in the past, but UMAP is the first algorithm to be efficient enough to run on data with thousands of dimensions using something as prosaic as a laptop and a dream. This is to say that UMAP scales incredibly well, especially when compared to what is already out there.</p>

<p>Armed with UMAP, I fed the algorithm all 262,144 vectors (each with 256 dimensions, one for each complexity snapshot) and patiently waited for the embedding to complete. After fifteen minutes of my laptop revving up my fans, I had my first snapshot of the overarching structure of the Life-Like CA (points are colored by the average forward difference between each complexity snapshot):</p>

<p><a href="https://kylehovey.github.io/blog/images/automata_nebula/plots/selected_run/UMAP_CA_Full_High_Res.png" download="">(High-Res Version)</a></p>

<p>There it was, the massive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell_diagram" target="blank">Hertzspring-Russel</a>esque serpent hiding in the structure of emergent complexity in automata. It is important to note that compressing dimensions can make parts of the data look separate in the embedding, even though they are connected in the ambient space they came from. It would be reasonable to assume that the serpent is one continuous entity, and the “jump” in the center was a result of the embedding.</p>

<p>While beautiful, this representation would not mean much if it did not accomplish the goal we set out to achieve: a metric for classification of rules that behave in similar ways to a given starting rule. Starting from the Game of Life, I began examining nearby rules and found that the metric did indeed yield other rules that produced uncanny behavior.</p>

<p>What is fascinating about this embedding is that it extends the idea of Stephen Wolfram’s four-level classification of CA to a continuum that can be embedded in as many dimensions as you see fit. CA classically known for supporting persistent structures and gliders such as Game of Life, Day and Night, and High Life exist in the middle of the serpent where the average difference is on the edge of chaos. CA that burn through complexity at a higher rate such as Morley, Anneal, and Diamoeba are far out on the tail of the serpent, along with many rules that result in universes that either die out quickly or fill the whole board with live cells (two low-complexity attractors). Meanwhile, rules like Replicator (which duplicates existing structure) exist in the head of the serpent where complexity stays roughly the same throughout the generations. Rules at the head seem to tend very quickly towards chaos, an apt opposite to the rules found in the tail.</p>

<p>
I needed an idea for the covers of the series of books that I'm writing,
<a href="https://aiprobook.com/"><i>Interactive Programming for Artificial Intelligence</i></a>.
</p>

<p>
My budget was (close to) zero, and I can't call myself an artist. Many ideas came
and went; none of them were distinctive enough. They weren't communicating the
message of the book series.
</p>

<p>
The main message of the book series? These aren't just
tutorials teaching some contemporary programming skills. I hope they are
much more than that!
</p>

<p>
This book series has an <i>interactive</i> approach. Every concept I'm writing
about is immediately illustrated with executable code. You can try it right away
in Clojure's amazing super-console: <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/repl/introduction">the REPL</a>, which provides a genuine connection between
the programmer and the running program.
</p>

<p>
These are <i>programming</i> books. They go beyond theory, and they do not stop
at cute demos. The code you'll write is fast, flexible and extendable.
The real thing. Comprehensive, but approachable.
</p>

<p>
Not all of the books are strictly about <i>Artificial Intelligence</i>,
they are also about the programming foundations that are important
in building AI software.
</p>

<p>
These are several challenging areas on their own. Math: it's tough. AI: it's abstract.
Functional programming: it's funky. High performance computing on the GPU: get out of here!
Together? It's a tough sell!
</p>

<p>
Finally though, the answer fell into my lap. Meet Dog and Bird, they are two friends
that bravely immerse themselves into challenging activities and make them effortless and fun!
</p>

<p>
These books are great for beginners. It's not easy, but everything is simply explained.
You don't have to be an expert to start, but you will become one as you progress.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>There are a lot of books in the world. How do you choose which ones to read?</p><p>There are at least two questions here:</p><ul><li>What topics should I read about?</li><li>What books do I read within a topic?</li></ul><p>For some people, the answer to the topic question is easy. They're obsessed with a given topic. They move onto the second problem.</p><p>For others, like myself, the first can be daunting. It's not that there aren't enough topics, it's that there are too many. If I look at my Goodreads want to read list right now, I see books on the following:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1138264.Mathematical_Models_of_Social_Evolution">Mathematical models of social evolution</a></li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/256965.Six_Myths_about_the_Good_Life">Philosophical views on the good life</a></li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49930783-why-we-re-polarized">Political polarisation in the US</a></li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/178447.Leaders">Nixon's take on different state leaders</a></li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23582015-principles-of-neural-design">Neuroscience and neural design</a></li></ul><p>Each of these topics seem great and the books seemed good enough to justify saving. I have 176 more on my list. A friend just emailed me about<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Liberalism-Failed-Politics-Culture/dp/0300223447"> Why Liberalism Failed</a> and it turns out that book looks interesting as well. How to choose?</p><p>This post is about modeling my reading engine. It's about reading for insight, reading to uncover valuable and relevant information and skills. There are other reasons to read, like to relax or for social reasons. They can be related, but I'm largely going to ignore those reasons here. This may come across as utilitarian and boring, but that's the cost of being serious.</p><p>Let's step back and consider what kind of decision is at stake here. Decisions can vary on the following dimensions:</p><ul><li>reversibility</li><li>stakes</li><li>prior uncertainty</li><li>post certainty</li></ul><p>When decisions are irreversible, you'll want to ensure that you take the correct one. So you'll spend more time on the decision. If they are reversible and you learn you made the wrong decision, no problem, you can change. Choosing between job offers is the sort of thing you'll likely want to spend a decent amount of time on. The switching costs are usually high. If you want a better example, consider the decision of whether to have a kid or not.</p><p>If decisions are high stakes, deciding correctly matters more. Not so much if they're smaller potatoes. Spend more time on choosing a job, less time on what to watch this evening.</p><p>If decisions are made in a shroud of uncertainty, then the value of additional information will be higher. Prior uncertainty refers to the amount of uncertainty before a given decision. Often, "When it comes to perceiving reality, our minds are in a fog."</p><p>Post certainty refers to the amount and rate of relevant information flow after making a decision. That's a bit abstract, but we all know that after some decisions, you'll know right away whether you made the right one. Ordering at some restaurants is like this. After other decisions, such as longer term investments, you may never know. To be more precise, a decision will be higher in post certainty to the degree that, after you make the decision, you get relevant information and you get that information quickly.</p><p>With these in mind we can see that the decision to read on a particular topic is:</p><ul><li>reversible</li><li>medium stakes</li><li>variable prior uncertainty</li><li>reasonable post certainty</li></ul><p>The decision is reversible because you can stop reading at any point. Reading is somewhat important (it depends), but not as high stakes as many decisions we make. There can initially be a lot of prior uncertainty, ideally this goes down over a life. Occasionally, the result of a decision won't be evaluable for years, for example, when it's tied up with a risky research project. An example of this is deciding to become an expert in nanotech in the early 2000s. Yet if you know that you want to take a bet on high risk, world shaping technological developments then, by asking the right questions, you'll be able to reduce uncertainty. Given that you're studying nanotech, you can evaluate whether you're studying the right issues within that domain. You can do all of this even if the decision to study nanotech won't be evaluable for years.</p><p>So choosing what domains to hop into is reversible, medium stakes, has variable uncertainty, and has a reasonable amount of post certainty.</p><p>There are two key upshots here:</p><ul><li>First, what you read is determined by your projects. If you're uncertain about your projects, that uncertainty will trickle down. When I was studying philosophy, learning software engineering, or heads down in<a href="http://stoameditation.com/"> Stoa</a> I had less uncertainty about what to read. If I'm exploring different projects, there's more uncertainty.</li><li>The second, is that deciding what to read is a game you'll play over and over again. It's a reversible decision that you can get better at.</li></ul><p>What you want to think of doing then, is designing a reading engine. You're not making one-off judgements about what to read for all time. Instead, you're setting up a system for selecting, consuming, and then utilizing information. Books play a small role in that ecosystem - they're not even the primary unit.</p><h3 id="building-a-reading-engine">Building A Reading Engine</h3><p>This engine can be modeled as a pipeline:<br></p><figure><img src="https://www.calebontiveros.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-16-at-7.47.11-AM.png"><figcaption>Created with <em><a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>'s </em>nascent <em>diagram tool.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Reading is the core activity. But it's interwoven with a number of other activities.</p><p>What I read is influenced by what I've collected into my reserves, projects, the questions I'm asking, and curiosity.</p><p><strong>Reserves</strong><br>The reserves is a list of books that I found intriguing at one point or another. It isn't a list of books to read. That seems too prescriptive - I won't read every book in my reserve. Instead, it's a list of books that I may read, if I get excited about the relevant topic. The books are on deck, as it were.</p><p>Some of my favorite ways to populate my reserves is through interviews, blog posts, conversations, and Twitter. I usually find the best pieces at the end of bibliographies or during a simple search.</p><p><strong>Projects</strong><br>The most influential driver of this pipeline is projects. I like to think of my life as organized around a few projects or goals. Some of these are mundane, others grand. Whatever they are, they should guide what you read. If you're looking for insight, that's in the purpose of something or other. Examples of projects are:</p><ul><li>Building better habits</li><li>Learning about formal methods in cultural evolution</li><li>Aiming to be more Stoic</li><li>Cooking more varied dishes</li><li>Running a reading group on power and influence in organizations</li></ul><p>As noted above, uncertainty about your projects trickles down. If it seems like there are too many things to read, that may be a sign that you have too many projects.</p><p>If this is you, you can let your work inform whether they should get dropped or not. If you want to cull projects more aggressively, <a href="https://www.calebontiveros.com/on-disproving-your-own-ideas/">derisk</a> and<a href="https://effectivealtruismcoaching.com/blog/2020/6/26/five-ways-to-prioritize-better"> prioritize</a>. Focus on questions like:</p><ul><li>What can I learn that would make this project not matter to me?</li><li>What cheap tests would show that this project won't work?</li><li>Can I build an MVP of this project?</li><li>What specific questions about this topic do I want answered? What would answers unlock?</li></ul><p><strong>Questions</strong><br>Projects are vague and not sufficient for narrowing down the solution set on their own. Instead, list questions that you want answers to. If reading is inquiry guided, you're more likely to find what you want and spend less time trawling through books that feel relevant, but aren't.</p><p>Questions can help you choose the right things to read. What you decide to spend your attention on is a reversible decision. You can stop reading at any moment. So, if, like me, you feel like there are too many topics, narrow it by answering questions like:</p><ul><li>What's the chance that this topic is related to my project?</li><li>If I understand this completely, how will that be helpful in advancing my project?</li><li>How long will it take you to understand this topic? Is it worth the cost?</li></ul><p>Think of reading as inquiry guided. Your questions are the fundamental units. Read in order to answer specific queries you have. Once you've answered a question, that should generate more questions and output. If you can't find the answer, put the book down.</p><p>As an example, I want to read the book on neural design, because I'm interested in the nature of emotion. Often I feel like I read neuroscientific explanations of behavior and they don't feel like explanations at all. On the surface, they appear to be very black box (x module is linked with this behavior). Plausibly, explaining how the brain works from an engineering perspective is more illuminating. So, if I read that book then I should come into with the questions:</p><ul><li>Does this book give a new kind of explanation?</li><li>Is this explanation useful to understanding the nature of emotion?</li></ul><p>I can likely figure this out pretty quickly. If the answer is no, I can stop reading. Returning to the framework above, reading has reasonably high post certainty. As you read, you can get a sense of whether you're reading the right thing by updating on the book’s quality and whether it has what you want in it.</p><div><p>As an aside answers to these questions are things that should end up in notes. And if the answers help me push the peanut forward, they'll influence other questions, an essay, or project.</p><p><strong>Output</strong><br>Your project likely has some private or public output.</p></div><p>For me the private output is in the form of anki cards and notes.<a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/"> Anki</a> is a fun and useful way to remember things. A lot of people are excited about note taking systems and software today. The most important part about notes is that they actually answer the questions that you have.</p><p>Public output can be anything from behavior change to essays, from conversations in person to email. Putting things out there will help you get feedback, speed up your projects, ask better questions, and provide value to others.<br></p><p><strong>Occurrent Curiosity</strong><br>Not all things should be so structured. Plausibly some amount of reading shouldn't fit that tightly into your system. You're more likely to discover something neglected if you read things for the sake of reading them on occasion.</p><p>Sometimes it's fun to read something because you're curious about it at that very moment. This is less systematic but I think that occurrent curiosity plays an important role in choosing what topics to read on. For me, it serves to explore books that may not be directly related to a project of mine, but could be …</p></section></div>

<p>How many times have you heard someone say they are data-driven or data centric or that “data is the heart of everything they do”? I’ve heard this so many times that the urge to wince is becoming irresistible. This sentiment is emblematic of a vanity that exists in the big data era – we are scientific, evidence based and use data to make our decisions.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This slogan is heard at every company I’ve worked at and from a range of people whether they be CEOs or “thought leaders”. In this post, I want to explain why we’re not as data-driven as we’d like to think. There are mistakes I’ve noticed some otherwise very smart people make when it comes to looking at and making decisions based on data and I want to discuss some of them with the hopes of injecting some humility and skepticism into the discourse.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Before I begin, let me give the benefit of the doubt to those people who express this sentiment earnestly. I’m aware that people are well intentioned when they say this – they want to express the fact that they’re not exclusively guided by their experience, hearsay or whim when making decisions. They want to consider facts from the outside world and let this guide their thought process about a particular issue. As far as this goes – fine, but I contend that this sentiment is so general and fair-seeming that it goes without saying. Not many people would openly admit that they don’t like to consider the facts before making a decision.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>I would go further and say those people who frequently want you to know how data savvy or data focused they are, do so as a way of sounding clever and giving legitimacy to whatever it is that they’re about to say next. Whenever someone tells me that they’re data-driven I inevitably lean in to hear what silly comment couched in technical sounding language is going to follow – it has the inverse effect that the author intended.<br></p>



<p>Let’s explore some of the common blunders made by data-driven decision makers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>No one has ever let data speak for itself – ever</h2>



<p>If a data tree falls in a (random?) forest, does it make a sound? Easy – no. This is an error I see made by non technical people or those who come from non scientific fields and love the idea of objective and bias free analysis. Too bad no one has ever done that in data science. Data cannot speak without an interpreter and that interpreter is always mischievous, seeking to mix in its own words.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>All data have assumptions and biases. Where we get our data from, the quality of our data and how we use the data for analysis all imbue data with a structure of which we have to be mindful. Even activities as simple as looking at a line graph carry assumptions that can trip us up if unchecked. There could be missing data, the time scale could not be homogeneous (have we skipped days?) or the data recorded could change scale halfway through. Even choosing which range of values on the x and y axis to show will have an impact on the user. These assumptions must be considered and made explicit if it is feared that they could mislead the end user. If not feared – do it all the same.</p>



<h2>Where your data comes from is as important as how much data you have</h2>



<p>The sad truth is that in practice, most of the data we have as data scientists is junk. Choosing what to ignore is important for meaningful analysis. More data does not equate to better analysis – especially if it comes from a source which is biased and unreliable, Garbage In Garbage Out.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>I was once asked to model how some process evolves over time. The problem was that each data point was not measuring the same unit; our observation of some phenomena at time epoch 2 was not the observation of the same phenomena at time epoch 1. Therefore you were not measuring evolution of anything over time but rather making statements about independent data on different days. To illustrate this, consider the problem of measuring daily occupancy in a hotel – we count the number of guests in rooms every day and plot. However if we had daily occupancy data but each day reports a different hotel, then we cannot reasonably plot this on a (time indexed line) graph since we would not be looking at the occupancy rate of the same hotel over time.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This distinction is important and fundamentally shifts the robustness of our whole analysis. We have to interrogate carefully where our data comes from, what biases it might have and whether it is in the format we need to test our hypotheses.</p>



<h2>Just being skeptical doesn’t make you smart</h2>



<p>It is true that confirmation bias is real and there are many trigger-happy stakeholders who will make decisions based on one significant test in a sea of other non significant results (my views on significance testing in business might be in a different post). It pays dividends to be careful, demand more data and adopt a wait-and-see approach. A lot of times we build models and make predictions and the best thing to do is to wait for more data once we feel like we have effectively modelled a problem.<br></p>



<p>However there are people who sit on the other extreme and no amount of analysis is sufficient for them to act. They try to show how level-headed they are by making comments like “we need other data sources to better understand the problem”, “we need to synthesise our data to separate signal from noise” or “the data is out of date”. All these remarks are reasonable but in many cases they’re used as a justification for inaction.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The purpose of data work and experimentation should be to inform action. If you are hiding behind these excuses to not make changes which seem otherwise reasonable then you’re not being cautious, you’re being cowardly. If you don’t have a measurable limit of how much data will be enough for you to act (how this is determined is a different problem) or how you intend to separate signal from noise then you’re making this mistake.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>It’s a tricky blunder to spot because it disguises itself as wisdom. If data analysis is used to repeatedly say no because stakeholders see no evidence that an action will be successful, they should go the whole way and not take any action – there is never going to be evidence of efficacy until after the fact. One telltale sign of this behaviour is how people conveniently depend on less data when there is a decision they want to make already. The criterion of evidence for ideas they dislike is far higher compared to the ideas they are favourable towards.</p>



<h2>Automation is not a substitute for thinking</h2>



<p>When you write code it helps to automate as much as possible. Putting models in production or scheduling scripts are very powerful tools which ultimately save time and effort. However there is a danger when we try to automate those decisions which require a domain specific understanding of a problem.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Natural Language Processing is full of problems which require a human to determine if the results make sense – from interpreting word2vec similarity outputs to validating the sensibility of text cleaning, there are some problems which require humans in the loop (for the time being). We can make the space for those humans small but we can’t fully automate it away at the risk of making our analysis meaningless. Clustering is another example where we can automate to a great extent but if the output does not make sense for the problem in question, it might be necessary to compromise on some performance metrics in order to gain interpretability.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>If it helps, I’ve formulated Junaid’s 1st law “Automate as far as possible, but not further”.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Sometimes it’s okay to ignore the data</h2>



<p>Sometimes it helps to take a risk and ignore what the data might be presently suggesting and go with your instinct. Frequent A/B testing can sometimes lead to users chasing local optima and not focusing on the big picture. If you gambled on a new product feature and early results have shown that users respond adversely, it might not necessarily be the case that it is good to discontinue it. Think about other benefits it might have for your business and users later down the line. It might be that after users have gotten used to the new feature, they begin to respond positively.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Ultimately there is nothing wrong with using intuition sometimes. The problem arises when we confuse our intuition as inference from data and behave with a false confidence. I have seen people deliberately masquerade their opinions as if they were inferences from data analysis and refuse to acknowledge that their views originate from their minds vs the external world. We should admit when we’re using our intuition and be open to being challenged if others have differing ideas.<br></p>



<p>There are more data sins but these are the main ones that come to mind. Hopefully I’ve illustrated the value of thinking through what we’re doing, checking our assumptions and realising that this enterprise is far more complicated than the buzzwords and slogans would have us believe.&nbsp;</p>

    <h2> Simplified view on How Certificate Signing works </h2>

<h4 id="steps-for-signing-certificate-by-ca">Steps for signing certificate by CA</h4>
<ol>
<li>The Subscriber (the person asking a CA to issue them a certificate) sends a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to the CA which contains all of their details like name, domain name etc.</li>
<li>The CA will then take a blank certificate and begins to fill in the details of the Subscriber, validating ownership of the domain along the way, until they have completed all of the fields in the certificate.</li>
<li>At this stage we have what we call the Pre-Certificate, it’s basically a finished certificate ready to issue but the only thing that’s missing is the CAs signature on the bottom of the certificate to make it official</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="signing-of-certificate">Signing of certificate</h4>
<ol start="4">
<li>CA takes Pre-Certificate and running it through a hash function, currently SHA256, to obtain the digest.</li>
<li>The second step is the CA then taking that digest and encrypting it with their private key.</li>
<li>This encrypted digest is the signature and once appended to the end of the file we now have a signed certificate that can be issued to the Subscriber.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Rules public key encryption</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>For every private key, there is only one corresponding public key.</li>
<li>Also Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with it’s corresponding private key, and data encrypted with the private key can only be decrypted with it’s corresponding public key.</li>
<li>More rules and info at: <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/">https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/</a></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Q: How does adding the <strong>encrypted digest</strong> i.e. signature makes it signed certificate ?</p>
<p>A: It can better be explained by putting browser in picture and looking at what it does while requesting https website.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="what-browser-does">What browser does</h4>
<ol>
<li>During tls handshake with https endpoint, it fetches associate intermediate certificate and root certificate.
<ul>
<li>We need to upload intermediate certificate(public key of CA) and root certificate while uploading ssl certificate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Browser now decrypts the digest using intermediate certificates, if it is able to decrypt using intermediate key, it means that above certificate is signed by private-key of CA(data encrypted with the private key can only be decrypted with it’s corresponding public key)</li>
<li>Browser itself also calculate hash of pre-certificate to compare with hash it got in step 2 after decrypting digest.</li>
<li>If both are correct means,
<ul>
<li>The signature definitely came from the CA. (Authenticity) - Step 2</li>
<li>The certificate has not been tampered with. (Integrity)  - Step 3</li>
</ul>
</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><span>Writing your resume for the first time or editing it for the 100th can both be incredibly daunting experiences. </span></p>
<p><span>With todayâ€™s fast-paced, ever-evolving corporate environment, hiring managers are consistently searching for unique candidates in an oversaturated market. </span></p>
<p><span>This makes resume writing so much more integral to landing a job that you want. </span><span>Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Most hiring managers utilize applications called â€œApplicant Tracking Systems (ATS),â€� which help electronically filter through candidate resumes searching for keywords, required skills, and overall competency. </span></p>
<p><span>For example, if a job required Slack as a hard skill, and you fail to mention your proficiency within your resume, your resume will automatically be sorted out of potential applicants immediately. </span></p>
<p><span>That being said, making a point to highlight your skills effectively is essential to passing through the ATS successfully. </span><span>Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Keep in mind that hiring managers are sent hundreds to thousands of resumes per job advertisement. After making it through the ATS, your resume will have approximately 6-8 seconds to prove your worth. </span></p>
<p><span>This means that you should ensure it looks professional and highlights the key information in bite-size pieces for quick reading and digestion. Your goal is to provide information and make the hiring process as painless as possible for the employer. </span></p>
<p><span>The following part of this article will walk you through several suggestions to better your skills section so that it will pass inspection and highlights you as a strong and capable candidate for the jobs you are applying. </span></p>
<p><span>These suggestions are: (1) Do not list given skills, (2) Spotlight key skills, and (3) Highlight your knowledge by separating hard and soft skills. </span></p>
<p><span>By incorporating these 3 modifications to your resume, youâ€™ve already created a great start to passing through the ATS and getting the hiring managersâ€™ attention. </span></p>
<h2><span>Tip #1: Do not list given skills</span></h2>
<p><span>Itâ€™s in our nature to want to name each and every skill we have in order to show that we are qualified, if not overqualified, candidates. Though this approach worked in the past, now itâ€™s more necessary to omit skills that would be assumed. </span></p>
<p><span>For example, previously it was necessary to indicate proficiency with technical skills including Microsoft Office and Google, however, now it seems redundant. In todayâ€™s technical climate, it is assumed that all applicants applying for positions have these commonplace skills. </span></p>
<p><span>Keep in mind that your goal of listing skills is to showcase your attributes, not bog down the hiring manager with information they already assume to know. </span></p>
<h2><span>Tip #2: Spotlight â€œkeyâ€� skills</span></h2>
<p><span>The next suggestion is to spotlight â€œkeyâ€� skills on each resume. This means that when applying to multiple jobs, ensure that you are adjusting your skills section based on the needs of the individual job. </span></p>
<p><span>Itâ€™s a great idea to use keywords and specific skills from the job description itself. If a requirement or specific responsibility is listed or has an apparent theme throughout the job description, use your skill section to highlight your ability to accomplish those tasks. </span></p>
<p><span>An effective way of doing this would be to rephrase their needs into your own voice and then adding that to your resume. For example, if the job description stated, â€œa strong background in CRM systems,â€� you could add, â€œProficient with CRM system,â€� within your skills section. </span></p>
<p><span>However, avoid copying and pasting only the skills outlined in the job description, as this could be seen as unimaginative and hurt your chances of candidacy. </span></p>
<h2><span>Tip #3: Emphasize the difference between soft skills and hard skills.</span></h2>
<p><span>Previously, it was simple to add a single skills section and be content with your resume. Now, it is necessary to emphasize both hard and soft skills. </span></p>
<p><span>Hard and soft skills are equally important to create a compelling resume. An ideal way to include both skills is to create two separate lists. This allows for a hiring manager to easily read through both skillsets. </span></p>
<p><span>Remember, you have 6-8 seconds to convince the hiring manager that youâ€™re a worthy candidate for the job. </span></p>
<p><span>In order to ensure balance across your resume, try to keep the number of skills on each list the same. For example, if you have 5 hard skills, ensure that you have 5 soft skills too. </span></p>
<h2><span>In Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>This article highlights 3 suggestions that you can incorporate into your skill section to make your resume stand out from others.</p>
<p>This includes: (1) do not list given or assumed skills, (2) take time to spotlight â€œkeyâ€� skills, especially those that are discussed within the job description, and (3) emphasize the difference between your hard and soft skills by giving each their own section.</p>

<![CDATA[‘Strong Opinions, Weakly Held’ Doesn't Work That Well]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <p>There’s a famous thinking framework by ‘futurist’, ‘forecaster’, and scenario consultant Paul Saffo called ‘strong opinions, weakly held’. The phrase itself became popular in tech circles in the 2010s — I remember reading about it on Hacker News or a16z.com or one of those thinky tech blogs around the period. It’s still rather popular today.</p><p>Saffo’s framework — laid out in his original <a href="https://www.saffo.com/02008/07/26/strong-opinions-weakly-held/">2008 blog post</a> — goes like this:</p><blockquote>I have found that the fastest way to an effective forecast is often through a sequence of lousy forecasts. Instead of withholding judgment until an exhaustive search for data is complete, I will force myself to make a tentative forecast based on the information available, and then systematically tear it apart, using the insights gained to guide my search for further indicators and information. Iterate the process a few times, and it is surprising how quickly one can get to a useful forecast.<p>Since the mid-1980s, my mantra for this process is “strong opinions, weakly held.” Allow your intuition to guide you to a conclusion, no matter how imperfect — this is the “strong opinion” part. Then – and this is the “weakly held” part – prove yourself wrong. Engage in creative doubt. Look for information that doesn’t fit, or indicators that pointing in an entirely different direction. Eventually your intuition will kick in and a new hypothesis will emerge out of the rubble, ready to be ruthlessly torn apart once again. You will be surprised by how quickly the sequence of faulty forecasts will deliver you to a useful result.</p><p>This process is equally useful for evaluating an already-final forecast in the face of new information. It sensitizes one to the weak signals of changes coming over the horizon and keeps the hapless forecaster from becoming so attached to their model that reality intrudes too late to make a difference.</p><p>More generally, “strong opinions weakly held” is often a useful default perspective to adopt in the face of any issue fraught with high levels of uncertainty, whether one is venturing a forecast or not. Try it at a cocktail party the next time a controversial topic comes up; it is an elegant way to discover new insights — and duck that tedious bore who loudly knows nothing but won’t change their mind!</p></blockquote><p>On the face of it, it all sounds very reasonable and smart. And ‘strong opinions weakly held’ is such a catchy phrase — which probably explains its popularity.</p><p>The only problem with it is that it doesn’t seem to work that well.</p><h2 id="swimming-upstream-against-the-architecture-of-the-mind">Swimming Upstream Against the Architecture Of The Mind</h2><p>How do I know that it doesn’t work that well? I know this because I’ve tried. I tried to use Saffo’s framework in the years between 2013 and 2016, and when I was running my previous company I attempted it with my boss, whenever we convened to <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/what-uncertainty-feels-like/">discuss company strategy</a>.</p><p>Eventually I read Phillip Tetlock’s <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-forecasting-series/"><em>Superforecasting</em></a>, and then I gave up on ‘Strong Opinions, Weakly Held’.</p><p>Why does the framework not work very well? From experience, Saffo’s approach fails in two ways.</p><p>The first way is if the person <em>hasn’t</em> read Saffo’s original post. This is, to be fair, most of us — Saffo’s original idea is so quotable it has turned into a memetic phenomenon, and I’ve seen it cited in fields far outside tech. In such cases, the failure mode is that ‘Strong Opinions, Weakly Held’ turns into ‘Strong Opinions, Justified Loudly, Until Evidence Indicates Otherwise, At Which Point You Invoke It To Protect Your Ass.’</p><p>In simpler terms, ‘strong opinions, weakly held’ sometimes becomes a license to hold on to a bad opinion strongly, with downside protection, against the spirit and intent of Saffo’s original framework.</p><p>Now, you might say that this is through no fault of Saffo’s, and is instead the problem of popularity. But my response is that if an idea has certain affordances, and people seem to always grab onto those affordances and abuse the idea in the exact same ways, then <em>perhaps you shouldn’t use the idea in the first place.</em> This is especially true — as we’re about to see — if there are better ideas out there.</p><p>The second form of failure is if the person has taken the time to look up the original intention of the phrase. In this situation, the failure mode is when you attempt to integrate new information into your judgment. Saffo’s framework offers no way for us to do this.</p><p>Here’s an example. Let’s say that you’ve decided, along with your boss, to build a particular type of product for a particular subsection of the self-service checkout market. You both come to the opinion that this subsection is the best entry-point to the industry: it is relatively lucrative, and you think that it is the easiest customer segment to service.</p><p>What happens to your opinion when you <em>slowly</em> discover that the subsegment is overcrowded? Of course, you don’t find out immediately — what happens instead is that you spot little hints, spread over the course of a couple of months, that many competitors are entering the market at the same time. These are tiny things like competitor brochures lying in the corner table of a client’s office, or pronouncements by industry groups that “they are looking to engage vendors for large deployments”, and then much later, clearer evidence in the form of increased competition in deals.</p><p>“Well,” I can hear you say, “‘Strong opinions weakly held’ means that you should change your opinion when you encounter these tiny hints!”</p><p>But at which point do you change your mind? At which point do you switch away from your strong opinion? At which point do you think that it’s time to reconsider your approach?</p><p>The problem, of course, is that <em>this is not how the human brain works.</em></p><p>Both forms of failure stem from the same tension. It’s easy to have strong opinions and hold on to them strongly. It’s easy to have weak opinions and hold on to them weakly. But it is quite difficult for the human mind to vacillate between one strong opinion to another.</p><p>I don’t mean to say that people <em>can’t</em> do this — only that it is very difficult to do so. For instance, Steve Jobs was famous for arguing against one position or another, only to decide that you were right, and then come back a month later holding exactly your opinion, as if it were his all along.</p><p>But most people aren’t like Jobs. Psychologist Amos Tversky used to joke that by default, human brains fall back to “yes I believe that, no I don’t believe that, and maybe” — a three-dial setting when it comes to uncertainty. People then hold on to their opinion for as long as their internal narratives allow them to. Saffo’s thinking framework implies that you sit in ‘yes I believe that’ territory, and then rapidly switch away to ‘maybe’ or to ‘no’, depending on the information you receive.</p><p>Perhaps you may — like Jobs! — be able to do this. But if you are like most people, the attempt will feel a lot like whiplash.</p><p>So, you might ask, what to do instead?</p><h2 id="use-probability-as-an-expression-of-confidence">Use Probability as an Expression of Confidence</h2><p>The gentler answer lies in <em>Superforecasting.</em> In the book, Tetlock presents an analytical framework that is easier to use than Saffo’s, while achieving many of the same goals.</p><ol><li>When forming an opinion, phrase it in a way that is very clear, and may be verified by a particular date.</li><li>Then state the probability you are confident that it is correct.</li></ol><p>For instance, you may say “I believe that Tesla will go bankrupt by 31 December 2021, and I am about 76% confident that this is the case.” Or you can be slightly sloppier with the technique — with my boss, I would say: “I think this subsegment is a good market to enter, and I think we would know if this is true within four months. I believe this on the order of 70% ish. Let’s check back in September.”</p><p>(My boss was an ex-investment banker, so he took to this like a duck to water.)</p><p>Tetlock’s stated technique was developed in the context of a geopolitical forecasting tournament called the Good Judgment Project. In 2016, when I read <em>Superforecasting</em> for the first time, I remember thinking that geopolitical forecasting wasn’t particularly relevant to my job running an engineering office in Vietnam. But I also glommed onto the book’s <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/how-the-superforecasters-do-it/">ideas around analysis</a>, because it was too attractive to ignore.</p><p>The truth is that Tetlock’s ideas are not unique to his research group. Annie Duke’s <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35957157-thinking-in-bets">Thinking in Bets</a></em> proposes the same approach, but drawn from poker, and the ‘rationalist’ community <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/">LessWrong</a> has long-held norms around stating the confidence of their opinions.</p><p>More importantly, Duke and LessWrong have both discovered that the <em>fastest</em> way to provoke such nuanced thinking is to ask: “Are you willing to bet on that? What odds would you take, and how much?”</p><p>You’d be surprised by how effective this question is.</p><p>Why is it so effective? Why does it succeed where ‘Strong Opinions, Weakly Held’ does not?</p><p>The answer lies in the ‘strong opinion’ portion of the phrase. First: by forcing you to state your opinion as a probability judgment — that is, a percentage — you are forced to calibrate the strength of your belief. This makes it easier to move away from it. In other words, you are forced to let go of the ‘yes, no, maybe’ dial in your head.</p><p>Second: by framing it as a bet, you suddenly have skin in the game, and are motivated to get things right.</p><p>Of course, you don’t actually <em>have</em> to bet — you can merely propose the bet as a thinking frame. Later, as new information trickles in, you are allowed to update the % confidence you have in your belief. This allows you to see the world in shades of grey; it also allows you to communicate that confidence to those around you.</p><h2 id="revisiting-the-hierarchy-of-practical-evidence">Revisiting The Hierarchy of Practical Evidence</h2><p>I have one final point to make about this approach.</p><p>Long term readers of this blog would know that my shtick is “apply a technique to my career or to my life, over the period of a couple of months, and report on its efficacy.” Over time, I’ve noticed that techniques are more likely to be effective when they come from believable practitioners. This is what led to my <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-hierarchy-of-practical-evidence/">Hierarchy of Practical Evidence</a>.</p><p>Saffo’s and Tetlock’s …</p></section></div>
