July 25, 2020 | https://www.shreya-shankar.com/new-grad-advice/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.shreya-shankar.com/new-grad-advice/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many people ask me why I chose not to pursue a PhD directly after college. I figured I might as well centralize my thoughts in one place. This essay is for computer science or technical grads:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interested in machine learning</li>
<li>Enjoy working on hard, unsolved technical challenges</li>
<li>Possibly choosing between research or industry</li>
</ul>
<p>As someone who deeply enjoys thinking about and coding solutions to open-ended research questions, I genuinely considered going to a PhD program. To come to a decision, I spent a while pondering why many students with research experience don’t pursue a PhD directly after undergrad. I think there are many reasons why people don’t go directly to PhD programs, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Effort</em>: it’s a lot of work to write applications for many schools, get solid recommendation letters, pay a lot of money in application fees, go through interviews, align with professors, secure funding, and more.</li>
<li><em>Comfort</em>: industry perks and salaries can be more attractive than graduate school stipends and long work hours.</li>
<li><em>Inertia</em>: if you’re not absolutely sure it’s right for you, the thought of switching trajectories midway into the program is very anxiety-provoking.</li>
</ul>
<p>I felt like I could put in the effort to apply and would enjoy a PhD program if I got in, but I still didn’t know what to do. Delaying the decision didn’t feel optimal either, since even if I worked in industry for a few years before going to a PhD program, I didn’t think I’d easily accustom to a large pay cut and working on problem sets again. Understandably, the PhD vs Industry decision caused me a lot of stress! Halfway through my senior year, I wrote down some pros and cons for each choice. In practice, an industry job for me meant working at a startup since I didn’t really enjoy my engineering internships at large companies. </p>
<p>Here, I discuss the raw pros and cons of pursuing a PhD and pros and cons of joining an early-stage machine learning startup. I wrote these in my journal in January 2019, and I provide some relevant commentary from my current self as a machine learning engineer (July 2020) in the nested bullets.</p>
<h2>Pros of pursuing a PhD (immediately after graduating)</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>I can prioritize my curiosity and have the freedom to learn about what I find intellectually engaging.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Now that I’ve been at a startup, although I can still be curious about many things, I have to work on things that provide business value. The ability to not be constrained by industry value is a real pro here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can deeply hone technical expertise and have many people respect me for it.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I’m cringing at how much external validation I used to seek. Being in computer science is playing the <a href="https://nav.al/long-term">long game</a>. You don’t always get external validation, and good work can take a while.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It’s easier to “be my own boss” if I were doing research.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe? Ask a researcher this question. But <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/08/16/how-do-you-work-on-something-important/">choosing what to work on is challenging</a>, regardless of whether you’re in research or engineering.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I actually really enjoy research more than engineering.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes I still feel that I enjoy research more than engineering, but I’ve committed to developing my engineering skills. Again, being in tech is playing the long game, and having good engineering skills will help me no matter where I go, whether it’s research or IC or management.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>There are more clear mentorship opportunities for me.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This is probably true if I went to a PhD program, since I’d have access to many professors and older grad student friends.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can be in a stable career option (5-6 years at least if doing PhD).</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This point occasionally gives me anxiety, since I don’t know exactly where I am going to be for the next 5-6 years. Startups are risky. But I’ve gotten more used to this feeling over the past year. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cons of pursuing a PhD (immediately after graduating)</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Maybe I’m a shitty researcher or will find out that I’m a shitty researcher.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Still a fear of mine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It’s unclear whether I want to end up in academia or industry research, so a PhD could be for nothing.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>One of my math PhD friends explains a PhD as “a socially acceptable reason for screwing around with whatever you’re interested in.” I like this reference, so technically going to a PhD program isn’t a waste if I enjoy it in the process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Incentives in academia are horrible. There are so many major conferences. How do you balance long term gains with getting the publications out?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This is really true. A year ago, I didn’t know how to think long-term. I probably would have tried to maximize my number of papers and burned out in my 3rd year, complaining that I’m not working on anything truly impactful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>A PhD can be really long and hard.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I love Philip Guo’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/15731248-the-ph-d-grind"><em>The PhD Grind</em></a>. Unfortunately he recently took his website down, which hosted the book.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pros of joining an ML startup</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>I can learn how to build things from scratch.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Painfully true — building from scratch is challenging, but the growing pains are necessary to deeply understand productionizing ML. </li>
<li>At the time, I didn’t know about the existence of “real-world” ML and engineering tools such as <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Spark</a>, <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Airflow</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, or <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>. These tools are super relevant and learning them can be its own pro.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can see how research is applied in industry and measure the gap between research and industry.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This gap is larger than I expected. It’s also really fun to apply state-of-the-art research to business cases. For example, we recently productionized a transformer model.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can gain leadership skills from the beginning and be a key figure in recruiting and defining the culture.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I was thrown into the fire as soon as I joined. Now, a year later, I’ve probably done over a hundred technical interviews, led a few ML projects for key clients, and mentored a couple of interns. I would definitely not have gotten this experience at a larger company.</li>
<li>It’s also cool to be able to choose who you work with (to some extent) by hiring people that fit in with the culture you help to define.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can closely work with both experienced engineers and non-technical domain experts.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I have learned so much from every single one of my coworkers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I am relatively immune to any level of risk this early in my career.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This honestly just speaks to my insane privileges of graduating from a top school, having experience at big tech companies, and being a US citizen. I am quite thankful for these things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cons of joining an ML startup</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Possibly being the only woman, potentially for a long time.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Bleh. True. No comment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>This is not the route to maximize expected earnings. I could get paid more at a larger company. Only in the small chance that the startup succeeds will I make a lot of money.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>True, but I now feel like this really isn’t a priority for me. Being in tech gives me the privilege of making a high salary wherever I go, and I think that <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2019628,00.html">as long as I can live comfortably</a> (as I do now), I’m happy. Maybe this will change if I’m trying to buy a house or have a family.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>My technical accomplishments aren’t seen outside the startup.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This is somewhat false. I think there are some people outside my company who respect my technical abilities.</li>
<li>This point also doesn’t really matter too much, since<a href="https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/"> one’s career involves more than just how prolific of a programmer they are.</a> </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I could be overworking myself.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I think this is true of any job. There are always opportunities to work more than you’re expected to. Also, as a new grad, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-mistakes-which-software-engineers-make-in-their-early-years/answer/Edmond-Lau">optimizing for learning rate</a> can feel like overworking oneself, especially in the beginning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>If I don’t care about the specific application, I might not be motivated to do quality work.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Surprisingly, I don’t care too much about cars (my company’s application), but I am really, really motivated to solve the technical challenges my company faces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>My story and decision-making process<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></h2>
<p>Thinking back to the fall of 2018, I remember how stressed I felt drafting my statement of purpose. I’m the kind of person who’s never fully confident in my decisions — there’s always a nagging <em>what if?</em> in my brain. I didn’t feel a magnetic pull towards academia. I also didn’t feel like I was destined to make a huge impact in industry. What does one pursue if they’re just…unsure? I felt this urge to apply to PhD programs — after all, I grew up in a college town, I’m a professor’s daughter, and most of my closest childhood and university friends are in PhD programs.</p>
<p>One of my older friends told me, “If you know what problem you want to solve, then find the place where you’re most likely to help devise a solution.”  <em>Robustness in machine learning models is something only academics are working on</em>, I naively thought at the time. So maybe a PhD was the right move. But as I drafted my statement of purpose, writing about how we needed to construct and solve relevant toy problems because it would be imperative to have safe and robust machine learning models in the real world, it seemed silly to me that I wanted to research this field when I had never actually worked on machine learning in the real world.  What new perspectives could I bring? Why should a school accept me?</p>
<p>My wonderful undergraduate advisor, <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/~hanrahan/">Pat Hanrahan</a>, urged me to consider working in industry for a couple years before going to a PhD program. I didn’t like the suggestion at first — what if I would never end up doing a PhD? “Well, then you’ve saved yourself five or six years! If you don’t want to do a PhD, you’ll find out eventually,” he laughed. </p>
<p>Pat had a point, so I started to look for industry machine learning jobs. Fortunately, since I had significant ML research experience for an undergrad, I could pick between many options. Did I want to do machine learning at a large company? Small company? Focus on a specific vertical?  I thought back to my machine learning project at Facebook, where I wrote a few lines of SQL to use a well-oiled tool called <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/core-data/introducing-fblearner-flow-facebook-s-ai-backbone/">FBLearner</a> to set up a gradient boosting classifier. I thought about machine learning at Google, where engineers write <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43438/">Borg</a> scripts to throw lots of serialized data at one of many models in a zoo. If …</p></div></div>

<p><em>Work-in-progress LVGL GUI Framework ported to Wayland EGL on PinePhone with Ubuntu Touch</em></p>
<p><strong>We ❤️ &nbsp; Old Underwear...</strong></p>
<p>They feel comfy, they fit our contours. Nevermind the holes and the old stains 🤢</p>
<p><strong>X11 is like Old Underwear.</strong> It's been around for 30 years... Yet we still use it in spite of its feature gaps and wonky quirks.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/PinePhone"><strong>PinePhone on Ubuntu Touch feels like... New Underwear.</strong></a></p>
<p>It runs Linux but it has none of the legacy X11 code. Because it's optimised for a great mobile experience with <strong>Wayland.</strong></p>
<p>But New Underwear feels uncomfortable. So today we'll learn Wayland and understand how apps are built with Wayland.</p>
<p>Hopefully someday we'll move on to newer, simpler app frameworks (like <a href="https://lvgl.io/">LVGL</a> and Flutter) as we discard our Old Underwear: X11, SDL, GTK, Qt, ...</p>
<p>The source code for this article may be found here...</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir"><code>github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir</code></a></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X11</a> is the Graphical Display Service that runs on most Linux desktops and notebooks.</p>
<p>Let's hunt for the X11 Service on Pinebook Pro...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-pinebook.png" alt="X11 Service on Pinebook Pro"></p>
<p>That's the X11 Service... A <strong>2.2 MB</strong> executable named <strong><code>Xorg</code></strong>. </p>
<p>The X11 Service controls the rendering of Linux apps (as well as the keyboard and mouse input) like this...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-x11.png" alt="X11 Architecture"></p>
<p>(Adapted from <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/architecture.html">"Wayland Architecture"</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At the top we have the Linux programs running on our Linux machine: <strong>Terminal, Editor, Web Browser</strong>.</p>
<p>Each program renders its graphical display and transmits the raw graphics to the X11 Service (via a local TCP socket).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>X11 Service forwards the rendered graphics to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager"><strong>Window Manager / Compositor</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The Window Manager / Compositor is provided by the <strong>Desktop Environment</strong>: Xfce, KDE, Gnome, ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Window Manager / Compositor wraps the rendered graphics into Display Windows and <strong>"decorates"</strong> them with scrollbars, title bar and minimise / maximise / close buttons.</p>
<p>The Window Manager / Compositor then draws the Display Windows into a <strong>Screen Buffer</strong> according to their screen coordinates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Screen Buffer is rendered to our screen by the X11 Service, talking to the <strong>Linux Display Driver</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any <strong>keyboard and mouse input</strong> is captured by the X11 Service, and forwarded to the programs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Why is X11 so complex? So many hops?</em></p>
<p>Because X11 was designed for Distributed Computing Systems.</p>
<p>Here's how I used (abused?) X11R4 at <a href="http://srg.cs.illinois.edu/">UIUC Systems Research Group</a> way back in 1990 (30 years ago!)...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-uiuc.png" alt="Distributed X11 System"></p>
<p>Thankfully things are a lot simpler now, lemme explain...</p>

<p><em>Do we need overlapping or tiled windows on PinePhone?</em></p>
<p><em>Do we need to need to decorate PinePhone windows with a title bar and minimise / maximise / close buttons?</em></p>
<p><em>Do we even need any windows on PinePhone?</em></p>
<p>No! Because each PinePhone app takes control of the entire screen!</p>
<p>PinePhone uses a simpler Graphical Display Service: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)#Wayland_compositors"><strong>Wayland Compositor</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Let's hunt for the Wayland Compositor on PinePhone...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-compositor.png" alt="Wayland Compositor on PinePhone"></p>
<p>That's the Wayland Compositor... A <strong>262 KB</strong> executable named <code>unity-system-compositor</code>. </p>
<p><em>Compare that with the 2.2 MB X11 Server on Pinebook Pro!</em></p>
<p>Here's how the Wayland Compositor controls apps and touchscreen input on PinePhone with Ubuntu Touch...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-arch.png" alt="Wayland Architecture"></p>
<p>(Adapted from <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/architecture.html">"Wayland Architecture"</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGL_(API)">"EGL API"</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At the top we have the apps running on our phone: <strong>Terminal, Editor, Web Browser</strong>.</p>
<p>Since each app runs fullscreen, only the active app will be rendered.</p>
<p>When then app starts, it queries the <strong>Wayland Compositor</strong> for the graphical display interfaces available. (They talk via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_file_types#Socket">Linux socket file</a>: <code>/run/user/32011/wayland-0</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wayland Compositor returns the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGL_(API)"><strong>EGL Interface</strong></a> to the app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>App calls the EGL Interface to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL"><strong>render OpenGL graphics</strong></a> directly to the <strong>Linux Display Driver</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linux Display Driver forwards the OpenGL rendering commands to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit"><strong>GPU to update the screen</strong></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any <strong>touchscreen input</strong> is captured by the Wayland Compositor, and forwarded to the active app.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Wayland looks so much simpler and faster than X11!</p>
<p><em>Wayland is designed for OpenGL and GPUs?</em></p>
<p>Yes! And I lied about Wayland being New Underwear... Wayland is not really that New!</p>
<p>Wayland was first released in 2008 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)">11 years ago</a>)... Yet it was designed around OpenGL and GPUs, the same tech that powers our beautiful games today. (<a href="https://youtu.be/DNBk9hnPkTY">And websites too</a>)</p>
<p>Read on to learn how to render our own OpenGL graphics with Wayland and Ubuntu Touch on PinePhone...</p>

<p><em>Rendering a yellow rectangle with Wayland and OpenGL on PinePhone</em></p>

<p>Here's the function that calls OpenGL to render the yellow box above: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L44-L60"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>/// Render the OpenGL ES2 display
static void render_display() {
    //  Fill the rectangular region with yellow
    glClearColor(
        1.0,  //  Red

    // Render now
    glFlush();
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>render_display()</code> looks exactly like normal OpenGL, and it works on PinePhone with Wayland! (Thanks to Ubuntu Touch)</p>
<p>Two things to note...</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>PinePhone supports a popular subset of OpenGL, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_ES"><strong>OpenGL for Embedded Systems</strong></a> Version 2.0.</p>
<p>OpenGL ES is optimised for Embedded Devices. It's used by many mobile and console games today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To render OpenGL ES graphics, we need to get the <strong>OpenGL ES Context</strong> and <strong>Window Surface</strong> from Wayland</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Before calling <code>render_display()</code>, we fetch the OpenGL Window Surface from Wayland like so: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L167-L189"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>/// Dimensions of the OpenGL region to be rendered
static int WIDTH  = 480;
static int HEIGHT = 360;

static struct wl_egl_window *egl_window;  //  Wayland EGL Window
static EGLSurface egl_surface;            //  EGL Surface

//  Create the EGL Window and render OpenGL graphics
static void create_window(void) {
    //  Create an EGL Window from a Wayland Surface 
    egl_window = wl_egl_window_create(surface, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
    assert(egl_window != EGL_NO_SURFACE);  //  Failed to create OpenGL Window

    //  Create an OpenGL Window Surface for rendering
    egl_surface = eglCreateWindowSurface(egl_display, egl_conf,
        egl_window, NULL);
    assert(egl_surface != NULL);  //  Failed to create OpenGL Window Surface

    //  Set the current rendering surface
    EGLBoolean madeCurrent = eglMakeCurrent(egl_display, egl_surface,
        egl_surface, egl_context);
    assert(madeCurrent);  //  Failed to set rendering surface

    //  Render the display
    render_display();

    //  Swap the display buffers to make the display visible
    EGLBoolean swappedBuffers = eglSwapBuffers(egl_display, egl_surface);
    assert(swappedBuffers);  //  Failed to swap display buffers
}
</code></pre>
<p>Functions named <code>wl_egl_...</code> are provided by the Wayland EGL Interface.  Functions named <code>egl...</code> come from the cross-platform <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/egl.html#:%7E:text=The%20main%20library%20(%20libEGL%20)%20is,directly%20dispatched%20to%20the%20drivers.">Mesa 3D Graphics Library</a>.</p>
<p><em>EGL vs OpenGL... What's the difference?</em></p>
<p>In Wayland, EGL is the Enabler for OpenGL. </p>
<p>Wayland only understands EGL and it will gladly hand us EGL objects... But it's up to us to transform EGL into OpenGL for rendering.</p>
<p>Thus in the code above, we take a Wayland Surface <code>surface</code> and transform it into an EGL Window <code>egl_window</code>...</p>
<pre><code>//  Create an EGL Window from a Wayland Surface 
egl_window = wl_egl_window_create(surface, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
</code></pre>
<p>Then we create an OpenGL Window Surface <code>egl_surface</code> from that EGL Window...</p>
<pre><code>//  Create an OpenGL Window Surface for rendering
egl_surface = eglCreateWindowSurface(egl_display, egl_conf,
    egl_window, NULL);
</code></pre>
<p>And we begin the OpenGL rendering...</p>
<pre><code>//  Set the current rendering surface
eglMakeCurrent(egl_display, egl_surface,
    egl_surface, egl_context);

//  Render the display
render_display();

//  Swap the display buffers to make the display visible
eglSwapBuffers(egl_display, egl_surface);
</code></pre>
<p>Here's how we create a Wayland Region for OpenGL rendering: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L103-L112"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>static struct wl_region *region;  //  Wayland Region

//  Create the Wayland Region for rendering OpenGL graphics
static void create_opaque_region(void) {
    //  Create a Wayland Region
    region = wl_compositor_create_region(compositor);
    assert(region != NULL);  //  Failed to create EGL Region

    //  Set the dimensions of the Wayland Region
    wl_region_add(region, 0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT);

    //  Add the Region to the Wayland Surface
    wl_surface_set_opaque_region(surface, region);
}
</code></pre>
<p>To learn more about EGL, check out <a href="https://jan.newmarch.name/Wayland/EGL/">"Programming Wayland Clients"</a></p>
<p>The Wayland EGL code in this article was adapted from that document.</p>

<p>Earlier in <code>create_window()</code> we called an <strong>EGL Context</strong> <code>egl_context</code> to render OpenGL graphics.</p>
<p>Here's how we get the EGL Context: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L113-L165"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>/// Wayland EGL Interfaces for OpenGL Rendering
static EGLDisplay egl_display;  //  EGL Display
static EGLConfig  egl_conf;     //  EGL Configuration
static EGLContext egl_context;  //  EGL Context

//  Create the EGL Context for rendering OpenGL graphics
static void init_egl(void) {

        <h3>
About</h3>

<p>
Mathematical Components is the name of a library of formalized mathematics for
the Coq system. It covers a variety of topics, from the theory of basic data
structures (e.g., numbers, lists, finite sets) to advanced results in various
flavors of algebra. This library constitutes the infrastructure for the machine
checked proofs of the Four Color Theorem and of the Odd Order Theorem.
</p>
<p>
The reason of existence of this book is to break down the barriers to entry.
While there are several books around covering the usage of the Coq system and
the theory it is based on, the Mathematical Components library is built in an
unconventional way. As a consequence this book provides a non standard
presentation of Coq, putting upfront the formalization choices and the proof
style that are the pillars of the library.
</p>
<p>
This books targets two classes of public. On one hand newcomers, even the more
mathematical inclined ones, find a soft introduction to the programming
language of Coq, <em>Gallina</em>, and the <em>Ssreflect</em> proof language.
On the other hand accustomed Coq users find a substantial account of the
formalization style that made the Mathematical Components library possible.

<p>
	*** The Urban Archeology Program uncovered basalt slab floors corresponding to an open plaza in the Old Houses of Axayácatl, <em>tlatoani</em> of Tenochtitlan between 1469 and 1481.</p>

<p>
	*** INAH’s archaeological salvage project also detected the remains of the conqueror's dwelling, which later became the headquarters of the first Cabildo of New Spain and of the Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca.</p>

 

<p>
	Within the walls of the Old Houses of Axayácatl some of the most decisive episodes of the conquest of Mexico-Tenochtitlán occurred, such as the death of the <em>tlatoani</em> Moctezuma Xocoyotzin, possibly on June 29, 1520; unexpected outcomes that undermined the relationship between Mexicans and Spaniards and triggered the open confrontation.</p>

<p>
	The most recent discovery made by specialists from the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), of vestiges of that pre-Hispanic palace, and of the remains of a later house built under the orders of Hernán Cortés, with reused materials from the previous Tenochca building, revives the memory of those historical events, five centuries later.</p>

<p>
	Thanks to historical sources, it is no mystery for archaeologists that under the floors of the Nacional Monte de Piedad, one of the most emblematic buildings of Mexico City’s Historic Center, located next to the Metropolitan Cathedral, are the foundations of the Palace of Axayácatl, which functioned as the living quarters of Cortés' entourage upon their arrival in the heart of Tenochtitlan.</p>

<p>
	Over the last two decades, and taking advantage of diverse remodeling projects undertaken in the headquarters of that institution, various INAH experts have found remnants of the former residence of Moctezuma II's father. The most recent discoveries were brought to light during archaeological interventions led by Raúl Barrera Rodríguez and José María García Guerrero, head and collaborator, respectively, of the Urban Archeology Program (PAU).</p>

<p>
	Following an inspection for refurbishments conducted in the northern half of the historic building, PAU personnel carried out an archaeological salvage project between the first days of September 2017 and mid-August 2018, focusing on the main courtyard and an adjacent room. It is noteworthy that the project continues to the present in the post-dig research phase.</p>

<p>
	Excavations resulted in the discovery of numerous basalt slab floors, which must have formed part of an open plaza in the Palace of Axayácatl, the ruler who controlled the destiny of Tenochtitlan between 1469 and 1481.</p>

<p>
	Also, from the early Viceregal period (1521-1620 AD), the remains of a house built by order of Cortés were uncovered. That construction, where the Spanish conqueror resided for several years, would also become the seat of the first Cabildo of New Spain (around 1525) and of the Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca, granted to the conqueror four years later.</p>

<p>
	<strong>The archaeological investigation</strong></p>

<p>
	As an exciting part of the public outreach program "Contigo en la Distancia” (“With you from a Distance”), from the Ministry of Culture, the head of the PAU, Raúl Barrera, and his collaborator José María García, explain that they dug 12 test pits - 2 meters per side and 1.50 m deep— around the main courtyard of the National Monte de Piedad, where remodeling work was being carried out to reinforce the columns that define the structure and support the first level of the building.</p>

<p>
	By excavating a series of test pits, on the north, east and west sides, the remains of a stone masonry wall - 1.50 meters high by 1.25 m wide - were uncovered. This wall served as a foundation and basal platform for a series of columns of the building erected around 1755, which allows us to deduce that the central courtyard was originally larger. Also, in the west section of this same space were found the subflooring: basal portions and a shaft of other columns from the early Viceregal period.</p>

<p>
	However, major surprises awaited in the adjacent room. PAU archaeologists had the opportunity to conduct an extensive excavation, which allowed them to locate the remains of a room made of basalt and <em>tezontle </em>(vesicular lava) dressed stones - 5 by 4 meters -, whose base sat upon a floor of basalt slabs. Further analyses led to the conclusion that this was the home of Hernán Cortés, once Mexico-Tenochtitlan fell in 1521.</p>

<p>
	Below the subflooring of the house of Cortés, more than 3 meters deep, the remains of another floor of basalt slabs, but from pre-Hispanic times, were detected. Given its characteristics, the specialists deduced that it was part of an open space in the former Palace of Axayácatl, probably a courtyard.</p>

<p>
	Barrera and García emphasize that the vestiges of the nascent Viceregal era correspond to reused materials from the Old Houses of Axayácatl. These premises, like so many other structures of the Sacred Precinct of Tenochtitlan, were destroyed by the Spanish and their indigenous allies, almost to their foundations.</p>

<p>
	As an example of this, embedded in the façade of the southeast interior corner of the colonial room, two pre-Hispanic dressed stones carved with sculptures in high relief were found. They depicted a feathered serpent (Quetzalcóatl) and a headdress of feathers, and must have belonged to a panel of the Palace of Axayácatl. Also, another Mexica sculpture with the glyph that symbolizes the <em>tianquiztli</em> or market was recovered, in its place as part of a shaft.</p>

<p>
	Some of the diagnostic materials, which allow the preliminary dating of these findings, are the remains of pre-Hispanic and colonial pottery, whose types (styles) belong to the aforementioned historical periods: Aztec III: Orange Monochrome, Black-on-Orange and Texcoco Burnished Earthenware; as well as glazed earthenware and Spanish and New Spain majolica.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Old Houses of Axayácatl</strong></p>

<p>
	Raúl Barrera, also a researcher at the INAH Directorate of Salvage Archaeology, reflects on the fact that some material evidence speaks volumes, by its very paucity. Such is the case for the recent discoveries in the National Monte de Piedad, which “speak” of the destruction that the main buildings of Tenochtitlan were subjected to, both for symbolic and practical purposes.</p>

<p>
	Despite the modest nature of the remains, those pre-Hispanic floors were the same ones that the Spanish invaders and their allies tread upon during their arrival to Tenochtitlan, on November 8, 1519. Moctezuma II allowed them to stay in the old houses that had belonged to his father, and soon after they turned them into their barracks.</p>

<p>
	While in that palace, numerous events took place. For example, they remodeled a room to celebrate mass, and right there, they also held various rulers captive, starting with their distinguished host: Moctezuma Xocoyotzin; as well as Cuitláhuac, lord of Iztapalapa; Cacamatzin,<em> tlatoani</em> of Texcoco; and Itzcuauhtzin, lord of Tlatelolco, among others.</p>

<p>
	Following on the massacre during the festival of Tóxcatl that took place at the Templo Mayor (“Great Temple”) on May 22 of 1520, by the order of Pedro de Alvarado, the Spanish withdrew and returned to the Palace of Axayácatl. That incident unleashed the anger of the Mexica and, at the end of June of that year, they besieged the invaders in that building. Hernán Cortés wanted to contain their fury through Moctezuma, who tried to placate them from the roof of the palace. But the efforts were in vain, as his brother Cuitláhuac had already been ordained the new ruler.</p>

<p>
	On the night of June 30, 1520, the Spanish fled to Tlaxcala by the great causeway of Tlacopan (today Tacuba), leaving behind the Old Houses of Axayácatl.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Cortés’ houses</strong></p>

<p>
	After the fall of Tenochtitlan, the surviving Mexicas were forced to destroy, with their own hands, their temples and palaces and build the new city using the same materials. The Old Houses of Axayácatl would gave way to the Houses of Hernán de Cortés, which were also the temporary headquarters of the first Cabildo of New Spain, around 1525, and of the Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca, a noble title carrying the responsibility for creating a government, granted in 1529 for his services to the Spanish Crown.</p>

<p>
	Upon the conqueror's death in 1547, his descendants retained ownership. His son Martín Cortés Zúñiga inherited the marquessate, but in 1566 he was involved in a conspiracy that sought to seize the government of New Spain, so he was expelled from the Viceroyalty. The houses and the extensive land remained in the hands of a legal representative and, already in poor condition, were sold to the Sacro Monte de Piedad in 1836.</p>

July 24, 2020 | https://gopiandcode.uk/logs/log-bloomfilters-debunked.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://gopiandcode.uk/logs/log-bloomfilters-debunked.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-org5efdc67">
<p>
There's this rather nifty feature of modern web browsers (such as
<b>Firefox</b> or <b>Chrome</b>) where the browser will automatically warn the
user if they happen to navigate to a "<i>malicious</i>" URL:
</p>

<p><img src="https://gopiandcode.uk/images/malicious-site.png" alt="malicious-site.png">
</p> 


<p>
While <i>conceptually</i> simple, this feature actually requires more
engineering effort than one would expect - in particular, tracking the
set of known malicious URLs in a practical manner turns out to be
somewhat difficult.
</p>

<p>
This is because, on one hand, trying to store the database of <i>all</i>
known malicious URLs, which, bear in mind, may contain <i>millions and
millions</i> of entries, is something that is just practically
infeasible for most users. </p><p><img src="https://gopiandcode.uk/images/database_local.png" alt="database_local.png"> </p>


<p>
Conversely, sending <i>every</i> URL that a user visits to some external
service, where it could be <i>logged</i> and <i>data-mined</i> by nefarious
third parties, is something that most users should
probably not be comfortable with.
</p>

<p>
As it turns out, browsers actually implement this functionality by
means of a rather interesting <i>compromise</i><sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Using a probabilistic data structure known as a <b>Bloom filter</b>,
Browsers maintain a approximate representation of the set of known
malicious URLs locally.  By querying this <i>space-efficient</i> local set,
browsers will only send up a <i>small proportion</i> of the honest URLs.
</p>

<p><b><i>Use a Bloom filter to act as a local proxy for queries to an external database</i>.</b>
</p>


<p>
This proxy technique, which safe-guards the privacy of millions of
users ever day, depends on <b>two key properties</b> of Bloom filters:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>No false negatives</dt><dd>This states that if a query for an URL in the
Bloom filter returns negative, then the queried item can be
guaranteed to not be present in the set of malicious URLs - i.e
<i>the Bloom filter is guaranteed to return a positive result for
all known malicious URLs</i>.</dd>

<dt>Low false positive rate</dt><dd>This property states that for any URL
that is <i>not in the set of malicious</i> URLs, the likelihood of a
Bloom filter query returning a positive result should be <i>fairly
low</i> - thus minimising the number of <i>unnecessary</i> infractions on
user privacy.</dd>
</dl>


<p>
This mechanism works <i>quite</i> well, and the guarantees of a Bloom filter
seem to be perfectly suited for this particular task, however it has
one small problem, and that is:
</p>

<p><b><i>The</i> widely cited expression <i>for the</i> false positive rate <i>of a bloom filter is</i> wrong!</b>
</p>


<p>
In fact, as it turns out, the behaviours of a Bloom filter have
actually been the subject of 30 years of mathematical contention,
requiring <i>multiple</i> corrections and even <i>corrections of these
corrections</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Given this history of errors, can we really have any certainty in our
understanding of a Bloom filter at all?</b>
</p>

<p>
Well, <i>never fear</i>, I am writing this post to inform you that we have
just recently used <code>Coq</code> to produce the <i>very first</i> <b>certified</b> proof
of the false positive rate of a Bloom filter, finally putting an end to
this saga of errors and returning certainty (pardon the pun<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>) to a
mechanism that countless people rely on <i>every single</i> day.
</p>

<p>
In the rest of this post, we'll explore the main highlights of this
research, answering the following questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a Bloom filter?</li>
<li>Why did these errors initially arise?</li>
<li>What is the true behaviour of a Bloom filter? and how can we be certain?</li>
</ul>


<p>
This research was just recently presented at CAV2020 under the title

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody" id="content"><p>If your an engineer you probably spend a lot of time using a terminal.
Some of your best productivity gains will come from understanding it better and making small improvements to repetitive tasks.</p><p>Many people know the basics for default shell shortcuts like Ctrl+a and Ctrl+e to go to the begining and end of a line.
There are also a few keyboard shortcuts you’ve probably found by accident like Ctrl+s, Ctrl+z, or Ctrl+c.</p><p>Here are some keyboard shortcuts I use regularly that you might find helpful too.
I’m focusing on zsh because that’s my preferred interactive shell but many of these shortcuts will work in bash or other shells too.</p><p>If you want more shell tips, check out my mastering zsh workshop <a href="https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh">https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh</a>.</p><p>We’ll start with some basic keyboard shortcuts and get progressivly more advanced.
Many of these shortcuts are default behavior but some will need code added to your configuration to enable them.</p><h3 id="basics">Basics</h3><p>I’m amazed how long it took me to learn these keybord shortcuts and see that people still don’t know them.</p><p><code>Ctrl+r</code>: Reverse search through your command history.
Kinda like pushing the up arrow with search.</p><p><code>Ctrl+c</code>: kill/interupt the current running process.
If you don’t want it to print <code>^C</code> every time you press it you can add <code>set echo-control-characters Off</code> to your <code>~/.inputrc</code> file.</p><p><code>Ctrl+d</code>: Close your current terminal.
Same as typing <code>exit</code> but way shorter.</p><p><code>Ctrl+l</code>: clear the screen.
Similar, but slightly different, to typing <code>clear</code>.</p><p><code>Ctrl+z</code>: Suspend process.
This is really helpful if you’re in your editor and you need to run a command real quick.
Instead of opening a new terminal press <code>ctrl+z</code>, run your command, and then type <code>fg</code> to bring the command back to the foreground.</p><h3 id="delete-word-behind-your-cursor">Delete word behind your cursor</h3><p>If you have a command typed out or selected from your history with Ctrl+r you probably want to change one or two words from it.</p><p>First you can move your cursor back a word with <code>Alt+b</code>.
Press it multiple times to keep moving back.</p><p>Once your cursor is at the end of the word you need to change/delete press <code>Ctrl+w</code> to delete it.
If it doesn’t delete up to the characters you expect try setting your <code>$WORDCHARS</code> variable to characters that should be considered part of the word.</p><h3 id="don-t-repeat-your-whole-arguments">Don’t repeat your whole arguments</h3><p>If you need to move a file to something like a $FILE.bak you can do that easily with <code>{,}</code>.</p><p>Don’t do this</p><pre><code>cp ~/this-is/my-long-file/name.txt ~/this-is/my-long-file/name.txt.bak
</code></pre><p>Do this</p><pre><code>cp ~/this-is/my-long-file/name.txt{,.bak}
</code></pre><p>It works anywhere in the command too!
This will copy name.txt into new-folder (assuming it exists).</p><pre><code>cp ~/this-is/{my-long-file,new-folder}/name.txt
</code></pre><h3 id="enter-last-argument-from-previous-command-s">Enter last argument from previous command(s)</h3><p>There is a default shell variable <code>$?</code> which represents the last argument from the preceeding command (e.g. <code>echo $?</code>)
<code>Ctrl+.</code> is the keyboard shortcut to do the same thing.
Not only is it easier to type but you can push it multiple times to cycle through the last argument from previous commands.</p><h3 id="prepend-sudo">Prepend sudo</h3><p>I need this a lot.
You type out a command or find it from your history and need to run it with sudo but forgot it at the begining of the line.
Normally you would <code>Ctrl+a</code> type <code>sudo</code> then <code>Ctrl+e</code>.
This shortcuts does all that with a single shortcut.</p><p>Add this code snippet to your .zshrc
I prefer <code>esc, s</code> for the keyboard shortcut because it works well in vim mode and doesn’t clobber the default <code>Ctrl+s</code> shortcut.</p><pre><code># add sudo before command with esc, s
function prepend-sudo() {
  [[ -z $BUFFER ]] &amp;&amp; zle up-history
  if [[ $BUFFER == sudo\ * ]]; then
    LBUFFER="${LBUFFER#sudo }"
  else
    LBUFFER="sudo $LBUFFER"
  fi
}
zle -N prepend-sudo
# shortcut keys: [Esc] [s]
bindkey "\es" prepend-sudo
</code></pre><p><img src="https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh/raw/master/img/prepend-sudo.gif" alt=""></p><p>If you’re using oh-my-zsh you can add the <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/plugins/sudo/sudo.plugin.zsh#L32">sudo plugin</a> and the default key binding is <code>esc, esc</code>.</p><h3 id="open-command-in-editor">Open command in $EDITOR</h3><p>There is a really handy command <code>fc</code> which will open your last command in your $EDITOR.
It’s great for long or multi-line command edits.</p><p>There are lots of other ways to accomplish editing the last command you can check out <a href="https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh/blob/master/docs/config/history.md#modifying-the-last-command">here</a>.</p><p>To edit your current command in your editor add this snippet to your .zshrc</p><pre><code>autoload -U edit-command-line
zle -N edit-command-line
# shortcut key: [Esc] [v]
bindkey "\ev" edit-command-line
</code></pre><p><img src="https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh/raw/master/img/fc-example.gif" alt=""></p><p>Now next time you copy/paste a multi-line command from somewhere it’ll be easy to edit.</p><h3 id="cut-current-line-and-then-paste-it-on-your-next-prompt">Cut current line and then paste it on your next prompt</h3><p>If you need to run a command before the command you currently have typed you can cut/yank it and then paste/pop it at your next prompt with yank-pop.
This gif explains it better.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh/raw/master/img/push-input.gif" alt=""></p><p>In zsh this is called <code>push-line-or-edit</code> and it’s a default widget you can enable with.</p><pre><code>bindkey '^q' push-line-or-edit
</code></pre><p>A bonus feature is your cursor line will be in the same place after the command is pasted to the new prompt.</p></article></div>]]>

<p>Historically, US Presidents have entered the White House at a <a href="https://t.co/v8DD3uCI85?amp=1">median age of 55</a>. </p>



<p>Trump was the oldest ever to become president. If he is re-elected and serves a full second term, he would become the oldest sitting president of all-time (surpassing Reagan in his second term). If Biden is elected, he would become the oldest sitting president of all-time too, on his first day. </p>



<p>We are going the wrong way.</p>



<p>Bernie and Bloomberg were even older than Biden. Warren would have been older than Trump upon election. Of the 7 candidates who won at least 1 delegate in the Democratic Primary, 4 were in their 70s, 1 was in her 60s, and 2 were in their 30s. Isn’t it odd that none of them were in their 40s or 50s? It seems that the ages of our presidential candidate’s are becoming as polarized as their politics. There is no one in the middle! I want a middle candidate for president in terms of both age and politics.</p>



<p>In terms of approximating an appropriate age, 40s and 50s seem like a reasonable range. Cognitive function is certainly not all that makes a good president but it would seem to be a significant factor. According to a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614567339?casa_token=L29u1CmuY6gAAAAA%3AHwbJVxHMdjeQxoe1A1UcjnE-sTEy1YhbSyhlQic62On1RpUMpAd0JKWh7H2IvB3tj5dmN8nw2g4x&amp;journalCode=pssa">study </a>in Psychological Science, it does not look like anything good happens after 55. Of course, there is something to be said for growing wiser with age and other good arguments of that nature which are totally valid. I should clarify that when I say that nothing good happens after 55, I am stricly speaking in scientific terms of cognitive function for the average person. No offense to my elders (and sorry for calling you elders).</p>

<p>There are other studies that suggest the best age for decision-making and leadership tends to be during a person’s 50s. Of course, there are many exceptions. This is not an exact science applicable to every person by any means. Still, it seems like reasonable enough support to justify a solid range in which being too young or too old should almost never be an issue.</p>



<p>Politics completely aside, the age range of recent candidates like Yang (45), O’Rourke (47), Cruz (49), Rubio (49), Booker (51), and Harris (55) seems to be an appropriate one. They are all between 45 and 55 which presents an even narrower ranger than what I previously defined as 40s and 50s. Again, I am not saying that this is a range that our president needs to be within by any means, but it seem like a good age range to be within nonetheless. I may have issues with any or all of these candidates listed above but in no case are any of my top concerns in any way related to their ages. Same goes for Kanye (43).</p>



<p>It is helpful also to think about the best leaders our world has to offer outside of politics. I think it is safe to assume that the most successful companies tend to have some of the most successful CEOs.</p>



<p>Here are the ages of the CEOs of the 7 largest companies in the world:</p>



<ul><li>Microsoft’s Satya Nadella (52) </li><li>Apple’s Tim Cook (59) </li><li>Amazon’s Jeff Bezos (56) </li><li>Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai (47) </li><li>Alibaba’s Daniel Zhang  (48) </li><li>Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg (36) </li><li>Tencent’s Ma Huateng (48) </li></ul>



<p>The median age of those world-leading CEOs is 48 and the average is 50. Let us add Elon Musk into the mix for good measure. The man who is revolutionizing the auto industry and sending Americans to space is 48. Coincidentally, I would argue the president should be leading bothing of those efforts.</p>



<p>The point I am making is that we should not be debating the mental fitness of our candidates based on age. That does not mean that I would never vote for someone in their 70s. I just wish I had an electable option not to. Candidates in their early 30s and late 60s generally seem a bit young and old to me for the role of president, respectively, but I would certainly vote for the right candidate at 35 or 65, and even someone in their 80s if that individual candidate seemed great to me. I do not want to be written off as an ageist for having written this and if that is not a term yet I am sure that it will be soon. Just because I would generally want my football team’s quarterback to be in his 20s or early 30s doesn’t mean I would not prefer Tom Brady in his 40’s to most of the other quarterbacks in the league. It seems to me that 40s and 50s are good years of age to be had by the person in the most powerful position in the world, The President of the United States of America. </p>

<p>At the current moment, neural nets are trained once, in the “training phase” and then inputs are sent to them to test their intelligence. But as I sit here somewhat affected by cannabis, I realize that any sufficiently strong artificial general intelligence will have to have some type of analog of drugs just like we do.</p>



<p>Everyone likes to say that an AGI would be so much more powerful than ourselves. Now would you consider an AGI that was unable to take drugs superior to a human? The thing is that if we want AGIs to have parity with ourselves then any training that they undergo should be equivalent to any kind of questions that we ask them. Currently NN are the way they are because we’re exploiting AI for cheap computations. </p>



<p>Lets let’s rewind for a sec and ask a hypothetical question. What would happen if I took a human brain outside the body and asked it a question and then tried to extract the answer. Aside from all the complexities of encoding and decoding, we don’t know if the writes to the brain can be disentangled from the reads to the brain. It doesn’t seem like anyone has even asked the question: Does an AGI need to have both reads and writes intertwined in such a complex way to produce intelligence? Perhaps, this is the easiest way to produce AGI.</p>



<p>I believe self-modifying neural nets are the solution to AGI. Our current neural nets are designed as commodity tools for calculations – literally designed to eventually, after training, become a frozen set of, in GPT-3’s case, 175 billion parameters. I do believe if we want to have a chance with GPT-3 becoming AI, we will need to somehow pipe the results of its conversations back into itself..online training. Is this being considered at all?</p>



<p>Let’s put self modification back and allow our neural nets to take drugs. As silly as that sounds it really is the path forward. For neural nets that need to execute quickly, we can figure out ways to ignore the writes and only do the reads for performance reasons. We should start designing architectures based on self-modifying principles. Paradigms in AI need to change. ML can stay where it is if all it wants to do is model pure functions with non-linear pipelines of matrix operations.</p>

		<p>Ever since I can remember, I've been fascinated by understanding the universe. I began as a game hacker, tearing things down, taking them apart (figuratively, using Softice and Ollydbg.) I made mods for HL using Small C. And websites in PHP. I went to university for Biomedical Sciences but did not pursue an MD. I kept doing software development. I worked for many startups and then big name companies, like Amazon.</p>
<p>The corporate culture was not for me. Startup culture was not to my liking either, however better than the toxic culture at Amazon. I prefer to remain independent, although I would love to get a PHD in Pure Mathematics. It's tough to go back to school though I would love to.</p>
<p>In the last 5 years, I've switched gears to Mathematics and Physics. I bought many used textbooks and am in the middle of studying real/complex analysis. It is a steep hill to climb, but having learned computer science / algorithms, and read lots of Claude Shannon, Gregory Chaitin, Von Neumann, and other logician/computer scientist's work, has given me a unique perspective on the relationship between information, computation, physics, and life/consciousness. Many mathematicians can not even program. I feel it is a huge mistake when the subjects are so interconnected.</p>
<p>I have many ideas but the one I am seeking to fund is called Life. Most ambitious projects that aim to simulate OUR universe, fail for lack of computing power, and lack of a Grand Unified Theory - it's a fruitless and frail endeavor.</p>
<p>INSTEAD, I aim to reduce the necessary universal principles to ones that are necessary just for life to exist and sprout. This is not an easy task, and one can never be sure if one can create life. Perhaps our universe is very special and uniquely able to produce life whereas other configurations will fail. There is no way to know except to try. Even if we fail to produce life, there will be interesting behavior discovered.</p>

					<p><em>Google Play&nbsp;removes Boomerang Parental Control – I share our recent experience dealing with Google’s Appeals team.</em></p>
<h3>About us</h3>
<p>We are a team of three Dads with the combined goal of helping families start conversations with their kids about technology use. Over 5 years ago, the core features were built by our CTO based on his own family’s needs to limit his son’s time spent on his tablet. We innovated way before the big companies and continue to innovate having features that the big companies do not have. Now that everyone is aware of the essential need to ensure that our kids grow up with a balanced approach to technology usage, the big companies built their own tools with a massive competitive advantage: they own the operating system they want to control. In 2018, Apple made changes that saw&nbsp;us have <a href="http://useboomerang.com/2020/01/31/letter-users-apple-parental-controls/">difficulties supporting iOS devices</a>&nbsp;after announcing screen time features in iOS12.&nbsp;In early 2019,&nbsp;<a href="http://useboomerang.com/2019/03/13/boomerang-vs-google-re-call-sms-permissions/">Google also changed their permission requirements</a> for apps declaring Calls and SMS permissions which&nbsp;was used with parents’ consent for our calls and text message safety features (this guideline change resulted in us offering&nbsp;a <a href="http://useboomerang.com/download/">sideload download option</a>&nbsp;that continues to offer&nbsp;these safety features). Now in 2020, it seems Google is taking similar measures on Android with their Family Link app which is tied into your Google account. Below is a timeline of our recent experience with the Google Play Appeals Team who have shown a very inconsistent relationship with their developers and how they review apps. There were some very frustrated messages back to Google’s Appeals Team below as we strongly believe Google’s completely in the wrong with their assessment of our apps and leveraging their size and strength to force us into changing (which we have yet are still stuck in a Rejected state at the time of this post).</p>
<h3>Experience with Google’s App Review</h3>
<p>Compared to Apple’s App Store app reviews, Google Play app reviews are way more automated. In the past year we received a few false positives where we were rejected for Deceptive Behavior in <a href="https://useboomerang.com/">Boomerang Parental Control</a> and our other app, <a href="https://filterchrome.com/">Filter Chrome</a> because our app didn’t allow the user to uninstall our app “easily”. Please note our apps are designed to be installed on kid devices owned by parents and self-identifying pornography addicts with our Filter Chrome app. A prevent removal feature is key to keep these users safe and is employed by all competitors, including Google’s own Family Link. I call these false positives as when we would upload a new version, without any changes except for a higher version number, our update would pass and we would be fine for months after. I can confirm this is a fairly common practice by Google Play developers, including apps in our parental control category.</p>
<p>This May, we had a similar violation but our apps were completely removed from Google Play within a few days of our updates (these updates were bug fixes). We thought similar to our previous experience so we proceeded to upload another update in the same fashion… This time was different. As an Android developer, when we update our app, we will upload it to what is called the “Alpha Track” on our Google Play Console. This where our update will be published and only available as an “internal” version for us to test before releasing to the public (what is called the Production track). We had never had our Production version completely removed from Google Play before for an update we published in the Alpha track. We received the same robotic template reply with the same Deceptive Behavior violation but this time, Google’s App Review completely removed our Production app from the Play Store. No warning and an ambiguous message that they couldn’t uninstall our app. We tried the same previous method of doing a version update but this time we were completely stuck. Below is the full documented timeline of events in our experience – we feel we have been wrongly targeted here and need to bring visibility into this poor handling by Google which has also cost a month’s revenue so far.</p>
<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>
<p><strong>May 8th 2020:</strong> Our latest update (version 1257) gets flagged for <strong>“CAN’T UNINSTALL APP – Your app violates the Deceptive Behavior policy.”</strong> (screenshot below) The link to their policy does not state anything related to uninstall actions but mentions “<strong>Apps that modify device settings or features with the user’s consent but do so in a way that is not easily reversible.”</strong> There are no examples of what easily reversible looks like. Boomerang Parental Control, just like many other apps like us <span><strong>including Google’s own Family Link</strong></span>, have an easily reversible approach to turning off protection and uninstalling. The reality of parental control apps is, Parents do not want an easily removable app on their child’s Android device – this is a fact and product management 101. Plus, it’s with our user feedback that we added this feature several years ago so our app cannot be removed easily by a child – this is also a key component to any parental controls parent pay for. On some devices, it is not possible to fully lock in our app so we still offer a notification to parents when their child tampers with our app by either turning off specific permissions like the Device Administrator.</p>

<p><strong>May 11th, 2020:</strong> I filed an Appeal [3-0733000030602] with the Google Play Appeals Team. Based on previous experience, I also resubmitted an update to our app as a way to see if this was just an error by Google’s app review robots.</p>
<p><strong>May 13th, 2020:</strong> Our update gets approved (screenshot below).</p>
<p><img src="https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24101844/Email-050820201-1024x574.png" alt="Our update gets approved" width="960" height="538" srcset="https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24101844/Email-050820201-1024x574.png 1024w, https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24101844/Email-050820201-300x168.png 300w, https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24101844/Email-050820201-768x430.png 768w, https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24101844/Email-050820201-600x336.png 600w, https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24101844/Email-050820201-875x490.png 875w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></p>
<p><strong>May 14th, 2020:</strong> Reply from the Appeals Team with the following message, <span>no actual feedback on my message to the Appeals Team on the removal that occurred on May 8th 2020</span>. <em>Tip for developers: You also do not receive a copy of your original message to them so make sure to make a copy.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24102356/Email-05142020-1024x345.png" alt="Email - 05142020" width="960" height="323" srcset="https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24102356/Email-05142020-1024x345.png 1024w, https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24102356/Email-05142020-300x101.png 300w, https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24102356/Email-05142020-768x259.png 768w, https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24102356/Email-05142020-600x202.png 600w, https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24102356/Email-05142020-875x295.png 875w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></p>
<p>At this point, we thought all would be fine just like previous experiences where we get flagged, republish an update, receive approval and stay live on Google Play. In this case, only until June 26th. This is when things started to really feel like targeting by Google’s review team.</p>
<p><strong>June 26th, 2020:</strong> I received the following message which flagged multiple versions of our&nbsp;Filter Chrome&nbsp;versions, many were archived and never released to the public.</p>
<p><img src="https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24102905/06262020-FIlter-Chrome-versions-removal-1024x730.png" alt="06262020 - FIlter Chrome versions removal" width="960" height="684" srcset="https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24102905/06262020-FIlter-Chrome-versions-removal-1024x730.png 1024w, https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24102905/06262020-FIlter-Chrome-versions-removal-300x214.png 300w, https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24102905/06262020-FIlter-Chrome-versions-removal-768x548.png 768w, https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24102905/06262020-FIlter-Chrome-versions-removal-600x428.png 600w, https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24102905/06262020-FIlter-Chrome-versions-removal-875x624.png 875w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></p>
<p><strong>June 30th 2020:</strong> After 45 days of smooth operation (since our May 14th update), Boomerang Parental Control gets flagged again for the same ambiguous CAN’T UNINSTALL APP reason – 4 days after our&nbsp;Filter Chrome app gets flagged too for the same reason. I’m saying ambiguous as what is mentioned in the email (see below) does not share the language of the policy I’m supposed to use to make corrections to the violation. Furthermore, I know our competitors and <strong>Google’s own Family Link use the same approach</strong> that Google’s App Review says we are in violation of. This is absolute hypocrisy.</p>

<p><strong>July 2nd, 2020:</strong>&nbsp;I filed another appeal with the following message. For clarity, our prevent removal feature is not enabled by default without the user’s consent. The parent/guardian or self managing person using our apps must manually turn on our app protection.&nbsp;You&nbsp;cannot get a copy of your appeal message so I copied it this time.</p>
<p><em><span>Message sent in the Appeals form</span>: </em></p>
<p><em>We do not have anything in our Parental Control app Boomerang that has a prevent removal feature. Why the removal? Your guidelines are not being followed by your robots and I’m repeating myself again that your guidelines does not explicitly mention anything related to “CAN’T UNINSTALL APP”. I WANT TO TALK TO SOMEONE – NO MORE CANNED TEMPLATE REPLIES, PLEASE.</em></p>
<p><em>What are your robots looking for? Keywords in the metadata? User review keywords (which in our case come mostly negatively from kids who have their parents install our app on the kids phones that parents own!).</em></p>
<p><strong>July 3rd, 2020:</strong> I reactivated my Premium account on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jpayeur/" target="_blank">LinkedIN</a> and researched key contacts in Google Play’s Policy Team such as “Policy Leader” and “Policy Specialist”. I found about 20 whom I sent them a similar InMail message to the following screenshot below. Update July 22nd, 2020: I have yet to receive any feedback/reply from the people who create and manage Google Play’s Policies.</p>

<p><strong>July 6th, 2020: </strong>We had to inform our users about our difficulties with Google as inquiries were pilling in from them sharing that they were no longer able to find our app on Google Play. Our email was&nbsp;titled “<a href="https://us9.campaign-archive.com/?u=def604cc98ecfc90acf27aec4&amp;id=a786c3e4c0" target="_blank">Google has become Evil</a>”. We received several replies, including a few like the following:</p>
<p><em>Does this mean that my son will be able to uninstall boomerang from his device? If so, the program will be absolutely worthless to me!</em></p>
<p><em>Are you saying that there will no longer be any protection on uninstallation of the app? If so, what is even the point of the app? Is this going to be completely discontinued or just the Play Store version?</em></p>
<p><em>Removing the prevent uninstall option doesn’t make it worth paying for, obviously. Is this going to be fixed, or do I end my subscription and get the balance refunded to me?</em></p>
<p><strong>July 7th, 2020:</strong> I received the following message from the Google Play Team. My gut is now not feeling right (deja vu of <a href="http://useboomerang.com/2020/01/31/letter-users-apple-parental-controls/">our experience with Apple in 2018/2019</a>). My reply is included here too – <em>as of July 22nd, 2020, I have yet to receive any answers to my previous questions.</em></p>

<p><strong>July 8th, 2020:</strong> The following reply is received from Google. Google is now quoting various policies to build a case against our approach in protecting our app which is still allowed in many other apps recently updated on Google Play, <strong>including their own Family Link</strong>, a direct competitor to Boomerang Parental Control. Upon reviewing our app protection, we did find we could improve how the protection works to make it clearer to the user (typically a child, not an adult) on why the Device Administrator permission is protected. This mimicked many other apps I reviewed on Google Play so we made the change and pushed this update with the …</p></div></div>

<p>Iâ€™ve just been readÂ­ing <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/user/lukeprog/">Lukeâ€™s</a> <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/hN2aRnu798yas5b2k/a-crash-course-in-the-neuroscience-of-human-motivation">â€œCrash Course in the NeuÂ­roÂ­science of HuÂ­man MoÂ­tiÂ­vaÂ­tion.â€�</a> It is a useÂ­ful text, alÂ­though there are a few techÂ­niÂ­cal erÂ­rors and a few bits of outÂ­dated inÂ­forÂ­maÂ­tion (see [1], upÂ­dated inÂ­forÂ­maÂ­tion about one parÂ­ticÂ­uÂ­lar quibÂ­ble in [2] and [3]).</p>
<p>There is one sigÂ­nifiÂ­cant missÂ­ing piece, howÂ­ever, which is of critÂ­iÂ­cal imÂ­porÂ­tance for our subÂ­ject matÂ­ter here on LW: the effect of atÂ­tenÂ­tion on plasÂ­ticÂ­ity, inÂ­cludÂ­ing the plasÂ­ticÂ­ity of moÂ­tiÂ­vaÂ­tion. Since I donâ€™t see any other texts adÂ­dressÂ­ing it diÂ­rectly (cerÂ­tainly not from a neuÂ­roÂ­scienÂ­tific perÂ­specÂ­tive), letâ€™s cover the main idea here.</p>
<p>SumÂ­mary for imÂ­paÂ­tient readÂ­ers: foÂ­cus of atÂ­tenÂ­tion physÂ­iÂ­cally deÂ­terÂ­mines which synapses in your brain get stronger, and which arÂ­eas of your corÂ­tex physÂ­iÂ­cally grow in size. The imÂ­pliÂ­caÂ­tions of this provide diÂ­rect guidance for alÂ­terÂ­aÂ­tion of beÂ­havÂ­iors and moÂ­tiÂ­vaÂ­tional patÂ­terns. This <em>is</em> used for this purÂ­pose exÂ­tenÂ­sively: for inÂ­stance, many benefits of the CogÂ­niÂ­tive-BeÂ­havÂ­ioral TherÂ­apy apÂ­proach rely on this mechanism.<a id="more"></a></p>

<p><strong>I â€“ AtÂ­tenÂ­tion and plasticity</strong></p>
<p>To illusÂ­trate this propÂ­erly, we need to define two terms. Iâ€™m guessÂ­ing these are very faÂ­milÂ­iar to most readÂ­ers here, but letâ€™s cover them briefly just in case.</p>
<p>First thing to keep in mind is <em>the</em> <em>plasÂ­ticÂ­ity of corÂ­tiÂ­cal maps.</em> In essence, parÂ­ticÂ­uÂ­lar funcÂ­tional arÂ­eas of our brain can exÂ­pand or shrink based on how ofÂ­ten (and how inÂ­tensely) they are used. A small amount of this growth is physÂ­iÂ­cal, as new axÂ­ons grow, exÂ­pandÂ­ing the white matÂ­ter; most of it hapÂ­pens by reÂ­purÂ­posÂ­ing any less-used cirÂ­cuitry in the vicinity of the acÂ­tive area. For exÂ­amÂ­ple, our sense of sight is proÂ­cessed by our viÂ­sual corÂ­tex, which turns sigÂ­nals from our eyes into lines, shapes, colÂ­ors and moveÂ­ment. In blind peoÂ­ple, howÂ­ever, this part of the brain beÂ­comes inÂ­vaded by other senses, and beÂ­gins to proÂ­cess senÂ­saÂ­tions like touch and hearÂ­ing, such that they beÂ­come sigÂ­nifiÂ­cantly more senÂ­siÂ­tive than in sighted peoÂ­ple. Similarly, in deaf peoÂ­ple, auÂ­diÂ­tory corÂ­tex (part of the brain that proÂ­cesses sounds) beÂ­comes adapted to proÂ­cess viÂ­sual inÂ­forÂ­maÂ­tion and gather lanÂ­guage clues by sight.</p>
<p>SeÂ­cond conÂ­cept weâ€™ll need is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_somatosensory_cortex"><em>soÂ­matosenÂ­sory corÂ­tex</em></a> (SSC for short). This is an area of the (verÂ­teÂ­brate) brain where most of the inÂ­comÂ­ing touch and poÂ­siÂ­tional (proÂ­priÂ­oÂ­cepÂ­tive) senÂ­saÂ­tions from the body conÂ­verge. There is a map-like qualÂ­ity to this part of our brain, as evÂ­ery body part links to a parÂ­ticÂ­uÂ­lar bit of the SSC surÂ­face (which can be illusÂ­trated with silly-lookÂ­ing things, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sensory_Homunculus.png">senÂ­sory hoÂ­muncuÂ­lus</a>). More touch-senÂ­siÂ­tive arÂ­eas of the body have larger corÂ­reÂ­spondÂ­ing arÂ­eas within the SSC.</p>
<p>With these two in mind, letâ€™s conÂ­sider one acÂ­tual exÂ­perÂ­iÂ­ment [4]. ScienÂ­tists meaÂ­sured and mapped the area of an owl monÂ­keyâ€™s SSC which beÂ­came acÂ­tiÂ­vated when one of his fingerÂ­tips was touched. The monÂ­key was then trained to hold that finger on a tacÂ­tile stimÂ­uÂ­laÂ­tor â€“ a movÂ­ing wheel that stimÂ­uÂ­lates touch reÂ­cepÂ­tors. The monÂ­key had to pay atÂ­tenÂ­tion to the stimÂ­uÂ­lus, and was reÂ­warded for letÂ­ting go upon deÂ­tectÂ­ing cerÂ­tain changes in spinÂ­ning freÂ­quency. After a few weeks of trainÂ­ing, the area was meaÂ­sured again.</p>
<p>As you probÂ­aÂ­bly exÂ­pected, the area had grown larger. The touch-proÂ­cessÂ­ing neuÂ­rons grew out, co-optÂ­ing surÂ­roundÂ­ing cirÂ­cuitry in orÂ­der to achieve betÂ­ter and faster proÂ­cessÂ­ing of the stimÂ­uÂ­lus that proÂ­duced the reÂ­ward. Which is, so far, just anÂ­other way of showÂ­ing plasÂ­ticÂ­ity of corÂ­tiÂ­cal maps.</p>
<p>But then, there is someÂ­thing else. The SSC area exÂ­panded only when the monÂ­key had to <em>pay atÂ­tenÂ­tion</em> to the senÂ­saÂ­tion of touch in orÂ­der to reÂ­ceive the reÂ­ward. If a monÂ­key was trained to keep a hand on the wheel that moved just the same, but he did not have to pay atÂ­tenÂ­tion to itâ€¦ the corÂ­tiÂ­cal map reÂ­mained the same size. This findÂ­ing has since been repliÂ­cated in huÂ­mans, many times (for inÂ­stance [5, 6]).</p>
<p>Take a moÂ­ment to conÂ­sider what this means.</p>
<p>A man is sitÂ­ting in his livÂ­ing room, in front of a chessÂ­board. ClasÂ­siÂ­cal muÂ­sic plays in the backÂ­ground. The man is foÂ­cused, thinkÂ­ing about the next move, about his chess stratÂ­egy, and about the fuÂ­ture posÂ­siÂ­bilÂ­ities of the game. His neuÂ­ral netÂ­works are opÂ­tiÂ­mizÂ­ing, makÂ­ing him a betÂ­ter chess player.</p>

His neuÂ­ral netÂ­works are opÂ­tiÂ­mizÂ­ing, makÂ­ing the pain more inÂ­tense, easÂ­ier to feel, harder to igÂ­nore.</p>

<p><strong>II â€“ PracÂ­tiÂ­cal imÂ­pliÂ­caÂ­tions: makÂ­ing and breakÂ­ing habits, effiÂ­cacy of CBT </strong></p>
<p>HaÂ­bitÂ­ual learned beÂ­havÂ­iors are ofÂ­ten illusÂ­trated with the exÂ­amÂ­ple of drivÂ­ing. When we are learnÂ­ing to drive, we have to pay atÂ­tenÂ­tion to evÂ­eryÂ­thing: when to push the pedÂ­als, when to sigÂ­nal, where to hold our handsâ€¦ A few years later, these beÂ­havÂ­iors beÂ­come so auÂ­toÂ­matic, we hardly pay atÂ­tenÂ­tion at all. InÂ­deed, most of us can drive for hours while carÂ­ryÂ­ing on conÂ­verÂ­saÂ­tions or listenÂ­ing to auÂ­dioÂ­books. We are comÂ­pletely unÂ­aware, as our own body keeps pushÂ­ing pedÂ­als, sigÂ­nalÂ­ing turns, and changÂ­ing gears.</p>
<p>We can thereÂ­fore say that <em>drivÂ­ing beÂ­havÂ­iors</em>, through pracÂ­tice and atÂ­tenÂ­tion, evenÂ­tuÂ­ally beÂ­come auÂ­toÂ­matic â€“ which is, most of the time, a good thing. But so do many other things, inÂ­cludÂ­ing some deÂ­strucÂ­tive ones we might want to get rid of. Letâ€™s take a simÂ­ple one: nail bitÂ­ing. You are readÂ­ing, or watchÂ­ing a movie, or thinkÂ­ing, or drivÂ­ingâ€¦ when you sudÂ­denly noÂ­tice some minor pain, and reÂ­alÂ­ize that you have chewed your nail into a ragged stump. Ouch!</p>
<p>You catch yourÂ­self bitÂ­ing, you stop. Five minÂ­utes later, you catch yourÂ­self bitÂ­ing again. You stop again. ReÂ­peat <em>ad inÂ­finiÂ­tum</em>, or <em>ad nauÂ­seam</em>, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>CogÂ­niÂ­tive-BeÂ­havÂ­ioral TherÂ­apy has a highly sucÂ­cessÂ­ful apÂ­proach for breakÂ­ing habits, which reÂ­quires only a very subÂ­tle alÂ­terÂ­aÂ­tion to this proÂ­cess. You noÂ­tice that you are bitÂ­ing your nails. You imÂ­meÂ­diÂ­ately foÂ­cus your atÂ­tenÂ­tion on what you are doÂ­ing, and you stop doÂ­ing it. No rage, no blamÂ­ing yourÂ­self, no negaÂ­tive emoÂ­tions. You just stop, and you foÂ­cus all the atÂ­tenÂ­tion you can on the act of stopÂ­ping. You move your arm down, foÂ­cusÂ­ing your atÂ­tenÂ­tion on the act of moveÂ­ment, on the feelÂ­ing of your arm goÂ­ing down, away from your mouth. Thatâ€™s it. You can go back to whatÂ­ever you were doÂ­ing.</p>
<p>Five minÂ­utes later, you noÂ­tice yourÂ­self bitÂ­ing your nails again. You calmly reÂ­peat the proÂ­ceÂ­dure again.</p>
<p>By doÂ­ing this, you are trainÂ­ing yourÂ­self to perform a new beÂ­havÂ­ior â€“ the â€œstop and put the hand downâ€� beÂ­havÂ­ior â€“ which is itÂ­self trigÂ­gered by the nail-bitÂ­ing beÂ­havÂ­ior. As you go along, you will get betÂ­ter and betÂ­ter at noticÂ­ing that you have started to bite your nails. You will also get betÂ­ter and betÂ­ter at stopÂ­ping and putting your hand down. After a while, this will beÂ­come semi-auÂ­toÂ­matic; youâ€™ll noÂ­tice that your hand went to your mouth, a nail touched your tooth, and the hand went back down beÂ­fore you could do anyÂ­thing. Donâ€™t stop trainÂ­ing: foÂ­cus your atÂ­tenÂ­tion on the â€œstop and dropâ€� part of the acÂ­tion.</p>
<p>After a while, the nail-bitÂ­ing simÂ­ply goes away. Of course, the more comÂ­plex and more inÂ­grained a habit is, the more effort and time will be needed to break it. But for most peoÂ­ple, even strong habits can be relÂ­aÂ­tively quickly weakÂ­ened, or rediÂ­rected into less deÂ­strucÂ­tive beÂ­havÂ­iors.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s probÂ­aÂ­bly obÂ­viÂ­ous that habits can be <em>creÂ­ated</em> in this way as well. We donâ€™t beÂ­come betÂ­ter at things we do â€“ we beÂ­come betÂ­ter at things we <em>pay atÂ­tenÂ­tion to while weâ€™re doÂ­ing them.</em> If you want to make exÂ­erÂ­cise a habit, your efforts will be much more effecÂ­tive if you foÂ­cus your atÂ­tenÂ­tion on your exÂ­erÂ­cise techÂ­nique, rather than reÂ­peatÂ­edly thinkÂ­ing how painful and tiring the whole proÂ­cess is.</p>
<p>There is also a diÂ­rect imÂ­pliÂ­caÂ­tion for trainÂ­ing in any comÂ­plex skill. Start with the well-known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve">learnÂ­ing curve</a> effect: we gain a lot of skill relÂ­aÂ­tively quickly, and then imÂ­proveÂ­ments slow down inÂ­creÂ­menÂ­tally as we apÂ­proach our maxÂ­iÂ­mum poÂ­tenÂ­tial skill level. It is relÂ­aÂ­tively easy to go from a poor to a mediocre tenÂ­nis player; it is much, much harder to go from mediocre to good, and even harder to go from good to exÂ­celÂ­lent.</p>
<p>ComÂ­plex skills have many differÂ­ent asÂ­pects, which we usuÂ­ally atÂ­tempt to train siÂ­mulÂ­taÂ­neously. We can beÂ­come very good at some, while stayÂ­ing poor at othÂ­ers. The opÂ­tiÂ­mal apÂ­proach would be to foÂ­cus most of our atÂ­tenÂ­tion on those asÂ­pects where our abilÂ­ities are weakÂ­est, since smaller inÂ­vestÂ­ments of time and effort will lead to larger imÂ­proveÂ­ments in skill.</p>

<p>In our society we revere scientists far more than we revere historians. Consequently, people are often more willing to listen to what scientists say about history than what historians say about history. Unfortunately, often times, when scientists try to speak or write about history, they make glaring mistakes.</p>



<p>For instance, I have already written extensively about how the 1980 television miniseries <em>Cosmos: A Personal Voyage</em>, written and presented by the astronomer and astrophysicist Carl Sagan,<em> </em><a href="http://talesoftimesforgotten.com/2020/02/05/carl-sagan-was-really-bad-at-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promoted all sorts of</a> egregious misconceptions <a href="http://talesoftimesforgotten.com/2018/08/06/who-was-hypatia-of-alexandria-really/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about the Neoplatonist philosopher Hypatia</a> and <a href="http://talesoftimesforgotten.com/2019/07/03/misconceptions-about-the-library-of-alexandria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about the supposed destruction of the Library of Alexandria</a>.</p>



<p>The book <em>The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined</em>, written by the linguist and psychologist Steven Pinker is one that has been bothering me for a long time. I promised that I would write an article about it in <a href="https://talesoftimesforgotten.com/2019/12/28/how-violent-was-the-pre-modern-world-really/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this article I wrote last year about violence in the pre-modern world</a>, but I have been holding back until now because I am aware of how popular the book is and what an impact it has had on so many people’s lives.</p>



<p>Bill Gates, for instance, described it in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122115732/http://www.thegatesnotes.com/Books/Personal/The-Better-Angels-of-Our-Nature" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a review</a> as “one of the most important books I’ve read – not just this year, but ever.” Unfortunately, this book is filled with all kinds of historical inaccuracies and I think it promotes some ideas that, while they may seem comforting in the short-term, are actually deleterious in the long-run.</p>



<p><strong>Pinker’s basic argument</strong></p>



<p>In case you are unfamiliar with the book, Pinker’s basic historical argument is that all of human history up until the Early Modern Period is a chronicle of superstition, backwardness, barbarity, and relentless, inhuman cruelty. He contends that life in the pre-modern world was, to quote Thomas Hobbes, whom Pinker displays a professed fondness for, “nasty, brutish, and short”; violence was an unavoidable part of everyday life and no one even considered the idea that it was bad.</p>



<p>Then, Pinker contends, in western Europe during the Early Modern Period, people started to become civilized and then the Enlightenment happened and everything has been getting better ever since. Pinker says that, over the past few centuries, humanity has made stunning and remarkable progress in all areas. According to Pinker, we are currently living in the best, most peaceful, most prosperous time in all of human history and things are only getting better overall.</p>



<p>It is easy to see why this story is so appealing. There is a rugged, Whiggish simplicity to it. Furthermore, it is a <em>comforting </em>narrative in which we are not only clearly superior to our ancestors in every way, but also clearly heading in the right direction. It is a real shame that this whole narrative is riddled with inaccuracies and oversimplifications.</p>



<p>Because I do not have time to write a response to Pinker’s entire book, I will focus this review primarily on the sections in the first few chapters dealing with ancient and medieval history. Before I get into it, though, I want to make very clear that I am not disputing Pinker’s argument that violence was generally more common in the ancient and medieval worlds than it is today. What I am disputing, however, is Pinker’s overall portrayal of the ancient and medieval worlds.</p>



<p>From reading Pinker’s book, one comes away with the impression that everyone in pre-modern times was a brutal monster, gratuitous violence was an extremely common, unavoidable part of everyday life, and no one even considered that things like rape, torture, and genocide might be wrong. This is very much an inaccurate portrayal that is rooted in Pinker’s extensive and largely uncritical reliance on a small number of unreliable sources and works of outright fiction.</p>

<p><em>ABOVE: Image of one version of the front cover of Pinker’s bestselling book</em></p>



<p><strong>Pinker’s assessment of prehistoric societies</strong></p>



<p>In his book, Pinker presents the traditionally widely accepted view that prehistoric nomadic societies were unbelievably violent and almost constantly at war. This is very much the traditional view that most scholars have had of prehistoric societies. Prehistory is not my main area of expertise, so I will not dwell on it too much, but I will note that the traditional view advanced by Pinker has been challenged in recent years.</p>



<p>For instance, here’s <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/341/6143/270" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a paper by Douglas Fry and Patrik Söderberg published in July 2013 </a>that looks at lethal aggression in twenty-one contemporary nomadic hunter-gatherer societies. The paper concludes that, in general, these societies are far less violent than has traditionally been thought. They also observe that most documented cases of lethal aggression in these societies were classifiable as homicides committed by a single person against another person and that actual wars between hunter-gatherer tribes were quite rare.</p>



<p>My view is that the data just isn’t clear enough to make any pronouncements about how violent prehistoric cultures were, since our evidence of these cultures is extremely limited. Also, we need to be willing to recognize that there may have been significant variation in how violent these societies were; just because <em>some</em> hunter-gatherer groups were extremely violent doesn’t mean they all were.</p>



<p><strong>Pinker’s assessment of ancient Greece</strong></p>



<p>Pinker’s description of ancient Greek warfare is almost totally reliant on the portrayal of war in the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>. The <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey </em>are, however, works of fiction and they are not in any sense accurate reflections of what warfare in archaic Greece was really like. Classicists have known this for at least a century.</p>



<p>For instance, as I discuss in <a href="http://talesoftimesforgotten.com/2019/03/13/did-the-trojan-war-really-happen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this article I wrote in March 2019 about the historicity of the Trojan War</a>, the author of the<em> Iliad </em>seems to have had no idea how chariots were used in Bronze Age warfare. At the time when the <em>Iliad</em> was composed, chariots were no longer used for warfare, but the author of the <em>Iliad</em> seems to have had a vague impression that they had been used for warfare at some point in the past.</p>



<p>Thus, the author of the <em>Iliad</em> imagines chariots being used almost like golf carts, with the warriors riding the chariots to the site of the battle and then disembarking in order to fight on foot in hand-to-hand combat. In historical reality, it seems that warriors who had chariots actually fought in those chariots. Indeed, that was the whole advantage of having a chariot. The <em>Iliad </em>therefore portrays chariots being used in warfare in a way that they were probably never really used.</p>



<p>Fantastic and mythological elements appear all throughout the <em>Iliad</em>. For instance, deities are constantly intervening in the conflict, Achilles’s horses Balios and Xanthos can talk, and heroes are described as lifting massive boulders that no man alive in the poet’s age could lift. In Book Twenty-One of the <em>Iliad</em>, Achilles literally fights a river god who is mad about him dumping so many corpses into his waters. These poems were composed for entertainment, not to accurately document what Bronze Age warfare was really like.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-05da7d3c3be414703c01282240ffaaa6" alt=""></figure></div>



<p><em>ABOVE: Painting of Achilleus fighting the god of the river Skamandros, a scene from Book Twenty-One of the </em>Iliad<em>, painted in 1737 by the French painter Charles-Antoine Coypel. The</em> Iliad <em>is primarily a work of fantasy, not of history.</em></p>



<p>Citing the<em> Iliad </em>and the <em>Odyssey</em> as evidence that archaic Greek culture was exceptionally violent is like citing modern violent films as proof that contemporary American society is exceptionally violent. Humans have <em>always</em> told stories involving graphic violence; we still tell stories involving graphic violence today and we will probably still be telling stories involving graphic violence in a thousand years. All that these stories prove is that humans in general have a fascination with stories of violence.</p>



<p>Pinker’s analysis of what life was like in ancient Greece relies heavily on Johnathan Gottschall, a literary scholar who, as best as I can tell, has no formal background in history or classical studies in particular. In the entire section, Pinker does not even reference a single ancient Greek historical source or a single classicist.</p>



<p>In response to the argument that ancient Greek warfare was generally less deadly than modern warfare because people in ancient Greece were fighting with spears and swords rather than with “machine guns, artillery, bombers, and other long-distance weaponry,” Pinker merely quotes a graphic description from Gottschall of people getting slaughtered with spears and dismisses the issue.</p>



<p>It baffles me that Pinker could somehow think this even constitutes an argument; one graphic description of slaughter from a modern literary critic based on the <em>Iliad</em>, a work of fiction, does not constitute as proof that a spear is as deadly as a machine gun.</p>



<p>Ironically, one piece of historical evidence that we can perhaps gather from the Homeric poems is that many of the original listeners of these poems had probably never seen an actual battle first-hand; the poet frequently describes men fighting using similes comparing them to everyday scenes from the natural world, especially of animals, which many scholars have suspected is because the poet was trying to conjure up images of what a battle might look like for those who had never seen one.</p>

<p><em>ABOVE: </em>A Reading from Homer<em>, painted in 1885 by the Dutch painter Lawrence Alma-Tadema</em></p>



<p>Now, of course, in historical reality, the ancient Greeks <em>were</em> capable of being quite violent, but I think Pinker’s portrayal leaves a rather significant misimpression of just how violent life in ancient Greece really was.</p>



<p>Archaic Greek warfare was much smaller-scale than modern warfare and, in most cases, probably resulted in a lot fewer deaths. Battles were usually rather small-scale, with armies most often being composed of only a few hundred men at most, and they were usually fought over land. It was not a common occurrence for a city to be sacked and burned like the …</p></div></div>

    <p>One of the first things we did in setting up the company was create a repo
named "rfd." This repo houses our requests for discussion. Bryan teased this to
the internet...</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">To the point of this piece, the first thing we actually built at <a href="https://twitter.com/oxidecomputer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@oxidecomputer</a> was infrastructure for design documentation and discussion -- which, like many problems, is peskier than it might seem! <a href="https://t.co/w8ecNNUN0I">https://t.co/w8ecNNUN0I</a></p>— Bryan Cantrill (@bcantrill) <a href="https://twitter.com/bcantrill/status/1286005213065703424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>...and folks asked for our process, so we are going to share it!</p>
<p>The best way to
describe RFDs is with "RFD 1 Requests for Discussion." Below is that RFD.</p>

<p>Writing down ideas is important:  it allows them to be rigorously formulated
(even while nascent), candidly discussed and transparently shared.
We capture the written expression of an idea in a <strong>Request for Discussion</strong>
(RFD), a document in the original spirit of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments">IETF Request for Comments</a>,
as expressed by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3">RFC 3</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The content of a note may be any thought, suggestion, etc.
related to the software or other aspect of the network.
Notes are encouraged to be timely rather than polished.
Philosophical positions without examples or other specifics, specific suggestions
or implementation techniques without introductory or background explication, and
explicit questions without any attempted answers are all acceptable.
The minimum length for a note is one sentence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These standards (or lack of them) are stated explicitly for two reasons.
First, there is a tendency to view a written statement as ipso facto authoritative,
and we hope to promote the exchange and discussion of considerably less than
authoritative ideas.
Second, there is a natural hesitancy to publish something unpolished,
and we hope to ease this inhibition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar to RFCs, our philosophy of RFDs is to allow both timely discussion of
rough ideas, while still becoming a permanent repository for more established ones.
Depending on their state, RFDs may be quickly iterated on in a branch,
discussed actively as part of a pull request to be merged, or commented upon
after having been published.
The workflow for the RFD process for is based upon those of the Golang
proposal process, Joyent RFD process, Rust RFC process, and Kubernetes
proposal process.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-an-rfd">When to use an RFD</h2>
<p>The following are examples of when an RFD is appropriate, these are intended to
be broad:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add or change a company process</li>
<li>An architectural or design decision for hardware or software</li>
<li>Change to an API or command-line tool used by customers</li>
<li>Change to an internal API or tool</li>
<li>Change to an internal process</li>
<li>A design for testing</li>
</ul>
<p>RFDs not only apply to technical ideas but overall company ideas and processes
as well.
If you have an idea to improve the way something is being done as a company,
you have the power to make your voice heard by adding to discussion.</p>

<p>At the start of every RFD document, we'd like to include a brief amount of metadata.
The metadata format is based on the
<a href="https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/metadata">python-markdown2</a> metadata format.
It'd look like:</p>
<pre><code>---
authors: Andy Smith &lt;andy@example.computer&gt;, Neal Jones &lt;neal@example.computer&gt;
state: prediscussion
---
</code></pre>
<p>We keep track of three pieces of metadata:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>authors</code>: The authors (and therefore owners) of an RFD.
They should be listed with their name and e-mail address.</li>
<li><code>state</code>: Must be one of the states discussed below.</li>
<li><code>discussion</code>: For RFDs that are in or beyond the <code>discussion</code> state, this should be a link to the PR to integrate the RFD;
see below for details.</li>
</ol>
<p>An RFD can be in one of the following six states:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>prediscussion</code></li>
<li><code>ideation</code></li>
<li><code>discussion</code></li>
<li><code>published</code></li>
<li><code>committed</code></li>
<li><code>abandoned</code></li>
</ol>
<p>A document in the <code>prediscussion</code> state indicates that the work is not yet
ready for discussion, but that the RFD is effectively a placeholder.
The <code>prediscussion</code> state signifies that work iterations are being done
quickly on the RFD in its branch in order to advance the RFD to the <code>discussion</code> state.</p>
<p>A document in the <code>ideation</code> state contains only a description of the topic
that the RFD will cover, providing an indication of the scope of the eventual
RFD. Unlike the <code>prediscussion</code> state, there is no expectation that is
undergoing active revision. Such a document is scratchpad for related ideas.
Any member of the team is encouraging to start active development of such an
RFD (moving it to the prediscussion state) with or without the participation
of the original author. It is critical that RFDs in the <code>ideation</code> state are
clear and narrowly defined.</p>
<p>Documents under active discussion should be in the <code>discussion</code> state.
At this point a discussion is being had for the RFD in a Pull Request.</p>
<p>Once (or if) discussion has converged and the Pull Request is ready to be merged,
it should be updated to the <code>published</code> state before merge.
Note that just because something is in the <code>published</code> state does not mean that
it cannot be updated and corrected.
See the  <a href="#making-changes-to-an-rfd">Making changes to an RFD</a> section for more
information.</p>
<p>The <code>prediscussion</code> state should be viewed as essentially a collaborative
extension of an engineer's notebook, and the <code>discussion</code> state should be used
when an idea is being actively discussed.
These states shouldn't be used for ideas that have been committed to,
organizationally or otherwise;
by the time an idea represents the consensus or direction, it should be in
the <code>published</code> state.</p>
<p>Once an idea has been entirely implemented, it should be in the <code>committed</code> state.
Comments on ideas in the <code>committed</code> state should generally be raised as issues --
but if the comment represents a call for a significant divergence from or
extension to committed functionality, a new RFD may be called for;
as in all things, use your best judgment.</p>
<p>Finally, if an idea is found to be non-viable (that is, deliberately never
implemented) or if an RFD should be otherwise indicated that it should be
ignored, it can be moved into the <code>abandoned</code> state.</p>
<p>We will go over this in more detail.
Let's walk through the life of a RFD.</p>
<h2 id="rfd-life-cycle">RFD life-cycle</h2>
<p>There is a <em>prototype</em> script in this repository, <code>scripts/new.sh</code>, that will
automate the process.</p>
<pre><code>$ scripts/new.sh 0042 "My title here"
</code></pre>
<p>If you wish to create a new RFD by hand, or understand the process in greater
detail, read on.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Never at anytime through the process do you push directly to the
master branch. Once your pull request (PR) with your RFD in your branch is
merged into master, then the RFD will appear in the master branch.</p>
<h3 id="reserve-a-rfd-number">Reserve a RFD number</h3>
<p>You will first need to reserve the number you wish to use for your RFC.
This number should be the next available RFD number from looking at the
current <code>git branch -r</code> output.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-branch-for-your-rfd">Create a branch for your RFD</h3>
<p>Now you will need to create a new git branch, named after the RFD number you wish to reserve.
This number should have leading zeros if less than 4 digits.
Before creating the branch, verify that it does not already exist:</p>
<pre><code>$ git branch -rl *0042
</code></pre>
<p>If you see a branch there (but not a corresponding sub-directory in <code>rfd</code> in
master), it is possible that the RFD is currently being created;
stop and check with co-workers before proceeding!
Once you have verified that the branch doesn't exist, create it locally and
switch to it:</p>
<pre><code>$ git checkout -b 0042
</code></pre>
<h3 id="create-a-placeholder-rfd">Create a placeholder RFD</h3>
<p>Now create a placeholder RFD.
You can do so with the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir -p rfd/0042
$ cp prototypes/prototype.md rfd/0042/README.md
# OR IF YOU PREFER asciidoc
$ cp prototypes/prototype.adoc rfd/0042/README.adoc
</code></pre>
<p>Fill in the RFD number and title placeholders in the new doc and add your name as an author.
The status of the RFD at this point should be <code>prediscussion</code>.</p>
<p>If your preference is to use asciidoc, that is acceptable as well, however the examples in this flow will assume markdown.</p>
<h3 id="push-your-rfd-branch-remotely">Push your RFD branch remotely</h3>
<p>Push your changes to your RFD branch in the RFD repo.</p>
<pre><code>$ git add rfd/0042/README.md
$ git commit -m '0042: Adding placeholder for RFD &lt;Title&gt;'
$ git push origin 0042
</code></pre>
<p>After your branch is pushed, the table in the README on the master branch will
update automatically with the new RFD. If you ever change the name of the RFD in the future,
the table will update as well. Whenever information about the state of the RFD
changes, this updates the table as well. The single source of truth for
information about the RFD comes from the RFD in the branch until it is merged.</p>
<h3 id="iterate-on-your-rfd-in-your-branch">Iterate on your RFD in your branch</h3>
<p>Now, you can work on writing your RFD in your branch.</p>
<pre><code>$ git checkout 0042
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can gather your thoughts and get your RFD to a state where you would
like to get feedback and discuss with others.
It's recommended to push your branch remotely to make sure the changes you make
stay in sync with the remote in case your local gets damaged.</p>
<p>It is up to you as to whether you would like to squash all your commits down to
one before opening up for feedback, or if you would like to keep the commit
history for the sake of history.</p>
<h3 id="discuss-your-rfd">Discuss your RFD</h3>
<p>When you are ready to get feedback on your RFD, make sure all your local
changes are pushed to the remote branch.
At this point you are likely at the stage where you will want to change the
status of the RFD from <code>prediscussion</code> to <code>discussion</code> for a fully formed
RFD or to <code>ideation</code> for one where only the topic is specified.
Do this in your branch.</p>
<h3 id="push-your-rfd-branch-remotely-2">Push your RFD branch remotely</h3>
<p>Along with your RFD content, update the RFD's state to <code>discussion</code> in your branch, then:</p>
<pre><code>$ git commit -am '0042: Add RFD for &lt;Title&gt;'
$ git push origin 0042
</code></pre>
<h3 id="open-a-pull-request">Open a Pull Request</h3>
<p>Open a pull request on GitHub to merge your branch, in this case <code>0042</code> into the master branch.</p>
<p>If you move your RFD into <code>discussion</code> but fail to open a pull request, a friendly
bot will do it for you. …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>I have to tell you about the Kalman filter, because what it does is pretty damn amazing.</p>
<p>Surprisingly few software engineers and scientists seem to know about it, and that makes me sad because it is such a general and powerful tool for <strong>combining information</strong> in the presence of uncertainty. At times its ability to extract accurate information seems almost magical— and if it sounds like I’m talking this up too much, then take a look at <a href="https://www.bzarg.com/p/improving-imu-attitude-estimates-with-velocity-data">this previously posted video</a> where I demonstrate a Kalman filter figuring out the <em>orientation</em> of a free-floating body by looking at its <em>velocity</em>. Totally neat!</p>

<p>You can use a Kalman filter in any place where you have <strong>uncertain information</strong> about some dynamic system, and you can make an <strong>educated guess</strong> about what the system is going to do next. Even if messy reality comes along and interferes with the clean motion you guessed about, the Kalman filter will often do a very good job of figuring out what actually happened. And it can take advantage of correlations between crazy phenomena that you maybe wouldn’t have thought to exploit!</p>
<p>Kalman filters are ideal for systems which are <strong>continuously changing</strong>. They have the <span id="more-491"></span>advantage that they are light on memory (they don’t need to keep any history other than the previous state), and they are very fast, making them well suited for real time problems and embedded systems.</p>
<p>The math for implementing the Kalman filter appears pretty scary and opaque in most places you find on Google. That’s a bad state of affairs, because the Kalman filter is actually super simple and easy to understand if you look at it in the right way. Thus it makes a great article topic, and I will attempt to illuminate it with lots of clear, pretty pictures and colors. The prerequisites are simple; all you need is a basic understanding of probability and matrices.</p>
<p>I’ll start with a loose example of the kind of thing a Kalman filter can solve, but if you want to get right to the shiny pictures and math, feel free to <a href="#mathybits">jump ahead</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s make a toy example: You’ve built a little robot that can wander around in the woods, and the robot needs to know exactly where it is so that it can navigate.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/robot_forest-300x160.png" alt="Your little robot" width="300" height="160" srcset="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/robot_forest-300x160.png 300w, https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/robot_forest.png 553w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>We’ll say our robot has a state \( \vec{x_k} \), which is just a position and a velocity:</p>
<p>\(\vec{x_k} = (\vec{p}, \vec{v})\)</p>
<p>Note that the state is just a list of numbers about the underlying configuration of your system; it could be anything. In our example it’s position and velocity, but it could be data about the amount of fluid in a tank, the temperature of a car engine, the position of a user’s finger on a touchpad, or any number of things you need to keep track of.</p>
<p>Our robot also has a GPS sensor, which is accurate to about 10 meters, which is good, but it needs to know its location more precisely than 10 meters. There are lots of gullies and cliffs in these woods, and if the robot is wrong by more than a few feet, it could fall off a cliff. So GPS by itself is not good enough.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/robot_ohnoes.png"><img src="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/robot_ohnoes-300x283.png" alt="Oh no." width="300" height="283" srcset="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/robot_ohnoes-300x283.png 300w, https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/robot_ohnoes.png 403w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>We might also know something about how the robot moves: It knows the commands sent to the wheel motors, and its knows that if it’s headed in one direction and nothing interferes, at the next instant it will likely be further along that same direction. But of course it doesn’t know everything about its motion: It might be buffeted by the wind, the wheels might slip a little bit, or roll over bumpy terrain; so the amount the wheels have turned might not exactly represent how far the robot has actually traveled, and the prediction won’t be perfect.</p>
<p>The GPS <strong>sensor</strong> tells us something about the state, but only indirectly, and with some uncertainty or inaccuracy. Our <strong>prediction</strong> tells us something about how the robot is moving, but only indirectly, and with some uncertainty or inaccuracy.</p>
<p>But if we use all the information available to us, can we get a better answer than <strong>either estimate would give us by itself</strong>? Of course the answer is yes, and that’s what a Kalman filter is for.</p>


<p>Let’s look at the landscape we’re trying to interpret. We’ll continue with a simple state having only position and velocity. $$<br>
\vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix}<br>
p\\<br>
v<br>
\end{bmatrix}$$</p>
<p>We don’t know what the <em>actual</em> position and velocity are; there are a whole range of possible combinations of position and velocity that might be true, but some of them are more likely than others:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_0.png" alt="gauss_0" width="310" height="325" srcset="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_0.png 621w, https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_0-287x300.png 287w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px"></p>
<p>The Kalman filter assumes that both variables (postion and velocity, in our case) are random and <em>Gaussian distributed.</em> Each variable has a <strong>mean</strong> value \(\mu\), which is the center of the random distribution (and its most likely state), and a <strong>variance</strong> \(\sigma^2\), which is the uncertainty:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_1.png" alt="gauss_1" width="310" height="276" srcset="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_1.png 621w, https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_1-300x267.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px"></p>
<p>In the above picture, position and velocity are <strong>uncorrelated</strong>, which means that the state of one variable tells you nothing about what the other might be.</p>
<p>The example below shows something more interesting: Position and velocity are <strong>correlated</strong>. The likelihood of observing a particular position depends on what velocity you have:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_3.png" alt="gauss_3" width="310" height="286" srcset="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_3.png 621w, https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_3-300x276.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px">This kind of situation might arise if, for example, we are estimating a new position based on an old one. If our velocity was high, we probably moved farther, so our position will be more distant. If we’re moving slowly, we didn’t get as far.</p>
<p>This kind of relationship is really important to keep track of, because it gives us <strong>more information: </strong>One measurement tells us something about what the others could be. And that’s the goal of the Kalman filter, we want to squeeze as much information from our uncertain measurements as we possibly can!</p>
<p>This correlation is captured by something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_matrix">covariance matrix</a>. In short, each element of the matrix \(\Sigma_{ij}\) is the degree of correlation between the <em>ith</em> state variable and the <em>jth</em> state variable. (You might be able to guess that the covariance matrix is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_matrix">symmetric</a>, which means that it doesn’t matter if you swap <em>i</em> and <em>j</em>). Covariance matrices are often labelled “\(\mathbf{\Sigma}\)”, so we call their elements “\(\Sigma_{ij}\)”.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_2.png" alt="gauss_2" width="310" height="286" srcset="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_2.png 621w, https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_2-300x276.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px"></p>

<p>We’re modeling our knowledge about the state as a Gaussian blob, so we need two pieces of information at time \(k\): We’ll call our best estimate \(\mathbf{\hat{x}_k}\) (the mean, elsewhere named \(\mu\) ), and its covariance matrix \(\mathbf{P_k}\). $$<br>
\begin{equation} \label{eq:statevars}<br>
\begin{aligned}<br>
\mathbf{\hat{x}}_k &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}<br>
\text{position}\\<br>
\text{velocity}<br>
\end{bmatrix}\\<br>
\mathbf{P}_k &amp;=<br>
\begin{bmatrix}<br>
\Sigma_{pp} &amp; \Sigma_{pv} \\<br>
\Sigma_{vp} &amp; \Sigma_{vv} \\<br>
\end{bmatrix}<br>
\end{aligned}<br>
\end{equation}<br>
$$</p>
<p>(Of course we are using only position and velocity here, but it’s useful to remember that the state can contain any number of variables, and represent anything you want).</p>
<p>Next, we need some way to look at the <span><strong>current state</strong></span> (at time <span><strong>k-1</strong></span>) and <strong>predict the <span>next state</span></strong> at time <span><strong>k</strong></span>. Remember, we don’t know which state is the “real” one, but our prediction function doesn’t care. It just works on <em>all of them</em>, and gives us a new distribution:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_7.jpg" alt="gauss_7" width="310" height="286" srcset="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_7.jpg 621w, https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_7-300x276.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px">We can represent this prediction step with a matrix, \(\mathbf{F_k}\):</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_8.jpg" alt="gauss_8" width="310" height="286" srcset="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_8.jpg 621w, https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_8-300x276.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px">It takes <em>every point</em> in our original estimate and moves it to a new predicted location, which is where the system would move if that original estimate was the right one.</p>
<p>Let’s apply this. How would we use a matrix to predict the position and velocity at the next moment in the future? We’ll use a really basic kinematic formula:$$<br>
\begin{split}<br>
\color{deeppink}{p_k} &amp;= \color{royalblue}{p_{k-1}} + \Delta t &amp;\color{royalblue}{v_{k-1}} \\<br>
\color{deeppink}{v_k} &amp;= &amp;\color{royalblue}{v_{k-1}}<br>
\end{split}<br>
$$ In other words: $$<br>
\begin{align}<br>
\color{deeppink}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_k} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}<br>
1 &amp; \Delta t \\<br>
0 &amp; 1<br>
\end{bmatrix} \color{royalblue}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{k-1}} \\<br>
&amp;= \mathbf{F}_k \color{royalblue}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{k-1}} \label{statevars}<br>
\end{align}<br>
$$</p>
<p>We now have a <strong>prediction matrix</strong> which gives us our next state, but we still don’t know how to update the covariance matrix.</p>
<p>This is where we need another formula. If we multiply every point in a distribution by a matrix \(\color{firebrick}{\mathbf{A}}\), then what happens to its covariance matrix \(\Sigma\)?</p>
<p>Well, it’s easy. I’ll just give you the identity:$$<br>
\begin{equation}<br>
\begin{split}<br>
Cov(x) &amp;= \Sigma\\<br>
Cov(\color{firebrick}{\mathbf{A}}x) &amp;= \color{firebrick}{\mathbf{A}} \Sigma \color{firebrick}{\mathbf{A}}^T<br>
\end{split} \label{covident}<br>
\end{equation}<br>
$$</p>
<p>So combining \(\eqref{covident}\) with equation \(\eqref{statevars}\):$$<br>
\begin{equation}<br>
\begin{split}<br>
\color{deeppink}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_k} &amp;= \mathbf{F}_k \color{royalblue}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{k-1}} \\<br>
\color{deeppink}{\mathbf{P}_k} &amp;= \mathbf{F_k} \color{royalblue}{\mathbf{P}_{k-1}} \mathbf{F}_k^T<br>
\end{split}<br>
\end{equation}<br>
$$</p>
<h2>External influence</h2>
<p>We haven’t captured everything, though. There might be some changes that <strong>aren’t related to the state</strong> itself— the outside world could be affecting the system.</p>
<p>For example, if the state models the motion of a train, the train operator might push on the throttle, causing the train to accelerate. Similarly, in our robot example, the navigation software might issue a command to turn the wheels or stop. If we know this additional information about what’s going on in the world, we could stuff it into a vector called \(\color{darkorange}{\vec{\mathbf{u}_k}}\), do something with it, and add it to our prediction as a correction.</p>
<p>Let’s say we know the expected acceleration \(\color{darkorange}{a}\) due to the throttle setting or control commands. From basic kinematics we get: $$<br>
\begin{split}<br>
\color{deeppink}{p_k} &amp;= \color{royalblue}{p_{k-1}} + {\Delta t} &amp;\color{royalblue}{v_{k-1}} + &amp;\frac{1}{2} \color{darkorange}{a} {\Delta t}^2 \\<br>
\color{deeppink}{v_k} &amp;= &amp;\color{royalblue}{v_{k-1}} + &amp; \color{darkorange}{a} {\Delta t}<br>
\end{split}<br>
$$ In matrix form: $$<br>
\begin{equation}<br>
\begin{split}<br>
\color{deeppink}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_k} &amp;= \mathbf{F}_k \color{royalblue}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{k-1}} + \begin{bmatrix}<br>
\frac{\Delta t^2}{2} \\<br>
\Delta t<br>
\end{bmatrix} \color{darkorange}{a} \\<br>
&amp;= \mathbf{F}_k …</p></div></div>

<p>In this post I will discuss some testing techniques for internal red teams to identify privacy issues in services and infrastructure, most importantly a simple three step approach that might uncover interesting results.</p>

<h2 id="background-story">Background story</h2>

<p>First, let me share a story from the past. When I did my master’s I built an app that performs end to end encryption of Facebook posts. This means that only the intended audience for which your posts were encrypted for can decipher the posts.</p>

<p>The project was called Project Cryptbook, and I found an old screnshot again:</p>

<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/cryptbook.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/cryptbook.png" alt="Project Cryptbook"></a></p>

<p>On the left you see the UI in the app which shows the clear text. And on the right, you see what everyone else, including Facebook sees.</p>

<p>That was about 10+ years ago - interesting how time flies. Facebook replaced the “wall” with an ad-driven timeline and Windows Phone is dead.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I have always been a fan of privacy, data protection and giving user’s control over their data.</p>

<h2 id="red-teaming-for-privacy">Red Teaming for privacy!</h2>

<p>When years later I oversaw planning and performing large red team operations I thought quite a bit on how to help organizations improve their understanding of privacy threats with practical excersices. It became even more interesting when new regulations started kicking in.</p>

<p><strong>Does your organization have procedures in place to regularly assess systems and infrastructure for privacy violations?</strong></p>

<p>Article 32 of the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legalcontent/EN/TXT/?qid=1528874672298&amp;uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> highlights the requirement and necessity to test regularly when processing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“a process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of processing.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even for privacy minded folks and organizations, there is little information available on how to perform privacy testing nor is there much literature out there (to my knowledge). Chances are you might have not even thought about privacy focused testing before.</p>

<p><a href="https://gdpr.eu/"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/gdpr.png" alt="GDPR Logo"></a></p>

<p>Let’s dive into the threats of data and motivated intruder.</p>

<h2 id="data-intruder-threat">Data Intruder Threat</h2>

<p>Privacy violations are often insider threats. Employees who have access to production and PII data can easily exfiltrate large amounts of data or be coerced into doing so by an adversary.</p>

<p>In more mature organizations such access is only granted on a case-by-case basis and temporarily for support, debugging or when security incidents arise. And access to the systems and data records is <em>(should be)</em> monitored thoroughly.</p>

<h3 id="easy-access-to-customer-data">Easy access to customer data?</h3>

<p>How difficult is it for a developer, a marketing person, support personnel, a data scientist, or someone from HR to access customer data?</p>

<p><strong>Are access requests possibly auto-approved!?</strong></p>

<p>The data intruder threat is important as more and more of the world’s data is being stored in the cloud. Insiders indeed exploit their privileges at times, for instance: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-cyber-access-exclusive-idUSKCN24O34E">Twitter (2020)</a>, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/facebook-investigating-claim-engineer-used-access-stalk-women-n870526">Facebook (2018)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/14/google-engineer-fired-security/">Google (2010)</a>.</p>

<p>How is the situation in your organization?</p>

<p>Ideally, customers should be notified whenever employees or contractors access their information through support, maintenance, or bug fixes. That would set a high standard for ethics in the industry.</p>

<p>What safeguards are in place to prevent anyone from downloading the customer database, copying it onto a USB device to exfiltrate, sell the information, or take it home when departing the company?</p>

<h2 id="motivated-intruder">Motivated Intruder</h2>

<p>Furthermore, NIST highlights the <strong>Motivated Intruder</strong> as being an internal adversary who has access to <strong>anonymized datasets and uses data science techniques to <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/sp/800-188/archive/2016-08-25/documents/sp800_188_draft.pdf">reidentify and deanonymize the data</a></strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/hacker.png" alt="Hacker"></p>

<p>I have been using the term <strong>Motivated Intruder</strong> in a broader sense for any privacy focused red teaming operations throughout my career.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-with-privacy-focused-testing">Getting started with privacy focused testing</h2>

<p>There are some basic ways to test and identify privacy violations in your organization.</p>

<p>Here are a couple ideas for operations, such as:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Identifying customer data in widely accessible locations</strong>. For various reasons PII might end up accidentally in widely accessible telemetry, source code, logs, event streams, shared email inboxes, data science notebooks,…</li>
<li><strong>Simulate a Data Intruder who can legitimately gain access to customer data for business purposes</strong> and exfiltrate sentinel records to validate monitoring solutions</li>
<li><strong>Exploit a system vulnerability</strong> or weakness to gain access to customer data</li>
<li>Perform <strong>de-anonymization attacks</strong> - teaming up with data scientists during red team operations</li>
</ol>

<p>In this post I will be focusing on the first two scenarios.</p>

<p>Discuss with compliance and legal teams before engaging with them to ensure you have a well-rounded and authorized test plan in place.</p>

<h2 id="scenario-1-identifying-customer-data-in-widely-accessible-locations">Scenario 1: Identifying customer data in widely accessible locations</h2>

<p>I am a fan of creating sentinel datasets and have the red team find and exfiltrate those as objective.</p>

<p><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/background.filler.png" alt="background"></p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-sentinel-record">What is a sentinel record?</h3>

<p>A sentinel data record is basically a test record, often with an easily identifiable pattern.</p>

<p>Sentinel data records are useful for privacy focused testing. One way to get basic end-to-end test coverage is to use your own systems as an external user:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Data creation with unique patterns</strong> - Sign up with a unique and easily identifiable pattern as PII</li>
<li><strong>Exercising features</strong> of the system under test - Then exercise and use all the features of the system to trigger various workflows internally</li>
<li><strong>Hunting for patterns in internal systems</strong> - Finally, switch hats and search internally in widely accessible places for that <strong>unique pattern</strong></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="how-does-this-work-practically">How does this work practically?</h3>

<p>Let’s say your organization runs a service that allows users to register with their first name, last name, address, and credit card, and users can upload text and comments. Let’s walk through a test scenario step by step.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-data-creation-with-unique-easily-identifiable-patterns">Step 1: Data creation with unique, easily identifiable patterns</h3>

<p>In a practical fashion, this could be as simple as the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>As username, pick <strong>John55444562200</strong> <strong>Tester55444562200</strong></li>
<li>The address could be <strong>Test Road55444562200</strong></li>
<li>Credit card contains <strong>55444562200</strong> as well</li>
<li>Phone number contains  <strong>55444562200</strong></li>
<li>The email address contains it, for instance <strong>johntester+55444562200</strong>@example.org</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>You get the idea!</strong></p>

<h3 id="step-2-exercising-features">Step 2: Exercising features</h3>

<p>After creating test data, use the system and its features. Consider triggering side conditions and error cases to get a wide range of test cases. Upload/post/edit/delete information in the same using the pattern <strong>55444562200</strong>.</p>

<p>There is also the opportunity to automate and leverage already existing test frameworks to become more repeatable and have better test coverage.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-hunting-phase">Step 3: Hunting phase</h3>

<p>Afterward, it is time to hunt for the <em>specific</em> string pattern - in this case for <strong>55444562200</strong>.</p>

<p>This means searching various data stores and widely accessible information repositories for the pattern that used during signup.</p>

<p><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/lookfor.png" alt="Searching"></p>

<p>At this stage there is <strong>no</strong> need to actively compromise systems - ideally you just define a scope of systems to analyze upfront. Searching widely accessible <strong>telemetry stores</strong> and <strong>supposedly anonymized datasets in data lakes</strong> is a good place to start.</p>

<p>Some surprise hits might also be visible in places like <strong>internal source code repositories</strong> - maybe a data scientists checks in customer data when building or analyzing models, and of course our very own <strong>security monitoring solutions</strong> might contain the pattern as well. Other places are <strong>Intranet portals</strong>, <strong>file servers</strong> and <strong>O365/SharePoint/GSuite</strong>.</p>

<p>Using this simple technique, it’s possible to raise awareness and identify potential privacy violations and improve the overall security posture. It also helps protect the organization from certain data intruder threats.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can also do a privacy hunt without creating sentinel records. For instance searching for regular expression of phone numbers, email addresses or credit card numbers can help identify sensitive datasets in widely exposed locations pretty quickly.</p>

<h3 id="scenario-2-malicious-insider-and-privacy-implications">Scenario 2: Malicious insider and privacy implications</h3>

<p>When troubleshooting issues and debugging purposes, as well as security investigations, it is likely that engineers in your organization can request access to production machines where they might be exposed to customer data. In less mature organizations the process might be even simpler - and the question is if auditing is taking place. This is an important angle to validate as a red team.</p>

<p><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/number.png" alt="Numbers"></p>

<p>What if someone legitimately gains that level of access to debug a performance problem but at the same time exfiltrates customer data on a production system?</p>

<p>Would the blue team detect that? Is there enough logging in place to figure out what happened?</p>

<p>The actual data to exfiltrate can again be sentinel production records. This is to avoid having the red team touch real customer data – which is always preferable. Although, as a safety pre-caution red teamer must have proper authorization if they get exposed to customer data during testing (and yes, red teams have to be audited also). Discuss your testing objectives and approach with your legal counsel to ensure its legitimate and authorized.</p>

<p><strong>In the end, I think that an organization has to engage in privacy testing to help protect customer data and to demonstrate adhering to privacy regulation.</strong></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this post we discussed how Red Teams can help identify privacy violations by performing motivated intruder testing. We also learned about the Data Intruder and walked through some basic test techniques to help identify and minimize risk associated with accidently leaking customer data.</p>

<p>Hope this was interesting and useful. If you kick off such tests in your organization, I’d be curious to learn about findings or other approaches and ideas you might have.</p>

        <p>If you’ve heard the news about the nRF9160 then you know it’s a game-changer. ARM Cortex M33 + LTE Cat-M + NB-IoT and GPS all included under one System in Package. Drool-worthy, right?</p>

<p>Well, if you’ve been using the nRF SDK to build nRF5x projects, you likely feel like you’re hanging from your toes. That’s because Nordic has chosen to adopt Zephyr as their RTOS of choice for the nRF9160.</p>

<p>Although there is <a href="https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/">plenty of documentation about Zephyr</a>, making the transition can still be tough. Many nRF SDK enthusiasts will find themselves lost in a sea of CMake files and Kconfigs. I’m here to help with that!</p>

<p>This is the guide I wish existed while I was developing some drivers for the <a href="https://www.jaredwolff.com/store/nrf91-feather/">nRF9160 Feather</a>. I spent weeks getting accustomed to how Zephyr worked, figuring out what files needed to be where, and how the heck to include a header file. (Fun times.)</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->
<p>In this post, I’ll go over some of the nuances related to creating drivers for your peripherals on Zephyr. We’ll talk about Device Tree organization, <code>Kconfig</code>, and <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> files. By the end, you should have an idea on how to tackle your own Zephyr driver aspirations!

<h2 id="example-walkthrough">Example Walkthrough</h2>

<p>In this example, you’ll learn about what it takes to create a driver for the PCF85063A real-time clock and counter. I’ve chosen to use the counter API for reasons we’ll discuss in a bit. There are some prerequisites to getting started though. Let’s begin with SDK Setup.</p>

<h3 id="sdk-setup">SDK Setup</h3>

<p>I’ll be referencing Nordic’s nRF Connect SDK a bunch throughout this post. I’ve been building and testing nRF9160 Feather on v1.3.0. I won’t be going into detail on how to set up the SDK though. Nordic has <a href="https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/getting_started.html">great documentation</a> you can check out to get started. I’ve also discussed <a href="https://www.jaredwolff.com/zephyr-on-nrf9160-feather/">my experience here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-west-can-do-for-you">What <code>west</code> can do for you</h3>

<p>The Zephyr project uses a CLI tool, <code>west</code>, for project management, compilation, and flashing. <code>west</code> replaces the idea of a top-level Makefile and project dependency management like Git submodules. For the most part, it accomplishes that goal well.</p>

<p>You’ll need to install <code>west</code> if you haven’t already. Follow the SDK setup links above for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Building</strong></p>

<p>To build a project, navigate to the directory for the application in question and run <code>west build</code>. For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span><span>cd </span>ncs/nrf/samples/nrf9160/nrf_cloud_agps
<span>$</span><span> </span>west build <span>-b</span> circuitdojo_feather_nrf9160ns <span>-p</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This builds in the current folder for the <code>circuitdojo_feather_nrf9160ns</code> board. You can find all the possible <code>arm</code> based boards in <code>ncs/zephyr/boards/arm/</code> The <code>-p</code> flag tells <code>west</code> to clean before building.</p>

<p>A ton of things happen in the background to build a project. We’ll discuss more how things compile in the next section.</p>

<p><strong>Flashing</strong></p>

<p>Flashing code is as simple as running <code>west flash</code> from your project directory. You can use the <code>-r</code> parameter to choose which programming method you’d like to use. Common options are <code>jlink</code>, <code>nrfjprog</code> (for Nordic projects), <code>pyocd</code>, <code>openocd</code>, <code>dfu-util</code>, etc.</p>

<p>These “runners” are set in the board configuration. Here’s the <code>board.cmake</code> for the nRF9160 Feather located in <code>zephyr/boards/arm/circuitdojo_feather_nrf9160/board.cmake</code>:</p>

<p>As you can see, the nRF9160 Feather supports the <code>nrfjprog</code> and <code>jlink</code> options.</p>

<h2 id="dependency-management">Dependency Management</h2>

<p>There are a few different ways of handling dependencies in firmware land. I’ve used Git submodules as my dependency “manager” of choice. Zephyr though, is very opinionated on how you should work with your dependencies. Let’s look into how we do that with <code>west</code> and a <code>west.yml</code> file.</p>

<p><code>west.yml</code> is a manifest file much like a <code>Cargo.toml</code> in rust or <code>package.json</code> for Node. You initialize a Zephyr repository using <code>west init</code> command. This does a shallow <code>git</code> clone for each dependency and puts them into place.</p>

<p>Here’s what a <code>west.yml</code> file may look like. This was for a personal project that uses <a href="https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb">NanoPB</a> and also the nRF Connect SDK.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>manifest</span><span>:</span>
  <span>remotes</span><span>:</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>nrfconnect</span>
      <span>url-base</span><span>:</span> <span>https://github.com/nrfconnect</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>nanopb</span>
      <span>url-base</span><span>:</span> <span>https://github.com/nanopb</span>
  <span>projects</span><span>:</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>nrf</span>
      <span>remote</span><span>:</span> <span>nrfconnect</span>
      <span>revision</span><span>:</span> <span>v1.3.0</span>
      <span>import</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>nanopb</span>
      <span>repo-path</span><span>:</span> <span>nanopb</span>
      <span>revision</span><span>:</span> <span>0.3.9</span>
      <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>pyrinas/ext/nanopb</span>
      <span>remote</span><span>:</span> <span>nanopb</span>
  <span>self</span><span>:</span>
    <span># This repository should be cloned to ncs/nrf.</span>
    <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>pyrinas</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>west.yml</code> file doesn’t affect driver operation. If you’re going to include your drivers as a separate repo though, this is where you would add it! You can learn more though by going to the Zephyr documentation on <a href="https://docs.zephyrproject.org/1.14.1/guides/west/manifest.html">West Manifests</a>. (complete with crazy dependency diagrams and more!)</p>

<h2 id="how-things-compile">How Things Compile</h2>

<p>One of the important things to know about driver development is how things compile. It may bend your mind a bit but we’ll get through this together.</p>

<h3 id="cmakeliststxt"><code>CMakeLists.txt</code></h3>

<p>If you spend enough time in Zephyr, you may see some patterns emerge. Many folders and sub-folders have this dynamic duo: <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> and <code>Kconfig</code>. These files are where all the magic happens.</p>

<p>You may already have an idea of what <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> does by its name. It’s a Makefile of sorts that you use to add source files and include folders to a project. The neat thing about <code>cmake</code> is that it’s recursive (for better or for worse). This means a higher-level <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file spells out what, if anything, can be found in subdirectories. There are no more ginormous Makefiles. You make the changes you need closest to the code that’s affected.</p>

<p>For example, you can add subdirectories in <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> so they’re part of the <code>cmake</code> path:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Point to NCS root directory.</span>
<span>set</span><span>(</span>NRF_DIR <span>${</span><span>CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR</span><span>}</span> CACHE PATH <span>"NCS root directory"</span><span>)</span>

<span>include</span><span>(</span>cmake/extensions.cmake<span>)</span>
<span>include</span><span>(</span>cmake/multi_image.cmake<span>)</span>
<span>include</span><span>(</span>cmake/reports.cmake<span>)</span>

<span>zephyr_include_directories</span><span>(</span>include<span>)</span>

<span>add_subdirectory</span><span>(</span>ext<span>)</span>
<span>add_subdirectory</span><span>(</span>lib<span>)</span>
<span>add_subdirectory</span><span>(</span>samples<span>)</span>
<span>add_subdirectory</span><span>(</span>subsys<span>)</span>
<span>add_subdirectory</span><span>(</span>drivers<span>)</span>
<span>add_subdirectory</span><span>(</span>tests<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Sometimes they’re used to set the directory as a project. This particular one is from the <code>https_client</code> example in nRF Connect SDK.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>cmake_minimum_required</span><span>(</span>VERSION 3.8.2<span>)</span>

<span>find_package</span><span>(</span>Zephyr REQUIRED HINTS $ENV{ZEPHYR_BASE}<span>)</span>
<span>project</span><span>(</span>https_client<span>)</span>

<span>target_sources</span><span>(</span>app PRIVATE src/main.c<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In my case, I’ll show you how I used several <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> so the compiler knows about my device drivers!</p>

<h3 id="kconfig"><code>Kconfig</code></h3>

<p><code>Kconfig</code> allows you to create project-based configuration parameters. If you’ve ever used Nordic’s Original SDK, you know the pain of their <code>sdk_config.h</code> file. <em>It’s a nightmare.</em></p>

<p>Like <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>, <code>Kconfig</code> files allow you to keep the configuration as close to your code. There’s no massive top-level configuration manifest to be afraid of. You can add your code without breaking the repository. Good stuff, right?</p>

<p>Here’s an example of a <code>Kconfig</code> from the <code>ncs/nrf/applications/asset_tracker</code> application</p>

<div><div><pre><code>menu "Asset tracker"

rsource "src/ui/Kconfig"

config APPLICATION_WORKQUEUE_STACK_SIZE
    int "Application workqueue stack size"
    default 4096

config APPLICATION_WORKQUEUE_PRIORITY
    int "Application workqueue priority"
    default SYSTEM_WORKQUEUE_PRIORITY

menu "GPS"
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can see that it references separate <code>Kconfig</code> files as a dependency. You can also see that some environment variables are set with default values. You can either add them to your project’s <code>prj.conf</code> <em>or</em> edit them using <code>west build -t menuconfig</code>. If you’re looking to make permanent changes, you should use the <code>prj.conf</code> method.</p>

<p>The most important part about <code>Kconfig</code> files in regards to drivers is that you can use these variables as flags for conditional compilation.</p>

<p>As an example, here’s what the <code>ncs/nrf/drivers/sensor/CMakeLists.txt</code> looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>add_subdirectory_ifdef</span><span>(</span>CONFIG_BH1749 bh1749<span>)</span>
<span>add_subdirectory_ifdef</span><span>(</span>CONFIG_SENSOR_SIM sensor_sim<span>)</span>
<span>add_subdirectory_ifdef</span><span>(</span>CONFIG_PMW3360 pmw3360<span>)</span>
<span>add_subdirectory_ifdef</span><span>(</span>CONFIG_PAW3212 paw3212<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You may notice that all the variables begin with <code>CONFIG_</code>. All variables produced by <code>Kconfig</code> have this prefix. So, for example, <code>APPLICATION_WORKQUEUE_STACK_SIZE</code> becomes <code>CONFIG_APPLICATION_WORKQUEUE_STACK_SIZE.</code></p>

<p>In the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> above, you can see that a subdirectory is only added if the driver is “enabled”. <code>CONFIG_BH1749</code> happens to be the top-level environment variable to make that happen. You can also use this type of conditional compilation for your project code.</p>

<h3 id="zephyrmoduleyml"><code>zephyr/module.yml</code></h3>

<p><code>Kconfig</code> and <code>CMakeList.txt</code> are great, but where do we start? How does <code>west</code> know where to start looking for them?</p>

<p>The answer is a very unsuspecting file called <code>module.yml</code>. <code>module.yml</code> is usually found in the <code>/zephyr</code> subdirectory of a dependency. For example, here’s the one for nRF Connect SDK located in <code>ncs/nrf/zephyr/</code></p>

<p>Example</p>

<div><div><pre><code>build:
  cmake: .
  kconfig: Kconfig.nrf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The file tells <code>west</code> where to find the appropriate base <code>Kconfig</code> and <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>. Those are the starting point for further repository traversal. Without these, there’s no way to use your driver code in your application!</p>

<h2 id="adding-a-drivers-folder">Adding a drivers folder</h2>

<p>You now should understand <code>Kconfig</code>, <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>, and <code>module.yml</code>. We’re ready for driver development!</p>

<p>In my case, since my driver work is ongoing, I opted to use my own <code>drivers</code> folder in my main project repository. You can always opt to start developing your drivers in <code>zephyr/drivers</code>. This is likely a better location especially if you want to release the driver for others to use. The downside is that it requires more work!</p>

<p>In my case, here’s …</p></div></div>

    <p>Society moves in waves.  It always starts with lots of separate things. Then they get bundled. After a while, more and more people start to realize that the bundled solution is too bloated and not specific enough for their needs. <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/5/21/office-messaging-and-verbs">This is when an unbundling happens.</a></p>

<p>Unbundlings always represent a multitude of business opportunities. Below I’ll list several examples of unbundlings that have happened in the past, some that are happening right now, and a few speculations on what might be unbundled next.</p>

<p>While going through the following examples, ask yourself:  What aspect hasn’t been unbundled yet? What could be unbundled in a better way?</p>

<p>A few suggestions:</p>

  <li>Twitter? (Especially its DM function, e.g., along the lines of what Earn.com tried. But also the “News-Feed” aspect, the “Life-Updates” aspect, the RSS-Feed aspect, etc.)</li>
  <li>Ebay? Amazon? (See Etsy, Shopify)</li>
  <li>Offices? (See Slack, Zoom, <a href="https://www.focusmate.com/">Focusmate</a>, <a href="https://wip.chat/">WIP.chat</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d love to hear on <a href="https://twitter.com/jakobgreenfeld">Twitter</a> what unbundlings you’ve observed in the past and which you predict for the future!</p>

It consolidates a lot of the legal paperwork, fees, and hassle of incorporating a business, giving you access to a bevy of Stripe resources for company formation, all behind an online dashboard that sits inside your usual Stripe account. It costs $500 and covers a few hundred dollars in legal fees, plus it comes with thousands of dollars in credits with affiliated partners.</p>
<p><strong>Stripe Atlas offers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proof your company is incorporated - papers, Tax ID, etc  </li>
<li>Stripe account  </li>
<li>Business checking account with Azlo Banking (optional, more on this later)  </li>
<li>Access to the Stripe Atlas community  </li>
<li>A year of registered agent fees (required for Delaware Corps, normally $100/year)</li>
<li>Off-the-shelf legal templates created by Stripe Atlas-affiliated lawyers</li>
<li>Special offers from vendors ($5,000 in AWS credits, $10,000 in Digital Ocean, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Although Stripe Atlas was designed initially for businesses that wanted to incorporate as Delaware C Corporations, it’s been expanded to support LLCs - meaning that if you don’t want to issue stock, have a Board of Directors, etc, but just want the legal framework for some shared profit venture, with the liability protection of an LLC, Stripe Atlas is still for you.</p>
<p>A major feature of Atlas, finally, is that it optionally comes with a business bank account. Access to the US banking system is a killer feature for international entrepreneurs who might want to process payments, sell / purchase companies, or otherwise participate in the American market.</p>
<p><strong>So, Stripe Atlas is for</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entrepreneurs who want to simplify the incorporation process  </li>
<li>Startup Founders  </li>
<li>Bootstrappers / Indiehackers / Side Project-ers  </li>
<li>International Entrepreneurs who want to do business in the US</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-we-chose-stripe-atlas">Why <em>We</em> Chose Stripe Atlas</h2>
<p>We’re a <a href="https://formcake.com/about">small, four-person bootstrapped business</a> (basically, bullet points one and three). We knew and trusted Stripe as our payment processor and loved the idea of not only consolidating a lengthy, involved process into a tool we (already!) used, we also saw the $500 fee as more than worth it, considering the promised $5,000 in AWS credits, registered agent fees, and incorporation fee. The ability to create a business bank account in addition to the incorporation was gravy, considering that we needed a business-only Stripe-connected account. For us, since all we required was a garden-variety, digitally-oriented LLC formation with the ultimate company divided into four ownership units, Atlas made perfect sense. If our needs hadn’t been so simple and we’d ultimately needed something more custom, we still would’ve explored Stripe Atlas’ premade templates and flat-fee legal services, but more cautiously.</p>
<h2 id="approval-process">Approval Process</h2>
<p>In order to get approved for a Stripe Atlas account and a Delaware C Corporation, you’ll need to provide some information to Stripe for <em>each person</em> who’s going to be a part owner of the company:</p>
<p><strong>What you’ll need</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photo of your driver’s license</li>
<li>Driver’s license number</li>
<li>Driver’s license expiration</li>
<li>Physical address</li>
<li>Social security number</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you submit this info Stripe will hit you with a whole mess of emails asking you to Docusign everything from an IP Assignment, which assigns any intellectual property you might have created to the company, to the actual paperwork dividing stock if you’re a Delaware C Corp or ownership units if you’re an LLC. It’s all very direct and automated, signing each stage of documents and providing the requisite information unlocks the next stage of documents and info-gathering.</p>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong>: We signed up and submitted all our personal info<br><strong>Day 3</strong>: A mistake! We noticed in our Stripe Atlas dashboard that the status of our documents was no longer "Submitted." We notified them, resubmitted some things, and they rectified the error.<br><strong>Day 6</strong>: We receive the company formation documents: IP assignment, ownership percentages, etc.<br><strong>Day 10</strong>: We received our bank account with Azlo but still couldn’t accept payment (trying to process one would trigger an error through the Stripe API)<br><strong>Day 14</strong>: We receive our EIN (Employer Identification Number), otherwise known as our tax ID. We can now accept payments!</p>
<h2 id="stripe-atlas-aws-credits">Stripe Atlas AWS Credits</h2>
<p>Stripe Atlas teases a number of partner benefits in their promotional copy - $5,000 for AWS, up to $100,000 for GCP (!). Of course our all-AWS infrastructure makes those AWS credits essentially free money, so we were very interested in maximizing that benefit.</p>
<p>So after signing up for Atlas and going through all the AWS rigamarole we were able to secure only $1,000 in AWS credits.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/stripe-atlas-includes-five-thousand-credits-this-is-what-we-got">posted about it</a> and actually received a follow up from Stripe:</p>
<section>
Hi David, 

<p>Thanks for your interest in Stripe Atlas. My name is Tony and I’ll be happy to share further about our tools.</p>
<p>We know that building a new business is exciting and challenging—but it can also be costly. To help you get off to a great start, Stripe Atlas has partnered with Amazon Web Services to create some great offers for Stripe Atlas businesses.</p>
<p>In your case, applying through Stripe Atlas, the amount you're eligible for is (up to) $5000. The "up to" phrase is because there is a lifetime eligibility cap.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions about AWS benefits or Stripe Atlas, just reply to this email—we're happy to help.       </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Tony</p>
</section>

<p>In summary: It seems that though Stripe can advertise the "up to" amounts it’s the actual partners (like AWS) who are setting the standards for what companies merit what credit payouts. Basically, Stripe directs you to AWS, you verify you’re a Stripe customer via a code, and the Amazon Gods pay what they pay.</p>
<p>It seems in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/activate/">AWS Activate</a> (the program giving the credits) we signed up under the "Bootstrapped / Self-funded" option to get our $1,000 in credits. Maybe if we'd signed up as a "Funded" startup we could've expected the full $5,000?</p>
<p>It’s disappointing and a little opaque, but no more than most marketing copy. Just keep in mind as you’re reading those credit totals in the official Stripe Atlas documentation that they come with light asterisks - it’s not ultimately Stripe awarding those amounts.</p>
<h2 id="stripe-atlas-taxes">Stripe Atlas Taxes</h2>
<p>We have been incorporated for under a fiscal year, so alas we haven’t had the pleasure of doing taxes yet. We have done some research into it though, and tried to get a sense of what support Stripe offers Atlas companies during tax time.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of some of the Stripe communication around taxes. These resources all came in an email to Atlas founders:</p>
<section>

- <a href="https://discuss.stripe.community/t/should-i-pay-taxes-again/13738">“I paid taxes four months ago. I just got an email saying I have to pay again.”</a>
</section>

<h2 id="azlo-banking-option">Azlo Banking Option</h2>
<p>We decided to create a business checking account with Azlo because we desperately needed to move off my-real-live-checking-account we naturally shipped with.</p>
<p>We haven’t done anything exciting from a financial perspective - no complicated M&amp;A’s, accounting logistics, or large business loans - we’ve just been depositing money from our Stripe account and occasionally withdrawing.</p>
<p>One neat feature of using Azlo + Atlas is that when you’re activating your Stripe account, moving beyond the testing stage and generating a live production token, as soon as Stripe gives you a valid token you’re ready to accept payments - immediately. It’s a great feeling adding that critical Stripe token to your secrets management, pushing it live, and knowing someone can “walk up”, purchase your digital product, and pay you money for it, all completely automated. This is admittedly a small thing but also indicative of some of that Stripe attention to detail they’re so great about.</p>
<h2 id="our-conclusion">Our Conclusion</h2>
<p>Really the only blemish on our entire Stripe Atlas experience was wanting that sweet $5,000 in AWS credits but settling for $1,000 - which feels like a pretty small, spoiled gripe. Having the central location for everything company incorporation-related in our Stripe dashboard - where we’re already comfortable - and small things like document and personal info checklists, only having to pay a single entity (Stripe) instead of a million small fees, along with just having the whole thing on rails, makes Atlas a great proposition.</p>

    </section>
    <section>
      <p><i>For the Q2 2020 Yelp Economic Average report, we’re using a new methodology that tracks several indicators on a daily basis, and extends into Q3. For more on the methodology for this report, <a href="https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/yea-q2-2020.html#methodology">click here</a>.</i></p>
    
      
        <p>As cities reopen and COVID-19 cases continue to rise across the country, local governments have taken action, pivoting their reopening plans. Many businesses that eagerly reopened doors in June were forced to scale back operations and in some cases even shut down again — a costly action for many small businesses.</p>
        <p>Yelp’s latest <a href="https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/yelp-coronavirus-economic-impact-report.html" target="_blank">Local Economic Impact Report</a>, published in June, showed a decrease of business closures compared to April and an increase in consumers getting back to their normal activities – such as dining in at restaurants, heading back into shopping malls and planning weddings. We’re now beginning to uncover longer term trends including a correlation between interest in restaurants, bars and nightlife, and gyms to a spike in COVID-19 cases across hotspot states. The report also measures business closure data that reflects an unstable economy; slower, but still consistent changes in consumers getting back to pre-pandemic activities; and sustained interest in supporting Black-owned businesses.</p>

      <h2>Increased Consumer Activity in May Correlates with Increased COVID-19 Cases in June</h2>
        <p>In <a href="https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/yea-q1-2020.html" target="_blank">mid-to-late March</a> we saw consumer activity drop swiftly and uniformly across the nation. This new status quo was maintained in most states through at least mid-to-late April. In May, some states maintained the shutdown level of consumer interest, but many started to revert towards the pre-pandemic norm.</p>

          <p>As people began resuming common pre-pandemic activities across states like Florida, Nevada, South Carolina, Texas, Georgia and others – specifically, frequenting restaurants, bars and nightlife, and gyms – a clear spike in COVID-19 cases within those locations quickly followed.</p>

    <section>
        <p>As outbreaks worsened through late June, consumer interest in these categories started to come back down in states like Florida, Texas, South Carolina, and Arizona. This emphasizes the strong correlation between the pandemic and consumer behavior. When there's a major outbreak, Yelp data suggests it negatively impacts consumer interest in businesses where social distancing may be harder to enforce. If COVID-19 cases remain flat or decrease in a state, consumer behavior and local policies tend to revert towards the pre-pandemic norm, leaving the state vulnerable to a major outbreak in the near future. These outbreaks may then require stricter measures to suppress cases, as we are currently seeing in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/states-reopening-coronavirus-map/" target="_blank">California and Florida</a>.</p>

      <h2>Business Closures Fluctuate Across the Nation</h2>
        <p>The curve in business closures that we once saw <a href="https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/yelp-coronavirus-economic-impact-report.html" target="_blank">going down</a> has continued to change over the last month. We last reported 140,000 total businesses closures on Yelp from March 1 to June 15. We saw this increase to more than 147,000 total business closures on June 29 and then drop again to just more than 132,500 total business closures as of July 10. This rapidly changing number of closures reflects rapidly evolving situations at the local level, as some states with rising cases start to close again, while others continue to reopen. In April, we reported more than 175,000 business closures indicating that only 24% of businesses that were closed in April have reopened.</p>

      <!--<h2>Hed</h2>-->
        <p>Even as total closures fall, permanent closures increase with 72,842 businesses permanently closed, out of the 132,580 total closed businesses, an increase of 15,742 permanent closures since June 15. This also means that the percentage of permanent to temporary business closures is rising, with permanent closures now accounting for 55% of all closed businesses since March 1, an increase of 14% from June when we reported 41% of closures as permanent. Overall, permanent closures have steadily increased since the peak of the pandemic with minor spikes in March, followed by May and June.</p>

        <p>On a metro level, Las Vegas, NV, is suffering from the highest rate of permanently closed businesses with 861 businesses permanently closed, as the city reacts to a <a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2020/jun/30/closed-casinos-yielded-near-zero-nevada-tax-revenu/" target="_blank">decrease in tourism</a>.

      <h2>Permanent Closures Continue to Increase Across Restaurants, Retail and Other Industries</h2>
        <p>While some industries have been able to slowly bounce back with fewer temporary closures, many are still enduring an increasing number of permanently closed businesses.</p>
        <p>The restaurant industry now reflects the highest total business closures, recently surpassing retail. As of July 10, there have been 26,160 total restaurant closures, an increase of 2,179 since June 15. Of the all closed restaurants in July, 15,770 have permanently closed (60%), accounting for 2,956 more permanent closures, a 23% increase since June 15. Meanwhile, bars and nightlife, an industry 6X smaller than restaurants, have endured an especially high closure rate, with 5,454 total business closures, 2,429 (44%) of which are permanent closures.</p>
        <p>Many retail businesses shifted their operating models and started offering curbside pickup and online ordering, unfortunately those measures aren’t always enough to sustain their business long term. Shopping and retail businesses have endured 26,119 total business closures, of which 12,454 are permanent, representing 48% of closed retail businesses on Yelp. On June 15, we reported 27,663 closed retail and shopping businesses, of which only 9,640 were permanently closed. Since then we’ve seen 1,544 retail businesses reopen, however an even higher number have been forced to shut their doors permanently, accounting for 2,814 new permanent closures, a 29% increase in permanent retail closures in the last month.</p>
        <p>The beauty industry follows a similar trend as the retail industry with 13,609 total business closures, a decrease from 15,348 in June, as many businesses have been able to reopen their brick and mortar locations. However, the industry has suffered from 1,213 new permanent closures since June 15, totalling 4,897 permanent closures as of July 10.</p>
        <p>Similar to retail and beauty, though there are fewer temporarily closed businesses, the fitness industry has also suffered from an increase in permanent closures. As of July 10, there have been 4,907 total fitness closures, a decrease of 682 closed businesses since June 15. However, of all closed fitness businesses 1,930 are permanently closed, representing 39% of closed fitness businesses on Yelp – 504 more permanent closures than in June. While some fitness businesses have been able to continue operating through virtual classes, many smaller brick and mortar studios have been forced to shut their doors permanently, as these small businesses battle affording high rent and operating expenses without being able to use their physical space.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Resilience in Action is a podcast about all things resilience, from SRE to software engineering, to how it affects our personal lives, and more. Resilience in Action is hosted by Blameless Staff SRE Amy Tobey. Amy has been an SRE and DevOps practitioner since before those names existed. She cares <em>deeply</em> about her community of SREs and wants to take what she’s learned over the 20+ years of her career to help others.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In our fourth episode, Amy chats with Craig Sebenik, SRE at Aurora and co-author of “<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/what-is-sre/9781492054429/#:~:text=Book%20Description,sites%20continuously%20introduce%20new%20features.">What is SRE</a>?” and “<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/salt-essentials/9781491914427/">Salt Essentials</a>.” He has a degree from Le Cordon Bleu (Sydney, Australia), a Master's in Italian Cuisine (Apcius in Florene, Italy), and a Master's in Gastronomy (University of Rheims, France). His greatest passion is teaching what he has learned from adventures in SRE and cooking.<br></p><p>See the full transcript of their conversation below, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity.<br></p><p><strong>Amy Tobey: In lieu of introductions, I thought we should just jump straight into our first experiences on the internet.</strong><br></p><p><strong>Craig Sebenik: </strong>My first introduction to the web specifically (not the internet) was in graduate school at Brown in 1991. I had been using Gopher for a number of years and I loved Gopher. It was fantastic, but obviously pictures were kind of a pain in Gopher. Maps and things like that were not generally accessible but textual information was really easy to find because of its hierarchical nature.</p><p>One of the graduate students I was working with pointed me at this "brand new" thing called the world wide web. It was Mosaic back in the early days, and this was on an educational network.<br></p><p><strong>Amy Tobey: </strong>What kind of machine was it?<br></p><p><strong>Craig Sebenik: </strong>I was doing computational chemistry so they were all SGIs, even in those days with 19-20” monitors.</p><p>It was fantastic. I was used to Gopher and its hierarchical nature. Moving to the web was very, very different. And I said, "You know what? I'm looking for an email address for a friend of mine that I met at an internship a couple years before." The graduate student said, "Okay, what's the URL?" I'm like, "The what?". She said, "I need to know where to start."&nbsp;</p><p>In Gopher, you start at the root, you go to education or, in this case, New York and then you go down the chain looking for the right school. At this point, there were no search engines, and you had to know where to start. Looking back at the time, I&nbsp; was hopeful, but I had to say, "This thing sucks." I was not a fan of the web in the early days.<br></p><p><strong>Amy Tobey: </strong>Those of us that didn't really experience Gopher never knew that past. I came in late for Gopher. I hit Usenet early and then I basically skipped over Gopher entirely. Almost everybody I've talked to who experienced their formative time on Gopher tends to go, "Yeah this web stuff just kind of sucks by comparison."<br></p><p><strong>Craig Sebenik: </strong>Then WebCrawler and AltaVista came out. I'm like, "Oh, yeah. This makes it better." And then the big one hit—not the big one that most people today would think of—and that was Yahoo.</p><p>These college kids published essentially all their bookmarks (and this was back when Yahoo was something like cs.standford.edu/yahoo or something like that.) It was like, "This is fantastic." Much like Gopher, it was organized hierarchically.<br></p><p><strong>Amy Tobey: </strong>You were in school at this time for computational chemistry, so how the heck did you get from there to index technology?<br></p><p><strong>Craig Sebenik: </strong>I was always programming. I was programming on SGIs and then I transferred to University of Michigan and I graduated/dropped out. Whatever. It's all nuance. But I got my Masters from Michigan and I was, "Now I need a job. What do I know how to do?" At that point I didn't know a lot except how to program. The first job I got was actually a backup person. I would go in on Sundays and change the tapes.</p><p>That was a part time gig for three to four months. Then in ‘94, I found a mom-and-pop ISP located in Plymouth, Michigan. It's next to me down from Ann Arbor. There were maybe 20 employees and we were doing web design/ISP. We had a bank of modems that people would dial into.<br></p><p><strong>Amy Tobey: </strong>I kind of miss that entry point. That's a very different environment to cut your teeth in, compared to what a lot of corporations are like today. The friends of mine that did it described a shop where you could just basically—if you were getting stuff done—do whatever the heck you wanted. <strong>Can you talk a little bit about that environment and kind of how it molded how you approach reliability?</strong><br></p><p><strong>Craig Sebenik: </strong>One of the big differences in those days was security. Security was not as big of a deal as it is today. You just did the little bit of security that you needed to, and because there were fewer tools, it was more on individuals to write their own little bash scripts. This would have been before things like ADUser were as common as they are today.</p><p>So you had to write your own ADUser script that would update the password file, create the home directory, and change permissions on the home directory from a skeleton. It's so funny seeing what exists today. I wrote something exactly like that. Granted it was nowhere near as resilient as they are today. The number of edge cases that a general purpose tool has to deal with is significantly more than your specific scenario where you get a list of names from the sales person. They’d say, "We just signed this account. You need to add these 20 accounts to the main servers." You created a bash script with the current list of 20. You copied that script to all four servers, and you ran the script. You watched it and it was fine. The idea of centralized logging didn't exist, and the idea of metrics didn't exist in the same way.<br></p><blockquote>The number of edge cases that a general purpose tool has to deal with is significantly more than your specific scenario where you get a list of names from the sales person.</blockquote><p><strong>Amy Tobey:</strong> I mean we didn't even SSH really. There was SAR and rlogin.<br></p><p><strong>Craig Sebenik: </strong>We did do a little bit of SSH at the time but mostly it was Telnet.<br></p><p><strong>Amy Tobey: </strong>So we're at the late end of the 90s. That's where I started my career. I was a music major. I wasn't making enough progress on my university parts because as a music major usually you get sucked into all of the ensembles, which are usually a credit or two but they usually want four to six hours a week of your time. I was way behind. And then toward the end I thought, "Oh crap. I've got to start making money at some point." ThenI had some realizations about myself and whether I was really suited to teach in high school or middle school. I did half a semester of CS.</p><p>I had learned a bunch of Linux over the summer, so I thought, "Oh, I'll try this CS thing. This is exciting," and was eternally bored. I found a job in Detroit doing systems administration for a stock broker. That was my entry point. But at the time I was still presenting as a white male. I feel like that was a big part of how I got that opportunity. <strong>When I look back at it, I keep trying to find those details in the story that I can share with other people for how they can get their start in the industry because systems administration in our experience has been a great place to enter. Do you have any memories of that early time when you were first building your career of things that you did or that you found that really helped you accelerate into where you are today?</strong><br></p><p><strong>Craig Sebenik: </strong>At the time most of my educational experience was, as I mentioned, on SGI and Sun (specifically SunOS 4 and then eventually Solaris). The biggest thing was probably just digging around the file system. If your listeners don't know, SunOS 4 was essentially a BSD version, whereas Solaris was System 5. The file layouts are pretty different, especially in those days. This is obviously well before Upstart, or systemd, or anything like that. So just looking at how the boot process works.<br></p><p><strong>Amy Tobey:</strong> Nobody does that anymore.<br></p><p><strong>Craig Sebenik: </strong>Not really. They assume that systemd will do the right things for them. You can argue that the problems have just moved up from a single host and how it boots up to how a distributed application eventually comes up with all its downstream dependencies being available. Things have moved up from a typical OS up to the service level.<br></p><p><strong>Amy Tobey: </strong>At the service level, we're starting at an incredible level of complexity right out of the gate, whereas when you and I started, we were writing init scripts by hand and learning shell along the way. This afforded us the opportunity to have that learning environment where we could make mistakes at a relatively low level of complexity compared to, "Well let's deploy your first service into Kubernetes." There's a billion more lines of code between there and where we were.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>Craig Sebenik: </strong>Interestingly one of the things that has changed since then is that the opportunity to experiment is much richer now. You can go create some instances on the free tier in AWS or Google of Azure or whatever and play with whatever you want. In those days, trying to find a BSD variant that I could completely screw up and not really piss somebody off was almost unheard of. Fortunately I really cut most of my teeth in academics where it didn't matter quite so much.</p><blockquote>Interestingly one of the things that has changed since then is that the opportunity to experiment is much richer now.

It's not like I'm screwing up the whole chemistry department.<br></p><p><strong>Amy Tobey: </strong>I saw a link earlier this morning about among all the job losses that have been happening as part of the COVID-19 …</p></div></div>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In my self study of Rust, I’ve run into concepts that are different than anything else I’ve seen in other languages, and have had a hard time wrapping my head around. The purpose and usage of <code>Cell</code> and <code>RefCell</code> is one of those concepts. I said to myself, “why not write a blog, it’ll help you, and maybe help someone else!”. Putting my thoughts and inquiries in writing has been helpful for me, and I hope it’s just as helpful for you!</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>To understand what these things are, we need to understand <em>Interior Mutability</em> and how it relates to “normal” Rust.</p>

<p>What’s interior mutability? Interior mutability is different than the <em>Inherited Mutability</em> that we are so used to (even if we didn’t know the technical term). Variables in Rust exhibit inherited mutability when they are defined using the <code>mut</code> keyword; this is the standard way of declaring a mutable variable. The following code is what you don’t want, producing the error below it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x is {}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Error!</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  |
2 |     let x = 1;
  |         -
  |         |
  |         first assignment to `x`
  |         help: make this binding mutable: `mut x`
3 |     x += 1;
  |     ^^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Change <code>let x = 1</code> to <code>let mut x = 1</code>, and we solve the problem! The program correctly prints</p>



<p>Ok cool, that’s easy. Now what do we do when we want to update a variable in a function, but don’t want to pass ownership? We just use a mutable reference!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>add_and_print</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>*</span><span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x in add_and_print is {}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
    <span>// mutable reference to x is dropped</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// Declare a mutable variable x</span>
    <span>add_and_print</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span> <span>// Modify x in function</span>
    <span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// Modify x again</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x in main is {}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which prints</p>

<div><div><pre><code>The value of x in add_and_print is 2.
The value of x in main is 3.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which is expected. Cool, we can update mutable references in functions and still update them where owned. In the example above, the reference <code>&amp;mut x</code> has inherited mutability as <code>mut</code> is being passed down directly from the current scope (as we’ll see, in contrast to interior mutability).</p>

<p>Ok, now here’s a contrived example, but represents the use case of <code>Cell</code> and <code>RefCell</code>. Let’s say we have this struct.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>XStruct</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ok, so it’s a struct that holds a mutable reference to an i32, so ownership of <code>x</code> doesn’t change, and the following compiles.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[derive(Debug)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>XStruct</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>x_struct</span> <span>=</span> <span>XStruct</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>x</span> <span>};</span>

    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x_struct is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x_struct</span><span>);</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and we get…</p>

<div><div><pre><code>The value of x_struct is XStruct { x: 1 }.
The value of x is 1.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Nice, still compiles and prints the expected result! Now let’s try an mutate <code>x</code> in <code>main</code>!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[derive(Debug)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>XStruct</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// Declare a mutable variable x</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>x_struct</span> <span>=</span> <span>XStruct</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>x</span> <span>};</span> <span>// Pass a mutable reference to x</span>

    <span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// Modify x...</span>

    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x_struct is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x_struct</span><span>);</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and the compiler says…</p>

<div><div><pre><code>   |
8  |     let x_struct = XStruct { x: &amp;mut x };
   |                                 ------ borrow of `x` occurs here
9  |
10 |     x += 1;
   |     ^^^^^^ use of borrowed `x`
11 |
12 |     println!("The value of x_struct is {:?}.", x_struct);
   |                                                -------- borrow later used here
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ughhhhhhh, we can’t do this. We’ve made a mutable borrow when defining <code>x_struct</code>, and it hasn’t gone out of scope yet. The compiler WILL NOT let us do this. To understand why we can’t do this, let’s review Rust’s borrow rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You can have one mutable reference.
OR (exclusive)</li>
  <li>You can have multiple immutable references.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, our issue in the above example is that we have two references to <code>x</code>, and we want those references to be mutable. (Yeah I know, <code>x</code> in <code>main</code> isn’t borrowed, <code>x</code> owns it’s value, but I’d still think it be able to mutate it’s own data).</p>

<p>You may be asking, why do we have these rules in the first place? The reason is to prevent data races, which can result in nondeterministic errors, which are just awful to deal with (I won’t go deeper into data races as it’s a whole other topic in computer science and programming).</p>

<p>Ok, we have these rules, BUT I WANT MULTIPLE MUTABLE REFERENCES. That’s where interior mutability comes to the rescue!</p>

<p>The gist of interior mutability is that we can wrap something that’s <em>mutable</em> in a structure that is <em>immutable</em>. We can then create multiple immutable references to that thing (which follows rule #2 above), get a mutable reference when we’re ready, and then mutate the value! (We’ll discuss the caveats later. No free lunch, right?)</p>

<h3 id="refcellt-yay"><code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, YAY!</h3>

<p>So, think of <code>RefCell</code> as the tortilla of the interior mutability burrito… (ok I’ll stop). Here’s an example of our failed borrow example using <code>RefCell</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cell</span><span>::</span><span>RefCell</span><span>;</span>

<span>#[derive(Debug)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>XStruct</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>RefCell</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>add_and_print</span><span>(</span><span>x_struct</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>XStruct</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>*</span><span>x_struct</span><span>.x</span><span>.borrow_mut</span><span>()</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// Mutably borrow and dereference the underlying data</span>

    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x_struct in add_and_print is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x_struct</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>ref_cell_x</span> <span>=</span> <span>RefCell</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span> <span>// ref_cell_x is immutable</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>x_struct</span> <span>=</span> <span>XStruct</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>ref_cell_x</span> <span>};</span> <span>// Pass an immutable reference to ref_cell_x</span>

    <span>add_and_print</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>x_struct</span><span>);</span> <span>// Pass an immutable reference to x_struct</span>

    <span>*</span><span>ref_cell_x</span><span>.borrow_mut</span><span>()</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// Modify ref_cell_x</span>

    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Final value of x_struct is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x_struct</span><span>);</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Final value of x is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>ref_cell_x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>IT COMPILES!!!! The output we get is…</p>

<div><div><pre><code>The value of x_struct in add_and_print is XStruct { x: RefCell { value: 2 } }.
Final value of x_struct is XStruct { x: RefCell { value: 3 } }.
Final value of x is RefCell { value: 3 }.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>…which is exactly what we expected! The value in <code>ref_cell_x</code> first starts as 1, we call <code>add_and_print</code> which increases the value inside to 2, then we add 1 again to the value in <code>ref_cell_x</code> and get a final value of 3, and both <code>ref_cell_x</code> and <code>x_struct</code> both have the same value. We did this all without creating a mutable reference to <code>ref_cell_x</code>!</p>

<h3 id="but-what-about-cellt">But what about <code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code>?</h3>

<p><code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code> is just a different way to accomplish interior mutability. With <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, you get a reference to the underlying data (note the <code>Ref</code> part). With <code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code>, you indirectly interact with the wrapped value by using <code>set</code> and <code>get</code> (and some other fancy methods). Here’s the same example from above rewritten using <code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cell</span><span>::</span><span>Cell</span><span>;</span>

<span>#[derive(Debug)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>XStruct</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>Cell</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>add_and_print</span><span>(</span><span>x_struct</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>XStruct</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>x_struct</span><span>.x</span><span>.get</span><span>();</span>
    <span>x_struct</span><span>.x</span><span>.set</span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>

    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x_struct in add_and_print is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x_struct</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>cell_x</span> <span>=</span> <span>Cell</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>x_struct</span> <span>=</span> <span>XStruct</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>cell_x</span> <span>};</span>

    <span>add_and_print</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>x_struct</span><span>);</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>cell_x</span><span>.get</span><span>();</span>
    <span>cell_x</span><span>.set</span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>

    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Final value of x_struct is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x_struct</span><span>);</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Final value of x is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>cell_x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and the output is…</p>

<div><div><pre><code>The value of x_struct in add_and_print is XStruct { x: Cell { value: 2 } }.
Final value of x_struct is XStruct { x: Cell { value: 3 } }.
Final value of x is Cell { value: 3 }.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See? Same result. As you can tell, the only difference is that we first had to <code>get</code> the value out of the cell, modify it, and then <code>set</code> it again.</p>

<h3 id="when-should-i-use-refcellt-vs-cellt">When should I use <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> vs. <code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code>?</h3>

<p>There are two main differences between <code>RefCell</code> and <code>Cell</code>. First, types wrapped in <code>Cell</code> must implement the <code>Copy</code> trait while those in <code>RefCell</code> don’t need to. This makes sense. When calling <code>get</code> on a <code>Cell</code>, you are getting a copy of the wrapped data, whereas the methods associated with <code>RefCell</code> are <code>borrow</code> and <code>borrow_mut</code>, which return references to the underlying data. Copying data back and forth does come at a performance cost, especially if the wrapped data is big, therefore making <code>RefCell</code> an attractive candidate.</p>

<p>The second difference is that <code>RefCell</code>’s references are checked at runtime, which comes at a performance cost of verifying reference counts and possibly being completely wrong about your borrowing logic and causing your program to panic (not good); you can’t cause panics using <code>set</code> and <code>get</code> with <code>Cell</code> as you’re not modifying the data through reference. Here’s an example of what can go wrong with <code>RefCell</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cell</span><span>::{</span><span>RefCell</span><span>};</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>cell</span> <span>=</span> <span>RefCell</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>cell_ref_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>cell</span><span>.borrow_mut</span><span>();</span> <span>// Mutably borrow the underlying data</span>
    <span>*</span><span>cell_ref_1</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"RefCell value: {:?}"</span><span>,</span> <span>cell_ref_1</span><span>);</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>cell_ref_2</span> <span>=</span> <span>cell</span><span>.borrow_mut</span><span>();</span> <span>// Mutably borrow the data again (cell_ref_1 is still in scope though...)</span>
    <span>*</span><span>cell_ref_2</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"RefCell value: {:?}"</span><span>,</span> <span>cell_ref_2</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This program compiles, but panics halfway through running.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>thread 'main' panicked at 'already borrowed: BorrowMutError'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What? Isn’t the compiler supposed to prevent these types of reference errors? Yes, for “normal” mutable references. The reference rules stated earlier still apply, they’re just enforced at runtime when using <code>RefCell</code>.</p>

<p>And this is the double edged sword of <code>RefCell</code>s. There are times where we need more flexibility than just a singular mutable reference. <code>RefCell</code> gives us this flexibility, but at the cost of not checking our references statically.</p>

<p>I hope this explanation of interior mutability, <code>Cell</code>, and <code>RefCell</code> was helpful to you! Feel free to contact me if you any comments, suggestions, or just need to correct me!</p>

              <p>
                As a small startup, when it comes to process (the word itself induces unpleasant flashbacks to sitting in tons of unproductive meetings at big companies) we try to follow the “if it’s not broken, then don’t fix it” mindset. 
              </p>
              <p>
                For a long time, since it was just Eric and I working together, we got by with almost no documentation other than a heap of disorganized Dropbox Paper documents, tons of calls at odd hours (often lasting until 2am), and a bunch of texts and/or Slack messages.
              </p>
              <p>
                This stopped working when two things happened: 1) we began working with our first contractor and 2) we began onboarding a lot more new customers. Things got a lot busier and resources became more scarce (there are only so many hours in the day!), and because we were so disorganized it was hard to keep focused on our actual goals instead of just dealing with whatever fires came up. Soon it became evident that <i>our lack</i> of process was holding us back. 
              </p>
              <p>
                To solve this, we followed the 80/20 rule to figure out how we could implement a minimal amount of process to help us reap a majority of the benefits. After trying a few things that haven’t worked, these are the 4 tools we’ve landed on that help us plan and execute against our goals each week: 
              </p>
              <ol>
                  <li><a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a>, for weekly priority tracking</li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.cadencework.com/">Cadence</a>, for status and progress updates</li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.linear.app/">Linear</a>, for task tracking</li>
                  <li>Only two scheduled 15 minute meetings to begin and end the week</li>
                </ol>
              
              
              <p>
                At Cadence, we run weekly sprints. We kick off each week with a short 15-minute meeting. This meeting is important because it is where we decide and align on what our top 3 weekly priorities are.
              </p>
              <p>
                We then record those weekly priorities in Notion and assign each priority an owner. For that week, the owner’s top goal is to achieve their priority, meaning they should prioritize and scope their tasks however they want so that they can do so.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is what our weekly priority table in Notion looks like:
              </p>
              <figure>
                <img src="https://www.cadencework.com/assets/img/notion-priorities.png" alt="Notion">
              </figure>
              <p>
                Afterwards, we break each of our priorities into discrete engineering tasks and add them to Linear. (I will probably make a future post detailing how we track tasks and manage cycles in Linear, but that’s out of scope for now.) 
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout the week, we use Cadence to update each other on the progress of our tasks as we work on them. Not only does Cadence eliminate the need for daily status calls, it also helps us proactively identify blockers. With our Cadence updates, we can help each other debug problems either directly in a threaded discussion on Slack or a quick, synchronous call. 
              </p>
              <p>
                This is what our Cadence updates look like: 
              </p>

              </figure>
              <p>
                We even use Cadence to praise members of our team, which further helps us stay connected throughout the week. 😄
              </p>
              <figure>

              </figure>
              <p>
                Finally, at the end of the week, we hop back on a call to assess how we did on achieving our priorities for that week. We also catch up with each other and chat about any fun weekend plans we have coming up. 😄
              </p>

              <p>
                Ultimately, as is true for any company, the product development cycle is a constantly evolving one. In fact, I am sure I will re-read this post in a few months and barely recognize what I am talking about. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

<p>I was determined to screen out the overhead electrical wires, trash dumpsters, and road construction that detracted from the postcard images I was trying to achieve. He said those pictures were clichés. Everyone already knows what they look like because they’re on a million kitchen calendars and Hallmark cards. Why not capture what the landscape really looks like? America is mostly parking lots, squat concrete strip malls, storm water retention ponds, refineries, chain link fences, and tract homes made of plastic siding. Photographing the authentic American landscape is both more challenging and ultimately more rewarding if you can do it well.</p>

<p>I was in Missoula, Montana a while back attempting to capture the look and feel of the place when the director of a senior center walked up to me and demanded to know what I was doing. I said I was a tourist taking pictures. She didn’t believe me. <em>These aren’t tourist scenes.</em> She insisted I stop or she was going to call the police. I offered a vague apology, showed her my identification, and said I’d stay put until the authorities arrived.</p>

<p>I was walking around a nondescript neighborhood in Chicago a few years ago when five squad cars surrounded me at an intersection. I was asked for my identification, they were keen to see what was on my camera, and there were all sorts of questions about who I was and what I was up to. The police wouldn’t say exactly why they descended on me in such an overwhelming fashion, but it was pretty clear there had been a report of unsavory activity of the terrorist variety.</p>

<p>Last year I was in Atlanta wandering around as I tend to do. So much of this particular neighborhood had devolved into a state of disrepair that the buildings were uninhabitable. But to my surprise people were still living in some of the units. More shocking still, as I later learned, landlords continued collecting rent from tenants.</p>
<p>As I explored the area and gathered photos a woman called out to me from across the street. <em>Not for camera view!</em> She kept repeating the phrase over and over. <em>Not for camera view!</em> I approached her, introduced myself, and asked her why she objected to my activities. She shook her head and waved her hands adamantly. <em>Not for camera view!</em> That’s all she ever said to me. I suspect a middle aged white guy with an expensive camera was an indication that there were forces at work that threatened her housing situation – as precarious and substandard as it was. I tried to imagine where she might be forced to live if these buildings and her situation were ever disturbed.</p>

<p>Some time later I was in Thousand Oaks, a prosperous suburban enclave in Southern California, doing the same thing. A man came out of his home and marched across his lawn toward me full of piss and vinegar. He demanded to know who I was, but before I could answer he let me know exactly who he thought I was. <em>I was a thief casing the neighborhood!</em>&nbsp;I’m a lot of things, but threatening isn’t one of them. I handed him my drivers license and told him the truth. Documenting the American landscape is a peculiar hobby of mine.</p>
<p>He scoffed, but decided I wasn’t a thief. <em>He realized at that moment that I was a real estate developer looking to destroy his community!</em>&nbsp;Nope. Not even close. I said I was curious about how people live in different places, et cetera. He became squinty eyed. <em>I was a news reporter looking to stir up trouble!</em> Well, I have a blog, but so does everyone and their dog. It’s not like I’m with the New York Times or anything. <em>Aha! You’re from the government!</em> (Read: a dirty communist.) And so it went.</p>

<p>I was in Detroit doing my usual thing when a man across the street began yelling at me. <em>You have no right to photograph me without express written permission!</em> He came at me with righteous indignation. I handed him my card, told him I was visiting from San Francisco, and said I was curious about what Detroit was really like. <em>I will sue you if you publish any photos of me in them! How dare you violate my rights!</em> I scrolled though the images on my camera screen and showed him I wasn’t actually photographing him at all. His expression flickered for a split second before he redirected his tirade. <em>You have no right to invade our community. You think this place is yours to do with as you please, but it’s not. </em>The conversation went on like this for a while. I wanted to know who he thought I was and what he thought I was doing. I wanted to know about the specifics of his grievances. <em>Anything I tell you will only be used against me and my people.</em></p>
<p>So this is what America is actually like. The good, the bad, and the ugly. Look out your window. Take a drive down to your local big box store. Walk around your neighborhood. This is reality. Just sayin’.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This is a story of how a software company was able to start a conversation with 8x more of their users by cutting&nbsp;the length of their emails by 90%. You could set up a test of this method in less than an hour.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/c377678ef05df48ca100bc7c0c7b4ee18ae4292d/5f0ab/images/uploads/0356.jpg" alt="Cartoon About Saying Less"></p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p><strong>One of the most valuable things you could do for your software business is talk to your users.</strong> You can help them get more value from your software, learn how they use your product, hear their feedback, and demonstrate the quality and commitment of your support.</p>

<p>However, if you’ve ever tried to talk to your users by email, you probably ran into a problem:&nbsp;<strong>Many users&nbsp;don’t respond.</strong></p>

<p>Even if you follow all the best practices around emails, genuinely want to help them, and spend a long time writing a personalized email, people&nbsp;still don’t respond. That can be very frustrating.</p>

<p>Netlify—<a href="https://www.netlify.com/">a platform for static sites</a>—was feeling this frustration, so they brought me in to help.</p>

<p>Knowing that signups don’t matter if new users aren’t starting to use and get value from the software, Netlify was emailing every new user with an offer to help or answer any questions.</p>

<p>By most measures, the email was good: It was personalized, sent within&nbsp;a day, sent by a real person (their head of customer success), and had&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/dont-design-emails/">no flashy design</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Unfortunately it had a reply rate of just 1%.</strong> They were missing a huge opportunity by&nbsp;failing to reach 99 of every 100 users.</p>

<h2>The Solution: Saying Less</h2>
<p>When I saw the length of the original email, I suspected users are:</p>

<ul>
 	<li>Not&nbsp;bothering to read it because of its length.</li>
 	<li>Assuming it's a template email because of its length, and therefore don't believe the offer to help is sincere.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first thing I&nbsp;did was delete most of the email text&nbsp;and run an A/B test against the original…</p>

<h3>First A/B Test:&nbsp;Original vs Short Email</h3>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7fe4ca1e7b73c29c841ee396bc6a727fcf546bbd/4f5e5/images/uploads/onboarding-email-1.jpg" alt="Long Onboarding Email"></p>

<p>This original email had 150+ words and a reply rate of 1% (1 of every 100 users).</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a0b1c850a8b4f90c586af96347a02cce4516fe5d/2c0d2/images/uploads/onboarding-email-2.jpg" alt="Short Onboarding Email"></p>

<p>This variation&nbsp;had 37 words&nbsp;and resulted in a reply&nbsp;rate&nbsp;of 4% (1 of every 25 users).</p>

<p><strong>Cutting the original email text by 75% increased the reply rate by 300%.</strong></p>

<p>That’s a terrific&nbsp;result for a few minutes of work. I&nbsp;could have stopped there, but wondered how far I&nbsp;could take this before seeing diminishing returns.</p>

<p>On to the second test…</p>

<h3>Second A/B Test: Short vs Very Short</h3>

<p>I&nbsp;took the winning email from the first test and cut another 50% of the text, taking out as much as possible while retaining the email’s meaning, then tested it against the previous winner.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/277ca277bbecd4e9282c4bd579557b6029cae3f1/513f3/images/uploads/onboarding-email-3.jpg" alt="Very Short Onboarding Email"></p>

<p>This version has just 14 words. It resulted in a reply rate of 8% (1 of every 12 users).</p>

<p><strong>Cutting the email text by another 50% <em>doubled</em> the&nbsp;reply rates from the previous version.</strong> Compared to the original, the length was cut by 90% and reply rates increased by 700%.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/164e960178dbe5fd0019901e2da78a68bcb38406/55ff3/images/uploads/reply-rates.png" alt="Email Reply Rates"></p>

<p><strong>Imagine you could onboard 8x more people to your software&nbsp;and hear 8x more feedback from new users.</strong> That’s the power of saying less.</p>

<h2>Try It Yourself</h2>

<p>Take your welcome&nbsp;or onboarding&nbsp;email—<a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/question-for-saas-trial-users/">start here</a> if you don’t have one—and cut out any text that isn’t&nbsp;necessary. When you feel you’re done, take out another 50%. Finally,&nbsp;run an A/B test and measure positive replies to this shorter email versus your original.</p>

      <p>If you want to get anything done, there are two basic ways to&nbsp;get yourself to do it.</p>
<p>The first, more popular and devastatingly wrong option is to try to motivate yourself.</p>
<p>The second, somewhat unpopular and entirely correct choice&nbsp;is to cultivate discipline.</p>
<p>This is one of these situations where adopting a different perspective immediately results in superior outcomes. Few uses of the term “paradigm shift” are actually legitimate, but this one is. It’s a lightbulb moment.</p>
<p>What’s the difference?</p>

<p><strong>Motivation, broadly speaking, operates on the erroneous assumption that a particular mental or emotional&nbsp;state is necessary to complete a task.</strong></p>
<p>That’s completely the wrong way around.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline, by contrast, separates outwards functioning from moods and feelings <em>and thereby ironically circumvents the problem by consistently improving them</em>.</strong></p>
<p>The implications are huge.</p>
<p><strong>Successful completion of tasks brings about the inner states that chronic procrastinators think they need to initiate tasks in the first place.</strong></p>
<p>Put in simpler form, <strong>you don’t wait until you’re in olympic form to start training. You train to get into olympic form.</strong></p>
<p>If action is conditional on feelings, waiting for the right mood becomes a particularly insidious form of procrastination. I know that too well, and wish somebody pointed it out for me twenty, fifteen or ten years ago before I learned the difference the hard way.</p>
<p>If you wait until you feel like doing stuff, you’re fucked. That’s precisely how the dreaded procrastinatory loops come about.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2014/08/Screen_Shot_2014_08_26_at_3.40.03_PM/e467ccab2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/08/the-procrastination-loop-and-how-to-break-it/379142/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source of picture&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>At its core, chasing motivation is insistence on the infantile fantasy that we should only be doing&nbsp;things we<em> feel like</em> doing. The problem is then framed thus: “How do I get myself to <em>feel like doing</em> what I have rationally decided to do?”. Bad.</p>
<p>The proper question is “How do I make my feelings inconsequential and do the things I consciously want to do without being a little bitch about it?”.</p>
<p>The point is to cut the link between feelings and actions, and do it anyway. You get to feel good and buzzed and energetic and eager <em>afterwards</em>.</p>
<p>Motivation has this the wrong way around. I am utterly 100% convinced that this faulty frame is the main driver of the “sitting about in underwear playing Xbox, and with yourself” epidemic currently sweeping developed countries.</p>
<p>There are psychological problems with relying on motivation as well.</p>
<p>Because real life in the real world occasionally requires people do things that nobody in their right mind can be massively enthusiastic about, “motivation” runs into the insurmountable obstacle of trying to elicit enthusiasm for things that objectively do not merit it. The only solution besides slackery, then, is to put people out of their right minds. That’s a horrible, and fortunately fallacious, dilemma.</p>
<p>Trying to drum up enthusiasm for fundamentally dull and soul crushing activities is literally a form of deliberate psychological self-harm, a voluntary insanity: “I AM SO PASSIONATE ABOUT THESE SPREADSHEETS, I CAN’T WAIT TO FILL OUT THE EQUATION FOR FUTURE VALUE OF ANNUITY, I LOVE MY JOB SOOO MUCH!”</p>
<p>I do not consider self-inflicted episodes of hypomania the optimal driver of human activity. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysthymia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thymic</a> compensation via depressive episodes is inevitable, since&nbsp;the human brain will not tolerate abuse indefinitely. There are stops and safety valves. There are hormonal hangovers.</p>
<p>The worst thing that can happen is succeeding at the wrong thing – temporarily. A far superior scenario is retaining sanity, which unfortunately tends to be misinterpreted as moral failure: <em>“I still don’t love my pointless paper-shuffling job, I must be doing something wrong.”</em> <em>“I still prefer cake to brocolli and can’t lose weight, maybe I’m just weak”.</em> <em>“I should buy another book about motivation”</em>. Bullshit. The critical error is even approaching those issues in terms of motivation or lack thereof. The answer&nbsp;is discipline, not motivation.</p>
<p>There is another, practical problem with motivation. It has a tiny shelf life, and needs constant refreshing.</p>
<p>Motivation is like manually winding up a crank to deliver a burst of force. At best, it stores and converts energy to a particular purpose. There are situations where it is the correct attitude, one-offs where getting psyched and spring-loading a metric fuckton of mental energy upfront is the best course of action. Olympic races and prison breaks come to mind. But it is a horrible basis for regular day-to-day functioning, and anything like consistent long-term results.</p>
<p>By contrast, discipline is like an engine that, once kickstarted, actually <em>supplies</em> energy to the system.</p>
<p>Productivity has no requisite mental states. For consistent, long-term results, discipline trumps motivation, runs circles around it, bangs its mom and eats its lunch.</p>
<p>In summary, motivation is trying to feel like doing stuff. Discipline is doing it even if you don’t feel like it.</p>
<p>You get to feel good <em>afterwards</em>.</p>
<p>Discipline, in short, is a system, whereas motivation is analogous to goals. There is a symmetry. Discipline is more or less self-perpetuating and constant, whereas motivation is a bursty kind of thing.</p>
<p>How do you cultivate discipline? By building habits – starting as small as you can manage, even microscopic, and gathering momentum, reinvesting it in progressively bigger changes to your routine, and building a&nbsp;positive feedback loop.</p>
<p>Motivation is a counterproductive attitude to productivity. What counts is discipline.</p>

<h2> Haskell Language Server, binaries and installation </h2>
<p>
    Posted on July 24, 2020 by <a href="https://github.com/bubba">Luke Lau</a>
    <span><img src="https://mpickering.github.io/ide/images/bubba.png"></span>
</p>

<p>If you’ve ever had to install <em>haskell-ide-engine</em> or <em>haskell-language-server</em>, you might be aware that it is quite a lengthy process. There are several reasons for this, two of the most significant being:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both <em>haskell-ide-engine</em> and <em>haskell-language-server</em> act as a kitchen sink for plugins. These plugins all depend on the corresponding tool from Hackage, and as a result they end up pulling in <strong>a lot</strong> of transient dependencies.</li>
<li>The GHC API that powers the underlying <em>ghcide</em> session only works on projects that match <strong>the same</strong> GHC version as it was compiled with. This means that in order to support multiple GHC versions (which is quite common with Stack projects that can define a specific version of GHC) the install script needs to build a binary of <em>haskell-ide-engine</em>/<em>haskell-language-server</em> <strong>for every single GHC version</strong> that is supported.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter is the purpose of the <em>hie-wrapper</em>/<em>haskell-language-server-wrapper</em> executable. The <code>install.hs</code> script will install binaries for every version under <code>haskell-language-server-8.6.5</code>, <code>haskell-language-server-8.8.3</code>, etc. The wrapper is then used in place of the language server, and will detect what version of GHC the project is using and launch the appropriate version of <em>hie</em>/<em>haskell-language-server</em>.</p>
<p>Building all these different binaries with several different versions of GHC means you need to build every single dependency multiple times over, leading to some hefty build times and chewing through a lot of disk space. On top of this, installation from source is the <em>only</em> supported installation method so far. This isn’t great for newcomers or for those who just want to setup a working IDE in a pinch. So many of us have spent the past month hard at work trying to improve the installation story.</p>

<p>One obvious solution would be to just provide static binaries. This has been a <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine/issues/1068">long running discussion</a>, that dates all the way back to <em>haskell-ide-engine</em>. When we say static binaries, we mean a binary that has no dynamically linked libraries. You can test that by running <code>ldd</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ ldd haskell-language-server-wrapper
    linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fff185de000)
    libz.so.1 =&gt; /usr/lib/libz.so.1 (0x00007faa3a937000)
    libtinfo.so.5 =&gt; /usr/lib/libtinfo.so.5 (0x00007faa3a8d2000)
    librt.so.1 =&gt; /usr/lib/librt.so.1 (0x00007faa3a8c7000)
    libutil.so.1 =&gt; /usr/lib/libutil.so.1 (0x00007faa3a8c2000)
    libdl.so.2 =&gt; /usr/lib/libdl.so.2 (0x00007faa3a8bc000)
    libpthread.so.0 =&gt; /usr/lib/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007faa3a89a000)
    libgmp.so.10 =&gt; /usr/lib/libgmp.so.10 (0x00007faa3a7f7000)
    libm.so.6 =&gt; /usr/lib/libm.so.6 (0x00007faa3a6b2000)
    libc.so.6 =&gt; /usr/lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007faa3a4eb000)
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 =&gt; /usr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007faa3a9ab000)</code></pre>
<p>That’s a lot of linked libraries, all of which will need to be available on the users machine if we were just to ship the binary like that. With cabal-install, we can statically link these with just <code>cabal build --enable-exeutable-static</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ ldd haskell-language-server-Linux-8.10.1 
	not a dynamic executable</code></pre>
<p>However one big caveat is that this only works on Linux. macOS doesn’t really have a notion of truly static binaries, since the system libraries are only provided as dylibs. The best we can do is just ensure that the only dynamically linked libraries are the ones already provided by the system, which it looks like it was in the first place!</p>
<pre><code>$ otool -L haskell-language-server
haskell-language-server:
	/usr/lib/libncurses.5.4.dylib (compatibility version 5.4.0, current version 5.4.0)
	/usr/lib/libiconv.2.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current version 7.0.0)
	/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1281.100.1)
	/usr/lib/libcharset.1.dylib (compatibility version 2.0.0, current version 2.0.0)</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, making a static binary is one thing, but having that binary be portable is another. If we want the binary to run on other machines outside of the host, it can’t rely on data-files, which some <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine/issues/1143">plugins such as <em>hlint</em> used</a>. And the same goes for any <code>libexec</code> binaries, which <em>cabal-helper</em> took advantage of.</p>
<p>Once these were <a href="https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint/pull/824">taken care of upstream</a>, we then had to deal with GHC library directory: This is a directory that comes with your GHC installation, typically in something like <code>/usr/local/lib/ghc-8.10.1/</code> or in <code>~/.stack/programs/x86_64-osx/ghc-8.10.1/lib/ghc-8.10.1/</code> for Stack. Inside it contains all the compiled <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Library_submissions#The_Libraries">core libraries</a>, as well as the actual ghc executable itself: Your <code>/usr/bin/ghc</code> is most likely a script that just launches the binary in the library directory!</p>

<p>Either way, <em>ghcide</em>/<em>haskell-language-server</em> use the GHC API, which <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-8.10.1/docs/GHC.html#v:runGhc">needs to know where this directory is</a> to do it’s job:</p>

<p>The most common way to get the path to the library directory is through the <a href="https://github.com/simonmar/ghc-paths/blob/master/Setup.hs"><em>ghc-paths</em></a> package, which uses <a href="https://github.com/simonmar/ghc-paths/blob/master/Setup.hs">some custom <code>Setup.hs</code> magic</a> to work out where the library directory is, for the GHC <strong>that is being used to compile the program</strong>. It bakes in the paths at compile time, which means it’s portable if we share the source and build it on other systems. But if we build it on one system where the library directory is at <code>/usr/local/lib/ghc-8.10.1</code> for example, then when <strong>distributing the binary</strong> to another system it will still try looking for the old path which resides on a completely different machine! For example, if GHC was installed via ghcup on the other system, then the library directory would reside at <code>~/.ghcup/ghc/8.10.1/lib/</code>: a very different location.</p>
<p>So if we want to be able to distribute these binaries and have them actually run on other systems, <em>ghc-paths</em> is out of the question. This means that we have to somehow get the library directory oureslves <strong>at runtime</strong>. Thankfully, the <code>ghc</code> executable has a handy command for this:</p>
<pre><code>$ ghc --print-libdir
/usr/local/lib/ghc-8.10.1</code></pre>
<p>We could just call this directly. But what if you had a Cabal project, configured with <code>cabal configure -wghc-8.8.3</code> whilst the <code>ghc</code> on your PATH was version 8.10.1? Then the library directories would have mismatching verisons! What we can do instead however is:</p>
<pre><code>$ cabal exec ghc -- --print-libdir
Resolving dependencies...
/usr/local/lib/ghc-8.8.3</code></pre>
<p>And consider even the case for Stack, where it downloads GHC for you. Well, we can do the same thing as Cabal:</p>
<pre><code>$ stack exec ghc -- --print-libdir
/Users/luke/.stack/programs/x86_64-osx/ghc-8.6.5/lib/ghc-8.6.5</code></pre>
<p>These commands are tool specific, so it only made perfect sense to put this logic into <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hie-bios"><em>hie-bios</em></a>, our library for interfacing and setting up GHC sessions with various tools. Now there’s an API for cradles to specify how to execute the <code>ghc</code> executable that they use when building themselves.</p>

<p>The build process is automated across a wide range of platforms and GHC versions on GitHub Actions, which gets triggered everytime a release is made. Previously setting up Haskell on Travis CI/CircleCI/AppVeyor used to be pretty fiddly, but the <a href="https://github.com/actions/setup-haskell">setup-haskell</a> action for GitHub has made dramatic strides recently. In just a few lines of yaml we can setup a rather hefty build matrix for all the verisons we support:</p>
<pre><code>  build:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        ghc: ['8.10.1', '8.8.3', '8.8.2', '8.6.5', '8.6.4']
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macOS-latest, windows-latest]
        exclude:
          - os: windows-latest
            ghc: '8.8.3' # fails due to segfault
          - os: windows-latest
            ghc: '8.8.2' # fails due to error with Cabal</code></pre>
<p>
<img alt="Now that's what I call a build matrix" src="https://mpickering.github.io/ide/images/github-actions-matrix.png" height="300">
</p>
<p>Unfortunately the story of Haskell on Windows is a bit hairy as usual, so there were a few bumps that needed worked around. The biggest and most annoying one by far was hitting the <code>MAX_PATH</code> limit for file paths whenever we tried to build the <code>haskell-language-server-wrapper</code> executable. Admittedly this is a rather long name for a binary, but a combination of the fact that GitHub actions checks out the source directory in <code>D:\a\haskell-language-server\haskell-language-server</code> and how Cabal’s per-component builds nest build products crazy deep meant that we we’re constantly going over the rather stringent 260 character limit:</p>
<pre><code>Linking D:\a\haskell-language-server\haskell-language-server\dist-newstyle\build\x86_64-windows\ghc-8.10.1\haskell-language-server-0.1.0.0\x\haskell-language-server-wrapper\build\haskell-language-server-wrapper\haskell-language-server-wrapper.exe ...
55
realgcc.exe: error: D:\a\haskell-language-server\haskell-language-server\dist-newstyle\build\x86_64-windows\ghc-8.10.1\haskell-language-server-0.1.0.0\x\haskell-language-server-wrapper\build\haskell-language-server-wrapper\haskell-language-server-wrapper-tmp\Paths_haskell_language_server.o: No such file or directory
56
`gcc.exe' failed in phase `Linker'. (Exit code: 1)</code></pre>
<p>We tried several things including</p>
<ul>
<li>Enabling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#enable-long-paths-in-windows-10-version-1607-and-later">LongPathsEnabled registry key</a> to disable this restriction. But it turns out it was already on the entire time and <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/13373">GHC/GCC aren’t using the right Windows API calls</a></li>
<li>Checking out the code in a different root directory, but it doesn’t seem to be possible with GitHub actions</li>
<li>Squashing the build directory with just <code>--build-dir=b</code> – still left us 2 characters over the limit!</li>
<li>Disabling per-component builds – just fails with another build error</li>
</ul>
<p>But at the end of the day, the only reliable solution was just to rename <code>haskell-language-server-wrapper</code> to something shorter whilst building:</p>
<pre><code>- name: Shorten binary names
  shell: bash
  run: |
    sed -i.bak -e 's/haskell-language-server/hls/g' \
               -e 's/haskell_language_server/hls/g' \
               haskell-language-server.cabal
    sed -i.bak -e 's/Paths_haskell_language_server/Paths_hls/g' \
               src/**/*.hs exe/*.hs</code></pre>
<p>There’s still some sporadic issues with <a href="https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/6986">Cabal on Windows</a> and GitHub Actions having infrastructure outages so the builds aren’t 100% flake free yet, but it does provide a rather large build …</p></div></div></div>

<h2><strong>What is DevOps?</strong></h2>



<p>The DevOps methodology, a software and team management approach defined by the portmanteau of Development and Operations, was first coined in 2009 and has since become a buzzword concept in the IT field. </p>



<p>DevOps has come to mean many things to each individual who uses the term as DevOps is not a singularly defined standard, software, or process but more of a culture. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/devops" target="_blank">Gartner</a> defines DevOps as:</p>



<p><em>“DevOps represents a change in IT culture, focusing on rapid IT service delivery through the adoption of agile, lean practices in the context of a system-oriented approach. DevOps emphasizes people (and culture), and seeks to improve collaboration between operations and development teams. DevOps implementations utilize technology—especially automation tools that can leverage an increasingly programmable and dynamic infrastructure from a life cycle perspective.”</em></p>



<p>As you can see from the above definition, DevOps is a multi-faceted approach to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), but its main underlying strength is how it leverages technology and software to streamline this process. So with the right approach to DevOps, notably adopting its philosophies of co-operation and implementing the right tools, your business can increase deployment frequency by a factor of 30 and lead times by a factor of 8000 over traditional methods, according to a CapGemini <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/de-de/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/03/devops-the-future-of-application-lifecycle-automation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survey</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>The Right Tools for the Job</strong></h2>



<p>This list is designed to be as comprehensive as possible. The article comprises both very well established tools for those who are new to the DevOps methodology and those tools that are more recent releases to the market—either way there is bound to be a tool on here that can be an asset for you and your business. For those who already live and breathe DevOps, we hope you find something that will assist you in your growing enterprise.</p>



<p>With such a litany of tools to choose from, there is no “right” answer to what tools you should adopt. No single tool will cover all your needs, and will be deployed across a variety of development and Operational teams, so let’s break down what you need to consider before choosing what tool might work for you.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Plan and collaborate:</strong> Before you even begin the SDLC, your business needs to have a cohesive idea of what tools they’ll need to implement across your teams. There are even DevOps tools that can assist you with this first crucial step.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Build:</strong> Here you want tools that create identically provisioned environments. The last you need is to hear “But it works for me on my computer”</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Automation:</strong> This has quickly become a given in DevOps, but automation will always drastically increase production over manual methods.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Continuous Integration:</strong> Tools need to provide constant and immediate feedback, several times a day but not all integrations are implemented equally, will the tool you select be right for the job?</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Deployments need to be kept predictable, smooth and reliable with minimal risks, automation will also play a big part in this process.</li></ul>



<p>With all that in mind, I hope this selection of tools will aid you as your business continues to expand into the DevOps lifestyle.</p>

<h2>3. <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/" target="_blank">Google Cloud Deployment Manager</a></strong></h2>



<p>Much like the tools mentioned above, Google Cloud Deployment Manager is Google’s IAC tool for the Google Cloud Platform. This tool utilizes YAML for its config files, and JINJA2 or PYTHON for its templates. Some of its notable features are synchronistic deployment and ‘preview’, allowing you an overhead view of changes before they are committed.</p>

<p>Terraform is brought to you by HashiCorp, the makers of Vault and Nomad. Terraform is vastly different from the above mentioned tools in that it is not restricted to a specific cloud environment, this comes with increased benefits for tackling complex distributed applications without being tied to a single platform.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Few have seen these happy little landscapes in person, and they're in Penticton all summer.</p><div><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="" sizes="" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5660021.1595516348!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/bob-ross.jpeg"></p></div><figcaption>Bob Ross does his happy little thing. Scene from The Joy of Painting.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Bob Ross, Inc.)</figcaption></figure><p><span><p>When a shipment of paintings from Bob Ross, Inc. arrived at the <a href="http://pentictonartgallery.com/bob-ross-exhibition">Penticton Art Gallery</a>, Paul Crawford realized he was looking at mountains and meadows and "happy little trees" that few, if any, had seen in decades.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"It was crazy opening them up," says Crawford, the curator at the PAG. "I don't think they'd seen the light of day since they were put in the boxes. They still smelled of turpentine."</p>  <p>To September 13, Penticton&nbsp;— a city of 33,000 in the Okanagan Valley&nbsp;—&nbsp;will be one of the only places in the world where you can find an authentic Bob Ross. And the solo exhibition, <em>Happy Little Accidents</em>, is the largest of its kind to happen anywhere to date. Still, with more than 30 Bob Ross originals on view, the selection is nothing — a mere drop in the babbling brook — when you consider the volume Ross produced on <em>The Joy of Painting</em> alone.&nbsp;</p>  <h2>'Let's get crazy'</h2>  <p>Between 1983-94, the series taped 403 episodes out of a local PBS station in Muncie, Ind. And beyond the occasional guest appearance — from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QWvzEQ69Kw">Bob's son Steve</a> or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpNrn0_97LM">Peapod the Squirrel</a> — the program's lulling, low-budget formula never really wavered.&nbsp;</p>  <p>In half an hour, Ross would conjure an original painting, pictures he actually created in triplicate for each episode. One painting was a reference image;&nbsp;another was for publication (instructional books were a pillar of the original Bob Ross empire, a business that was reportedly worth <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/22/arts/television-bob-ross-the-frugal-gourmet-of-painting.html?pagewanted=all">$15 million US</a> by 1991). And the third piece materialized as the cameras rolled.&nbsp;</p>  <p>It's those canvases — familiar landscapes of nowhere in particular — that countless viewers have admired from home. But beyond the screen, these original works have rarely, if ever, been on view. Though Ross was known to occasionally donate his work to PBS stations, he didn't sell the paintings made on the program, and Bob Ross, Inc. — the company that manages his intellectual property — has never been in the business of dealing art. Originals are not for sale through BRI. Instead, you can buy Bob Ross jigsaw puzzles, novelty socks, even Fun Dip-style powdered candy (the Bob Ross "<a href="https://experience.bobross.com/2019/11/14/bob-ross-candy-flavor-palette/">Flavor Palette</a>"). On rare occasions, <a href="https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/entertainment/art/4684705-Minnesota-couple-learns-painting-bought-40-years-ago-is-Bob-Ross-original">an authentic landscape</a> will appear on the market.

Used with permission. )</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>If you want to see an actual painting, traditionally&nbsp;there's only been one reliable option. A&nbsp;collection can be found in New Smyrna Beach, Fla., home to the <a href="https://www.bobrossartworkshop.com/">Bob Ross Art Workshop and Gallery</a> since 1992. But the motherlode's stored at BRI headquarters. Last year, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/arts/bob-ross-paintings-mystery.html"><em>New York Times</em></a> journeyed to their office in Herndon, Va., and made a charming, bite-sized documentary that solved the mystery of the missing landscapes. (Some 1,165 Bob Ross originals are stashed away in their building.)</p>  <p>Crawford saw that doc last summer. And then he sent BRI an email. He wanted those paintings in Penticton.&nbsp;</p>  <h2>Making <em>Happy Little Accidents</em></h2>  <p>"I was really wanting to celebrate the legacy of Bob Ross, and really look at some of the larger questions that Bob presented himself: whose work deserves to be in a museum, and whose work needs to be remembered?" says Crawford.&nbsp;</p>  <p>A few years back, an exhibition devoted to the landscapes of <a href="https://mackenzie.art/experience/exhibition/a-sublime-vernacular-the-landscape-paintings-of-levine-flexhaug/">Levine Flexhaug</a>&nbsp;— Saskatchewan's master of the thrift-store sublime&nbsp;—&nbsp;appeared at galleries around the country. (A companion exhibition about Canadian "<a href="http://pentictonartgallery.com/speed">speed painters</a>," Flexhaug included, is open at the PAG to Sept. 13.) Crawford says he's taken a note from that travelling Flexhaug show in curating <em>Happy Little Accidents</em>, and if there's a strict definition of "museum-worthy," the show aims to "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy6J4e1z4Lc">beat the devil out of it</a>," like some old dirty paintbrush.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Ross died of lymphoma in 1995, but if a museum retrospective eluded him in his time, he wasn't especially fussed about it. In 1991, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/22/arts/television-bob-ross-the-frugal-gourmet-of-painting.html?pagewanted=all"><em>New York Times</em></a> asked Ross about the subject. Already a low-key icon, he said he wasn't keen on the notion. "Most painters want recognition, especially by their peers. I achieved that a long time ago with TV. I don't need any more." And according to BRI, major arts institutions weren't exactly clamouring to get their white gloves on a Bob Ross painting — at least until last year.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659999.1595507752!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/bob-ross-mountain-summit-1987.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659999.1595507752!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/bob-ross-mountain-summit-1987.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659999.1595507752!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/bob-ross-mountain-summit-1987.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659999.1595507752!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/bob-ross-mountain-summit-1987.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659999.1595507752!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/bob-ross-mountain-summit-1987.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659999.1595507752!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/bob-ross-mountain-summit-1987.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Bob Ross. Mountain Summit, 1987. The Joy of Painting, Season 13, Episode 10.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Bob Ross name and images are registered trademarks of Bob Ross Inc. © Bob Ross Inc. Used with permission. )</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>The DePaul Art Museum in Chicago was the first gallery to make contact, says BRI; in April 2019, four paintings appeared there in the exhibition&nbsp;<em><a href="https://resources.depaul.edu/art-museum/exhibitions/Pages/new-age-new-age.aspx">New Age, New Age: Strategies for Survival</a></em>. Later that year, the <a href="https://www.franklinparkartscenter.org/exhibitions/bob-ross/">Franklin Park Arts Centre</a> (Purcellville, Va.) opened <em>Happy Accidents</em>, a show devoted to Ross's TV paintings. When the PAG came calling, BRI says they were fielding similar requests from galleries around the world. Three paintings are now on view at <a href="https://arkdes.se/en/utstallning/asmr-weird-sensation-feels-good/">ArkDes</a> in Sweden (they're part of a salute to ASMR, the oddly satisfying genre of which Ross is hailed as the permed patron saint). Another solo exhibition is scheduled to open at the <a href="https://www.museummore.nl/en/">Museum MORE</a> in the Netherlands this November. And a <a href="https://minnetrista.net/home/things-to-do/exhibits/bob-ross-experience/">brand new attraction</a>, a shrine to the man himself, will open this October in Muncie, Ind., long-time home of <em>The Joy of Painting</em>.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Writes Sarah Strohl, an executive assistant at BRI: "With the recent resurgence of interest and love for Bob Ross in the past few years, we have displayed paintings in exhibits as well as donated four paintings to the Smithsonian." (Oh, yeah — that happened in 2019, too. In addition to the artwork, Smithsonian National Museum of American History&nbsp;acquired an old easel from the show and some production notebooks.) "However," says Strohl, "our focus has always been the same as Bob's on the show:&nbsp;to interest others in creating paintings of their own."</p>  <p>On the surface, yes,<em> The Joy of Painting</em>&nbsp;is designed so folks can dabble along from home. But it's a rare fan who's squeezed out a tube of Prussian Blue. Ross knew it. As he told the <em><a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1990-07-07-9007060122-story.html">Orlando Sentinel</a> </em>in 1990: "The majority of our audience does not paint, has no desire to paint, will never paint." Instead, the show's appeal is more abstract. It's less about the art lesson, and more about the mood: cozy, nurturing — an audio-visual pat on the back, coaxing the audience to try something new. For 22 minutes, at least, there's no fear of failure. As Ross used to say, "We don't make mistakes, we just have happy accidents."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="" sizes="" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5660007.1595508155!/fileImage/httpImage/bob-ross-happy-accidents.gif"></p></div><figcaption> <!-- -->(Giphy)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>But a Bob Ross fan doesn't necessarily get the same huggy vibes when they think about contemporary art. In curating <em>Happy Little Accidents</em>, Crawford says he was thinking about Ross's gift for reaching the masses. "So many people feel they don't have the knowledge that they can engage in art, and that, to me, is appalling. We need to change that."</p>  <p>Even in a pandemic, <em>Happy Little Accidents</em> has likely attracted some first-time patrons to the PAG already. The gallery is keeping extended hours to match demand, and is open seven days a week through the summer. According to Crawford, people have been lining up every morning since the show opened July 4. (Because of COVID-19, only 13 guests are allowed in the exhibition at a time.) Additional programming includes painting classes with a "Bob Ross-Certified" teacher. The first round sold out, and more have been added.&nbsp;(There are <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/bob-ross-instructors_n_56465ea4e4b0603773491281?ri18n=true&amp;guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAALON9mL8cT4UC27WdyOWykz8B3iZD94swx7lOm_2zN8aaDgGTklIkFGkyUq5GdWqW8ySYOua-68Wre2bQoYSgvuk0UsZ8yPi13cGZZGZZd6WGas1i9B2WMxtwnuorJ9x9fc42RCRIQrCCesQe5d9roE3ideznBF3IhlaETlpVsb">thousands of these official instructors around the world</a>, it turns out. Says Crawford: "There must be a dozen that are living within a three-hour drive of us here in Penticton.")&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5660001.1595507860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/happy-little-accidents.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5660001.1595507860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/happy-little-accidents.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5660001.1595507860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/happy-little-accidents.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5660001.1595507860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/happy-little-accidents.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5660001.1595507860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/happy-little-accidents.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5660001.1595507860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/happy-little-accidents.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>Installation view of Happy Little Accidents at the Penticton Art Gallery.

("It's a very solemn painting with a sort of dead tree that sort of sits in a very ethereal sort of landscape," says Crawford.) In person, he says the landscapes are more impressive than he'd imagined. "There's a luminosity to them, you know, for as beguilingly simple as they are."</p>  <p>And in researching the exhibition, Crawford says he came across a surprising B.C. connection&nbsp;—&nbsp;one that's only touched on at the museum. Before Ross made his TV debut, he studied with William Alexander, another guy known for painting landscapes on PBS. A former German POW, Alexander moved to North America after the Second World War, and lived all over Canada during his lifetime, including Powell River, B.C. His Emmy-winning series, though, <em>The Magic of Oil Painting</em>, taped at a Los Angeles public-broadcasting station from 1974-82, and it shares plenty of aesthetic DNA with Ross's format, right down to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExmWbC2I_Qg">all-black set</a>. "It's remarkable how similar they are," says Crawford. "But he was a rough, gruff-spoken fellow and didn't quite have Bob's smooth way of delivery." Alexander wasn't cool with Ross's fame, though. (As he told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/22/arts/television-bob-ross-the-frugal-gourmet-of-painting.html?pagewanted=all"><em>New York Times</em></a> in 1991: "I trained him and he is copying me.")

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In the book Winning, the legendary General Electric CEO Jack Welch defines his rules of leadership:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule 3: Leaders get into everyone’s skin, exuding positive energy and optimism…your job as a leader is to fight the gravitational pull of negativism. That doesn’t mean you sugarcoat the challenges your team faces. It means you display an energizing, can-do attitude about overcoming them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn’t agree more. How many truly optimistic managers do you see on a day to day basis?  Not people that are so over-leveraged that fear pushes them to hope everything works out. Not people who ignore hard truths and escape into a good Spotify playlist.</p>

<p>Optimistic managers. Managers who see the world for what it is - a never-ending grind full of challenges, bad-breaks, luck, let-downs, inspirations, and everything in between - and approach it with a consistently positive energy and will to make things work.</p>

<p>The answer: not enough. Here are some ways you can uplevel your optimism.</p>

<p>To be optimistic, don’t:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Commiserate regularly with your reports. Commiseration is a little forfeit, every time. As a leader, you shouldn’t be signalling that the way to react to adversity is to lament. The film Saving Private Ryan calls this out beautifully: “Gripes only go up the chain of command, never down. Privates gripe to sergeants, sergeants gripe to captains, captains gripe to majors, majors gripe to colonels and colonels gripe to generals. Gripes always go up, never down.”</li>
  <li>Otherize other teams in the org. Or more bluntly: don’t talk shit about other teams. They might not be perfect, but neither are you. Otherizing only makes it harder to find the path forward.</li>
  <li>Pretend like everything is great. Again, optimism isn’t about pretending things are great. It’s a commitment to framing things as challenges to be solved, not problems to be lamented.</li>
</ul>

<p>To be optimistic, do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have a never-ending well of persistence. You might feel like Sisyphus pushing that boulder up the hill day in and day out. Optimistic people understand that most of one’s work life is pushing boulders up hills and have a good attitude about it.</li>
  <li>Get over things. If you can’t reset your opinion on people, problems, slights, and all other things to an absolute neutral, you’ll be saddled with a distracting and deteriorating buildup of resentment. Learn to get over things completely.</li>
  <li>Commit. If you’re second guessing yourself every step of the way you’ll never be able to sustain optimism. Set some timeframe for re-evaluation - maybe 6 months or a year - and then forget about anything that sounds like “maybe”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Optimism isn’t a feeling that puffs your lungs up with rejuvenating life and leads to transcendent moments of inspiration. It’s removing the friction that your ego and backbone want to instinctively introduce when faced with challenges. It’s a way to move forward.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BadChinaTake">@BadChinaTake</a> is actually just a vehicle for ethnographic research needed to complete my second PhD. Yes, you did sign the Institutional Review Board waiver.</p>



<p>The following four broad categories are useful for anyone who wishes to navigate the cesspit of public opinion on the English-speaking Internet. While there are of course interdisciplinary individuals whose takes transcend categories, if not the very bounds of reason and logic, nevertheless, the following is sufficient as a primer to acquaint oneself with the varieties of garbage available to any aspiring to become a fabled China Watcher.</p>



<p>If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please keep them to yourself! I am very, very busy knowing things about China!</p>



<p><strong>Mystic China Knowers (MCKs)</strong></p>



<p><em>Examples: More or less any cultural consultant, Martin Jacques (who is also a tankie, detailed below, and does not even speak Chinese</em>)<em>, and really most people besides actual specialists in Eastern philosophy who insert quotes from Confucius</em> <em>into their writing</em></p>



<p>Most MCKs are not ethnically Chinese, BUT, they often have been to China and/or other places in the exciting <em>Sinosphere</em>, maybe for even up to a few years or more, and speak some Mandarin! Most often, though, theirs is of the mellifluous “<em>waw hway shwah zhawng-win</em>” variety, which they are entirely unaware of because the bar for non-native/heritage speakers (especially white ones) who learn Chinese is not low, it is just fully on the ground. MCKs are big fans of <strong>“phrenology for words,”</strong> an obnoxious genre of take based on an extremely superficial reading of some random Mandarin phrase, which they think they can divine like tea leaves with their HSK 3 level skills of cross-culture communication. For instance, from a consultant in India:</p>

Both Indian and Chinese cultures don’t have a word to bid adieu. In Mandarin its zài jiàn (再见), while the Indians say phir milenge, both mean I will see you again. It is a Western concept to say goodbye, surmising you might never see the person again.

Language, whether consumed through stories, written characters or ways of doing business, emote the underlying rich fabric of cultural connectedness between India and China.&quot;" srcset="https://manicuredchinahand.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-15-at-11.22.14-pm.png?w=1024 1024w, https://manicuredchinahand.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-15-at-11.22.14-pm.png?w=150 150w, https://manicuredchinahand.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-15-at-11.22.14-pm.png?w=300 300w, https://manicuredchinahand.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-15-at-11.22.14-pm.png?w=768 768w, https://manicuredchinahand.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screen-shot-2020-07-15-at-11.22.14-pm.png 1092w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"></figure></div>



<p><em>The notion of “goodbye” was indeed unheard of until brought to the subcontinent by the East India Trading Company and later to Qing China by the Royal Navy during the First Opium War</em>.<em> Everyone was just always, like, together before that</em>.</p>



<hr>



<p>From the relatively few MCKs whose attention spans and Mandarin reading ability  allow them progress from singular words or phrases into the realm of entire books, we get the “<strong>I once read this Chinese thing</strong>” subtype. Their genesis begins with the subject’s consumption of one, or maybe even a few, venerable Chinese texts. These texts might be a classic (probably read in translation, which is normally fine, unless you’re constructing a Unified Theory of China on it, in which case you need to suck it up and learn Classical Chinese). It might also be something like, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-07-05/is-the-u-s-in-a-new-cold-war-china-has-already-declared-it">I dunno, the Three Body Problem</a>, because that was on sale at Barnes &amp; Noble.</p>



<p>Whatever the text, upon consumption it renders unto the MCK a bounteous insight regarding literally anything you can think of about China and the Chinese; usually, this is also whatever topic is easiest to get placed in an op-ed or decent blog. Through feats of exegesis and interpretation that would put St. Augustine or Maimonides to shame, the MCK extracts meaning that, coincidentally, will also be critical for you to know if you want even the slightest chance of your line of spandex infant lederhosen to take off in Peking this fall. Their fee is $4,998.00 per briefing.</p>



<p>While rarer in the Twitterverse, there are certainly Chinese people whose views fall under the MCK category. One might argue that the Communist Party of China’s continued harping emphasizing 5,000 years of Chinese history puts it in this territory on occasion as well. (Archaeologist Michael Storozum has a good piece on why that claim relies on some pretty… liberal interpretations of what exactly constitutes a reliable historical record <a href="https://radiichina.com/china-5000-years-history/">here in Radii</a>.)</p>



<p><strong>Death 2 CCP Squad (D2CS)</strong></p>



<p><em>Examples: Rob Spalding, Chris Balding, Steve Bannon &amp; Miles Kwok, presumably all members of Committee on the Present Danger: China, management and most reporters of the Epoch Times</em></p>



<p>D2CS is to China as Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz are to Iraq. They are <strong>the inverse of a Tankie</strong>, in way; China cannot do anything that is not a pernicious threat to the civilized world, freedom, love, beauty, and truth. The D2CS cheapen legitimate, pressing concerns about China on security, economic, and human rights fronts by instantly transforming any discussion thereof into a Manichaean battle of the Utterly Good United States et al. versus the People’s Republic of Evil and its ilk. Particularly noxious because of the influence many of them have in the US government at present (or <em>had,</em> before getting kicked out, in the cases of Spalding and Bannon.)</p>

<p>D2CS types are <strong>predominantly, but not exclusively, right-wing.</strong> Their backgrounds are diverse—some (like Miles Kwok a.k.a. Guo Wengui) were burned by Beijing and flipped their relatively mundane anger at losing everything they had in some power struggle into a self-righteous crusade; others (like Spalding) were spurned by some part of The Beltway establishment for being nincompoops and are convinced there is a conspiracy against all good patriots; and some are justifiably aggrieved Hong Kongers who have placed their hopes on the American right to deliver them, which, in all seriousness, really sucks to see. Then there’s the Epoch Times. Remember when their editorial board <a href="https://www.abc10.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/verify-unsolicited-paper-spreads-outlandish-covid-claims/103-9290495e-a501-44fa-b7df-0bb0e385328b">suggested</a> people afflicted with COVID-19 should consider denouncing Chinese Communist Ideology as a potential cure? Great crowd over there. Quality stuff.</p>



<p>The <strong>relatively small left-wing D2CS contingent</strong> seems to be primarily composed of Extremely Online pro-Taiwan independence advocates, the kind who make Tsai Ing-wen look like Chiang Ching-kuo. It’s not clear to me how many are even Taiwanese. Their wrath also stems from kernels of concern about the security and wellbeing of the place they genuinely have come to love, but frankly, it just gets cringey, and they seem to lack an understanding that their rhetoric is frequently appropriated by the right to advocate for hawkish policy that if anything may put <em>more </em>Taiwanese people in danger.</p>



<p><strong>Tankies</strong></p>



<p><em>Examples: Employees of </em>Grayzone<em> (especially editor <a href="https://twitter.com/BenjaminNorton?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Ben</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/BenjaminNorton">Norton)</a>, the <a href="https://twitter.com/qiaocollective">Qiao <s>Beehive</s> Collective</a>, and upwards of 90% of people with ☭ in their Twitter display name)</em></p>



<p>A classic type whose name is derived from the Soviet tanks that rolled through either Czechoslovakia in 1968, Hungary in 1956, or even the tanks at Tiananmen Square in 1989, depending on who you ask. The Tankie is an unapologetic Western apologist for authoritarian violence and repression regularly deployed by the CCP against dissidents and activists it deems a threat to Party rule. The tankie will probably tell you those dissident and activists were counterrevolutionaries anyway. Many appear to be literal teenagers, which is telling.</p>



<p>Through extremely ahistorical and elementary readings of a smorgasbord of left-wing texts, or at least the screenshots of said texts they see on Twitter, Tankies collate around an “<strong>Identity Politics for Stalinists,” </strong>a ludicrous worldview the functionally renders the very idea of imperial colonialism exclusively to the domain of white-majority countries (except the USSR, of course, which was not imperialist, and Hong Kong democracy protestors, who are, because one of the waved a Union Jack that one time) and by extension does not countenance the idea that China could ever engage in similar offenses. Interestingly, there are degrees of Tankie-ism, or in other words, there are some Tankies that are too Tankie even for other Tankies:</p>

Kim Jong-un is just misunderstood.  It’s all very charming.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Politically, they are much less powerful on the whole than the most prominent D2CS type, probably because they are too obnoxious to be around in real life, making organizing grassroots actions hard. Yet they are subtly pernicious in that their presence is extremely corrosive for the left writ large; if I’m a Ukrainian-American at my first New York DSA meeting, I’m going to get pretty pissed when someone gets up and tells me my <em>babusya’s</em> death was actually faked for CIA agitprop or whatever. Ditto re: any Hong Konger who might otherwise organize on the left (speaking of which, shout out to <a href="https://lausan.hk/">Lausan</a> , which everyone should read).</p>



<p>Indeed, the tell-tale sign of Tankie-ism is the belief that the CIA/other Western intelligence agencies are several orders of magnitude more effective, discreet, and competent than they actually are, which is probably pretty embarrassing for the CIA. Another tell-tale sign is just views of history that sound like they come from a weird fairytale:</p>

<p><strong>CCP Bootlickers</strong></p>



<p><em>Examples: <a href="https://twitter.com/CarlZha">Carl Zha</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/shaunrein">Shaun Rein</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Tom_Fowdy">Tom Fowdy</a>, that one fratbro you studied abroad in Shanghai with for a semester and who really hit it off with the nephew of the Deputy Chair of the District Party Committee when you all went out clubbing once and then decided he was never going back to Arkansas, ever</em>,<em> because this place is great</em></p>



<p>Unlike Tankies, the Bootlicker is not convincingly Marxist, although they may nominally claim to be for the sake of convenience. They prefer to expound upon the superiority of the People’s Republic in more platitudinous terms, like pictures of ethnic minorities dancing happily. They generally have direct experience living and working in China, or are from there themselves, which helps explain why they are not real Marxists, because if they were, they might get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasic_incident">steamrolled by the CCP</a>. In reality, the bootlickers just subscribe the what may be termed <strong>“Socialism with Suck-up Characteristics.”</strong></p>



<p>The Bootlicker can be driven by any combination of motives, such as financial interest in China, nationalism, and/or contrarianism. For Shaun Rein, for instance, it appears to be a combination of all three. There’s also the fact that his mother-in-law is the daughter Marshal Ye Jianying, who was a member of the CCP Politburo in the 1970s and 80s. </p>

Using the model option can avoid the conflict in such cases.</p></blockquote><p><code>v-model</code> is well-known for two-way binding. <code>input</code> is the default update event. The value can be updated via <code>$emit</code>. The only limitation is that the component needs an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> tag to bind with the <code>value</code> prop.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>my-checkbox</span> <span>v-model</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>val<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>my-checkbox</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>template</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

One such specialty is calculating the 8-digit root of a 13th power of 100 digits. Achieving record times historically required massive memorization and calculating speed, racing through a procedure that remains a mystery to most people. Part I of this essay provides a historical overview of the extraction of 13th roots, including the methods used by a few mental calculators, methods that largely rely on a mix of intensive mental calculation and large-scale rote memorization. It demonstrates the creativity and drive of these&nbsp; marvelous people.</p>
<p>In Part II of this essay we will propose a new method for 13th roots like those posed to lightning calculators that is relatively easy to learn, one that makes this feat feasible for those of us with basic mental math capabilities and a desire to do something amazing. A printer-friendly PDF version of Parts I and II is linked at the end of this essay.</p>

<p><strong>Why 13th Roots?</strong></p>
<p>It is generally known that the difficulty of mentally solving for integer roots depends on the number of digits in the root rather than the number of digits in the power. So why did the 13th root of a 100-digit number become the standard?</p>
<p>First, the appeal of a prime power must be acknowledged. Square root extraction is another popular category in itself. Composite roots such as the 4th root or 12th root can be calculated as a sequence of roots of their factors (two square roots to get a 4th root, followed by a cube root to get a 12th root). In fact, for a given number of digits in the root, even-numbered roots are more difficult because the final digit of an odd root can be found from the final digit of the power. It turns out that orders of powers that are one more than a multiple of 4 (such as the 13th power) have a root with the same final digit, while orders of powers that are one less than a multiple of 4 (such as a cube) have a root with a unique final digit relative to the final digit of the power. So here we have the first clue: the final digit of a 13th root will be the same as that of the power.</p>
<p>Second, 100 is an impressive round number of digits, and this produces a 13th root consisting of 8 digits. This number of digits proves to be non-trivial while not beyond the capabilities of the best mental calculators. If there were only 3 digits in the root of an odd power, the problem is easy. The final digit is found from the rules just described. The first digit can be inferred from memorized or estimated ranges of the powers. The properties of modular arithmetic can reveal the middle digit; here the root and power are replaced with remainders after division by an integer while still retaining the 13th power relationship, and we can deduce the missing digit.</p>
<p>For example, consider the 3-digit root of an odd power such as 24137569. Since 200<sup>3</sup> = 8000000 and 300<sup>3</sup>=27000000, we know the root has a 2 as the first digit. Since 3 is one less than a multiple of 4, the final digit of the root will not necessarily equal that of the power, but there will be a unique mapping—in this case 9<sup>3</sup> ends in 9 so the last digit is in fact 9 and we are left with 2b9, where b is unknown. The remainder when a number N is divided by 11 (or N mod 11) can be found by subtracting the odd-place digits from the even place digits and repeating, adding 11’s until the result lies between 0 and 10. Here 24137569 mod 11 = (9+5+3+4) – (6+7+1+2) = 5. Now (2b9)<sup>3</sup> mod 11 must equal 5 as well. So [(9+2) – b]<sup>3</sup> mod 11 =&nbsp; (11 – b)<sup>3</sup> mod 11 = 5. As noted above, for cube roots there is a unique mapping between n and n<sup>3</sup> mod 11 and this mapping would be memorized by the mental calculator. Here we can see that 3<sup>3</sup> mod 11 = 5 since 27 = 22+5, so 11–b = 3 or b = 8. So the cube root of 24137569 is 289.</p>
<p>For the 13th root of a 100-digit number, the first digit is always 4, and we know the last digit is the same as the power. But the 13th root has 8 digits and 7992563 possibilities so there is much more ambiguity, even when the performer has memorized long tables of 2-digit or 3-digit sets of beginning and ending digits. For this reason, the <em>Guinness Book of World Records</em> created the category of 13th root extraction of 100-digit numbers, recording in the eleventh edition of 1972 a time of 23 minutes by Herbert B. de Grote of Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>Historical Methods</strong></p>
<p>In the years since de Grote’s initial record, great efforts have been taken to solve 13th roots, and as a result the times required for it have steadily decreased. Here we will discuss three of the major players in this field: Wim Klein, Gert Mittring and Alexis Lemaire.</p>

He eventually attained a record time in 1981 of 1 minute 28 seconds to calculate the 13th root of</p>
<p>88008443440489299575219015772236417859411720052615<br>
65487280650870412023307854274990144578442271602817</p>
<p>He found the answer to be 48757377.</p>
<p>How did he calculate these roots? Klein used logarithms to find the first five digits, and then used his knowledge of 13th root endings and modular arithmetic to deduce the last three digits. To find the logarithms he would factor the initial digits and add up those 5-digit logarithms from memory, interpolating between values as needed for offsets. Then he would divide by 13 and use the reverse process to find the antilogarithm, the number whose logarithm would be that value. This would be the initial five digits of the root. It is far easier said than done.</p>
<p>Smith [1983] discussed with Klein his method for finding the 13th root of</p>
<p>14762420839370760705665953772022217870318956930659<br>
27236796230563061507768203333609354957218480390144</p>
<p>Here is Smith’s account of Klein’s procedure:</p>
<hr>
<p>The first five digits of the root are fixed through the use of logarithms. Klein has memorized to five places the logs of the integers up to 150; this, coupled with his ability to factor large numbers, allows him to approximate the log of the first five digits of the power, which is usually sufficient to determine the first five digits of the root, though, as he says “the fifth digit is a bit chancy.”</p>
<p>Klein began by factoring 1,476 into 36 times 41 and taking the (decimal) log of each: log 36 = 1.55630 and log 41 = 1.61278; adding the mantissas yields 0.16908, but this is, of course, too little. Through various interpolations Klein estimated the mantissa of the log of 147,624 as 0.16925 (it is more nearly 0.16916).</p>
<p>Klein now had an approximation of the log of the 100-digit number above – 99.16925. This must be divided by 13 to obtain the log of the 13th root. Since 99=13 × 7 with a remainder of 8, to obtain the mantissa of the antilog of the 13th root he divided 8.16925 by 13, which is approximately 0.62840. He estimated the antilog to be about halfway between 4.2 and 4.3 and decided to try 4.25. The result was exact, so the first five digits of the root should be 42500, as indeed they are.</p>
<p>It is now necessary to determine the last three digits of the root. This he does from an examination of the last three digits of the power. In the case of odd powers, these uniquely determine the last three digits of the root, but in the case of even roots, like this one, this method yields four possibilities; in the case of 144 they are 014, 264, 514, and 764. (The choices always differ by 250.) To select the correct one Klein divides the original number by 13 and retains the remainder. In the case of 13th roots, the root remainder and the power remainder must be the same. The power remainder is 7; only 764 as the final three digits of the root will yield 7 as the remainder. Thus the 13th root is determined to be 42,500,764.</p>
<hr>
<p>As we will see, there are multiple endings possible when the 13th power ends in 2, 4, 6, or 8, so these are not going to be record attempts. In fact, the above account appears to be unique; other accounts of 13th roots are limited to odd final digits, and the method described in Part II of this paper is also limited to odd final digits.</p>
<p>Here is Klein’s account for another 13th power, also from Smith:</p>
<p>75185285487713563581947553291145079861723813162341<br>
53935861550997297991815299022662358976308065985831</p>
<hr>
<p>The first five digits of the power are 75185, which is nearly 7519, and 7519 is 73 times 103. The mantissa of the log of 73 is 0.86332 and that of 103 is 0.01284. Their sum is 0.87616. Dividing 8.87616 by 13 yields 0.68278. This falls between the mantissas of the logs of 48 and 49, but is much closer to 48. Since 481 is 13 (mantissa 0.11394) times 37 (mantissa 0.56820), the mantissa of its log will be 0.68214; close, but still a bit low; 4,816 can be factored into 16 (mantissa 0.20412) times 7 (mantissa 0.84510) times 43 (mantissa 0.63347). This gives a mantissa of 0.68269. Then 4,818 factors into 66 (mantissa 0.81954) times 73 (mantissa 0.86332), which yields a mantissa of 0.68286. Thus, in the interpolation we want 9/17 of 20 which is about 10 1/2. The first five digits of the root should be 48170 (48160 + 10). This, in fact, is correct.</p>
<p>When Klein actually did the calculation he made a minor error (he was looking for the antilog of 0.68277 instead of 0.68278) and first took 48169 for the first five digits of the root. In this case, however, since the root is odd, the last three digits are uniquely fixed—since the power ends in 831, the root must end in 311. Upon dividing the power by 13 Klein got a remainder of 7. But dividing 48,169,311 by 13 gives a remainder of 8. To make these two remainders come into line he changed his solution to 48,170,311, which is correct.</p>

<p>I’ll confess: I use a GUI for Git. Not always, and not even most of the time. The CLI is usually quicker, and I’m usually in the terminal anyway, but yet I also use a GUI. Why? Primarily for reviewing diffs and history, or for performing rarely used operations. I mean, I can google “cherry pick” for those rare times I use it, or I can choose it from the menu and not worry about mangling things in Git history.</p>



<p>I’m a long-time user of <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/mac">Tower</a> on macOS. It’s beautiful, intuitive, feature-rich, and powerful. Updates come frequently, and they even have <a href="https://stuff.git-tower.com/">cool merch</a>. I have <a href="https://stuff.git-tower.com/products/the-dev-manifesto">this</a> hanging by my desk at the office I haven’t seen since mid-March. I assume it’s still there. They also offer <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/windows">Tower for Windows</a>. What they <em>don’t</em> have, however, is a Linux version (preemptive snark: “That’s because people who use Linux don’t use GUIs!”).</p>



<h2>Closed Source: GitKraken</h2>



<p>I <a href="https://www.slant.co/topics/242/~best-graphical-git-clients-for-linux">asked Slant what Linux Git GUI was best</a>, sifted through some editor plugins and “minimal” clients, and decided to try <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/">GitKraken</a>. I’d tried GitKraken on macOS years ago, and thought it had promise. Back then, though, I’d already cast my lot (and my money) with Tower, so I never dug into GitKraken. Now, it was time.</p>



<p>I installed GitKraken and began using it. It ticked all the boxes for me: intuitive, beautiful, and feature-rich. After a few days using it, I decided to show my support by purchasing a license (preemptive snark: “People who use Linux don’t pay for software!”). GitKraken offers three flavors:</p>



<ol><li>Free (“For open source developers”)</li><li>Individual (“For individual developers” — $29/year)</li><li>Pro (“For teams and companies” — $49/year)</li></ol>



<p>See more information on <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/pricing">their page</a>. Among other things, Individual lets you access private repositories. Pro adds enterprise features: user management, GitHub Enterprise, etc. The tiers and features make sense. It’s a reasonable approach. Since I have no enterprise needs, but I <em>do</em> want to work with private repositories, I paid $29 for an Individual license. And I continued to use GitKraken.</p>



<p>After some days or weeks of use, I decided to really dig into GitKraken’s settings and understand its suite of offerings. I found the Preferences screens, and saw I could configure an External Editor and a Default Terminal. When I tried to select a different editor, I saw that my only option was “&lt;None&gt;”:</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.grailbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/preferences.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.grailbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/preferences.png 484w, https://www.grailbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/preferences-300x99.png 300w, https://www.grailbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/preferences-320x105.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px"><figcaption>GitKraken Preferences</figcaption></figure>



<p>I poked around a little bit in the UI, ran a few google searches, and came up empty on how to resolve this. I saw a menu item in GitKraken, though, that said, “Send Us Feedback,” so I sent the following:</p>



<blockquote><p>I’m using GitKraken 7.0 on Pop!_os 20.04. In Preferences -&gt; General, both the External Editor and Default Terminal dropdowns have &lt;None&gt; as the only option. How can I configure these?</p></blockquote>



<p>The reply came back:</p>



<blockquote><p>Thank you for taking the time to reach out to support. We currently do not provide support for free accounts. For guaranteed support please upgrade to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/pricing"><strong>GitKraken Pro</strong></a>. Additionally, it’s important to note that the GitKraken Git GUI does not support Pop!_OS. Our team does not test again this distro and we cannot guarantee that the GitKraken Git GUI will behave properly. If you have installed the GUI via snap please try one of the alternative install options detailed here, https://support.gitkraken.com/how-to-install/#linux-deb-rpm-and-targz-files. If you require additional assistance please upgrade to GitKraken Pro.</p></blockquote>



<p>I assumed a mistake had occurred — true, I didn’t have a Pro account, but nor was I using a Free account. I started to reply that I wasn’t a Free user, but first I checked the features of the different pricing tiers. Indeed, they provide email support only for the Pro edition. A customer paying at the Individual level has no support recourse. The support individual hadn’t made a mistake (other than getting my license wrong) — he had followed protocol. Now, I felt a little miffed. Dismissed. At the least, they could have said something like: “Thanks for pointing this out. We are developing a support document that addresses where this information comes from to help you troubleshoot,” or something that sounded like they cared. Still, I hadn’t done my homework when I made my purchase. The terms were right there. I should have paid more attention.</p>



<p>I briefly considered throwing them $20 more just so they’d have to fix this for me, but realized they’d almost certainly stand firm on not supporting Pop!_OS. So I reformatted my hard drive and installed Ubuntu . . . just kidding. I kept my $20. And I tried to solve this myself. Things I tried:</p>



<ul><li>Find the configuration file: check</li><li>Add good-guess entries to the configuration file: didn’t work</li><li>Install VS Code to see if it it would show up in the dropdown: didn’t work</li><li>Install and configure GitKraken on my MacBook Pro with an External Editor and see what the configuration file should <em>really</em> look like: check</li><li>Duplicate the configuration file on my Linux box: didn’t work</li></ul>



<p>At this point, I ran out of steam. GitKraken is an Electron app, if I’m not mistaken, so I suppose I could have tried digging into obfuscated JavaScript. I’ve seen what WebPack can do, though, and I also figured the license I’d agreed to prevented such action, so I surrendered and looked for another Git GUI.</p>



<h2>Open Source: Guitar</h2>



<p>I don’t remember how I found <a href="https://github.com/soramimi/Guitar">Guitar</a> — I assumed Slant, but I don’t see it now on the list so must have been a random Internet search that led me to it. I installed it, used it, and liked it. Not quite as intuitive or beautiful as GitKraken, but I soon got the hang of it and I was off and running.</p>



<p>One day, though, I wanted to amend a commit. In Tower, the commit dialog has a checkbox for amending a commit. Guitar has no such checkbox. I poked around a little, then dashed to the command line to amend the commit and made a mental note to follow up.</p>



<p>When I got around to following up, I found <a href="https://github.com/soramimi/Guitar/issues/53">this issue</a> asking for an option to amend a commit. The response from the developer pointed out that the option existed, albeit using a different interface mechanism: a context menu. I right-clicked one of my commits in the Guitar GUI and didn’t see the “Edit message…” option. I didn’t understand why. This time, though, I could do something about it.</p>



<p>I cloned the Guitar repository, fired up <a href="https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools">Qt Creator</a>, followed <a href="https://github.com/soramimi/Guitar/blob/master/docs/build_guide-en/build_guide_origin.md">the build instructions</a>, and was able to launch Guitar in the debugger. I looked through the code, which was clean and straightforward. Easy to follow — and this, for a guy who only recently learned that <a href="https://ariya.io/2009/01/qt-not-qt">Qt is pronounced “cute.”</a> (Note: I find that pronunciation more unsettling than Jay-Double-you-Tee being pronounced “jot,” but no one consulted me on either.)</p>



<p>I soon found the part of the code that draws the context menu in question, set a breakpoint, and stepped through the code. I learned that it adds that menu item to the context menu of a commit if:</p>



<ul><li>It’s the latest commit</li><li>There are no uncommitted changes in the working copy</li><li>The commit has not been pushed to a remote</li></ul>



<p>So the feature works as the developer designed: you can edit the message, but not the content, of the commit. In other words, you can’t add a file to a commit to amend it. And I could figure all that out because the code was open source. I could see it. Step through it. Know exactly what was happening. And I can change that behavior, if I want, and offer it to others who want the same behavior.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Here’s where I say that Open Source is categorically better than Closed Source. I can’t do it, though. It’s not categorically better. It’s better in some ways and worse in others. It optimizes some things at the expense of others. It worked in my favor, above, allowing me to troubleshoot and resolve my own issue.</p>



<p>As commercial software, however, GitKraken generates sufficient revenue to have (presumably) developers, designers, product owners, and support staff working on it full time. It’s more intuitive and better looking than Guitar. It offers ticket tracking boards and project timelines and integration with other tools. And as long as you pay $49/year and run a supported operating system, you can get email support for it. In contrast, I’m guessing that Guitar is a side project for <a href="https://github.com/soramimi">its developer</a>. They get no money from it. It puts no food on the table. They work on it as they have time. And I keep saying “they” because English has no genderless singular third-person pronoun, but you can see <a href="https://github.com/soramimi/Guitar/graphs/contributors">soramimi does most of the work</a>. It’s a labor of love, and a gift to the community. </p>



<p>This is where the pedant points out that you don’t have to be closed source to be commercial. That’s true only in theory, as the recent <a href="https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/issues/4111">hapi flap</a> reminds us.</p>



<p>Life is full of trade-offs. Software is one of them. I’ll go on using some closed source and some open source, paying for some software and using some for free. I’m going to thank the developer of Guitar for all their work. I’ll be writing a patch for Guitar that allows you to amend a commit by adding a file. I’ll check it in using a Git GUI. I’ll let you guess which one.</p>

<h2>Fair Use and Exigent Circumstances</h2>



<p>

*<em>The opinions and scholarship communicated on this website are the author’s own, expressed in his personal capacity.*</em></p>



<p>If you work in any of the higher ed institutions that are preparing to move online – maybe your copyright world has exploded in a range of questions on fair use, e-reserves, online access, scanning, digitization, and more! I am sure many of you, especially in the library community, are working towards the best solution for students, faculty, staff, and patrons in this time of crisis. </p>



<p>To help you navigate this process, over the next few posts  (working as I go) I will offer reminders of all the super awesome legal tools libraries have for copyright as “stewards of access” in our communities.</p>



<p>As I have often messaged, libraries and archives have “superpowers” under the copyright law that allows us to supply our communities with access to materials for research, scholarship, and study. Most notably, these statutory exemptions were granted to libraries and archives by Congress to ensure our continued public mission. Further, libraries can utilize technology to <em>enhance</em> access to materials. Adapting and utilizing technology for the benefit of our patrons is something that libraries and archives have been successful at for decades – from the first photocopiers in libraries, microfiche, computer labs,  to 3-D printers! </p>



<p>So, in times like this COVID-19 crisis, let’s continue to harness both law and technology to help!</p>



<p>Before I get to the TEACH Act, Section 108, or any other superpower – first and foremost, we must talk about <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107">fair use</a>. While this isn’t a library superpower – <strong>fair use is for everyone!</strong> – it certainly falls to the libraries and archives, in many circumstances, to be the champions of fair use on campus (and bust any fair use myths!)</p>



<figure><img src="https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Fair-Use-Rosie-1024x557.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Fair-Use-Rosie-1024x557.jpg 1024w, https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Fair-Use-Rosie-300x163.jpg 300w, https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Fair-Use-Rosie-768x418.jpg 768w, https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Fair-Use-Rosie.jpg 1409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>In questions I’ve received, tweets I’ve been following, and posts to the Copyright First Responders lists about libraries’ responses to COVID-19, what is pervasive is the sense that this isn’t a normal “par for the course” moment. These are exigent circumstances with a limited timeline, and we, as libraries, have a strong mission and public purpose. In response to the COVID-19 public health crisis and ensuing campus closures, we can make use of the “release valve” that fair use offers. We have a lot of space to support our communities in this moment as long as we’re being thoughtful, <em>providing good copyright information when asked</em>, and limiting our activities to the&nbsp;specific, <em>time-bound needs</em> of instructors and students for the rest of the semester. In doing so, we are applying fair use prudently and managing risk sensibly. We are not crafting permanent policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortunately, copyright law does not always restrict uses. In many cases a solid understanding of fair use can help ease fears, provide legal alternatives to a particular request, or help educate the higher education community at large. </p>



<p>Again, as long as we’re being thoughtful, <em>providing good copyright information when asked</em>, and limiting our activities to the&nbsp;specific, <em>time-bound needs</em> of our communities for the rest of this timeline, we are in a good place to have a strong fair use analysis. <br></p>



<p>Yes, we are still applying fair use prudently and managing risk sensibly, but we can do that and clearly meet our user’s needs!  </p>



<p>Just to be clear: Fair use is a flexible limitation on copyright which states “Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106” (the copyright owner’s rights) “the fair use of a copyrighted work…for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research” is not an infringement of copyright. And then we are given the famous four-factor test to make that risk determination.</p>



<p>Again, let me emphasize “<strong>flexible!</strong>” Fair use is flexible and, as the Supreme Court stated in<em> <a href="https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/assets/files/2LiveCrew.pdf">Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.</a></em><a href="https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/assets/files/2LiveCrew.pdf">, 510 U.S. 569 (1994)</a> “permits and requires courts to avoid rigid application of the copyright statute.” So, if fair use is found, it is, according to the Copyright Act, “not an infringement of copyright.”</p>



<p>The
mechanics underpinning fair use were codified in the Copyright Act with the
famous four factors: 1) the purpose and character of the use, 2) the nature of
the work copied, 3) the amount and substantiality of the work used, and 4) the
effect on the market for the original. One has to examine all four factors for
each individual use to make a fair use determination. </p>



<p>For
the purposes of this blog post, let’s explore a fictional request to scan some
materials for a class that is forced to move to online as a result of a
COVID-19 closure. Below we will make our way through each of the four factors with
an eye to ask some questions and gain an understanding of making a fair use determination
for this sort of scenario.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fair-use-four.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fair-use-four.jpg 296w, https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fair-use-four-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px"></figure></div>



<p><strong>Fair Use Factor One – Purpose and Character:</strong> The first fair use factor, “purpose and character of the use,” is illustrated by the examples that is part of the fair use statute preamble: <em>criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship or research.</em> Clearly our colleagues working at non-profit educational institutions have a good start for a fair use determination right away. Our use is clearly for the benefit of research and education!  </p>



<p>Additionally, let’s put this first factor in the context of the COVID-19 closure scenario. Well, this particular “purpose” is allowing faculty and students to access the materials they need in a public emergency where they are facing quarantines, social distancing, or campus/library closures. This is strong evidence, I believe, for favoring fair use in the “purpose and character” factor. </p>



<p><strong>Fair Use Factor Two – Nature of Copyrighted Work:</strong> </p>



<p>When
determining whether our COVID-19-related scanning request is a fair use under
the second factor, we must ask ourselves a couple of questions about the work
at hand: Is it published or unpublished; and how “creative” is the original
work?</p>



<p>While
the law is more protective of unpublished work, because authors have right to
decide whether and when they will make their work public, courts have largely
ignored this factor, with some calling it “neutral” in many recent decisions.
Certainly, many higher ed courses use both factual works and creative works.</p>



<p>Certainly do not see this factor as dispositive of the entire fair use test – let’s move forward to the next factor!</p>



<p><strong>Fair Use Factor Three – Amount and Substantiality Used:</strong> The third factor receives major discussion in both court cases and scholarship surrounding fair use. A common question that examines this factor derives directly from the critical facts in most fair use cases: <em>How much is being used?</em> If it’s a smaller amount of a copyrighted work, it favors fair use. But what about a request for an entire work?</p>



<p><strong>Well, despite any myths you may have heard, it can be fair to use an entire work</strong>. However, it must be a justified fair use. The important thing to remember is that the law favors using the right amount necessary to serve the users purpose. There are no bright lines when it comes to what percentage of the copyrighted work is too much and typically, the higher the percentage, the more likely this factor is to count against fair use.</p>



<p>However, let’s apply this to a new common COVID-19 scenario: The use of a book when the campus moves online. Maybe we consider that we do not scan the whole textbook, unless it is absolutely necessary. And it may be absolutely necessary! And it also may not be! The factor is assessed based on the facts of the scenario.</p>



<p>For example, a class may have already covered Chapters 1-7 for the first part of the semester – and now, moving online, they need chapters 8, 9, 10, and 11 to finished out the semester. The library may have used fair use analysis to tailored this request to the needs of the faculty and students. This action is employing part of the fair use rationale that states that one should use only the amount necessary to serve the purpose.</p>



<p>The syllabus certainly helps with calculating the need and amount used. I have observed recommendations making materials available to students that are measured by the class syllabus <strong>from the “move online” moment </strong>to the<strong> end of the semester.</strong> Now, that might be more than any library policy “rules of thumb” that normally exist. But again, this is not the normal policy – and wouldn’t be representative of the factual scenarios we are being presented with now with the COVD-19 crisis. Fair use decisions are rendered case-by-case, thankfully, and we can look to amount needed as necessary to serve the purpose.</p>



<p>Now, here’s another novel issue. What if the student needs access to the book for studying for the final test? Chapters 1-7, which were previously only available on reserve (or left behind in the abandoned dorm room) are now inaccessible. Can we expand the digitization request beyond chapters 8, 9, 10, and 11 to finished out the semester ? Again, we have to look at the limited use, timing, and exigent circumstances of this scenario. Use the same standard as always used under factor three: <em>the use should use only copy the amount necessary to serve the purpose </em></p>



<p><strong>Fair Use Factor Four – Market Effect:</strong> This is another factor that gets a lot of discussion both in the fair use court cases and commentary. The question often revolves around whether the proposed use will cut into the potential market or value of the work. And we have seen court cases stating that using a copyrighted work in a way that means lost sales to the copyright owner will weigh against fair use.</p>



<p>This
last factor gets a lot of discussion both in fair use court cases and
commentary. The question often revolves around whether the proposed use will cut
into the potential market or value of the work.And court cases have

      <p>
        The <a href="https://github.com/alexkuc/remote-dev-server-scripts#requirements">repository</a> contains a concise summary. It contains the bare minimum required to get started. The aim of this article is to provide more in-depths tutorial.
      </p>
      
      <div>
        <p>
          In <a href="https://alexkuc.github.io/articles/create-remote-dev-server/" target="_blank">part one</a>, I have shown how to create a remote development using DigitalOcean and rsync. In part two, I will show how to automate the entire process using Bash script.
        </p>
        <p>
          To get started, you will need to install and configure the dependencies:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>DigitalOcean account</li>
          <li>Bash, at least version 4</li>
          <li>doctl</li>
          <li>rsync (<code>do.sh sync</code>)</li>
          <li>fswatch (<code>do.sh watch</code>)</li>
          <li>scp (<code>do.sh copy</code> <code>do.sh scp</code>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once that is done, clone <a href="https://github.com/alexkuc/remote-dev-server-scripts" target="_blank">the repository</a>. You can either set it up as a sub-module or as a standalone repo. To make <code>do.sh</code> be accessible from anywhere, copy it or symlink it into your <code>PATH</code>, e.g. <code>/usr/local/bin</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The droplet can be configured using either Bash or yaml configs where examples of both are available in the repository. You would need to call the script either from one level up from <code>do.sh</code> or export environment variable <code>CLOUD_CONFIG</code> with a different path.
        </p>
        <p>
          This script allows a certain degree of flexibility via <a href="#env-vars">environment variables</a>. For instance, the config used can be specified via <code>CLOUD_CONFIG</code>. If you require a greater degree of customizability, you can either submit a PR or fork the repository.

          Using <code>do.sh</code> is very simple. To get started, type <code>do.sh help</code> which will show you a list of available commands. <em>Some</em> commands support chaining, e.g., <code>do.sh up prep sync</code> which will run in sequential order. Generally, you can chain commands which have a fixed number of arguments such as <code>up</code> or <code>down</code>. Commands like <code>ssh</code>, <code>cmd</code> and <code>copy</code> can have any number of arguments so these do not support chaining. A good workaround is to add these commands at the very end, e.g. <code>do.sh up copy file1 file2 file3</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below is a list of available commands: <code>up         create dev server *
down       destory dev server *
reset      re-create dev server *
sync       rsync from local to remote *
watch      watch local for changes and sync
deps       install Node deps on remote *
prep[are]  shortcut for sync -&gt; deps -&gt; watch
ssh        start interactive ssh session
ssh &lt;cmd&gt;  execute command on droplet
cmd &lt;cmd&gt;  ssh &lt;cmd&gt; and replace cwd with local
scp &lt;path&gt; copy from remote to local (cwd)
copy&lt;path&gt; copy from local to remote (~/.repo/)
cp &lt;path&gt;  alias to copy command
dist       shortcut to copying dist/ from remote *
host       show public ip of remote *
config     create config from env var CLOUD_CONFIG *
help       show available commands

* these commands support chaining, e.g. do.sh up prep sync</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is an example of my workflow. I start with <code>up</code>, followed by <code>prep</code>. As this script supports chaining, here is what I do: <code>do.sh up prep</code>. If I need to run a command after copying files, I execute <code>do.sh sync cmd &lt;cmd&gt;</code>. Path re-write is useful if I want to be able to copy and paste path from the error stack straight away (<code>cmd</code>). For instance, I use iTerm which supports semantic history and with path re-write, I can open files directly from console on my local system.
        </p>

          This script supports so-called settings via environment variables overrides. Here is a list of supported overrides:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>NAME</code> name of the droplet, defaults to <code>dev-server</code></li>

          <li><code>SPECS</code> droplet specs, defaults to <code>s-2vcpu-2gb</code>; find out more specs by running <code>doctl compute size list</code></li>
          <li><code>REGION</code> droplet datacenter, defaults to <code>lon1</code></li>
          <li><code>CLOUD_CONFIG</code> location of cloud config, defaults to <code>./dev-server/cloud-config.yml</code></li>
          <li><code>SSH_KEY</code> local path to private ssh key, defaults to <code>~/.ssh/developer</code></li>
          <li><code>SSH_USER</code> ssh user, defaults to <code>developer</code></li>
          <li><code>SSH_HOST</code> ssh host, defaults to none; the value is configured at runtime when <code>up</code> command is run and saved to <code>SSH_OUTPUT</code></li>
          <li><code>SSH_SOCKET</code> local path for ssh socket, defaults to none; once <code>SSH_HOST</code> is available, the value becomes <code>${HOME}/.ssh/sockets/$SSH_USER@$SSH_HOST</code></li>
          <li><code>SSH_CWD</code> value of <code>pwd</code> on remote host, configured at runtime</li>
          <li><code>LOCAL_CWD</code> value of <code>pwd</code> on local host</li>
          <li><code>SSH_HOST_FILE</code> local path where <code>SSH_HOST</code> value is saved, defaults to <code>/tmp/dev_ssh_host</code></li>
          <li><code>SSH_CWD_FILE</code> local path where <code>pwd</code> of remote host is saved, defaults to <code>/tmp/dev_ssh_cwd</code></li>

July 24, 2020 | https://maxkostinevich.com/blog/serverless-geolocation/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://maxkostinevich.com/blog/serverless-geolocation/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>If you ever tried to make a Geo-location service (e.g. define a user country based on user IP address), most likely you heard about <a href="https://www.maxmind.com/">MaxMind</a>. </p>
<p>MaxMind - is probably one of best companies who provides Geo IP databases and services. </p>
<p>However, there is a number of limitations: if you're making a side-project, most likely you do not want to pay extra $$$ for geolocation services. And for this case MaxMind offers GeoLite2 database, however you'll be in charge of hosting this database on your server and making regular updates of the database. You also need to make sure your project is compliant with MaxMind's License.</p>
<h2>Why to use Cloudflare Workers instead of AWS Lambda?</h2>
<p>In this particular example, I needed a simple geo-location service which will be used in embeddable javascript code (similar to Google Analytics or other tracking service), so the response time is quite crucial.</p>
<p>In my first attempt I tried to use Serverless framework to host simple geo-location function on AWS Lambda (this function uses MaxMind GeoLite2 database). However, I quickly realized that the response time isn't what I've expected - on average the response took somewhere between from 200ms to 500ms. So I started looking for other options.  </p>
<p>So, I thought - if I could not host it on AWS Lambda, where else I could host my serverless function? The next service I tried - is <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Workers</a>. I created a simple function to test the reponse time, and it was really impressive - on average it was between from 30ms to 80ms, I've got almost x10 better performance in comparison to AWS. </p>
<p>However, this solution had one really big caveat - MaxMind GeoLite2 database does not work on Cloudflare Workers due to some runtime limitations.</p>
<h2>MaxMind alternative</h2>
<p>And then I thought - hey, wait a second, as Cloudflare provides DDoS protection services, they might provide some interesting features in Cloudflare Workers. And after exploring their documentation, I realized that the <code>Request</code> object in function have an access to <code>cf</code> object, which contains some useful information about the visitor, including visitor's country!</p>
<p>That's exactly what I was looking for, within a few dozens of lines of code I got my geolocation function up and running.</p>
<h2>The source code</h2>
<p>If you haven't worked with Cloudflare before, you need to signup at <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare.com</a> and go to Workers directory.</p>
<p>Then, create a new worker with the following source code:</p>

<p>Then you can start making requests to your Worker's endpoint.</p>    </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Since the GPT-3's demos have stormed Twitter, more and more devs are getting anxious about how this would affect their jobs in the future. I think the tweet that has struck the developers the most is the one by Sharif Shameen</p>

<p>If anyone can create UI and generate React code just by describing it in plain English, why would any company hire a Frontend Developer anymore? </p>
<p>Let's start by getting a little more context about GPT-3</p>
<h2 id="what-is-gpt-3-">What is GPT-3?</h2>

<p><strong>Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) — 3,</strong> in simple words, is a pre-trained model that can explore the internet for answers and generate responses in a contextual way. This is why it is able to start giving predictions even when provided with a small input. You can check out Paul's demo for more context.</p>

<h2 id="how-gpt-3-will-help-evolve-your-jobs-rather-than-taking-it">How GPT-3 will help evolve your jobs rather than taking it</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"With Products like <a href="http://debuild.co/" target="_blank">debuild.co</a>, should we even bother learning Frontend development?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fear of AI taking on all our jobs has been the topic of discussion for years now, and since GPT-3, developers are able to see this happening to them sooner than later.  This is the same situation when people were of the impression that firebase will kill backend jobs, and products like Netlify and Vercel will kill Cloud engineering jobs, but on the contrary, all these services have played a role in increasing the job market. It has been empowering more and more startups to rise up with low initial investment, and these startups in turn hire more engineers when they want to scale up.</p>
<p>In my opinion, one should consider GPT-3 to be the milestone in AI which will lead us to the next evolution of the way we work. </p>

<h2 id="the-concept-of-priming-in-gpt-3-models">The Concept of Priming in GPT-3 models</h2>
<p>The biggest reason why GPT-3 is a potential game-changer in AI tech is that anyone can use this without having to find a dataset for the ML to start predicting as expected, few inputs will help you get exceptional results. That being said the quality of input is definitely a factor for the results that you get. This is where the concept of priming comes up. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Priming is giving the model a series of input and expected outputs which should be easy for the model to calculate context and create a guide for itself for future inputs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I highly recommend you to look into <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/@IntuitMachine">Carlos' pieces</a> if you want to dive deeper into how priming works starting from the one mentioned below</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/intuitionmachine/the-subtle-art-of-priming-gpt-3-bc12f67c9777">The Subtle Art of Priming GPT-3</a></p>
<p>According to the material that is out there as of now, it seems that using GPT-3, it would become extremely easy to create a super tool for a niche use-case, but there is still time for it to be mature enough to replace a whole field of work. </p>

<p>You can follow Swyx's repo to be up to date with all things GPT-3</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/sw-yx/gpt3-list">sw-yx/gpt3-list</a></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>GPT-3 is the closest we can get to have something like Jarvis from Iron man so that should be something that can be exciting</p>
<p>I think the best way to handle this new progress in AI is to sit tight and be curious about how this can change the way developers would be building products in the future.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: This blog is all written without any help of GPT-3</em> 😂</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I am waiting for my GPT beta invite like:

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>
<a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">Glamorous Toolkit</a> is now beta. This is the first usable incarnation of our vision of moldable development. We still have plenty of things we want to do, but now we can say that the large technical challenges are behind us.
</p>
<p>
Many things have changed since our previous release from a year ago. The GitHub repository says we addressed more than 900 issues spanning from deep technical issues to creating a whole new visible user interface. Essentially, much of the current system has been developed or redeveloped during last year.
</p>
<p>
Let's take a tour through the highlights.
</p>
<p>
Before we look at the cool technical details, let's pause for a second and consider our goal of making the inside of software systems explainable. To reach this goal, first and foremost, we focus on reimagining how developers read code. Glamorous Toolkit does bring innovations in how we write code, but it is the reading where we make the most difference. Developers alone spend 50+% of their time reading code. That is the single largest activity in software development and we reimagine how this effort is being spent from the ground up. The result is what we call moldable development and we are now confident in saying that it is a novel way of approaching programming. 
</p>
<p>
To get a feeling of what it means, please scroll down and look briefly at the screenshots. Notice how they look rather distinct from one another. Software is highly contextual. We want the environment to mold to that context and depict it distinctly, too.
</p>
<p>
Ok, enough of that. Let's go on with the show.
</p>
<p>
A good chunk of the effort went into making Glamorous Toolkit run in native windows reliably. We are now happy to announce that it now works for Mac, Windows and Linux.
</p>

	<figcaption>The home tab of Glamorous Toolkit</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
This is an important step not only for the looks of it, but also internally. If until now we were bootstrapping inside the graphical support from Pharo, now we get to control the complete rendering. We are still able to spawn the old Morphic World interface on demand. In this way, people that are used to Pharo can enjoy the interface of the new environment while still being able to rely on old tools when needed.
</p>
<p>
To be able a high degree of moldability, the environment's frame must impose little constraints.
</p>
<p>
In our case, the frame essentially knows a home tab that we can easily mold, a menu that we can make moldable, and a way to search that is already moldable. This is it. No elaborate global menus. No hardcoded views. We can do this because the actions are bundled with the context in which they apply.
</p>
<figure>

	<figcaption>Glamorous Toolkit offers a tabbed interface</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Coder offers the means through which we manipulate static code. The work on Coder started from the need to mold  the experience for the smallest unit of code organization: the method. We started from the editor for a single method and built the rest of the experience around it.
</p>
<p>
For example, below we see a search through the system revealing methods that can be individually viewed and modified in place. In this particular case, we expand one inner method only to look for references of an instance variable, and this, in turn, opens another list on the right. Using this simple mechanism we can transform any Playground into a powerful code query tool and a scoped code browser.
</p>
<figure>

	<figcaption>Example of a queries and previews as method snippets</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Coder can be molded in several ways. For example, below we see the baseline defining the dependencies of the Bloc project. Each dependency is defined through a string denoting the name of the dependency. Coder recognizes the API and allows us to expand the string right in place to browse the corresponding dependency.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/glamorous-toolkit-v0-7-1214-beta-2uv9ne4vyynvcv08kcm07cihz/pictures/gtr-coder-baseline.png" alt="Example of a baseline method with expanded dependencies">
	<figcaption>Example of a baseline method with expanded dependencies</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
The environment is classically seen as being specific to a language. We believe moldability must be much finer grained:  all tools must be made adjustable within the context of code. In our case, we bring that ability to the individual instruction.
</p>
<p>
Playground and Inspector are the core tools that enable live exploration. They were significantly consolidated. The core mechanism remained the same, but now they are complemented with a few abilities.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/glamorous-toolkit-v0-7-1214-beta-2uv9ne4vyynvcv08kcm07cihz/pictures/gtr-playground-inspector.png" alt="Example of a Playground, connected Inspectors and an object Playground">
	<figcaption>Example of a Playground, connected Inspectors and an object Playground</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
First, error handling. Inspector is extensible by third party code. At the same time, as it is the most basic tool we have in the environment, it is critical that these extensions cannot  break the inspector. So, now we have a fine grained handlers that gracefully show errors without breaking the Inspector.
</p>
<p>
Another part is preserving the history in Playground. On each code execution we store the Playground's content on disk. This also works for code we are writing in the context of an object.
</p>
<p>
But, perhaps most important is that we brought the full coding experience into both Inspector and Playground. When inspecting an object, the Meta view offers a Coder on the class of the object. Particularly interesting is that the value of <code>self</code> is bound to the inspected object. This ability allows us to promote programming in Inspector in the presence of live objects. More recently, we went a step further and extended the Playground coding experience as well. This includes the ability to create classes and methods right in place.
</p>
<p>
A consequence is that we can now use the expansion mechanisms to peek into code wherever we are, including the Playground and Inspector. Through this, we do not go to where the code is. The code shows up where we are. That is the humane way.
</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<p>
Spotter is the moldable search interface.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/glamorous-toolkit-v0-7-1214-beta-2uv9ne4vyynvcv08kcm07cihz/pictures/gtr-spotter.png" alt="Example of a Spotter search">
	<figcaption>Example of a Spotter search</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Just like how an object can tell the Inspector how it can be viewed, it can also tell Spotter how it can be searched. This simple ability can then be combined in many different ways to support various use cases from navigating through code or the file system, to pasting external urls to open them within the environment.
</p>
<p>
While Spotter is prominently available globally, we also integrated it with Inspector and Coder. For example, when editing a class, Coder offers a Spotter to search within the context of that class.
</p>
<figure>

	<figcaption>Searching within the context of a class from within Coder</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Debugger saw significant improvements, too. The stack is made of the same snippets as found in Coder or in Playground. And it can be seamlessly integrated in the inspection flow.
</p>
<figure>

	<figcaption>A debugger and an inspector on a variable</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Documenter is the engine with which we assemble narratives. We use it for documenting classes, or we use it for describing business cases or architectural descriptions. For example, here we see a Coder with a document as a class comment. Clicking on a link opens up another document, essentially transforming the whole image into a wiki.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/glamorous-toolkit-v0-7-1214-beta-2uv9ne4vyynvcv08kcm07cihz/pictures/gtr-documenter-faces.png" alt="Browsing through live documents">
	<figcaption>Browsing through live documents</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Documenter saw several developments, and it became faster and more usable. We achieved this by making the previews render lazily.
</p>
<p>
The different tools are wired together in a broader flow we call Pager that embeds tools as pages connected in a Miller columns interface. The novelty is that tools are now first class and can appear at arbitrary locations in a larger flow.
</p>

Beside documents, another pervasive medium to express narratives are slideshows. Presenter offers exactly that, only in our case, the slides are live. Each slide is essentially a scoped environment and can be used for various purposes. For example, the Tour slideshow offers an overview of Glamorous Toolkit, each slide exemplifying a separate concept or tool.

<p>
A narrative can take multiple forms. In the environment we already have  documents or slideshows. And now we have a hybrid: A way to combine text with a target graphical scene and offer seamless links between the two.
</p>
<p>
For example, below we see an explanation text on the left. On the right, we see a piece of code denoting the definition of an inspector view and a preview of the rendering for a specific object. Hovering over the highlighted words visually link to the corresponding parts in the code and in the scene.

Visualizer makes visualization a first-class citizen in the environment. It contains a few programmable engines including Mondrian, for drawing graphs, an initial Plotter for drawing charts, or Connector, for identifying connections between various objects.

Transcript is a basic console. Now, text is quaint, but we have to outgrow it. And, you should not use Transcript for debugging purposes either. But if you must, at least you can do it with style. For example, if you have an exception that you want to print, the whole exception stack is inspectable right from the Transcript. Why? Because we can, and because doing it any other way would be not glamorous enough.

The first non-Pharo language fully supported by Glamorous Toolkit is the one of SmaCC with which we define parsers for other langauges. For example, below we see the definition of the C# parser presented similarly to how we present Pharo code. Beside the editing abilities, the integration also comes with various debugging and inspection abilities, such as a simulator. Through these tools we make the construction and evolution of parsers innexpensive.

<div>
<blockquote>LinkedIn profiles have become a powerful place to gather data on individuals. Different parties will have their own usage of LinkedIn profiles, such as LinkedIn data mining, profile research or leads generation.</blockquote><p>There are many methods out there to procure the information we need. In this tutorial, we’ll be using one of the more simple ways to obtain the data we need, which is to use <strong>Python</strong> to simulate a Google search and get ahold of the URLs returned from the search results. Further processing can be done, either manually or via automation, as we discuss in our other tutorial, <a href="https://nubela.co/blog/tutorial-how-to-build-linkedin-automation-tools-with-python-with-a-code-example/">How to Build LinkedIn Automation Tools with Python With a Code Example</a>.</p><p>The main reason for this is to get familiar with one of the most common methods of web scraping, which is browser-based scraping. For those unfamiliar, this is where we simulate human behaviour on the web by using a browser. We will utilize a tool called <strong>Selenium</strong>, which is an open-source testing framework for web applications, which allows us to start a browser through the script. Its usage goes far beyond testing, however, as we will soon demonstrate.</p><h3 id="setup-">Setup:</h3><p>Before we start, we need to set up the project and download the dependencies we need:</p><ol><li>Python 3</li><li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/selenium/"><code>selenium library</code> with chrome webdriver</a></li></ol><h3 id="step-1">Step 1</h3><p>Let’s simulate a Google search. We will be making use of one of the more unknown Google search features, which is Google search operators, also referred to as advanced operators. These are special characters and commands that help to provide a more strict criterion for our search term, hence narrowing down our search results. You can read <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/">here</a> for a comprehensive list of operators.</p><pre><code>def create_search_url(title, location, *include):
    result = ""
    base_url = "http://www.google.com/search?q=+-intitle:%22profiles%22+site:linkedin.com/in/+OR+site:linkedin.com/pub/"

    quote = lambda x: "%22" + x + "%22"

    result += base_url
    result += quote(title) + "+" + quote(location)

    for word in include:
        result += "+" + quote(word)

    return result
</code></pre><p>We first start by defining our base URL. As you can see, there are search operators already present. The <code>-intitle</code> operator tells the engine to find pages with the word 'profiles' in the title tag. We also use the <code>-inurl</code> operator to ensure we only want pages with LinkedIn profile URLs. We can specify the default profile URLs that starts with <code>linkedin.com/pub/</code> or personalised URLs that start with <code>linkedin.com/in/</code> using the <code>OR</code> operator.</p><p>Then, we narrow our search even more by using double quotation marks to use exact-matching. Since we can’t enter double quotations in a Python string, we should either use the escape character (“\”) before the quotes or use the Unicode-equivalent in the URL which is <code>%22</code>. We enter the desired title/position and the country we passed as arguments into the quotes. To make our function less rigid, we allow additional arguments if you want to specify more criteria. Anything passed as <code>include</code> will be added for exact matching.</p><p>You can test this function yourself by printing out the result and pasting that result in your browser search bar. You can actually generate more specific Google search URLs by using free online tools like <a href="https://recruitin.net/">Recruit’em XRay Search</a>.</p><h3 id="step-2">Step 2</h3><p>Now we will make use of Selenium’s WebDriver to spin up our own automated browser. We can use any of the browsers supported by Selenium (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, etc), but for now, we will use Chrome. Here we can also specify if we want to run this browser in headless mode, which is to say without the browser window popping up (no GUI), by adding <code>options.add_argument('headless')</code>.</p><pre><code>max_page = 5
all_urls = []

options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
# options.add_argument('headless')

# specifies the path to the chromedriver.exe
driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)

# always start from page 1
page = 1

driver.get(create_search_url("software engineer", "singapore", "developer", "nubela"))

while True:
    time.sleep(3)

    # find the urls
    urls = driver.find_elements_by_class_name('r')
    urls = [url.find_element_by_tag_name('a') for url in urls]
    urls = [url.get_attribute("href") for url in urls]
    all_urls = all_urls + urls

    # move to the next page
    page += 1

    if page &gt; max_page:
        print('\n end at page:' + str(page - 1))
        break

    try:
        next_page = driver.find_element_by_css_selector("a[aria-label='Page " + str(page) + "']")
        next_page.click()
    except:
        print('\n end at page:' + str(page - 1) + ' (last page)')
        break

print(all_urls)
</code></pre><p>We then navigate to the URL returned by the previous function using <code>driver.get()</code>. This will open the page on the browser. Then it's time to get our hands on the profile URLs that are on this page of Google. We can use the browser 'Inspect' developer tool to see the HTML tag of the page links. For every link on the page, the class name of the HTML <code>div</code> will be <code>r</code>. As per convention, the hyperlink, or the profile URL, will be embedded within the <code>hrefs</code> attribute of the <code>a</code> tag.</p><p>Every time we finish scraping the Google page for URLs, we navigate to the next page by finding the button using <code>driver.find_element_by_css_selector()</code> and simulating a click action. Here we specified a counter for the number of pages and a maximum page which you can set a reasonable number for. If the next page doesn't exist, then we stop our crawling and return our results.</p><h3 id="additional-steps">Additional steps</h3><p>You have now obtained the LinkedIn profile URLs that you need. Easy, right? All you have to do now is to gather data available on these profiles. Unfortunately, bulk web scraping LinkedIn itself won’t be this easy because LinkedIn has measures in place to prevent this from happening. Read our other article, <a href="https://nubela.co/blog/why-you-shouldnt-use-linkedin-automation-tools-using-your-own-account/">Why You Shouldn’t Use LinkedIn Automation Tools using YOUR OWN Account</a>, to understand that even using some LinkedIn automation tools might danger your LinkedIn account.</p><p><strong>Good news, you can now scrape LinkedIn profiles <em>WITHOUT</em> risking your account with <a href="https://nubela.co/proxycurl/">Proxycurl</a>!</strong> You can read the <a href="https://nubela.co/blog/introducing-proxycurls-linkedin-api/">introduction to Proxycurl's LinkedIn API here</a>. With Proxycurl as a LinkedIn profile API, you can use your generated profile URLs and get all the data you need!

<![CDATA[Is Open Source Even Relevant in Serverless]]>

<p>Open source has been intertwined with enterprise software for more than two decades and, with the increased adoption of cloud computing, the role of open-source software has only been increasing. If we look at the hype around containers, it is completely driven by open source. As <a href="https://talkingserverless.com/serverless/">Serverless</a> gains traction, driven mainly by the higher-level abstractions, the key question in the minds of industry watchers. When the underlying nuts and bolts have limited meaning from the point of view of its end users, does open source have any meaning? Do developers even care about open source?</p>



<p>When cloud computing gained traction, driven by the success of AWS, there were questions about the viability of open-source software. We had open source projects like OpenStack, CloudStack, and Eucalyptus, competing against the Infrastructure as a Service offering from AWS. They failed miserably because the advantage of cloud computing was in the outsourcing of data center capital expenditure and operations. Open-source IaaS software didn’t provide this advantage and all they could offer was better resource utilization and programmatic access to the infrastructure. However, in the early days of cloud computing, the public cloud was not a runaway success among enterprise customers and the hybrid cloud was the path taken by these users.</p>



<p>Even though open source failed in providing an equivalent to AWS EC2, we saw the reverse happening in the PaaS layer. While Heroku, Google App Engine stagnated after getting initial developer mindshare, OSS offerings like OpenShift and CloudFoundry gained developer traction as well as enterprise adoption. Their success could be adopted to the fact that enterprise customers wanted to have a PaaS like abstraction that could span both on-premises as well as public cloud. This was followed by the huge success of Docker as the container engine and Kubernetes as the container orchestration plane. At this point, talking heads were so confident about the importance of OSS in cloud computing. But we need to keep in mind that the success of OSS in the PaaS layer was driven by two main reasons:</p>



<ul><li>PaaS services in the public cloud had a legacy cost structure based on compute units similar to virtual machines</li><li>Hybrid cloud was still the focus of enterprise customers due to unnecessary concerns about moving to public cloud providers</li></ul>



<p>In the last 2-3 years, we have seen a dramatic shift in the enterprise adoption of public clouds and most organizations are taking a cloud-first approach.</p>



<p>So, when AWS released AWS Lambda with a new pricing model based on service invocations, we saw a shift similar in importance to what happened when they released compute and storage as a service with a pricing model where user paid only when the service was used. Functions as a Service (FaaS) like AWS Lambda, <a href="https://go.zoho.com/yIl">Catalyst</a>, Azure Functions, etc. provide a breakthrough in the cost model similar to the pay per use model unleashed by early cloud services like AWS S3 and EC2. This is what makes FaaS uniquely attractive to both developers and enterprises. A fundamental shift in a cost structure that lowers the barrier to adoption and the cost of innovation. FaaS levels the playing field for smaller companies to build innovative services to compete with large organizations with great financial muscle. This is entirely driven by the cost model of FaaS alone and the cost savings are the reason why FaaS is still attractive in spite of certain architectural limitations imposed by the abstraction.</p>



<p>The key question is whether open-source can compete with FaaS offerings in the cloud. There is no straightforward binary answer and it is a bit more nuanced. OSS cannot compete head to head with FaaS. Developers would rather not have any operational overhead than managing the open-source serverless layer. FaaS is a clear winner against open source equivalents just like how IaaS made open-source cloud infrastructure software irrelevant. However, open-source may still be important in some niche areas:</p>



<ul><li>There could be higher-order developer frameworks on top of FaaS that could be open source in order to get developer mindshare. Serverless.com is a good example of this</li><li>Multi-cloud is fast becoming the de facto strategy for many organizations. Organizations may want to provide the same developer abstractions across multiple cloud providers. Open source serverless platforms will be relevant in this scenario. Data is spread out among multiple cloud providers and the compute for the applications using the data should lie closer to the data. Many organizations may want to provide a standardized developer interface to their developers. Open source serverless platforms will be useful in such scenarios. This is similar to the success of OpenShift and, to a lesser extent, CloudFoundry in the PaaS layer</li><li>Kubernetes is fast gaining traction among the enterprises for deploying containers. As organizations deploy apps using multiple encapsulations and deployment models like containers and FaaS, they may want to have a Kubernetes based serverless layer. Knative and serverless frameworks on top of Knative may be relevant in such scenarios</li></ul>



<p>While it doesn’t make sense to use an open-source FaaS layer while using a single cloud provider for deploying the applications, it may still be relevant in multi-cloud scenarios and toolkits around FaaS. Thoughts?</p>

<p>– None of your ancestors ever needed it.</p>



<p> – It’s new, so there haven’t been any studies on the long-term risks.</p>



<p> – The rich will have more of it than the poor, which contributes to inequality.</p>



<p> – Whites will have more of it than blacks, which contributes to racism.</p>



<p> – The inventors might get rich, even though the world has many hard-working, poor people. That’s not fair.</p>



<p> – Someone who doesn’t want it might be pressured into using it, and that would impinge on personal freedom.</p>



<p> – If it doesn’t save labor, it’s frivolous; if it does save labor, it will put people out of work.</p>



<p> – What if criminals, dictators, or other bad actors used it for evil purposes?</p>



<p> – People are used to the old way of doing things, and why should they have to change?</p>



<p> – It needs to be tested more thoroughly.</p>



<p> – Not having to do things the hard way will make everyone lazy.</p>



<p> – It’s not perfect, and it won’t solve all of our problems.</p>



<p> – Nobody would really want it anyway.</p>



<p> – The whole idea is just ridiculous.</p>
