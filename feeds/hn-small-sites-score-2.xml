<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-5563" role="main"><div><div><div><p>A <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4381" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new study has found</a> that elderly patients who underwent emergency surgery on their surgeon’s birthday had significantly higher 30-day mortality rates than patients whose surgery took place on any other day of the year. <span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p><p>The 30-day mortality rate (defined as death within 30 days after surgery)&nbsp;for the “surgeon’s birthday” group was 6.9%. This was 23% higher than the 5.6% rate for the “other day” group.</p><p>The study, which appears today in the <em>British Medical Journal</em> (<a href="https://www.bmj.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BMJ</a>),&nbsp;looked at 980,876 procedures performed in US hospitals by 47,489 surgeons.&nbsp;Of those procedures, 2,064 (0.2%) took place on a surgeon’s birthday.&nbsp;The patients were all Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 to 99. They had all undergone one of 17 common emergency surgical procedures between 2011 and 2014.</p><h2>Distractions during the most common emergency surgery types</h2><p>Examples of those 17 procedures included cardiovascular surgeries, hip and femur fracture, appendectomy, and small bowel resection. The study focused on&nbsp;emergency surgery, so as to&nbsp;minimize the potential selection bias. For example, surgeons might otherwise choose patients based on their illness severity, or patients might choose their surgeon.</p><p>As the authors write, “The effect size of surgeons’ birthday observed in our analysis (1.3 percentage point increase or a 23% increase in mortality), though substantial, is comparable to the impact of other events, including holidays (e.g., Christmas and New Year) and weekends.” <span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><p>In fact, the <a href="https://amzn.to/3m5rimG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">history of surgery</a> has often demonstrated that external factors can influence surgical outcomes. The authors refer to a 2014 study showing that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23345314/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patients admitted to Scottish emergency rooms on&nbsp;public holidays had a 27% increase</a> in 30-day mortality.&nbsp;Other research has found, for example,&nbsp;that doctors are more likely to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1910546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prescribe antibiotics</a> and <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2749268" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opioids</a> — and <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2733171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less likely to order&nbsp;cancer screening tests</a> — as the workday progresses. This is most likely because the “cumulative cognitive demand” of such decisions gradually takes its toll.&nbsp;</p><p>Research on judges has yielded similar results. It has found, for example, that external factors as diverse as outdoor temperatures and sports results can influence judges’ decisions.&nbsp;</p><h2>A natural experiment: ER surgery on the doctor’s birthday</h2><p>But the authors say the “natural experiment” in the present study is more revealing than, for example, holiday-related mortality rates. That is because “those events not only affect physicians’ performance but also influence patients’ decision to seek care (i.e., patients seeking care on these special days might be sicker than those seeking care on other days), as well as hospital staffing.” Unless, of course, the patients know their surgeon’s birthday, which is unlikely (though that may change if this study becomes widely known).&nbsp;</p><p>The 1.3% effect size was the result after a very through series of controls. These included, for example, excluding those surgeons with the highest patient mortality rates. Other controls included assigning a random “pseudo-birthday” to surgeons to see whether the results still held up, or checking whether the surgeon did an above-average number of procedures on their birthday. <span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-box-4"></span></p><p>Likewise, the researchers controlled for “milestone” birthdays (such as 40 or 50). They also controlled for whether a birthday fell on a Friday, which might make after-work birthday festivities more likely.&nbsp;Their findings also held up when the analysis was restricted to procedures with the highest average mortality, or to only the most ill patients.&nbsp;In fact, without these adjustments, the 30-day mortality rate difference between the birthday and non-birthday groups (the unadjusted rate) was even higher (7.0% vs. 5.6%, or a 1.4% difference).</p><h2><strong>Why</strong> does emergency surgery suffer on surgeon’s birthday?</h2><p>The authors propose a few potential explanations for this “birthday effect.”&nbsp;</p><p>These include hurrying through an emergency surgery to be on time for after-work birthday events; <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/study-finds-users-not-notifications-initiate-89-of-smartphone-interactions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">distracting</a> birthday-related phone calls or text messages; more conversations with well-wishing staff members; and a decreased likelihood to go back to the hospital that evening if a patient’s condition deteriorates.</p><p>They also found that some surgeons did not work on their birthdays. While 2,144 surgeons in this study performed procedures one day before their birthday, and 2,027 did so one day after their birthday, only 1,805 surgeons carried out procedures on their actual birthday. This does not affect the results of the study’s analyses. But it does suggest “that birthdays are an important enough factor for some surgeons to choose not to operate on that day, which supports the credibility of our assumption that a birthday could be a distracting factor for those surgeons who choose to operate on that day,” the authors write.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Limitations</strong> <strong>and future directions</strong></h2><p>The researchers emphasized that this study focused on common procedures, and on older Medicare patients. This means that the findings may not apply to other types of patients, or to other surgical procedures.</p><p>Still, the authors write, these results may lead to “additional support for surgeons who have potentially distracting events,” such as birthdays, “to make sure that patients receive high quality surgical care regardless of when undergo surgery.”</p><hr><p><strong>Study: </strong>“<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m4381" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patient mortality after surgery on the surgeon’s birthday: observational study</a>“<br><strong>Authors:</strong> Hirotaka Kato, Anupam B.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>Remember when we used to joke around, debate about politics, have a drink afterwards and hug your  friend with a  different political view. Remember when we would switch on the news and just casually criticize whatever dumb shit both the  political parties were doing. Ahh those were the days.</p>
<p>Remember when we used to hug our friends with a slightly different political view than us. Remember when we switch on the news and make fun of whatever dumb shit those politicians were pulling of. Remember when opinions were objective and not personal.</p>
<p>Now everyone and their grandmother has a political opinion that is so well formed, so true,  that neither of them is going to entertain any counter argument. I have seen decade old friendships end, careers destroyed, families torn apart because of differing political opinions.</p>
<p>We do have faint memories  of  a time before this, where everyone didn’t make everything a part of their identity. Where you could have a reasonable discussion with someone without it ending in a fist fight. Those times are long gone, but how the hell did we arrive here.</p>

<p>There is point on the slope where shit goes downhill, and for us it was that point when Social Media appeared. Social Media in all it’s glorious forms aren’t  inherently bad, it’s when you add big data magic and billions of dollars of advertisement budget to the mix that messes everything up. Suddenly  the thing  that you use to keep tabs of your friends and family, start to keep tabs on you.</p>
<p>Advertisement has always been about attention, that’s why big billboards are lit up in the middle of the  night showing scantily clad women with legs pointing to some shit your won’t need. The sole purpose is to turn your head and to make you take notice. They don’t care who sees it, they just care a lot of us do.</p>
<p>A lot of advertisement on the early days of the internet were similar, they would put banner ads on the  most busiest sites hoping to gather the most eyeballs. It worked  like that for some time  until they  realized rather than billboards  on the side of the  road,  you could target your users. Rather than  advertising on a generic forum about the world, you could advertise on a blog about cars for your new useless engine oil. The people who would be visiting the car blog would probably be the ones who would be most interested in buying your shitty snake oil. Hence targeting was born. The ROI of Internet advertisement skyrocketed, and everyone wanted a piece of the pie.</p>
<p>Then Social Media came along with a totally different game. They started  to  track your each and every move  building up intricate profiles of you neatly kept on an offshore data-center, opening up an even better gold mine for those sleazy salesmen. Rather than waiting for someone to show up for that stupid  blog post  about that broken down car, they could put the ad for the snake oil right in the feed of a person who loves clicking on car pictures. It was all christmas  in ad town from  then on, and the companies  who had the best  tracking profiles  started swimming in money, and the ones who didn’t started dying out. (Too far ? yeah too far)</p>
<p>After spending a couple of billions and tracking every sneeze and every turn of everyone  who ever set foot in their world,  they started to  realize some thing else. The people who bought the snake oil on the first impression was not the normal person who kind  of loved cars, but the obsessed ones who believed that snake oil was the best oil in the  world and that the best way to save the world was to buy more snake oil. Those were the people that had the most ROI ever, and  the people who wore nice suits in big office buildings decided they wanted more of these obsessed fanatics, and Big Social gladly served them up on a plate.</p>
<p>But even in a large  enough population pool  the people who are obsessed about a lot of shit is really hard to find, and to keep the money flowing they needed more of them. So they did what anyone with a degree in Operations would do, they started manufacturing them.</p>
<p>Big Social realized that the people who  engage  most, who  drive the most revenue are the ones obsessed with the content. They are the most  revenue generating cattle of the ranch, and since everything is a numbers game they started to maximize obsessiveness. Well how do you manufacture people who would die for their views ? How do you manufacture obsessiveness ? Bubbles.</p>
<h2 id="enter-bubbles">Enter Bubbles</h2>
<p>The more the number of positive reinforcement that a person receives about their already existing viewpoints and the more number  of negative reinforcements they see around the opposing ones, the more likely they are to believe their beliefs are true. The more they are engrossed in their bubbles the more they are susceptible to being obsessed.</p>
<p>The  first  time we sign-up for it, they don’t know anything about us. So they ask us for our interests and to add our closest friends. Based on that they show us some generic content  based on our and  our friends interests. Then we start interacting with them, each and every interaction, each and  every pause is recorded and measured and converted  to a  data point. Initially the content is neutral, leaning just to the side  of our interests and our beliefs. The more we interact with it, the more the virtual  profile of ourselves get optimized. With our likes and shares and comments  we build an echo chamber around ourselves, with help from a  black box algorithm designed to optimize  for obsessiveness.</p>
<p>But an echo chamber doesn’t make you and obsessed radical, what makes you one is shock.</p>
<h2 id="enter-shock">Enter Shock</h2>
<p>Shock is what pushes your towards the edge of obsessiveness. Content that has high shock value are borderline impossible to believe. They rock your belief system and lingers on the edge of possibility. It’s purpose is not to make you believe the content right away, but to expand and reinforce your viewpoint so much so that you believe a little more polarized content than what you are used to. That is how you manufacture obsessiveness, that’s how your manufacture  polarization. The cycle is repeated indefinitely nudging you little by little to the edge, until you fall  o ver. Is  it  intentional or  a  byproduct  of an algorithm optimized for profit and engagement maximization is up for debate.</p>
<p>Consider me and Youtube. Like every teenager I had trouble with the ladies and like any other teenager I turned  to the internet for help. I started with dating videos, content which I  was looking for. Then slowly my recommended feed stared to show just one or two videos on how women were the problem of modern society, not enough to turn me to a believer but just enough to shock me. Having been exposed to that I started to normalize videos that bash feminism, SJW’s being owned and rants about how women are the problem. Then my feed started to get populated with  even more  anti-women and videos around red-pill and the manosphere. I am not saying these viewpoints are right or  wrong, but they were shocking  and normalized  a lot  of stuff that I would never have accepted if I was shown then from the start. After a while I started believing a lot of the what was being said, I was starting to suffocate in my own bubble. Luckily I used to read a lot outside the internet and hence had access to contrasting view points. That’s when I realized how deep in the rabbit hole I was. This prompted me to seek out alternate viewpoints and form my own opinions.  If I had kept going I would most probably have turned  into an angry fanatic thirsty for blood on the internet, shouting on some obscure forum on the edge of the internet.</p>
<p>That’s what  the algorithms are designed to do. They have the maximum engagement and attention from how obsessed their users  are. For being obsessed it’s not only vital that you  push the view point forward but also to demean and dehumanize the opposing one, so much so to the point that you believe the views that they hold are clearly wrong.  It pushes us into an us vs them mentality, where we are on right ones  and they are the wrong ones.</p>
<p>After a while we start to internalize what we interact with, it becomes a part of your identity.You start to believe the extreme content that you are exposed to as your own, you start to defend it with all your might.  You can’t entertain an  argument  because it is no  longer an argument  against your opinion,but one against  your identity. To entertain any argument is to acknowledge you are wrong and to prove everything you have interacted with for a long time to be wrong. This is  what  polarizes  us, this is what makes having a friendly conversation about opposing  views impossible in this  day and age. This is what is being done to us. We are divided  by opinions cocooned in our own bubbles, our own  echo chambers which enforce our beliefs and makes us immune to any counter  argument no matter how right or wrong.</p>
<h2 id="breaking-out">Breaking Out</h2>
<p>It’s not easy and fun getting out once you are inside. It’s like the matrix you see and hear and interact with an artificial world designed to hook you in, and like Neo it’s one hell of a ride to unplug. It’s hard but it’s possible, this is how I  did it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear the data that they have on you, take away the data and take away the power.</li>
<li>Humanize the opposing view points and the people who make  them. Realize they too have a valid point and that they believe it enough to defend it with all their heart.</li>
<li>Seek out alternate view points, it’s kind of a fun exercise. When you start everything looks stupid and dumb, persist and after a while you will feel a switch inside your brain, when you realize they also have a valid point.</li>
<li>Take some time off and  think deeply about everything and put together a version of the reality and form your own opinions based on them.</li>
<li>Refine those opinions  as you learn more about reality.</li>
</ul>
<p>OR</p>
<ul>
<li>Logout of all your Social Media, it’s not that useful anyway</li>
<li>Get a Flip Phone,  looks cooler than  a dumb phone</li>
<li>Life life  as  nature …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>You might recall that my Twitter account was <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/16/i-lost-my-twitter-account/" data-type="post" data-id="15196">hijacked</a> and then <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/12/03/twitter-lockout-again/" data-type="post" data-id="15287">again</a> just two weeks later.</p>



<h2>The first: brute-force</h2>



<p>The  first take-over was most likely a case of brute-forcing my weak password while not having 2FA enabled. I have no excuse for either of those lapses. I had convinced myself I had 2fa enabled which made me take a (too) lax attitude to my short 8-character password that was possible to remember. Clearly, 2fa was not enabled and then the only remaining wall against the evil world was that weak password.</p>



<h2>The second time</h2>



<p>After that first hijack, I immediately changed password to a strong many-character one and I made really sure I enabled 2fa with an authenticator app and I felt safe again. Yet it would only take seventeen days until I <em><strong>again</strong></em> was locked out from my account. This second time, I could see how <em>someone had managed to change the email address</em> associated with my account (displayed when I wanted to reset my password). With the password not working and the account not having the correct email address anymore, I could not reset the password, and my 2fa status had no effect. I was locked out. Again.</p>



<p>It felt related to the first case because I’ve had my Twitter account since May 2008. I had never lost it before and then suddenly after 12+ years, within a period of three weeks, it happens twice?</p>



<h2>Why and how</h2>



<p>How this happened was a complete mystery to me. The account was restored fairly swiftly but I learned nothing from that.</p>



<p>Then someone at Twitter contacted me. After they investigated what had happened and how, I had a chat with a responsible person there and he explained for me exactly how this went down.</p>



<p>Had Twitter been hacked? Is there a way to circumvent 2FA? Were my local computer or phone compromised? No, no and no.</p>



<p>Apparently, an agent at Twitter who were going through the backlog of issues, where my previous hijack issue was still present, accidentally changed the email on my account by mistake, probably confusing it with another account in another browser tab.</p>



<p><strong>There was no outside intruder, it was just a user error.</strong></p>



<p>Okay, the cynics will say, this is what he <em>told</em> me and there is no evidence to back it up. That’s right, I’m taking his words as truth here but I also think the description matches my observations. There’s just no way for me or any outsider to verify or fact-check this.</p>



<h2>A brighter future</h2>



<p>They seem to already have identified things to improve to reduce the risk of this happening again and Michael also mentioned a few other items on their agenda that should make hijacks harder to do and help them detect suspicious behavior earlier and faster going forward. I was also happy to provide my feedback on how I think they could’ve made my lost-account experience a little better.</p>



<p>I’m relieved that the second time at least wasn’t my fault and neither of my systems are breached  or hacked (as far as I know).</p>



<p>I’ve also now properly and thoroughly gone over all my accounts on practically all online services I use and made really sure that I have 2fa enabled on them. On some of them I’ve also changed my registered email address to one with 30 random letters to make it truly impossible for any outsider to guess what I use.</p>



<p>(I’m also positively surprised by this extra level of customer care Twitter showed for me and my case.)</p>



<h2>Am I a target?</h2>



<p>I don’t think I am. I think maybe my Twitter account could be interesting to scammers since I have almost 25K followers and I have a verified account. Me personally, I work primarily with open source and most of my works is already made public. I don’t deal in business secrets. I don’t think my personal stuff attracts attackers more than anyone else does.</p>

<p>What about the risk or the temptation for bad guys in trying to backdoor curl? It is after all installed in some 10 <em>billion</em> systems world-wide. I’ve <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2017/09/12/the-backdoor-threat/">elaborated on that before</a>. Summary: I think it is terribly hard for someone to actually manage to do it. Not because of the security of my personal systems perhaps, but because of the entire setup and all processes, signings, reviews, testing and scanning that are involved.</p>



<p>So no. I don’t think my personal systems are a valued singled out target to attackers.</p>



<p>Now, back to work!</p>

December 15, 2020 | https://applieddivinitystudies.com/handcuffs-empirical/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://applieddivinitystudies.com/handcuffs-empirical/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p><a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/handcuffs/">Last post</a>, I argued against common explanations for Golden Handcuffs.</p>
<p>Before we dive deeper, it’s worth asking, are they even real? Are employees of elite companies actually pathologically unable to leave? Is it just a stereotype with no grounding in reality?</p>
<p>Here are a variety of attempts to estimate the Golden Handcuffs effect empirically.</p>
<h3 id="YC-Founders-Join-Elite-Universities-but-Not-Elite-Companies"><a href="#YC-Founders-Join-Elite-Universities-but-Not-Elite-Companies" title="YC Founders Join Elite Universities, but Not Elite Companies"></a>YC Founders Join Elite Universities, but Not Elite Companies</h3><p>Rather than examining the psychology of employees, let’s just work backwards and count how many founders have big company experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/wilbin-rationalists/">A while back</a>, I published a dataset of the top Y Combinator founders and noticed something odd.</p>
<p>Of the 26 founders, only 1 had held a full-time role at a FAANG company. [2] Two others had worked at Facebook, but only as interns. Outside of FAANG, only 3 founders had worked at companies I recognized at all. [3]</p>
<p>One explanation is the founder-as-monomaniacal-hero. Founders are totally single minded in their devotion, and would never do something as stupid as get sidetracked by prestige or status.</p>
<p>Except that they absolutely do. Of the 26 founders, 21 attended elite universities, mostly MIT and Stanford [1]. So maybe those universities are just incredibly good at fostering entrepreneurs, but more likely, they’re just good at attracting and selecting them. I take this as evidence that founders are not allergic to jumping through conventional hoops, pursuing instrumental goods, sitting down to take the SAT and so on.</p>
<p>It gets weirder when you consider population sizes. Google has around 100,000 employees, whereas MIT and Stanford undergrad programs are just 11,500 combined! And since average tenure at Google is under 4 years, each unit of headcount produces more alumni than a full degree program. [4]</p>
<p>All else equal, we should expect to sample many more founders from Google than from elite universities, but this doesn’t seem to be the case.</p>
<p>What’s going on?</p>
<h3 id="Golden-Handcuffs-as-Selection-Effects"><a href="#Golden-Handcuffs-as-Selection-Effects" title="Golden Handcuffs as Selection Effects"></a>Golden Handcuffs as Selection Effects</h3><p>One explanation is that there are no golden handcuffs and it’s all selection effects. The kinds of people who work for Google are the ones who never intended to leave in the first place. The kinds of people who want to start great companies don’t have any interest in working for somebody else.</p>
<p>This is a reasonable explanation, but applies to less than half of the founders I looked at.</p>
<p>Only 11 of the 26 founders started a company right out of school. 14 have confirmed work experience, and another 2 have scrubbed the employment history, but have long gaps between graduating from school and founding their company.</p>
<p>Maybe working for a small startup shows that you’re less risk averse than a Google employee, but I don’t totally buy this. Brandon Leonardo (Instacart) worked at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/webs/">Webs</a>, a company I’ve never heard of that claims to make “small business marketing simple”. Dan Kan (Cruise) worked at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/uservoice/">UserVoice</a>, “the leading product feedback management software”. What exactly do these experiences select for?</p>
<p>In contrast, if you do want to start a company, working at Google seems like a great first step! You can meet co-founders and potential early employees, save money to fund yourself, gain legitimacy for investors and so on.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s possible the kinds of people who think about “gaining legitimacy for investors” are not going to start great companies. Maybe “real founders” don’t pursue instrumental goods.</p>
<h3 id="A-Third-Perspective-Ex-Google-Founded-Companies"><a href="#A-Third-Perspective-Ex-Google-Founded-Companies" title="A Third Perspective: Ex-Google Founded Companies"></a>A Third Perspective: Ex-Google Founded Companies</h3><p>We’ve been dancing around the issue, but why not just go straight to the source and look at outcomes for the population we care about?</p>
<p>Are Google employees actually bad at starting companies?</p>
<p>Looking directly at startups founded by ex-Google employees valued over a billion dollars, we get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nutanix $5.8B</li>
<li>Cohesity $2.5B</li>
<li>Asana $4.3B</li>
<li>Lucidchart $1B+</li>
<li>Rubrik $3.3B</li>
<li>Instagram (sold for $1B, valued at $100B in 2018)</li>
<li>Pinterest $43B</li>
<li>Flatiron Health $1.9B</li>
<li>Xiaomi $46B</li>
<li>Affirm $2.9B</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s a super impressive list! It doesn’t seem like ex-Google employees are bad at starting companies and pathologically incapable of quitting their jobs. Instead, the oddity is merely that they don’t attend Y Combinator.</p>
<p>That’s a different skew, and much easier to explain. Unlike regular YC founders, ex-Google employees may just be:</p>
<ul>
<li>So wealthy that they self-fund until they can raise a Series A and aren’t willing to sell 7% of their company for $125k.</li>
<li>So tired of bureaucracy that they refuse to join an accelerator.</li>
<li>So credentialed that they don’t feel a need to go through Y Combinator to gain further credibility.</li>
<li>So well connected that they raise a Series A without going through Y Combinator.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever the explanation, the fact remains that ex-Google employees do in fact leave to start companies.</p>
<h3 id="Adjustments-and-Proportionality"><a href="#Adjustments-and-Proportionality" title="Adjustments and Proportionality"></a>Adjustments and Proportionality</h3><p>Of course, we now have to ask if they do so proportionally. Even if Google has produced the founders of nearly a dozen billion dollar companies, we shouldn’t be impressed until we’re confident that they’re actually hitting above their weight.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unicorn_startup_companies">Wikipedia lists</a> 495 startups worth over a billion dollars, putting Google at 2%. But if you only include US based startups, Google is at 9 out of 122, or 7%.</p>
<p>To figure out the appropriate reference class, we’ll start with the number of software engineers in the US (4 million), then identify how many ex-Google employees there were 10 years ago when most of these founders started their companies.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/gabor/timeline-employee-count-growth-for-microsoft-yahoo-google-and-facebook-9ede22a37824">A partner at google</a> has compiled and released <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L0M0u0-C_LoFrGLw0H-9nkgN9wqUhl4bUTcVI0fDZuU/edit#gid=793191479">historical headcount data</a>. This is a good starting point, but remember that we’re actually interested in the total alumni population rathern than point-in-time headcount.</p>
<p>To make this estimate, I assume 3 year average tenure and run a simplified simulation where 33% of the workforce quits at the end of each year, then Google rehires up to next year’s headcount. </p>
<p>Running this simulation from 2000 to 2010, we get that there were 50,000 ex-Google employees in 2010. They’ve <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-software-engineers-does-Google-have">previously said the workforce is 40% technical</a>, so that’s equivalent to 20,000 engineers. [5]</p>
<p>Pitting that against the 4 million software engineers in the US [6], we get that ex-Google engineers were around 0.5% of the relevant population, but started 7% of the US based billion dollar startups. That’s a mulitple of 14x, and fairly good evidence that Google employees are not particularly bad at starting companies. [7]</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Taking a step back, recall that what we’re actually curious about is not whether Google engineers are disproportionately successful at starting companies, but whether they even try in the first place. In other words, do they appear irrationally bound by Golden Handcuffs?</p>
<p>Compared to a randomly selected US based engineer, Google engineers have all sorts of benefits. They’re well credentialed, well connected, largely based in Silicon Valley, and supposedly smarter than average.</p>
<p>It’s entirely possible that their success rate is 140x that of a typical engineer, but they only try one tenth as often. The fact that Google engineers start successful companies doesn’t preclude the possibility that Golden Handcuffs are holding them back.</p>
<p>Further, consider that “rationality” in this case is really a function of both odds of success and opportunity cost. Even if Google engineers are less likely to start companies, it could be a perfectly reasonable choice given their relatively high opportunity cost.</p>
<p>So at the end of the day, the empirical data tells us a few interesting things, but can’t present a decisive conclusion.</p>
<hr>
<p>[1] The other universities I count as “elite” are:</p>
<ul>
<li>RISD</li>
<li>Joint RISD/MIT</li>
<li>2 x Harvard</li>
<li>University of Waterloo</li>
<li>Berkeley, Columbia MBA</li>
</ul>
<p>The ones I don’t include are:</p>
<ul>
<li>USD</li>
<li>San Jose State University</li>
<li>Rice</li>
<li>Duke</li>
<li>Claremont McKenna College</li>
</ul>
<p>I do include 4 founders who attended Stanford for grad school, but did not attend an elite undergraduate institution.</p>
<p>[2] Apoorva Mehta of Instacart spent 2 years at Amazon.</p>
<p>[3] Tony Xu of DoorDash was an intern at Square, and worked full time at McKinsey for 2 years, and eBay for another 2. Fred Ehrsam of Coinbase had spent 2 years at Goldman Sachs. Brian Armstrong of same had interned at IBM and Deloitte, then spent a year at Airbnb. Though notably, this was in May 2011, back when Airbnb was a small Series A startup with under $10 million in total funding.</p>
<p>[4] This ends up being a bit complicated. Reportedly, Google has an average tenure of 3.2 years with a median of 1.1. This is possible, but odd, and I’m not sure how they got these numbers. It’s tricky because at any given time, some population of employees has not left and you don’t know how long they’ll stay. If you count their tenure as their tenure-to-date, you’re undercounting how long they’ll actually end up staying. If you only count employees who have left, you’re skewed toward employees with short tenure. Also, Google has grown over the years, and we’re looking at founders who are successful now but started out 10 years ago when Google was around 25,000 employees.</p>
<p>[5] Data <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FeDDGo_SWeDMMZlTrJ_P2TifyJoOqAuOD8klBKQpUdA/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. And yes, it’s possible the proportion of engineers has changed over time and this analysis is off.</p>
<p>This also helps explain why there are relatively so many founders from top universities. In the same 10 year time span, Stanford and MIT undergrad graduated around 115,000 alumni.</p>
<p>[6] Maybe we should be looking at the number of people who have been software engineers from 2000 to 2010 including retirements, and this number is actually higher. Assuming 40 year careers, and a constantly total number of engineers, it should be something like 25% higher, and Google is proportionately 25% better than it appears in the main text.</p>
<p>[7] There are lots of over corrections you could apply here, so don’t take this too literally. Maybe the relevant population is all people, not just engineers. In that case, Google ends up looking way better since the general population is much less than 40% engineers. </p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>This article is the result of my latest obsession with software virtualization. After years of just skipping virtualized routines, I was finally inspired by <a href="https://blog.can.ac/" target="_blank">Can</a> and started work on this complex topic. What ensued was months of reverse engineering, functional programming, and a LOT of learning. Now that I finally feel comfortable publishing some information on the things I learned in the process, I present unto you the first installment in my devirtualization series, focusing on how virtualization works and the methodology of how we can lift a VM. The aim of this series is to tear down the curtains behind virtualization and hopefully inspire more reverse engineers to research this interesting topic!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>Over the last 10 years or so, virtualization based obfuscation has become the de-facto standard in defensive and offensive software alike. As the complexity and power of disassembling tools has improved, software security solutions have kept up rather well. Packers and code mutation tools, being easily defeated by even newbie attackers, have been replaced by these virtual machine based protectors. Today, the two main ‘pioneers’ in this field, controlling the vast majority of the market are <a href="https://vmpsoft.com/" target="_blank">VMProtect</a> and <a href="https://www.oreans.com/" target="_blank">Themida</a>. While we will be looking into analyzing (and breaking) them specifically in some future articles, today we’ll just be looking into how we can lift <em>any</em> VM into <a href="https://blog.can.ac/" target="_blank">Can</a>’s promising <a href="https://vtil.io/" target="_blank">VTIL</a>.</p>

<h2 id="but-first-what-actually-is-virtualization">But first, what actually is virtualization?</h2>
<p>Virtualization is the <strong>recompilation</strong> of instructions to a <strong>custom proprietary architecture</strong>, and the generation of <strong>handler routines</strong> to emulate said architecture. Let’s look at an example of the life of just one simple instruction, <code>push rcx</code>:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><img src="https://0xnobody.github.io/assets/virtualization-1/vm-flowchart.png" alt="alt text" title="Life of a push rcx instruction"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><em>The mystical adventure <code>push rcx</code> undertakes when you press ‘Protect’</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The <code>push rcx</code> instruction is decoded, and interpreted by the virtualizer. A handler is generated (or fetched, if it has already been generated and is being reused), which is responsible for executing this instruction in a way that the CPU understands. In our example, I called this handler <code>VPUSH</code> just for explanation’s sake, but obviously they don’t come with names attached to them.</p>

<p>Following this, a ‘virtual instruction’ is then assembled, which contains bytes to identify its handler (in this case, just a table offset) and any operands that are needed for execution. You can see in the diagram above, that the bytes corresponding to the instruction’s <strong>handler offset</strong> are in <strong>green</strong>, whereas the ones corresponding to the <strong>operand</strong> (ie. the <strong>target register</strong>) are in <strong>blue</strong>. This is also reflected in the handler with the corresponding colours.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting, that on handler execution, the virtual instruction pointer (VIP) actually points to the beginning of the <strong>blue</strong> operand bytes. This is because the previous handler has to read (and consume) the next handler’s offset in order to pass control over to it.</p>

<p>Anyways, let’s take a closer look at this <code>VPUSH</code> handler:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>movzx</span> <span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>word</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[rbp]</span> 
<span>; - rbp is the virtual instruction pointer (VIP) in this case, which contains the pushed register (blue)</span>
<span>; - the pushed register is fetched and stored in ax. In our case this is 0x30</span>

<span>mov</span> <span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>rsi</span> <span>+</span> <span>rax</span><span>]</span> 
<span>; - rsi is the virtual context; it holds each of the virtual registers. Think of a CONTEXT structure on </span>
<span>; windows.</span>
<span>; - the lower word in rax holds the register offset in the context. The register is fetched from the</span>
<span>; context and stored in rax.</span>

<span>push</span> <span>rax</span>
<span>; - the stored register is pushed to the stack.</span>

<span>movzx</span> <span>rdx</span><span>,</span> <span>word</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rbp</span><span>+</span><span>0x2</span><span>]</span>
<span>mov</span> <span>rdx</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>+</span><span>rdx</span><span>]</span>
<span>; - VIP + 0x2 contains the next handler's offset (green). It is fetched and stored in rdx</span>
<span>; - rdi is the handler table base. The next handler is fetched by offseting it by rdx and storing the</span>
<span>; handler address</span>

<span>add</span> <span>rbp</span><span>,</span> <span>0x4</span>
<span>; - the instruction pointer is incremented by the size of bytes consumed</span>

<span>jmp</span> <span>rdx</span>
<span>; - jump to the next handler, held by rdx, to execute the next instruction's handler</span>
<span>; - the execution loop continues...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Virtual machines are basically just very <strong>very</strong> long chains of these handlers, each doing quite rudimentary operations.
It must be said, however, that the example I gave above is an extremely simple one. Modern virtualizers have integrated encryption and obfuscation techniques, and some feature quite advanced custom architectures. Many stray far away from the x86 instruction set to make the analyst’s life harder.</p>

<p>Well, how does this impact analysis, you ask? Well, since you’re reading this article, you must already know ;)
But to name a few:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The original instructions are lost, forever. Only the behaviour is retained, in a proprietary, usually randomized architecture. For example, even after full devirtualization, we can’t for 100% say that the original register used for the push is <code>rcx</code>.</li>
  <li>The VM’s architecture can differ significantly from the original. For example, a single VM instruction could push 3 registers, exchange 2 registers, and write to one register. All in a <em>single</em> virtual instruction!</li>
  <li>Other obfuscation techniques (such as mutation) can now be applied on both the host level (real x86 instructions executing on the PC) and on the guest level (the virtual instructions represented by the handlers).</li>
  <li>Control flow is in most cases highly obscured. Often conditional jumps are manually emulated. This makes tracking basic blocks difficult.</li>
  <li>The VM cannot be statically analyzed in tools like IDA, as it does not function like a conventional program.</li>
</ul>

<p>Needless to say, virtualization is an extremely powerful and effective software protection method.</p>

<h2 id="lets-break-it">Let’s break it!</h2>
<p>In order to break and reverse this protection, we really just need to do three things: gather information in order to determine exactly what each handler does in which order, somehow convert this information into a language that the CPU and disassemblers understand (in our case, x86), and then finally repackage the binary.
This is called <em>lifting</em>, <em>translation</em>, and <em>repackaging</em> respectively, and it is what needs to be done to devirtualize any VM.
Today, we’re just gonna be looking at <em>lifting</em> in particular.</p>

<h2 id="lifting">Lifting</h2>
<p>The dictionary definition for lifting is “raise to a higher position or level”. This is entirely true. We are performing analyis on the virtual routines, in order to determine what each handler does on the instruction level, and then converting this information into a higher level, easy-to-understand representation. This is done in a few steps.</p>

<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><img src="https://0xnobody.github.io/assets/virtualization-1/virt-starter-pack.png" alt="alt text" title="Ha ha xd"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><em>After analyzing VMs for a few hours (or days), you do begin to notice certain things.</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Before we can perform any handler analysis, we must first be able to navigate our way around the VM. Although this step varies greatly for each VM, certain parts always remain the same.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Every VM routine must begin by saving the value of each register, usually by pushing them to the stack. This is done because the VM needs to use the registers to run its handlers, and it must restore the registers after exiting the VM.</li>
  <li>Each VM must also have some sort of context structure. This is where current executing information about the VM is held, such as register values. It can easily be identified as it is accessed very often in every handler.</li>
  <li>Each VM must have an instruction pointer (VIP) used to determine which handler to execute next and to provide that handler with operands. It is also easy to identify, as it much be adjusted after each handler.</li>
  <li>Many VMs have some sort of stack representation. For example, VMProtect uses a nominated register to access the stack, whereas Themida just uses RSP.</li>
  <li>Code flow must somehow be passed from one handler to the next. This can just be an index in a handler table, an offset to some point in the code, or something entirely different. It is worth noting that the next handler <em>must</em> be computed from the VIP.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to properly analyze and decode each handler, we must be able to follow the VM’s execution. We must follow the VM’s <em>fetch-&gt;decode-&gt;execute</em> loop, so we are able to determine which handler will be executed next. Once the basics of the VM are reversed and we can step through the handler instructions, the next step is to identify these handlers.</p>

<h3 id="identification">Identification</h3>
<p>Now we need to determine what each handler does. We can achieve this via <em>pattern matching</em> the instructions. Of course, we must remember to keep these patterns balanced, ensuring we match all the relevant instructions but make them generic enough so that we can match with all instances of the handler.</p>

<p><em>Pattern matching</em> is quite a generic method, and can be used in various different flavours alongside many other algorithms depending on the complexity of the VM. But in this example we’re gonna take it easy, and just look at a simple forward matching algorithm. This allows us to specify the patterns we want to match, and the order we want to match them in.</p>

<p>Let’s use the above <code>push</code> handler as an example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// this class contains templates to pattern match against</span>
<span>//</span>
<span>auto</span> <span>matcher</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>pattern_matcher</span><span>(</span><span>stream</span><span>);</span>

<span>x86_reg</span> <span>vcontext_reg</span> <span>=</span> <span>X86_REG_RSI</span><span>;</span>

<span>// these values will be set as the patterns are found</span>
<span>// they allow us to ensure that the same register is used for more than one pattern</span>
<span>// they also allow us to retrieve specific information about the handler eg. operand sizes</span>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Static quantization allows the user to generate quantized integer model that is highly efficient during inference. However, sometimes, even with careful post-training calibration, the model accuracies might be sacrificed to some extent that is not acceptable. If this is the case, post-training calibration is not sufficient to generate a quantized integer model. We would have train the model in a way so that the quantization effect has been taken into account. Quantization aware training is capable of modeling the quantization effect during training.</p>



<p>The mechanism of quantization aware training is simple, it places fake quantization modules, i.e., quantization and dequantization modules, at the places where quantization happens during floating-point model to quantized integer model conversion, to simulate the effects of clamping and rounding brought by integer quantization. The fake quantization modules will also monitor scales and zero points of the weights and activations. Once the quantization aware training is finished, the floating point model could be converted to quantized integer model immediately using the information stored in the fake quantization modules.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to show how to use PyTorch to do quantization aware training. More details about the mathematical foundations of quantization for neural networks could be found in my article <a href="https://leimao.github.io/article/Neural-Networks-Quantization/">â€œQuantization for Neural Networksâ€�</a>.</p>

<h3 id="pytorch-quantization-aware-training">PyTorch Quantization Aware Training</h3>

<p>Unlike TensorFlow 2.3.0 which supports integer quantization using arbitrary bitwidth from 2 to 16, PyTorch 1.7.0 only supports 8-bit integer quantization. The workflow could be as easy as loading a pre-trained floating point model and apply a quantization aware training wrapper. However, without doing layer fusion, sometimes such kind of easy manipulation would not result in good model performances.</p>



<p>In this case, I will also use the ResNet18 from <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html">TorchVision models</a> as an example. All the steps prior, to the quantization aware training steps, including layer fusion and skip connections replacement, are exactly the same as to the ones used in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/PyTorch-Static-Quantization/">â€œPyTorch Static Quantizationâ€�</a>. The source code could also be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/leimao/PyTorch-Quantization-Aware-Training">GitHub</a>.</p>



<p>The quantization aware training steps are also very similar to post-training calibration:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Train a floating point model or load a pre-trained floating point model.</li>
  <li>Move the model to CPU and switch model to training mode.</li>
  <li>Apply layer fusion.</li>
  <li>Switch model to evaluation mode, check if the layer fusion results in correct model, and switch back to training mode.</li>
  <li>Apply <code>torch.quantization.QuantStub()</code> and <code>torch.quantization.QuantStub()</code> to the inputs and outputs, respectively.</li>
  <li>Specify quantization configurations, such as symmetric quantization or asymmetric quantization, etc.</li>
  <li>Prepare quantization model for quantization aware training.</li>
  <li>Move the model to CUDA and run quantization aware training using CUDA.</li>
  <li>Move the model to CPU and convert the quantization aware trained floating point model to quantized integer model.</li>
  <li>[Optional] Verify accuracies and inference performance gain.</li>
  <li>Save the quantized integer model.</li>
</ol>

<p>The quantization aware training script is very similar to the one used in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/PyTorch-Static-Quantization/">â€œPyTorch Static Quantizationâ€�</a>:</p>

<h2>INTRO</h2>



<p>A few years ago, I got the opportunity to architect and code the fire propagation system in Far Cry 2. &nbsp;At that time, &nbsp;it was a gigantic task and it scared the hell out of me. Luckily, it turned out well enough.</p>



<p>With the upcoming Far Cry 3, several people recently asked me how the system worked. I realized that I never took the time to write it down. So, before I forget and also because it might be useful to somebody out there, here’s a high level overview of its inner workings. &nbsp;Pretty programmer art included as a bonus.</p>



<p><em>Disclaimer: Although Far Cry 3 uses the same system I wrote, I was not involved in the project. They may or may not have changed / adapted or modified the algorithms. What I describe below is accurate for Far Cry 2.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<h2>BASE STRUCTURE</h2>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACell1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACell1.jpg 600w, https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACell1-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption>A 2D Grid good for grass fire. &nbsp;Here, a fire cell has 50 hitpoints</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At the core, the fire propagation system is quite simple. Since gameplay is what’s important, we&nbsp;sacrifice some of the realism for fun. The fire propagation in&nbsp;Far Cry 2 &nbsp;(and Far Cry 3) has just enough realism to maintain the player’s&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief">suspension of disbelief</a>,&nbsp;but certainly not enough to get published anytime soon. Because I like to&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">keep things simple</a>, it doesn’t involve any complicated mathematics, physics or fluid dynamics. That has the additional advantage to be fast to simulate and easy to understand.</p>



<p>The secret sauce is an&nbsp;equally spaced grid. It is true for grass, for objects as well as for trees. The only difference is that we use a 2D grid for grass and a 3D grid for objects and trees.</p>



<p>Each cell of the grid has a position in the world, a radius and&nbsp;<strong>hitpoints</strong>. The cells have a plethora of&nbsp;properties, but these three are the bare minimum to propagate fire.</p>



<h2>LIGHT MY FIRE! HOW TO START ONE?</h2>



<p>The game engine tracks all damage done in the game, might it be bullet shots, impacts or fire damage. When a game entity is damaged, it is notified by an event. The damage event includes how much damage was done, what kind it was and what caused it.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the kind of damage was fire based and the entity is flammable, then at least two things happen:</p>



<ul><li>Firstly, the fire grid is dynamically created for the damaged entity. We create them dynamically because we don’t want those grids&nbsp;to exist in the wild for no reasons. That would take memory, disk space, etc, so we create them as we go. But, once created, it remains as long as the game entity exists.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Secondly, we figure out which cell in the grid is closest to the damage source. That cell then takes the damage and its hitpoints are reduced accordingly.</li></ul>



<p>That’s where things get interesting – When a cell has been damaged by fire and has lost all its hitpoints;&nbsp;<strong>it catches fire</strong>.</p>



<p>While burning, the cell becomes a damager itself. It deals damage to its neighbour cells on the grid; cells that share an edge with it. By doing so, it reduces their hitpoints and when in turns these cells have lost all their hitpoints, they catch fire. That’s how the propagation is created.<br></p>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridBiggerFire1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridBiggerFire1.jpg 700w, https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridBiggerFire1-300x220.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"><figcaption>Fire propagating from left to right. The cells on the fire front are being damaged.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Lastly, a cell from the grid as a finite lifetime. Otherwise, it would burn forever. It can be seen as the amount of energy given by the material that is burning. &nbsp;For instance,&nbsp;a piece of paper would most likely burn faster than a wood log, so it would be given a shorter lifetime value.</p>



<p>That’s it. A fully functional fire propagation system good enough for a AAA game!</p>



<h2>TECHNICALITIES</h2>



<p><strong>Simulate wet jungle VS dry patch of grass</strong><br>How to simulate a wet jungle versus a dry patch of grass? They behave differently. Quite easily!<br>Increase the fire cell’s hitpoints and it’s difficult to set it on fire and it’s slow to propagate.&nbsp;Decrease its burning lifetime and the fire dies out quickly. There, you just simulated a wet jungle environment.</p>



<p><strong>How to create the propagation grids</strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Grass / Land</em></strong><br>For grass wildfire, &nbsp;an axis-aligned 2D grid is built in realtime and projected on a 3D terrain. For each of the cell, we take care to determine if the cell position is underwater, or under an object such as a rock or a building. In which case, we disable that cell and it can no longer catch fire. We wouldn’t want to have fire propagating under rock, would we?<br></p>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridDisabled.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridDisabled.jpg 512w, https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridDisabled-300x220.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"><figcaption>2D grid projected on a terrain. The cells under the rock are disabled.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong><em>Objects</em></strong><br>For objects, it’s a little bit more complicated. First, we create an&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounding_volume">AABB</a>&nbsp;that entirely surrounds the object. &nbsp;Second, we somehow&nbsp;need to detect the shape of that object. After all, it could be a chair, an oil barrel or a whole house for all we know. To accomplish that, the &nbsp;bounding box is divided in equally spaced cubes.&nbsp;The size of each cube depends of the object size, the number of fire emitter we want to have, performance, memory, etc.</p>



<p>An iterative algorithm then go through all those cubes and test their location against the collision shape of the object.&nbsp;If the test return a positive result, this cube is kept, otherwise it is discarded. At the end, we have a collection of cubes that approximately&nbsp;represent the shape of the object to be burned. That’s our propagation grid.<br></p>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3DGrid.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3DGrid.jpg 800w, https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3DGrid-300x183.jpg 300w, https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3DGrid-768x469.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption>Detection of the shape of an object</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2><strong>WIND EFFECT</strong></h2>



<p>The wind is an important disruptive factor for a wildfire and it adds a great layer of realism for the player. &nbsp;Here it could be tempting to&nbsp;over-think&nbsp;the design and go with a very complicated system. After all, it’s an active area of research and&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1540748912001988">several</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378475407002030">papers</a>&nbsp;on the subject are available online.</p>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-s2.0-S0378475407002030-gr3-300x235-1.jpg" alt=""></figure></div>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-s2.0-S1540748912001988-gr3.jpg" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>Luckily, with what have been explained thus far, it’s quite easy to simulate if we accept to cut corners a bit.</p>



<p>In our system, the fire propagates by damaging the&nbsp;neighbor&nbsp;cells on a grid. And it is generally accepted that a fire should spread faster in the direction of the wind than against&nbsp;the wind? Then, with that in mind, we can create a rule where a burning cell deals more damage to its&nbsp;neighbor&nbsp;cells if that neighbor is in the direction of the wind.</p>



<p>We do that by getting the&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">dot product</a>&nbsp;between the wind direction&nbsp;vector and the direction of the&nbsp;neighbor&nbsp;cell to damage.&nbsp;If the result is greater than zero, then that node is dealt greater damage. &nbsp;Likewise, if the result is negative, &nbsp;the node is against the wind and should be dealt less damage. To be fancy, the amount of damage is interpolated with the dot product result as shown in the picture below.<br></p>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACellWindEffect1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACellWindEffect1.jpg 600w, https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACellWindEffect1-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption>The cell on fire causes more damage to its neighbor cells if they are in the direction of the wind.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>With that rule alone, you will get a nice bell shaped fire front that propagates in the direction of the wind. Simple, yet believable&nbsp;enough to get the player’s stamp of approval.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that we simulate gravity the exact same way.</p>



<h2>PROPAGATING TO THINGS AROUND AND CHAIN REACTIONS</h2>



<p>When a cell burns, it sends a “I’m on fire and I burn this much in this radius” message down&nbsp;the game event pipeline. This event is caught by objects, AI and other game systems that are in that area. They react&nbsp;to this message their own specific ways. The AI freaks out, the flammable objects get damaged and eventually catch fire. And, &nbsp;it is also true for dynamic objects. &nbsp;For example, if a burning oil barrel goes flying through the map, every step of the way, &nbsp;it will send that “i’m burning” message and a lot of things around might hear it.<br></p>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridDmgZone.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridDmgZone.jpg 719w, https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridDmgZone-300x284.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px"><figcaption>In the absence of wind, a cell on fire damages equally all its neighbors.</figcaption></figure></div>







<p>This causes a chain reaction effect where trees, explosive items, &nbsp;objects and patches of grass set each others on fire. &nbsp;It’s completely&nbsp;systemic and it makes it much more believable. It &nbsp;also scores pretty high on the&nbsp;player’s&nbsp;fun meter because it behaves as one would expect, yet as real fire, it sometimes gets totally out of control.</p>



<h2>OPTIMISATION</h2>



<p><strong>The Hair Transplant Strategy</strong></p>



<p>In an ideal world, we would have access to enough memory to hold&nbsp;an infinite number of particle emitters and we could display an infinite number of particles on screen.&nbsp;Unfortunately, the reality is that those numbers are actually pretty low.</p>



<p>To do more with less, we have to put our emitters where it really counts. Enters the hair transplant strategy! &nbsp;In Far Cry 2, the fire emitters are constantly being teleported around, most importantly, from the back of the camera to the front. The player’s point of view is monitored at all time and emitters that are burning out of sight are moved to a better location where they are also needed.</p>



<p>In addition, the emitters’s density is higher in close proximity of the player and lower as the distance increases. A kind of fire&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_detail">LOD&nbsp;</a>if you will.&nbsp;If things are getting bad and we still need more emitters but none are available, we increase the particle sizes to give them more volume and fill more space on screen.</p>



<p>With this strategy, and some others, we can simulate a wildfire that is several meters wide with a relatively low number of particle emitters.<br></p>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/farc2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/farc2.jpg 600w, https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/farc2-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption>Credits: http://www.rockpapershotgun.com</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Event Pipeline</strong><br>Since the described system tried to avoid all complicated maths, generally speaking we will be GPU bound before being&nbsp;CPU bound.</p>



<p>That being said, the event pipeline could be a bottleneck. It works well when you have just a few cells on fire. But, it’s another story when you have thousands of them burning and&nbsp;advertising&nbsp;their state to the world. That will likely clog your CPU’s arteries.</p>



<p>The trick for me was to regroup the cells that were burning into&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis-aligned_bounding_box#Axis-aligned_minimum_bounding_box" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AABB</a>&nbsp;groups. These groups would constantly merge, split and&nbsp;change shape to follow the evolution of the fire. The events would then be sent per AABB instead of per cell, which saves&nbsp;a significant amount of processing power. Additionally, the events would be spread out across several frames in order to distribute the load and avoid framerate spikes.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody">
      

      

      

      


      <p>There's a well-known quote by author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pollan">Michael Pollan</a>:
        "Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants." I like it because it doesn't
        attempt to be dogmatic: it encapsulates some basic guiding principles that get
        you 90% of the way there 90% of the time. Wikipedia describes the book the quote
        is from (emphasis mine):</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>He explains...the notion that nutritionism and, therefore, the whole Western
          framework through which we intellectualize the value of food <strong>is more a religious
and faddish devotion to the mythology of simple solutions than a convincing and
reliable conclusion of incontrovertible scientific research</strong>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>That...sounds familiar.</p>
      <h2 id="write-code">Write code </h2>
      <p>Code, like food, has value. I think those of us who write it can (hopefully)
        agree on that. Some, though, are so afraid of writing/eating
        <em>too much</em> that they avoid writing/eating what they should.</p>
      <p>In the context of programming, I think this translates to an unhealthy fear
        (again, for some) of duplication. A little bit of duplication - writing
        something in a way that doesn't completely maximize conciseness - isn't the end
        of the world. Sometimes it's the best path forward. Sometimes it's okay to
        copy-and-modify here and there, especially when you're still figuring out what
        your application will end up being.</p>
      <h2 id="not-too-much">Not too much </h2>
      <p>Of course too much code, like too much food, can also be a bad thing. This is
        a well-trodden topic so I don't feel the need to go too far into it here.</p>
      <p>Just be aware of your project's "appetite": write what needs to be written,
        and then try not to over-indulge.</p>
      <h2 id="mostly-functions">Mostly functions </h2>
      <p>By "functions" here I mean "pure functions". You could make a case that pure
        functions aren't the "plants" of code, though I feel
        that they are. In my experience most codebases have a pure functional
        subset, and I believe writing that subset in a pure-functional style is nearly
        always a win for the long-term health of the project.</p>
      <p>Of course the qualifier is "mostly": this isn't a dogma. Writing a 100%
        functional system ("going vegan", if you will) often requires you to jump
        through a bunch of extra hoops to get all the functionality you need. Looking
        at it solely from the perspective of health, those extra complications may not
        be worth it.</p>
      <p>And then different projects have different needs: just as an athlete may need
        a larger percentage of protein, or individuals may have certain nutrient
        deficiencies, a project may only have a very small functional subset, or may not
        be able to afford to return new values each time due to data size or
        performance-sensitivity. There's nothing wrong with that.</p>
      <h2 id="%22real-code%22">"Real code" </h2>
      <p>Pollan later qualifies his snappy statement a bit further:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>He contends that most of what Americans now buy in supermarkets, fast food
          stores, and restaurants is not in fact food, and that a practical tip is to eat
          only those things that people of his grandmother's generation would have
          recognized as food.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>At the risk of stretching the analogy, maybe the equivalent is
        "code only those things that people at a junior level would recognize for what
        they do". Code in simple, straightforward terms. Don't get too clever,
        "manufacturing artificial ingredients". Use the primitives that are there, when
        possible. Write what is simple, and natural, and human.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Thanks to the feedback I received on Reddit I un-enrolled. “OK I sent&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://realtimclemans.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#48093d3b3c2d26082429252a2c293b2b20272724662b2725" target="_blank"><span data-cfemail="1253676166777c527e737f70767361717a7d7d7e3c717d7f">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://realtimclemans.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#92f3f6fffbe1e1fbfdfce1d2fef3fff0f6f3e1f1fafdfdfebcf1fdff" target="_blank"><span data-cfemail="93f2f7fefae0e0fafcfde0d3fff2fef1f7f2e0f0fbfcfcffbdf0fcfe">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>&nbsp;“The outcomes data that sold me on Lambda turns out to be useless because of LS’ major changes. Please unenroll me. Thank you.”” in response to “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/technicaldebtgames/">technicaldebtgames</a>1 point·<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LambdaSchool/comments/kdxf3k/why_im_enrolling_in_lambda_schools_full_time_web/gg02qmm/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">24 minutes ago</a></p>
<p>Jesus this is a… thing.</p>
<p>Listen, don’t go to LS. It’s a waste of money. If you think you will be working on team projects, you won’t. That was my assumption, too, but the truth is that you are too busy doing course busywork to work on actual projects, and when you finally DO work on a group project, 75% of your group is so unequipped to handle working on literally ANYTHING, that if you are experienced in ANY way, you will be holding everyone’s hand teaching them basic shit that the course should have taught them.</p>
<p>All I got for my time in LS was a github account that looked awful, with half-assed project repos clogging up everything. You will come out of it all and literally remove ALL of them, because they are THAT shameful.</p>
<p>Do not go to this school. Go literally anywhere else.</p>
<p>And in all honesty, if you actually HAVE some experience like your linkedin says, you should just work on your own stuff. Don’t get suckered into this place by slick marketing that sounds like they’re high-speed. They’re just a terrible version of a votech school, except every class will have 200 students and 1 instructor.</p>
<p>HARD PASS on LS. Take Udemy courses and network on slack/discord servers instead, and save yourself months of your life and 10k’s of $.”</p>
<p><strong>Original post: </strong>My mission is to solve the world’s most pressing problems using technology. I’m 30 and haven’t solved a single world pressing problem. So it’s time to stop wasting my time web surfing and go head to head with Bill Gates (put a computer on every desktop running Microsoft software and now reducing inequities and improving lives around the world), Elon Musk (Starlink fast worldwide satellite internet and electric transportation and solar energy generation and storage), John Krafcik (Waymo’s CEO eliminating fatal car crashes with already live self driving cars with no employees inside picking up paying public customers). So my game plan is to spend 15 hours a day starting 12/16/20 going to web development school (starts 1/11/21), reading software development and business books, creating highly profitable startups, writing well researched informative blog posts and daily journal blog posts about my journey, and applying to software development jobs at early stage product market fit companies.</p>

<p>I applied to every school I matched with on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://careerkarma.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://careerkarma.com" target="_blank">CareeerKarma</a> which I found about from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://techcrunch.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://techcrunch.com" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>. I got so pissed off with failing a basic math/logic, verbal skills, and pattern recognition test and being told I needed a high credit score for income sharing agreements that I decided not to enroll in a school. Then I came across <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://lambdaschool.com" target="_blank">Lambda School</a> while surfing <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtube.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://youtube.com" target="_blank">Youtube</a>. The video that pooped up on my homepage is “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqnwwlQuh3U&amp;ab_channel=CodeDripbyAaronJack" data-type="URL" target="_blank" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqnwwlQuh3U&amp;ab_channel=CodeDripbyAaronJack">Disappointing news about code bootcamps in 2020.</a>” by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRLEADhMcb8WUdnQ5_Alk7g" data-type="URL" target="_blank" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRLEADhMcb8WUdnQ5_Alk7g">Aaron Jack</a>. I printed out and read the video’s source material, the article “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/lambda-schools-job-placement-rate-is-lower-than-claimed.html" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/lambda-schools-job-placement-rate-is-lower-than-claimed.html">Lambda School’s Misleading Promises</a>” by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://vincentwoo.com/about/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://vincentwoo.com/about/">Vincent Woo</a>, founder of the successful site <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://coderpad.io/" target="_blank" data-type="URL">CodePad.io</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22366474" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22366474">the Hacker News comments</a>. Then I went to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/" target="_blank">Lambda School’s website</a> and downloaded their <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5cd091cfb5499f22bdf72905/5fc95f2bb39ee0c8b064088b_Lambda%20School%20H2%202019%20Outcomes%20Report.pdf" data-type="URL" target="_blank">H2 2019 Outcomes report (PDF)</a>. The H2 2019 graduation rate of people who withdrew or graduated is 72% (439/609), 170 students withdrew. The job placement rate for job seeking H2 2019 web development graduates is 73% (181/247) with 66 unemployed when the report’s data was analyzed. 8% got jobs paying $100K+ year which is what I’m aiming for. The annual median salary of employed H2 2019 web development graduates is $60K. I’m convinced I have the work ethic to learn and code at a high skill level needed by small team high growth startups.</p>
<p>There’s absolutely no way I would do a loan even if I qualified for one and I’m not going to wait around trying to get a full tuition scholarship. I have zero interest in trying to go to a community college or university where I would have to take a ton of courses that I don’t need. And again would need a loan, pay up front, or get a scholarship. </p>
<p>While I do write code and learn on my own I don’t get the feedback or experience working in a team that I need. </p>
<p>Some unknowns: do placement rates include those hired as Lambda School TAs? <strong>Edit: </strong>they no longer have TAs “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LambdaSchool/comments/kdxf3k/why_im_enrolling_in_lambda_schools_full_time_web/gfzwpma?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.reddit.com/r/LambdaSchool/comments/kdxf3k/why_im_enrolling_in_lambda_schools_full_time_web/gfzwpma?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">To answer your question: no one is hired as a “TA” anymore, but when they existed they were not counted by LS as getting a job. (That would be absurd)</a>” </p>

The Swedish Data Protection Authority is therefore issuing a fine of SEK 550,000 against the university.</p>
<p>The Swedish Data Protection Authority has now completed an audit of Umeå University, concluding that the University has violated the General Data Protection Regulation by processing special categories of personal data without applying appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the data.</p>
<p>A research group at the University had requested from the police preliminary investigation reports concerning cases of male rape and, upon receiving such reports, proceeded to scanning and storing them digitally. The reports contained information on, among other things, suspicion of crime, name, personal identity number and contact details, as well as sensitive data about sexual life and health.</p>
<p>The Swedish Data Protection Authority’s investigation shows that the research group stored over a hundred scanned preliminary investigation reports in an American cloud service, despite the University having informed via its intranet that special categories of data should not be stored in the cloud service in question.</p>
<p>— The cloud service and the way the university uses it does not provide sufficient protection for this type of personal data, says Linda Hamidi, who led the Swedish Data Protection Authority’s audit.</p>
<p>When the research group sent an e-mail to the police requesting further information, one of the scanned reports was attached as a reference, a practice that the research group later repeated despite the fact that the police pointed out the inappropriateness in sending sensitive material in unencrypted e-mails.</p>
<p>— These events show that the University has not taken necessary measures to ensure a level of security appropriate in relation to the risk.</p>
<p>The Swedish Data Protection Authority also criticises the University for failing to report the incident as a personal data breach. Since 25 May 2018, organisations are obliged to report personal data breaches to the Swedish Data Protection Authority.</p>
<p>— The controller is obliged to notify the DPA of data breaches and furthermore to present to us what has been done to mitigate the effects of the incident and to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.</p>
<p>The overall assessment of concluded infringements led to the Swedish Data Protection Authority issuing an administrative fine of SEK 550,000 against the University.</p>

December 15, 2020 | https://www.blogofpascal.com/post/design-systems-are-bullsh-t | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.blogofpascal.com/post/design-systems-are-bullsh-t">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Addressing the Hype</h2><p>There’s no denying the design community has fallen <em>hard </em>for design systems. It’s graduated from popular trend to fully fledged movement. We’re at a point where you can apply for specific design systems jobs and statements like, “<a href="https://uxdesign.cc/everything-you-need-to-know-about-design-systems-54b109851969" target="_blank">in the future, every brand and every product will use a Design System</a>”, appear perfectly reasonable.</p><p>I feel the same way about design systems as I did about design thinking before Natasha Jen gave a talk in 2018 entitled, <a href="https://99u.adobe.com/videos/55967/natasha-jen-design-thinking-is-bullshit" target="_blank">Design Thinking Is Bullsh*t</a>. Namely, why is no one talking about the downsides? </p><p>It turns out that isn’t entirely true. In searching over 200 articles on Medium and other blogs online, I picked up on an undercurrent beneath all the praise that is beginning to check the design systems movement. But it still feels like the criticism has been nervously muted, unnecessarily qualified and caveated. In the name of critical thinking and a healthy debate, I believe it’s time to make the case in no uncertain terms that design systems are, in fact, bullshi*t.</p><h2>Defining Design Systems</h2><p>The root of the problem with design systems can be found in the definition. Here’s a simple description from a popular article on the subject:</p><blockquote>“A Design System is the single source of truth which groups all the elements that will allow the teams to design, realize and develop a product.”<br>~ <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/everything-you-need-to-know-about-design-systems-54b109851969" target="_blank">Everything you need to know about Design Systems</a></blockquote><p>It’s this attempt to take existing tools and practices, like style guides and patterns, and add other less tangible assets such as values and ways or working that, taken together, present a design system as a complete process from start to finish. This is a mistake. The very phrase “design <em>system</em>” should have alarm bells ringing.</p><p>In this quote from Brad Frost defining design systems, we can see further problematic thinking:</p><blockquote>“A kit of UI components without accompanying philosophy, principles, guidelines, processes, and documentation is like dumping a bunch of IKEA components on the floor and saying ‘Here, build a dresser!’ The guidelines and documentation accompanying the UI components serve as the instruction manual that come with the IKEA components to help the user properly and successfully build furniture.”<br>~ <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/link/design-systems/" target="_blank">Design Systems</a></blockquote><p>It’s a neat sounding analogy, but it’s like saying we need a design system so our customers know how to assemble their own app from our react components. It reveals the suggestion that anyone should be able to build a design regardless of expertise. It also surfaces the idea that while some designers (presumably a minority) will have the responsibility for creating the principles and processes, the others will be handed the design system Allen key and charged with the robotic, rote assembly. Hardly an inspiring vision.</p><h2>Design Systems Turn Design Into a Check Box</h2><blockquote>“In today’s world design has become this box that people just want to check off.”<br>~ <a href="https://99u.adobe.com/videos/55967/natasha-jen-design-thinking-is-bullshit" target="_blank">Natasha Jen: Design Thinking Is Bullsh*t</a></blockquote><p>There’s a fair amount of crossover in Jen’s critique of design thinking and the issues we can find with design systems. The biggest crossover is at the core of this idea that the design process should be simplified, sped up and accessible to non-designers.</p><p>By attempting to catalogue and rationalise everything, the result of the design system is to atomise and codify a designer’s process in a way that makes it appear understandable and, worryingly, actionable by anyone regardless of their design competence.</p><p>This devalues design and undermines designers.</p><blockquote>“You cannot hold design in high regard while relegating so much of it to a centrally controlled system.”<br>~ <a href="https://modus.medium.com/suburban-tract-housing-and-the-death-of-craftsmanship-a-critique-of-digital-design-systems-34c0fc1e106f" target="_blank">Design Systems Create Bad Designers</a></blockquote><p>We create systems to automate low-level tasks where the pursuit of efficiency is the driving objective. The underlying perspective in the thinking behind design systems, whether deliberate or not, is that design is in the way of more critical work.</p><h2>Design Systems Waste Time</h2><blockquote>“We’ve been developing the contribution model for the GOV.UK Design System for the best part of 2 years, and we’re not done yet. Not even close.”<br>~ <a href="https://amyhupe.co.uk/articles/the-myth-that-design-systems-solve-easy-problems/" target="_blank">The myth that design systems solve easy problems</a></blockquote><p>Design systems take a massive amount of time and effort to create, and require constant work to maintain, update and evolve. The bigger, the more comprehensive, a design system is, the harder it is to reference quickly and keep relevant. Time must be invested to not only update the system but communicate any changes across teams. The deeper you go down the design system rabbit hole, the more quick sand you lay out for your company to wade through in the future.</p><p>Once the design system is up and running, design is now entangled in development. Making changes to the design system will not be straightforward, potentially requiring sign off from people who may not share the same concerns as design. When design is fused with code, it slows down, and even discourages, changes to the product, as engineering is now needed to maintain and evolve the system. </p><p>Many product designers work for startups who undergo rebranding, product pivots and overhauls of their codebase on a dizzying frequency. I’ve worked at a startup that went through multiple rebrands and product pivots in its first three years. Why bother with a design system in this context? No one will thank you for wasting time on an internal product when you could have been working on the actual product, getting feature validation, finding product market fit or helping marketing and sales achieve broader business objectives.</p><p>It’s true that design systems allow you to go faster in one context — when you’re heading in the wrong direction. Once you finally have your design system ready to go, you can have that design request wrapped up before the day’s out. But by truncating the design process and placing too much emphasis on speed, design systems remove the space needed to question the assumptions behind a task, conceive of new possibilities, or even question if that new feature or screen is needed in the first place. </p><h2>Design Systems Don’t Work</h2><blockquote>“The challenge with any design system is they normally don’t work, don’t get adopted, don’t grow or get used if they are imposed top-down without an awful lot of consultation.”<br>~ <a href="https://markboulton.co.uk/journal/design-systems-in-difficult-places/" target="_blank">Design systems in difficult places</a></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.chromatic.com/blog/why-design-systems-are-a-single-point-of-failure/" target="_blank">Design systems are a single point of failure</a>, as they deliver the same components to multiple product and service touch points across an organisation. One bug or unintended error is now multiplied across every interface. Thanks to the nature of software development, a bug while easy to deploy is much harder to debug. The only solution for engineering is to invest even more effort in testing and maintenance.</p><p>The reality is that the only people who truly adopt design systems are the designers who create them. Design systems are the direct descendants of their equally tedious and ignored forefather, the corporate brand guidelines. In a fast-paced work environment, other team members will drop in and find just what they need in order to move on. They will assume that by any kind of lazy reference to the design system they are now good to go. That has serious consequences for communication and collaboration between teams.</p><h2>Design Systems Ignore Context</h2><blockquote>“Designers are trained and expected to make good decisions based on judgment… To bake this judgment into a system manifested through groupthink is submitting the individual designer’s expertise to an outside force.”<br>~ <a href="https://modus.medium.com/suburban-tract-housing-and-the-death-of-craftsmanship-a-critique-of-digital-design-systems-34c0fc1e106f" target="_blank">Design Systems Create Bad Designers</a></blockquote><p>A design system detracts from what should be any designer’s primary reference: context.</p><p>Now there’s a system, the pressure will be for designers to parse everything through its rules and piece together solutions from the available assets within the system. Coupled with the knowledge that the design system exists in order to sped up their work, contextual research and experimentation within those grey areas early on in the process will be squeezed under an excessively performance-focused culture.</p><p>The very objective of a system is to cover all bases. But this approach is destined to produce mediocre results within design, as any pre-defined system will always lack the critical context ingredient. Taking a component out of context, setting rules and a multitude of variables, creates the false illusion that this component can now be applied without reference to the new context. On top of this, by trying to systematically cover all eventualities the design system creates unnecessary bloat, documenting styles and components that may never even be needed.</p><p>The widely held opinion that a design system has to constantly evolve, is a recognition in itself that it will never be adequate enough to deal with the real world problems it faces. This is often presented as a caveat, but it illustrates flawed and misplaced thinking. If something is always in need of being updated whenever it is put into practice, how can it be relied upon?</p><h2>Design Systems Straitjacket Creativity and Kill Craft</h2><blockquote>“Design systems can make designers lazy, driving them to think only in terms of the components that are available in the design system.”<br>~ <a href="https://uxplanet.org/the-hidden-trap-in-design-systems-4540424f8c1" target="_blank">The Hidden Trap in Design Systems</a></blockquote><p>Design systems choose consistency and convenience over creativity and craft. When you overvalue consistency in the pursuit of uniformity, you create too many unnecessary rules that straitjackets creative thinking before it can even get going. When you overvalue convenience in the pursuit of speed, you kill the holistic working process necessary to develop a designer’s craft.</p><p>Design systems are well meaning, and no one can fault their ambition. But by dismembering the design process with prescriptive step-by-step rules, it restricts a designer’s freedom to work creatively.</p><p>One of the main reasons cited for implementing a design system is to achieve consistency. A slavish devotion to<a href="https://www.blogofpascal.com/post/consistency-the-killer" target="_blank"> consistency kills creative thinking</a>. Building a design system encourages designers to lose themselves in the details of components, while losing sight of larger product design issues. Users don’t care if every border-radius on your …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<section itemprop="text">

<p>I get confused with tensor computation libraries (or computational graph libraries, or symbolic
algebra libraries, or whatever they’re marketing themselves as these days).</p>
<p>I was first introduced to PyTorch and TensorFlow and, having no other reference, thought they were
prototypical examples of tensor computation libraries. Then I learnt about Theano - an older and
less popular project, but different from PyTorch and TensorFlow and better in some meaningful ways.
This was followed by JAX, which seemed to be basically NumPy with more bells and whistles (although
I couldn’t articulate what exactly they were). Then came <a href="https://pymc-devs.medium.com/the-future-of-pymc3-or-theano-is-dead-long-live-theano-d8005f8a0e9b">the announcement by the PyMC developers
that Theano would have a new JAX
backend</a>.</p>
<p>Anyways, this confusion prompted a lot of research and eventually, this blog post.</p>
<p>Similar to <a href="https://eigenfoo.xyz/prob-prog-frameworks/">my previous post on the anatomy of probabilistic programming
frameworks</a>, I’ll first discuss tensor computation
libraries in general - what they are and how they can differ from one another. Then I’ll discuss
some libraries in detail, and finally offer an observation on the future of Theano in the context of
contemporary tensor computation libraries.</p>
<h2 id="dissecting-tensor-computation-libraries">Dissecting Tensor Computation Libraries</h2>
<p>First, a characterization: what do tensor computation libraries even do?</p>
<ol>
<li>They provide ways of specifying and building computational graphs,</li>
<li>They run the computation itself (duh), but also run “related” computations that either (a) <em>use
the computational graph</em>, or (b) operate <em>directly on the computational graph itself</em>,
<ul>
<li>The most salient example of the former is computing gradients via
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05767">autodifferentiation</a>,</li>
<li>A good example of the latter is optimizing the computation itself: think symbolic
simplifications (e.g. <code>xy/x = y</code>) or modifications for numerical stability (e.g. <a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/q/68411"><code>log(1 + x)</code>
for small values of <code>x</code></a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And they provide “best execution” for the computation: whether it’s changing the execution by JIT
(just-in-time) compiling it, by utilizing special hardware (GPUs/TPUs), by vectorizing the
computation, or in any other way.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="tensor-computation-library---maybe-not-the-best-name">“Tensor Computation Library” - Maybe Not The Best Name</h3>
<p>As an aside: I realize that the name “tensor computation library” is too broad, and that the
characterization above precludes some libraries that might also justifiably be called “tensor
computation libraries”. Better names might be “graph computation library” (although that might get
mixed up with libraries like <a href="https://networkx.org/"><code>networkx</code></a>) or “computational graph management
library” or even “symbolic tensor algebra libraries”.</p>
<p>So for the avoidance of doubt, here is a list of libraries that this blog post is <em>not</em> about:</p>
<ul>
<li>NumPy and SciPy
<ul>
<li>These libraries don’t have a concept of a computational graph - they’re more like a toolbox of
functions, called from Python and executed in C or Fortran.</li>
<li>However, this might be a controversial distinction - as we’ll see later, JAX also doesn’t build
an explicit computational graph either, and I definitely want to include JAX as a “tensor
computation library”… <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Numba and Cython
<ul>
<li>These libraries provide best execution for code (and in fact some tensor computation libraries,
such as Theano, make good use them), but like NumPy and SciPy, they do not actually manage the
computational graph itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keras, Trax, Flax and PyTorch-Lightning
<ul>
<li>These libraries are high-level wrappers around tensor computation libraries - they basically
provide abstractions and a user-facing API to utilize tensor computation libraries in a
friendlier way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="some-differences-between-tensor-computation-libraries">(Some) Differences Between Tensor Computation Libraries</h3>
<p>Anyways, back to tensor computation libraries.</p>
<p>All three aforementioned goals are ambitious undertakings with sophisticated solutions, so it
shouldn’t be surprising to learn that decisions in pursuit on goal can have implications for (or
even incur a trade-off with!) other goals. Here’s a list of common differences along all three axes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tensor computation libraries can differ in how they represent the computational graph, and how it
is built.
<ul>
<li>Static or dynamic graphs: do we first define the graph completely and then inject data to run
(a.k.a. define-and-run), or is the graph defined on-the-fly via the actual forward computation
(a.k.a. define-by-run)?
<ul>
<li>TensorFlow 1.x was (in)famous for its static graphs, which made users feel like they were
“working with their computational graph through a keyhole”, especially when <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13429355">compared to
PyTorch’s dynamic graphs</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lazy or eager execution: do we evaluate variables as soon as they are defined, or only when a
dependent variable is evaluated? Usually, tensor computation libraries either choose to support
dynamic graphs with eager execution, or static graphs with lazy execution - for example,
<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager">TensorFlow 2.0 supports both modes</a>.</li>
<li>Interestingly, some tensor computation libraries (e.g. <a href="https://thinc.ai/">Thinc</a>) don’t even
construct an explicit computational graph: they represent it as <a href="https://thinc.ai/docs/concept">chained higher-order
functions</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tensor computation libraries can also differ in what they want to use the computational graph
<em>for</em> - for example, are we aiming to do things that basically amount to running the
computational graph in a “different mode”, or are we aiming to modify the computational graph
itself?
<ul>
<li>Almost all tensor computation libraries support autodifferentiation in some capacity (either
forward-mode, backward-mode, or both).</li>
<li>Obviously, how you represent the computational graph and what you want to use it for are very
related questions! For example, if you want to be able to represent aribtrary computation as a
graph, you’ll have to handle control flow like if-else statements or for-loops - this leads to
common gotchas with <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html#%F0%9F%94%AA-Control-Flow">using Python for-loops in
JAX</a>
or needing to use <a href="https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/can-you-have-for-loops-in-the-forward-prop/68295"><code>torch.nn.ModuleList</code> in for-loops with
PyTorch</a>.</li>
<li>Some tensor computation libraries (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/Theano/Theano">Theano</a> and it’s
fork, <a href="https://theano-pymc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Theano-PyMC</a>) aim to <a href="https://theano-pymc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extending/optimization.html">optimize
the computational graph
itself</a>, for which an
<a href="#an-observation-on-static-graphs-and-theano">explicit graph is necessary</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finally, tensor computation libraries can also differ in how they execute code.
<ul>
<li>All tensor computation libraries run on CPU, but the strength of GPU and TPU support is a major
differentiator among tensor computation libraries.</li>
<li>Another differentiator is how tensor computation libraries compile code to be executed on
hardware. For example, do they use JIT compilation or not? Do they use “vanilla” C or CUDA
compilers, or <a href="https://tensorflow.google.cn/xla">the XLA compiler for machine-learning specific
code</a>?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="a-zoo-of-tensor-computation-libraries">A Zoo of Tensor Computation Libraries</h2>
<p>Having outlined the basic similarities and differences of tensor computation libraries, I think
it’ll be helpful to go through several of the popular libraries as examples. I’ve tried to link to
the relevant documentation where possible.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="pytorch"><a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>How is the computational graph represented and built?
<ul>
<li>PyTorch dynamically builds (and eagerly evaluates) an explicit computational graph. For more
detail on how this is done, check out <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/autograd.html">the PyTorch docs on autograd
mechanics</a>.</li>
<li>For more on how PyTorch computational graphs, see <a href="https://jdhao.github.io/2017/11/12/pytorch-computation-graph/"><code>jdhao</code>’s introductory blog post on
computational graphs in
PyTorch</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the computational graph used for?
<ul>
<li>To quote the <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html">PyTorch docs</a>, “PyTorch is an
optimized tensor library for deep learning using GPUs and CPUs” - as such, the main focus is on
<a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/autograd.html">autodifferentiation</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How does the library ensure “best execution” for computation?
<ul>
<li>PyTorch has <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html">native GPU support</a> via CUDA.</li>
<li>PyTorch also has support for TPU through projects like
<a href="https://github.com/pytorch/xla">PyTorch/XLA</a> and

<ul>
<li>Instead of building an explicit computational graph to compute gradients, JAX simply supplies a
<code>grad()</code> that returns the gradient function of any supplied function. As such, there is
technically no concept of a computational graph - only pure (i.e. stateless and
side-effect-free) functions and their gradients.</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://sjmielke.com/jax-purify.htm">Sabrina Mielke summarizes the situation very well</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PyTorch builds up a graph as you compute the forward pass, and one call to <code>backward()</code> on
some “result” node then augments each intermediate node in the graph with the gradient of the
result node with respect to that intermediate node. JAX on the other hand makes you express
your computation as a Python function, and by transforming it with <code>grad()</code> gives you a
gradient function that you can evaluate like your computation function — but instead of the
output it gives you the gradient of the output with respect to (by default) the first
parameter that your function took as input.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the computational graph used for?
<ul>
<li>According to the <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html">JAX quickstart</a>,
JAX bills itself as “NumPy on the CPU, GPU, and TPU, with great automatic differentiation for
high-performance machine learning research”. Hence, its focus is heavily on
autodifferentiation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How does the library ensure “best execution” for computation?
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is best explained by quoting the <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html">JAX quickstart</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JAX uses XLA to compile and run your NumPy code on […] GPUs and TPUs. Compilation happens
under the hood by default, with library calls getting just-in-time compiled and executed. But
JAX even lets you just-in-time compile your own Python functions into XLA-optimized kernels
[…] Compilation and automatic differentiation can be composed arbitrarily […]</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>For more detail on JAX’s four-function API (<code>grad</code>, <code>jit</code>, <code>vmap</code> and <code>pmap</code>), see
<a href="http://alexminnaar.com/2020/08/15/jax-overview.html">Alex Minaar’s overview of how JAX works</a>.</p>

<li>How is the computational graph represented and built?
<ul>
<li>Theano statically builds (and lazily evaluates) an explicit computational graph.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the computational graph used for?
<ul>
<li>Theano is unique among tensor computation libraries in that it places more emphasis on
reasoning about the computational graph itself. In other words, while Theano has <a href="https://theano-pymc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/library/gradient.html">strong
support for
autodifferentiation</a>,
running the computation and computing gradients isn’t the be-all and end-all: Theano has an
entire module for <a href="https://theano-pymc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/optimizations.html">optimizing the computational graph
itself</a>, and makes it fairly
straightforward to compile the …</li></ul></li></ol></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Mass broadcasting in ultra low latency never be that much easy! Welcome back to our third article about scaling Ant Media Server to 70K viewers in less than a half-hour using the CloudFormation. If you missed the previous parts, we covered scaled up to <a href="https://antmedia.io/scale-10k-ultra-low-latency-viewers-quickly/">10K</a> and <a href="https://antmedia.io/scaling-webrtc-streaming-30k-cloudformation/">30K</a>.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll look at creating our 70K system for some use cases such as webinars conference room applications. Let’s get started.</p>
<h2><strong>Cost and Performance</strong></h2>
<p>Scaling WebRTC streaming is a powerful ability but it is in the grip of two factors you should consider; Cost and Performance. Each will attract you in the opposite direction. Thus you have to strike a balance between them.</p>
<p>You are going to need to decide what is the equilibrium point for your use case and the resources you have. If you already know that your use case this is a quick refresher: You can use <a href="https://antmedia.io/cost-calculator/">Ant Media Cost Calculator</a> to define your overall cost.</p>
<p><span>In the test environment, we are going to use the same number of Load Balancers and Databases, and only for this time, we’re going to increase the number of edge instances from 25 to 36, and the number of Loads instances from 30 to 60. Have a look at that here for a quick </span><a href="https://antmedia.io/scale-10k-ultra-low-latency-viewers-quickly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refresher</a><span>.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Benchmark Conclusions for Mass Broadcasting</strong></h2>
<p>We announced the release of Ant Media 2.2. This is pretty exciting as the 2.2.1 version has a performance increase of around 30% and the average CPU value of edge instances is between 60-65%. Ant Media Server performs just as well as we expected and scales nicely with increased cluster size. Now you will able to achieve 2000 viewers on just a 32 CPU machine.</p>
<p>The first set of tests was run on a default setup plan for 10K – 30K use cases.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/70K_10K-300x142.png" alt="Mass Broadcasting Made Easy with Ant Media WebRTC Solution - 70K Unlocked! 1" width="300" height="142" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/70K_10K-300x142.png 300w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/70K_10K-1024x484.png 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/70K_10K-768x363.png 768w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/70K_10K-1536x726.png 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/70K_10K-600x284.png 600w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/70K_10K.png 1914w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" title="Mass Broadcasting Made Easy with Ant Media WebRTC Solution - 70K Unlocked! 1"> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/70K_30K-300x142.png" alt="Mass Broadcasting Made Easy with Ant Media WebRTC Solution - 70K Unlocked! 2" width="300" height="142" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/70K_30K-300x142.png 300w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/70K_30K-1024x485.png 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/70K_30K-768x364.png 768w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/70K_30K-1536x727.png 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/70K_30K-600x284.png 600w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/70K_30K.png 1914w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" title="Mass Broadcasting Made Easy with Ant Media WebRTC Solution - 70K Unlocked! 2"></p>
<p>The performance is pretty respectable. As you will see in the next graph for the bigger test, we are going to increase the number of viewers to 70K. It seems that there is no even a single connection drop for the viewers. It’s exactly 70001.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’re continuously releasing new capabilities to enable more people to be productive and compliant when working with Apache Kafka.</p><p>Our engineers have been hard at work on a great Christmas present for our amazing community of Kafka users.&nbsp;</p><p>Before unwrapping our latest and greatest release, here’s a sneak peak of what’s inside. </p><h2>Streaming SQL workloads on Kafka Connect</h2><p>In July, we revamped our <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/07/Why-new-Streaming-SQL-opens-up-data-platform/">Streaming SQL engine</a> for powerful data processing minus the typical operational and development complexities.&nbsp;</p><p>This came with a new deployment framework (“DAD” as we call it).</p><p>You’ve got enough distributed technologies to manage. So we built the framework to simplify deploying streaming SQL workloads on your existing infrastructure alongside wherever you run your other applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For our first DAD Release, we included support for Kubernetes. And now we’re extending the framework to deploy your workloads over your Kafka Connect infrastructure too!</p><p>If you want to understand how it works, checkout our recent <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYjVgyWzGVE">CNCF webinar.</a> </p><h2>Powered-up Streaming SQL for complex data structures
</h2><p>Speaking of Streaming SQL, Lenses 4.1 comes packed with new features that make life even easier when processing data with complex data structures.  We’ve introduced<a href="https://docs.lenses.io/4.1/sql/functions/#array-functions"> 6 new functions to work with arrays</a>, better support for array literals, and lateral joins.
</p><p>All these features are available both for our Snapshot and Streaming SQL engines.
</p><p>Lateral joins for example is a new kind of join that allows you to extract and work with the single elements found inside an array, as if the array was a normal table.
</p><p>As a basic example converting the structure:
</p><p><code>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[100,&nbsp;101,&nbsp;102]&nbsp;},</code></p><p>To single-value structure such as:</p><p><code>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"reading":&nbsp;100&nbsp;},&nbsp;</code></p><p><code>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"reading":&nbsp;101&nbsp;},&nbsp;</code></p><p><code>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"reading":&nbsp;102&nbsp;},</code></p><p>This means you can define even more types of data processing workloads with SQL rather than on complex stream-processing frameworks.&nbsp;</p><p>Read Nicolò’s <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/12/exploding-arrays-in-kafka-with-lateral-joins">blog about Lateral Joins</a> for more detail.</p><h2>Explore Kafka Message Headers with SQL</h2><p>Apache Kafka 0.11 introduced headers to messages in Kafka. A very welcome feature.</p><p>Kafka Headers are useful for annotating, auditing, monitoring and routing of events as they flow through Kafka.&nbsp;</p><p>This opens up a number of new use cases, including for monitoring data lineage and distributed tracing, that help make Kafka more governable and allow you to offer higher service-levels to your users.</p><p>Our new release now allows you to query headers alongside Kafka message payload and key with the Lenses snapshot SQL engine. This will radically accelerate the time to investigate incidents and problems. </p><p>See our <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/12/kafka-distributed-tracing-with-message-headers">message headers blog</a> for more information.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/3DXYl9WI25AbGTgnkvvvnm/b06a02dde2ccc551a77c7e0a63a83fb9/lenses.io_kafka_headers.png" alt="Query Kafka Message Headers with Lenses.io and SQL"></p><h2>Data Policies namespaces</h2><p>Data privacy has been a first-class citizen of Lenses since the beginning.&nbsp; Policies allow you to discover and anonymize data within your streaming data. This means data can be socialized across your business whilst maintaining top notch compliance.</p><p>Data Policies were applied globally across all matching Kafka streams and Elasticsearch indexes. This wasn’t always what everyone needed. As an example, an emailAddress field should be anonymized for production topics and not across dev topics.&nbsp;</p><p>So whilst you're defining Data Policies you can now apply policies based on specific topic namespaces.&nbsp;</p><p>Read more about the latest Data Policies features and how to protect your data in our blog <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/12/life-of-pii-data-masking-and-compliance-for-apache-kafka/">life of PII for Apache Kafka</a>.</p><h2>Kafka Connect multi-tenancy
</h2><p>We see many of you are managing dozens if not hundreds of Kafka Connect clusters. Often in a multi-tenant fashion. 

Operating so many clusters puts a strain on good governance and adds risk. 
</p><p>Not only should you control what topics users and connectors can access but also potentially completely isolate tenants to your platform for compliance. Avoiding them even seeing other tenants clusters let alone having access to them. </p><p>The Lenses security model has protected which Kafka topics users can access (on top of what you may have already with ACLs). We’ve now extended this security model so users can set privileges over which Connect clusters can be accessed by whom. 
</p><p>To understand more about applying compliance and governance to Kafka Connect, <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/12/kafka-connect-top-compliance-controls/">some further reading here.</a></p><h2>App Catalog Drilldown</h2><p>The Topology view is one of our most popular features. It provides a view of the lineage of real-time data flows. Very useful for impact analysis and troubleshooting for example.&nbsp;</p><p>We’re now simplifying the workflow so you can understand the relationships between data and applications with an instant drill down from a data flow to an enhanced view of an App’s metadata.&nbsp;</p><p>This shows detailed information about an application generating data including state, health and business metadata. </p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/27xzELE1DIze9sHpkEFW8O/7531062a27fdecbb10672f03742b1e78/app-catalog-lenses-4.1.png" alt="app-catalog-lenses-4.1"></p><h2>Take her for a spin?</h2><p>The release is packed with more features including support for recursive schemas, new Kafka Connect Alerting and improvements to how you can manage your license keys.&nbsp; Full release notes can be found here: <a href="https://docs.lenses.io/4.1/release-notes/">https://docs.lenses.io/4.1/release-notes</a></p><p>Experience the latest version in a cloud demo environment or as an <a href="https://lenses.io/start/">all-in-one Kafka &amp; Lenses docker now</a>!</p><p>Merry Christmas and a thanks to everyone in the community for their wonderful support.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]>

The most common way to authenticate users is by using the email/password combo. Unfortunately, <a href="https://blog.cotter.app/medium-and-slack-moved-away-from-passwords-and-heres-a-reason-why-you-should-too/">passwords have serious disadvantages on both security and user interface</a>. <strong>In this tutorial, we'll use a verification code sent to the user's email to authenticate the user</strong>.</p><p>Authorization is a way for your server to authorize a request. In simpler terms, this is where you pass in a token or session to your backend server when calling an API to view or update some data. The 2 common strategies are <strong>cookie-based sessions</strong> and <strong>JWT tokens</strong>. </p><p>The main advantage for JWT tokens is that it's not stored in your database so you don't need to do a DB check to validate every request. That's why <strong>we're going to use JWT Tokens in this tutorial.</strong></p><p><a href="https://blog.cotter.app/what-on-earth-is-oauth-super-simple-intro-to-oauth-20-access-tokens-and-how-to-implement-it-in-your-site/">Learn more about how OAuth 2.0 and Access Token works.</a></p><h3 id="how-would-the-overall-registration-login-look-like">How would the overall registration/login look like?</h3><p><strong>Authentication: </strong>We'll ask for the user's email and send them an email containing a code. If the user enters the code correctly, we'll get a JWT Token in the frontend and store it in <code>localStorage</code>.</p><p><strong>Authorization: </strong>Every time we want to access a private API endpoint we need to include a header <code>Authorization: Bearer ${token}</code>.</p><blockquote>Storing the token in the browser local storage is susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. If an attacker can successfully run JavaScript code in your site, they can retrieve the tokens stored in local storage. XSS vulnerability arises when your website takes data from users without proper validation or from a third-party JavaScript code (like Google Analytics, jQuery, etc) included in the website.</blockquote><h2 id="let-s-start-building">Let's Start Building</h2><p>Create your Next.js app. We'll call the app <code>next-passwordless-login</code> and use the default starter app.</p><pre><code>yarn create next-app

<p>Today, Pornhub took down all videos from unverified accounts after a New York Times report documented instances of nonconsensual pornography and child sexual abuse material on the service.</p>
<p>But the Times editorial isn't what spurred the shutdown: rather, it was the decision by Visa and Mastercard to withdrawn Pornhub's payment processing that prompted Pornhub to take action.</p>
<p>You may count that as a win. No one with any kind of moral center endorses nonconsensual pornography, especially when it involves children, and the less there is out there, the better the world is. I agree.</p>
<p>But we should also be worried about the growing monopolization of payment processing, and the role that payment processors are coming to play as gatekeepers for all kinds of activities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/visa-and-mastercard-are-trying-dictate-what-you-can-watch-pornhub">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/visa-and-mastercard-are-trying-dictate-what-you-can-watch-pornhub</a></p>
<p>Mastercard and Visa are not qualified to make those calls. More importantly, no one elected them to make those calls. No law requires them to make those calls, and any law that tried would likely be unconstitutional.</p>
<p>If you want a sex industry based on consent and dignity, this should doubly worry you. After all, the first group of people shut down by payment processors' arbitrary judgements about what speech should and should exist were independent sex-workers.</p>
<p><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/160488/nick-kristof-holy-war-pornhub">https://newrepublic.com/article/160488/nick-kristof-holy-war-pornhub</a></p>
<p>It took years for the payment processors to work their way up to the monopolistic, sprawling porn empire behind Pornhub – a Canadian company called Mindgeek that maintains the pretense that it is headquartered in Luxembourg,a notorious tax-evasion jurisdiction.</p>
<p>There's an old saw that the sex industry are early tech adopters. That's not quite true – rather, people with disfavored views are the first people for whom it's worth figuring out new technologies, since the old ones are unavailable to them.</p>
<p>Porn got into home films because most big cinemas wouldn't screen pornography. They got into VHS because it was easier to duplicate than film. They got into the net because it offered access without social costs of being seen in the adult section of the video rental place.</p>
<p>But while pornographers aren't early adopters, they ARE leading indicators. Pornographers' fights with novel censorship tactics are also trial-runs for using those tactics against OTHER people – and payment processors have already been pressed into service.</p>
<p>Visa and Mastercard threats have been used to block or shut down journalism, self-published books, dating services.</p>
<p>Mindgeek and Pornhub don't need our sympathy, but hard cases make bad law.</p>
<p>With only a few payment processors online, our ability to engage in legal conduct will always be at the mercy of Visa, Mastercard and a handful of others.</p>

<img src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/Highway_Robbery-Clean-6.jpg?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/Highway_Robbery-Clean-6.jpg?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>

<p>If you're charged with a crime, the prosecutor has to prove you did it beyond a reasonable doubt; when it's a civil case, it's up to YOU to prove based on "preponderance of evidence" that you are innocent. A real difference, especially when the accused is an inanimate object.</p>
<p>In civil asset forfeiture, police seize the goods of people they suspect of criminal activity – without the need for a charge or conviction – and sue that property (i.e. "State of Iowa v Six Tons of Bricks") and you pay a lawyer to prove your property's innocence.</p>
<p>If your lawyer loses (or if you can't afford a lawyer), you lose your stuff, and the cops get to keep it or sell it and keep the money as an off-the-books black budget. Cops love this money – it lets them buy military surveillance gear.</p>
<p><a href="https://revealnews.org/article/chicago-and-los-angeles-have-used-dirt-box-surveillance-for-a-decade/">https://revealnews.org/article/chicago-and-los-angeles-have-used-dirt-box-surveillance-for-a-decade/</a></p>
<p>But not just that: one sheriff stole $70k from his townspeople and used the money to buy a muscle car that he only drove to and from work.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/feds-want-reimbursement-for-gwinnett-sheriff-70k-muscle-car/zkOidGb5oRfCHGO5RlZGsL/">https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt–politics/feds-want-reimbursement-for-gwinnett-sheriff-70k-muscle-car/zkOidGb5oRfCHGO5RlZGsL/</a></p>
<p>City attorneys have worked with cops in the past to draw up "wish lists" of stuff they'd like to steal. The cops then nose around the owners of that stuff, looking for a pretence to seize it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/us/police-use-department-wish-list-when-deciding-which-assets-to-seize.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/us/police-use-department-wish-list-when-deciding-which-assets-to-seize.html</a></p>
<p>Indeed, police departments future budgets projected their forfeiture revenues for years to come, effectively setting a quota for how much they had to steal from people each year:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/dc-police-plan-for-future-seizure-proceeds-years-in-advance-in-city-budget-documents/2014/11/15/7025edd2-6b76-11e4-b053-65cea7903f2e_story.html">https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/dc-police-plan-for-future-seizure-proceeds-years-in-advance-in-city-budget-documents/2014/11/15/7025edd2-6b76-11e4-b053-65cea7903f2e_story.html</a></p>
<p>By 2014, US police were stealing more from the people they were sworn to protect than all the nation's burglars combined.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/international-news/north_america/americas-current-economy/police-civil-asset-forfeitures-exceed-all-burglaries-in-2014/">https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/international-news/north_america/americas-current-economy/police-civil-asset-forfeitures-exceed-all-burglaries-in-2014/</a></p>
<p>No wonder that by 2015 Congress ended the program (don't worry, Trump reinstated and expanded it):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/23/the-feds-just-shut-down-a-huge-program-that-lets-cops-take-your-stuff-and-keep-it/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/23/the-feds-just-shut-down-a-huge-program-that-lets-cops-take-your-stuff-and-keep-it/</a></p>
<p>Long after the program was ended, cops insisted that without forfeiture, they lacked the "incentive" to fight crime:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/taken/2019/02/03/sc-civil-forfeiture-police-defend-practice-say-funds-essential-law-enforcement/2746412002/">https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/taken/2019/02/03/sc-civil-forfeiture-police-defend-practice-say-funds-essential-law-enforcement/2746412002/</a></p>
<p>They predicted that without forfeiture, police budgets would be too strained to fight crime, while criminals' coffers would swell. That was the scare-story New Mexico's legislature heard in 2015 when the state ended civil forfeiture.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/police-say-seizing-property-without-trial-helps-keep-crime-down-a-new-study-shows-theyre-wrong">https://www.propublica.org/article/police-say-seizing-property-without-trial-helps-keep-crime-down-a-new-study-shows-theyre-wrong</a></p>
<p>Five years later, the verdict is in, and the cops' predictions were wrong. A new report from The Institute for Justice shows that NM experienced no rise in crime, no drop in arrests, and "arrest/offense rates consistent with trends in two neighboring states, CO and TX."</p>
<p><a href="https://ij.org/report/policing-for-profit-3/">https://ij.org/report/policing-for-profit-3/</a></p>
<p>The study shows that far from being an instrument to return stolen goods or make restitution to crime victims, forfeiture is a way to fatten police budgets and personally enrich police officials. The seizures are mostly small-dollar amounts (not drug dealer money).</p>
<p>The larger seizures tell an even worse story: they include numerous instances in which a family home was seized because an underage offender sold small quantities of drugs from the premises – leaving families to spend fortunes defending their homes, often unsuccessfully.</p>

<p>Back in September, we got a glimpse of upcoming EU tech competition rules, courtesy of a leak from the European Commission; they set out an ambitious set of rules on mergers, self-dealing, surveillance, and interoperability.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/30/death-to-all-monopoly/#whither-structural-separation">https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/30/death-to-all-monopoly/#whither-structural-separation</a></p>
<p>The proposal wasn't perfect, but it was still exciting and encouraging, especially the interoperability proposals. Interop, after all, is the judo that every one of today's tech giants used to beat the companies that came before them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/samba-versus-smb-adversarial-interoperability-judo-network-effects">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/samba-versus-smb-adversarial-interoperability-judo-network-effects</a></p>
<p>Today, the Commission published the first public draft of its rules (these need to get through the EU Parliament and the Council of national governments):</p>
<p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en">https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en</a></p>
<p>The Digital Markets Act and its companion, the Digital Services Act, are the first major update to EU e-commerce rules in nearly two decades. A LOT has changed since the E-Commerce Directive!</p>
<p>For a quick overview, I recommend my EFF colleagues Christoph Schmon and Karen Gullo's analysis:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/european-commissions-proposed-regulations-require-platforms-let-users-appeal">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/european-commissions-proposed-regulations-require-platforms-let-users-appeal</a></p>
<p>The good news: the proposal requires due process for content removal – not a system where filters remove your content in an eyeblink and then you spend months or years in autoresponder hell trying to get it back up.</p>
<p>It doesn't require giant companies to police their users' speech, a rule that has led to mass-scale censorship, especially targeted against marginalized people who lack the platform and resources to complain when they get blocked.</p>
<p>It includes <em>very</em> steep penalties for companies that don't comply (up to 6% of annual global revenue), and a means to reach beyond EU borders to sanction companies that do business in the EU – both measures are powerful and potentially dangerous, and both need more specifics.</p>
<p>One disappointment: the interoperability measures have been weakened since September's leaks, though Article 6 of the Digital Markets Act is still a strict and far-reaching set of pro-competition rules with some look-in for interop.</p>
<p>Here's some A6 highlights, rules for the largest tech companies ("gatekeeper companies"):</p>
<ul>
<li>A ban on combining platform data with data from third parties and on automatically logging users from one service on a platform to other ones
</li>
<li>
<p>A requirement to let businesses on the platform offer services and pricing that directly competes with the platform owner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A requirement to let businesses on the platform do subscription and payment with users on their own terms, without having to use the platform</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A ban on blocking businesses on the platform from complaining about abuses to regulators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A ban on …</p></li></ul></div></article></div>

<p>In early 2019, we started visiting campuses across India to recruit the best and brightest minds to ensure LinkedIn, and all the services that make up its complex technology stack, is always available for everyone. This critical function at Linkedin falls under the purview of the Site Engineering team and Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) who are Software Engineers specializing in reliability. SREs apply the principles of computer science and engineering to the design, development and operation of computer systems: generally, large scale, distributed ones</p>
<p>As we continued on this journey we started getting a lot of questions from these campuses on what exactly the site reliability engineering role entails? And, how could someone learn the skills and the disciplines involved to become a successful site reliability engineer? Fast forward a few months, and a few of these campus students had joined LinkedIn either as interns or as full-time engineers to become a part of the Site Engineering team; we also had a few lateral hires who joined our organization who were not from a traditional SRE background. That's when a few of us got together and started to think about how we can onboard new graduate engineers to the Site Engineering team.</p>
<p>There is a vast amount of resources scattered throughout the web on what the roles and responsibilities of SREs are, how to monitor site health, production incidents, define SLO/SLI etc. But there are very few resources out there guiding someone on the basic skill sets one has to acquire as a beginner. Because of the lack of these resources, we felt that individuals have a tough time getting into open positions in the industry. We created the School Of SRE as a starting point for anyone wanting to build their career as an SRE.</p>
<p>In this course, we are focusing on building strong foundational skills. The course is structured in a way to provide more real life examples and how learning each of these topics can play an important role in day to day SRE life. Currently we are covering the following topics under the School Of SRE:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fundamentals Series<ul>
<li><a href="https://linkedin.github.io/school-of-sre/linux_basics/intro/">Linux Basics</a></li>
<li><a href="https://linkedin.github.io/school-of-sre/git/git-basics/">Git</a></li>
<li><a href="https://linkedin.github.io/school-of-sre/linux_networking/intro/">Linux Networking</a></li>

</li>
<li><a href="https://linkedin.github.io/school-of-sre/python_web/intro/">Python and Web</a></li>
<li>Data<ul>
<li><a href="https://linkedin.github.io/school-of-sre/databases_sql/intro/">Relational databases(MySQL)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://linkedin.github.io/school-of-sre/databases_nosql/intro/">NoSQL concepts</a></li>

<li><a href="https://linkedin.github.io/school-of-sre/security/intro/">Security</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We believe continuous learning will help in acquiring deeper knowledge and competencies in order to expand your skill sets, every module has added references which could be a guide for further learning. Our hope is that by going through these modules we should be able to build the essential skills required for a Site Reliability Engineer.</p>
<p>At Linkedin, we are using this curriculum for onboarding our non-traditional hires and new college grads into the SRE role. We had multiple rounds of successful onboarding experience with new employees and the course helped them be productive in a very short period of time. This motivated us to open source the content for helping other organizations in onboarding new engineers into the role and provide guidance for aspiring individuals to get into the role. We realize that the initial content we created is just a starting point and we hope that the community can help in the journey of refining and expanding the content.

					<div><p>Our oceans will be flooded with an estimated 1.56 billion face masks in 2020 says a report released today by Hong-Kong-based marine conservation organization OceansAsia. This will result in an additional 4,680 to 6,240 metric tonnes of marine plastic pollution, says the report, entitled “Masks on the Beach: The Impact of COVID-19 on Marine Plastic Pollution.” These masks will take as long as 450 years to break down, slowly turning into&nbsp; micro plastics while negatively impacting marine wildlife and ecosystems.</p>
<p>The report used a global production estimate of 52 billion masks being manufactured in 2020, a conservative loss rate of 3%, and the average weight of 3 to 4 grams for a single-use polypropylene surgical face mask to arrive at the estimate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The 1.56 billion face masks that will likely enter our oceans in 2020 are just the tip of the iceberg,” says Dr. Teale Phelps Bondaroff, Director of Research for OceansAsia, and lead author of the report. “The 4,680 to 6,240 metric tonnes of face masks are just a small fraction of the estimated 8 to 12 million metric tonnes of plastic that enter our oceans each year.”</p></div>

					<div><p>Plastic consumption, which has been steadily rising for years, increased significantly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>“Hygiene concerns and greater reliance on take-away food has led to increased use of plastics, particularly plastic packaging,” says Gary Stokes, Director of Operations of OceansAsia. “Meanwhile, a number of measures designed to reduce plastic consumption, like single-use plastic bag bans, have been delayed, paused, or rolled back.”</p><p>The use of PPE, in particular face masks, has become a common tool used in preventing the spread of the virus, with many jurisdictions mandating the wearing of masks in public. The production of PPE has expanded in an attempt to meet skyrocketing demand, and PPE waste has also increased dramatically.&nbsp;</p><p>Single-use face masks are made from a variety of meltblown plastics and are difficult to recycle due to both composition and risk of contamination and infection. They enter oceans when they are littered, when waste management systems are inadequate or non-existent, or when these systems become overwhelmed due to increased volumes of waste.</p><p>“Marine plastic pollution is devastating our oceans,” says Gary Stokes, Operations Director of OceansAsia. “Plastic pollution kills an estimated 100,000 marine mammals and turtles, over a million seabirds, and even greater numbers of fish, invertebrates and other animals each year. It also negatively impacts fisheries and the tourism industry, and costs the global economy an estimated $13 billion USD per year.”</p></div>

Update 2017-09-25: Simplified the table syntax even more

</p>

<p>

Update 2018-04-06: Comments on the standardization argument

</p>

<p>

Update 2019-04-12: Extended syntax examples, "Makes Sense Outside of Emacs", "Tool Support" and added more backlinks

</p>

<p>

Update 2020-05-02: Comment by Ian Zimmerman

</p>

<p>

Disclaimer: this is a very nerdy blog entry. It is about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language">lightweight markup languages</a> and why I think that Org mode is the best lightweight markup language for many use-cases. And with lightweight markup language, I do mean the syntax, the way you express headings, lists, font variations such as bold face or italic, and such things.

</p>

<p>

Please do note that this is not about Emacs. This is about Org mode syntax and its advantages even when used outside of Emacs. You can type Org mode in <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Notepad">notepad.exe</a>, <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>, and all other text editors out there. And in my opinion it does have advantages compared to the other, common lightweight markup standards such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc">AsciiDoc</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki#Editing">Wikitext</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText">reStructuredText</a>.

</p>

<p>

Of course, Org mode is my favorite syntax. Despite my personal choice you will see that I've got some pretty convincing arguments that underline my statement as well. So this is not just a matter of personal taste.

</p>

<p>

If you already have a grin on your face because you don't have any clue what this is all about: keep on reading. It makes an excellent example for making fun of nerds at your next dinner party. ;-)

</p>

	  <header><h2>Org-Mode Is Intuitive, Easy to Learn and Remember</h2></header>

<p>

Here you are. This is almost anything you need to know about Org mode syntax:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> * This Is A Heading
 ** This Is A Sub-Heading
 *** And A Sub-Sub-Heading

 Paragraphs are separated by at least one empty line.

 *bold* /italic/ _underlined_ +strikethrough+ =monospaced=
 [[http://Karl-Voit.at][Link description]]
 http://Karl-Voit.at → link without description

 - list item
 - another item
   - sub-item
     1. also enumerated
     2. if you like
 - [ ] yet to be done
 - [X] item which is done

 : Simple pre-formatted text such as for source code.
 : This also respects the line breaks. *bold* is not bold here.	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

And yes, for the people with advanced syntax in mind, this is not everything. Just the basics. A common objection is that source code needs a begin and an end marker instead of a string prefix like <code>: </code> and Org mode is providing this as well:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> #+BEGIN_SRC python
 myresult = 42 * 23
 print('Hello Europe! ' + str(myresult))
 #+END_SRC	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

I've seen many coworkers who typed Org mode markup when taking notes in their text editor. And they did not even know anything about it. So it is that intuitive I'd say.

</p>

<p>

While I was learning Org mode, I did not even use a cheat-sheet for the syntax as I normally do. It was very natural for me to type Org mode right from the start.

</p>

<p>

Tables are a bit more complicated like in all other markup languages I know of:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> | My Column 1 | My Column 2 | Last Column |
 |-------------+-------------+-------------|
 |          42 | foo         | bar         |
 |          23 | baz         | abcdefg     |
 |-------------+-------------+-------------|
 |          65 |             |             |	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

You most probably won't type a table like this outside of Emacs. The manual alignment without tool-support is very tedious. But even here you are able to deliver a perfectly fine Org mode table by simply ignoring the alignment altogether:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> | My Column 1|My Column 2 | Last Column |
 |-
 | 42 | foo | bar|
 | 23 | baz | abcdefg|
 |-
 | 65 |||	  </pre>
    </div>

	  <header><h2>Org-Mode Is Standardized</h2></header>

<p>

This is an almost ridiculous argument because in my opinion a markup is of no use when it is not the same for tool A as for tool B.

</p>

<p>

However, there are markup languages that are different. For example the very widely used markup language named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> has many flavors to choose from:

</p>
<ul>
<li>the original writeup and implementation by John Gruber</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Markdown_Extra">Markdown Extra</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MultiMarkdown">MultiMarkdown</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> Flavored Markdown</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#CommonMark">CommonMark</a> which tries to standardize the Markdown standard (again)</li>
</ul>

<p>

<a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> lists six different Markdown flavors as output formats. This is an absolutely bad situation which foils the original idea behind lightweight markup languages. When some web service tells me that I can use "Markdown" for a text field, I have to dig deeper to find out which of those many different Markdown standards the web page is talking about. After this I will have to continue and look for a cheat-sheet of this dialect because nothing is more difficult to differentiate than multiple standards that are almost the same but not really the same. A usability hell. I get furious every time I have to enter this hell.

</p>

<p>

An additional notion is the lack of standardization of file extensions using Markdown syntax. I've seen <code>.md</code>, <code>.mkdn</code>, <code>.markdown</code> and even <code>.txt</code> (in Markdown).

</p>

<p>

With Org mode, life is easy. The snippet from the previous section explains all there is. Any tool that interprets Org mode accepts this simple and easy to remember syntax. The extension is always <code>.org</code>.

</p>

	  <header><h2>Org-Mode Is Consistent</h2></header>

<p>

Many lightweight markup languages do offer multiple ways of typing headings. There are basically three ways of defining headings:

</p>
<ol>
<li>Prefix headings</li>
<li>Pre- and postfix headings</li>
<li>Underlined headings</li>
</ol>

<p>

Here are some examples for each category:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> Prefix headings:

 # Heading 1
 ## Heading 2
 ### Heading 3

 Pre- and postfix headings:

 = Heading 1 =
 == Heading 2 ==
 === Heading 3 ===

 Underlined headings:

 Heading 1
 =========

 Heading 2
 ~~~~~~~~~

 Heading 3
 *********	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

I prefer the prefix heading style. Org mode use this as well with <code>*</code> as prefix characters. The more asterisks, the deeper the level of the heading is.

</p>

<p>

<b>Pre- and postfix headings</b> do offer bad usability. The user has manually synchronize the number of prefix character with the number of postfix characters. And it is totally unclear how something like <code>=<code> heading </code>==</code> with different numbers of pre/postfix characters is going to turn out when being interpreted.

</p>

<p>

And in case the user already used a markup language with simple prefix headings, it is not logical why there is the need for the postfix characters at all.

</p>

<p>

Even worse than this is the <b>underlined heading category</b>. The user is completely irritated for multiple reasons. Besides the tedious manual work to align the stupid heading characters with the heading title, it is not clear what characters must be used for those heading lines. If you've got a bigger document with different levels of headings you get confused which heading character stands for which heading level.

</p>

<p>

Are the tilde characters level one? Or was it the equals characters? And how about asterisks? Without a cheat-sheet, the occasional markup user is completely lost.

</p>

<p>

This gets even more worse: some markup languages let you choose your "order" of heading characters. This results in weird situations. For example one author is starting to write a reStructuredText document using her favorite heading syntax. A second author is joining in and has to analyze the document in order to know what heading syntax he must use.

</p>

<p>

In the <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/emacs.html">reStructuredText mode of Emacs</a> you can find following function:

</p>

<blockquote>You can visualize the hierarchy of the section adornments in the
current buffer by invoking <code>rst-display-adornments-hierarchy</code>, bound
on <code>C-c C-a C-d</code>. A temporary buffer will appear with fake section
titles rendered in the style of the current document. This can be
useful when editing other people's documents to find out which section
adornments correspond to which levels.</blockquote>

<p>

Yes, you got it right, it is true: this function's only purpose is to generate a dummy-hierarchy of headings to visualize which markup has to be used for heading 1, which one for heading 2 and so forth just for this single document. What a bad design decision of the markup when you need such hacks just to know how a heading should look like in a markup even if you are familiar with in the first place.

</p>

<p>

Here is one more: some markup languages even allow <b>mixed heading styles</b>. You can use an underlined heading style for heading level 1, a prefix style for level 2, another underlining style for level 3 and so forth. Now the chaos is a perfect one.

</p>

<p>

Let's have a look at a different markup element: <b>external links</b>. As you already remember in Org mode, a link looks like this:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> [[http://Karl-Voit.at][my home page]]	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

The only difficult thing here is to remember that the URL is at the beginning and the description follows after the URL. Many markup languages do add additional and unnecessary levels of difficulties.

</p>

<p>

Here are some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language#Link_syntax">examples from Wikipedia</a> and comments by me where a user might be irritated.

</p>

<p>

AsciiDoc:

</p>

	  

<p>

The form is simple but for complex URLs, the <code>[Text]</code> might look like being part of the URL itself. Not beautiful but at least something I could live with.

</p>

<p>

Markdown:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> [Text](http://example.com)
 [Text](http://example.com "Title")	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

Brackets or parentheses first? Why using different kind of markup characters in the first place like only brackets? Is the <code>Title</code> part of the URL? Why not part of <code>Text</code>? Very confusing design decisions from my point of view.

</p>

<p>

reStructuredText:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> `Text &lt;http://example.com/&gt;`_	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

Holy moly. This is some weird stuff. First, you have to grave accents <code>`</code> and not apostrophes <code>'</code>. Then what about the underscore character at the end? This is as complicated as you can define a simple URL. I'd even prefer the hard to type HTML version of linking. A disaster for something which has "lightweight" in its class name.

</p>

<p>

Even with the most basic formatting syntax, Markdown (I assume in all flavors of it) shows a high level of inconsistency:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> _italic_, **bold**, `monospace`, ~~strikethrough~~	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

Why is it that italic and monospace require only one character before and after the string in-between and others require two? It's …</p></article></div>

These are the first services available from Expo Application Services (EAS), our new cloud services.</p><h2 id="233e">Feature Preview</h2><p id="1abe">EAS Build is a new service that takes everything good about the Expo build service (<code>expo build:[ios|android]</code>) and makes it available to all React Native apps. You can set your app up to build for distribution in minutes or even less, thanks to <a href="https://docs.expo.io/app-signing/managed-credentials/" rel="noopener">automatically managed app signing credentials</a> and defaults that <em>just work</em> for most Expo and React Native apps.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Terminal window running EAS Build in order to configure a new project, generate a keystore, and start a build." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2304/1*Yfou6wa_fi05Ps8anXeJBA.png" width="1152" height="684" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*Yfou6wa_fi05Ps8anXeJBA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*Yfou6wa_fi05Ps8anXeJBA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*Yfou6wa_fi05Ps8anXeJBA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Yfou6wa_fi05Ps8anXeJBA.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Yfou6wa_fi05Ps8anXeJBA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>In this screenshot, we go from a brand new project to release build running on EAS Build in 30 seconds.</figcaption></figure><p id="83b0">We’ve also added support for “<a href="https://docs.expo.io/build/internal-distribution/" rel="noopener">internal distribution</a>” — a feature that makes it easy for you to share test builds with colleagues and friends without going through an app store, by using <a href="https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests/p/iosbuild-with-adhoc-provision-profile" rel="noopener">ad hoc provisioning</a> on iOS and standard APK side-loading on Android. Generating and updating the ad hoc provisioning profile can be handled entirely for you by EAS Build.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/7148/1*9sydz-IelPB7FDMBSgRpwg.png" width="3574" height="1018" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*9sydz-IelPB7FDMBSgRpwg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*9sydz-IelPB7FDMBSgRpwg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*9sydz-IelPB7FDMBSgRpwg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*9sydz-IelPB7FDMBSgRpwg.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*9sydz-IelPB7FDMBSgRpwg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Easily share builds with your team using “<a href="https://docs.expo.io/build/internal-distribution/" rel="noopener">internal distribution”</a>.</figcaption></figure><p id="2d9a">EAS Build <em>currently</em> works best with bare React Native apps. If you use the Expo managed workflow and end up needing to move to the bare workflow, you can transition seamlessly to EAS Build — just run <code>eas build</code> instead of <code>expo build</code> after ejecting.</p><h2 id="7c43">Coming later in 2021: full support for Expo managed workflow</h2><p id="608d">With EAS Build, you can include libraries with native code that aren’t part of the Expo standard library. For many of you, the Expo managed workflow is nearly a perfect fit — except for that one piece of functionality you absolutely have to have in your app, but that isn’t part of the Expo standard library (whether that’s <a href="https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests/p/in-app-purchases" rel="noopener">IAP</a> support, <a href="https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests/p/webrtc" rel="noopener">WebRTC</a>, <a href="https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests/p/bluetooth-api" rel="noopener">Bluetooth</a>, or something more <a href="https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests/p/data-over-sound" rel="noopener">esoteric</a>).</p><p id="9e41">EAS Build will let you use any compatible library from GitHub or npm or that you write yourself, even if it has native code in it.</p><p id="c8c2">EAS Build also lets you build smaller, stripped-down binaries that include only the code your application needs, which means <a href="https://github.com/expo/fyi/blob/master/managed-app-size.md" rel="noopener">a smaller install size for your users</a>.</p><p id="339b">There’s already early support for Expo managed apps in EAS Build in the preview, but it’s not quite ready for production yet. There’s also a big missing piece: how do you get a new version of your Expo development client app that includes your bespoke native runtime? We’re working on this, and we’ll have answers for you in the coming months.</p><p id="a288">These are some of the most common requests we hear from Expo developers today, so we’re extremely excited to be close to getting a solution into your hands.</p><h2 id="8c79">Feature Preview</h2><p id="40a1">When you want to put your app into the App Store and Play Store, you can use a single command from your terminal or from CI to submit it.</p><p id="c0ac">When you run <code>eas submit</code>, your app binary will be uploaded to EAS and then submitted to the respective app store from there. This means fewer dependencies to install on your machine, and that you can submit your apps from your Windows, Linux, or macOS computer to any app store.</p><p id="1d7c">We guide you through your first submission and try to make your <em>n</em>th submission as easy as possible by catching common mistakes and giving you guidance on how to resolve them. For example, if you’re missing a privacy policy, <a href="https://expo.fyi/missing-privacy-policy" rel="noopener">we have an FYI for that</a>.</p><p id="4905"><strong><em>Expo</em></strong> is the open source project, and <strong><em>Expo Application Services</em></strong> offers hosted cloud services built for both Expo and React Native.</p><p id="6d1f"><strong>You won’t need EAS to use Expo, </strong>which will always be open source and free. You can choose a different CI/CD service or use your own hardware.</p><p id="0569">Likewise, <strong>you’ll be able to take advantage of EAS with any React Native project, whether or not it uses Expo’s open source tools</strong>. EAS is designed for developers who specifically want their builds, updates and/or other parts of their app operations, development and collaboration workflows streamlined by a cloud service designed purposefully for and deeply integrated with React Native and Expo.</p><p id="ea39">We don’t want to disrupt anyone who is counting on Expo services to make software, and so we’ll continue to operate the existing build, update, and notification services indefinitely. So, if you’re happy with the way you’re using those services now, you don’t need to do anything differently and you can continue using them.</p><p id="84cc">To reduce confusion with EAS versions of the services, we’re going to start calling the existing free services the “Classic” Expo services. So, “Classic” Build, Updates, and Notifications.</p><p id="a6f7">That said, EAS is where most of our investment and effort on the services side will go in the future, so you should expect to see each EAS service keep getting better, more powerful, and easier to use as time goes on. Keep an eye out for the EAS Update preview, launching in early 2021.</p><p id="c6cd">We’ll always maintain a free tier that can meet the needs of individual and hobbyist developers building small apps. We’ll announce further pricing details closer to the date when EAS services graduate from preview in 2021.</p><p id="be36">If you’re currently paying for Expo Developer Services, we’ve automatically updated your plan to EAS Priority Plan. EAS Priority will have the same price point and feature set as your old Developer Services plan, plus preview access to EAS Build and Submit. You don’t need to do anything: you’ll be moved over automatically.</p><p id="7bc9">The previews of EAS Build and Submit are available to developers subscribed to the <a href="https://expo.io/pricing" rel="noopener">EAS Priority Plan</a>. If you’re not yet a subscriber, <a href="https://expo.io/pricing" rel="noopener">you can try it out for free for a month</a>. If you want to try the preview services out but don’t have access to a credit card, please reach out to us <a href="https://www.twitter.com/expo" rel="noopener">on Twitter</a> and we can help you out.</p><p id="9298">Once you’re signed up, you can find everything that you need to know in the <a href="https://docs.expo.io/eas" rel="noopener">Feature Preview documentation</a>.

And when you’re
building user interfaces, things can get very complicated – e.g., show a pop-up
every other Monday between Midnight UTC+5:30 and Noon UTC+12:45 to trial
customers born on a Leap Year.</p><p>In this post, I’m going tell you a story about how I lost my cool trying to
build and test 50 different UI states and how decision tables saved my project.
By the end of this post, you’ll have a problem solving tool that is
generalizable across other programming domains besides UI programming.</p><h4 id="what-are-decision-tables">What Are Decision Tables?</h4><p>Decision tables are a visual way to map conditions to outcomes in a tabular
format. Organizing information in a tabular format is nothing new. For example,
Boolean Algebra uses truth tables to map inputs to outputs for logical
operations such as AND and OR.</p><table><thead><tr><th><code>AND (&amp;&amp;)</code></th><th>False</th><th>True</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>False</strong></td><td>False</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><td><strong>True</strong></td><td>False</td><td>True</td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th><code>OR (||)</code></th><th>False</th><th>True</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>False</strong></td><td>False</td><td>True</td></tr><tr><td><strong>True</strong></td><td>True</td><td>True</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Since it’s just a table, you get all of the benefits associated with organizing
your information in a tabular format.</p><ul><li>Missing outcomes are visibly obvious so you’re forced to immediately address
any gaps in your logic and ensure that you’ve considered every case.</li><li>They can be used as a design document when communicating with your peers; a
reference when you’re writing code; and a complete specification when you’re
testing code.</li></ul><h4 id="the-setup">The Setup</h4><p>This story took place at a SaaS startup that helped its customers collect and
manage product feedback. They also had a Machine Learning algorithm that could
automatically categorize feedback by topic and sentiment. For example, the
feedback “Constant rendering issues” would be tagged with “BUGS” and given a
negative sentiment by the ML algorithm. Customers could also create their own
tags to match specific words and phrases. These were called text match tags.</p><p>I was teamed up with a designer and a backend engineer to add 2 checkboxes to
the UI which would allow customers to add tighter constraints to their text
match tags. The goal of this feature was to improve the results of text match
tags by letting customers define rules around how their tags would be applied to
feedback. These 2 checkboxes would allow text match tags to be aware of more
information like feedback metadata such as filters and the tags that were
applied by the ML algorithm.</p><p><a href="https://hachibu.net/posts/2020/building-and-testing-50-ui-states-with-decision-tables/images/ui-screenshot.png"><img src="https://hachibu.net/posts/2020/building-and-testing-50-ui-states-with-decision-tables/images/ui-screenshot.png"></a></p><h4 id="the-confrontation">The Confrontation</h4><p>This project appeared to be straight-forward. I just had to build and connect 2
checkboxes. What could be easier? So, I just started coding, and I opened a pull
request for code review shortly thereafter. It wasn’t until I entered QA testing
in our staging environment that my troubles began.</p><p>Every time my code got reviewed, my teammates would keep finding new bugs and
regressions. This went on for days as I attempted to brute-force my way through
the project. I knew that I didn’t have a complete understanding of what I was
supposed to be building, but I soldiered on out of desperation.</p><p>My frustration was growing, and I could sense that I was approaching my limit.
So, I put the project on pause so I could sleep on it. After sleeping on it, I
came to the realization that there were too many states for me to keep track of.
I would need to write down and enumerate every single state so that I could
confidently implement and test this feature.</p><p>Each hide or show decision relied on the value of 2 variables: the parent tag
mode and the child tag mode. This reminded me of something I had studied years
ago while implementing logic gate functions: Boolean Algebra Truth Tables. With
truth tables in mind, I eventually stumbled upon decision tables. Working
together with the backend engineer for this project, we created the following
decision tables.</p><p><a href="https://hachibu.net/posts/2020/building-and-testing-50-ui-states-with-decision-tables/images/spreadsheet-1.png"><img src="https://hachibu.net/posts/2020/building-and-testing-50-ui-states-with-decision-tables/images/spreadsheet-1.png"></a>
<a href="https://hachibu.net/posts/2020/building-and-testing-50-ui-states-with-decision-tables/images/spreadsheet-2.png"><img src="https://hachibu.net/posts/2020/building-and-testing-50-ui-states-with-decision-tables/images/spreadsheet-2.png"></a></p><p>Once we finished the decision tables, I breathed a sigh of relief because all of
the logic was now crystal clear. But I was also shocked to discover that this
seemingly simple feature had 50 different UI states. A parent tag has 5 options,
and a child tag has 5 options. So each checkbox has 5 * 5 combinations: 25
states. And with 2 checkboxes, that’s 25 + 25 combinations: 50 total states.</p><h4 id="the-resolution">The Resolution</h4><p>I was finally ready to start programming but first I would need to decide how to
translate a decision table into a data structure. Building your programs around
well designed data structures is very important, which reminds me of a quote by
Linus Torvalds (the creator of Linux and Git).</p><blockquote><p>git actually has a simple design, with stable and reasonably well-documented
data structures. In fact, I'm a huge proponent of designing your code around
the data, rather than the other way around, and I think it's one of the
reasons git has been fairly successful […] I will, in fact, claim that the
difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his
code or his data structures more important.</p></blockquote><p>What kind of data structure could represent a table? Given that a table is
comprised of rows and columns, it seemed obvious to use a 2-dimensional data
structure like an array of arrays or a map of maps.</p><p>I chose a map of maps, because it would allow me to get my answer quickly by
2-dimensionally indexing on parent tag mode and child tag mode. The outer map
would represent the rows which are the parent tag modes; the inner map would
represent the columns which are the child tag modes; and the cells would
represent the hide or show decision as a boolean.</p><p>The following code is written in TypeScript which should seem familiar to you
if you’ve written JavaScript before. That’s because the syntax of TypeScript and
JavaScript are closely related. The biggest difference between TypeScript and
JavaScript is that the former layers additional syntax for types on top of the
latter.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="typescript"><span>type</span> <span>TagMode</span> <span>=</span> <span>'none'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'manual'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'text_match'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'smart'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'managed'</span>

</code></pre></div><p>After adding those functions to the AngularJS controller for that page, all I
had to do was bind those functions to the HTML view. For that, AngularJS has a
built-in directive called <code>ng-show</code> which shows or hides an HTML element based

deployed to production later that day.</p><p>Lastly, I think it’s worth mentioning that while finalizing this post months
after writing the original code, I realized that I could have written these two

don’t know which solution I prefer; I could make arguments for and against each
one, but that’s beyond the scope of this post.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="typescript"><span>function</span> <span>showUseFeedbackFilters</span><span>(</span><span>parent</span>: <span>Tag</span><span>,</span> <span>child</span>: <span>Tag</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>boolean</span> <span>{</span>

</code></pre></div><h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4><p>I wish I had known about decision tables earlier in my career. I’m a visual
learner and thinker and being able to visually map out states into a table would
have helped me out so much in the past. When you enumerate the states of your
program into a table, the logic becomes obvious and it can also be validated by
anyone on your team because tables are everywhere in daily life.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>The most productive and jelled teams I’ve seen tend to be the noisiest. The Slack channels for those teams are chaos.</p>



<p>The teams I’ve seen with the worst morale tend to be quiet. People on those teams don’t talk to each other often. They <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/17/zombie-standups-try-walking-the-board/">rattle off a standup update</a>, and they ask for help when they get blocked on something, and that’s it.</p>



<p>The book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33517721-the-culture-code">The Culture Code</a> talks about a team’s “notification rate” in the context of airline pilots:</p>



<blockquote><p>The term pilots use to describe this type of short-burst communication is notifications. A notification is not an order or a command. It provides context, telling of something noticed, placing a spotlight on one discrete element of the world. </p><p>Notifications are the humblest and most primitive form of communication, the equivalent of a child’s finger-point: I see this. </p><p>Unlike commands, they carry unspoken questions: Do you agree? What else do you see? In a typical landing or takeoff, a proficient crew averages twenty notifications per minute.</p><cite>Daniel Coyle, The Culture Code</cite></blockquote>



<p>I love the simplicity: <em>you just say stuff</em>. Throw your random thoughts and observations in the chat room. You don’t have to filter out the stuff that isn’t useful to anyone else. Who are you to decide that anyway? You’re increasing the notification rate of the team, and that’s all the reason you need.</p>



<p>This is powerful in 2 ways:</p>



<p><strong>#1: It increases the possibility of <em>serendipitous moments</em>.</strong> Your coworker sees you’re working on X and says “Oh I looked into X last week and I noticed Y!” Or the reverse: you start working on X and you think “wait a second, didn’t someone say something about X in the chat last week?” </p>



<p>Standup is meant to do that kind of thing, but summarizing 8 hours of work into a 15 second update doesn’t provide enough granularity.</p>



<p><strong>#2: It makes a team feel more like a <em>team</em>.</strong> A team that doesn’t talk to each other <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/14/are-we-actually-a-team/">isn’t a team</a>. Constant communication helps teams become <em>teams</em> instead of some people who happen to be working from the same kanban board. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/10/death-to-just-add-water-team-jelling/">Trust is built slowly and steadily</a> and increasing notification rates help a lot.</p>



<p>I can hear you now: “<em>But that will be <a href="https://critter.blog/2019/09/05/the-chatodoro-breaking-the-group-chat-addiction/">so distracting</a>! People won’t get any work done! Important messages will be lost!</em>” </p>



<p>Instead of thinking of all the reasons why it will fail, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/26/you-cant-fail-at-experiments/">try it out</a>. Take a team that doesn’t feel much like a team, and encourage everyone to start saying more. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/12/stop-changing-start-experimenting/">Make it an experiment</a>, and lead by example. Keep it up for a couple months and see if people feel more comfortable and honest and vulnerable. See if the team feels more like a <em>team</em>.</p>

<p>Postgres allows you to define custom data types when the default types provided don't fit your needs. There are many situations where these custom data types come in handy.</p>
<p>For example, if you have multiple columns in several tables that should be an <code>int</code> between 0 and 255, you could use a custom data type so that you only have to define the constraints once. Or, if you have complex data - like metadata about a file - and you want to save it to a single column instead of spreading it across several, custom data types can help.</p>

<p>No matter how you decide to define your datatype, Django has the functionality to allow you to map custom column data to model attributes. You can achieve this by extending the Django <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.Field">field class</a>. In this walkthrough, we'll see <strong>how to create custom types in Postgres</strong> and then use them in Django to <strong>ensure consistent data types across your application</strong>. We will do this by walking you through an <a href="https://github.com/pganalyze-resources/django-custom-data-types-example">example project</a>.</p>
<h2 id="custom-domains-in-postgres"><a href="#custom-domains-in-postgres" aria-label="custom domains in postgres permalink"></a>Custom Domains in Postgres</h2>
<p>There are several different kinds of custom data types in Postgres, including <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/datatype-enum.html">enums</a> and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/rangetypes.html">range types</a>. The two we’ll use in our project today are called domain types and composite types. </p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, let’s take a look at <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createdomain.html">domain types</a>. Domains are a way of adding restrictions to an existing type so that it can be reused in columns across tables. They are particularly useful for columns like email addresses, phone numbers, or <a href="https://postgis.net/docs/stdaddr.html">street addresses</a>, where you might find yourself repeating the same checks over and over. A custom domain allows you to define those checks once and then reuse them making them easier to manage and maintain.</p>
<p>For our example project, we'll start by creating a custom data type that performs a check to ensure a string doesn't contain any spaces:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> DOMAIN string_no_spaces <span>as</span> <span>VARCHAR</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>CHECK</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span> <span>!</span><span>~</span> <span>'\s'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can use this type on as many tables or in as many columns as we like. For example say we don’t want to allow spaces in user_names for a chat app:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> users <span>(</span>
  id <span>serial</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span><span>,</span> 
 user_name string_no_spaces
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now if you try to add a value with a space, Postgres will throw an error:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>INSERT INTO users(user_name) VALUES ('I am a      bad user name');
-- ERROR:  value for domain string_no_spaces violates check constraint "string_no_spaces_check"</code></pre></div>
<p>We can also reuse this domain in the definition of another domain. For example: </p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> DOMAIN email_with_check <span>AS</span> string_no_spaces <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>CHECK</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span> <span>~</span> <span>'@'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> email_addresses <span>(</span>
  user_id <span>integer</span><span>,</span>
  email email_with_check
<span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> email_addresses<span>(</span>email<span>)</span> <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'josh @gmail.com'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>


<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> email_addresses<span>(</span>email<span>)</span> <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'joshgmail.com'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, we've created a new check to ensure an email contains <code>@</code> and we've used <code>string_no_spaces</code> as our base type. This allows us to inherit the no spaces check. Now data of datatype <code>email_with_check</code> must contain <code>@</code> and cannot contain spaces.</p>
<h2 id="composite-types-in-postgres"><a href="#composite-types-in-postgres" aria-label="composite types in postgres permalink"></a>Composite Types in Postgres</h2>
<p>The <strong>second</strong> kind of custom data type we’ll look at today is called a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtype.html">composite type</a>. A composite type is essentially a group of data that can be held in a single column. Composite types can be helpful if you have lists of data that you don't want to be spread over multiple columns. Perhaps this data only makes sense when grouped together like the <a href="https://til.hashrocket.com/posts/3693c7fc13-creating-custom-types-in-postgresql">dimensions of a package</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model">RGB color data</a> is another good example because it doesn't make much sense on its own - 255 is just an <code>int</code> - but coupled with some labels and two other numbers (<code>red: 255, green: 0, blue: 0</code>), it becomes the color red. Every time we access a color, we'll want to have all three of these values returned, so it saves us from having to query multiple columns for a group of data that is only meaningful when combined.</p>
<p>Let's start by creating a new RGB color value type:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>TYPE</span> rgb_color_value <span>as</span> <span>(</span>
  red <span>integer</span><span>,</span>
  green <span>integer</span><span>,</span>
  blue <span>integer</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we can create a new table and use both our domain and custom data type for the columns:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> colors <span>(</span>
  name string_no_spaces<span>,</span>
  rgb rgb_color_value
<span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> colors<span>(</span>name<span>,</span> rgb<span>)</span> <span>VALUES</span><span>(</span><span>'pink'</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>252</span><span>,</span><span>15</span><span>,</span><span>192</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> colors<span>;</span>

 name <span>|</span> rgb   

 pink <span>|</span> <span>(</span><span>252</span><span>,</span><span>15</span><span>,</span><span>192</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can even access the individual values. For example, if all we want is the green value:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>(</span>rgb<span>)</span><span>.</span>green <span>FROM</span> colors<span>;</span>

  green 
 
   <span>15</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="custom-types-in-django"><a href="#custom-types-in-django" aria-label="custom types in django permalink"></a>Custom Types in Django</h2>
<p>Let's use our <code>string_no_spaces</code> domain and our <code>rgb_color_value</code> composite type to create a Django model to define a color. <code>rgb_color_value</code> is going to take the most work, so we'll start there and then come back to <code>string_no_spaces</code>.</p>
<h3 id="registering-a-type-with-psycopg2"><a href="#registering-a-type-with-psycopg2" aria-label="registering a type with psycopg2 permalink"></a>Registering a type with psycopg2</h3>
<p>We'll use the <a href="https://www.psycopg.org/docs/">pyscopg2</a> database adapter in this example. I won't go into how to set it up here, but I recommend <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-postgresql-with-your-django-application-on-ubuntu-14-04">this tutorial</a>. It does a good job covering the setup if you aren't familiar with it yet.</p>
<p>We'll need to start by <a href="https://www.psycopg.org/docs/extensions.html#psycopg2.extensions.register_adapter">registering and creating an adapter</a> for our new type so that psycopg2 knows how to handle it. After we register it, psycopg will return values from the database as a named tuple.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> django<span>.</span>db <span>import</span> connection
<span>from</span> psycopg2<span>.</span>extras <span>import</span> register_composite

Rgb <span>=</span> register_composite<span>(</span>
  <span>'rgb_color_value'</span><span>,</span>
  connection<span>.</span>cursor<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>cursor<span>,</span>
  globally<span>=</span><span>True</span>
<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>type</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above code will handle data coming to our app from the database, but <strong>we'll also need to tell psycopg what to do with data sent to the database</strong>. That's where the adapter comes in:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> django<span>.</span>db <span>import</span> connection
<span>from</span> psycopg2<span>.</span>extras <span>import</span> register_composite
<span>from</span> psycopg2<span>.</span>extensions <span>import</span> register_adapter<span>,</span> adapt<span>,</span> AsIs

Rgb <span>=</span> register_composite<span>(</span>
  <span>'rgb_color_value'</span><span>,</span>
  connection<span>.</span>cursor<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>cursor<span>,</span>
  globally<span>=</span><span>True</span>
<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>type</span>

<span>def</span> <span>rgb_adapter</span><span>(</span>value<span>)</span><span>:</span>
  <span>return</span> AsIs<span>(</span><span>"(%s, %s, %s)::rgb_color_value"</span> <span>%</span> <span>(</span>
    adapt<span>(</span>value<span>.</span>red<span>)</span><span>.</span>getquoted<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    adapt<span>(</span>value<span>.</span>green<span>)</span><span>.</span>getquoted<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    adapt<span>(</span>value<span>.</span>blue<span>)</span><span>.</span>getquoted<span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span><span>)</span>

register_adapter<span>(</span>Rgb<span>,</span> rgb_adapter<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now that psycopg knows about our new data type and how to handle it, we can create the same functionality for Django. </p>

<p>We want to be able to do things with our objects like this: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>rgb <span>=</span> Rgb<span>(</span><span>255</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>

my_color_object<span>.</span>rgb <span>=</span> rgb 

my_color_object<span>.</span>save<span>(</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To do that, we'll need to start with a Python class that represents an RGB value.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Rgb</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> red<span>,</span> green<span>,</span> blue<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        self<span>.</span>red <span>=</span> red
        self<span>.</span>green <span>=</span> green
        self<span>.</span>blue <span>=</span> blue</code></pre></div>
<p>We'll come back to this class in a bit, but first, we need to talk about fields.</p>
<h3 id="using-django-fields"><a href="#using-django-fields" aria-label="using django fields permalink"></a>Using Django fields</h3>
<p>You are probably familiar with many of <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/fields/">Django's built-in model fields</a> like <code>models.CharField</code> or <code>models.IntegerField</code>. You've also probably noticed that many of these fields correspond to data types we often use in Postgres (<code>varchar</code>, <code>int</code> etc.). </p>
<p>For custom data types, Django allows us to create our fields and then use them in our models:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> django<span>.</span>db <span>import</span> models

<span>class</span> <span>RgbField</span><span>(</span>models<span>.</span>Field<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    
    <span>def</span> <span>db_type</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> connection<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>'rgb_color_value'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>All custom fields inherit from <code>models.Field</code>. You can also inherit from existing fields like <code>models.CharField</code> (which itself inherits from <code>models.Field</code>) This is helpful if your custom type behaves similarly to an existing type. Since ours doesn't, we'll inherit directly from <code>models.Field</code>. </p>
<p>Next, we need to override <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/howto/custom-model-fields/#converting-values-to-python-objects">three methods</a> so that they will return instances of our <code>Rgb</code> class. The first, <code>from_db_value()</code> is called when data is loaded from the database. This is the method that will receive our named tuple we set up with Psycopg earlier. The second, <code>to_python()</code> gets called during deserialization. These two need to return an instance of the <code>Rgb</code> class. </p>
<p>The last method we need to override is <code>get_prep_value</code>, where we'll convert our <code>Rgb</code> object back into a tuple before handing it off to Psycopg to save to the database. When we're done, our field class should look like this:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>RgbField</span><span>(</span>models<span>.</span>Field<span>)</span><span>:</span>
  
  <span>def</span> <span>from_db_value</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> value<span>,</span> expression<span>,</span> connection<span>)</span><span>:</span>
      <span>if</span> value <span>is</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
          <span>return</span> value
      <span>return</span> Rgb<span>(</span>value<span>.</span>red<span>,</span> value<span>.</span>green<span>,</span> value<span>.</span>blue<span>)</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>to_python</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span>value<span>,</span> Rgb<span>)</span><span>:</span>
          <span>return</span> value

      <span>if</span> value <span>is</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
          <span>return</span> value

      <span>return</span> Rgb<span>(</span>value<span>.</span>red<span>,</span> value<span>.</span>green<span>,</span> value<span>.</span>blue<span>)</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>get_prep_value</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> value<span>)</span><span>:</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>(</span>value<span>.</span>red<span>,</span> value<span>.</span>green<span>,</span> value<span>.</span>blue<span>)</span>
  
  <span>def</span> <span>db_type</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> connection<span>)</span><span>:</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>'rgb_color_value'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The checks I put in place above are suggestions from the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/howto/custom-model-fields/#converting-values-to-python-objects">Django docs</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, we can create our model using our brand new Rgb field:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Color</span><span>(</span>models<span>.</span>Model<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    rgb <span>=</span> RgbField<span>(</span><span>)</span>
    name <span>=</span> models<span>.</span>CharField<span>(</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But wait! Didn't we create a special <code>string_no_spaces</code> domain that we want to use for the <code>name</code> attribute?</p>
<p>Since this type is just a string with checks at the database level, all we need to do is create the field with the appropriate <code>db_type</code> method:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>StringNoSpacesField</span><span>(</span>models<span>.</span>Field<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    
    <span>def</span> <span>db_type</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> connection<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>'string_no_spaces'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can update our model and run our migrations:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Color</span><span>(</span>models<span>.</span>Model<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    rgb <span>=</span> RgbField<span>(</span><span>)</span>
    name <span>=</span> StringNoSpacesField<span>(</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let's confirm that everything is working as expected. In the python shell (I'm using <a href="https://django-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shell_plus.html">shell plus</a>), we'll create a new color:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> from colors.models <span>import</span> Rgb
<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> rgb <span>=</span> Rgb<span>(</span><span>255</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> c <span>=</span> Color.objects.create<span>(</span>name<span>=</span><span>'red'</span>, <span>rgb</span><span>=</span>rgb<span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> c.rgb
<span>&lt;</span>colors.models.Rgb object at 0x104e3d6d<span><span>8</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> c.rgb.red
<span>255</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you try to create a color with a name that has a space in it, you will get an error like this: </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>django.db.utils.IntegrityError: value for domain string_no_spaces violates check constraint "string_no_spaces_check"</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, let's check the database and make sure everything got saved as the correct type:</p>
<div data-language="psql"><pre><code>customdt=# SELECT pg_typeof(rgb), pg_typeof(name) FROM colors_color;
    pg_typeof | pg_typeof     
-----------------+------------------
 rgb_color_value | string_no_spaces
(1 row)</code></pre></div>
<p>From here, we could ensure that only numbers from 0 - 255 are entered by <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/howto/custom-model-fields/#writing-a-field-subclass">overriding the __ init __ </a> method and adding checks at the Postgres level. We could also create a new type for storing the hex code for …</p></div></div></div>

</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about task management lately. I’ve actually been
thinking about it for years. I’ve always been searching for the optimal way to
sort through the bajillion things I have to do and remain productive.</p>

<p>This all started when, as a programmer, I realized that I had the power to
automate the tasks that I found repetitive in my digital life. I would write
scripts, for example, to do things like organize my photos, clean up my music
library, and back up my data. Over the years, I’ve developed my own homegrown
approach to task management, which has included a couple of attempts at writing
a command-line tool to manage my tasks in a way that’s in line with my approach.
Then, recently, I discovered that there is already a robust command-line tool
that does exactly what I need.</p>

<p>That tool is <a href="https://taskwarrior.org/">Taskwarrior</a>. But before I get into it, here’s a
brief dive into the journey that led me to using it.</p>



<p>Around the same time that I was starting to write scripts to automate the
monotonous parts of my day-to-day life, I was also discovering the joy of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=inbox+zero">Inbox
Zero</a>. If you’re unfamiliar with Inbox Zero, the basic idea is that
you endeavor to keep your email inbox empty as much as possible, instead of
letting emails pile up that you’ll get to “later” (which could be days, months,
or even years from now, or perhaps never). You can achieve Inbox Zero by being
disciplined about reviewing your inbox regularly (at least once a day) and
taking action on every email. Taking action on an email can mean deleting or
archiving it, replying (even if a quick reply is all you have time for), or
perhaps making a note for yourself on your calendar to do something later.</p>

<p>(You might be wondering what Inbox Zero has to do with task management. That
will become clear very shortly. Read on!)</p>



<p>Sometime around 2013, I discovered an excellent, free service called
<a href="https://followupthen.com/">FollowUpThen</a>. The elevator pitch for FollowUpThen is that you can send or
forward an email to an address like <code>tomorrow@followupthen.com</code> (or
<code>tomorrow@fut.io</code>, for short) and tomorrow at 6 AM, the email that you sent or
forwarded will arrive in your inbox, like clockwork. FollowUpThen supports a
<a href="https://www.followupthen.com/how#timeformats">wide variety</a> of time and date formats, many of which are highly
useful. I often found myself forwarding an email to <code>2weeks@fut.io</code> or sending
an email to <code>september@fut.io</code>, for example.</p>

<p>FollowUpThen quickly became the primary tool in my Inbox Zero toolbox. If I had
a lot of work to do and a handful of emails that I just didn’t have time for at
the moment, I could use FollowUpThen to “snooze” the emails until a particular
time later in the day when I knew I would be more available.</p>

<p>I also started to use FollowUpThen as a task manager. For example, if I was
planning to mow the lawn on Saturday, I would send an email with the subject
<code>mow the lawn</code> to <code>saturday@fut.io</code>. Then when Saturday rolled around, I would
get an email with the subject <code>mow the lawn</code>, and I would have to mow the lawn
in order to reach Inbox Zero, which motivated me to mow the lawn.</p>

<p>After a while, I started wishing that I could see my upcoming tasks ahead of
time. I wanted to see into the future just slightly, so that I could mentally
prepare myself to work on a task that wasn’t due yet. This would be better than
forgetting that I had a task scheduled, and then <em>BAM</em> – I get an email,
signaling that I needed to do it right now!</p>

<p>Now, to be fair, you <em>can</em> see all of your scheduled follow-ups by logging in at
followupthen.com – and I did that from time to time – but that’s a little
cumbersome for something that I’d ideally like to do on a regular basis. Over
time, I’ve become more and more accustomed to doing things at the command line.
I’m already in a terminal most of the time, so it is typically a lot faster for
me to do something at the command-line as opposed to, say, logging into a
website, navigating to the right page, and clicking a button. I started pining
for a way to manage all of my projects and tasks at the command-line.</p>



<p>As I imagined an ideal command-line task management workflow, I found myself
thinking about the ancient AS400 system that I used in my previous life as a
claims adjudicator.</p>

<p>I was managing a caseload of anywhere from 50 to 200 claims, each of which had a
log of past actions (called <em>log items</em>) and a schedule of upcoming actions
needed (called <em>action items</em>). Some of the action items were designated <code>IA</code>,
which meant that Immediate Action was needed. This was really just a way of
designating some action items as being higher priority than others.</p>

<p>The best part of the system was the case summary screen. This was a top-level
summary of all of my cases, with statistics about how many cases fell into
certain categories.  For example, there was a “Cases needing immediate action”
category, which displayed the number of cases with Immediate Action follow-up
actions either due or overdue. There were also useful categories like “Cases
without action in 30 days.” When I was working at that job, I developed a highly
productive workflow in which I was able to effectively manage large caseloads
and ensure that the most urgent tasks were done first. My daily process was to
go through the categories on the case summary screen in priority order, and
endeavor to get the number to the right of each category down to zero, over
time. I was following the Inbox Zero philosophy with my workload, and it worked
very well for me.</p>

<p>I wanted to replicate this sort of workflow for day-to-day task management in my
personal life. So, I started writing a program that I called <a href="https://github.com/daveyarwood/ews"><code>ews</code></a> (named
after the Electronic Worksheet System that I had used in my past job). I was
envisioning <code>ews</code> as essentially a port of the AS400 system I had used, where
“cases” (i.e. projects, groups of related tasks) could be managed and summarized
in priority order.</p>

<p>I started writing this tool in <a href="https://clojurescript.org/">ClojureScript</a> targeting
<a href="https://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>, but I got frustrated with the need to use callbacks when
interfacing with the node.js ecosystem, which was a show-stopper for me. I was
playing with <a href="https://rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> at the time, so I did a basic rewrite in Rust, which I
was fairly happy with, although I realized that the strictness of the Rust
compiler caused me to work more slowly than I do in less strict languages.</p>

<p>I was on the verge of yet another rewrite in <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a> when I finally
took a step back and thought about what I really wanted to create. This led me
to my next iteration, which was different enough that I decided to give it a
different name.</p>



<p>I had a shower-thought that Google Calendar provides a database for events and
an API for interacting with them, so I could leverage this platform to build my
tool. So, I started writing <a href="https://github.com/daveyarwood/tdz">tdz</a> as an experiment in that direction. (NB:
I didn’t get very far, so don’t expect to find much in that repo!)</p>

<p>While I was thinking about how my mental model of projects and tasks could map
onto the Google Calendar API, I also realized that the model could be
simplified. I didn’t really need to manage projects; I only needed to manage
individual tasks that have scheduled dates and due dates. (If I could organize
them into projects, that would be icing on the cake, but it wasn’t a
requirement.)</p>

<p>With the conceptual model simplified to just tasks, I (finally) started to
wonder if maybe somebody else had already created something like this. After
some googling, I stumbled upon <a href="https://stackify.com/top-command-line-tools/">this list of useful command-line
tools</a>, which included Taskwarrior, a feature-rich task
management application. So, I decided to give it a try.</p>



<p>I’d briefly encountered Taskwarrior before in the past and thought, “This is
cool, but how is it different from the other command-line TODO apps I’ve seen?”
I’d dismissed it as “just another TODO list app.”</p>

<p>At that point, I’d already come across a number of command-line TODO list
managers in the open source space; it’s a fun, easy project that any beginning
programmer can build and get working in a short amount of time. So, by
association, I had come to expect any command-line TODO manager to be simplistic
and fall short of my task management needs.</p>

<p>I didn’t want a tool that would simply keep track of a list of tasks and let me
check them off when I did them.  This is akin to a traditional pen-and-paper
TODO list; I’ve always hated those because there’s no way to assign dates to
things and filter out the noise of backlog tasks that aren’t yet ready for
action.  It didn’t occur to me that there might be a more sophisticated task
management CLI tool that had all of the features I needed in order to follow an
“Inbox Zero” style of task management. Taskwarrior turned out to be exactly what
I needed and more!</p>

<h2 id="tasks-projects-and-urgency">Tasks, Projects, and Urgency</h2>

<p>Adding and listing tasks is, of course, a breeze:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">$ task add mow the lawn
Created task 1.

$ task
[task next]

ID Age Description  Urg
 1 5s  mow the lawn    0

1 task</code></pre></figure>

<p>The default behavior when you run <code>task</code> is to run the command <code>task next</code>,
which lists your most urgent tasks, sorted by urgency.</p>

<p>Tasks can be modified in a number of ways, including, but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adding tags.</li>
  <li>Categorizing the task as being part of a project.</li>
  <li>Setting the dates/times when the task will be visible, scheduled, and due.</li>
  <li>Assigning a priority (the default priorities are L, M, and H, and you can
customize or replace them or add more priorities).</li>
  <li>Marking the task as “active” (i.e. you’ve started working on it).</li>
</ul>

<p>Watch what happens to my task when I designate it as part of the “home” project:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">$ task 1 modify project:home
Modifying task 1 'mow the lawn'.
Modified 1 task.
The project 'home' has changed.  Project 'home' is 0% complete (1 task remaining).

$ task
[task next]

ID Age  Project Description  Urg
 1 2min home    mow the lawn    1

1 task</code></pre></figure>

<p>Notice that the urgency level changed from 0 to 1! We can see why if we view
information about the task:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">$ task 1
No command specified - assuming 'information'.

Name          Value
ID            1

While we built a low-barrier content creation platform for the general public on ScrollStack, we were itching to create content tools for <em>us</em>, i.e, people from the tech community. </p><h3>Introducing the Code block! 😎</h3><p>Notice the newly added "<strong>&lt;</strong>/<strong>&gt;</strong>" button to the block options fly-out? </p><figure><picture><source srcset="https://s03.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/sites/9/posts/2959/qegbuvkgaw1607493119.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://s03.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/sites/9/posts/2959/qegbuvkgaw1607493119.png" type="image/png"><img src="https://s03.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/sites/9/posts/2959/qegbuvkgaw1607493119.png"></picture><figcaption>The Code block button in the block options fly-out.</figcaption></figure><p>Based on an excellent open-source <a href="https://highlightjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">highlight.js</a> library, the new ScrollStack Code block auto-detects programming language and applies appropriate syntax highlighting to it. This new block supports a wide range of programming languages and also beautifully renders it. Awesome, no? We think so too! ☺️</p><p>Here are some real examples of how the code block can be used in your ScrollStack posts.</p><h5>Python</h5><div><pre><code data-lang="python">#!/usr/bin/env python3
import antigravity

def main():
    antigravity.fly()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()</code></pre></div><h5>Javascript</h5><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript">// Tail Call optimization
function fib(n, a=1, b=0) {
  if (n === 0) {
    return b;
  } else {
    return fib(n-1, b, a+b);
  }
}

// ES6 Tail Call optimization
const fib = (n, a = 1, b = 0) =&gt; (n === 0) ? b : fib(n - 1, a + b, a);


fib(10); // 55</code></pre></div><h5>CSS</h5><div><pre><code data-lang="css">a:link, a:visited, a:hover, a:active {
background-color: green;
color: white;
padding: 10px 25px;
text-align: center;
text-decoration: none;
display: inline-block;
}</code></pre></div><h5>TypeScript</h5><div><pre><code data-lang="typescript">interface User {
  name: string;
  id: number;
}

class UserAccount {
  name: string;
  id: number;

  constructor(name: string, id: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.id = id;
  }
}

const user: User = new UserAccount("Murphy", 1);</code></pre></div><h3>Inline Code mark</h3><p>Inserting <code>inline code</code> is simple and intuitive. The text marked with backtick ' characters  is treated as inline code. </p><p><em>Quick tip</em>: If the code <code>marked word</code> has &lt;underscore&gt; at the beginning and end, hit backspace/delete after you complete typing the word. <br>For example, to mark the word <code>__init__</code>, one has to type <code>&lt;backtick&gt;__init__&lt;backspace/delete&gt;&lt;backtick&gt;</code></p><h3>External embed support  </h3><h5><strong>Github GIST</strong></h5><p>FYI, if you haven't reserved your subdomain on ScrollStack yet, you can <a href="https://scrollstack.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">do it here</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Introduction</h2><p>The subject of Artificial Intelligence piques my interest and I’m constantly studying and trying new things in this field.</p><p>It is notorious how the technologies related to Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and such have emerged and evolved into solutions used by millions of users every day.</p><p>Even though people use the term "Artificial Intelligence", we are still far away from something as advanced as a Skynet from the Terminator movies.</p><p>The most common subfield of AI used today is the one called Machine Learning, which, in its turn, has Deep Learning as subfield steeply growing every day for quite some time now.</p><p>In this guide, I aim to describe a path to follow for software engineers to begin understanding how Machine Learning works and how to apply it to your projects.</p><p>Yeah, you can just go to Google API’s or Amazon and pick some magical API to do Speech Recognition for you, but the value of knowing how it works, why it works and even more, how to make your own API as a Service and tune it to your specific needs is incredible.</p><p>Remember, as a developer, every tool is a new power.</p><p>I’ve read, watched and gone through all these resources until the end, even got a paid certification for some, even though it is not necessary to learn, I find myself more engaged to finish when I have some deadline and assessment to prove I actually learned the material.</p><p>Let’s dive into the topics.</p><p>Python is the main language these days when working with Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.</p><p>If you need a crash course on Python, here is your guide: <a href="https://renanmf.com/the-python-guide-for-beginners/">The Python Guide for Beginners</a>.</p><h2>The Basics: Math!</h2><p>Maybe you never had the chance to study some college-level math, or you did study it but you can’t remember most of the stuff because JavaScript and CSS took all the memory of those topics away.</p><p>There are 3 topics you must know beforehand, or at least have a decent grasp of to follow any good material on ML and DL: Linear Algebra, Calculus and Statistics.</p><p>If you’d like to go deep in learning the math needed to ML and DL, you can look for MIT OpenCourseWare classes like Professor Strang’s renowned <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/">Linear Algebra</a> class.</p><p>I’ve watched it in college in parallel with my regular class and it is very good.</p><p>But, let’s face it, most people have no time for that or the patience.</p><p>So I will give you the crash course for the 3 topics mentioned above.</p><h3>Linear Algebra</h3><p>Just watch the whole series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab">Essence of Linear Algebra</a> from the Youtube channel 3Blue1Brown.</p><p>The guy makes visual explanations of once hard concepts incredibly easy!</p><p>It is very far in terms of content compared to Professor Strang’s, but it’s enough, to begin with, and you can go after other topics as you advance in ML and DL.</p><h3>Calculus</h3><p>Guess what?</p><p>3Blue1Brown also has a whole series on Calculus on Youtube for you to watch for free: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr">Essence of Calculus</a>.</p><p>Again, he is very good at giving you the intuition of why and how rather than just throw some random equations on your face.</p><h3>Statistics</h3><p>This is a whole field that, in my opinion, you can learn as needed, a good reference is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Statistics-Data-Scientists-Essential/dp/1491952962">Practical Statistics for Data Scientists: 50 Essential Concepts</a>.</p><p>An objective book with some good examples for every concept.</p><p>Fast to read too.</p><p>As the title implies, it is more suitable for Data Scientists, but understanding some basics of statistics is always good and this is what this is book is for.</p><p>You won’t become a statistician after reading it, but you will learn some good stuff.</p><h2>The Bypassed: Machine Learning</h2><p>Everybody wants to jump straight into Deep Learning and be the cool guy training a single model for a week on a 12GB GPU.</p><p>But to get Deep Learning right, you need to go through Machine Learning first!</p><h3>Start from the beginning</h3><p>The concepts, the train of thought, the "feeling" of how things work start here and there is no one else more capable of teaching those concepts than Professor Andrew Ng in his course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Machine Learning</a>.</p><p>You may think this course is old and outdated, well, technology-wise, maybe, but conceptually-wise, it is better than anything else out there.</p><p>Professor Ng makes it easy to understand the math applied in every technique he teaches and gives you a solid understanding of what happens underneath in a very short and concise course.</p><p>All the exercises are made in Octave, a free version of Matlab of sorts, and you finish the course implementing your own Neural Network!</p><p>The syntax in Octave is easy to grasp for any programmer, so don’t let that be a barrier for you.</p><p>Once you finish the course, you will have implemented all the major algorithms and will be able to solve several prediction problems.</p><h3>Random Forests</h3><p>I said all the major algorithms, right?</p><p>Actually, there is but one flaw in Andrew Ng’s course, he doesn’t cover Random Forests.</p><p>An awesome complement to his course is fast.ai’s <a href="http://course18.fast.ai/ml">Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders</a>.</p><p>Jeremy Howard goes super practical on the missing piece in Ng’s course covering a topic that is, for many classical problems, the best solution out there.</p><p>Fast.ai’s approach is what is called Top-Down, meaning they show you how to solve the problem and then explain why it worked, which is the total opposite of what we are used to in school.</p><p>Jeremy also uses real-world tools and libraries, so you learn by coding in industry-tested solutions.</p><h2>Deep Learning</h2><p>Finally!</p><p>The reason why we are all here, Deep Learning!</p><p>Again, the best resource for it is Professor Ng’s course, actually, a series of courses.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/">Deep Learning Specialization</a> is composed of 5 courses total going from the basics and evolving on specific topics such as language, images, and time-series data.</p><p>One nice thing is that he continues from the very end of his classical Machine Learning course, so it just feels like an extension of the first course.</p><p>The math, the concepts, the notion of how and why it works, he delivers it all very concisely like few I’ve seen.</p><p>The only drawback is that he uses <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a> 1.x (Google’s DL Framework) in this course, but that’s minimal detail in my opinion since the explanations and exercises are so well delivered.</p><p>You can pick up the most recent version of the framework relatively easy and to do so there is the final piece of this guide, a book.</p><h3>Too much stuff, give me something faster</h3><p>This book might be the only thing you need to start, it is Aurélien Géron’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com.br/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow-ebook/dp/B07XGF2G87">Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems</a>.</p><p>It covers a lot, from classical Machine Learning to the most recent Deep Learning topics. Good examples and exercises using industry-grade frameworks and libraries.</p><p>I dare say that, if you are really in a rush, you can skip everything I said before and just go for the book.</p><p>You will miss a good amount of information contained on the other resources mentioned, but the practical and actionable knowledge from Géron’s book is enough to work on many ideas for your next project.</p><p>If you feel limited after only reading the book, go back and study the rest of the material, it will fill in the gaps you might have and give you a more solid understanding.</p><h2>What about Framework X or Y?</h2><p>"Hey, I’ve heard about PyTorch and that other framework or library X everybody talks about".</p><p>As a Software Engineer, you know better than anyone how fast technology evolves.</p><p>Don’t go crazy for that, after you learn the basics in this guide, you can easily go, for instance, on <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> documentation or any other library or framework of sorts and learn how to use it in a week or two.</p><p>The techniques, the concepts, are all the same, it is only a matter of syntax and application or even tastes that you might have for any given tool.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>To wrap it up, I want to say that, even though it might seem a lot, I tried to remove all the noise and at the end of the process, you will feel confident that you understand what is happening behind the curtains, the jargons and even be able to read some papers published in the field to keep up with the latest advances.</p><p>TL;DR Here is the list of resources mentioned in sequence:</p><ul><li><a href="https://renanmf.com/the-python-guide-for-beginners/">The Python Guide for Beginners</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab">Essence of Linear Algebra</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr">Essence of Calculus</a></li><li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Machine Learning</a></li><li><a href="http://course18.fast.ai/ml">Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders</a></li><li><a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/">Deep Learning Specialization</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com.br/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow-ebook/dp/B07XGF2G87">Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems</a></li></ul></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-5697" role="main"><div><div><div><p>A <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20039-w" target="_blank">new study of almost 40,000 adults</a> has found that the brains of lonely people differ from those of people who are not lonely, in significant and detectable ways. <span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p><p>This loneliness “signature” consists of variations in the volume of different brain regions, and the way those brain regions communicate. And these variations may be related to the typical thinking patterns of lonely people, which include for example higher than average amounts of reminiscence and imaginary conversations.</p><p>The study compared the MRI scans of people who said they “often” feel lonely with the scans of people do not report feeling that way. The data comes from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" target="_blank">UK Biobank</a>, which is an open-source database containing genetic and health information from about half a million people in the UK.</p><p>The 38,701 participants consisted of 47.5% men and 52.5% women. Their ages ranged from 40 – 69, with an average age of 55. About 13% of them answered “yes” to the question “Do you often feel lonely?” Of those who answered yes, about 39% were men, and 61% women.</p><p>The new paper appeared today (December 15) in <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/ncomms" target="_blank">Nature Communications</a></em>.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><h2>Lonely people and the default network</h2><p>The researchers behind the study, from McGill University in Montreal, found that the key differences involved the brain’s “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network" target="_blank">default network</a>.” This network is responsible for a wide range of mental processes that take place when the brain is at rest. These processes are often referred to as the “inner voice”, or the “self.”</p><p>The default network plays a crucial role in memory, social cognition (i.e. thinking about other people), and mental time travel (“What will I do tomorrow?”). It involves the medial prefrontal cortex, and the posterior cingulate cortex, along with a number of other structures. It is also responsible for hallucinations and internal imagery.</p><p>The researchers discovered, unexpectedly, that volumes in several of these default network regions were larger in lonely people. They also found equally unexpected patterns of positive associations between some of these regions.</p><h2>Feeling lonely: the typical thought patterns of lonely people</h2><p>The association between the default network and loneliness may be because of the way lonely people think. Lonely people have been found, for example, to focus more on internal thoughts, perhaps to compensate for their lack of actual social experiences. Their thought patterns tend to include above-average levels of reminiscing and imagined social exchanges. And this increase in thoughts about the self might well influence the relationship between the regions of the default network.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-box-4"></span></p><p>“In the absence of desired social experiences,” the authors write, “lonely individuals may be biased towards internally directed cognitions,” as if “to fill the social void.”</p><p>In that sense, then, the physical effects of loneliness on the brain are not surprising. Paying “greater attention to one’s inner milieu, and a heightened focus on the self and self-reflective thoughts,” the authors write, “would naturally engage memory-based functions of the default network.”</p><p>Indeed, <a href="https://amzn.to/3nnJzNk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">past research on loneliness</a> has found that lonely people are more likely to engage in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037%2F0022-3514.85.3.409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">imaginary social interactions</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1467-9280.2008.02194.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nostalgic reminiscences</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037%2F0033-295X.114.4.864" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypothetical conversations</a>, and are also more likely to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1467-9280.2008.02056.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treat pets like people</a>.</p><h2>So lonely: why studying loneliness matters</h2><p>Researchers are increasingly recognizing loneliness as a major health problem. A recent study, for example, found that <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/loneliness-among-older-americans-doubled-during-pandemic-poll-shows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loneliness has more than doubled among older people</a> since the Covid-19 pandemic began.</p><p>Past research has also shown that older people who experience loneliness have a higher risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Lonely people get sick more often, and take longer to get over infections. Loneliness also increases blood pressure and levels of stress hormones. Socially isolated people are more likely to be depressed, suffer from memory loss, and use alcohol and drugs. Likewise, evidence suggests that loneliness contributes to ageing in a number of ways, and leads to reduced longevity. In fact, the health risks of loneliness are <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691614568352" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">equivalent to those related to obesity or smoking 15 cigarettes a day</a>.</p><p>Understanding how loneliness works in the brain could one day help prevent neurological disease, and lead to better treatments.</p><p>“We speculate that the associations between the default network and loneliness revealed here,” the researcher write, “reflect increased demands on episodic mental simulation of inner social events in the absence of desired social experience in the external world.”</p><hr><p><strong>Study:</strong> “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20039-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The default network of the human brain is associated with perceived social isolation</a>“<br><strong>Authors:</strong> Nathan Spreng et al.<br><strong>Published in:</strong> <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/ncomms" target="_blank">Nature Communications</a></em><br><strong>Publication date: </strong>December 15, 2020<br><strong>DOI:</strong> http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20039-w<br><strong>Photo:</strong> by&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/@anthonytran?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Anthony Tran</a>&nbsp;via&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p><p>For a weekly summary of the latest psychology news, subscribe to our <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/the-psych-news-weekly-newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Psych News Weekly newsletter</a>.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="main">

<p>My first computer (Apple IIe) used 5-inch floppy disks. If a program didn’t fit on a single floppy, you might need to spread it across multiples, but otherwise this solution was fine. Floppy disks could hold the application AND the user data, be easily backed up or shared, and storing them was easy enough. The computer was old when I got it, and the former owner included something like 500 programs on floppy disk, an endlessly discoverable mountain of software.</p>
<p>My next computer (90s era IBM clone) had multiple media drives, a 3.5-inch floppy drive and a CD drive. The floppies held more data than the old 5-inchers, and had all the same upsides. I could work on something at home, bring it to a computer at school and just keep going. The CD drive was a big game changer though. A CD can hold 700mb of data, and my hard drive at the time was 600mb. A really common pattern was to run software off a CD, but save your user data on floppies or hard drive. There was internet, initially in the AOL and later dial-up, but bandwidth was expensive and transfer speeds were slow. So slow.</p>
<p>My next computer, a G3 Graphite iMac, had an optical drive that could read and write CDs and read DVDs. I used to rent movies from the Blockbuster where I worked and watch them on the tiny CRT screen. This was in the Napster days, and burning CDs was a boon. I could make mixes for friends or girlfriends, or even share my own music. I burned a lot of CDs in those days. The 100gb hard drive was enough that I didn’t miss my floppy drive, plus we had the internet everywhere by then.</p>
<p>Then came the MacBook Pro, a beast of a machine with a SuperDrive (burns CDs and DVDs), USBs galore and even an SD card reader. I owned two incarnations of this machine, one of which is still in service to this day. Around this time, my college started using Iomega Zip Disks, although I never bought a drive for myself, I did own several of the disks.</p>
<p>Now I have two computers I switch between, but neither accepts any form of physical media beyond a USB stick without the inclusion of an external drive. The Mac (my reluctant work machine), can’t even use these without a dongle. These computers are designed to rely on the internet as a means of installing programs and sharing data, which obviously works fine since everybody in the world is doing it that way.</p>
<h3 id="so-what">So what?</h3>
<p>I miss removeable physical media. I miss having a drawer of disks or CDs. Yes, I can still burn CDs, and do, but the subtle advantages of physical media are hard to fully grasp without an ecosystem.</p>
<p>In high school, every kid had a CD book in their backpack. We would ride the bus on field trips and look through each other’s collections to listen to them on the way. I discovered a lot of great music this way. I guess you could look through someone’s iTunes library or Spotify history, but it wouldn’t be the same.</p>
<p>On the same note, a lot of my early musical tastes were formed by listening to my parents old records. I can play songs I like for my children, but without a physical media library they are unlikely to discover my music on their own, especially without album art. I remember seeing the cover of <code>Eat A Peach</code> and thinking that I really wanted to listen to it.</p>
<p>As a parent I have a lot of pictures of my kids, many of which are precious to me. We’ve printed some out, stored others on a SSD, and the rest are in the cloud. Yes, we could print more/all of them, but we all know this is no longer the norm, and I’m probably never going to meander through the folders on our storage drive the way I used to through old family albums.</p>
<p>I think there was a lot of value in being able to run software directly off a CD instead of kludging up your internal storage with installed apps or relying on the cloud. Most software today is designed with the assumption that you have lots of memory, lots of storage and lots of cloud access. Can I even run a MacOS app directly off a CD? Maybe I should try. Look at your own Applications folder and tell me you really need all that installed on your machine. How easy is all that to uninstall if you want to? How big of a SSD would you actually need if you only stored your user data on your machine? How much less worried would you be about security if your computer didn’t require internet access to function? If, in 10 years I want to fire up an old computer or phone, could I even get software onto it?</p>

<p>Bad air is bad for you. The air purifier market, though, is a mess. Every purifier uses incompatible proprietary filters, presumably to lock you into buying replacements. How do we know these actually work? Few seem to publish lab tests. And why does it cost $100-$300 for a big plastic box with a fan and a filter inside?</p>

<p>It’s common to build DIY air purifiers by basically strapping a filter to a fan. I like the idea of these, but again, it’s hard to be confident they really work. There’s a few experiments out there, but not enough to make me comfortable. So I decided to do some experimenting of my own. I made a purifier, generated smoke, and measured how well it removes tiny particles.</p>



<p>If you’re in a hurry, this post says that if you strap two HEPA filters to a box fan, it will clear the air of basically all the particles we can measure, and it will do it faster than a commercial filter that costs twice as much.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/smallroom_log.jpg" alt="in a large room the DIY filter does slightly better than the commercial filter"></p>



<h3 id="diy-purifier">DIY purifier</h3>

<p>My DIY purifier was <em>very</em> simple. (I don’t want to promote any particular brands here. Contact me if you want the exact products.)</p>

<ul>
  <li>A standard box fan. (Cost: $19)</li>
  <li>Two HEPA air filters, each approximately 32 cm x 22 cm and 5cm thick. (Cost: $35 for both)</li>
  <li>A bungie cord. (Cost: Free)</li>
</ul>

<p>Assembly takes about 30s. You put the filters on the intake side of the fan and strap them on with the bungie cord. Here’s a picture:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/filter_notape.jpg" alt="DIY purifier" max-width="60%" min-width="35%"></p>

<p>Timeless elegance and grace, it is not. I get the shakes just looking at that bit of crinkled filter.</p>

<h3 id="commercial-purifier">Commercial purifier</h3>

<p>As a comparison, I got a $100 air purifier from a well-known brand that’s intended for small rooms. It uses uses a single HEPA filter that’s about 25cm x 12cm and 4cm thick. Replacement filters currently cost around $25.</p>

<h3 id="smoke">Smoke</h3>

<p>It’s surprisingly hard to repeatedly generate a consistent amount of smoke. I tried burning various things (paper, cardboard) and found that the number of particles generated can vary by an order of magnitude, depending on the burn pattern. This is difficult to control and effectively random.</p>

<p>Ideally, I’d have liked to burn some food product like oil, since the kitchen is usually the biggest source of indoor air pollution. I couldn’t figure out a good way of doing this, either: You’d need to have the same amount of oil distributed in the same way and heated to the same temperature.</p>

<p>I finally settled on using incense. I cut sticks to the length of a standard credit card and then attached the ends horizontal to the ground. This seemed to be pretty consistent. In retrospect, I bet that burning toast in a toaster would work well. (I didn’t have one on hand.)</p>

<h3 id="measurements">Measurements</h3>

<p>I borrowed a cheap-ish ($100) air quality monitor from a friend. I think it’s made by some company in China and then re-sold by various white-label brands. I can’t figure out who the original manufacturer is. Based on data I’ve seen for the reliability of other air quality monitors, I wouldn’t trust the absolute numbers, but the I think the <em>relative</em> measurements should still be OK.</p>

<p>The typical measurement for particulate pollution is “PM 2.5” which is in units of μg/m³. This is intended to measure what you’d get if you did the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Take a cubic meter of air.</li>
  <li>Filter all the solid particles out of the air.</li>
  <li>Keep only the solid particles that are are 2.5 micrometers (μm) or smaller.</li>
  <li>Weigh all the particles you kept in micrograms (μg).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some ways to interpret these numbers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The EPA says yearly averages should be below 12 and daily averages below 35.</li>
  <li>The average outdoor level ranges from 6 in Finland to almost 100 in Nepal. Rich countries are typically under 15. The highest levels are typically found in Asia and Africa.</li>
  <li>Cooking can easily cause PM 2.5 measurements to spike into the hundreds. I’ve observed myself that this can happen with only a small amount of visible smoke.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="logging">Logging</h3>

<p>Since the air quality monitor doesn’t log data, I used an ultra-hacky alternative: I set the monitor next to a laptop running a stopwatch. I then aimed a tabet at both of those screens and took a timelapse video. Finally, I manually transcribed the data by going to each minute marker in the data. (This was even more tedious than it sounds.)</p>



<p>I ran a first experiment in a tiny room of around 8 ㎥. Due to worries that wind from the purifiers might change the speed the incense burned, I placed it on the opposite side of a wall, with a gap of around 20 cm near the ceiling.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/setup_tinyroom.jpg" alt="tiny room setup"></p>

<p>I repeated the experiment once with no filter, once with a commercial filter, and once with the DIY filter. Here are the results:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/smallroom_linear.jpg" alt="smallroom measurements in linear space"></p>

<p>Things are a bit random around the beginning, probably due to the drifting of the smoke before it’s equalized in the room. With no filter at all, this spikes all the way to 1000 μg/m³, the maximum the instrument can show.</p>

<p>If we make the y-axis logarithmic, it becomes quite clear that the DIY filter is cleaning the air at a better rate. (This is the picture from the top of this page.)</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/smallroom_log.jpg" alt="smallroom measurements in log space"></p>

<p>If we take the EPA’s threshold of 12 μg/m³, the DIY filter gets there in around 15 minutes, while the commercial filter take around 25 minutes.</p>



<p>Thankfully, I don’t spend most of my time in an 8 ㎥ room. Thus, I repeated the experiment in a large room of around 100 ㎥. Here there was no wall between incense and purifier. Instead I left around a meter of distance between the incense and purifier and the purifier and the monitor.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/setup_largeroom.jpg" alt="large room setup"></p>

<p>Here are the results:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/largeroom_linear.jpg" alt="large room measurements in linear space"></p>

<p>There’s even more randomness around the beginning, probably just due to how the smoke drifts around. Based on the room volume we’d expect a peak concentration with no filter of around 80 μg/m³ = 1000 μg/m³ * (8/100). Reassuringly, this is pretty close to what we see.</p>

<p>The DIY purifier looks a bit better. If we plot in log space, it’s more clear that it is indeed filtering at a better rate:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/largeroom_log.jpg" alt="large room measurements in log space"></p>



<p>It’s common advice for DIY purifiers like this to seal around the edges of the filter so that all air must pass through it.  I share the intuition that this would help, but it’s hard to be sure: If you block airflow, you slow down the fan. This could be counterproductive.</p>

<p>In this case at least, experiment is easier than theory. I took packing tape and carefully sealed around the intake side.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/filter_tape.jpg" alt="DIY purifier with tape" max-width="60%" min-width="35%"></p>

<p>And the results are…</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/taping.jpg" alt="taping around the filter has no effect"></p>

<p>…nothing!?</p>

<p>This was unexpected. I thought the tape would help, but I wouldn’t have been surprised if it hurt instead. Instead, there’s basically no difference at all. I don’t know enough about fluid dynamics to even speculate about what’s happening here, so I won’t try.</p>

<p>There could be some weird quirk in how I ran this experiment. This doesn’t necessarily mean that all the advice to tape around the filter is <em>wrong</em>. However, I’ve never seen any experriments that show taping helps either.</p>



<p><strong>Cost.</strong> The DIY purifier isn’t dramatically cheaper than the commercial one, but I expect the filters would need to be replaced much less often. The commercial purifier uses a single filter with an area of 300 cm², whereas the DIY purifier uses two filters with a total area of around 1400 cm², and also slightly thicker. It’s reasonable to assume the DIY filters could remove ~4 times as many particles before replacement.</p>

<p><strong>Durability.</strong> One concern is that box fans aren’t meant to be used with filters attached and could wear out. This is reasonable. However, box fans are much cheaper than commercial purifiers, and I’ve been using this particular fan with various filters attached for several years now without issue.</p>

<p><strong>Electricity.</strong> The cost of electricity is another factor. Typical box fans seem to use around 55W, whereas commercial purifiers typically use 30-45W. If electricity costs $0.13 / kWh, the box fan would cost around $62 to operate 24 hours a day for a year, while a 30-watt purifier would cost around $34. Obviously, these numbers decrease if you run the purifier less. Some (more expensive) commercial purifiers have air quality sensors built in and automatically turn on only when needed.</p>

<p><strong>MERV or HEPA?</strong> Most people who build box-fan purifiers use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_efficiency_reporting_value">MERV</a>-rated filters intended for furnaces. Commercial air purifiers use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEPA">HEPA</a>-rated filters. Roughly speaking, HEPA filters are “better” in that they are rated to remove a higher percentage of particles in one pass. It’s not clear that HEPA filter will actual perform better when attached to a fan, though: A filter that catches fewer particles in one pass might still be better if it allows for faster airflow.</p>

<p><strong>That one video.</strong> If you’re reading this article after it was linked from some forum, I’d bet you that someone in the comments links to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kH5APw_SLUU">this video</a> from the Michigan Sinus Center. I found this inspirational, but note a couple of things: First, while the description says they use HEPA filter, the video clearly indicates a MERV filter. Again, that’s not necessarily bad! They claim that around 90% of particles sized 0.3 microns are larger are eliminated in a single pass. That’s good, but not totally reassuring. The question is, does it remove 99% in two passes? If 90% of the particles in the ambient air were large and the filter only catches large particles, then additional passes would never get rid of the most dangerous small particles. This is why I trust HEPA filters a bit more: since they remove almost all particles in one pass, I’m confident they should remove almost all particles eventually. This is also why I strongly prefer experiments that actually measure particles removed from the air in a room, rather than just the air coming out of the purifier.</p>

<p><strong>Further questions.</strong> There’s a lot of things that further experiments could look at:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Does the fan speed make a huge difference?</li>
  <li>How does the purifier compare to larger commercial purifiers?</li>
  <li>How do MERV-rated furnace-type filters compare under the same conditions?</li>
  <li>How can it not matter if there’s tape around the filters!?</li>
  <li>Does fan speed matter? (I always ran the box fan at maximum speed.)</li>
  <li>Is it better to put the filters on the intake or outtake side of the …</li></ol></div></div></div></div>

          <p>Hello everybody! I am going to write a tutorial on how to work with CSVs using TerminusDB. That’s right, TerminusDB 4.0 now has the feature in which you can import and export CSVs, Let’s dive into this.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-create-a-database-with-csvs">How to create a database with CSVs</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Open up the TerminusDB console and create a database</li>
  <li>Fill in the Id, Name and description of your database</li>
  <li>You will find a button Create Database from CSVs <img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/1-createdb.png" alt="create database with csvs" title="create database with csvs"></li>
  <li>Click on this button to load which ever CSVs you wish to import to your database, In this blog I am going to use <a href="https://terminusdb.com/blog/2020/09/01/my-first-terminusdb-3-0-graph-bike-share-data/">The Bike Share Data</a></li>
  <li>I have added 2 CSVs into my database as shown below <img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/2-createdbwithcsvpreview.png" alt="different csvs loaded into db" title="different csvs loaded into db"></li>
  <li>And that’s it, go ahead and click on Create New database, which includes the 2 CSVs in it 😊😊😊😊😊</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="what-happens-when-you-import-csvs-into-your-database"><strong>What happens when you import CSVs into your Database?</strong></h3>

<p>On creating our database, Go to the Documents Page</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/2-dbdocumentpage.png" alt="document page view" title="document page view"></p>

<p>Each of our CSV files that were loaded on create becomes a separate Document Type. All the columns in the CSV file have been converted into properties and a schema is auto-generated.</p>

<p>Each CSV is of doctype CSV and has rows hanging off them, we can use these auto generated column properties to query the database.</p>

<p>You can also add more CSVs once you have created your database by clicking the Add CSVs</p>

<p>Go to the Schema Page to view the property types which have been generated off the columns</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/3-trasnformcsvtoproperties.png" alt="comaprison between excel and loaded csv" title="comaprison between excel and loaded csv"></p>

<h3 id="lets-query-the-database">Let’s Query the Database</h3>

<p>Get CSV Id’s, Query for type scm:CSV</p>

<div><div><pre><code>and (
    triple('v:CSV ID', 'type','scm:CSV'),
    triple('v:CSV ID', 'label', 'v:CSV Name')
)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/4-querycsvid.png" alt="query database to get csv Id" title="query database to get csv Id"></p>

<p>This query simply gives you the ID and name of available CSVs in the Database. Take a note of the CSV Id you’re interested in, also visit the Schema page to get the Property Id’s your interested in as well.</p>

<p>Open a new Query Pane and try the below query</p>

<div><div><pre><code>const id="doc:CSV_bike_tutorial-1.csv"

WOQL.and (
  .limit(1).triple('v:CSV ID', 'type', 'scm:CSV')
    .eq('v:CSV ID', id)
    .triple('v:CSV ID', 'scm:csv_row', 'v:CSV Row')
    .triple('v:CSV Row', 'type', 'v:Row Type'),
  .quad('v:Property', 'domain', 'v:Row Type', 'schema/main')
    .quad('v:Property', 'label', 'v:Property Name' ,'schema/main')
)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This query gets all the property Id and name from the schema graph.</p>

<p>Next, let’s query to display a few columns of our CSV, I plan to display Start Station Number, Start Station, End Station Number, End Station and Duration</p>

<div><div><pre><code>const id="doc:CSV_bike_tutorial-1.csv"

const startStationNumber = "scm:column_Start%20station%20number"
const StartStation = "scm:column_Start%20station"
const endStationNumber = "scm:column_End%20station%20number"
const endStation = "scm:column_End%20station"
const duration = "scm:column_Duration"

and (
	triple('v:CSV ID', 'type','scm:CSV').eq('v:CSV ID', id)
      .triple('v:CSV ID', 'scm:csv_row', 'v:CSV Row')
      .triple('v:CSV Row', startStationNumber, 'v:Start Station Number')
      .triple('v:CSV Row', StartStation, 'v:Start Station')
      .triple('v:CSV Row', endStationNumber, 'v:End Station Number')
      .triple('v:CSV Row', endStation, 'v:End Station')
      .triple('v:CSV Row', duration, 'v:Duration')
)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All the rows of CSV matching the column names will be displayed on running this query</p>

<p>So yeah that’s it, you can do all sorts of queries on your CSV</p>

<h3 id="how-to-update-csv">How to update CSV</h3>

<p>I am going to show an example in which I change the duration of Bike number W22558 to 500 in my CSV file and I am going to update this change. So we go to Document Page and click on Add CSVs and add the CSV of interest</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/6-updatcsv.png" alt="update csv" title="update csv"></p>

<p>Since bike_tutorial-1.csv already exists, console will automatically prompt you to update the CSV. Input a commit message of what we have changed and hit on Upload CSV.</p>

<p>The brilliant part about the update is that only diffs are considered and updated which makes update of big sized files more efficient. To understand this, Go to DB Home Page -&gt; Latest Updates</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/7-latestudates.png" alt="DB Home latest updates " title="DB Home latest updates "></p>

<p>Click on your recent update, The only change on update was the row for bike W22558 of duration 417 was removed and a new row for bike W22558 with duration 500 was added instead. This makes updates of CSVs much more quick 😊😊😊😊😊</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/8-updatechange.png" alt="comparison between commits" title="comparison between commits"></p>

<p>You can also time travel on the database to see the diffs on CSV files over time.</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/9-commitime.png" alt="time travel on data" title="time travel on data"></p>

<h3 id="export-your-csv">Export your CSV</h3>

<p>Now that we have imported our CSVs into our database we can do whatever we like or modify it however we want and Export this CSV back.</p>

<p>Go to Documents, and filter for all CSV types to get a download option as shown and download the CSV.</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/5-export.png" alt="export csv from document page " title="export csv from document page "></p>

<p>So here we go, this tutorial shows a very simple way to import  CSVs into TerminusDB and play with them and do all sorts of useful cool queries, whatever you like.</p>

<p>Earlier we had to do all the steps mentioned in <a href="https://terminusdb.com/blog/2020/07/13/terminusdb-importing-reordering-exporting-a-csv/">TerminusDB: Importing, Reordering &amp; Exporting a CSV</a> not anymore!</p>

<p>Now it’s just a few button clicks and voilà!</p>

<blockquote><p>“The only thing that matters is getting to product-market fit… Product-market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market.”</p><cite> MARC ANDREESSEN</cite></blockquote>
</div></div>



<p>Marc Andreessen wrote these words back in 2007, coining the term product-market fit. While the concept has gained widespread adoption there remains a lack of consensus on what it means at a more precise level. For an early stage company, it is still really hard to both recognize the signs of product-market fit, as well as to optimally execute towards amplifying these early signals.</p>



<p>At Tribe Capital we recognize the importance of objectively measuring product-market fit and have developed frameworks to do so using company data. It has not been easy: we have exercised and refined these frameworks hundreds of times across companies in a wide variety of industries across our collective operating and investing history spanning companies such as Facebook, Slack, Front, Carta, and countless other early stage companies. But the payoff has been worth it. These analytical tools are not only useful to inform and improve our investment decisions, but also provide invaluable perspective for founders and operators looking to achieve or amplify existing product-market fit.</p>



<p>This article will first go into greater detail of why we believe a quantitative approach to product-market fit is important. Then it will outline in detail three types of analyses we employ at Tribe Capital to understand product-market fit in a given company. Finally, there are some closing thoughts regarding opportunities for further analysis as well as an appendix that addresses some frequently asked questions.</p>



<h3>Accounting for Product-Market Fit</h3>



<p>A quantitative approach to product-market fit for startups is akin to the discipline of financial accounting. The income statement and balance sheet are the <em>lingua franca</em> for an established company to communicate the financial health of its business. These accounting concepts are often unhelpful when inspecting an unprofitable early-stage company. For a startup, what’s needed is a common quantitative language for what matters, namely, a quantitative framework for assessing product-market fit.</p>



<p>Just as larger companies employ accountants to monitor financial health (cash flows, profitability, etc), so to do product-oriented startups employ people to monitor the health of its product-market fit. They just go by a different name: data scientists. The term “data science” as currently used in the industry is quite broad and covers a wide spectrum of activities spanning what would be better thought of as ML engineering all the way to activities that are typically focused on decision-making and often referred to as “analytics”. For our purposes, we tend to use the latter end of the spectrum as there are numerically more data scientists in analytics style roles than in ML engineering style roles and because the analytics use case is more broadly applicable in early stage companies. In any case, from our point of view, accountants were the first data scientists.</p>



<p>The functional roles of accountants and data scientists are similar: take a big pile of raw data and use it to dig into important aspects of the business. Accountants work with a ledger of every financial transaction to answer whether the business is cash-flow positive, how costs are broken down between fixed and variable, what are the assets and liabilities, etc. Data scientists work with large datasets of customer activity to determine how the product is growing, how retention/churn is playing out, etc. This is why we have chosen to make data science a central component to what we are building at Tribe Capital.</p>



<p><strong>Accounting: Financial Health ↔ “Data Science” : Product-Market Fit</strong></p>



<p>In our development of frameworks for product-market fit, we have taken cues from the principles of accounting and tried to adhere to the following tenets:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Simple</strong>: Definitions should be easy to understand.</li><li><strong>Detailed</strong>: Yet well-defined enough to be useful.</li><li><strong>Universal</strong>: Applicable to a broad range of products and businesses.</li></ul>



<p>In accounting, the three most important frameworks for understanding a business are the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. These three statements do not provide a complete picture of a company’s health, but they provide a useful snapshot that can be used to benchmark it against other businesses across sectors.</p>



<p>Along those lines, we view product-market fit through three standardized analyses:</p>



<ul><li>Growth Accounting</li><li>Customer Cohorts</li><li>Distribution of Product-Market Fit</li></ul>



<p>As with financial statements, we do not claim these analyses to be an exhaustive definition of product-market fit. Rather, they provide a consistent and extensible method for breaking down customer behavior while being detailed enough to be useful. Also note that most people think of product-market fit in binary terms – either you have it or you don’t. In contrast, we tend to think of it as a spectrum similar to the concept of “financially healthy” for a more mature business.</p>



<p>As investors, we use these analytical techniques to understand whether a company has achieved product-market fit. While these analyses are a critical component of our investment process, they are not the sole deciding factor but are rather a starting point for discussion. We use them the same way Warren Buffet uses financial statements to guide his investments. Does he look at them? Absolutely. Would he ever pass based on financial statements? Absolutely. Would he ever invest based only on financial statements? Hopefully not.</p>



<p>For founders and operators, these frameworks are useful to understand and amplify a company’s growth. We have found that nearly every successful technology company founded in the last two decades has employed them in one form or another. The frameworks provide precise concepts and quantitative relationships that are useful for understanding how customers engage with the company’s product while being universal enough to be applicable in almost any context in which the concept of product-market fit is useful.</p>



<h3>Growth Accounting</h3>



<p>The first technique we use at Tribe Capital when looking at a company is “growth accounting,” which breaks down overall growth in some activity across specific customer segments. The activity can be anything, though revenue and product engagement are the most common examples of growth accounting. To begin, we will focus on revenue and then abstract into engagement later on.</p>



<p>There are six categories that revenue can be bucketed into:</p>



<ul><li><strong>New</strong>: Gained from customers were first active in the present time period.</li><li><strong>Churned</strong>: Lost when a customer who was active in the previous time period has no revenue in the present one.</li><li><strong>Resurrected</strong>: Gained from customers who had churned at some point in the past (and thus generated no revenue in the previous time period) but resumed in the present.</li><li><strong>Expansion</strong>: Gained from customers increasing revenue relative to the previous time period.</li><li><strong>Contraction</strong>: Lost from customers decreasing (but not to zero, otherwise they would be churned) revenue relative to the previous time period.</li><li><strong>Retained: </strong>Carried over by customers from the previous time period to the present one.</li></ul>



<p>For example, a customer who spent $10 last month and $12 this month would have $2 in expansion revenue and $10 in retained revenue. However, if this customer instead spent $8 this month (while still spending $10 last month), then $8 would be counted as retained and $2 as contracted.</p>



<p>There are three important identities that express the definitions above:</p>



<ol start="1"><li>All revenue in the present time period is equal to the sum of the gains in revenue (new, resurrected, and expansion) and retained revenue.</li></ol>



<p>Revenue(t) = retained(t) + new(t) + resurrected(t) + expansion(t)</p>



<ol start="2"><li>All revenue from the previous time period must either churn, contract, or be retained in the present time period.</li></ol>



<p>Revenue(t-1) = retained(t) + churned(t) + contraction(t)</p>



<ol start="3"><li>All <em>change</em> in revenue across a time period is equal to the sum of the gains (new, expansion, and resurrected) minus the sum of the losses (churned and contraction). </li></ol>



<p>Revenue(t) – Revenue(t-1) = new(t) + expansion(t) + resurrected (t) – churned(t) – contraction(t)</p>



<p>For the last identity, we can convert the terms into percentages (e.g. “% New” is new revenue divided by total revenue from the previous time period) to frame everything in terms of the overall growth rate.</p>



<p>Growth_rate ~ New_rate + Resurrected_rate + Expansion_rate – Contraction_rate – Churn_rate</p>



<p>There are three useful statistics that come out of growth accounting:</p>



<p><strong>1. Gross retention</strong> is equal to retained revenue divided by total revenue from the previous time period.</p>



<p>Gross retention = retained(t) / revenue(t-1)</p>



<p><strong>2. Quick ratio</strong> is the sum of gains in revenue (new, resurrected, and expansion) divided by the losses in revenue (churned and contraction).</p>



<p>Quick ratio = [new(t) + resurrected(t) + expansion(t)] / [churned(t) + contraction(t)]</p>



<p>Quick ratio measures how efficiently a company is growing in terms of revenue gained per every unit of revenue lost. (By its definition, a quick ratio below 1.0x means that total revenue must be shrinking.)</p>



<p><strong>3. Net churn </strong>is the sum of losses minus gains in revenue from existing customers only (i.e. excluding new customers) divided by total revenue from the previous time period.</p>



<p>Net_Churn = [churned(t) + contraction(t) – resurrected(t) – expansion(t)] / revenue(t-1)</p>



<p>Note that, by definition…</p>



<p>Growth_rate ~ New_rate – Net_churn</p>



<p>For example, a company with 2% net churn loses 2% of its revenue assuming that it generates no new customers. Note that net churn can be negative, which means that the company will grow revenue even <em>without </em>gaining new customers. Usually, negative net churn is achieved by the company getting significant expansion revenue from its customer base and is a positive signal in any business.</p>

                    <p><em>Written by Jonah Kanner and Jameson Rollins of LIGO Laboratory, California Institute of Technology and Leo Singer of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.</em></p><p>Gravitational-wave detectors - like <a href="https://ligo.org/">LIGO</a> and <a href="https://www.virgo-gw.eu/">Virgo</a> - are some of the newest tools being used to explore objects in distant galaxies. The current generation of detectors began observing in 2015, and since then, have published observations of 50 collisions of black holes and neutron stars. These exciting discoveries are changing the way astrophysicists are learning about a broad range of topics - including how stars evolve, the expansion rate of the universe, and the deep laws that describe gravity and other fundamental forces.</p><p>LIGO and Virgo data are freely available through the <a href="https://www.gw-openscience.org/about/">Gravitational Wave Open Science Center (GWOSC)</a>. These public data sets are being used all over the world, by scientists, teachers, students, and artists, and have contributed to the publication of over 100 scientific articles over the past year.</p><h2 id="barriers-to-learning">Barriers to learning</h2><p>There’s one challenge encountered by everyone getting started with gravitational-wave data for the first time: &nbsp;most options for working with these data sets demand installing specialized software libraries and writing computer code to process and display the results. For professional scientists, this is often OK - a full-time researcher can afford to spend a few hours installing and learning new software, and likely has already had some experience programming. But for a much broader audience - including high school students, teachers, and artists - writing code in Python to just get started with gravitational-wave data is a significant barrier.</p><p>We’d experimented with a few different options to make this transition easier. In fact, cloud hosted <a href="https://www.gw-openscience.org/tutorials/">Jupyter notebooks</a> provided a big step forward, and we were able to show students how to write code to work with our data, without asking them to install any libraries on their own machines. But when we shared these notebooks with teachers and artists, they were not interested: <strong>they wanted some way to work with gravitational-wave data without using any code at all!</strong></p><p>Moreover, it's not just new students who can benefit from an easier method to access LIGO/Virgo data. Even though professional scientists often <em>could </em>write specialized code to make the plot they want, it’s not efficient to have lots of scientists re-writing code to make the most popular plots.</p><h2 id="enter-streamlit">Enter Streamlit</h2><p>Knowing that we had a need for a web app for the most common plots - both to broaden access and to improve research efficiency - we were excited to discover <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a>. Python is very popular in our research community, so Streamlit apps can easily make use of some of the most cutting-edge modules used for gravitational-wave research. For example, <a href="https://pycbc.org/">pycbc</a> and <a href="https://gwpy.github.io/">gwpy</a> are packages used by many gravitational-wave researchers to process and display LIGO/Virgo data. With Streamlit, we can easily write apps that let students and scientists use these packages, without writing any code themselves. Because GWOSC provides data access through a simple API, we found that Streamlit apps can access data on demand, and so process and display any segment of public data.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ytV1KhjEQbs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption><a href="https://www.gw-openscience.org/path/">Getting started video from GWOSC Learning Paths - video created by Cardiff University Physics &amp; Astronomy</a></figcaption></figure><p>Today, we’re using two Streamlit apps to introduce students to LIGO/Virgo data as part of the <a href="https://www.gw-openscience.org/path/">GWOSC Learning Paths</a>, and a third app, the <a href="https://range.ligo.org/">Gravitational Wave Inspiral Range Calculator</a>, allows scientists and astronomers to easily calculate how far into the universe current and future detectors can see.</p><h2 id="working-with-data">Working with data</h2><p>To help students and scientists get started working with gravitational-wave data, we wrote the <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/jkanner/streamlit-dataview/master/app.py/+/">GW Quickview App</a> to make some common plots with any stretch of data. Users can instantly make plots by selecting a published gravitational-wave event from a list, or by entering any time LIGO and Virgo were running. The Quickview App has access to the full public archive of LIGO/Virgo data - around 30 TB and growing! Sliders allow the user to set filter and plotting options, and even to directly download the filtered data. In most cases, you can see the signal from a black hole merger or neutron star collision with just a few clicks. This app is a great way to take a first peak at a segment of data and explore the archive.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.10.23-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.10.23-PM.png 600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.10.23-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.10.23-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.10.23-PM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://share.streamlit.io/jkanner/streamlit-dataview/master/app.py/+/">GW Quickview App</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="how-far-can-ligo-see">How far can LIGO see?</h2><p>One of the most important things to know about a gravitational-wave detector is how sensitive it is to the kinds of signals it’s capable of detecting. Ground-based gravitational-wave detectors primarily target the mergers of black holes or neutron stars, also known as compact binary coalescences (CBCs). Since the amplitude of a CBC signal is inversely proportional to how far away it is, the question is usually asked in terms of how far away can we detect the signal from a given type of CBC. In LIGO’s first observing run (O1) the LIGO detectors could detect binary neutron star (BNS) mergers out to a distance of roughly 70 megaparcecs (Mpc), or 230 million light-years. As the detectors have improved, the so-called “inspiral range” has increased as well; during the O3 run the LIGO BNS inspiral range was nearly 120 Mpc. Every time the range doubles the volume of space searched goes up by a factor of 8, and the event rate is proportional to volume. That’s a lot more events!</p><p>While plenty of tools exist to calculate the range for a given detector, all of them required special access and knowledge to run. With Streamlit, we were able to create a simple web app tool for anyone to <a href="https://range.ligo.org/">calculate the inspiral range for any type of CBC</a> they wish, for any point of the past observing runs, or even for hypothetical detectors that are yet to be built. This app should be useful for LIGO scientists, for the general astronomy community, and for the public at large.<br></p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.10.00-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.10.00-PM.png 600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.10.00-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.10.00-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.10.00-PM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://range.ligo.org/">Gravitational Wave Inspiral Range Calculator</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="finding-signals-in-the-noise">Finding signals in the noise</h2><p>Gravitational wave signals are typically buried in noise; finding them requires a few signal processing tricks. These signal processing concepts are new to many students, and can be a barrier to understanding data from LIGO and Virgo. Working with Professor Amber Stuver at Villanova, we created an app to let students try out some signal processing in an easy to use, interactive environment. The <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/jkanner/streamlit-audio/main/app.py">Signal Processing Tutorial</a> asks visitors to apply high-pass filtering and whitening to noisy data, to find a secret sound hidden in the noise. Then, they can try their new skills on some real data, and try to recreate a well known plot showing the first gravitational-wave observation of a binary black hole merger. Following hints from a <a href="https://blog.streamlit.io/uc-davis-tool-tracks-californias-covid-19-cases-by-region/">post by Pranav Pandit</a>, we found we were able to speed up the app by porting plots from <code>matplotlib</code> to <code>altair</code>, so that students can adjust plot parameters and see updates almost instantly.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.12.26-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.12.26-PM.png 600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.12.26-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.12.26-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.12.26-PM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://share.streamlit.io/jkanner/streamlit-audio/main/app.py">Signal Processing Tutorial</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="building-the-app">Building the app</h2><p>We built the GW Quickview App partly as an experiment, to see how easy it would be to run some of our favorite python modules in Streamlit. In this case, we tried using gwpy, which has a number of handy methods for finding, processing, and plotting LIGO and Virgo data.</p><h3 id="data-discovery-and-download">Data discovery and download</h3><p>The <a href="https://github.com/jkanner/streamlit-dataview">app code</a> uses the gwosc client for data discovery, to get a list of all published gravitational-wave events, and find their GPS times:</p><pre><code>
from gwosc import datasets
eventlist = datasets.find_datasets(type='events')
chosen_event = st.sidebar.selectbox('Select Event', eventlist)
t0 = datasets.event_gps(chosen_event)

</code></pre><p>Then, it uses gwpy to download the data file with the corresponding time:</p><pre><code>
from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries
strain = TimeSeries.fetch_open_data(detector, t0-14, t0+14, cache=False)


</code></pre><p>The strain data are stored in some pretty big files (up to 500 MB), so we used the cache feature of <code>streamlit</code> to allow users to change plot parameters without needing to repeat the data download.</p><h3 id="data-processing">Data processing</h3><p>To make plots where you can see a signal in GW data, some signal processing steps are needed to reduce the impact of noise. The app uses the <a href="https://gwpy.github.io/docs/stable/api/gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries.html"><code>bandpass()</code> and <code>whiten()</code></a> <a href="https://gwpy.github.io/docs/stable/api/gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries.html">methods</a> of gwpy to do this. Sliders allow the user to set the limits on the band-pass filter, and to toggle whitening on or off. The app also uses the gwpy <a href="https://gwpy.github.io/docs/stable/examples/timeseries/qscan.html"><code>q_transform</code></a> method to make a beautiful time-frequency plot, which allows most detectable events to be clearly seen in the figure. Additional sliders allow setting plot parameters, so the user can fine-tune the time-frequency plot to look just right. We even used the new <code>streamlit beta_expander<strong>()</strong></code><strong> </strong>to allow the user to display hints about how to understand the plots and set the parameters.</p><h3 id="display-the-plots">Display the plots</h3><p>Finally, the app displays several plots to visualize the data. We opted to use convenient methods in gwpy to make plots with <code>matplotlib</code>, which saved us from writing code to style and label the plots. That fact that Streamlit can easily display these plots with <code>streamlit.pyplot()</code> was a big plus for us, and the Streamlit team helped us fix some <a href="https://blog.streamlit.io/uc-davis-tool-tracks-californias-covid-19-cases-by-region/">issues related to thread-safety</a> when using this feature.</p><p>Though we know that Streamlit apps run faster when plotting with <code>altair</code> (we used this trick in another app!), for the GW Quickview App, we chose to keep the <code>matplotlib</code> plots, mainly to demonstrate the handy plotting features built into gwpy.</p><h2 id="the-big-picture">The big picture </h2><p>A number of break-throughs in the past few years have proved that gravitational-wave detectors represent a new and exciting way to learn about our universe. To make use of this new technology, we’ll need to train the next generation of scientists who will build the instruments of the future and study their observations. After getting started with Streamlit apps and <a href="https://www.gw-openscience.org/path/">GWOSC Learning Paths</a>, we hope some students will move on to use …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>I heard a lot about impostor syndrome. But there’s something bigger than that. The size of the developers ego. It’s unbelievable. Let’s talk about it.</p>



<h3>Sunday Rockstar</h3>



<p>By the end of summer 2013, my head was so big I couldn’t get through doors. At that point, I only have two years of experience behind me. So I’m just coming out of the “junior period”. <strong>And above all, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.24joursdeweb.fr/2019/reconnaitre-et-mettre-fin-a-ton-burnout/" target="_blank">in the previous episode of this story</a>(french version), I was doing a complete burn-out because of a project that came straight from hell.</strong> It was basically a trap. Not enough time and a monstrous scope.</p>



<p>After almost two months of work, like a maniac, I shipped a huge app for a big client. I’ve done it ! I did this alone. I did this on time. And i really felt that I had gained expertise.</p>



<p>After a period of post-burnout depression, I came back angry. So angry. <strong>This prowess</strong> <strong>made my head swell up like crazy.</strong> I really thought I was an important person. I would arrive in the morning and walk across the open space without saying hello to anyone.</p>



<div><figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/NThhQp6mHoFkVuRw9y/giphy.gif" alt="ego"></figure></div>



<p>I would sit at my desk and start my day by complaining about totally stupid customer requests. Then, I would go into meetings and make monologues about how stuff should be made. <strong>I didn’t give a fuck what anybody else was saying.</strong> I was in a special situation. One of the most experienced dev in this little organization. And, in my head, everything I touched turned to gold.</p>



<p>I used to do the same thing all the time. Same technology, same projects, same issues, same context, same load, again and again. In a situation like that, without any challenge, it’s easy to produce fast and well. <strong>It galvanized me in my feeling of being the best. </strong>I told myself that everything was so simple. And if anyone wasn’t keeping pace, I would immediately point the finger at them in the most toxic way possible.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/k7SWxdv.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/k7SWxdv.jpg" alt="finger"></figure>



<p>This situation lasted for months. It was bad. And since I was relying only on my past exploits, it was impossible for me to evolve. <strong>And then one day, a major event suddenly changed my approach to everything.</strong></p>



<h3>Why so arrogant?</h3>



<p>Before that, I would like to discuss why this ego overflow is relatively common in tech.</p>



<p>First of all, because companies are at the mercy of technology. In this context, you are the one who gives answers and really knows how the product works. Worse than that, they see what you do like black magic. Like an illusionist, most people don’t understand what you’re doing. But everybody thinks it’s extraordinary. <strong>When people tell you that you’re a magician all the time, you end up believing it.</strong> And each time you do, a dose of ego is injected into your skull.</p>



<p>Juniors are more affected by the phenomenon than seniors. Many companies do the same thing, the same way, all the time. And when it’s so easy, you don’t realize it anymore. <strong>When you don’t know what you don’t know, you think you know everything.</strong> And when a junior is not tutored and/or accompanied by more senior developers, it’s dangerous. You end up with an arrogant kid who thinks he’s a killer.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/i1DfNLW.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/i1DfNLW.jpg" alt="ego"></figure>



<p>Also, our field is extremely competitive. Voluntarily or not, companies put developers in competition with each other. Who will be the first to solve the bug? Who has the best architecture? Who knows the most? And I’m not even talking about the competitions that are legion. <strong>And you, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=AlgoRank" target="_blank">how high are you ranked</a> ?</strong> In such an extreme competitive environment, egos can be spectacular.</p>



<p>It’s not reserved to juniors. A lot of developers with more experience are affected, too. What you do is super complicated. <strong>Solving complex problems, faster and faster, of course it flatters ego.</strong> And if you’re not careful, you can quickly fall into disdain for others who don’t keep up. Especially with the juniors. Most developers take a pedagogical and tutoring approach. Others become jerks.</p>



<p>What makes the two profiles quite different is the acceptance of a simple fact. <strong>You don’t know everything, anyone can teach you something, and that’s very positive.</strong> And sometimes it only takes one event to realize that.</p>



<h3>Back to reality</h3>



<p>After several months of nonsense, I was at the top of my bullshit.<strong> King of idiots in a world without any challenges.</strong> And since there was no one to calm me down, it could have gone on for a long time.</p>



<p>And one Friday night, I joined my entire company for drinks at a nearby bar. This company was working in a big co-working space with a lot of other companies. And all these companies were smaller, but their projects were technically very challenging.</p>



<p>I show up and yell at anyone that I’m an expert in just about everything. Oh, yeah, I do architecture and everything else. It was fucking ridiculous. Anyway, at that moment a senior developer from another company hears me talking shit in the distance and comes up to me. He needs to talk to an expert for one of his issues. And in my great kindness, I agree to give him some time.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/c8Toum8.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/c8Toum8.jpg" alt="meet"></figure>



<p>And I’m not lying to you, <strong>I didn’t understand all the words in his problem statement</strong>. I was shocked, but I tried to follow what he was telling me as best I could. He exposed to me his problem and asked me what type of data structure, and therefore what algorithm, would be the most optimized for his problem in his existing architecture. </p>



<p>It was an extremely advanced problem. <strong>It dealt with concepts that I had vaguely discussed in school, but never practiced.</strong> He felt that i was confused, so he took it down a notch and asked me what I thought about this or that language for his problem. I had no idea because I was working with only one language and was not interested in anything else. And that’s when he started teaching me about life on my own language that he knocked me out.</p>



<div><figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-073103809f1b257a483269bc99d48db5" alt="ego"></figure></div>



<p>The worst part of this story is that in reality, this dude was very nice with me. <strong>I’m the one who mistook this for violence.</strong> It was violence for my ego. I wasn’t ready, but it was exactly what I needed at the time. Pain is a great teacher. And it hurted like hell.</p>



<h3>It’s all relative</h3>



<p>Being efficient and productive for your team is your main goal. Once you get there, there’s something you need to keep in mind. <strong>You are efficient and productive in this context.</strong> Once you’re out of that context, you’re going to have to rethink and question yourself.</p>



<p><strong>The myth of the developer who knows absolutely everything is totally false.</strong> There will always be someone to teach you something, because there’s too much to learn. The problem is that if you convince yourself you’re a god, you’ll end up believing it. The higher your ego will take you, the harder the fall.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/I2RIDze.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/I2RIDze.jpg" alt="fall"></figure>



<p>And there are other hellish effects of having so many high ego profiles in our field. First of all, <strong>it’s intimidating for a lot of people</strong>, but more importantly, <strong>it can very quickly jeopardize entire projects</strong>.</p>



<h3>Ego programming</h3>



<p>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, I saw with my own eyes computer projects blown up in mid-air because of overflowing egos.</p>



<p>I saw a team of big senior developers get together for an ambitious project. The idea was to go fast. When the time came to make technical decisions, no one agreed. <strong>Nobody wanted to be wrong and sit on their ego.</strong> And when the first insults appear in pull requests, the project got reboot.</p>



<p>I saw a lead tech forcing his homemade framework. Every developer without exception politely asked for a free and more maintainable solution. <strong>This lead tech decreed that the only choice was his homemade framework.</strong> This dude ego cost the company several developers in a matter of weeks.</p>



<p>I’ve seen so many times entire days of work wasted because a developer was too proud to ask for help. I’ve seen so many times developers redo code they thought was bad without asking the author why. I could go on like that for a long time. </p>



<h3>Egoless programming</h3>



<p>The weekend after this big discussion with this developer, I felt bad. I finally got my head out of my ass and realized I had so much to learn that it was scary. </p>



<p>The more I evolve and learn in this job, the more I realize how much I don’t know. Since that day, I have approached this job with humility. <strong>This trigger tremendously helped me in my career.</strong> And I strongly advise you to do the same. Stay proud of what you’ve accomplished and what you know, but be aware of what you don’t know.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NvadHD5.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/NvadHD5.jpg" alt="rise"></figure>



<p>It’s the same pattern all over the place. <strong>Huge egos, immaturity and a lack of perspective in a highly competitive environment.</strong> When I see initiatives like <a href="https://compassionatecoding.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compassionate coding</a> or the well known <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 commandments of egoless programming</a>, I tell myself that I’m not the only one to have noticed all this.</p>



<h3>Ego is important</h3>



<p>Now, be careful, ego is still important. <strong>You need confidence in yourself and your abilities.</strong> Approaching this job with humility doesn’t mean letting yourself be stepped on. It means taking the time to listen to everyone before giving your point of view. It means taking everyone’s ideas into account in an unbiased way. <strong>It means making your solution heard when you’re right.</strong> It means accepting when you’re wrong.</p>



<p>Understanding that no one is irreplaceable. <strong>Not you, not me, not your boss, not your CTO</strong>. Understand that calling your colleagues bad is not going to help the project go forward. Understand that just because you consider yourself a god doesn’t mean it’s true. Understand that if you make a mistake it’s not the end of the world. Besides, it’s okay if someone points it out to you. Understanding that it’s your mistakes that will make you grow faster.</p>



<h3>Epilogue</h3>



<p>If this article can even trigger a single click in someone, I would be very happy. There’s still a lot to be said on the subject, but I prefer to stick to the essentials. Your huge misplaced ego won’t get you anywhere. It’s time to keep it out of your career.</p>

</ul>

<p>I’m pleased to finally have some results to show for a project I’ve been working on in my spare time for the last year or so.</p>

<p>The idea originated when I was trying to think of an interesting idea for a project to help me learn Verilog and FPGA design, and the notion of building a simple raytracer came to mind (partly inspired by a scarily smart friend of mine who is building his own GPU). A bit later - because sometimes my brain hates me and delights in coming up with silly things to do - this turned into “wouldn’t it be interesting to try making a SNES do raytracing?”, and thus the SuperRT chip idea was born.</p>

<p>What I wanted to try and do was something akin to the Super FX chip used in titles such as Star Fox, where the SNES runs the game logic and hands off a scene description to a chip in the cartridge to generate the visuals. To that end I’ve deliberately tried to restrict myself to just using a single custom chip for the design, not making use of the ARM core available on the DE10 board or any other external processing resources.</p>

<p>The end results look something like this:</p>

<p>Apologies for the poor screenshot quality, incidentally - for some reason my capture card produces terrible results when capturing from my SNES, so I had to resort to the good old “photograph the screen in a darkened room” approach.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Hardware.jpg" alt="SuperRT development hardware"></p>

<p>The Super Nintendo (technically a Super Famicom) seen here has had the case removed to make room for the cabling, but other than that is totally unmodified. Attached to it is the PCB from a copy of an <em>awful</em> Pachinko game I picked up for 100 yen at a local second-hand store, with the game ROM removed and replaced with a cable breakout. This then passes through a set of level shifters to convert the SNES’s 5v down to 3.3v and then into a DE10-Nano FPGA development board with a Cyclone V FPGA. The level shifter boards are anything but pretty - and assembling them was a nightmare thanks to the necessary ICs only being available in surface-mount packages - but they do the job.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Slide3.jpg" alt="Hardware layout diagram"></p>

<p>The SuperRT chip constructs the scene using a specialised command language which is executed by one of three parallel execution units on the chip - essentially specialised CISC processors - to perform ray intersection tests. The scene description allows objects to be constructed using a subset of CSG operations, using spheres and planes as the basic building blocks and then performing OR, AND and subtraction operations using them to build up the desired geometry. AABBs are also supported, although primarily for use in culling tests (they can be rendered if desired, but they have a lower positional accuracy than other primitives and thus this is not generally very useful except for debugging purposes).</p>

<p>
 <video width="320" height="240" autoplay="" loop="">
  <source src="https://www.shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Artefact.mp4" type="video/mp4">

 </video> 
</p>

<p>The renderer casts up to four rays per screen pixel, calculating direct shadows from a directional light source and a single reflection bounce. Surfaces each have a diffuse colour and reflectivity property, and it’s possible to apply modifiers to these based on CSG results or specialised functions - this is used to generate the checkerboard pattern on the floor.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Slide2.jpg" alt="SuperRT screenshot"></p>

<p>The ray colour for each pixel is calculated by a “ray engine”, which handles the overall ray lifecycle and uses an “execution engine” module to run the command program describing the scene as many times as is required to resolve the ray. The command program itself is uploaded from the SNES and stored in a local 4K RAM buffer - animation is performed by writing modified commands into this buffer as required. A disassembled command buffer looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>0000 Start
0001 Plane 0, -1, 0, Dist=-2
0002 SphereSub OH 2, 1, 5, Rad=5
0003 SphereSub OH 4, 1, 4, Rad=4
0004 SphereSub OH 5, 1, 9, Rad=9
0005 SphereSub OH 2, 1, 2, Rad=2
0006 SphereSub OH -0.5, 1, 2, Rad=2
0007 RegisterHitNoReset 0, 248, 0, Reflectiveness=0
0008 Checkerboard ORH 48, 152, 48, Reflectiveness=0
0009 ResetHitState
0010 Plane 0, -1, 0, Dist=-2.150146
0011 RegisterHit 0, 0, 248, Reflectiveness=153
0012 AABB 4, -2.5, 11,    8, 3.5, 13
0013 ResetHitStateAndJump NH 44
0014 Origin 6, 2, 12
0015 Plane -0.2929688, 0, -0.9570313, Dist=0.2497559
0016 PlaneAnd OH 0.2919922, 0, 0.9560547, Dist=0.25
0017 PlaneAnd OH 0, 1, 0, Dist=1
0018 PlaneAnd OH 0, -1, 0, Dist=4
0019 PlaneAnd OH -0.9570313, 0, 0.2919922, Dist=-1
0020 PlaneAnd OH 0.9560547, 0, -0.2929688, Dist=1.499756
0021 RegisterHit 248, 0, 0, Reflectiveness=0
</code></pre>

<p>Each execution engine is a processor module with a 14 cycle pipeline, and in general one instruction is retired per cycle, so each execution unit can calculate about 50 million sphere, plane or AABB intersections per second. The exception to this is that branch operations have to flush the entire pipeline and thus have a  16 cycle overhead (14 cycles to flush the pipeline + 2 cycles instruction fetch delay). To try and avoid this as much as possible a branch prediction system is used - fortunately a lot of the time the spatial coherency of nearby rays means that a high prediction hit rate is achievable.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Slide5.jpg" alt="SuperRT screenshot"></p>

<p>Intersections in the execution engine are carried out by two pipelines, one handling AABBs and the other spheres and planes. The system as a whole works exclusively using 32-bit integer maths in 18.14 fixed point format, with 16-bit (2.14) format used where values are known to be in the +-1 range, and the sphere/plane intersection pipeline has two dedicated additional maths units that calculate reciprocal and square root operations.</p>

</p>

<p>Once a frame is rendered, the PPU converter module turns the framebuffer into a format that can be DMAed directly to the SNES VRAM for display, reducing it to 256 colours and swizzling it into character tile bitplanes. The screen resolution is 200x160 - this results in exactly 32000 bytes of image data for a full frame, which is transferred to VRAM in two 16000 bytes chunks over successive frames due to bandwidth constraints. Thus the full image can only be refreshed once every two frames, effectively limiting the maximum framerate to 30FPS - although the test scene runs at closer to 20FPS (primarily due to some bottlenecks with the logic on the SNES side at present).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many thanks to the participants in <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=20068">this thread</a> over at SNESdev for a lot of useful ideas on fullscreen expansion chip DMA that inspired the solution used here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://www.shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Slide4.jpg" alt="SuperRT screenshot"></p>

<p>The chip also implements a number of other basic functions - there is an interface to the SNES cartridge bus, along with a small program ROM holding 32K of code for the SNES (this is constrained by the fact that the interface board currently only connects up the SNES Address Bus A lines, and thus the effective usable address space is a mere 64K, of which 32K is used for memory-mapped IO registers to communicate with the SuperRT chip). There is also a multiplication accelerator unit that lets the SNES perform 16x16bit multiply operations rapidly.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Shot13.jpg" alt="SuperRT screenshot"></p>

<p>For debugging, I used the HDMI interface on the DE10 board to output data to a second monitor, along with a Megadrive joypad connected to the GPIO pins to manipulate the debug system. Resource constraints mean that this has to be disabled if all three ray engine cores are enabled, however.</p>

<p>So that’s a broad overview of the system - I intend to post some articles giving more details of how individual components work in the near future. In the meantime, though, if you have any questions or thoughts then please get in touch and I’ll do my best to answer!</p>

<p>Many thanks to Matt, Jaymin, Rick and everyone else who has helped with advice, inspiration and support!</p>

			<p> Web development has become a very complex field with many branches and tools to master. In this article, I suggest doing the inverse and use just a simple `index.html` file to manage all of the web app development scripts and assets. This might seem radical but does it make life more complex than using all those front-end tools we have become accustomed to? </p>

<p><em>"It might work for small things, but I wouldn't use it for something big."</em>
Said someone about something.</p>
<p>These are some of the things that an <code>index.html</code> typically does:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sets the title for the current page</li>
<li>Defines the content and assets</li>
<li>Defines content to be used as a template</li>
<li>Loads styles</li>
<li>Runs scripts and resolves modules dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>Which are already quite good, but there are many more goodies to be found among the things that a simple <code>index.html</code> allows to do such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest">manifest file</a> for offline usage of the page items</li>

</ul>
<p>In fact, everything that any modern complex Web App does can be fit into a single <code>index.html</code> file.</p>
<p>It is mostly a matter of managing the complexity and growth of files, assets, components, etc...</p>
<p>We have developed a wide range of very complex tools to help us with that. Front-end development has become so complex that it is hard for any single person to master it.</p>
<p>How much harder would life be if a single <code>index.html</code> was used to drive all of the development instead of all those Create-React-App/Babel/WebPack/npm/yarn/d/sass/styled-components/optimizers? </p>
<p>I don't know how to answer this but will try to shed some light on a simpler, more "naked" approach for web app development.</p>
<p>To start <strong>there are at least two problems</strong> with using a single <code>index.html</code> as the only management file for the app:</p>
<ul>
<li>No TypeScript support (or any other transpiler language, only JS, GLSL, and WebASM supported)</li>
<li>No way to easily manage 3rd party dependencies dependencies (dependencies)</li>
</ul>
<p>These two will be the subject of my next post. For now, I am going to lay the ground for a simple <code>index.html</code>-only approach.</p>
<h2 id="a-common-structure-for-most-apps">A common structure for most apps</h2>
<p>The common structure I plan to follow is something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>&lt;!-- Page meta --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;link&gt;'s go here after the meta stuff --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;script type="module"&gt;'s go here --&gt;
</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt; </span><span>&lt;!-- Feature flags as class strings in body --&gt;
  &lt;!-- Modals go here --&gt;
  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
    </span><span>&lt;!-- The content being shown goes here --&gt;
  </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
  </span><span>&lt;!-- &lt;template&gt;'s go here --&gt;
  &lt;!-- &lt;script&gt;'s go here at the end --&gt;
</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>This structure makes some compromises but overall is enough for most complex apps. It is not that different from a normal HTML page 🧐.</p>
<p>JavaScript modules are being loaded at the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, which is ok because module scripts are deferred by default and do not block the parsing of the rest of the document. They could go anywhere, I prefer to keep the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> for the main logic and more immediate scripts.</p>
<p>With this in mind, here are 3 common things to a web app that can be done in such a simple structure without much effort:</p>
<ol>
<li>Global loading state (full-screen loading)</li>
<li>Routing (what to show according to the URL being rendered)</li>
<li>Place common HTML parts/assets without repeating them (templating/components)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="global-loading-page">Global Loading page</h2>
<p>A loading page that fills the whole screen is something that most web apps have, some even distract us with cool animations while loading.</p>
<p>In the above structure, the loading page goes into the modal area. Right before the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> content. This allows heavy content like <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> to be placed as <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> children and fully load (shaders, image data, etc) behind it, before clearing the loading state and showing them to our friends.</p>
<pre><code><span>...
&lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>div </span><span>id</span><span>="</span><span>loading</span><span>"&gt;Loading&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
  ...
</span></code></pre>
<p>The whole visible space gets covered with that loading <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> which is then removed when all the things that the app needs for a good first run are ready.</p>
<p>Having the loading upfront on the <code>index.html</code> without needing any JS to first show it also helps our karma score in the bots&amp;spiders purgatory that purge the web we all love into useful cinder blocks.</p>
<h2 id="routing">Routing</h2>
<p>No lib is going to be used for routing. Routing is going to consist of simple manipulations of the browser history with <code>popstate</code> and <code>pushstate</code>. The basic approach is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read the current route from the window location</li>
<li>Clone its corresponding <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> into the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag</li>
<li>Inside it adjust the relevant <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>'s and other link navigation tags to perform a <code>pushState</code> instead of their default behavior
<ul>
<li>Filters can be applied to only consider <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>'s that have relative paths, or that do not have the <code>rel=nofollow</code> attribute</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>onpopstate</code> clone the correspnoding <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> into the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag</li>
</ol>
<p>This is intended only for web apps as an effort to reduce the amount of JS and leverage the features already at hand. For anything similar to regular pages the browser behavior is more than good enough, no need for JS there.</p>
<p>This approach should work well if the web app uses less than 20 or 15 possible routing patterns. Most web apps likely average at some number under 10. This simple approach should be more than enough. There is no need in my foreseeable use cases to use anything more complex like the DOM or any big library to manage routes.</p>
<p>I will evolve this into a very simple routing/templating library to be announced soon(ish). For reference, here is some code that I did for a template engine in one of the many Grid iterations: <a href="https://hugodaniel.com/scripts/meander.js">old routing code</a>.</p>
<p>I appreciate the browser's approach of associating page state with history, however, for a web app I find it simpler and more manageable to keep these two things separate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Routing seen as pure functions of navigation only transformations</li>
<li>App state in its own separate tarpit.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="html-templating">HTML Templating</h2>
<p>Stamping and repeating a common HTML structure in a couple of places is a frequent routine that most web apps do. Be it for menu entries, list items, or even whole parts like sidebars or modal and toast elements. Finding a common HTML structure and repeat it when needed with small adjustments is a stapled practice.</p>
<p>HTML templating has many technicalities and possibilities. Most JS frameworks commonly solve it in their own way with different degrees of justifiable complexity.</p>
<p>Web browsers already provide a very flexible and complex way to do templating through the Web Components suite of technologies. For most of my cases plain HTML will be prefered and written directly at that <code>index.html</code>. For the other cases where DRY speaks louder a simple static "copy/paste" tag will suffice, a small prototype of this could be something like:</p>
<pre><code><span>customElements</span><span>.</span><span>define</span><span>("</span><span>template-content</span><span>", </span><span>class extends </span><span>HTMLElement </span><span>{
  </span><span>constructor</span><span>() {
    </span><span>super</span><span>();
    </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>attachShadow</span><span>({ mode: </span><span>"</span><span>open</span><span>" </span><span>})
        .</span><span>appendChild</span><span>(
          document.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(
            </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>getAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>from-id</span><span>'</span><span>)
          ).content.</span><span>cloneNode</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>))
  }
}</span><span>);
</span></code></pre>
<p>This small code defines a new WebComponent tag <code>&lt;template-content&gt;</code>, this tag reads an element id from its <code>from-id</code> attribute, then gets the corresponding element on the DOM for that id, clones it, and replaces itself with it.</p>
<p>This is useful because it provides a quick way to stamp HTML/SVG content on the document. Helpful to replicate SVG elements, lists, and node sub-trees on the client-side.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>nav</span><span>&gt;
	&lt;</span><span>button </span><span>onclick</span><span>="</span><span>tool</span><span>('</span><span>undo</span><span>')"&gt;
		&lt;</span><span>template-content </span><span>from-id</span><span>="</span><span>tools-button-content</span><span>" /&gt;
		&lt;</span><span>template-content </span><span>from-id</span><span>="</span><span>tools-undo</span><span>" /&gt;
	&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;
	&lt;</span><span>button </span><span>onclick</span><span>="</span><span>tool</span><span>('</span><span>draw</span><span>')"&gt;
		&lt;</span><span>template-content </span><span>from-id</span><span>="</span><span>tools-button-content</span><span>" /&gt;
		&lt;</span><span>template-content </span><span>from-id</span><span>="</span><span>tools-draw</span><span>" /&gt;
	&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>nav</span><span>&gt;

&lt;</span><span>template </span><span>id</span><span>="</span><span>tools-button-content</span><span>"&gt;
</span><span>&lt;!-- Some complex content here --&gt;
</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>template</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>template </span><span>id</span><span>="</span><span>tools-draw</span><span>"&gt;
</span><span>&lt;!-- Some other complex content here --&gt;
</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>template</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Keeping a single <code>index.html</code> might be just enough for a simpler naked approach to app development. If there is no need for big dependencies, versioning tracking files, transpilers, and all that, this could very well be good enough. It works directly on top of what browsers already provide and hints at a simpler, leaner, style of development.</p>
<p>It does not have TypeScript support and it also does not automatically resolve dependencies and bundles them.</p>
<p>These are two open problems with this approach that I plan to show a possible solution that is on par in simplicity with this one. That will be the subject of my next technical post (likely to come out next week). Stay tuned.</p>

            <h2>Enumerating Trees</h2>

            <p>
    Posted on December 14, 2020
</p>



<p>Consider the following puzzle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given a list of <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math> labels, list all the trees with those labels in order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For instance, given the labels [1,2,3,4], the answer (for binary trees) is the following:</p>
<pre><code>┌1     ┌1      ┌1     ┌1     ┌1
┤      ┤      ┌┤     ┌┤     ┌┤
│┌2    │ ┌2   ││┌2   │└2    │└2
└┤     │┌┤    │└┤    ┤     ┌┤
 │┌3   ││└3   │ └3   │┌3   │└3
 └┤    └┤     ┤      └┤    ┤
  └4    └4    └4      └4   └4</code></pre>
<p>This problem (the “enumeration” problem) turns out to be quite fascinating and deep, with connections to parsing and monoids. It’s also just a classic algorithmic problem which is fun to try and solve.</p>
<p>The most general version of the algorithm is on forests of rose trees:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>data</span> <span>Rose</span> a <span>=</span> a <span>:&amp;</span> <span>Forest</span> a</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span>type</span> <span>Forest</span> a <span>=</span> [<span>Rose</span> a]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It’s worth having a go at attempting it yourself, but if you’d just like to see the slick solutions the following is one I’m especially proud of:</p>
<details>
<summary>Solution to the Enumeration Problem on Forests of Rose Trees</summary>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>enumForests ::</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Forest</span> a]</span>
<span id="cb3-2">enumForests <span>=</span> foldrM f []</span>
<span id="cb3-3">  <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb3-4">    f x xs <span>=</span> <span>zipWith</span> ((<span>:</span>) <span>.</span> (<span>:&amp;</span>) x) (inits xs) (tails xs)</span></code></pre></div>
</details>
<p>In the rest of this post I’ll go through the intuition behind solutions like the one above and I’ll try to elucidate some of the connections to other areas of computer science.</p>

<p>I first came across the enumeration problem when I was writing my master’s thesis: I needed to prove (in Agda) that there were finitely many binary trees of a given size, and that I could list them (this proof was part of a larger verified solver for the countdown problem). My first few attempts were unsuccessful: the algorithm presented in the countdown paper <span data-cites="hutton_countdown_2002">(Hutton <a href="#ref-hutton_countdown_2002" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span> was not structurally recursive, and did not seem amenable to Agda-style proofs.</p>
<p>Instead, I looked for a type which was isomorphic to binary trees, and which might be easier to reason about. One such type is Dyck words.</p>

<p>A “Dyck word” is a string of balanced parentheses.</p>
<pre><code>()()
(()())()
(())()</code></pre>
<p>It’s (apparently) well-known that these strings are isomorphic to binary trees (although the imperative descriptions of algorithms which actually computed this isomorphism addled my brain), but what made them interesting for me was that they are a <em>flat</em> type, structured like a linked list, and as such should be reasonably straightforward to prove to be finite.</p>
<p>Our first task, then, is to write down a type for Dyck words. Te following is a first possibility:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>data</span> <span>Paren</span> <span>=</span> <span>LParen</span> <span>|</span> <span>RParen</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><span>type</span> <span>Dyck</span> <span>=</span> [<span>Paren</span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But this type isn’t correct. It includes many values which <em>don’t</em> represent balanced parentheses, i.e.&nbsp;the expressions <code>[LParen,RParen] :: Dyck</code> are well-typed. To describe dyck words properly we’ll need to reach for the GADTs:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>data</span> <span>DyckSuff</span> (<span>n ::</span> <span>Nat</span>)<span> ::</span> <span>Type</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2">  <span>Done</span><span> ::</span> <span>DyckSuff</span> <span>Z</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3">  <span>Open</span><span> ::</span> <span>DyckSuff</span> (<span>S</span> n) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>DyckSuff</span> n</span>
<span id="cb6-4">  <span>Clos</span><span> ::</span> <span>DyckSuff</span> n     <span>-&gt;</span> <span>DyckSuff</span> (<span>S</span> n)</span>
<span id="cb6-5"></span>
<span id="cb6-6"><span>type</span> <span>Dyck</span> <span>=</span> <span>DyckSuff</span> <span>Z</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first type here represents suffixes of Dyck words; a value of type <code>DyckSuff n</code> represents a string of parentheses which is balanced except for <code>n</code> extraneous closing parentheses. <code>DyckSuff Z</code>, then, has no extraneous closing parens, and as such is a proper Dyck word.</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>Open</span> <span>$</span> <span>Clos</span> <span>$</span> <span>Open</span> <span>$</span> <span>Clos</span> <span>$</span> <span>Done</span><span> ::</span> <span>Dyck</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2">()()</span>
<span id="cb7-3"></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>Clos</span> <span>$</span> <span>Open</span> <span>$</span> <span>Clos</span> <span>$</span> <span>Done</span><span> ::</span> <span>DyckSuff</span> (<span>S</span> <span>Z</span>)</span>
<span id="cb7-5">)()</span>
<span id="cb7-6"></span>
<span id="cb7-7"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>Open</span> <span>$</span> <span>Open</span> <span>$</span> <span>Clos</span> <span>$</span> <span>Open</span> <span>$</span> <span>Clos</span> <span>$</span> <span>Clos</span> <span>$</span> <span>Open</span> <span>$</span> <span>Clos</span> <span>$</span> <span>Done</span><span> ::</span> <span>Dyck</span></span>
<span id="cb7-8">(()())()</span>

<span id="cb7-11">(())()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The next task is to actually enumerate these words. Here’s an <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">O(n)</annotation></semantics></math> algorithm which does just that:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>enumDyck ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Dyck</span>]</span>

<span id="cb8-21"><span>"(()())"</span></span>
<span id="cb8-22"><span>"((()))"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>A variant of this function was what I needed in my thesis: I also needed to prove that it produced every possible value of the type <code>Dyck</code>, which was not too difficult.</p>
<p>The difficult part is still ahead, though: now we need to convert between this type and a binary tree.</p>

<p>First, for the conversion algorithms we’ll actually need another GADT:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>infixr</span> <span>5</span> <span>:-</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><span>data</span> <span>Stack</span> (<span>a ::</span> <span>Type</span>) (<span>n ::</span> <span>Nat</span>)<span> ::</span> <span>Type</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3">  <span>Nil</span><span>  ::</span> <span>Stack</span> a <span>Z</span></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><span>  (:-) ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> a n <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> a (<span>S</span> n)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The familiar length-indexed vector will be extremely useful for the next few bits of code: it will act as a stack in our stack-based algorithms. Here’s one of those algorithms now:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><span>dyckToTree ::</span> <span>Dyck</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Tree</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2">dyckToTree dy <span>=</span> go dy (<span>Leaf</span> <span>:-</span> <span>Nil</span>)</span>
<span id="cb10-3">  <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb10-4"><span>    go ::</span> <span>DyckSuff</span> n <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> <span>Tree</span> (<span>S</span> n) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Tree</span></span>
<span id="cb10-5">    go (<span>Open</span> d) ts               <span>=</span> go d (<span>Leaf</span> <span>:-</span> ts)</span>
<span id="cb10-6">    go (<span>Clos</span> d) (t1 <span>:-</span> t2 <span>:-</span> ts) <span>=</span> go d (t2 <span>:*:</span> t1 <span>:-</span> ts)</span>
<span id="cb10-7">    go <span>Done</span>     (t  <span>:-</span> <span>Nil</span>)      <span>=</span> t</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This might be familiar: it’s actually shift-reduce parsing dressed up with some types. The nice thing about it is that it’s completely total: all pattern-matches are accounted for here, and when written in Agda it’s clearly structurally terminating.</p>
<p>The function in the other direction is similarly simple:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><span>treeToDyck ::</span> <span>Tree</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Dyck</span></span>
<span id="cb11-2">treeToDyck t <span>=</span> go t <span>Done</span></span>
<span id="cb11-3">  <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb11-4"><span>    go ::</span> <span>Tree</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>DyckSuff</span> n <span>-&gt;</span> <span>DyckSuff</span> n</span>
<span id="cb11-5">    go <span>Leaf</span>        <span>=</span> <span>id</span></span>
<span id="cb11-6">    go (xs <span>:*:</span> ys) <span>=</span> go xs <span>.</span> <span>Open</span> <span>.</span> go ys <span>.</span> <span>Clos</span></span></code></pre></div>

<p>Much of this stuff has been on my mind recently because of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_IINWzQhow">this</a> <span data-cites="riley_program_2020">(<a href="#ref-riley_program_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> video on the computerphile channel, in which Graham Hutton goes through using QuickCheck to test an interesting compiler. The compiler itself is explored more in depth in <span data-cites="bahr_calculating_2015">Bahr and Hutton (<a href="#ref-bahr_calculating_2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>, where the algorithms developed are really quite similar to those that we have here.</p>
<p>The advantage of the code above is that it’s all <em>total</em>: we will never pop items off the stack that aren’t there. This is a nice addition, and it’s surprisingly simple to add: let’s see if we can add it to the compiler presented in the paper.</p>
<p>The first thing we need to change is we need to add a payload to our tree type: the one above is just the <em>shape</em> of a binary tree, but the language presented in the paper contains values.</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><span>data</span> <span>Expr</span> (<span>a ::</span> <span>Type</span>) <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb12-2">  <span>Val</span><span>   ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Expr</span> a</span>
<span id="cb12-3"><span>  (:+:) ::</span> <span>Expr</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Expr</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Expr</span> a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We’ll need to change the definition of <code>Dyck</code> similarly:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1"><span>data</span> <span>Code</span> (<span>n ::</span> <span>Nat</span>) (<span>a ::</span> <span>Type</span>)<span> ::</span> <span>Type</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2">  <span>HALT</span><span> ::</span> <span>Code</span> (<span>S</span> <span>Z</span>) a</span>
<span id="cb13-3">  <span>PUSH</span><span> ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Code</span> (<span>S</span> n) a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Code</span> n a</span>
<span id="cb13-4">  <span>ADD</span><span>  ::</span> <span>Code</span> (<span>S</span> n) a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Code</span> (<span>S</span> (<span>S</span> n)) a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After making it so that these data structures can now store contents, there are two other changes worth pointing out:</p>
<ul>
<li>The names have been changed, to match those in the paper. It’s a little clearer now that the Dyck word is a bit like code for a simple stack machine.</li>
<li>The numbering on <code>Code</code> has changed. Now, the <code>HALT</code> constructor has a parameter of <code>1</code> (well, <code>S Z</code>), where its corresponding constructor in <code>Dyck</code> (<code>Done</code>) had <code>0</code>. Why is this? I am not entirely sure! To get this stuff to all work out nicely took a huge amount of trial and error, I would love to see a more principled reason why the numbering changed here.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these definitions we can actually transcribe the <code>exec</code> and <code>comp</code> functions almost verbatim <span data-cites="bahr_calculating_2015">(from page 11 and 12 of <a href="#ref-bahr_calculating_2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><span>exec ::</span> <span>Code</span> n <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> <span>Int</span> (n <span>+</span> m) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> <span>Int</span> (<span>S</span> m)</span>
<span id="cb14-2">exec <span>HALT</span>         st              <span>=</span> st</span>
<span id="cb14-3">exec (<span>PUSH</span> v is)  st              <span>=</span> exec is (v <span>:-</span> st)</span>
<span id="cb14-4">exec (<span>ADD</span>    is) (t1 <span>:-</span> t2 <span>:-</span> st) <span>=</span> exec is (t2 <span>+</span> t1 <span>:-</span> st)</span>
<span id="cb14-5"></span>
<span id="cb14-6"><span>comp ::</span> <span>Expr</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Code</span> <span>Z</span> a</span>
<span id="cb14-7">comp e <span>=</span> comp' e <span>HALT</span></span>
<span id="cb14-8">  <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb14-9"><span>    comp' ::</span> <span>Expr</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Code</span> (<span>S</span> n) a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Code</span> n a</span>
<span id="cb14-10">    comp' (<span>Val</span>     x) <span>=</span> <span>PUSH</span> x</span>
<span id="cb14-11">    comp' (xs <span>:+:</span> ys) <span>=</span> comp' xs <span>.</span> comp' ys <span>.</span> <span>ADD</span></span></code></pre></div>

<p>As I have mentioned, a big benefit of all of this stuff is that it can be translated into Agda readily. The real benefit of <em>that</em> is that we can show the two representations of programs are fully isomorphic. I have proven this <a href="https://github.com/oisdk/agda-playground/blob/d7234c276f063dbb4a2d2cbcedb86dd48501a908/Data/Dyck/Payload.agda">here</a>: the proof is surprisingly short (about 20 lines), and the rest of the code follows the Haskell stuff quite closely. I got the idea for much of the proof from <a href="https://gist.github.com/Boarders/9d83f9cbcfaffb04cf2464588fc46df9">this</a> bit of code by <a href="https://boarders.github.io/">Callan McGill</a> <span data-cites="mcgill_compiler_2020">(<a href="#ref-mcgill_compiler_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>I’ll include it here as a reference.</p>

      <p>As your blog grows and you <a href="https://draft.dev/learn/posts/finding-motivating-writers">get more writers to contribute</a>, you need to build documents and processes to help you maintain high quality and consistent style. To serve this goal, you should create a style guide to help writers and editors stay on the same page.</p>

<p>Generally, <strong>a style guide includes expectations for your contributors</strong>. Depending on your priorities, you may include more or less information than we do at <a href="https://draft.dev/">Draft.dev</a>, but our style guide should give you an excellent place to start. We send this style guide to all new contributors to ensure they are familiar with our expectations, and we refer to this guide throughout the editing process.</p>

<p>Of course, ours is not the only example of a technical writing style guide. If you’re looking to compare your options, check out <a href="https://developers.google.com/style">Google’s developer documentation style guide</a>, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/digitalocean-s-technical-writing-guidelines">DigitalOcean’s technical writing guidelines</a>, and some of the <a href="https://medium.com/technical-writing-is-easy/style-guides-for-technical-writers-72b011f84c4b">other guides here</a>. If you’re creating a style guide, I’d recommend reading over several and deciding what you want to include in yours.</p>

<h2 id="the-draftdev-technical-blogging-style-guide">The Draft.dev Technical Blogging Style Guide</h2>

<p>At <a href="https://draft.dev/">Draft.dev</a>, we specialize in creating technical blog content for companies that want to reach software engineers. While most of our writers are software engineers first and authors second, we still expect them to follow consistent standards for each of our clients.</p>

<p>Below is our style guide, which is broken up into four sections:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#voice">Voice</a></li>
  <li><a href="#content">Content</a></li>
  <li><a href="#conventions">Conventions</a></li>
  <li><a href="#communication">Communication</a></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="voice">Voice</h3>

<h4 id="write-in-second-person">Write in Second Person</h4>
<p>Speak to your readers directly using “you” and “your.” Avoid “we” and “our.”</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can use a web browser (like Chrome, Safari, or Edge) to access web sites on the internet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bad:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We can use our web browsers (like Chrome, Safari, or Edge) to access web sites on the internet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="use-conversational-business-appropriate-language">Use Conversational, Business-Appropriate Language</h4>
<p>Read your article out loud and ask yourself, “Would I talk like this at work?” Use your real-world experience, but avoid jargon when possible.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Experts agree that the internet was not the product of any individual mind, but a series of advances in networking and computer science.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bad:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many scholars would agree that, had it not been for active networks, the simulation of Lamport clocks might never have occurred. The notion that end-users synchronize with the investigation of Markov models is rarely outdated. A theoretical grand challenge in theory is the important unification of virtual machines and real-time theory. To what extent can web browsers be constructed to achieve this purpose?</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="dont-repeat-yourself">Don’t Repeat Yourself</h4>
<p>Eliminate wordiness. You shouldn’t repeat yourself when programming, and you shouldn’t repeat yourself when writing.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A lively debate rages among software developers. The contentious issue is: tabs or spaces?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bad:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is currently a lively, ongoing controversy among many computer scientists and other professional in the field of software development: theories are being spun and arguments are being conducted among them about whether the use of tabs to designate indentation in a document is superior to the use of spaces for the same purpose.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="content">Content</h3>

<h4 id="the-introduction">The Introduction</h4>
<p>Every article should have a 1-3 paragraph introduction. This introduction should accomplish two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Briefly tell readers what the article is about.</li>
  <li>Hook your readers. Give them a reason to continue reading.</li>
</ol>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I remember the first time I built user preferences into an app. At first, users just needed to be able to opt in or out of our weekly emails. “No big deal,” I thought, “I’ll just add a new field on the Users table.” For a while, that was fine. A few weeks later, my boss asked me if we could let users opt into push notifications. Fine, that’s just one more column on the database. Can’t hurt, right?</p>

  <p>You probably see where this is going.</p>

  <p>Within months, my user table had 40 columns, and while Postgres can handle it, it gets pretty tricky for new devs to keep up with all of them.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Postgres provides rich support for JSON fields, which can be very handy in situations like mine. Both JSON data types (<code>json</code> and <code>jsonb</code>) allow you to store entire objects or lists directly in your database. This means that you can store any number of user preferences in one column.</p>

  <p>In this post, I’ll show you how to use Postgres’ JSON fields in a Django web application. You’ll learn about the differences between <code>json</code> and <code>jsonb</code>, how to query JSON data and some of the drawbacks of storing your data in JSON.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bad (no “hook”):</p>

</blockquote>

<h4 id="support-claims-with-evidence">Support Claims With Evidence</h4>
<p>For every claim you make, ask yourself, “How can I prove this?” You can do this by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Including a link to a reputable article</li>
  <li>Including a quote from another source</li>
  <li>Citing an academic study</li>
  <li>Linking to the official documentation</li>
  <li>Interviewing knowledgeable professionals</li>
</ul>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While [Postgres can handle hundreds of columns](https://nerderati.com/2017/01/03/postgresql-tables-can-have-at-most-1600-columns/), it might not be a good idea to take advantage of this feature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bad:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While I’m guessing Postgres can handle a lot of columns, it might not be a good idea to use more than a hundred if you can help it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="the-conclusion">The Conclusion</h4>
<p>Every article should include a 1-2 paragraph conclusion. This should restate the thesis of the article and remind readers what they learned. It may also include other resources readers can reference to learn more.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While JSON data types come with some drawbacks, they are useful when you need more flexibility in your data structure. Thanks to Django’s native support for `jsonb`, you can get started using JSON data in your web applications without [learning all the native Postgres query operators](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html).</p>

  <p>Next time you need more flexibility in your data model and want to benefit from the strengths of Postgres give `jsonb` fields a try.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="conventions">Conventions</h3>

<h4 id="write-in-markdown">Write in Markdown</h4>
<p>All articles should be written in <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">Markdown</a> and submitted in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/">Google Doc</a> sent to you when you accept the assignment.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Markdown is a formatting language often *used by static site generators* and *blogs*. If you aren’t familiar with its syntax, you can [click here to learn more](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="upload-images-to-imgur">Upload Images to <a href="https://imgur.com/">Imgur</a></h4>
<p>If you have screenshots or diagrams in your article, upload them to <a href="https://imgur.com/">Imgur’s free image hosting service</a> and embed them using Markdown. Include descriptive text inside the brackets (<code>[...]</code>) so that screen readers can describe the image.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>![A diagram showing different computer hardware](https://i.imgur.com/hBE7ZF8.jpg)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bad:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>![](https://www.my-private-image-server.net/image-1.png)</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Headers make your content more scannable. Use <code>##</code>, <code>###</code>, and <code>####</code> header tags to denote different sections. Headings should be written in <a href="https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case">title case</a>.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>## How to Use JSON Fields in Your Python Application</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>### The Two JSON Formats Supported by Postgres</p>

  <p>…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bad (not title case):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>## How to use JSON fields in your Python application</p>

  <p>…
### The two JSON formats supported by Postgres</p>

  <p>…</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="denote-code-with-backticks">Denote Code with Backticks</h4>
<p>Use code blocks when the code is one or more lines long or deserves special emphasis.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>```</p>

  <p>function snafu() {</p>

  <p>return null;</p>

  <p>}</p>

  <p>```</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bad:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>`function snafu() {</p>

  <p>return null;</p>

  <p>}`</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Use inline code when referring to a variable name or short command in context.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Call the `snafu()` method to exit and return to your command line.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bad:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Call the “snafu()” method to exit and return to your command line.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="use-double-quotes-for-quotations">Use Double Quotes for Quotations</h4>
<p>Use blockquotes when the quote is two or more lines long.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some text leading up to the quote.</p>

  <p>&gt; “The field/element/path extraction operators return NULL, rather than failing, if the JSON input does not have the right structure to match the request; for example if no such key or array element exists.”</p>

  <p>Some text after the quote.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bad:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some text leading up to the quote. “The field/element/path extraction operators return NULL, rather than failing, if the JSON input does not have the right structure to match the request; for example if no such key or array element exists.” Some text after the quote.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Use inline quotes when the quote is relatively short or when you’re referencing a single word or phrase.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There’s nothing to see here,” said Davies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bad:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&gt; “There’s nothing to see here.” - Davies</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="use-emphasis-sparingly">Use Emphasis Sparingly</h4>
<p>Use <em>italics</em> to emphasize text or use <strong>bold</strong> to suggest strong emphasis.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is *nothing* as important as using **spaces** to indent your code.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>

<h4 id="communicate-delays-and-roadblocks-to-your-editor-proactively">Communicate Delays and Roadblocks to Your Editor Proactively</h4>
<p>You will not be penalized for late work if you’ve been in communication with us about the assignment. We can offer technical help and extensions, but you must ask two or more days before the due date.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

																										<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In an exclusive feature for&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, U.S. military and intelligence officials, as well as Pentagon emails, offer an unprecedented glimpse behind the scenes of what’s currently going on with The Pentagon’s investigation into UFOs, or as they term them, “Unidentified Aerial Phenomena” (UAP).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For the last two years, the Department of Defense’s newly revamped “Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force” (or UAPTF) has been busy briefing lawmakers, Intelligence Community stakeholders, and the highest levels of the U.S. military on encounters with what they say are mysterious airborne objects that defy conventional explanations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Along with classified briefings, multiple senior U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the matter say two classified intelligence reports on UAP have been widely distributed to the U.S. Intelligence Community. Numerous sources from various government agencies told&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that these reports include clear photographic evidence of UAP. The reports also explicitly state that the Task Force is considering the possibility that these unidentified objects could, as stated by one source from the U.S. Intelligence Community said, be operated by “intelligences of unknown origin.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Significantly, a retired U.S. Air Force brigadier general and head of RAND corporation’s Space Enterprise Initiative has—for the first time—gone on record to discuss some of the most likely explanations for UAP. His responses were surprising.</span></p>

<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Briefings At The Highest Levels&nbsp;</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In June, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s </span><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CRPT-116srpt233/pdf/CRPT-116srpt233.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">FY2021 Intelligence Authorization Act</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> contained an intriguing section titled report on “Advanced Aerial Threats.” In the inclusion, the committee gave an eye-opening official hint (in recent history) the government takes UFOs seriously by offering its support for the “efforts of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon Task Force at the Office of Naval Intelligence.” The Intelligence Committee additionally requested an unclassified report detailing the analysis of “UAP” or “Anomalous Aerial Vehicles.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Though already acknowledged by the Intelligence Committee, in mid-August, the Pentagon&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.thedebrief.org/the-dod-has-officially-announced-it-has-a-uap-task-force-heres-what-that-means/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">formally acknowledged</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;they had established a task force looking into UAP. In a press announcement, the Secretary of Defense’s Office&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2314065/establishment-of-unidentified-aerial-phenomena-task-force/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">stated</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, “the UAPTF’s mission will be to detect, analyze and catalog UAPs that could potentially pose a threat to U.S. national security.” According to the release, authority for the Task Force was approved by the DoD’s chief operating officer, Deputy Secretary of Defense David L. Norquist.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The summer news of the establishment of the UAPTF seemingly suggests—for the first time since the shuttering of Project Blue Book (the Air Force’s official investigations into UFOs) in 1969—that the Pentagon is now taking the subject of UFOs seriously.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, an internal email obtained by&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">shows that almost one year before the DoD’s announcement, the highest levels of the U.S. military were already being briefed on UAP.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The email, obtained via Freedom of Information Act request, shows an October 16th, 2019 exchange between then Vice Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Robert Burke, and current Vice Chief of Staff for the Air Force General Stephen “Steve” Wilson.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the email, Adm. Burke tells Gen. Wilson, “Recommend you take the brief I just received from our Director of Naval Intelligence VADM Matt Kohler, on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP).” Adm. Burke concludes the email, “SECNAV [Secretary of the Navy] will get the same brief tomorrow at 1000.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The “SECNAV” referenced in Adm. Burke’s email was then-Secretary of the Navy, Richard V. Spencer. A little over a month after this UAP briefing, Spencer was fired by then-Secretary of Defense Mark Esper over public disagreements stemming from a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/28/navy-secretary-richard-spencer-donald-trump-navy-seal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">series of controversies&nbsp;</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">involving the court-martial of Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Speaking on background, one U.S. Defense official lamented that a lack of continuity with DoD leadership might have hindered some of the UAPTF’s work. Within the past 24 months, there have been four different Secretaries of the Navy and five additional Secretaries of Defense. Vice Admiral Matt Kohler, noted for having provided the briefings, retired after 36 years with the Navy in June of this year.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Reaching out to several active government officials and individuals who retain their government-issued security clearances,&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;learned that last fall was a busy time for the UAPTF.&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On October 21st, 2019, a briefing on UAP was conducted at the Pentagon for several Senate Armed Services Committee staffers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Attendees at the meeting told&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;that they were provided information on two previous DoD-backed UFO programs: The Advanced Aerial Weapons Systems Applications Program (AAWSAP) and the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). They were also briefed on “highly sensitive categories of UFO investigations.” Only two days later on October 23rd, staffers with the Senate Select Intelligence Committee were provided the same information in a meeting on Capitol Hill.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A former private contractor for AAWSAP and AATIP, Dr. Hal Puthoff, confirmed for&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">he was one of a handful of persons who conducted the October briefings. “I have been invited to brief congressional staffers on the Senate Armed Services Committee on UAP matters in the last couple of years,” Puthoff said in an email, “and have done so on more than one occasion.” Dr. Puthoff described the staffers during these meetings as being “engaged,” and provided “positive responses, [and] more details always being requested.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reached out to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Office and DoD Executive Services Office and formally requested an interview with someone authorized to speak on the UAP briefings with the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In an email, Senior Strategist and Pentagon spokesperson Susan Gough responded, “To maintain operations security, which includes not disseminating information publicly that may be useful to our adversaries, DOD does not discuss publicly the details of either the observations or the examination of reported incursions into our training ranges or designated airspace, including those incursions initially designated as UAP – and that includes not discussing the UAPTF publicly, also.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Official public affairs channels indicate the Pentagon is not interested in sharing any more information on the UAP topic. However, several current and former officials with the DoD and individuals working for multiple U.S. intelligence agencies told&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">that there was much more going on behind closed doors.</span></p>

<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">UAP Intelligence Position Reports</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Multiple sources confirmed for&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;that the UAPTF had issued two classified intelligence position reports, which one individual described as “shocking.” Details provided on these reports suggest both a greater degree of Pentagon involvement, and that the UAPTF’s&nbsp;hunt for unidentified objects isn’t confined only to aerial phenomena.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Two officials with the DoD and one from the U.S. Intelligence community were willing to provide details on the contents of the classified report. An additional three other U.S. Intelligence Officials and a federal law enforcement officer confirmed the report’s existence but were only willing to provide comments on their distribution. Given the report’s classification and their discussion of a “sensitive intelligence matter,” the officials we spoke with did so only under strict conditions of anonymity. While&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">has agreed not to provide information on sources, identities, and employers, though everyone we spoke with works within the U.S. Intelligence Community and under the authority of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One of the intelligence reports, released in 2018, is said to have provided a general overview of the UAP topic and included details of previous military encounters. According to sources who had read it, the report also contained an unreleased photograph of an “aerial phenomena” categorized as “unidentified.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">was told the accompanying photo was captured from within the cockpit of an F/A-18 fighter jet with a pilot’s personal cell phone. According to three U.S. officials who had seen it, the photo showed an unidentified silver “cube-shaped” object. The report is said to have indicated the object was “hovering” or completely motionless when military pilots encountered it. All three officials agreed that based on the photo, the object appeared to be at an altitude of roughly 30,000 to 35,000 feet and approximately 1,000 feet from the fighter jet.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Defense and intelligence officials willing to discuss the report and those who only wished to confirm its dissemination all expressed shock that it had been so widely distributed amongst the Intelligence community.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“In decades with the [Intelligence Community] I’ve never seen anything like this,” said one intelligence official.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One defense official described the report’s distribution as having gone through “normal, non-public, information sharing channels.” Other officials who’d seen and read the report either declined to elaborate or indicated the report was distributed on various secure systems. One defense official indicated it was distributed on the DoD’s Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet). Two other intelligence officials said they received the information via “NSANet” (the NSA’s official intranet). An additional source said …</span></p></div></div></div>

To date, there exist multiple service mesh implementations with different architectural approaches ranging from smaller open-source projects to major endeavours being backed by big companies such as Google.

One example of this is resilience features, “probably” needed for every service you are to create. Instead of rewriting resilience libraries for every service in your application, yes services (they can be in different languages). You instead throw a service mesh in the mix and it’s done without modifying your service. So now you probably asking yourself, what is this magic? It’s actually a pretty easy solution.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>A services mesh works by intercepting all communication to and from a service. Traffic interception is usually done by deploying proxy instances beside each service, so called sidecar injection, referring the proxy as the sidecar. This allows the service mesh to intercept and manage traffic without application modification. This enables key features such as metric gathering (e.g. latency, error rate), traffic management (e.g. splitting traffic between services, replicating traffic for testing), security (applying authentication and encrypted communication between services with mTLS) and resilience (e.g. retries, timeouts and circuit braking). The behavior of the proxy instances are steered by a set of management components referred to as the control plane. All proxies running alongside the services in the mesh are usually referred to as the data plane.</span></p></div></div></div><div data-id="9a7f5c7" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default"><div><p><img width="532" height="310" src="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dahlberg-pod-injection.png?x58962" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dahlberg-pod-injection.png 532w, https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dahlberg-pod-injection-300x175.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px"></p></div></div><div data-id="3272f66" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p>A good article describing why service mesh are useful that also talks about how they work is, “The Service Mesh: What Every Software Engineer Needs to Know about the World’s Most Over-Hyped Technology” by William Morgan.

Its architecture follows the common approach of using sidecars to integrate into a microservice application. The architecture is divided into two main parts, a data plane and a control plane. The data plane represents the sidecars, intercepting and managing all network communication between services. The control plane manages and configures the behavior of data plane and the service mesh.</p></div></div><div data-id="db897be" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>Linkerd was for the first time released in 2016 by Buoyant.

This newer version was introduced in December, 2017 as a separate service mesh project called Conduit. Conduit was later on July 6, 2018 merged into the Linkerd as a separate Linkerd project creating Linkerd 2.0. This thesis henceforth studies Linkerd 2.x and refers to it as Linkerd.</p><p>To date, Linkerd only supports Kubernetes and actually requires it to run compared to Linkerd 1.x that supports multiple environments. The Linkerd architecture is based on the sidecars principle mentioned earlier. The architecture is divided into two parts: the control plane and date plane, the date plane represents the proxy servers running alongside each application and intercept all communication. The control plane is split up into several services control the behavior of the data plane and collect telemetry about the network and service mesh.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="bf8b410" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="8a7bf68" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="50e1811" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Feature comparison: Istio vs. Linkerd</h2></p></div><div data-id="1decf38" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>Linkerd is explicitly written for Kubernetes, to date only supporting Kubernetes. Istio is designed to run in any environment claiming to be platform-independent. To date, Istio runs on Kubernetes, Consul (alpha phase) and individual virtual machines (they can be connected into an existing Istio mesh deployed on Kubernetes).&nbsp;</p><p>Both meshes provide observability by using web-interfaces (dashboard) and preinstalled Grafana dashboards. Grafana is used to display information stored in the Prometheus datebase (e.g. CPU/memory of each pod and container). The web-interface is used to display and interact with the mesh, showing inject/uninjected pods and communication between services. Displaying golden metrics such as success rate, traffic (requests per second), latencies and saturation (system utilization). Both meshes provide distributed tracing but application modification is needed to propagate headers.&nbsp;</p><p>Resiliency features are also supported such as retries and timeouts, allowing the sidecar to retry failed requests and timeouts, if replies are too slow. Fault injection for introducing errors to services. Traffic shifting for dynamically shifting traffic between services. Istio also provides circuit breaking, that breaks all connection to a service after a fixed amount of concurrent connections of failed calls.&nbsp;</p><p>Security with authentication and encryption with mTLS are supported by both meshes. Linkerd automatically enables mTLS for most HTTP traffic, some gaps (e.g. Host header in HTTP request is an IP address). Istio has a strict mode that can be toggled to allow only traffic with mTLS or both mTLS and plain-text.</p><p>A shorter list of some of the features provided by both meshes:</p></div></div></div><div data-id="36c2aea" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default"><div><p><img width="612" height="499" src="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dahlberg-service-meshes.png?x58962" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dahlberg-service-meshes.png 612w, https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dahlberg-service-meshes-300x245.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px"></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="c10a6d6" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="752d98a" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="2db9a53" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Project maturity: Istio vs. Linkerd</h2></p></div><div data-id="1f53388" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>Both projects give a mature feeling by both having an increasing community growth with an established community governance.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Istio has, to date, 22.8 thousand stars and is steered by their Steering Committee formed to oversee the administrative aspects of the project, including governance, branding, and marketing.

<p>If you never heard of <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a>, it is a very
handy general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder. Besides command-line, it is
also a popular Vim plugin. If you’re wondering, a fuzzy finder is a tool that
helps you find what you’re looking for without needing to write the full name.</p>
<p>As a Vim user, I am always obsessed with doing a thing in the fewer keystrokes
as possible. Having the ability to open a file in Vim quickly is super useful to
me, and you will see why soon.</p>
<p>But, did you know that this fuzzy finder - fzf, can do a lot more than you
thought? Oh yeah, the fuzzy search is just the tip of the iceberg here.
It is like wine; the more you leave it on your computer, the more flavor and
sweetness it accumulates from that command-line. Let’s dive in and find out how
you can increase your productivity with fzf inside Vim.</p>
<h2 id="starting-off"><a href="#starting-off" aria-label="starting off permalink"></a>Starting off</h2>
<p>To be able to do the things I am doing in this blog post, you will need a couple of
plugins. If you’re not using <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug">vim-plug</a>
for installing other Vim plugins, then you are missing out. Go ahead and set
that up, and you can add the following:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>Plug <span>'junegunn/fzf'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>'do'</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> fzf#<span>install</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span>
Plug <span>'junegunn/fzf.vim'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then, install these plugins with <code>:PlugInstall</code> or use this shortcut I use:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>
nnoremap <span>&lt;</span><span>silent</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;</span>leader<span>&gt;</span><span>1</span> <span>:</span><span>source</span> ~<span>/</span><span>.</span>vimrc \| <span>:</span>PlugInstall<span>&lt;</span>CR<span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can then press your leader key and number 1 to install and apply all the
changes in your <code>.vimrc</code>.</p>
<p>Now, to the coolest part!</p>
<h2 id="the-magic-finder"><a href="#the-magic-finder" aria-label="the magic finder permalink"></a>The magic finder</h2>
<p>Everything we need is installed, and we can get to the practical part. As we
said before, fzf is a fuzzy finder, a file selector if you want. Let’s try
out that feature right off. To get the file picker opened, type <code>:Files</code> in
a Vim session. You should get something like this:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Open :Files" title="Open :Files" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/47be299b0a37790ebdd8396d20b872fa/fcda8/open-files.png" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/47be299b0a37790ebdd8396d20b872fa/12f09/open-files.png 148w,

    </span></p>
<p>What happened is fzf opened a small window at the bottom showing files in our
directory. If you look at the newly opened window, you will see the list of
files, and the <strong>preview</strong> of the currently selected file on the right
of the window. So you got your files on the left and their preview on the
right. Are you already impressed as I was? Cool, let’s move on.</p>
<p>If you don’t like the window, you can fine-tune easily with fzf customization
options. But if you want any fzf command in fullscreen, you can append <code>!</code> at
the end of the command. For example, let’s do <code>:Files!</code> and you should see the
following:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>

    </span></p>
<p>But, I don’t use <code>:Files</code> that often. As a matter of fact, I only use
<code>:GFiles</code> command by fzf. <code>:GFiles</code> will open a file picker for your Git files,
ignoring ones in the <code>.gitignore</code>. Using it is pretty neat in JavaScript
projects where <code>node_modules</code> files tend to kill the mood when running
<code>:Files</code>. Let us compare the same project with <code>:Files</code> and <code>:GFiles</code> commands:</p>

  Ah, that's better.
</p>
<p>Notice the difference? It feels like I just dropped a heavy backpack off my
back by not having those <code>node_modules/**</code> files popping up. Anyway, let’s see
this bad boy in action when searching for files to edit.</p>
<p><img src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/5a84a887e91f3aea28f8692bcc518fc0/gfiles-in-action.gif" alt=":GFiles in action GIF"></p>
<p>That’s it, and it is looking pretty good. Only thing I dislike about using <code>:GFiles</code> is
that it won’t include your new files unless you add them to the Git index with
<code>git add</code>. Also, I’d like some syntax highlighting to be there out of the box
when previewing files, but we will cover that in another blog post. In the
meantime, consider subscribing to the <a href="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/improving-vim-workflow-with-fzf/newsletter">newsletter</a> to get similar
posts like this.</p>
<p>To sum up, fzf is useful and quick as a flash when searching for files. And, as
Drake below says, resort to using <code>:GFiles</code> or try to configure <code>:Files</code> to
ignore certain files and paths.</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Drake fzf choices - go with :GFiles instead of :Files" title="Drake fzf choices - go with :GFiles instead of :Files" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/643d1c18c9fd8e42484fcaffaa4d99eb/41099/drake-no-files-yes-gfiles.jpg" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/643d1c18c9fd8e42484fcaffaa4d99eb/a80bd/drake-no-files-yes-gfiles.jpg 148w,

<p>To make this super fast for you, you can create a shortcut. I open <code>:GFiles</code>
with CTRL + p. I got left with this in my muscle memory from the legendary
<a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">ctrlp</a> plugin. To have <code>:GFiles</code> wired
up, so it opens with CTRL + p, you can add the following to your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>nnoremap <span>&lt;</span>C<span>-</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>GFiles<span>&lt;</span>Cr<span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="speed-search-your-project"><a href="#speed-search-your-project" aria-label="speed search your project permalink"></a>Speed search your project</h2>
<p>What blows my mind from time to time is other things you can do with fzf in
Vim. For example, you can use
<a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher">The Silver Searcher</a>
or
<a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> with fzf.
To search with The Silver Searcher, type <code>:Ag</code> and a term you want to
search. And, to search with ripgrep, type <code>:Rg</code> and the term. Of course, to
have these commands work, you need the respective libraries installed in your
environment.</p>
<p>I use <code>:Ag</code>, and it performs wonderfully. It is wired to CTRL + g for me,
so I access it quickly. To have this or a similar setup, add the following
to your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>

<p>The shortcut above will open up the <code>:Ag</code> search windows at the bottom with the
preview of the file. I find it super helpful and quick when I need to search
for a word in a project. Let’s see <code>:Ag</code> in action.</p>
<p><img src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/0c1dc6a8efd411223955dd76a20783a6/ag-in-action.gif" alt=":Ag in action"></p>
<h2 id="buffed-up"><a href="#buffed-up" aria-label="buffed up permalink"></a>Buffed up</h2>
<p>You can search all your open buffers with fzf by typing <code>:Buffers</code>. I keep a
shortcut at my leader key (the Space key, BTW) + b. Like so:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>nnoremap <span>&lt;</span><span>silent</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;</span>leader<span>&gt;</span><span>l</span> <span>:</span>Buffers<span>&lt;</span>CR<span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With that command, you will get a buffers explorer where you can quickly switch
between open files. I hope that helps. Let’s see how it looks:</p>

<p>If you are a fan of drawing inside the terminal, then you are going to love this one.
Try typing <code>:Commits</code> if you are using the <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">vim-fugitive</a> plugin.
The plugin by itself is a pretty awesome wrapper around Git, just if you
never want to leave the warmth of your Vim session. Anyways, if you type
<code>:Commits</code> you should get a tree of your project commits like so:</p>

<p>Pretty cool, huh? You can scroll up and down and checkout changes at each
commit. You can even enter the commit you are interested in and check out
changes made there. All of this is possible thanks to the <code>vim-fugitive</code>, so check
it out. A blog post about using Git inside Vim is coming, so be sure to
subscribe to the <a href="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/newsletter">newsletter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a-quick-summary"><a href="#a-quick-summary" aria-label="a quick summary permalink"></a>A quick summary</h2>
<p>Vim ecosystem has a lot of plugins, and fzf is one great plugin. You can search
for files with <code>:GFiles</code> and <code>:Files</code>. If you want to do a text search, try using
<code>:Ag</code> or <code>:Rg</code>, which use The Silver Searcher and ripgrep, respectively. Tired of
slow switching between open buffers - try out <code>:Buffers</code>. Or, if you want some
nice commit information, do <code>:Commits</code>.</p>
<p>These are just a couple of commands and tricks fzf has, be sure to check out
their README for more information. Also, stay tuned for more posts like these

<br/>
December 15, 2020 | https://sirupsen.com/shitlists/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sirupsen.com/shitlists/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-content">
    

    <p>Recently the team I work with completed a project to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UyDK2bDjc4">allow Shopify to run in
multiple datacenters</a>. This project
was a refactoring project in disguise. When you undertake large refactoring of a
code-base with 100s of developers and 100,000s of lines of code, you can’t align
by sending an email. The merge-conflicts a single pull request would entail
makes me shiver. When deprecating in a large code-base the only way to reliably
avoid new deprecated behaviour is a failing test that tells you what to do.
Otherwise the pace that new deprecated code is introduced can easily outpace the
speed at which you can remove them, or be a massive source of frustration.</p>
<p>Typically deprecations come in the form of soft warnings: Logging to <code>stderr</code>,
capital letters and exclamation marks in the documentation, or a legacy prefix
to the method or class name. At the end of the day, everyone needs to get work
done, and if they see a code-path already being used from 10 places in the
code-base despite these soft warnings–it doesn’t seem crazy to introduce
another. However, if another project is blocked on these deprecated code-paths,
piling on may have a large cost.</p>
<p>To solve this problem <a href="https://twitter.com/fw1729">Florian Weingarten</a> on our
team introduced what he calls “shitlists”: a whitelist of deprecated behaviour.
Existing deprecated behaviour is OK and whitelisted. New usage of the deprecated
API is banned and fails a test with a well-defined error.</p>
<p>They come in many forms, but could look like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>Shitlist</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>ClassA</span>,
  <span>ClassB</span>,
  <span>ClassC</span>
<span>]</span>

<span>def</span> <span>push_job_that_does_crazy_things</span>(klass)
  <span>if</span> <span>Shitlist</span><span>.</span>include?(klass)
    <span># Existing deprecated behaviour is called.</span>
  <span>else</span>
    <span>raise</span> <span>Shitlist</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span>, <span>&lt;&lt;-EOS
</span><span></span><span>You</span><span>'</span>re pushing a job that does crazy things<span>.</span> <span>This</span> <span>API</span> has been 
deprecated <span>in</span> this code<span>-</span>base<span>.</span> <span>&lt;</span>team<span>&gt;</span> is actively trying to get
rid of this code<span>-</span>path, because
<span>&lt;</span>reason<span>&gt;.</span> <span>We</span> suggest you instead <span>do</span> <span>&lt;</span>alternative<span>&gt;.</span> <span>If</span> you have questions, please
ping <span>&lt;</span>team<span>&gt;.</span>
  <span>EOS</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>A shitlist could be something as simple as a <code>git grep</code> for a certain code-path:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>test</span> <span>"no new introductions of legacy code path"</span> <span>do</span>
  actual <span>=</span> <span>`git grep some_legacy_method_with_a_unique_name`</span>
  assert_equal <span>321</span>, actual
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Other times you can reach into another API and get a count or shitlist:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>RedisShitlist</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>Session</span>,
  <span>FragmentCache</span>,
  <span>AuthenticationTokens</span>,
<span>]</span>

<span>test</span> <span>"no new redis models introduced"</span> <span>do</span>
  assert_equal <span>RedisShitlist</span>, <span>RedisModel</span><span>.</span>descendants
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Other ways we’ve used shitlists in the past:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that a certain datastore is only read from in a certain context (or
not used at all). This would allow for using a read-only slave, or improving
resiliency in a certain area.</li>
<li>Ensure fallbacks for all uses of a secondary data-store. E.g. if you access
sessions in Redis and Redis is down, you should be able to still render the
page (i.e. have an empty session fallback).</li>
<li>Shitlisting joins between tables that have no business being joined. This is
helpful to keep data-models and scope clean, or separating a part of an
application.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a linter for a project, you may be able to encode rules. For example
you might use <a href="http://www.foodcritic.io/">Foodcritic</a> for Chef, or
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">Rubocop</a> for Ruby.</p>
<p>Sometimes the shitlist is quite complicated, and much more domain-specific.</p>
<p>Building the shitlist gives the team responsible for it a number of advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Strong feedback loop.</strong> The goal is to reduce the <code>Shitlist</code> to an empty
Array and always raise or remove the code entirely. Remove a class from the
list, fix the code and the tests, celebrate and move on.</li>
<li><strong>Stopped the bleeding.</strong> New deprecated behaviour is not introduced unless
the team is contacted or some other action defined in the error is taken.</li>
<li><strong>Success metric</strong>. If you have shitlists for everything that needs to be
done for your project, you have metrics that you can track. Every week you
can look at how these lists are shrinking. Refactoring for months at a time
can be exhausting, but if you see that you’re making progress with metrics
moving, it’s much more rewarding.</li>
<li><strong>Enforces a guarantee</strong>. For example, you can have a shitlist that all jobs
have a retry mechanism. In that case, you know that you can kill any worker
gracefully at any time since the job will retry. Because of 1-3 you know how
much work it will take to have this guarantee.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important that the shitlist errors are actionable. If you hit the shitlist
of another team, you need to know what to do next. Ideally the error explains
exactly what you need to do, and no humans need to talk, but reaching out to the
owner of the shitlist should always be part of the shitlist.</p>
<p>If you own a shitlist, you must empathize with the problems of everyone who’s
running into problems. If you simply deprecate new behaviour and don’t offer an
alternative, you will be the source of frustration. If the value of emptying the
shitlist far outweighs the value of adding to the shitlist, it may be OK to not
offer a direct other solution but ask the person who ran into the error to
revise their solution.</p>
<p>It is important that people run into shitlists as early in development as
possible. If you run into a shitlist after spending hours implementing your
solution, you will be less than popular. Some shitlists may require an entire
re-architecting of some teams’ solutions.</p>
<p>Months, in our case more than a year, of refactoring can be overwhelming and
unrewarding work. With the strong feedback loop that shitlists introduce you can
see the light at the end of the tunnel. You know that nothing is added to the
shitlist without you knowing about it.</p>
<p>Creating shitlists in some cases can be extremely difficult. Some take hours to
create, others weeks, and in our case one took months to come up with. You’ll
have to place the cost of developing the shitlist against the cost of not having
it. In some cases logging when you hit a bad code-path may be enough (simple
soft warning deprecation) if you assert the risk of new behaviour small and the
complexity of introducing the shitlist big.</p>
<p>Delegating with shitlists is great. Due to the tight feedback loop, asking other
teams or onboarding new team members becomes much easier. Remove something on
the shitlist, fix the code and the tests, then move on. Sometimes during large
refactorings you may need other teams with more domain expertise of a certain
area of the code-base to help. The shitlist becomes a great rock to point people
at.</p>
<p>If you are about to embark on a large refactor, I highly recommend adding
shitlists to your toolbox. Your project will look much less daunting when it
goes from an opaque objective to a list of shitlists.</p>

            <h3>Feliĉan Zamenhofan Tagon</h3>

            <p>
                Zamenhof Day (also known as Esperanto Book Day) is the birthday of the creator of the constructed
                language Esperanto, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._L._Zamenhof">Ludwik Łazarz Zamenhof</a>.
                It’s widely celebrated as the Day of Esperanto by many Esperantists across the world.
            </p>

            <p>
                I even have a t-shirt for the occasion, and you know I’m serious when I have a t-shirt.
            </p>

            <p>
                <img src="https://martinrue.com/assets/by-post/fzt/cxemizo.png">
            </p>

            <p>
                Zamenhof created Esperanto in 1887. His goal was to create an auxillary language that could be shared by
                everyone equally. A language where everyone is an equal and everyone, regardless of where they were
                born, can communicate and understand each other.
            </p>

            <p>
                I first started learning Esperanto out of sheer curiosity. Almost for the same reason I may have
                otherwise pondered to myself “Hey, how do you insult someone’s mother in Klingon?” – which by the way,
                is to suggest that she has a smooth forehead (Hab SoSlI’ Quch).
            </p>

            <p>
                Warning: Please don’t say this to any Klingons you know, as it’s very insulting, and they’re pretty good
                with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat%27leth">bat’leth</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                To me, Esperanto was much more interesting than other constructed languages. I quickly realised that
                it’s a complete language with a rich vocabulary, a ridiculously simple grammar, and believe it or not,
                lots of fluent speakers across the world (and even a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Esperanto_speakers">few native speakers</a>).
            </p>

            <p>
                After dabbling with the language for a long time, and studying it more deliberately in recent years, I
                have to admit that it has been one of the most enjoyable things I’ve done.
            </p>

            <p>
                Esperanto has some unique attributes which makes it a fun hobby to pursue, with some big upsides if you
                decide to take it further.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here’s why I’m a big fan:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    ⚡ It’s easy. Esperanto is by far the simplest language to learn, requiring a fraction of the time it
                    would take to learn a national language.
                </li>

                <li>
                    🧠 It’s consistent. It has a regular grammar, with rules that are consistently followed. This is one
                    of the reasons it’s easier to learn. It’s like a programming language for your mouth.
                </li>

                <li>
                    🕺 There’s a strong and very supportive community. Perhaps due to how few speakers there are
                    (relatively speaking), Esperantists always have time for each other. This is a huge benefit for me,
                    because it means I can be in almost any country in the world, and I’ll be able to find an Esperanto
                    speaker who’ll be more than happy to grab a coffee and hang out.
                </li>

                <li>
                    🌎 International friends. Through Esperanto, you can make new friends from all over the world. The
                    first unexpected benefit of this for me was that it gave me a window to a much wider perspective on
                    things, particularly world events. I can read news in Esperanto from different countries, and get a
                    sense of what is happening / what people are thinking in the non-English parts of the big rock we
                    live on.
                </li>

                <li>
                    🗣 It’s a gateway language. While Esperanto probably isn’t the best choice for a language that will
                    open doors to higher paid jobs, it does train your brain in a regular and consistent way to learn a
                    new language. It trains you to think about different aspects of language, including aspects of your
                    native language that you don’t start thinking about until you begin learning a second. Many people
                    go from Esperanto to a third language and find the experience easier with their new
                    language-learning-primed brains.
                </li>

                <li>
                    🛫 Travel. Lots of Esperantists will host other Esperantists in their home towns, for free, making
                    traveling the world even more appealing (and possible). The
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasporta_Servo">Pasporta Servo</a> has been going since
                    1966, allowing Esperantists to find hosts to stay with, or host traveling Esperantists themselves.
                    In each different country, you’ll be able to communicate via Esperanto, and have a completely
                    different experience than the typical tourist trails.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                If all that sounds so sweet that you’ve already cancelled your weekend plans, perhaps your next question
                is “How do I learn it?”
            </p>

            <p>
                Well, since I’m here, allow me to give you a few tips:
            </p>

            <p>
                Saluton.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hello.
            </p>

            <p>
                That’ll nicely open up a conversation with any Esperanto speaker, and you’ll hear it quite often.
            </p>

            <p>
                Just like other languages, you’ll probably immediately throw in:
            </p>

            <p>
                Kiel vi fartas?
            </p>

            <p>
                How are you?
            </p>

            <p>
                To your amazement, you did not in fact ask the other person if they broke wind.
            </p>

            <p>
                Given that you both speak Esperanto, naturally you’re both feeling pretty awesome about things,
                warranting the response:
            </p>

            <p>
                Bonege dankon, kaj vi?
            </p>

            <p>
                Great thanks, and you?
            </p>

            <p>
                Maybe you’re a bit tired:
            </p>

            <p>
                Mi estas iomete laca, sed ne malbona.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm a bit tired, but not bad.
            </p>

            <p>
                You’ve just noticed your Esperanto friend is
                <a href="https://i.imgur.com/KykL6rx.gifv">eating her peas one-by-one</a>,
                and want to wrap up the conversation as quickly as possible:
            </p>

            <p>
                Ĝis poste!
            </p>

            <p>
                See you later!
            </p>

            <p>
                Here’s a few cool things to note about this conversation.
            </p>

            <p>
                All letters in Esperanto make consistent sounds, so unlike English (where ‘ough’ has approximately 1
                billion different sounds), you can look at a written word and reliably say it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Also notice how we have <strong>-as</strong> on the end of the word fart<strong>as</strong>? That’s how
                you make a verb (a doing-word) refer to the present tense in Esperanto.
            </p>

            <p>
                And guess what? That’s <strong>always</strong> how you get the present tense version of a verb. I mean,
                how easy is that? Want the past tense instead? No problem, just change the <strong>-as</strong> to
                <strong>-is</strong>. The future? <strong>-os</strong> will be your friend. The best bit is that these
                rules never change – all verbs can be produced this way, with no exceptions.
            </p>

            <p>
                You probably don’t believe me, but it’s true – if having the sort of grammar that brings tears of joy to
                the eyes of its learners was a crime, Esperanto would be doing life in maximum security.
            </p>

            <p>
                But there’s more.
            </p>

            <p>
                Pop-quiz. How do you get the plural of a word in English?
            </p>

            <p>
                Add an ‘s’ to the end, you say? Well sometimes, but it doesn’t always work. I definitely don’t have two
                foots. And while I’ve been told I only have <strong>half</strong> a brain, I figure it’s the stronger of
                the two <strong>halves</strong> I’ve kept.
            </p>

            <p>
                In Esperanto, just add <strong>-j</strong>. You can add it to any singular noun or adjective. That rule
                never changes either.
            </p>

            <p>
                If I have more than one <strong>kato</strong> (cat), I most certainly have <strong>katoj</strong>
                (cats). If I were to drink more than one <strong>biero</strong> (beer), and honestly, I never do, then
                I’d have consumed <strong>bieroj</strong> (beers), and would probably slur my <strong>vortoj</strong>
                (words).
            </p>

            <p>
                In Esperanto, we don’t waste space in our dictionaries with both ‘good’ and ‘bad’, ‘left and ‘right’,
                ‘up’ and ‘down’. We just have one of them, and then use the prefix <strong>mal</strong> to create the
                logical opposite. Now you have fewer words to learn.
            </p>

            <p>
                I can only imagine you’re finding this post <strong>bona</strong> (good), but if you aren’t (and let’s
                face it… you are), you’d be finding it <strong>malbona</strong> (bad).
            </p>

            <p>
                The prefix <strong>mal</strong> can be used to prefix anything, assuming it still makes sense. One could
                say <strong>malsaluton</strong>, which despite stepping all over the toes of <strong>ĝis</strong> (bye),
                would make sense to an Esperanto speaker. It would no doubt also make them think you’re a bit weird, but
                that’s beside the point – perhaps you are.
            </p>

            <p>
                Adverbs, adjectives, participles, and every other grammatical aspect of Esperanto has a similar sense of
                structure and consistency like the examples above, making it much easier to learn.
            </p>

            <p>
                At this point, I’m pretty sure you could already have a …</p></article></div>

December 15, 2020 | https://thegreencodes.com/non-primitive-non-linear-data-structures-trees | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://thegreencodes.com/non-primitive-non-linear-data-structures-trees">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Speaking of Christmas trees, let's shake one-two before the carols -  like our fathers and their fathers before them. Literally.</p>
<p>Now, when it comes to data storage, using linear structures, be it <a target="_blank" href="https://thegreencodes.com/data-structures-the-linear-non-primitives">linked lists and arrays</a> or even <a target="_blank" href="https://thegreencodes.com/data-structures-stacking-and-queueing">stacks and queues</a>, we have accountability over time complexity as the size of our data increases. That is, the larger the data being stored, the more time it takes to extract this data or manipulate it.</p>
<p>'<em>Ohh well great! You've shown me how to store data only to give me the cons afterward?! What on earth!</em>'</p>
<p>Hold on for one moment, will you! That's why this piece is here. <strong>The non-primitive non-linear data structures</strong>.</p>
<p>As with family lines, from grandpa to great grandpa and yourself, so is the same applied to data structures.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608017057888/XWm7wcCVx.png?auto=compress" alt="Trees.png"></p>
<p>A little theory before we get into the why. We'll start off with the parent; the root. 
It's from here that everything emanates. Just like a Linux directory structure. The <code>/</code> directory. </p>
<p>Our tree root has two 'children', <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, defined by engineers as <code>nodes</code>. From here, we see <code>B</code> with its own pair of children, 'C' and 'D' of whom C proceeds to get a single child node 'E'. We might as well call C a parent at this point.</p>
<p>The little lines marking the links between parent and child would be named <code>edges</code>.
Following a specific path to the final child, for instance, following through to <code>E</code> would name this bottom descendant a leaf node or external node. It's the last child in this specific path with no children. The same applies to A and D.</p>
<h4 id="depth-of-nodes">Depth of nodes</h4>
<p>The number of edges from the root to the node. In our case, E would have a depth of 3.</p>
<h4 id="height-of-a-node">Height of a node</h4>
<p>How far is the smallest child from it in this specific path? B, for instance, will have a height of 2. Given there are two edges before we get to the furthest descendant in its path. Depending on how many children it has, how far is the furthest child of a node? How many nodes does this child have?</p>
<h4 id="height-of-tree">Height of Tree</h4>
<p>The height of a tree's root node.</p>
<h4 id="degree-of-node">Degree of Node</h4>
<p> The number of children of a node. Above, C has a degree of one while B has that of two.</p>
<p>A practical train of thought. We have data to be queried from an API REST endpoint. Our system has users, profiles, and articles. Thinking logically, a user profile is a child node of the user's endpoint. We will have to get a user to log in, get the token, and query the profile based on the token. Something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608021263968/inwO5DFit.png?auto=compress" alt="rest-endpoint.png"></p>
<p>So in your thought process, seeing as it is, software development is more of thinking than writing code, it would make sense to create a <code>user model</code> before a <code>profile</code>. Our <code>User</code> model is the parent, the root. </p>
<p>Compare this to having a linear data structure.</p>
<p>We could go on to break trees into more individual types:</p>
<p>a) General Tree</p>
<p>b) Binary Tree</p>
<p>c) Binary Search Tree</p>
<p>d) AVL Tree</p>
<h3 id="binary-tree">Binary Tree</h3>
<p>A tree, as displayed above, in which case parents have at max, two children. Due to this, the children are referred to as the left and right child. Think of how we might have this in decision trees, where we perform an action based on a condition. 
To elaborate further, we have the below groups.</p>
<h4 id="full-binary-tree">Full Binary tree</h4>
<p>Every node of the tree has two or zero children.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608022900340/czulV8J6u.png?auto=compress" alt="full-binary.png"></p>
<h4 id="perfect-binary-tree">Perfect Binary Tree</h4>
<p>The tree internal nodes have two children. All leaves also have the same depth. A perfect uniform.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608023219349/ootMFOgFX.png?auto=compress" alt="perfect-binary-tree.png"></p>
<h4 id="balanced-tree">Balanced Tree</h4>
<p>If the height of the left and right subtree at any node differs at most by 1, then the tree is called a balanced tree. So in the case of the perfect binary, if either of the last child nodes had one more child, one and only one, it would become a balanced tree. It's a strange way of calling something balanced, I know!</p>
<h3 id="general-tree">General Tree</h3>
<p>Consider a binary tree. Any type of binary tree, but without limitations to what number of children a node can have. Do you want 4? Do you want 17? Go ahead and fill your database or whatever it is your structuring.</p>
<h3 id="binary-search-tree">Binary Search Tree</h3>
<p>A different way of looking at Binary search trees if you may. Here, the left nodes are always smaller than their parents in terms of the value they possess. The right nodes, however, are a little cocky, always having more value than their parents or being equal. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608024052809/c5HCm3fgY.png?auto=compress" alt="binary-search-tree.png"></p>
<p>'<em>Well, that's not right. I've never seen this man in my life!</em>'</p>
<p>Used maps/dictionaries before? Yeap. binary search trees you deserter!</p>
<p>Searching for a specific item in an array of 100 or 200 might not be a problem. Increase this to 10 000 or 1 000 000 items, however, no one wants to be the user.</p>
<h3 id="avl-tree">AVL Tree</h3>
<p>Named after Adelson, Velsky, and Landis, this is a self-balancing binary tree in which each node has extra information -  the balance factor-   whose value is either -1, 0, or 1.</p>
<p>You remember <a href="####Height of a node">heights</a>, right? Well, the balance factor comes in as below:</p>
<p><strong>BalanceFactor = height_of_left_subtree - height_of_right_subtree</strong></p>
<p>Whenever a tree is out of balance, AVL trees work around this by rotating nodes. Whether moving the right node to the left or the right, or left-right rotation or perhaps right-left rotation.</p>
<p>What this means is that at one point, the right node which seemed heavy/ larger to the left will become the parent and hence the parent becomes the left child while the left child becomes the new right child and so on. think of it in terms of the hour clock. It will rotate itself in either direction until the tree is balanced. More detail on this can be elaborated on in a later conversation. Keep an eye up!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We've taken a bucket load of information. Trees and searching, children, and siblings. What is all this knowledge without implementation? Fire up that laptop one last time this year and think of how you could have consumed that endpoint differently. Take a sabbatical, if you may, and have the rest you need, then come back and break the time complexity barrier. Write more efficient code, more productive code, and let's make the user experience smoother.</p>

    <p><small>Council adopts resolution on encryption</small></p>


        </div>

    




<p>The Council today adopted a resolution on encryption, highlighting the need for security through encryption and security despite encryption.</p>
<p>In this resolution, the Council underlines its support for the development, implementation and use of strong encryption as a necessary means of protecting fundamental rights and the digital security of citizens, governments, industry and society. At the same time, the Council notes the need to ensure that competent law enforcement and judicial authorities are able to exercise their legal powers, both online and offline, to protect our societies and citizens.</p>
<p>Law enforcement authorities and the judiciary are increasingly dependent on access to electronic evidence to effectively fight terrorism, organised crime, child sexual abuse, and a range of other cybercrime and cyber-enabled crimes. Such access is essential to the success of law enforcement and criminal justice in cyberspace. However, there are instances where encryption renders access to and analysis of evidence extremely challenging or impossible in practice.</p>
<p>The EU is striving to establish an active discussion with the technology industry, and with close involvement from research, academia, industry, civil society and other stakeholders, so as to strike the right balance between ensuring the continued use of strong encryption technology and guaranteeing the powers of law enforcement and the judiciary to operate on the same terms as in the offline world. Potential technical solutions will need to respect privacy and fundamental rights, and preserve the value that technological progress brings to society.</p>

<p>The software has poured into almost all areas of our lives throughout the
years. It remembers phone numbers of our loved ones, it finds the best route to
a well-reviewed restaurant we want to eat in, and many many more things. This
ever-presence of software engineering in our day-to-day things brings all
kinds of questions on what is ethical and what is not.</p>
<p>The topic of ethics is significant for us programmers (developers) who
produce living and breathing pieces of code every day. Those pieces of code can
change and affect other people’s lives. So, is being ethical in your work worth
it? And what to do when presented with questionable requirements from your
superiors?</p>
<p>These are all hard questions and topics, but let’s try to break them together.</p>
<h2 id="to-bully-or-to-be-bullied"><a href="#to-bully-or-to-be-bullied" aria-label="to bully or to be bullied permalink"></a>To Bully, or To Be Bullied</h2>
<p>I recently came about a tweet where a company was being called out for planning
to build features that would do surveillance on their users. Here’s the <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1336266946044686337">tweet</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The surveillance regime marches on. This is Clockify promising a road map of ever-more oppressive and dehumanizing tracking of employees. If we're just being HONEST here, I'd like to see this blown into a million bits. Source code encrypted and the key lost. Just awful. <a href="https://t.co/OfnjKn6dDp">https://t.co/OfnjKn6dDp</a></p>— DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1336266946044686337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>A company named Clockify, which provides time-tracking features to their users,
exposed a road-map where they will do screenshots and GPS tracking of their
users. Of course, somebody took the picture in the tweet out of context. The
idea was to provide these features to only some portion of their users who
would pay for them. I am not saying it to justify the features they
are adding, just trying to put more context into the conversation.</p>
<p>Of course, the idea of watching over someone while they work is appalling to me,
and I would never work or run a company that does this. What’s more
intriguing to me is the dilemma of what do you do when you work for such a company. We will
always have some persona on social media that will bash the shit out
of ideas like user surveillance, but what can a ground-level developer like
you and me do in this situation?</p>

<p>Let’s say you work in that company, and someone asked you to build a feature that
tracks what users do on their computers. Would you stand up and say a hard ‘no’
to the management? Or, would you nod your head and leave a 👍 reaction.
Answering this question is hard. But to make it a bit easier, I would like to
remind you that even as an engineer, you can be held accountable, even though
you are not the ‘mastermind’ behind all of it.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to scare you or anything, but did you know that Volkswagen’s
engineer got sentenced to more than three years in prison for being involved in a
scheme that allowed VW to sell diesel cars that generated more pollution than
it was allowed? You can read all about it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-emissions-sentencing/vw-engineer-sentenced-to-40-month-prison-term-in-diesel-case-idUSKCN1B51YP">here</a>.
You decide if it was worth it for that guy.</p>
<h2 id="taking-the-oath"><a href="#taking-the-oath" aria-label="taking the oath permalink"></a>Taking the oath</h2>
<p>No matter what job you do as a developer. You had to start somewhere. Some
folks took the university route. Some did the online courses at
home and honed their craft. But no matter what you did, rarely anyone had a
class or a course to them a thing or two about ethics.</p>
<p>In other professions, such as have their documents with core values and
standards. The most famous one is, of course, the Hippocratic oath medical
doctors need to take. Doctors promise to care responsibly for their patients
and learn ethics as part of their education. It is crucial for doctor’s
patients to feel confident that the doctor has their best interest at heart.</p>
<p>We should have something similar in our line of work but applied
more often. There are a couple of examples where people put together documents
that describe what ethics for software engineers is. For example, the world’s
largest educational and scientific computing society - ACM - has a
<a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.
Check it out, it is an interesting read.</p>
<p>I am not saying that enforcing all computing professionals to take some oath
will drop the surveillance or other unethical software to drop to
zero. People will try to go out of the way whatever we do. What we need to do
instead is to teach about ethics in computer science <strong>more</strong> since our actions
can impact the world more than ever.</p>
<h2 id="field-studies"><a href="#field-studies" aria-label="field studies permalink"></a>Field studies</h2>
<p>An interesting thing I found is that StackOverflow asked a couple of questions
about ethics in 2018 (now two years ago). It turns out that most of the developers
(58.5% to be precise) back then said that they would refuse to write code for
an unethical purpose. Also, a huge portion (almost 80%) said that developers have an
obligation to consider the ethical implications of their code, which is relieving.</p>
<p>Alongside these numbers of ethics awareness, there were a lot of ethical grays.
Devs are not entirely sure who would they report ethical problems. Furthermore,
developers think differently about who is ultimately responsible
for the unethical code. Right there, in those two spots, I see a lot of room for
improvement. There is potential to educate companies and teams and have go-to
persons to report unethical claims in establishments.</p>
<p>I wonder how the survey would perform if the same questions get asked this year. If
you’re interested in the survey, you can check it out
<a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#ethics">on StackOverflow here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="so-is-it-worth-it"><a href="#so-is-it-worth-it" aria-label="so is it worth it permalink"></a>So, is it worth it?</h2>
<p>Well, it depends on who you ask. If you are a person responsible for a company’s income,
your best interest is to see trends on charts go in the upwards
direction. How you do it, it might now be the most ethical way, but you are
still crushing it. Or are you?</p>

    </span></p>
<p>I am going back to the example of the Clockify (or Hubstaff, or any other time-tracking)
product. The new features that go over the ethics will probably be the most
expensive ones, and could provide more profit for the company. Is that a good
thing? Not always, I believe. If you’re chasing to increase those fancy
acronyms (ARR and MRR) and do not care about the ethics (and the world) - then
I think it is not a good thing.</p>
<p>Yes, the income will come quicker, but the broader impact on the world can be
detrimental. Imagine if all the time-tracking companies will slowly move to
this approach and that surveillance will become the norm in these apps.</p>
<p>So, in the end, no, I <strong>do think being ethical in your work is worth it</strong>. Maybe
not in a quantifiable way or in a way where you can plot a chart and show it to
your manager. Definitely, the actions you decide to take or not to take can
impact those around you. I feel that the fact that we can influence other
people’s lives is something we, as programmers, often overlook. And we shouldn’t
do that, because what’s most important to remember is that we are all in this
together.</p>
<h2 id="action-points"><a href="#action-points" aria-label="action points permalink"></a>Action points</h2>
<p>Where to go now? I recommend reading or going through a couple of resources here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_ethics">Programming ethics on Wikipedia</a> - provides a good summary</li>
<li><a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics">ACM Code of Ethics</a> - in-depth example of an ethics code</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10284614-the-clean-coder">The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers</a> - great book overall</li>
<li><a href="https://simpleprogrammer.com/ethical-programming-professional/">What It Takes To Be an Ethical Programming Professional</a> - an insightful blog post</li>
<li>If going through an online course is your thing, maybe try one of those</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, being ethical won’t be easy, and it won’t look great at times. The
most critical takeaway from this post is to spend time to set up your ethical
boundaries. From then on, it is easier to have conversations and ask questions
like - “is this in the best interest of our users?” and “how does this affect
our organization’s reputation?“.</p>
<p>I hope this post brought some insight or, at least, reminded you that something
like ethics still exists in our profession. If you like topics like these,

December 15, 2020 | https://betterdev.blog/minimal-safe-bash-script-template/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://betterdev.blog/minimal-safe-bash-script-template/">archive.org</a>

<p>Bash scripts. Almost anyone needs to write one sooner or later. Almost no one says “yeah, I love writing them”. And that’s why almost everyone is putting low attention while writing them.</p>



<p>I won’t try to make you a Bash expert (since I’m not a one either), but I will show you a minimal template that will make your scripts safer. You don’t need to thank me, your future self will thank you.</p>



<h2><span id="why_scripting_in_bash"></span>Why scripting in Bash?<span></span></h2>



<p>The best summary of Bash scripting appeared recently on my Twitter feed:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The opposite of "it's like riding a bike" is "it's like programming in bash".</p><p>A phrase which means that no matter how many times you do something, you will have to re-learn it every single time.</p></div>— Jake Wharton (@JakeWharton) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeWharton/status/1334177665356587008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>But Bash has something in common with another widely beloved language. Just like JavaScript, it won’t go away easily. While we can hope that Bash won’t become the main language for literally everything, it’s always somewhere near.</p>



<p>Bash <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-Bash-considered-the-lingua-franca-of-shells/answer/Paul-Reiber">inherited the shell throne</a> and can be found on almost every Linux, including Docker images. And this is the environment in which most of the backend runs. So if you need to script the server application startup, a CI/CD step, or integration test run, Bash is there for you.</p>



<p>To glue few commands together, pass output from one to another, and just start some executable, Bash is the easiest and most native solution. While it makes perfect sense to write bigger, more complicated scripts in other languages, you can’t expect to have Python, Ruby, fish, or whatever another interpreter you believe is the best, available everywhere. And you probably should think twice and then once more before adding it to some prod server, Docker image, or CI environment.</p>



<p>Yet Bash is far from perfect. The syntax is a nightmare. Error handling is difficult. There are landmines everywhere. And we have to deal with it.</p>



<h2><span id="bash_script_template"></span>Bash script template<span></span></h2>



<p>Without further ado, here it is.</p>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -Eeuo pipefail
trap cleanup SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT

script_dir=$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" &amp;&gt;/dev/null &amp;&amp; pwd -P)

  cat &lt;&lt;EOF

-h, --help      Print this help and exit
-v, --verbose   Print script debug info
-f, --flag      Some flag description
-p, --param     Some param description
EOF
  exit
}

cleanup() {
  trap - SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT
  # script cleanup here
}

setup_colors() {
  if [[ -t 2 ]] &amp;&amp; [[ -z "${NO_COLOR-}" ]] &amp;&amp; [[ "${TERM-}" != "dumb" ]]; then
    NOFORMAT='\033[0m' RED='\033[0;31m' GREEN='\033[0;32m' ORANGE='\033[0;33m' BLUE='\033[0;34m' PURPLE='\033[0;35m' CYAN='\033[0;36m' YELLOW='\033[1;33m'

}

  echo &gt;&amp;2 -e "${1-}"
}

die() {

  msg "$msg"
  exit "$code"
}

parse_params() {
  # default values of variables set from params
  flag=0
  param=''

  while :; do
    case "${1-}" in
    -h | --help) usage ;;
    -v | --verbose) set -x ;;
    --no-color) NO_COLOR=1 ;;
    -f | --flag) flag=1 ;; # example flag

      param="${2-}"
      shift
      ;;
    -?*) die "Unknown option: $1" ;;
    *) break ;;
    esac
    shift
  done

  args=("$@")

  # check required params and arguments
  [[ -z "${param-}" ]] &amp;&amp; die "Missing required parameter: param"
  [[ ${#args[@]} -eq 0 ]] &amp;&amp; die "Missing script arguments"

  return 0
}

parse_params "$@"
setup_colors

# script logic here

msg "${RED}Read parameters:${NOFORMAT}"
msg "- flag: ${flag}"
msg "- param: ${param}"
msg "- arguments: ${args[*]-}"</code></pre>



<p>The idea was to not make it too long. I don’t want to scroll 500 lines to the script logic. At the same time, I want some strong foundations for any script. But Bash is not making this easy, lacking any form of dependencies management.</p>



<p>One solution would be to have a separate script with all the boilerplate and utility functions and execute it at the beginning. The downside would be to have to always attach this second file everywhere, losing the “simple Bash script” idea along the way. So I decided to put in the template only what I consider to be a minimum to keep it possible short.</p>



<p>Now let’s look at it in more detail.</p>



<h3><span id="choose_bash"></span>Choose Bash<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash</code></pre>



<p>Script traditionally starts with a shebang. For the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21612980/why-is-usr-bin-env-bash-superior-to-bin-bash">best compatibility</a>, it references <code>/usr/bin/env</code>, not the <code>/bin/bash</code> directly. Although, if you read comments in the linked StackOverflow question, even this can fail sometimes.</p>



<h3><span id="fail_fast"></span>Fail fast<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>set -Eeuo pipefail</code></pre>



<p>The <code>set</code> command changes script execution options. For example, <strong>normally Bash does not care if some command failed</strong>, returning a non-zero exit status code. It just happily jumps to the next one. Now consider this little script:</p>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash
cp important_file ./backups/
rm important_file</code></pre>



<p>What will happen, if the <code>backups</code> directory does not exist? Exactly, you will get an error message in the console, but before you will be able to react, the file will be already removed by the second command.</p>



<p>For details on what options exactly <code>set -Eeuo pipefail</code> changes and how they will protect you, I refer you to the <a href="https://vaneyckt.io/posts/safer_bash_scripts_with_set_euxo_pipefail/">article I have in my bookmarks for a few years now</a>.</p>



<p>Although you should know that there are some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/g1vsxk/the_first_two_statements_of_your_bash_script/fniifmk?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">arguments against setting those options</a>.</p>



<h3><span id="get_the_location"></span>Get the location<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>script_dir=$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" &amp;&gt;/dev/null &amp;&amp; pwd -P)</code></pre>



<p>This line <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/246128/2512304">does its best</a> to define the script’s location directory<s>, and then we <code>cd</code> to it. Why?</s></p>



<p>Often our scripts are operating on paths relative to the script location, copying files and executing commands, assuming the script directory is also a working directory. And it is, as long as we execute the script from its directory.</p>



<p>But if, let’s say, our CI config executes script like this:</p>



<pre><code>/opt/ci/project/script.sh</code></pre>



<p>then our script is operating not in project dir, but some completely different workdir of our CI tool. We can fix it, by going to the directory before executing the script:</p>



<pre><code>cd /opt/ci/project &amp;&amp; ./script.sh</code></pre>



<p>But it’s much nicer to solve this on the script side. So, if the script reads some file or executes another program from the same directory, call it like this:</p>



<pre><code>cat "$script_dir/my_file"</code></pre>



<p>At the same time, the script does not change the workdir location. If the script is executed from some other directory and the user provides a relative path to some file, we will still be able to read it.</p>



<h3><span id="try_to_clean_up"></span>Try to clean up<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>trap cleanup SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT

cleanup() {
  trap - SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT
  # script cleanup here
}</code></pre>



<p>Think about the <code>trap</code> like of a <code>finally</code> block for the script. At the end of the script – normal, caused by an error or an external signal – the <code>cleanup()</code> function will be executed. This is a place where you can, for example, try to remove all temporary files created by the script.</p>



<p>Just remember that the <code>cleanup()</code> can be called not only at the end but as well having the script done any part of the work. Not necessarily all the resources you try to cleanup will exist.</p>



<h3><span id="display_helpful_help"></span>Display helpful help<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>usage() {
  cat &lt;&lt;EOF
Usage: $(basename "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}") [-h] [-v] [-f] -p param_value arg1 [arg2...]

Script description here.

...
EOF
  exit
}</code></pre>



<p>Having the <code>usage()</code> relatively close to the top of the script, it will act in two ways:</p>



<ul><li>to <strong>display help</strong> for someone who does not know all the options and does not want to go over the whole script to discover them,</li><li>as a <strong>minimal documentation</strong> when someone modifies the script (for example you, 2 weeks later, not even remembering writing it in the first place).</li></ul>



<p>I don’t argue to document every function here. But a short, nice script usage message is a required minimum.</p>



<h3><span id="print_nice_messages"></span>Print nice messages<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>setup_colors() {
  if [[ -t 2 ]] &amp;&amp; [[ -z "${NO_COLOR-}" ]] &amp;&amp; [[ "${TERM-}" != "dumb" ]]; then

  echo &gt;&amp;2 -e "${1-}"
}</code></pre>



<p>Firstly, remove the <code>setup_colors()</code> function if you don’t want to use colors in text anyway. I keep it because I know I would use colors more often if I wouldn’t have to google codes for them every time.</p>



<p>Secondly, those <strong>colors are meant to be used with the <code>msg()</code> function only</strong>, not with the <code>echo</code> command.</p>



<p>The <strong><code>msg()</code> function is meant to be used to print everything that is not a script output</strong>. This includes all logs and messages, not only the errors. Citing the great <a href="https://medium.com/@jdxcode/12-factor-cli-apps-dd3c227a0e46">12 Factor CLI Apps</a> article:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>In short: stdout is for output, stderr is for messaging.</strong></p><cite><a href="https://jdxcode.com/">Jeff Dickey</a>, who <a href="https://github.com/oclif/oclif/graphs/contributors">knows a little</a> about <a href="https://github.com/heroku/cli/graphs/contributors">building CLI apps</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>That’s why in most cases you shouldn’t use colors for <code>stdout</code> anyway.</p>



<p>Messages printed with <code>msg()</code> are sent to <code>stderr</code> stream and support special sequences, like colors. And colors are disabled anyway if the <code>stderr</code> output is not an interactive terminal or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://no-color.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the standard parameters</a>&nbsp;is passed.</p>



<p>Usage:</p>



<pre><code>msg "This is a ${RED}very important${NOFORMAT} message, but not a script output value!"</code></pre>



<p>To check how it behaves when the <code>stderr</code> is not an interactive terminal, add a line like above to the script. Then execute it redirecting <code>stderr</code> to <code>stdout</code> and piping it to <code>cat</code>. Pipe operation makes the output no longer being sent directly to the terminal, but to the next command, so the colors should be disabled now.</p>



<pre><code>$ ./test.sh 2&gt;&amp;1 | cat
This is a very important message, but not a script output value!</code></pre>



<h3><span id="parse_any_parameters"></span>Parse any parameters<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>parse_params() {
  # default values of variables set from params
  flag=0
  param=''

  while :; do
    case "${1-}" in
    -h | --help) usage ;;
    -v | --verbose) set -x ;;
    --no-color) NO_COLOR=1 ;;
    -f | --flag) flag=1 ;; # example flag
    -p | --param) # …</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://mypy-lang.org/" rel="noopener">Mypy</a> is an optional static type checker for Python. It's been around since 2012 and is gaining traction even since. One of the main benefits of using a type checker is getting errors at "compile time" rather than at run time.</p>
<p>Exhaustiveness checking is a common feature of type checkers, and a very useful one! In this article I'm going to show you <strong>how you can get mypy to perform exhaustiveness checking!</strong></p>

<hr>
<h2 id="exhaustiveness-checking"><a href="#exhaustiveness-checking">Exhaustiveness Checking</a></h2>
<p>Say you have a system to manage orders. To represent the status of an order, you have the following enum:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>enum</span>

<span>class</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>(</span><span>enum</span><span>.</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>Ready</span> <span>=</span> <span>'ready'</span>
    <span>Shipped</span> <span>=</span> <span>'shipped'</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You also have the following code to process an <code>Order</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>handle_order</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>:</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Ready</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'ship order'</span><span>)</span>

    <span>elif</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Shipped</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'charge order'</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>When the order is ready, you ship it; and when it's shipped, you charge it.</p>
<p>A few months go by and your system becomes big. So big in fact, that you can no longer ship orders immediately, and you add a new status:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>enum</span>

<span>class</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>(</span><span>enum</span><span>.</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>Ready</span> <span>=</span> <span>'ready'</span>
<span>    <span>Scheduled</span> <span>=</span> <span>'scheduled'</span>
</span>    <span>Shipped</span> <span>=</span> <span>'shipped'</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Before you push this change to production, you run a quick check with mypy to make sure everything is OK:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
Success: no issues found in <span>1</span> <span>source</span> file
</pre></div>


<p>Mypy does not see anything wrong in this code, Do you? The problem is that <strong>you forgot to handle the new status in your function</strong>.</p>
<p>One way to make sure you always handle all possible order statuses is to add an assert, or throw an exception:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>handle_order</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>:</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Ready</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'ship order'</span><span>)</span>

    <span>elif</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Shipped</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'charge order'</span><span>)</span>

<span>    <span>assert</span> <span>False</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>'Unhandled status "{status}"'</span>
</span></pre></div>


<p>Now, when you execute the function with the new status <code>OrderStatus.Scheduled</code>, you will get a runtime error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>handle_order</span><span>(</span><span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Scheduled</span><span>)</span>
<span>AssertionError</span><span>:</span> <span>Unhandled</span> <span>status</span> <span>"OrderStatus.Scheduled"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Another way to with deal with cases like this is to go over your test suite and add scenarios in all the places that use order status. But... if you forgot to change the function when you added the status, what are the chances you'll remember to update the tests? That's not a good solution...</p>
<p><strong>Exhaustiveness Checking in Mypy</strong></p>
<p>What if mypy could warn you at "compile time" about such cases? Well... it can, using this little magic function:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>NoReturn</span>
<span>import</span> <span>enum</span>

<span>def</span> <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>NoReturn</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>NoReturn</span><span>:</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>False</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>'Unhandled value: {value} ({type(value).__name__})'</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Before you dig into the implementation, try to use it to see how it works. In the function above, place <code>assert_never</code> after you handled all the possible order statuses, where you previously used <code>assert</code> or raises an exception:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>handle_order</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>:</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Ready</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'ship order'</span><span>)</span>

    <span>elif</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Shipped</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'charge order'</span><span>)</span>

<span>    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>        <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>)</span>
</span></pre></div>


<p>Now, check the code with Mypy:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
error: Argument <span>1</span> to <span>"assert_never"</span> has incompatible <span>type</span> <span>"Literal[OrderStatus.Scheduled]"</span><span>;</span>
expected <span>"NoReturn"</span>
Found <span>1</span> error in <span>1</span> file <span>(</span>checked <span>1</span> <span>source</span> file<span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Amazing! <strong>Mypy warns you about a status you forgot to handle!</strong> The message also includes the value, <code>OrderStatus.Scheduled</code>. If you use a modern editor such as VSCode you can get these warnings immediately as you type:</p>
<figure><img alt="mypy Error in VSCode" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/00-python-mypy-exhaustive-checking.png"><figcaption>mypy Error in VSCode</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can now go ahead and fix your function to handle the missing status:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>handle_order</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>:</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Pending</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'schedule order'</span><span>)</span>

<span>    <span>elif</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Scheduled</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'ship order'</span><span>)</span>
</span>
    <span>elif</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Shipped</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'charge order'</span><span>)</span>

    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Check with mypy again:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
Success: no issues found in <span>1</span> <span>source</span> file
</pre></div>


<p>Great! You can now rest assure you handled all order statuses. The best part is that you did that with <strong>no unit tests</strong>, and there were <strong>no runtime errors</strong>. If you include mypy in your CI, the <strong>bad code will never make it into production</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="enumeration-types"><a href="#enumeration-types">Enumeration types</a></h2>
<p>In the previous section you used mypy to perform exhaustiveness check on an <code>Enum</code>. You can use mypy, and <code>assert_never</code> to perform exhaustiveness check on other enumeration types as well.</p>
<p><strong>Exhaustiveness Checking of a Union</strong></p>
<p>A <code>Union</code> type represents several possible types. For example, a function that casts an argument to <code>float</code> can look like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Union</span>
</span>
<span><span>def</span> <span>get_float</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>:</span> <span>Union</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>float</span><span>:</span>
</span>    <span>if</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>float</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span>

    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Check the function with mypy:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
error: Argument <span>1</span> to <span>"assert_never"</span> has incompatible <span>type</span> <span>"float"</span><span>;</span> expected <span>"NoReturn"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Whoops... you forgot to handle the <code>float</code> type in the code:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Union</span>

<span>def</span> <span>get_float</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>:</span> <span>Union</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>float</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>float</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span>

<span>    <span>elif</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span><span>):</span>

<p>Great! mypy is happy...</p>
<p><strong>Exhaustiveness Checking of a Literal</strong></p>
<p>Another useful type is <code>Literal</code>. It is included in the built-in <code>typing</code> module since Python3.8, and prior to that it is part of the complementary <a href="https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/" rel="noopener"><code>typing_extensions</code> package</a>.</p>
<p>A <code>Literal</code> is used to type primitive values such as strings and numbers. <code>Literal</code> is also an enumeration type, so you can use exhaustiveness checking on it as well:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>typing_extensions</span> <span>import</span> <span>Literal</span>

<span>Color</span> <span>=</span> <span>Literal</span><span>[</span><span>'R'</span><span>,</span> <span>'G'</span><span>,</span> <span>'B'</span><span>]</span>

<span>def</span> <span>get_color_name</span><span>(</span><span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>Color</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>color</span> <span>==</span> <span>'R'</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>'Red'</span>
    <span>elif</span> <span>color</span> <span>==</span> <span>'G'</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>'Green'</span>
    <span># elif color == 'B':</span>
    <span>#     return 'Blue'</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>color</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Checking the code without the commented part will produce the following error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
error: Argument <span>1</span> to <span>"assert_never"</span> has incompatible <span>type</span> <span>"Literal['B']"</span><span>;</span> expected <span>"NoReturn"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Very handy indeed!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="type-narrowing-in-mypy"><a href="#type-narrowing-in-mypy">Type Narrowing in Mypy</a></h2>
<p>Now that you've seen what <code>assert_never</code> can do, you can try and understand how it works. <code>assert_never</code> works alongside <strong>"type narrowing"</strong>, which is a mypy feature where the type of a variable is narrowed based on the control flow of the program. In other words, mypy is gradually eliminating possible types for a variable.</p>
<p>First, it's important to understand how various things translate to a <code>Union</code> type in mypy:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>]</span>
<span># Equivalent to Union[int, None]</span>

<span>Literal</span><span>[</span><span>'string'</span><span>,</span> <span>42</span><span>,</span> <span>True</span><span>]</span>
<span># Equivalent to Union[Literal['string'], Literal[42], Literal[True]]</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Suit</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>Clubs</span> <span>=</span> <span>"♣"</span>
    <span>Diamonds</span> <span>=</span> <span>"♦"</span>
    <span>Hearts</span> <span>=</span> <span>"♥"</span>
    <span>Spades</span> <span>=</span> <span>"♠"</span>

<span>Suit</span>
<span># ~Equivalent to Union[</span>
<span>#   Literal[Suit.Clubs],</span>
<span>#   Literal[Suit.Diamonds],</span>
<span>#   Literal[Suit.Hearts],</span>
<span>#   Literal[Suit.Spades]</span>
<span># ]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To display the type of an expression, mypy provides a useful utility called <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common_issues.html#reveal-type" rel="noopener"><code>reveal_type</code></a>. Using <code>reveal_type</code> you can ask mypy to show you the inferred type for a variable at the point it's called:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>describe_suit</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Suit</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
<span>    <span># Revealed type is Union[Suit, None]</span>
</span>    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In the function above, the reveled type of <code>suit</code> is <code>Union[Suit, None]</code>, which is the type of the argument <code>suit</code>.</p>
<p>At this point you haven't done anything in the function, so mypy is unable to narrow down the type. Next, add some logic and see how mypy narrows down the type of the variable <code>suit</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>describe_suit</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Suit</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
<span>    <span>assert</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>None</span>
</span><span>    <span># Revealed type is Suit</span>
</span>    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>After eliminating the option of suit being <code>None</code>, the revealed type is <code>Suit</code>. Mypy used your program's logic to narrow the type of the variable.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, the type <code>Suit</code> is equivalent to the type <code>Union[Literal[Suit.Clubs], Literal[Suit.Diamonds], Literal[Suit.Hearts], Literal[Suit.Spades]]</code>, so next, try to narrow down the type even more:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>describe_suit</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Suit</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>None</span>

<span>    <span>if</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Clubs</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>        <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Clubs]</span>
</span>        <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>"Clubs"</span>

<span>    <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Diamonds, Suit.Hearts, Suit.Spades]</span>
</span>    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>After checking if <code>suit</code> is <code>Suit.Clubs</code>, mypy is able to narrow down the type to <code>Suit.Clubs</code>. Mypy is also smart enough to understand that if the condition does not hold, the variable <em>is definitely not</em> <code>Clubs</code>, and narrows down the type to <code>Diamonds</code>, <code>Hearts</code> or <code>Spades</code>.</p>
<p>Mypy can also use other conditional statements to further narrow the type, for example:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>describe_suit</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Suit</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>None</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Clubs</span><span>:</span>
        <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Clubs]</span>
        <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>"Clubs"</span>

    <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Diamonds, Suit.Hearts, Suit.Spades]</span>
    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>

<span>    <span># `and`, `or` and `not` also work.</span>
</span><span>    <span>if</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Diamonds</span> <span>or</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Spades</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>        <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Diamonds, Suit.Spades]</span>
</span>        <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>"Diamonds or Spades"</span>

<span>    <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Hearts]</span>
</span><span>    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
</span></pre></div>


<p>By the end of the function, mypy narrowed down the type of <code>suit</code> to <code>Suit.Hearts</code>. If, for example, you add a condition that imply a different type for <code>suit</code>, mypy will issue an error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>describe_suit</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Suit</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>None</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Clubs</span><span>:</span>
        <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Clubs]</span>
        <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>"Clubs"</span>

    <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Diamonds, Suit.Hearts, Suit.Spades]</span>
    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>

    <span># `and`, `or` and `not` also work.</span>

<p>Chuken, a Japanese Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/chukenDr">influencer</a> with over 12,000 followers, promises to teach his fans how to escape poverty — not by learning personal finance hacks or leaning on welfare programs, but by using loyalty points.</p>



<p>Chuken, which means “loyal dog,” calls himself one of Japan’s top-tier point stars, someone well-versed in the complicated art of “point alchemy.” The loyalty rewards he’s accumulated have helped him pay for everything from utility bills and vacations to the occasional trip to the salon. “I’m one of probably up to 100 people in Japan who earn more than 1 million yen [nearly $10,000] a year from points,” he told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>Despite being the birthplace of payment technology like the QR code, Japan is still <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fdbdb92c-a6ea-11e9-984c-fac8325aaa04">stubbornly addicted</a> to using cash: Around <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-economy-boj/nearly-20-of-japan-households-using-e-money-but-cash-still-king-idUSKBN1XS0Q1">80% of people in the country</a> say they choose it over debit cards or payment apps for small purchases. The generous rewards programs that Chuken promotes are a way for digital payment companies to encourage consumer adoption. But the incentives have also given rise to an enthusiastic <em>poikatsu</em>, or “point activities,” subculture that wants to max out as much as possible.</p>



<p>“Considering how cash-dependent Japan is, for mobile payments to take off, there needs to be a change in consumer behavior,” said Celeste Goh, a financial technology analyst at the market intelligence firm S&amp;P Global. That’s where loyalty points enter the picture.</p>



<p>A doctor by day, Chuken, who asked to be identified only by his Twitter alias for privacy reasons, first became interested in rewards programs after experiencing his own financial struggles. He’s one of thousands of physicians at university hospitals in Japan who have gone <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/backstories/606/">regularly unpaid</a>, even during the Covid-19 pandemic. At first, Twitter was where he swapped tips with other poikatsu enthusiasts, but the hobby soon evolved into a full-fledged lifestyle.</p>



<p>Chuken is just one of many poikatsu personalities that have emerged on Japanese social media in recent years. The biggest stars produce content a few times a week, and also earn additional income from sponsored posts and YouTube advertisements.</p>



<div><p>On Instagram there’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jojo_secco_point/">Setsuko Kikuhara</a>, or Sekko, who describes herself as a “poikatsu-obsessed woman.” The single mother of a 5-year-old, Sekko caters her content primarily toward other parents. One of her popular hacks is teaching followers how to nab year-long passes to Hong Kong Disneyland. Her extreme point collection even landed her on a popular Japanese <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwueZH3NcnU">talk show</a>.</p><p>One of the most successful poikatsu influencers is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ryogakucho/">Ryogakucho</a>, a YouTube creator with more than 600,000 followers who posts step-by-step guides to point hacking. He regularly preaches the gospel of R-Points, a program run by e-commerce giant Rakuten, which rewards consumers for purchases made on its platform. A cartoon lion cheers on subscribers in every video.</p></div>

<div><p>Two years ago, a Japanese think tank <a href="https://www.nira.or.jp/pdf/cashless.pdf#page=15">surveyed 3,000 people in the country, the vast majority of whom said they used rewards points programs at least sometimes</a>. 37% said a major reason they did so was because it was fun. “It’s just like a math problem, game, or sport, but you’re spotting the loopholes of service providers,” said Chuken. “Poikatsu is a hobby that earns you money, rather than loses you money. The better you get, the more it benefits your life.”</p><p>The popularity of poikatsu is in part a result of Japanese consumers’ <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-economy-cashless-idUSKBN1XF0BT">notorious</a> resistance to cashless technology. Even as neighboring countries like South Korea and China quickly adopted digital payments, Japan has clung to physical currency, said Arnie Cho, a fintech analyst at the research firm GlobalData. In early 2020, upwards of <a href="https://daxueconsulting.com/payment-methods-in-china/">700 million consumers</a> were using mobile payments in China, often relying on WeChat Pay and Alipay’s QR code systems. In Japan, that <a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/news/fnn20191214001/the-little-known-story-of-the-birth-of-the-qr-code.html">homegrown technology</a> has rarely been used in fintech, and Chinese tourists have actually <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/smartphone-wielding-chinese-tourists-challenge-cashs-reign-11551609002">helped foster</a> its adoption in the country.</p></div>



<p>International commentators often <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/japan-holdout-asia-cash-free-future/">recycle cultural generalizations </a>to explain Japan’s devotion to cash, but some of the real reasons for the phenomenon may be purely pragmatic. A highly developed banking infrastructure in the country keeps ATMs close, whereas many markets in Southeast Asia are turning to mobile payments to serve the unbanked, said Cho. <a href="https://www.osac.gov/Content/Report/d3d72e3f-6cd9-4fef-9f64-15f4aea79d98#:~:text=There%20is%20minimal%20risk%20from,three%20robberies%20per%20100%2C000%20individuals">Low petty-crime rates</a> also allow the average consumer to feel comfortable carrying a wallet full of cash. Fintech services, meanwhile, <em>have</em> needed to combat problems with fraud. In 2019, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/7-eleven-japan-7pay-hackers-passwords-2019-7">over $500,000 was stolen</a> from 7pay, 7-Eleven Japan’s debut in the mobile payment space. Almost three months after it launched, the company shuttered the program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rewards programs can be expensive for payment apps, but they’re also a reliable way to convince reluctant consumers to give their services a chance. The social media giant Line has relied heavily on point schemes over the past few years, after struggling to get the majority of Japan’s population who already use its messaging platform onto its digital wallet, Line Pay. “Point rewards are an easy-to-understand way to incentivize users,” said Line Pay spokesperson Mayu Kamioka.</p>



<div><p>Line introduced aggressive rewards campaigns in 2018 and 2019 for Line Pay, shortly after the Japanese government set a goal to increase digital payments to <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/12/03/reference/japan-grudgingly-heads-toward-cashless-society/">40% of all transactions by 2027</a> (it later <a href="https://www.meti.go.jp/english/press/2018/0703_001.html">updated</a> the target to 2025). The strategy included the <a href="https://linecorp.com/ja/pr/news/ja/2020/3151">Line Point Club</a>, a tiered system that rewards users based on the number of purchases they make with Line Pay over a six-month span. The company has also used sporadic <a href="https://linecorp.com/ja/pr/news/ja/2019/2672">“Pay-Toku” campaigns</a>, flash deals that give rebates of up to 20% for Line Pay purchases.</p><p>Line said the incentives are working. In a <a href="https://www.linebiz.com/jp/column/research/20200219/">survey</a> the company’s research arm conducted in February, around 38% of smartphone owners said they used a mobile device to make a payment in brick-and-mortar shops in the past 12 months, an increase from 13% from the year before.</p></div>



<p>Line Pay is competing with over a dozen other payment apps in Japan, including PayPay, a service jointly operated by SoftBank and Yahoo! Japan. PayPay said it <a href="https://about.paypay.ne.jp/pr/20201021/01/">doubled its registered users</a> from 10 million to 20 million in three months last year, as it was relying on short-term cash-back <a href="https://image.paypay.ne.jp/pdf/pr20190204_en.pdf">programs</a>, which cost the company around $94 million (10 billion yen) each to run. As <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/08/03/business/corporate-business/yahoo-japan-line-to-postpone-merger-pandemic/">Line and Yahoo! Japan consider a merger next spring</a>, these competing promotions may end up benefiting both companies.</p>

<p>Japanese media outlets have dubbed ongoing fights between payment apps as the “Cashless Sengoku Period,” a nod to Japan’s warring feudal era dating back to the 1400s. Some influencers take it upon themselves to chart the competing campaigns, like Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/haiji_doctor">Haiji Hakase</a>, who is known for his rewards chart featuring color-coded breakdowns of the 12 major payment services and what they’ll be offering over the next few days. “The best deals have changed so rapidly as poikatsu booms. It’s fun to find the best solutions amid the moving targets,” he said.</p>



<p>Yuzuhiko, a 31-year-old office worker in the southwestern city of Fukuoka, who asked to use only his first name, posts poikatsu vlogs on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgIUiYo9N8nmubnLNV6DBzA/">YouTube channel</a> three times a week. In his videos, he explains the latest digital payment trends while speaking through a 3D-animated avatar of a brown tabby cat in a samurai helmet. “I am the only ‘cashless VTuber,’” he said, referring to “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20181002-the-virtual-vloggers-taking-over-youtube">virtual YouTubers</a>” who use computer-generated avatars, a popular genre in Japan.</p>



<p>Yuzuhiko said he’s noticed a big bump in video views this year. In October 2019, <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/09/01/business/tax-rebate-small-retailers-cashless-payments/">a government rebate program</a> began awarding 5% back on some cashless payments, in an effort to boost adoption before the since-postponed 2020 Olympics. The increased popularity may also be due to Covid-19. “Because the pandemic brought financial difficulties to some households, now they might care more about making the most of the available point services,” Yuzuhiko said.</p>



<p>It’s not clear how long the boon in poikatsu content will last. The incentives offered by companies like Line and PayPay are designed to lure new users and could be discontinued once the companies establish a core base of customers. “Now might be the fad season for poikatsu,” said Chuken, “but I’m not sure if this trend will still be around in four to five years.”</p>

                <p>According to CBI Insights, “running out of money” is the second of the <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top 20 reasons why businesses fail</a>. It’s not the only money-related issue. Pricing and cost issues, lack of a business model, and poor marketing intersect with monetization, too. Though monetization potential is very important, distribution is even more important!</p>
<p>A quick note, that the #1 reason, “no market need” is largely addressed by sticking to a <a href="https://perceptionbox.io/business/software-outsourcing-to-boost-startups-and-mvps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minimum Viable Product</a> (MVP) development process. The MVP process focuses on asking the tough questions first. Do customers love your product? Will they buy it? How much will they pay for it? These focus on finding a great product-market fit which also means creating a competitive product.</p>
<p>Distribution methods play a very important part in your software’s monetization potential.<br>
As <a href="https://www.smaato.com/blog/android-vs-ios-app-monetization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smaato</a> points out, “iPhone users spend on average over <a href="https://blog.soomla.com/2019/01/app-monetization-android-vs-ios.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$30 per online transaction</a>, compared to an average of $10 that Android users spend.” So, in all cases, you want to do your marketing research. Some of us on the marketing side have heard from tech companies that “They don’t need marketing.” With few exceptions – companies taking that stance either don’t last long or get bought out.</p>

            <h2>The Ease of Electronic vs. Packaged Distribution</h2>
    </p>

                <p>Say, you’re in the breakfast cereal business. If you get your product in Walmart and Kroger, you’ve done well. Do you stop there? No. There’s still Albertsons, Safeway, HEB, 7-11s, corner stores, restaurants, and hotel chains. But, you have to prove to each that your product is worthy of their shelf space. If your product has a $10 price tag, distributors and retailers will take at least half as their share. You have to cover the warehousing, cost of promotions, and damages.</p>
<p>Many mobile app developers place their apps on Google Play and the App Store and call their distribution efforts “done.” For a very lucky minority, this can work. Even so, it’s by no means optimal and it’s one reason (of many) why so many mobile apps never made money. For one thing, it’s super freakin’ lazy – to be polite about it.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your app meets store guidelines – you’re basically guaranteed “shelf-space.”</li>
<li>It takes, at most, two hours to set up a new app on independent app stores.</li>
<li>No warehousing, no shipping costs for downloads, no damages.</li>
<li>No expensive promotional displays.</li>
<li>Most online stores take just 30% of sales.</li>
</ul>
<p>Granted no independent app stores have nearly the traffic as the Big Two. However, that fact alone also makes it easier to get exposure on them and be a big fish in a small pond.</p>
<p>Your team has spent months developing a software project. It’s worth the effort to have one person spend a few days expanding its distribution channels. Each is a “point of presence” – and helps to develop branding a la McDonald’s or Starbucks. Overall, it costs the same to develop a software product whether it is ultimately delivered to one or one million people. The goal, as with any product, is to get it into the hands of as many customers as inexpensively as possible.</p>

<div>
                <p>Most everyone’s acquainted with packaged and downloadable premium software, freemium apps, and subscription models. Each has its own nuances to consider, but there are also a few options not so widely known – like pre-installed software distribution and white label options. We aren’t aiming to say any one is better than another – as it all depends upon your project, your target audience, and your budget.</p>
    </div>
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                

                            
                                
                                    
<p id="Packaged ">
            <h2>Packaged Software Distribution</h2>
    </p>
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                

                            
                                
                                
                                
                                    
<div>
                <div>
                <p>With the Internet, packaged software is the oddball as it incurs the extra cost and effort of developing <a href="https://site.handshake.com/blog/how-to-wholesale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brick-n-mortar retail distribution</a> channels. But, it is possible to forego the packaged distribution effort and simply make the hard copy materials a purchase option. Desktop titles typically include a DVD for installation and a user manual. Gaming companies often have collector editions adding maps, art books, and assorted game paraphernalia. Basic options typically incur a $10-20 surcharge on the price of the electronic version. Premium options can add $20 to $80, or more, to the cost.</p>
<p>Companies like Microsoft, Apple, Sony, and Electronic Arts, among others, have the economy of scale and distribution channels to get good mileage from packaged software. Other companies should validate every packaged software aspect with their user-base before jumping into it. Startups are likely better off avoiding packaged software unless there’s active end-user demand.</p>
<p>Demand can be evaluated via crowdfunding campaigns starting off with a small, first-run packaged edition. Additional options can be opened if funding benchmarks are reached. Alternatively, if sales of electronic versions go well, you can always expand your packaged options later. Nevertheless, any effort in selling or developing distribution channels for packaged software involves a very significant physical effort. Print On-Demand services can help streamline portions of the effort.</p>

<div>
                <div>
                <p>Exponentially easier to develop and manage if only because you don’t have to worry about inventory or physical distribution efforts. If you have a software product, a website, and a Paypal account, you could be in business today! Retail shelf space isn’t an issue either. As long as your software meets store policies you should have no problems getting on most online (non-brand specific) software or app stores.</p>
<p>Another advantage is that most online stores only take a 30% commission. Both the App Store and Google Play reduce their commissions on subscription-based apps to 15% after one year. If you are selling internationally, for best effect you should pro-rate your cover price to accommodate purchasing power parity with different countries.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, top-shelf software and brand names do best with premium sales. Their core advantage applies via the marketing and advertising dollars they can throw at promoting their products. Their advantage is magnified by promoting new releases across the user-base of all of their other products. With different product strategies, premium software can employ most other monetization options except in-app advertising.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2 id="whats-in-this-post">What’s in this post?</h2><p>Enough about the insides of Postgres indexes to impress your coworkers at the coffee machine or recruiters at a job interview 🤓.</p><p>We’ll have a look at B-Tree, Hash, GIN, GiST, BRIN indexes and focus on demystifying them.</p><h2 id="why-the-hell-do-i-even-need-an-index">Why the hell do I even need an index?</h2><p>Indexes are at the core of any querying in relational databases (the classic SQL databases like Postgres or MySQL). Therefore it is very rewarding and important to have an idea of how they work.</p><p>An illustration is worth a thousand words so let’s take an example. Let’s say we have a <code>user</code> table containing 1M million entries (or rows):</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>user</span> (
  id   SERIAL <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span>,
  name TEXT,
  age  INTEGER
);
</code></pre></div><p>We want to know how many of our users are above 30. We run:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> age <span>&gt;</span> <span>30</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Without any extra index, the database would have to go over the 1M entries one by one, look at their age and increment a counter for all the users above 30:</p><p><img src="https://fabien.herfray.org/images/mastering-postgres-indexes-in-10-minutes/scan.png" alt="scan"></p><p>If it feels like an inefficient way of getting the result it’s because it is 💁‍♀️. It would be a slow query (called a “full table scan”, as every row needs to be scanned).</p><p>That’s where indexation comes into play. It will allow us to quickly locate the users we’re interested in, without having to lookup all the rows.</p><p>In Postgres, there are 5 types of indexes:</p><ul><li>B-Trees</li><li>Hashes</li><li>GINs</li><li>GiSTs</li><li>BRINs</li></ul><h2 id="before-we-start">Before we start</h2><h3 id="naming">Naming</h3><ul><li><strong>Row</strong>: An entry in the database (e.g. a user). Also called tuple.</li><li><strong>Column</strong>: An attribute of a row (e.g. the first name of a user).</li><li><strong>Table</strong>: A collection of rows (e.g. a user table).</li><li><strong>TID</strong>: Tuple ID. It’s an internal Postgres ID. It describes where to find the row on the disk.</li><li><strong>Operator</strong>: Reserved keyword representing operations on data (e.g. <code>AND</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>=</code>).</li><li><strong>Statement</strong>: Database operation (e.g. <code>CREATE TABLE user (name TEXT);</code>).</li><li><strong>Query</strong>: Statement that returns data (e.g. <code>SELECT * FROM user;</code>)</li></ul><h3 id="core-assumptions">Core assumptions</h3><ul><li>In general, an index needs to be able to fit in RAM to be fully efficient. That’s why having very large indexes can be problematic.</li><li>Fetching the row behind a <code>tid</code> is easy and relatively cheap to do. We consider it roughly equivalent to getting an element from an array by index (e.g. <code>var a = array[i]</code>).</li><li>We’ll only talk about read operations (queries). How to propagate writes to indexes is a whole other story.</li><li>Everything is more complex and complicated in real life, this post tries to explain things on a very high level and may be approximate on some parts. For more details, one should have a look at the <code>Further explanation</code> links.</li></ul><h2 id="b-tree-indexes">B-Tree indexes</h2><h3 id="usecase">Usecase</h3><p>So we want to index this query. We want to make it faster:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> age <span>&gt;</span> <span>30</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>We create a B-Tree index on the <code>age</code> column.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> user_by_age <span>ON</span> <span>user</span> (age);
</code></pre></div><p>No need to specify anything, B-Tree is the default index for Postgres and many other databases including MySQL, Oracle or SQL Server.</p><h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work</h3><p>A binary search tree (<strong>different from a B-Tree</strong>) is a well known data structure where every node of the tree has two children nodes. The values of the left and right children being respectively smaller and larger than their parent’s value.</p><p>A B-Tree is a generalised binary search tree where every node can have more than two children.</p><p><img src="https://fabien.herfray.org/images/mastering-postgres-indexes-in-10-minutes/tree_comparison.png" alt="tree comparison"></p><p>A very helpful property of these trees is that their values are sorted. It makes it easy to lookup values. Exactly what we need to speed up our query!</p><p>Now a B-Tree index is slightly more than just a B-Tree. It is a linked list of tids, sorted by value and linked to a B-Tree.</p><p>Let’s run our query again and see how it looks like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> age <span>&gt;</span> <span>30</span>;
</code></pre></div><p><img src="https://fabien.herfray.org/images/mastering-postgres-indexes-in-10-minutes/btree.png" alt="btree"></p><p>That was much easier! By using the sorting of the tree nodes, we can now quickly find the first user being above 30 and count from there. Remember? The linked list at the bottom is sorted by age!</p><p>As a side note, you may be wondering about multicolumn indexes, like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> user_by_age_and_height <span>ON</span> <span>user</span> (age, height_cm);
</code></pre></div><p>The simplest way to visualize it is to imagine it as being roughly equivalent to a monocolumn index like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> user_by_age_and_height <span>ON</span> <span>user</span> (age<span>+</span><span>'-'</span><span>+</span>height_cm);
</code></pre></div><p>The B-Tree mechanism stays the same, but the values that are being sorted are now for example <code>28-182</code>.</p><p>This explains why the index wouldn’t help with trying to run:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> height_cm <span>&gt;</span> <span>160</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>In the tree, values like <code>28-182</code> are not sorted by height. They are sorted by age, and then for every individual age they are sorted by height.</p><p>On the other hand, the index would help us with this query:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> age <span>=</span> <span>30</span> <span>AND</span> height_cm <span>&gt;</span> <span>160</span>;
</code></pre></div><h3 id="tldr-too-long-didnt-read">TLDR (Too Long Didn’t Read)</h3><ul><li>B-Tree is the default index in many databases.</li><li>Is it so popular because it’s fast, efficient and flexible.</li><li>It makes operations like <code>=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>ORDER BY</code> or even <code>LIKE</code> faster.</li><li>A rule of thumb would be: if you need to speed up the above operations, use a B-Tree index unless there is a specific reason not to.</li></ul><h3 id="further-explanation">Further explanation</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.qwertee.io/blog/postgresql-b-tree-index-explained-part-1/">https://www.qwertee.io/blog/postgresql-b-tree-index-explained-part-1/</a></li><li><a href="https://habr.com/en/company/postgrespro/blog/443284">https://habr.com/en/company/postgrespro/blog/443284</a></li></ul><h2 id="hash-indexes">Hash indexes</h2><h3 id="usecase-1">Usecase</h3><p>We’re only querying using the <code>=</code> operator and we’re having very specific scaling/performance issues (e.g. our table is huge and a B-Tree would be too large to fit in memory). We want to index:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> name <span>=</span> <span>'Souleymane Laurence'</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>We create a Hash index on the <code>name</code> column.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> user_by_name <span>ON</span> <span>user</span> <span>USING</span> HASH (name);
</code></pre></div><p>This time, we need to specify it explicitely by adding <code>USING HASH</code> to our statement.</p><h3 id="how-does-it-work-1">How does it work</h3><p>Let’s think of our <code>user</code> table as a Java array for one second. We consider the position in the array to be equivalent to a <code>tid</code> in Postgres:</p><p>That’s how we’d naively lookup the users having the name <code>Souleymane Laurence</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java">User<span>[]</span> userTable <span>=</span> <span>{...}</span>

<span>int</span> i<span>;</span>
List<span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span> foundTids <span>=</span> <span>new</span> ArrayList<span>&lt;&gt;();</span>

		foundTids<span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span>i<span>)</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This is slow because we have to go over all the entries of the table one by one (remember, they could be hundreds of millions in a database).</p><p>Now couldn’t we find a way to remove this big for loop and predict in advance where are our rows going to be located in the array? Yes! And it’s called a <strong>hash function</strong>.</p><p>A hash function is capable of taking any input and translating it into a smaller subset of values:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>// Returns an int between 0 and 256. Always the same for the same input.
</span><span></span>hash_function_256<span>(</span><span>"Souleymane Laurence"</span><span>)</span>
<span>-&gt;</span> 147
</code></pre></div><p>We could use this as an array position! We just need to rearrange our table first:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java">User<span>[]</span> userTable <span>=</span> <span>{...}</span>

<span>int</span> i<span>;</span>
List<span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;[]</span> hashIndex <span>=</span> <span>new</span> List<span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;[</span>256<span>];</span> <span>// 256 hash values

<span>// Iterating over the rows of our table to populate our index.
</span><span></span><span>for</span> <span>(</span>i <span>=</span> 0<span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> userTable<span>.</span><span>length</span><span>;</span> i<span>++)</span> <span>{</span>

	hashIndex<span>[</span>hash<span>].</span><span>add</span><span>(</span>i<span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We just created our own hash index. Let’s now run our query again:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>// Our new index.
</span><span></span>List<span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;[]</span> hashIndex <span>=</span> <span>{...}</span>

List<span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span> foundTids <span>=</span> hashIndex<span>[</span>hash<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div><p>That’s it, and that was quick as hell 🔥. Back to SQL:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> name <span>=</span> <span>'Souleymane Laurence'</span>;

But the process is not always easy if you are used to working on Debian-like systems.<br>Today, we’ll see how to install it on a Raspberry Pi, to configure it and use it like almost like any other operating system.</p><p><strong>FreeBSD is an open-source operating system, available on Raspberry Pi since 2014. It’s a good solution for any usage (server or desktop)<br>It’s not based on Linux, as they develop their code for everything. Even if there are many similarities, it includes several differences, more or less visible.</strong><span data-ez-name="raspberrytips_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p><p><span data-ez-name="raspberrytips_com-medrectangle-4"></span>To help you as much as possible, I will start by an introduction to FreeBSD, then I’ll show you how to install it, and finally, everything you need to know to use it the way you want.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>I’m not an expert in BSD systems. I’m a fan of Pfsense which is based on FreeBSD, but I never really used it beside that. The goal here is only to share with you my notes about this system.</em></p><h2><span id="FreeBSD_introduction"></span>FreeBSD introduction<span></span></h2><h3><span id="Presentation"></span>Presentation<span></span></h3><p><strong>FreeBSD is not a new system, far from that. The first release comes in 1993! (same year as Debian).<br></strong>The main goal is to offer a lightweight system, with critical part related to stability. So you can use it almost anywhere.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="183" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI1MDAiIGhlaWdodD0iMTgzIj48L3N2Zz4=" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" ezimgfmt="rs rscb30 src ng ngcb30 srcset" data-ezsrc="https://raspberrytips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/freebsd-logo.jpg" data-ezsrcset="https://raspberrytips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/freebsd-logo.jpg 500w,https://raspberrytips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/freebsd-logo-300x110.jpg 300w"></figure></div><p>FreeBSD works on two branches :</p><ul><li><strong>STABLE</strong>: The main branch, each new major version is released from the STABLE branch (<strong>RELEASE</strong>)</li><li><strong>CURRENT</strong>: It’s the development branch, to get the latest improvements, but less speed and stability.</li></ul><div><div><div><p><a href="https://raspberrytips.com/master-raspberry-pi" target="_blank"><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIzMDAiIGhlaWdodD0iMjczIj48L3N2Zz4=" ezimgfmt="rs rscb30 src ng ngcb30" data-ezsrc="https://raspberrytips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603165223-300x273.jpg"></a></p><div><p><span>Master your Raspberry Pi in 30 days</span><br>From beginner to expert in Raspberry Pi.<br>Learn useful Linux skills and practice multiples projects with step-by-step guides.</p></div></div></div></div><h3><span id="Usage"></span>Usage<span></span></h3><p><strong>FreeBSD can be used in any situation. It’s fast, stable and secure</strong>. So it’s perfect for a Raspberry Pi, but also for a server or a desktop usage.<br>By the way, the FreeBSD FAQ is pretty clear about this:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Can FreeBSD replace my current operating system?<br></strong>For most people, yes.</p><cite><a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/introduction.html#:~:text=the%20FreeBSD%20Handbook.-,1.2.,any%20purpose%20without%20strings%20attached." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FreeBSD documentation</a></cite></blockquote><p>We’ll see in the next parts how to install it on your Raspberry Pi, but it’s also a solid system for your computer or on server.</p><p><strong>FreeBSD has been adopted by many companies over the world.<br></strong>I already told you about Pfsense, but other brands like IBM, Apple or Sony are using parts of the FreeBSD code (for example, the PlayStation 4 system is a fork from FreeBSD).<br>Some NAS operating systems are also based on FreeBSD (FreeNAS for example).</p><h3><span id="FreeBSD_vs_Linux"></span>FreeBSD vs Linux<span></span></h3><p>As I told you in introduction, <strong>FreeBSD is not a Linux-based system</strong>.<br>Systems on Linux, are all using the same kernel and basic drivers, and then add many applications to offer a specific solution at the end.</p><p><strong>FreeBSD don’t use this base, they develop and release everything, including the kernel and drivers.</strong><br>However, the differences while using it are minimal (I will show you the main ones).<br>But you may have some commands working differently on Linux and FreeBSD.</p><h3><span id="FreeBSD_strengths"></span>FreeBSD strengths<span></span></h3><p>So, why do I need to try FreeBSD if it’s almost the same thing?<br>As always when I test systems, the main goal here is to experiment, and see how it works. So you’ll get more details at the end.</p><p>But in theory, <strong><span data-ez-name="raspberrytips_com-large-leaderboard-2"></span>FreeBSD is a minimal system that should be faster, more secure and with less compatibility issues than most Linux systems</strong>.<br>We’ll see now if this is true for the Raspberry Pi version 🙂</p><h2><span id="Install_FreeBSD_on_Raspberry_Pi"></span>Install FreeBSD on Raspberry Pi<span></span></h2><p>In this part, we’ll see how to install a basic FreeBSD system on your Raspberry Pi.</p><h3><span id="Raspberry_Pi_4"></span>Raspberry Pi 4<span></span></h3><p>During writing this tutorial, <strong>the Raspberry Pi 4 is not yet supported on the RELEASE version</strong> (12.x). But it works on CURRENT version (13.x).</p><p>So, if you have a Raspberry Pi 4, consider taking the latest version available. Currently, the 13.x and above are the only working for Raspberry Pi 4.<br>Unfortunately, if t’s a CURRENT version, it’s a debug one, with less stability and performances issues. But for a test it’s ok.</p><p><span data-ez-name="raspberrytips_com-leader-1"></span>The other option is to use a custom firmware, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/pftf/RPi4"

id="Download"></span>Download<span></span></h3><p><strong>FreeBSD offers pre-built images for the ARM and ARM64 architecture.<br></strong>The ARM64 version is working fine on Pi 3B+ and 4, I didn’t test on other models.</p><p>Here is the general link to the FTP server: <a href="https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/snapshots/">https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/</a><br>Once here, you have two choices:</p><ul><li><strong>Download the RELEASE version:</strong><ul><li>Open the releases subfolder and go to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/ISO-IMAGES/" target="_blank">ISO-IMAGES</a>.</li><li>Select the version you want to install (12.1 for example).</li><li>Then, find the image corresponding to your Raspberry Pi model.<br>For example:<br><code>FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-arm64-aarch64-RPI3.img.xz</code><br>If you have the Raspberry Pi 3 (look for arm architecture, and the last part of the name correspond to the Raspberry Pi model).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Download the CURRENT version:</strong><ul><li>Go to snapshots and then <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/snapshots/ISO-IMAGES/" target="_blank">ISO-IMAGES</a>.</li><li>Select the version you want (13.0 for example).</li><li>Same thing here, find the FreeBSD images corresponding to your model, for example:<br><code>FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-arm64-aarch64-RPI3-20200813-r364182.img.xz</code><br>Currently, there is no specific version for the Raspberry Pi 4, so take the RPI3 one.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Download the file you need on this server, and feel free to ask in the comments if you are lost with this, or if I need to update it for the latest versions.</p><h3><span id="SD_card_preparation"></span>SD card preparation<span></span></h3><p>Once you have the image on your computer, the installation part is similar to what you may already know

modern programming languages. The point of the garbage collector is to free up
memory used by objects which are no longer being used by a program. Although
it's convenient for developers not to think about manually deallocating memory,
it can be a poisoned chalice that comes with several hard-to-predict downsides.</p><h2>When garbage adds up<a href="#when-garbage-adds-up" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Some garbage collectors completely halt the program's execution to make sure no
new objects are created while it cleans up. To avoid these unpredictable
<strong>stop-the-world</strong> pauses in a program, incremental and concurrent garbage
collectors were developed. Although they provide great benefit in many cases,
there's additional design choices that wind up back into development phases
where you have to indirectly deal with memory allocation.</p><p>Another issue is that garbage collectors themselves consume resources to decide
what to free up, which can add considerable overhead. Environments dealing with
real-time data are latency-sensitive and require high performance and
efficiency. In these applications, unpredictable halting behavior combined with
excess computation time or memory usage is not acceptable.</p><p>As we're building an open source high-performance time series database, we have
these environments in mind and use design patterns and tooling that focuses on
writing code that's efficient and reliable. When we need additional
functionality that would introduce performance knocks through standard
libraries, we can leverage our own implementations using native methods. This is
what prompted us to add a network stack that executes garbage-free.</p><p>This component bypasses Java's native non-blocking IO with our own notification
system. This component's job is to delegate tasks to worker threads and use
queues for events and TCP socket connections. The result is a new generic
network stack used to handle all incoming network connections.</p><h2>TCP flow control<a href="#tcp-flow-control" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>When we have multiple nodes on a network, there are usually disparities in their
performance in computing power and network bandwidth. Some nodes can read
incoming packets at different rates than others, or conversely, some nodes may
be able to send data at a different rate.</p><p>Let's say we have a network with two nodes; a sender and a receiver. If the
sender can produce a lot more data than the receiver can read, the receiver is
likely to be overwhelmed. We're in luck, though, as TCP uses a built-in flow
control protocol that acts as a pressure valve to ensure the receiver is not
affected by such cases.</p><p>Control flow manifests itself in different ways, depending on whether the
network socket is blocking or non-blocking. If the receiver can process data
faster than a sender, a non-blocking socket is identical to a blocking one, and
the receiver thread would be parked while no data is read. There's not much
concern about this situation if it happens infrequently, but the park and unpark
is a waste of resources and CPU cycles if the receiver is under heavy load.</p><p>Let's assume the receiver gets 0-length data on a non-blocking socket,
indicating no data has arrived from the sender; there are two options:</p><ol><li>Loop over socket reads continuously, waiting for data to arrive.</li><li>Stop looping and consult our parser on two possible actions to take: park for
more reads or switch to write.</li></ol><p>The first option is quite wasteful, so we went with the second approach. To park
socket read operations without blocking the thread, we need a dedicated system
for enqueuing and notifying us when the socket has more data to read. On the OS
kernel level, IO notification utilities exist as <code>epoll</code> on Linux, <code>kqueue</code> on
FreeBSD and OSX, and <code>select</code> on Windows. In QuestDB, we've implemented a
dispatcher that operates exactly as these IO notification systems for enqueuing
sockets, and we named it IODispatcher.</p><h2>Java NIO and garbage collection<a href="#java-nio-and-garbage-collection" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>As you would expect from cross-platform languages, the IO Notification system
must be abstracted away to make application code portable. In Java, this
abstraction is called <code>Selector</code>. If we were to oversimplify a typical
interaction with the IO Notification system, it would essentially be a loop.
More often than not, this is an infinite loop, or rather, it executes
continuously during the server's uptime.</p><p>Since we are on a quest to have everything garbage-free, Selector presents a
problem right away - the output of the selector is a set of keys, coming from a
concurrent hash map via an iterator. All of this allocates objects on every
iteration of the loop. If you are not careful, this allocation continues even
when the server is idling. The behavior is intrinsic to the Java Non-blocking
I/O (NIO) implementation and cannot be changed.</p><p>To send or receive data from the network, Java mandates ByteBuffer instances.
When looked at in a vacuum, ByteBuffer may seem like a reasonable abstraction.
But if we look closer, it's easy to see it's a bit confused. It is a concrete
class instead of an interface, meaning that the whole NIO is stuck with the
provided implementation. The API is inconsistent as the OS requires memory
pointers for send and receive methods, but ByteBuffer does not provide an
explicit semantic for each case. So how does ByteBuffer translate to a memory
pointer?</p><p>When your data is on the heap, there is a memory copy for each socket IO. When
ByteBuffer is direct, there is no copy, but there is an issue releasing memory
and general Java paranoia about language safety.</p><div><p>Native Java socket write implementation</p></div><p>Considering the allocating nature of the Selector, that Java NIO libraries are a
layer above the OS, and how computationally expensive the overhead is with
ByteBuffer, we decided to go out on a limb and interact directly with the OS via
the Java Native Interface (JNI). This worked for QuestDB insofar as the API is
non-allocating outside of the normal bootstrap phase and lets us work with the
memory pointers directly.</p><div><p>QuestDB's JNI call for sending data to a socket</p></div><h2>QuestDB's thread model<a href="#questdbs-thread-model" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Starting threads is expensive, and they're more often than not just wrappers for
the connection state. QuestDB operates a fixed number of threads to isolate the
database instance to specific cores and reduce the overhead of starting and
stopping threads at runtime. The actual threads are encapsulated by a WorkerPool
class.</p><p>The worker pool's idea is to have a simple list of "jobs" that all workers will
run all the time. Jobs themselves encapsulate "piece of work" and do not have
tight loops in them. Hence a job can simply return if IO is not available or the
queue is full or empty.</p><p>We have a notion of a "synchronized job." It is different from the definition of
"synchronized" in Java in that the QuestDB's thread never blocks. However,
synchronized jobs guarantee that only one thread can execute a job instance at
any moment in time.</p><h2>Introducing QuestDB's IODispatcher<a href="#introducing-questdbs-iodispatcher" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>IODispatcher is QuestDB's implementation of the IO Notification loop. We have
implemented <code>epoll</code>, <code>kqueue</code>, and <code>select</code>, so this works cross-platform. The
appropriate implementation is automatically chosen at runtime based on the OS.
The IODispatched API is message-driven via QuestDB's implementation of
non-blocking and non-allocating queues. These queues are outside of the scope of
this article, but you can read about them in our community
<a href="https://questdb.io/blog/2020/11/26/http-server-contribution">contribution from Alex Pelagenko</a>.</p><figure><img alt="A diagram of QuestDB's IODispatcher" height="284" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-12-10/iodispatcher-diagram.png" width="650"><figcaption>IODispatcher and queues for events, interest, and disconnections</figcaption></figure><p>IODispatcher is a synchronized job in context of QuestDB's thread model. It
consumes queues on the left and publishes to the queue on the right.
IODispatcher's main responsibility is to deliver socket handles (individual
connection identifiers), that are ready for the IO to the worker threads.
Considering that socket handles are read or written to by one thread at a time
the underlying IO notification system works in ONESHOT mode. This means socket
handle is removed from the IO notification system while there is socket activity
and re-introduced back when activity tapers off. Interacting with the IO
notification system is expensive. Worker thread will only recurse back to the
IODispatcher for enqueueing if there has been zero data from the socket for the
set period of time, which we call hysteresis.</p><p>You can find source code of the implementations of the IODispatcher for
<a href="https://github.com/questdb/questdb/blob/master/core/src/main/java/io/questdb/network/IODispatcherLinux.java" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">epoll</a>

and
<a href="https://github.com/questdb/questdb/blob/master/core/src/main/java/io/questdb/network/IODispatcherWindows.java" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">select</a>
on GitHub. Let's take a look at the components in the diagram above with an
outline of their purpose:</p><p><strong>IO Event Queue:</strong> Single publisher, multiple consumer queue. It is the
recipient of the IO events from as in epoll, kqueue, select. The events are
socket handles and the type of operation the OS has associated them with, e.g.,
read or write. The IODispatcher plays the publisher role, and any number of
worker threads are the consumers.</p><p><strong>Interest Queue:</strong> Multiple publisher, single consumer queue. Worker threads
publish socket handles and operations to this queue when IO is unavailable,
e.g., socket read or write returns zero. The IODispatcher will enqueue the
socket handle for more reads or writes as defined by the operation.</p><p><strong>Disconnect Queue:</strong> Multiple publisher, single consumer queue. Worker threads
publish socket handles to this queue destined to be disconnected from the server
and have their resources reused by other connections. The worker thread does not
disconnect the socket by itself because multiple threads may attempt to access a
data structure that is not thread-safe.</p><h3>Configuration<a href="#configuration" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>We disregarded ByteBuffer for not being an interface, so it would only be fair
for us to have interfaces in key places. One of these places is configuration,
which provides IODispatcher with basics such as:</p><ul><li>The IP address of the network interface</li><li>Port to bind to</li><li>Bias</li><li>Buffer sizes</li><li>Network facade</li><li>Clock facade</li><li>Connection context factory</li></ul><p>It's necessary to explain bias here, which might not be so obvious. When the TCP
connection is first accepted, it is enqueued for IO right away. The bias
provides an expectation of the initial …</p></section></div>

<h2>The crucial points</h2><p>• <strong>The number:</strong> The number of security guards was unusually high. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs regularly publishes a list of all foreign diplomats accredited to Norway. According to the diplomat list from the summer of 2018, the total number of Saudi diplomats in Norway at the time was 18. Both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the PST were surprised that the Saudis were about to almost double the number - with only security people.</p>
<p>• <strong>The status:</strong> Both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the PST were surprised that Saudi Arabia requested that the security guards be granted diplomatic status - and registered in the official <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/ud/dep/forbindelser/id447053/">Diplomat List</a>. It is unusual for security people at embassies to be registered as diplomats. Both diplomats and other embassy personell - arriving on a so-called «D-visa» to Norway - is given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_immunity">diplomatic immunity</a>. Which, as one of several benefits, means that the host country cannot arrest you if you commit a crime. But being registered formally as a diplomat gives you a wider range of benefits.</p><p>• <strong>The increase:</strong> Norwegian authorities reacted to the fact that the major increase in security staff did not reflect what they knew regarding the activity level at the embassy.</p><p>• <strong>The key role:</strong> Officials at PST have later noted that security personnel, from the consulate in Istanbul, played key roles in the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Dagbladet has learned.</p>
<p><strong>The PST declined to comment on this article, however, it has been presented with all the information herein – without finding any errors.</strong></p><figure data-zoomable="1">

<p>Guri Solberg, spokesperson at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, confirms in an e-mail to Dagbladet:</p><p>“In the summer of 2018, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs registered ten persons as new envoys at the Saudi Arabian embassy in Oslo. The status of other countries' envoys to embassies is regulated by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961) and the role of the envoy at the embassy. As these were mainly persons who were to have internal tasks at the embassy, nine of the ten persons were registered as administrative / technical personnel in accordance with normal practice. One of the ten people was registered as a diplomat based on their role and responsibilities. In practice, there is little difference in the degree of immunity and privileges granted to diplomatic, administrative, and technical personnel. The rules on immunity and privileges are dictated by international law by which Norway is bound, in particular the Vienna Convention of Diplomatic Relations, that includes immunity from criminal prosecution in the host state.”</p><figure data-zoomable="1">

<p>The men arrived in Norway at the end of July 2018. The one security guard who received the diplomatic status Saudi Arabia requested, now works as Head of Security at the Saudi Arabian embassy, according to Dagbladet's sources. He is formally listed in the Foreign Ministry's diplomatic list as an "attaché".</p><div>

<p>“It was a discussion. There are regulations for the type of status that the embassies' security people can hold whilst staying in Norway. They are not diplomats”, a source familiar with the case tells Dagbladet.</p><div id="factbox-73180109" aria-expanded="false" tabindex="1">
    <h2>Facts: Diplomatic immunity in Norway</h2>
        
    
        <p>According to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, all envoys from other countries have diplomatic immunity when they are working for their country’s embassy. This applies to both diplomats and administrative personnel, such as security staff. <br></p><p>However, different degrees of immunity are granted, according to the rank of the individual within the system. Only diplomats have full immunity. <br></p><p>Neither diplomats nor security staff at embassies can be prosecuted or subjected to taxation in Norway. Security staff (administrative personnel) do not, however, have immunity from civil proceedings arising from their conduct in private. Whilst diplomats can import as much as they desire tax-free for private use, administrative personnel are only exempt from customs duties on entry to a country. <br></p><p>Norway can sanction an envoy with diplomatic immunity by declaring them persona non grata in Norway.</p><p><em>Source: Ministry of Foreign Affairs</em></p>

<p>If you travel by sea to the Frognerstranda harbour, at times you can spot the Kingdom's characteristic green flag - with a white sabre, and the inscription "There is no god without Allah, and Muhammad is his prophet" - waving over the hedge. From a magnificent villa, designed in 1899 by the famed Norwegian architect Ingvar Hjorth, Saudi Arabia manages its activities in Norway.</p>
<p>Dagbladet has asked the Embassy in Oslo why they requested the security guards be granted diplomatic immunity, about the points Norway reacted to, about the Embassy’s relationship with the activist Iyad el-Baghdadi, and about why the Embassy wanted to increase the number of security guards by so many.</p><p><strong>The Embassy has declined to meet with Dagbladet, preferring to respond by email, with a press release originally sent out in 2019:</strong></p><p>"The Embassy is informed about what has been circulated in some media in regard to Mr. Iyad el-Baghdadi and the allegations against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Embassy would like to clarify that this person is not a Saudi citizen and is unknown to the Kingdom. What he said is fabricated and false and aims to offend the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We have been in contact with the Norwegian Government to provide the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with further information in this regard. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reserves the right to take the necessary legal measures against the mentioned-above in order to safeguard its rights."</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong></em> <em>Dagbladet received the following statement on Thursday 17th of December:</em></p><p><em>«The Embassy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reiterates what was released in 2019, and denies any previous knowledge or existing relationship between the Kingdom and Iyad el-baghdadi.</em></p><p><em>In regards to the issue concerning the security guards, these guards are positioned at the embassy to provide the necessary protection, around the clock, for both the Embassy building and the Head of Mission’s residence. Saudi embassies in several countries have received threats and have been targeted by terrorist attacks - the most recent of which being the incident at the Embassy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in The Hague.»</em></p><h2>Briefed by the PST</h2><p>In a spartan apartment in Oslo, Dagbladet meets Iyad el-Baghdadi.</p><div id="parallax-73159998">

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello and welcome to the seventh post in my series about learning Rust. In case you want to hit it from the start, <a href="https://levpaul.com/posts/rust-lesson-1/">here’s</a> a link to the first one! This entire series covers my journey from being a completely land-locked Gopher to becoming (hopefully) a hardened Rustacean, able to skitter the hazardous seabed of any application safely.</p><hr><p>This chapter covers a topic that engineers will have strong thoughts and feelings about, myself included. In college, I recall learning precisely zero about testing. This perhaps, because I studied Computer Science rather than Software Engineering? Alas, when I entered into my first real dev job it was a slightly jarring experience, figuring out how write tests for my code. In that nubile period, I can make no mistake in saying that test writing was <em>the</em> most tedious and painstaking task I can recall… (<em>Alongside waiting 2 minutes and thirty seconds for a our Java backend to compile</em>)</p><p>Mercifully, I’ve encountered many great engineers throughout my career whom took time to educate me, and I’ve grown to love testing. It once got to the point where testing was the sole driver for all code I wrote, via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a>, but now has come back around to something less intense. I find unit tests less helpful and instead, lean on acceptance/integration testing to capture most things.</p><p>Ultimately how and if you write tests will depend on a few key factors;</p><h5 id="1-development-style">1. Development Style</h5><p>Are you practicing Test-Driven Developement, or are you writing in a more conventional or exploratory way? In simpler terms - are you writing your tests before you code, as you code, or after you code?</p><h5 id="2-existing-tests">2. Existing Tests</h5><p>Does the project you’re working on contain existing test infrastructure? Can you answer yes to these questions?</p><ul><li>are unit/integration tests widespread in the project already?</li><li>do existing tests contain scaffolding that enables you to easily add more tests? (i.e. mocks/stubs of major dependencies)</li><li>is the test suite run automatically via continuous integration pipelines? If so, is the pipeline passing a programmatic requirement for all pull requests?</li></ul><p>The more yeses from these questions, the more likely change requests will come with at least a couple new test cases, no matter the development style of a contributor.</p><h5 id="3-barrier-to-extension">3. Barrier to Extension</h5><p>This is simply how hard it would be to add tests had there not been existing infrastructure in place. This could be for a brand-new project or in an older project that was missing a particular type of test (i.e. no integration tests).</p><p>My experience with Java has always been bad in this respect. The testing environment was so fragmented that you had to use different frameworks depending on what style test you were wanting, and you also had to integrate said frameworks with your build framework too, just to make them run. Go was a huge breath of fresh air for me here as it had testing built in as a first class citizen from day one.</p><hr><p>With all these factors in mind, it makes sense to view testing in <em>Rust</em> purely from the third point, as this is where a language has the most potential for enablement.</p><h3 id="11-writing-automated-testshttpsdocrust-langorgbookch11-00-testinghtml">11. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-00-testing.html">Writing Automated Tests</a></h3><p>Not to start on the wrong foot but straight off the bat this chapter managed to annoy me thoroughly by leading with this excerpt:</p><blockquote><p>In his 1972 essay “The Humble Programmer,” Edsger W. Dijkstra said that “Program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs, but it is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence.” That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to test as much as we can!</p></blockquote><p>I scratched my head and thought, “<em>this doesn’t sound right</em>”. So off I went to read <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html">The Humble Programmer</a> essay (which is fantastic). It became immediately obvious that Dijkstra had anything <em>but</em> an anti-testing sentiment. My guess is that the authors of the Rust Book may have just made a simple translation error. Take for example, the very next line of the essay. Dijkstra writes:</p><blockquote><p>The only effective way to raise the confidence level of a program significantly is to give a convincing proof of its correctness.</p></blockquote><p>No, Dijkstra isn’t talking about a formal proof. He’s talking about Test Driven Development in 1972. He continues:</p><blockquote><p>If one first asks oneself what the structure of a convincing proof would be and, having found this, then constructs a program satisfying this proof’s requirements, then these correctness concerns turn out to be a very effective heuristic guidance.</p></blockquote><p>One can only imagine the “Program testing” Dijkstra referred to in the original quote, could simply mean <em>manual testing</em> in today’s tongue. The Book missed a great opportunity to use Dijkstra to promote testing and instead we got only half of it. Oh well.</p><hr><h3 id="_setup_"><em>Setup</em></h3><p>I got a feeling that this chapter had a different author than previous ones, as the examples were numerous and verbose. I managed to skim over most of them as in essence the concepts were quite basic. Basic though, is a great quality in a testing framework.</p><h4 id="the-_basics_">The <em>Basics</em></h4><p>In no relevant order, let me talk about features of Rust testing that I loved.</p><p>First - tests are simple to add, just a <code>[#test]</code> annotation for a function and you’re off to the races. In Go you have to do two things - create a file that ends in <code>_test.go</code> <em>and then</em> write your test functions as</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>TestXxx</span><span>(</span><span>t</span> <span>*</span><span>testing</span><span>.</span><span>T</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>… Now let me tell you that I’ve reviewed unit tests in Go which had me scratch my head and ask myself <em>“how the f*** did these tests pass??"</em>. It turned out that after another 10 minutes of faffing about and running the tests locally, did I find the test had never been run! Along with many others in the package for the past 6 months! Why? Because someone forgot to capitalize the first letter of the test function names, meaning their <code>testMyProgramWorks</code> “tests” weren’t exported, meaning Go didn’t classify them as real tests. Add some copy-pasta and there we were…</p><p>Having a much simpler API for specifying tests is a big win in my book. Thank you, Rust.</p><h5 id="seamless-integration">Seamless Integration</h5><p>Next on my testing crushlist is Intellij+Rust-plugin testing integration. I can just hit <code>shift+F10</code> and the IDE will run the tests for my crate and spit out a summary with links to failures and stuff. For one reason or another, I never run my Go tests from Goland (Intellij for Go). I use the command line with filters to run tests in specific packages. I don’t even know if I’ve ever even <em>tried</em> to run Go tests in Goland!?</p><p>After getting excited about this, I decided to try the IDE’s debugger with an integration test. Again, it just worked! I’ve used a debugger once or twice in Go, but you have to use <a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve">Delve</a>, then find some tutorials for setting that up with your IDE… In practice, I’ve never felt it was worth my time to use a debugger in Go. I’m not <em>sure</em> this would change with Rust - but debuggers are definitely nice to have when you’re a newbie and want to get a stronger feel for what’s happening in your code. Very cool to have it in the IDE with zero effort.</p><h5 id="almost-seamless">Almost, Seamless</h5><p>As I continued my tool-driven gorge, I hovered over a polished button that had inlaid in it, “Run ‘Hello World’ with Coverage”. Oooooh, ahhhh, I ogled.</p><p>*<strong>click</strong>*</p><p><em>BZZZZZRRP!!!!</em></p><p>Oh no.</p><p><em>Code coverage is available only with nightly toolchain.</em></p><p>Well excuuuuuse me for being so <em>basic</em> that I only use the default <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">rustup</a> install… To reinforce this further, the Book slaps me with this one too,</p><blockquote><p>Benchmark tests are, as of this writing, only available in nightly Rust.</p></blockquote><p>I am a big fan of Go benchmarks. Possibly the most underrated aspect of the Go testing ecosystem. It’s basically the standard for figuring out how alloc-y a package is and gives you hard numbers in that respect. Maybe benchmark tests <em>aren’t</em> that good in Rust, given you have much stricter control over your allocs?</p><p>So for now, I’ll add nightly-rust to my list of things to understand, post-Book.</p><h4 id="ok-enough-tool-talk-_the-tests_">Ok enough tool talk, <em>The Tests!</em></h4><p>The Rust testing tool chain is simple and comprehensive. The <code>assert!</code> style macros are a godsend. Every test I write in Go starts with me importing the <a href="https://github.com/stretchr/testify">testify</a> library, just to get access to <code>assert</code>. Rust testing is close to what Go offers, but looks to have a clear edge, out of the box.</p><p>On the opposite end of the stick, I’m not a huge fan of coercing us to put unit tests within the module being tested. Splitting up test code from production code makes for easier reading. Thankfully, <a href="http://xion.io/post/code/rust-unit-test-placement.html">this post</a> showed me how to split your tests into a sibling module, so with some slight hacks it appears my woes are surmountable.</p><p>A point of confusion came about when the Book ended a section saying we can write tests to return <code>Result&lt;T,E&gt;</code>’s. Apparently this is an acceptable way to write tests over <code>assert!</code> macros… The Book doesn’t make a suggestion about which is more idiomatic, so until I’m convinced otherwise, I’ll stick with asserts.</p><h5 id="delight-me-more">Delight me more</h5><p>Rust continued to delight me by doing simple things that Go doesn’t, for example having sane <em>help</em> printouts for the test command. Just trying to figure anything out by running <code>go help test</code> (and yes, in that specific arg order) is an exercise in futility. Any time I have to figure out how to disable test caching in Go, it’s a visit to Uncle Google.</p><p>Simiplicity continues in Rust with sane ways to filter running tests, and a simple mechanism to arbitrarily partition your tests too, using the <code>#[ignore]</code> annotation.</p><h5 id="splitting-hairs">Splitting Hairs</h5><p>There is no logical division in Go to encourage splitting unit tests from integration tests. You have to make such a divide yourself. I love that Rust has thought deeper about this and there are patterns to follow for each case.</p><blockquote><p>There’s debate within the testing community about whether or not private functions should be tested directly, and other languages make it difficult or impossible to test private functions.</p></blockquote><p>I haven’t heard this debate before, I’m guessing it would go something along the lines of “test the contract, if that works then you’re good”. Whilst I wouldn’t buy it completely, I do find substantially more value in integration and acceptance testing than unit testing <em>every function</em>.</p><h3 id="_teardown_"><em>Teardown</em></h3><p>Both Rust and Go have testing as first class citizens, but Rust wins for ease of use and …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		

<p>Change is hard. Explaining that change in a way that makes sense is hard. Not getting frustrated when someone is explaining change to you, or while explaining it is hard. We are all human, so please be patient. But, before you get angry, please read this. I’ve been surfing <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/centos?lang=en">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/k95dt7/centos_project_shifts_focus_to_centos_stream/">Reddit</a>, and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25345428">HackerNews</a> threads just like many others. I’ve gathered some major buckets of complaints which seem to come up, and I’d like to address each of them.</p>
<p>Before I start, full disclosure, I work at Red Hat and I’ve been here 9.5 years. I’ve never missed a paycheck. Never. Not one time. It’s always been there on payday. That makes me happy, but just because you work somewhere doesn’t mean you check your brain at the door. I am constantly questioning what we are doing, and coming to my own conclusions. A work relationship is like any other relationship, and it must be evaluated from time to time. Like any rational human being, I do this every now and then. I’m also known for saying my mind, even when the truth is difficult to hear. I think this makes me a decent diplomat for tough conversations. That said, these are my opinions and thoughts, not Red Hat’s.</p>
<p>Let’s have a tough conversation here. There are a lot of complaints and some optimism about the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/centos-stream-building-innovative-future-enterprise-linux">CentOS to CentOS Stream change</a>. Let’s dissect each of what I consider legitimate complaints:</p>





<h2><span id="1_This_Was_Communicated_Poorly">#1 This Was Communicated Poorly</span></h2>
<p>As I said in the introduction, messaging is hard. We are all human, even the people at Red Hat. Do I think it’s possible that this could have been communicated better? Sure. That said, I’ve seen a lot of people tossing hate toward Rich Bowen (<a href="https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/">CentOS Project shifts focus to CentOS Stream</a>) as well as Chris Wright (<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/centos-stream-building-innovative-future-enterprise-linux">CentOS Stream: Building an innovative future for enterprise Linux</a>) who wrote the two main pieces which communicated this change.</p>
<p>That’s not fair. These are both stand up guys. I mean seriously. I met Rich many moons ago because I had read and used his Apache docs. I went up to him and said thank you with nervousness. This guy believes in open source, more than most. He not only uses, he contributes. Big time. Same with Chris. I’ve never seen anyone who gets open source more than Chris. Seriously, when you listen to him speak you can discern how deeply he thinks about it. He is committed to it. If Red Hat ever changed their stance on open source, I am 100% sure that both of these guys would leave. There’s no conspiracy here, not with these guys. I know them both personally, and I believe in both of them. When these guys get up and say something, it’s true to the best of their knowledge at the given time. But, the world changes, and so do strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, this is a big change, and many people were involved, from both the community and from Red Hat. In fact, I’m writing this blog because I have a bias towards contribution and I believe it’s all of our responsibility to try to communicate this change effectively. Will Red Hat live and learn from this messaging? Yes, I believe so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My only ask is, please extend some goodwill to Red Hat and see how this change goes. Give it a chance. I believe it will actually be better in the long run, and more sustainable.</p>

<h2><span id="2_Things_Changed_I_Don8217t_Like_Change">#2 Things Changed, I Don’t Like Change</span></h2>
<p>This brings me to the next most common gripe I hear. I get it it. Please try to separate your anger that is a direct result of unwanted change, from the other things discussed in this blog. Every time I’ve ever went through a re-org at work, changed roles, changed companies, bought a house, had a child or remodeled a room in my house, I’ve sort of had this “who moved my cheese” feeling. Everything was one way, now it’s another. Being annoyed by change is legitimate, but ask yourself what the benefits might be?</p>

<p><a href="http://crunchtools.com/files/2020/12/9780399144462_l.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="http://crunchtools.com/files/2020/12/9780399144462_l.jpg" alt="" width="254" height="400"></a></p>
<p>Already, some people have proposed some benefits to this change, and I agree. I’m going to summarize the benefits I’ve seen from three different sources [1][2][3] and add some of my own thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It makes RHEL development more transparent and reliable [1]</strong> – historically, once a RHEL release snapped from Fedora it became a black box. Red Hat tries to solve this by creating Alpha and Beta releases which we share with customers and partners. We spend a tremendous amount of time/energy/money (as a PM I have to answer bunches of questions about Alpha/Beta), but literally almost nobody uses them. It’s expensive and painful. CentOS Stream will change this. Now any CentOS Stream user will have access to and be able to participate in this process. This is amazing.</li>
<li><strong>It provides a way for ISVs and developers to contribute fixes and features [1]</strong> – Even when partners and customers would use Betas/Alphas it was difficult for them to contribute changes back. None of the branches/repositories were public. Remember, the source code at git.centos.org is basically read only, downstream code from RHEL. That’s how Red Hat complies with the GPL. Technically we go above and beyond because we are only legally required to provide code to customers, and not required to provide code for BSD/Apache/etc licensed code, only attribution. Nonetheless, this was not a community, this was a code repository. The RHEL code was more akin to Android’s read-only, versus Kubernetes’ or the Linux kernel’s read-write community. With CentOS Stream, this all changes.</li>
<li><strong>It provides a way for the community to provide feedback [1]</strong> – Partners have special people dedicated to them called partner managers, and historically these partner managers help partners provide feedback and drive changes to the RHEL repositories. Community CentOS users (and even Fedora users) never had a way to drive changes into RHEL minor releases. Fedora drives changes into major releases, but there was a black box with minor releases. This gave RHEL the perception of being insulated from the upstream community, and it was. With CentOS Stream, this all becomes transparent. It’s a noble goal, and I genuinely believe this is better.</li>
<li><strong>Moving to a rolling stream is a consequence of moving to a cloud native world [2]</strong> – this was an interesting one and I hadn’t thought about this. This is a consequence of the world of containers. I always understood the value of containers to control when you absorb updates into your application dependencies, but it also means that a rolling stream of OS updates just doesn’t matter anymore. Now that containers control when the updates occur, why even care about whether it’s a rolling stream or released with version numbers. Do a “podman build” after the minor release drops in RHEL and don’t update again until the next dot release – boom, you have something quite similar to downstream CentOS Stream. A rolling stream lets us move faster and freer.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t underestimate the value of working directly with Red Hat engineering [3]</strong> – As Neal points out, CentOS was always a community driven project. Red Hat had extended it’s brand to the CentOS brand, and perhaps mistakenly given the perception that this was a well funded project when in fact it never was. Like every community driven project I have ever seen, there are more wants and desired than time and energy. Maintenance of community driven projects is not wholly unlike non-profits where a sort of depression permeates because it feels like you are never making enough progress, and worse you feel like you’re not being appreciated by the people who benefit from the charity. CentOS stream will be directly integrated with Red Hat engineering providing a direct line to RHEL. These are people paid to do this work, in service of making RHEL better. This aligns incentives and makes it much more sustainable, but more importantly, it creates a natural communication channel between Red Hat engineering and the community which frankly never existed. This will keep RHEL engineering more in touch with the realities of user needs, and provide the community a sense of connectedness. This is a very positive move.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t underestimate the power picking up a thousand new smart, highly motivated power users with a bias towards contribution, not consumption [4]</strong> – I haven’t seen anyone highlight this value yet. There are thousands of Solutions Architects, Consultants, Engineers, Product Managers, Product and Technical Marketing Managers, and Evangelists at Red Hat. None of them had an incentive to talk about CentOS much less contribute to it. I haven’t used CentOS in 9 years because I like getting a pay check. I was annoyed when customers wanted to talk to me about CentOS. I never contributed. I didn’t hate it, but I always viewed it as a wash – it garnered users of Red Hat technology, but these users very rarely contributed. I’ve never even seen a CentOS user file a RHEL issue (aka Bugzilla) or ping me on Twitter for CRI-O, Podman, Buildah, Skopeo, or anything else I work on at Red Hat. These users weren’t even on my radar. About a month ago, I installed CentOS Stream so that our team could collaborate with a customer on some Podman development. I didn’t have to feel dirty about pointing them to a downstream rebuild. With an upstream rebuild, the feedback is all directly useful to RHEL – feature requests, bugs, etc. This is powerful.&nbsp;</li>

<h2><span id="3_The_Life_Cycle_Commitment_Was_Changed">#3 The Life Cycle Commitment Was Changed</span></h2>
<p>The complaint is that the CentOS wiki originally said that CentOS 8 would be supported until 2029, and that this seems particularly egregious since CentOS 6 was recently deprecated. I totally understand being upset by this if you already had your heart set on using this, but think about why you’re upset?

December 14, 2020 | https://security.christmas/2020/15 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://security.christmas/2020/15">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><section><p>The year was 1996, and it’s the 11th of November. Macarena is topping the charts, Bill Clinton wins his second presidential term, and an article in a very peculiar e-zine is published which would change the world of information security forever. The publication in question was Phrack, an e-zine for and by hackers. The article in question was Aleph One’s “Smashing the Stack for fun and profit”, thus began what many regards as the golden age of software exploitation.</p>
<p>Smashing the stack for fun and profit was the first-ever article to in detail describe the buffer overflow vulnerability. Sure, buffer overflows were already being exploited in the wild prior to the release of Aleph One paper, but it had never been documented to this extent before. A lot has happened since the golden days. We have 64 bit-systems, compiler protections, kernel protections, and so on. While the examples from the paper aren’t possible without some dangerous compiler tweaks, the essence of the stack-based buffer overflow is still the same.</p>
<h2>Buffer Overflows</h2>
<p>So, what is a buffer overflow? An easy way to explain it is to imagine a spreadsheet containing a list of items. Each item has an id, a name, and a price. Imagine has implemented a very poor system for updating the items.</p>
<p>Now, what would happen if someone entered in a bunch of A’s while updating the name? Since this terrible spreadsheet app lacks bounds checking on the name, the value of name overflows into the price field. Now the price of the third item is 9 A’s. If we think a little more creatively about this, this means that we are able to write anything we want to the price field by carefully crafting a payload, that allows us to set the price to 1. Now that would be bad for business.</p>
<p>Ok, now we know the essence of what a buffer flow is, but what about the stack?</p>
<h2>The Stack</h2>
<p>Imagine a stack of plates, you can put (push) another plate on top of the already stacked plates, and you can remove a plate (pop) from the stack. I won’t go into great detail about how it works, but what you need to know is that each program executed by the operating system has its own stack, but instead of dinner plates the stack stores stack frames. You see, every time a program calls a function, it pushes a new stack frame on the stack. This frame contains the parameters for the function, its variables, and data needed to get back to the previous frame.</p>
<h2>The Return Pointer</h2>
<p>An important part of data needed to return from the function is the return pointer. It stores the memory address for where to resume execution after a function has been called. You can think of this part of the stack frame as the price field from the spreadsheet example. If you can overwrite the return pointer, you may redirect the code flow of the program.</p>
<h2>Exploitation</h2>
<p>But how do we redirect the code flow? The classic way, as described in smashing the stack, is to use shellcode. Shellcode is raw machine code, which typically executes a command shell. The attack creates the payload, by figuring out how much input is needed in order to overflow the return pointer. This is typically done by trial and error with the aid of a debugger. Next, the attacker uses the debugger to find the location of where the shellcode will end up in memory. If the exploit is successful, it will overflow the return address with the location of the shellcode, start executing the shellcode.</p>
<p>Now a lot has happened since the 90s, and the buffer overflow like it is presented in smashing the stack for fun and profit is no longer exploitable on modern systems. However, as application hardening evolved so did the techniques for exploitation.</p>
<p>The first defense against these sorts of attacks was NX, non-executable stack. This mitigation prevents code being executed in regions of the stack meant for data. This mitigation prevents the use of shellcode on the stack, but from this a very clever trick was discovered.</p>
<h2>Return-To-Libc</h2>
<p>As I mentioned, the return pointer has to point to a valid memory address. We cannot redirect code execution to somewhere on the stack, as it is marked as non-executable. But what if we point it to somewhere that already exists? Enter the return-to-libc technique. The concept is simple, we jump to a already existing function that will allow us to get code execution. There's multiple way to do this, but the most popular is to jump to the c library function <code>system()</code>.</p>
<p>We can't jump directly into <code>system()</code>, as it needs to be called with a useful string such as <code>/bin/sh</code>. In order to pull this off, we can leverage program instructions that modify cpu registers or the stack, as long as they are followed by a return instruction. The return instruction moves the stack pointer, meaning that we can chain together multiple instructions, as it will return into the next memory address we supply on the chain. These instructions are known as gadgets. By using this technique, we can write the string <code>bin/sh</code> in the register that is used as the first function parameter (on 32-bit systems, functions parameters are pushed onto the stack instead).</p>
<h2>ROP</h2>
<p>Actually, we don't even need access to library functions at all. If we chain together enough gadgets in a clever way, we can execute directly by using a system call. This is known as return-oriented programming (ROP) and is actually Turing complete! Meaning we can make the program to behave in any way we desire. Some people have actually implemented programming languages that run on top of a vulnerable program using return-oriented programming!</p>
<h2>Stack Cookies, ASLR and PIE</h2>
<p>Further attempts were made to stop exploitation, but they only succeed at making exploitation more involved. Like stack cookies, a special numeric value placed before the return pointer. If you corrupt this value, execution will terminate. However, these can be leaked and in some cases brute-forced.</p>
<p>Next we have ASLR, or address space layout randomization. This mitigations offsets memory addresses with a random value. This can be defeated by leaking addresses in order to calculate the offset.</p>
<p>The last one we're going to cover is Position Independent Executables or PIE for short. This mitigation is used in combination with ASLR. PIE randomly shuffles each section of the program i.e., we no longer know where anything is in memory. This makes leaking a lot more complicated, but it is defeatable by getting the right memory leaks.</p></section></article></div></div>]]>

Although we contribute to Nexus, it is not necessary to use it alongside Prisma. <a href="https://www.prisma.io/">Find out more</a> about what Prisma offers and how to use it.</p><h2 id="what-is-nexus"><a href="#what-is-nexus" aria-label="what is nexus permalink"></a>What is Nexus?</h2><p>Nexus offers a way to build code-first GraphQL APIs in Node. The code-first approach to building a GraphQL API is in contrast to the (potentially more common) schema-first approach.</p><p>Most developers that are new to building GraphQL APIs start out by taking the schema-first approach that has been popularized by companies like Apollo and their Apollo Server offering.</p><p>With the schema-first approach, writing the GraphQL API requires a set of <strong>type definitions</strong> and accompanying <strong>resolvers</strong>. A simple schema-first server might look like this:</p><pre><code>type Post <span>{</span>
  <span>id</span><span>:</span> ID<span>!</span>
  <span>title</span><span>:</span> String<span>!</span>
  <span>body</span><span>:</span> String<span>!</span>
<span>}</span>
type Query <span>{</span>
  <span>posts</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>Post<span>]</span><span>!</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre><pre><code><span>const</span> Query <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  posts<span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
      id<span>:</span> <span>'1'</span><span>,</span>
      title<span>:</span> <span>'My first GraphQL server'</span><span>,</span>
      body<span>:</span> <span>'How I wrote my first GraphQL server'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>]</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre><p>While the schema-first approach is easy to get started with, it comes with some inherent drawbacks that can make development difficult when applications start getting bigger.</p><p>Nexus takes a different approach to building GraphQL APIs. Instead of keeping a separate schema and set of resolvers, with Nexus, schemas and resolvers are written in the same spot using code.</p><p>Refactoring the Post example above to Nexus would look like this:</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> objectType<span>,</span> queryType<span>,</span> makeSchema <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'nexus'</span>

<span>const</span> Post <span>=</span> <span>objectType</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>

</code></pre><p>There are numerous benefits to taking a code-first approach with Nexus, including:</p><ul><li>Schema and resolver co-location</li><li>SDL and type generation</li><li>No need for extra tooling</li></ul><h3 id="schema-and-resolver-co-location"><a href="#schema-and-resolver-co-location" aria-label="schema and resolver co location permalink"></a>Schema and Resolver Co-location</h3><p>When building a schema-first GraphQL API, it is common to start out by placing all type definitions and resolvers in a single file. When both the schema and the resolvers live next to one another, it's fairly straightforward to work in both at the same time.</p><p>As the application grows, however, it is most often desired to move parts of the schema into their own separate modules and files. It's at this point that working on a GraphQL API becomes a bit more tedious. With this modularization comes the need to switch back and forth between the Schema Definition Language and JavaScript/TypeScript to write the resolvers. Not only does one need to constantly switch between files, they also need to do a context switch mentally to work between the two langauges.</p><p>With Nexus, our schema and its resolvers are always defined together. Nexus also allows us to write everything in a common language. This allows us to side-step the co-location/context switching issue altogether and helps us to be more productive, even as our applications grow to be quite large.</p><h3 id="automatic-type-and-schema-definition-language-generation"><a href="#automatic-type-and-schema-definition-language-generation" aria-label="automatic type and schema definition language generation permalink"></a>Automatic Type and Schema Definition Language Generation</h3><p>One major benefit of using Nexus is its ability to automatically generate TypeScript types and GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) files. The generated types are useful for adding extra type safety to the code used to power your GraphQL API. The generated SDL files can be used for many purposes. For example, we can configure our editors to know about the shape of our APIs to give us introspection for the queries and mutations we write.</p><p>Type and SDL generation comes for free with Nexus and can be enabled by supplying some configuration in the <code>makeSchema</code> call.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> path <span>from</span> <span>'path'</span>

</code></pre><h3 id="changes-to-nullability"><a href="#changes-to-nullability" aria-label="changes to nullability permalink"></a>Changes to Nullability</h3><p>In previous versions of Nexus, fields were treated as non-nullable by default. This differed from other GraphQL API frameworks which would treat fields as nullable unless otherwise specified. The Nexus authors took this approach because allowing fields to be non-nullable by default posed some long-term risks for API development.</p><p>The default nullability for fields has now been inverted in Nexus so that we can align with GraphQL best practices and expectations, specifically from the authors of GraphQL.</p><p>At Nexus 1.0, you need to explicitly make fields non-null:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> Post <span>=</span> <span>objectType</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>

  <span>title</span><span>:</span> String<span>!</span>
  <span>body</span><span>:</span> String<span>!</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre><p>The code for the <code>Post</code> object type above uses a property called <code>nonNull</code> which offers a bit more flexibility for specifying that fields should be non-null. It's useful for situations where the chaining API is not ideal, such as expressing deeply-nested types and when programmatically creating non-nullable types.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> queryType<span>,</span> stringArg<span>,</span> nonNull <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'nexus'</span>

<span>}</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre><p>The <code>nonNull</code> function accepts an argument which can be used to specify the type for a type or argument.</p><p>While fields are now nullable by default, it's possible to change this behavior either globally or at the type level in your Nexus API.</p><div><pre><code><span>queryType</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>

  <p><em>This article belongs to a series of articles about caching. The code in this article can be found at <a href="https://github.com/wb14123/redis_lease">my Github repo</a>.</em></p>

<ol>

  <li><em>Redis Implementation for Cache and Database Consistency. (This one)</em></li>
</ol>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.binwang.me/2020-11-02-Use-TLA+-to-Verify-Cache-Consistency.html">last article</a>, we introduced an algorithm (described in paper <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/papers/memcache-fb.pdf">Scaling Memcache at Facebook</a>) that can do a better job to maintain the data consistency between cache and database. We also used TLA+ to model the algorithm and verified it. In this article, we are going to implement the algorithm in real world for Redis. The implementation is very simple and doesn’t need to change Redis itself. It’s implemented it by using Redis script. However, it’s much harder to verify the correctness. In order to do it, I used <a href="https://jepsen.io/">Jepsen</a> to test it. If you look at the language analysis for the Github repo, you can see most of them are tests. The Redis script implementation, which is written in Lua, is only 5.1% of the project.</p>

<h2 id="algorithm-description">Algorithm Description</h2>

<p>We’ve described the algorithm in the previous article and even write a TLA+ model for it. But just make it easier for the readers, I’ll briefly describe the algorithm here again. Basically, whenever the client get a value from cache, it will be assigned a unique ID (lease) for the key. When the client writes back a new value, it needs to provide the  key’s newest lease ID. And delete the key will also invalidate all its leases.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>The implementation uses <a href="https://redis.io/commands/eval">Redis script</a>, which is written in Lua. It can implement multiple operations and make them atomic. In theory, this can also be done by client, but Redis script provides a consistent implementation across different clients and makes it easier to use. The algorithm is easy, so the implementation is also straight forward. The implementations are under <a href="https://github.com/wb14123/redis_lease/tree/master/scripts">scripts directory of the repo</a>. These scripts also works for Redis cluster (but I didn’t use Jepsen to test it under cluster mode). Here is an example implementation for get:</p>

<div><div>
  <div><pre><span> <a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a></span><span>local</span> <span>key</span> = <span><span>'</span><span>{</span><span>'</span></span>..KEYS[<span>1</span>]..<span><span>'</span><span>}</span><span>'</span></span>
<span> <a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a></span><span>local</span> <span>token</span> = ARGV[<span>1</span>]
<span> <a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a></span><span>local</span> <span>value</span> = redis.call(<span><span>'</span><span>get</span><span>'</span></span>, key)
<span> <a href="#n4" name="n4">4</a></span><span>if</span> <span>not</span> value <span>then</span>
<span> <a href="#n5" name="n5">5</a></span>    redis.replicate_commands()
<span> <a href="#n6" name="n6">6</a></span>    <span>local</span> <span>lease_key</span> = <span><span>'</span><span>lease:</span><span>'</span></span>..key
<span> <a href="#n7" name="n7">7</a></span>    redis.call(<span><span>'</span><span>set</span><span>'</span></span>, lease_key, token)
<span> <a href="#n8" name="n8">8</a></span>    <span>return</span> <span><span>{</span><span>false</span>, token<span>}</span></span>
<span> <a href="#n9" name="n9">9</a></span><span>else</span>
<span><strong><a href="#n10" name="n10">10</a></strong></span>    <span>return</span> <span><span>{</span>value, <span>false</span><span>}</span></span>
<span><a href="#n11" name="n11">11</a></span><span>end</span>
</pre></div>

<div><div>
  <div><pre><span><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a></span>redis-cli evalsha &lt;script_sha1&gt; 1 &lt;key&gt; &lt;uniq_id&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It will return <code>value, nil</code> if there is value for the key, or <code>nil, lease</code> if there is no value.</p>

<p>One optimization here is, if we have value for the key, we will not store the lease. That’s because in our use case, if we can get the value, we will not get it from database and write back to the cache. This avoids a lot of memory overhead.</p>

<p>Another important decision I made is, when get the value, the client needs to provide a unique ID instead of let Redis provide one. This is because I cannot find a good way to generate unique ID in Redis cluster. In a single instance, it’s easy: just use a key and inc the value each time. You can still generate unique IDs for different keys on a cluster, but it adds a lot of memory overhead. So I decided to let clients provide it. Luckily, it’s not hard, basically every language has UUID implementation and that’s good enough.</p>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

<p>It’s easy to implement something, but very hard to make sure it’s correct. We can use TLA+ to model the algorithm and explore the state space, or use mathematical method to proof the correctness in theory. But once we implement the algorithm, it’s something different. We cannot make sure it’s exactly the same as what we’ve proofed. That’s why I find using Coq to implement, proof and generate real code is fantastic. But in this case, it’s not implemented in Coq, so we must find some other way to test it. By testing, we still cannot make sure it’s 100% correct, we can just explore as many situations as we can and make sure the system doesn’t behaves in a way we don’t expect.</p>

<p>The tool we use here is <a href="https://jepsen.io/">Jepsen</a>. It provides lots of tools to make it easy to test distributed systems. It can generate many concurrent requests, import different kinds of failures (host down, network partition, clock drift, and so on) to the system, record all the requests and responses, and check the history at the end.</p>

<p>Here is the test case I write: for each client, generate random read and write operations. For read operation, read from cache first, if the value is not found, read from database and write back to the data. For write operations, write to the database and delete the key from cache. Then after all the read and write operations, check whether the data in cache and database are the same. The test case is very simple, it implemented the way we would use the cache.</p>

<p>By providing different arguments to the test command, you can run the test case with raw Redis get/set/del operations, or use get/set/del operation implemented by the scripts. You can also import cache failure during the test.</p>

<p>If we run the test with raw Redis operations, we can find the test is failed. In the last article, we discussed that using plain get/set/del cache operations cannot guarantee cache consistency, so this is expected. If we run the test with our scripts, we can find the test passed. If we run the test with cache system failure, we can see the test failed, which is also expected from last article. The inconsistent because of cache failure can be resolved by clean up cache data after restart. But if the client is failed, it will have the same problem (I didn’t write the test case for this because it’s hard to test client failure in Jepsen), but it’s not a very good idea to cleanup cache in this case. Because client fails all the time, cleanup cache will make operations slow. The best way might be to setup an expire time so the data can be consistent after the key is expired.</p>

<p>Even though all the test result is expected, it doesn’t make sure the implementation is correct, since there are still many situation I didn’t test, like Redis cluster, network partition, database failure and so on. So welcome to add new test cases and break the system!</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Einstein has once confidently pointed out that under the assumptions of special relativity, matter, anything that has weight, cannot travel faster than constant light speed $c$.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to use two mathematical approaches to show that why this is the case.</p>

<h3 id="relativistic-momentum-approach">Relativistic Momentum Approach</h3>

<p>In my previous blog <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Relativistic-Momentum-Relativistic-Mass/">post</a>, I have derived the expression of relativistic momentum.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
p &amp;= m_r v \\
&amp;= \gamma m_0 v \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $m_r$ is the relativistic mass at the velocity of $v$, and $m_0$ is the rest mass which does not change with velocity.</p><p>

\[\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\]

</p><p>Newtonâ€™s second law states that the rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the force applied, and this change in momentum takes place in the direction of the applied force.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
F &amp;= \frac{dp}{dt} \\
&amp;= \frac{d(m_r v)}{dt} \\
&amp;= \frac{d(\gamma m_0 v)}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{d(\gamma v)}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{d\bigg(\frac{v}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\bigg)}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{d\bigg(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{v^2} - \frac{1}{c^2}}}\bigg)}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{d ( v^{-2} - c^{-2} )^{-\frac{1}{2}}}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{-\frac{1}{2} ( v^{-2} - c^{-2} )^{-\frac{3}{2}} (-2) v^{-3} dv}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{ ( v^{-2} - c^{-2} )^{-\frac{3}{2}} (v^{2})^{-\frac{3}{2}} dv}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{ \big( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \big)^{-\frac{3}{2}} dv}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \big( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \big)^{-\frac{3}{2}}  \frac{dv}{dt} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We could easily see that if we apply a constant force to matter, as the velocity $v$ of matter approaches $c$, $\big( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \big)^{-\frac{3}{2}} \rightarrow \infty$, the apparent acceleration $\frac{dv}{dt} \rightarrow 0$, meaning that the apparent acceleration becomes smaller with the constant force applied on the matter. When $v = c$, to make the matter travel faster than light, you would need to have a tiny apparent acceleration $\frac{dv}{dt}$. However, in this time, since $\big( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \big)^{-\frac{3}{2}} = \infty$, we would need to apply infinity large force $F$ to the matter, which is not plausible.</p>

<h3 id="mass-energy-equivalence-approach">Mass-Energy Equivalence Approach</h3>

<p>In my previous blog <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Mass-Energy-Equivalence-Derivation/">post</a>, I have also derived the mass-energy equivalence.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
E &amp;= m_r c^2 \\
&amp;= \gamma m_0 c^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $m_r$ is the relativistic mass at the velocity of $v$, and $m_0$ is the rest mass.</p>



<p>We could easily see that as the velocity $v$ of matter approaches $c$, the Lorentz factor $\gamma \rightarrow \infty$, and the total energy of the matter $E \rightarrow \infty$. Based on the energy conservation, we would need to supply infinity energy to the matter to archive velocity $c$, which is not plausible.</p>

<p>In the fall of 2018, we noticed that there was something that set Google apart from other big tech companies. Everybody was talking about how to regulate these tech companies, and everybody had pretty good plans for how to do it — for every company besides Google. In our opinion, it was because nobody really seemed to understand what Google does, or how they do it. So, for the past two years, we’ve been researching and analyzing Google. Through this work, we’ve found some really compelling evidence about what powers Google’s monopoly, so much so that <a href="https://knuckleheads.club/2020/10/07/we-crawled-our-way-into-the-big-tech-antitrust-report/">Congress referenced this work as part of their recently released Big Tech Antitrust Report</a>. The big ideas that we have is that that crawling the web is a natural monopoly, that Google has control of that monopoly, and that once you understand why this is true and what it means it becomes pretty clear about what sorts of regulations should be taken to reign in Google’s power over the internet. </p>
<p>We have published on this website the economic arguments that we have developed that we think help people understand the foundations of Google and how to regulate<a href="https://knuckleheads.club/understanding-google/"> </a>them. Up until now we have done all this work in private, reaching out to and meeting with regulators on an individual basis. With the publishing of an article about this work in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/technology/how-google-dominates.html">The New York Times</a>, we are publishing this research for everyone to read and opening up the club for people to join and participate in researching Google’s monopoly. We have a <a href="https://knuckleheads.club/whats-next/" data-type="page" data-id="2518">solid plan for the next year</a> about how to finish this research and work with legislators and governments to get legislation drafted and introduced to regulate Google’s web crawling advantages. If you find yourself agreeing with what you read on this website and get caught up imagining a better future where the internet isn’t just five big tech companies all cutting deals with each other, please consider <a href="https://knuckleheads.club/join-the-club/" data-type="page" data-id="2444">joining the Knuckleheads’ Club</a> and helping us fight to win a better world. </p>
<p>So, with all that said as an introduction, let’s dive into what Google is exactly. </p>

<h3>Challenge</h3>



<p>China’s largest retailer, JD.com serves more than 300 million active customers with its e-commerce business. “A few years ago, it became apparent that as our data became more extensive, our MySQL databases became larger, resulting in declining performance and higher operations and maintenance costs,” says JD Retail Chief Architect Haifeng Liu. “We needed a solution that would enable us to easily and quickly scale MySQL, facilitate operation and maintenance, and reduce hardware and labor costs.”</p>



<h3>Solution</h3>



<p>JD chose Vitess for scalable management of large-scale database services and the support of online expansion of complex transactional data in MySQL. “We now run MySQL databases in containerized environments with Kubernetes and use Vitess for scalable cluster management and handling large volumes of complex transactional data,” says Liu.</p>



<h3>Impact</h3>



<p>With Vitess, JD has seen improvements in&nbsp;the scalability and elasticity of the database clusters. Increased resource utilization and efficiency and the automation of operation and maintenance functions have also led to reductions in labor and resource costs.</p>

<h3>China’s largest retailer and the world’s third-largest Internet company by revenue, JD.com serves more than 300 million active customers with its e-commerce business.</h3>



<p>The company also owns China’s largest e-commerce logistics infrastructure, which covers an incredible 99% of the country’s population and has achieved delivery rates of more than 90% of orders delivered same- or next-day.</p>



<p>“A few years ago, it became apparent that as our data became more extensive, our MySQL databases became larger, resulting in declining performance and higher operations and maintenance costs,” says JD Retail Chief Architect Haifeng Liu, who leads the Technological Infrastructure Department responsible for driving innovation in containerized infrastructure and developing the hyperscale, containerized, Kubernetes-based platform that powers all facets of JD’s business. “We needed a solution that would enable us to easily and quickly scale MySQL, facilitate operation and maintenance, and reduce hardware and labor costs.”</p>



<p>The company previously used JProxy, a cobar-based database middleware system for MySQL database management. After a thorough evaluation process, Liu says, “we eventually chose Vitess since it was the most suitable solution to address the biggest challenge we were facing: scalable management of large-scale database services and the support of online expansion of complex transactional data in MySQL. We now run MySQL databases in containerized environments with Kubernetes and use Vitess for scalable cluster management and handling large volumes of complex transactional data.”</p>

<p>Being a very early adopter of Vitess—and with one of the largest and most complex deployments of the technology, to boot—came with some challenges. “The re-sharding process was initially manual, the performance was poor, and the orchestrator could fail in large clusters with more than 5,000 instances,” says Liu.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To make sure that Vitess would work at JD’s scale, Liu’s team made numerous improvements and changes, including bug fixes and new functionalities and features. They have also developed performance optimization and automated management tools for the company’s JDOS Kubernetes platform. Among them:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>JTransfer, an online data synchronization and transmission tool that migrates data from JD’s traditional MySQL databases to the Vitess cluster in real time. All topology information in Vitess is stored in etcd.&nbsp;</li><li>BinLake, a MySQL collection tool for real-time collection of Binlog in Vitess and traditional MySQL database services, and publication of the collected Binlog to the Message Queue (JMQ) service. Integrated with Vitess, “BinLake provides intelligent and highly available binlog collection services in clusters,” says Liu. “If there is resharding or failover in Vitess, Binlake will automatically adjust the database instance of the binlog.”</li><li>Mole, a Vitess management system with a GUI console, which improves Vitess service management. “With Mole, we can easily create, reshard, monitor, and back up Vitess’s keyspaces,” says Liu.</li></ul>



<p>“Most of our improvements have been contributed back to the Vitess code base for other developers in the community to benefit from,” says Liu.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“We eventually chose Vitess since it was the most suitable solution to address the biggest challenge we were facing: scalable management of large-scale database services.”</p><cite>— HAIFENG LIU, CHIEF ARCHITECT AT JD RETAIL</cite></blockquote>



<p>With Vitess, JD has seen improvements in the scalability and elasticity of the database clusters. Increased resource utilization and efficiency and the automation of operation and maintenance functions have also led to reductions in labor and resource costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, “Vitess helped the team grow their technical knowledge and strength in the areas of scalable management and elastic database,” says Liu. “The fact that Vitess is a CNCF project means we can significantly benefit from working with a large number of developers and end users in the most active and fast-growing open source community. With CNCF’s endorsement, Vitess can gain increasing awareness, attract more end users and bring together developers to the project. This is very beneficial for Vitess and its end users, which is important to us.”</p>



<p>Liu and his team are excited about the future of Vitess. In addition to migrating its systems to the newly-released Vitess 3.0 (which Liu calls “a significant improvement”), they’re working on developing some common functions for the latest version and developing a more complete operations and maintenance monitoring system.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“The fact that Vitess is a CNCF project means we can significantly benefit from working with a large number of developers and end users in the most active and fast-growing open source community.”</p><cite>— HAIFENG LIU, CHIEF ARCHITECT AT JD RETAIL</cite></blockquote>



<p>For other organizations considering Vitess, Liu offers this advice: “The most value can be derived from Vitess when it is used in concert with Kubernetes. Before using Vitess, it is imperative to perform more testing and research to determine if Vitess is the right solution for your business, and to better understand what adjustments you might have to make to integrate it with your existing systems.”</p>



<p>For JD, Kubernetes, Vitess, and other cloud native technologies have been a game-changer. “Modern service platforms need to be scalable and extremely efficient and agile,” says Liu. “Cloud native technology is well-suited to handle these ever-changing environments. It offers flexibility, efficiency, scalability, independence, continuous integration and delivery for software services, all of which further enhance the quality of software services and resource efficiency. Kubernetes has become the de facto standard and cloud native is a sure thing to bet on for the future.”</p>

		<p>Well the news is out, I won’t explain the method for reasons, but our code warriors have a new fight. After requesting the SU password, they were told flat out it doesn’t exist and referred to the manual by the vendor. Taking that argument to the telco ombudsman got the same response. If there were one and you wanted to change it for security reasons, it looks like you can’t and with the vendors denying it’s existance, there’s no help coming.</p>
<p>So, the password for the SU account that doesn’t exist…</p>

<h3>Challenge</h3>



<p>Four years ago, <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Square</a> branched out into peer-to-peer transactions via its <a href="https://cash.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cash App</a>. After some steady growth, the app rocketed in popularity in 2016, reaching millions of users over just a few months. But its large monolith of a few hundred thousand lines of code was built on the assumption of one single <a href="https://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MySQL</a> database and wasn’t designed to scale.</p>



<h3>Solution</h3>



<p>To solve the long-term scalability problem, they turned to <a href="https://vitess.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vitess</a>, the open source database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL. “The nice thing is if we solved it once, then we have a piece of infrastructure that would be the cookie-cutter way we would scale out other systems that are built the same way,” says Engineering Manager Jon Tirsen.</p>



<h3>Impact</h3>



<p>The first shard split with Vitess took place in November 2017, and “there was less than a second of downtime, so it was not user visible,” says Tirsen. Nowadays, “it’s completely routine. We did ten shard splits last week.” Looking ahead at Cash App’s continued growth, Tirsen says, “You have to keep on working on it, but Vitess does provide you essentially with near unlimited scale.</p>

<h3>For millions of people, from taxi drivers to market vendors to big businesses, <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Square</a> has made getting paid by credit card much easier since it launched its card reader and mobile app in 2010.</h3>



<p>Four years ago, the company branched out into peer-to-peer transactions via its <a href="https://cash.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cash App</a>. After some steady growth, the app rocketed in popularity in 2016, reaching millions of users over just a few months and landing at the top of the App Store’s most popular downloads.</p>



<p>The only problem? “We had a large monolith of a few hundred thousand lines of code that was built on the assumption of one single MySQL database; it was never really designed to scale from the start,” says Engineering Manager Jon Tirsen. With users increasing by the minute, the company had to dedicate more and more expensive hardware for its database. But that clearly wasn’t a long-term solution, so Tirsen’s team of three was tapped to solve the scalability problem for Cash App. “Because we had the growth trajectory, we really needed to solve it very, very quickly to step up to the challenge of the product side,” he says.</p>



<p>The team’s first pass was trying to pull data out into key value storage that they built on top of MySQL. “It’s an inherently scalable storage platform, but less feature rich,” Tirsen says. Plus, this solution would have required rewriting hundreds of thousands of lines of code and thousands of different queries, and “there was just no way we would have had the time to do it,” he says.</p>

<p>So the team proposed solving sharded MySQL themselves. At the time, addressing the problem in the application rather than in the infrastructure layer was the default way to solve scale at Square, as well as at many other companies like Facebook or Pinterest. The team had begun drawing up plans, when someone else at Square suggested they look at <a href="https://vitess.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vitess</a>, the open source database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL.</p>



<p>The project was still relatively new, but after Tirsen started digging into the code, he realized it would work for Cash App. Vitess met two of the team’s key requirements: infrastructure or platform layer query routing—sending queries to the right database—and online shard splitting without downtime.</p>



<p>Additionally, “the nice thing is if we solved it once, then we have a piece of infrastructure that would be the cookie-cutter way we would scale out other systems that are built the same way,” says Tirsen. “So that was kind of exciting, and it would mean that we didn’t need to completely rebuild our system. We could just make Vitess work, and the system would work. Maybe we had to change 5% of the system rather than 95% of the system.”</p>



<blockquote><p>“You have to keep on working on it, but Vitess does provide you essentially with near unlimited scale.”</p><cite>— JON TIRSEN, ENGINEERING MANAGER AT SQUARE</cite></blockquote>



<p>Tirsen’s team spent about a year making those changes, as well as adapting Vitess to work inside the overall Square infrastructure. To enable an external database to work with Vitess, the team rebuilt a lot of the shard-splitting workflows.</p>



<p>“The biggest thing we did was we changed the way sharding works,” says Tirsen. “Before, Vitess did shard splits by stopping replication, but because we can’t control our external databases, we changed that to instead use MySQL’s built-in support for consistent snapshots, where you can view the database at a fixed point in time, even if the database is still getting updated. Then you can make a copy of the database based on that consistent snapshot.”</p>



<p>That work has been upstreamed, and is now commonly used throughout the Vitess community. “It’s an amazing bonus that we can work together on solving problems across companies that don’t normally have a formal way of working together,” Tirsen says.</p>



<p>Next, the team practiced the shard splits in staging and testing environments—a lot. “You can practice the entire shard split except the last query reroute, where you basically start writing to the new shard, without affecting any production traffic at all,” says Tirsen.</p>



<blockquote><p>“While we were doing these very dramatic changes to our architecture to make it scalable, the feature teams were building incredible features on top of Cash App.”</p><cite>— JON TIRSEN, ENGINEERING MANAGER AT SQUARE</cite></blockquote>



<p>The first shard split with Vitess took place at 5 a.m. ET in November 2017, and “there was less than a second of downtime, so it was not user visible,” says Tirsen. “It was incredibly exciting.” Nowadays, he adds, “it’s completely routine. We did ten shard splits last week.”</p>



<p>Overall, Tirsen says he is proudest of this fact: “We didn’t have to completely change how developers built applications, so while we were doing these very dramatic changes to our architecture to make it scalable, the feature teams were building incredible features on top of Cash App, on top of our platform. So it was like changing the engines of the airplane while it was still in the air flying.” In fact, during that year of work, marquee features like the Cash card were launched.</p>



<p>Looking ahead at Cash App’s continued growth, Tirsen recognizes that solving the problem of scalability will always be a work in progress for his team. They’re currently building a developer platform based on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kubernetes</a>, <a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prometheus</a>, <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Envoy</a>, <a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jaeger</a>, and other CNCF technologies, which Tirsen envisions supporting potentially thousands of developers. “Vitess is going to become part of this essential underlying infrastructure to make sure that everything that we build becomes scalable by default,” he says. “You have to keep on working on it, but Vitess does provide you essentially with near unlimited scale.”</p>

    <p>Recently the team I work with completed a project to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UyDK2bDjc4">allow Shopify to run in
multiple datacenters</a>. This project
was a refactoring project in disguise. When you undertake large refactoring of a
code-base with 100s of developers and 100,000s of lines of code, you can’t align
by sending an email. The merge-conflicts a single pull request would entail
makes me shiver. When deprecating in a large code-base the only way to reliably
avoid new deprecated behaviour is a failing test that tells you what to do.
Otherwise the pace that new deprecated code is introduced can easily outpace the
speed at which you can remove them, or be a massive source of frustration.</p>
<p>Typically deprecations come in the form of soft warnings: Logging to <code>stderr</code>,
capital letters and exclamation marks in the documentation, or a legacy prefix
to the method or class name. At the end of the day, everyone needs to get work
done, and if they see a code-path already being used from 10 places in the
code-base despite these soft warnings–it doesn’t seem crazy to introduce
another. However, if another project is blocked on these deprecated code-paths,
piling on may have a large cost.</p>
<p>To solve this problem <a href="https://twitter.com/fw1729">Florian Weingarten</a> on our
team introduced what he calls “shitlists”: a whitelist of deprecated behaviour.
Existing deprecated behaviour is OK and whitelisted. New usage of the deprecated
API is banned and fails a test with a well-defined error.</p>
<p>They come in many forms, but could look like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>Shitlist</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>ClassA</span>,
  <span>ClassB</span>,
  <span>ClassC</span>
<span>]</span>

<span>def</span> <span>push_job_that_does_crazy_things</span>(klass)
  <span>if</span> <span>Shitlist</span><span>.</span>include?(klass)
    <span># Existing deprecated behaviour is called.</span>
  <span>else</span>
    <span>raise</span> <span>Shitlist</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span>, <span>&lt;&lt;-EOS
</span><span></span><span>You</span><span>'</span>re pushing a job that does crazy things<span>.</span> <span>This</span> <span>API</span> has been 
deprecated <span>in</span> this code<span>-</span>base<span>.</span> <span>&lt;</span>team<span>&gt;</span> is actively trying to get
rid of this code<span>-</span>path, because
<span>&lt;</span>reason<span>&gt;.</span> <span>We</span> suggest you instead <span>do</span> <span>&lt;</span>alternative<span>&gt;.</span> <span>If</span> you have questions, please
ping <span>&lt;</span>team<span>&gt;.</span>
  <span>EOS</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>A shitlist could be something as simple as a <code>git grep</code> for a certain code-path:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>test</span> <span>"no new introductions of legacy code path"</span> <span>do</span>
  actual <span>=</span> <span>`git grep some_legacy_method_with_a_unique_name`</span>
  assert_equal <span>321</span>, actual
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Other times you can reach into another API and get a count or shitlist:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>RedisShitlist</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>Session</span>,
  <span>FragmentCache</span>,
  <span>AuthenticationTokens</span>,
<span>]</span>

<span>test</span> <span>"no new redis models introduced"</span> <span>do</span>
  assert_equal <span>RedisShitlist</span>, <span>RedisModel</span><span>.</span>descendants
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Other ways we’ve used shitlists in the past:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that a certain datastore is only read from in a certain context (or
not used at all). This would allow for using a read-only slave, or improving
resiliency in a certain area.</li>
<li>Ensure fallbacks for all uses of a secondary data-store. E.g. if you access
sessions in Redis and Redis is down, you should be able to still render the
page (i.e. have an empty session fallback).</li>
<li>Shitlisting joins between tables that have no business being joined. This is
helpful to keep data-models and scope clean, or separating a part of an
application.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a linter for a project, you may be able to encode rules. For example
you might use <a href="http://www.foodcritic.io/">Foodcritic</a> for Chef, or
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">Rubocop</a> for Ruby.</p>
<p>Sometimes the shitlist is quite complicated, and much more domain-specific.</p>
<p>Building the shitlist gives the team responsible for it a number of advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Strong feedback loop.</strong> The goal is to reduce the <code>Shitlist</code> to an empty
Array and always raise or remove the code entirely. Remove a class from the
list, fix the code and the tests, celebrate and move on.</li>
<li><strong>Stopped the bleeding.</strong> New deprecated behaviour is not introduced unless
the team is contacted or some other action defined in the error is taken.</li>
<li><strong>Success metric</strong>. If you have shitlists for everything that needs to be
done for your project, you have metrics that you can track. Every week you
can look at how these lists are shrinking. Refactoring for months at a time
can be exhausting, but if you see that you’re making progress with metrics
moving, it’s much more rewarding.</li>
<li><strong>Enforces a guarantee</strong>. For example, you can have a shitlist that all jobs
have a retry mechanism. In that case, you know that you can kill any worker
gracefully at any time since the job will retry. Because of 1-3 you know how
much work it will take to have this guarantee.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important that the shitlist errors are actionable. If you hit the shitlist
of another team, you need to know what to do next. Ideally the error explains
exactly what you need to do, and no humans need to talk, but reaching out to the
owner of the shitlist should always be part of the shitlist.</p>
<p>If you own a shitlist, you must empathize with the problems of everyone who’s
running into problems. If you simply deprecate new behaviour and don’t offer an
alternative, you will be the source of frustration. If the value of emptying the
shitlist far outweighs the value of adding to the shitlist, it may be OK to not
offer a direct other solution but ask the person who ran into the error to
revise their solution.</p>
<p>It is important that people run into shitlists as early in development as
possible. If you run into a shitlist after spending hours implementing your
solution, you will be less than popular. Some shitlists may require an entire
re-architecting of some teams’ solutions.</p>
<p>Months, in our case more than a year, of refactoring can be overwhelming and
unrewarding work. With the strong feedback loop that shitlists introduce you can
see the light at the end of the tunnel. You know that nothing is added to the
shitlist without you knowing about it.</p>
<p>Creating shitlists in some cases can be extremely difficult. Some take hours to
create, others weeks, and in our case one took months to come up with. You’ll
have to place the cost of developing the shitlist against the cost of not having
it. In some cases logging when you hit a bad code-path may be enough (simple
soft warning deprecation) if you assert the risk of new behaviour small and the
complexity of introducing the shitlist big.</p>
<p>Delegating with shitlists is great. Due to the tight feedback loop, asking other
teams or onboarding new team members becomes much easier. Remove something on
the shitlist, fix the code and the tests, then move on. Sometimes during large
refactorings you may need other teams with more domain expertise of a certain
area of the code-base to help. The shitlist becomes a great rock to point people
at.</p>
<p>If you are about to embark on a large refactor, I highly recommend adding
shitlists to your toolbox. Your project will look much less daunting when it
goes from an opaque objective to a list of shitlists.</p>

<p>Few events are as compelling as an epidemic. When sufficiently severe, an epidemic evokes responses from every sector of society, laying bare&nbsp;social and economic fault lines and presenting politicians with fraught medical and moral choices. In the most extreme cases, an epidemic can foment a full-blown political crisis. Thus,&nbsp;Thucydides describes how the repeated visitations of plague to Athens in 430-426 BC&nbsp;provoked widespread social disorder and the breakdown of civic norms.</p>



<p>‘Men, not knowing what was to become of them, became utterly careless of everything, whether sacred or profane,’ writes Thucydides. ‘All the burial rites before in use were entirely upset and… many had recourse to the most shameless sepulchres.’</p>



<p>As the plague progresses, Thucydides describes how Athenians were swept up in a wave of hedonism and lawlessness, threatening the foundations of Athenian democracy: ‘Men now coolly ventured on what they had formerly done in a corner… fear of gods or law of man there was none to restrain them.’</p>



<p>The resulting crisis, Thucydides claimed, undermined Athenians’ faith in the rule of law and the democratic principles that underpinned the Greek city state, paving the way for the installation of a Spartan oligarchy known as the Thirty Tyrants. Even though the Spartans were later ejected, Athens never regained its confidence.</p>



<p>Covid-19 appears to have engendered a similar crisis in our world, the main difference being in scale. Whereas the crisis Thucydides describes was confined to Athens, the coronavirus pandemic has destabilized governments from Brazil to Belarus,&nbsp;not just that of a 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century city-state. The political reckoning has been particularly rapid in the United States, where Donald Trump’s inability or unwillingness to check the spread of the coronavirus was a key factor in his recent election defeat. Now, the lockdowns and social distancing measures look set&nbsp;to&nbsp;plunge the world into the worst economic depression since the 1930s, raising the spectre of further political instability.</p>



<p>Given the wide-ranging&nbsp;social, economic and political impacts of Covid-19, it is natural to assume that the same must have been true of past epidemics and pandemics. But is this the case? Do pandemics really have the historical impacts that are often claimed for them or are these claims simply the product of particular narratives and readings of history? &nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, in&nbsp;numerical terms, the most devastating pandemic of all time was the 1918-19 ‘Spanish influenza’. Coinciding with the end of the First World War, the Spanish flu is estimated to have killed between fifty to one hundred million people worldwide. However, while 1919 was the first year since records began that the death rate exceeded the birth rate, those that survived generally enjoyed longer and healthier lifespans and, in many instances, benefited from higher wages too. Moreover, while the global death toll was immense, in developed industrial countries the mortality rate averaged two percent, meaning the Spanish flu left most of society unaffected. Indeed, the Spanish flu appears to have made little impression on public memory and social institutions, hence its historiographical characterisation as the&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/why-historians-ignored-the-spanish-flu-101950" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘forgotten pandemic’.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-narrating-epidemic-crises">Narrating Epidemic Crises</h2>



<p>A crisis is normally conceived of as an isolated moment in time in which our lives are shattered and plunged into disorder – what the cultural anthropologist Hendrik Vigh has called&nbsp;‘a momentary malformation in the flow of things’.&nbsp;Vigh <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00141840801927509" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">observes that</a> for many people crises are ‘endemic rather than episodic’ and cannot be delineated as an aberrant moment of chaos or a period of decisive change.&nbsp;This is particularly the case for those living at the margins of society for whom crises are ever present. Indeed, social critics such as Naomi Klein argue that instability is baked into the capitalist system, hence the way that&nbsp;in the last few decades<strong>&nbsp;</strong>neoliberal societies have lurched from one financial crisis to another.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, crises have long been regarded as a way of accessing deeper historical truths. As Janet Roitman <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/330/Anti-Crisis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has argued</a> in&nbsp;<em>Anti-Crisis</em>&nbsp;(2013), a crisis ‘marks and generates history’. This is particularly the case for epidemics and pandemics which, unlike other natural disasters such as famines, are not limited to a particular region or moment in time but may come to encompass the whole globe. As the medical anthropologist Christos Lynteris <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/i40144420" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">puts it</a>, disease outbreaks involve a ‘radically different ontological order’, a mode of being that is simultaneously ‘pathological and infectious’. Or to put it another way, one could conceivably outrun a famine but those who try to flee a plague may become unwitting carriers, contaminating new communities and introducing the pathogen to new places.</p>



<p>What is also not widely appreciated is that the roots of the term ‘crisis’ lie in the Ancient Greek word&nbsp;<em>krinô</em>&nbsp;(meaning to separate, choose, cut, decide, judge) and can be traced back to Hippocrates, whose scientific method influenced Thucydides’ approach to history. For the Hippocratic school of medicine, prognosis took precedence over diagnosis, the point being to identify the turning point of a disease in order to intervene and bring about a satisfactory resolution to the illness. Similarly, Thucydides hoped that by tracking the social and moral dissolution that envelopes Athens under the strain of the plague, his history could serve as a ‘great case-book of social pathology’, enabling readers to recognise similar historical patterns in future and intervene so as to restore order and stability. In this way, <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-invention-of-medicine/robin-lane-fox/9780241277058#:~:text=Robin%20Lane%20Fox's%20remarkable%20book,that%20survive%20under%20his%20name." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it has been argued</a>, Thucydides applied a medical template to epidemic crises that has coloured our interpretation of them ever since.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-black-death-and-demographic-change">The Black Death and demographic change</h2>



<p>Perhaps the standout example of the transformative power of disease is the fourteenth century Black Death. Caused by the plague bacillus,&nbsp;<em>Yersinia pestis</em>, the pandemic coincided with the transition from medieval to early modern European society and was greatly enhanced by new shipping networks linking Venice and Genoa with Constantinople, Tunis, London and Bruges. The larger broad-bellied ships required for these long voyages provided perfect conveyances for plague-carrying rats and were soon sparking outbreaks across Europe.</p>



<p>Some scholars claim the pandemic killed a third of Europe’s then population between 1347 and 1353; others say up to one half. Whatever the true mortality there is little doubt the Black Death represented a massive external shock to medieval society and, together with the famines that preceded it, contributed to a declining or stagnant population in Europe for almost 150 years afterwards. The result was a demographic, economic and political crisis.</p>



<p>A smaller population meant less demand for grain putting downward pressure on the price of basic foodstuffs. At the same time, a diminished population fuelled competition, exerting upward pressure on wages and challenging the villeinage system of forced labour that underpinned the feudal system. The result was a wave of popular uprisings across Europe, including the Jacquerie in France in 1358, the revolt of the Florentine&nbsp;<em>Ciompi</em>&nbsp;or wool carders in 1378-82, and the 1381 Peasants’ Revolt in England. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The demands of English peasants included the abolition of an inequitable poll tax and the removal of a statute, passed in the wake of the Black Death, that sought to restrict wages to pre-pandemic levels. The Florentine carders meanwhile demanded a more equitable fiscal policy and the right to establish guilds, fore runners of trade unions. Today, we take collective wage bargaining and trade unions for granted, but in the fourteenth century these demands threatened the basis of the feudal system, hence the observation of the French chronicler Jean Froissart that: ‘Never was any land or realm in such great danger as England at that time.’</p>



<p>This economic levelling also spurred a series of social and cultural changes, including the right of everyone except the lowliest manual worker to wear furs – a privilege that previously had been the preserve of nobles and clerics.&nbsp;In most cases the political reforms were short-lived. For instance,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item126561.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wat Tyler</a>, the leader of the English rebels, marched to London to petition King Richard II with 60,000 peasants at his back. Demanding that ‘all men should be free and of one condition’, the rebels occupied the Tower of London, ransacked the palaces and mansions of wealthy Londoners, and executed the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Lord Chief Justice, as well as other hated representatives of the nobility. Within a few weeks Wat Tyler and other leaders of the revolt had been arrested and executed and the crisis was over. Nonetheless, the movement resulted in concessions to peasants: the poll tax was abandoned, and wage bargaining expanded over time, leading to the emergence of a new yeoman class.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-collapse-of-the-aztec-and-incan-empires">The collapse of the Aztec and Incan empires</h2>



<p>Similar claims&nbsp;have been made about the crisis that enveloped the Aztec and Incan empires following the Spanish Conquest of Central and South America in the early sixteenth century. In&nbsp;<em>Plagues and Peoples</em>, McNeill&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Plagues-People-William-McNeill/dp/0385121229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">argued that</a>&nbsp;‘disaster is to be expected whenever some previously remote and isolated tribe comes into contact with the outside world and there encounters a series of destructive and demoralizing epidemics.’</p>



<p>In the case of the Aztecs and Inca, the&nbsp;root cause of crisis and societal collapse&nbsp;was the introduction by Columbus and, later, the conquistador Hernan Cortez, of smallpox, measles and other Old World diseases to which Amerindian populations of modern-day Mexico, Guatemala and Peru had little or no immunity. The result was that&nbsp;within a century of Cortes’s arrival in the Gulf of Mexico in 1518 the population of Central Mexico had been reduced, according to some estimates, from 25 million to 1.5 million. A similar demographic …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p><span>14 Dec 2020</span></p><p>This article provides practical tips on how to optimize the loading speed of your website. Some advice specifically aims at users of <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, the blog-enabled static site generator. However, the basic ideas also apply to other tools and should therefore be easy to transfer.</p> <p>Note: This is an article written by and for the occasional web developer. If you’re a professional full-time web developer, you might know much of the content. I still encourage you to continue reading, though!</p> <h2 id="why-care">Why Care?</h2> <p>Why should you care about performance? We’ve got tiny supercomputers in our pockets, so who cares? And aren’t static websites such as those generated by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> super fast out of the box? Well, not so fast.</p> <p>Performance matters a lot, and tiny improvements can make a vast difference. According to research from Google, the speed it takes to load a page has an impact of around 75% for user experience, clearly above other criteria such as ease of use or attractiveness:</p> <p><img src="https://www.danielsieger.com/images/speed_impact.jpg" alt="Impact of Speed on UX"></p> <p>If you would like to learn more, have a look at this talk from Google’s 2019 I/O conference:</p> <p> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mLjxXPHuIJo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p> <p>When it comes to static websites the situation surely is not as bad as in other cases. Remember Flash, anyone? However, investigating performance more closely reveals opportunities for optimization even for static sites.</p> <h2 id="performance-analysis">Performance Analysis</h2> <p>First, we need to measure performance before we can optimize it. My current tool of choice is Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">Lighthouse</a>. You can either run it in a browser through <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools">Chrome Dev Tools</a> or online at Google’s <a href="https://web.dev/measure">web.dev</a> pages.</p> <p>Lighthouse not only analyzes raw performance but also provides insight into how well your website performs according to</p> <ul> <li>Accessibility</li> <li>Best practices</li> <li>Search engine optimization</li> </ul> <p>Here’s what I got for an older version of my site using Chrome Dev Tools:</p> <p><img src="https://www.danielsieger.com/images/lighthouse_perf_old.jpg" alt="Performance results on old website"></p> <p>That’s quite a bit of red and orange. In contrast, this is what I get after optimization, using <a href="https://web.dev/measure">web.dev</a> this time:</p> <p><img src="https://www.danielsieger.com/images/lighthouse_perf_results.jpg" alt="Performance results on current website"></p> <p>Read on to see how you might get there as well.</p> <h2 id="minification">Minification</h2> <p>Low-hanging fruits first.</p> <p>A straightforward way to reduce the size of your pages is to minify the HTML code. Just like other text-based formats, HTML can be minified by reducing white space, comments, newlines, or optional closing tags.</p> <p>There is a Jekyll plugin that exactly does that job for you: <a href="https://github.com/penibelst/jekyll-compress-html">jekyll-compress-html</a>. The usage is super simple:</p> <ol> <li>Download the <code>compress.html</code> file from the repository</li> <li>Copy it to the <code>_layouts</code> folder of your Jekyll website</li> <li> <p>Edit your top-level layout file (usually <code>default.html</code>) to have the following front matter:</p>  </li> </ol> <p>This will change your HTML code from something nicely formatted and human-readable to something much more compact. Here is a comparison before and after enabling minification:</p> <p><img src="https://www.danielsieger.com/images/compress_before_after.png" alt="HTML minification example"></p> <p>This saves about 1K in size on a random HTML page of mine. Doesn’t sound too impressive, but Lighthouse already shows some improvement.</p> <h2 id="only-include-what-you-need">Only Include What You Need</h2> <p>From here on things get slightly more complicated, but the gain in speed is also significantly greater. Hang tight.</p> <p>Depending on your Jekyll setup, you eventually include a <em>lot</em> of additional assets like CSS frameworks, JavaScript libraries, or custom fonts. Chances are that you only need a subset of them.</p> <p>I use <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to build this site (see <a href="https://www.danielsieger.com/blog/2019/01/12/creating-jekyll-bootstrap-template.html">this post</a>), which depends on <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. Both libraries are quite heavyweight. Turns out I only need a fraction of them, offering an excellent opportunity for size reduction.</p> <h3 id="bootstrap">Bootstrap</h3> <p>I compile my own version of Bootstrap using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language)">Sass</a>, see this <a href="https://www.danielsieger.com/blog/2019/01/12/creating-jekyll-bootstrap-template.html">post</a> for details. Therefore, I can easily configure which CSS modules to include from the Bootstrap distribution. Here is my top-level <code>bootstrap.scss</code> file with all unused modules commented out:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>@import</span> <span>"functions"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"variables"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"mixins"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"root"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"reboot"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"type"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"images"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"code"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"grid"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"tables"</span><span>;</span>
<span>/* @import "forms"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "buttons"; */</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"transitions"</span><span>;</span>
<span>/* @import "dropdown"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "button-group"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "input-group"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "custom-forms"; */</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"nav"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"navbar"</span><span>;</span>
<span>/* @import "card"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "breadcrumb"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "pagination"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "badge"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "jumbotron"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "alert"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "progress"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "media"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "list-group"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "close"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "toasts"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "modal"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "tooltip"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "popover"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "carousel"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "spinners"; */</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"utilities"</span><span>;</span>
<span>/* @import "print"; */</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>That’s more than half of the modules, and I’m sure I could optimize this even further after more careful investigation.</p> <h3 id="jquery">jQuery</h3> <p>The Bootstrap JavaScript code depends on jQuery, which is quite a heavy library providing a lot of functionality. The good news is: As long as you are only using the CSS part of Bootstrap, you are fine <em>not</em> to include it.</p> <p>Check if you really need the Bootstrap JavaScript modules. If not, just remove the corresponding <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags for both from your template and watch your performance score improving.</p> <p>In my case, I still use jQuery to retrieve comments on blog posts via GitHub, see <a href="https://www.danielsieger.com/blog/2018/10/23/blog-comments-using-github.html">here</a> for details. However, instead of including jQuery by default on all pages, I now only include it on blog posts using the comment functionality:</p> <div><div><pre><code>{% if page.issue and site.github_comments_repository %}
...
<span>&lt;script </span><span>src=</span><span>"/js/jquery.min.js"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
...
{% endif %}
</code></pre></div></div> <p>I admit that it is still overkill include jQuery just to retrieve some data from GitHub. I’m sure there are more lightweight alternatives. Can you recommend one? Leave a comment below!</p> <h3 id="mathjax">MathJax</h3> <p>Many technical blogs include support for <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>, a convenient way to typeset mathematical formulas in your posts. Again, this is quite a heavy dependency pulling in lots of JavaScript code.</p> <p>Similarly, the solution is to use conditional inclusion: Only include MathJax when you really need it. Here, a dedicated front-matter variable in posts needing MathJax support will do the trick:</p> <div><div><pre><code>---
layout: post
title: Fancy Post With Lots of Math
mathjax: true
---
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Next, change your layout or include file (depending on where you actually include MathJax) to check for the variable being defined:</p> <div><div><pre><code>{% if page.mathjax %}
  <span>&lt;script </span><span>type=</span><span>"text/x-mathjax-config"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;!--</span> <span>your</span> <span>config</span> <span>here</span> <span>--&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/script&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;script </span><span>async</span> <span>src=</span><span>"/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
{% endif %}
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Note the <code>async</code> attribute above to enable asynchronous loading of the script. This eventually enhances performance in case you actually use MathJax.</p> <h2 id="deferred-loading">Deferred Loading</h2> <p>As shown above, adding the <code>async</code> attribute to <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags is one way to improve page load time for scripts that you absolutely have to load. Using the <code>defer</code> attribute is another alternative. See the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script">script</a> HTML element documentation for more information.</p> <p>Another commonly used technique is to defer the loading by placing your <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags at the very end of the document. However, you should not need this anymore when using the <code>async</code> or <code>defer</code> attributes.</p> <p>For more information on how to eliminate render-blocking resources, please see the corresponding Google Developers <a href="https://web.dev/render-blocking-resources/">page</a>.</p> <h2 id="inline-critical-css">Inline Critical CSS</h2> <p>Another optimization technique is to <em>inline</em> CSS code directly into the HTML document instead of loading an external script. The key point is to inline only <em>critical</em> CSS styles needed to render the first paint and make the core functionality work.</p> <p>I adopted a simple version of this by using an online critical path CSS <a href="https://jonassebastianohlsson.com/criticalpathcssgenerator/">generator</a>. This takes your website URL and the full CSS code as input and generates a small set of critical CSS styles to include directly in your HTML header.</p> <p>The resulting CSS looks far from being optimal, but for the moment it works fine. I am sure there are better alternatives out there. Maybe you know something that integrates well with Jekyll? Comment below, or drop me a <a href="mailto:dsieger@posteo.de">mail</a>.</p> <h2 id="asynchronous-loading-of-css">Asynchronous Loading of CSS</h2> <p>Another tweak I applied was to defer loading of the full CSS files using a <del>hack</del> creative solution based on the media attribute.</p> <div><div><pre><code> <span>&lt;link</span> <span>rel=</span><span>"stylesheet"</span>
       <span>href=</span><span>"style.css"</span>
       <span>media=</span><span>"print"</span>
       <span>onload=</span><span>"this.media='all'"</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Note that this requires inlining of critical CSS, otherwise you will get ugly “Flashes of Unstyled Content” (FOUC). See the full <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-simplest-way-to-load-css-asynchronously/">description</a> at <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">css-tricks.com</a> for more details.</p> <h2 id="fonts">Fonts</h2> <p>Custom web fonts are popular and available to everyone through services like <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>. However, ask yourself if you really need them.</p> <p>As an alternative, consider using a system font stack relying on fonts already installed on the user’s system. This offers significant performance gains since</p> <ul> <li>there are no font files to transfer and load</li> <li>the browser likely has the fonts cached</li> </ul> <p>All major operating systems include somewhat decent fonts these days, so this really is an alternative. Plus, the system fonts match the look and feel of the operating system, so users are used to it.</p> <p>Here’s one way to use system fonts:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>body</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>font-family</span><span>:</span> <span>-apple-system</span><span>,</span> <span>BlinkMacSystemFont</span><span>,</span> <span>"Segoe UI"</span><span>,</span>
               <span>Roboto</span><span>,</span> <span>Helvetica</span><span>,</span> <span>Arial</span><span>,</span> <span>sans-serif</span><span>,</span>
               <span>"Apple Color Emoji"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Segoe UI Emoji"</span><span>,</span>
               <span>"Segoe UI Symbol"</span><span>;</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>However, if you are like me and want more precise control over the fonts being used, there are some guidelines to do this efficiently:</p> <ul> <li>Host the fonts yourself if possible. This avoids additional connection requests and/or name resolution.</li> <li>Use <code>font-display: swap</code> in the <code>@font-face</code> definition to make sure text remains visible while the browser loads the fonts.</li> <li>Reduce the size of the font files by sub-setting. Only include the glyphs for the languages you are using.</li> <li> <p>Pre-load essential font files by adding appropriate special tags to your header:</p> <div><div><pre><code>  <span>&lt;link</span> <span>rel=</span><span>"preload"</span>
        <span>href=</span><span>"/font.woff2"</span>
        <span>as=</span><span>"font"</span>
        <span>type=</span><span>"font/woff2"</span> <span>crossorigin</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div> </div> </li> </ul> <p>Last remark: Popular icon font sets such as <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a> are quite heavy as well. The latter contains something around 1000 icons (depending on your version), and I doubt you really need all of them. Consider creating a customized version containing only the icons you actually use. …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p>There are two very different state-of-the-art chess engines: <a href="https://stockfishchess.org/">Stockfish</a> and <a href="https://lczero.org/">Leela Chess Zero</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stockfish</strong> searches many more positions (100 000 000 per second) and evaluates them using computationally cheap heuristics. The tree search methodology is a refinement of alpha-beta pruning.</li>
<li><strong>Leela Chess Zero</strong>, a descendant of DeepMind’s AlphaZero, searches much fewer positions (40 000 per second), using a deep convolutional neural network (trained through millions of games of self-play) to evaluate positions. It has a different search methodology, namely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search">Monte Carlo tree search</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The neural network employed by Leela Chess Zero is itself fascinating, using <a href="https://lczero.org/dev/backend/nn/">an architecture</a> similar to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01507.pdf">SE-ResNet</a> image classification model. This residual tower of squeeze-and-excitation layers feeds into separate ‘value’ and ‘policy’ heads, for evaluating the position and deciding what to do next, respectively.</p>
<p>However, I want to talk more about the general strategy of searching much fewer positions and expending more effort on each position. In particular, this major difference between Stockfish and Leela Chess Zero is reflected in two of the <a href="https://catagolue.hatsya.com/software">many search programs</a> used to find spaceships in Conway’s Game of Life and related cellular automata:</p>
<ul>
<li>The program <strong>ntzfind</strong>, originally written by a pseudonymous author ‘zdr’ and enhanced by Matthias Merzenich, Aidan Pierce, and Tom Rokicki, is a depth-first tree search which uses a huge in-memory lookup table to find all possible choices for the next row based on previous rows.</li>
<li>The new program <strong>ikpx2</strong>, adapted from <a href="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/2018/03/11/a-rather-satisfying-winter/">the program I wrote to find the first elementary knightship</a>, is more analogous to Leela Chess Zero in that its search tree is much smaller, but the amount of work done at each node is much greater.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/logo.png" alt="" width="768" height="768" srcset="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/logo.png 768w, https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/logo-300x300.png 300w, https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/logo-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></p>
<p>In particular, ikpx2 uses a SAT solver to perform a deep lookahead to determine whether the current partial spaceship can be fully extended for several* more rows, and is therefore not close to a ‘dead end’. By comparison, ntzfind can only rule out a partial by performing a depth-first traversal of the entire subtree.</p>
<p>*this is configurable, but a typical value is 30.</p>
<p>The SAT solvers used are Armin Biere’s <a href="https://github.com/arminbiere/kissat">kissat</a> and <a href="https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical">CaDiCaL</a>. Kissat is more optimised than CaDiCaL, but doesn’t support incremental solving yet. As such, ikpx2 tries to learn (using basic reinforcement learning, specifically a multi-armed bandit model) which SAT solver is more appropriate for a given task. Theoretically, we could add additional state-of-the-art SAT solvers such as Mate Soos’s <a href="https://www.msoos.org/2020/07/cryptominisat-5-8-0-released/">cryptominisat</a>, and use a more powerful reinforcement learning model (such as a neural network) to evaluate the subproblem and decide which solver to use.</p>
<p>Having this ‘shallow tree with heavy leaves’ means that the current search progress can easily fit entirely within memory. Also, parallelism is easy: we keep a priority queue of tasks (partial spaceships) and have many CPU threads which do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>remove a task from the queue;</li>
<li>solve it using SAT solvers;</li>
<li>communicate the results back to the main orchestrating thread.</li>
</ol>
<p>The results that are sent back to the main orchestrating thread are partials that have been extended (for 30 or so rows). A small initial segment of those rows are added to the in-memory tree as nodes; the remaining rows are not, as otherwise we’d end up with the same full unpruned search tree used by ntzfind and therefore our advantage is completely annihilated.</p>
<p>What happens to the remaining rows? Instead of merely discarding them, we take the entire extended partial and simulate it in the cellular automaton! Sometimes these partials evolve into an object that the main search couldn’t have found: for example, the tail might have a higher period than the rest of the spaceship, or leave a trail of debris behind. This idea seems to have first been explored by Paul Tooke in 2001, before being rediscovered 20 years later in the context of ikpx2.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>One of the early new ikpx2 search results using Paul Tooke’s idea was this partial, which evolves into a period-528 puffer engine:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/p528.gif" alt="" width="536" height="134"></p>
<p>Similarly, here is a novel period-21 spaceship found by John Winston Garth. He ran ikpx2 to look for 2c/7 spaceships; within 3 days of running on 12 CPU threads, it had both rediscovered David Eppstein’s <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Weekender">weekender</a> and found <a href="https://catagolue.hatsya.com/object/xq21_7dfxg88gxfd7zw123u2222u321zzweh1r4w4r1hezssoy6ossz12y821/b3s23/">a wholly new period-21 attachment</a> that clings to its tail:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Doodah.gif" alt="" width="418" height="562"></p>
<p>The user ‘iNoMed’ then discovered that two of these could interact to produce an exhaust that can be perturbed by a nearby weekender to emit a forward-moving glider every 42 generations:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/rake.gif" alt="" width="198" height="250"></p>
<p>Another feature of ikpx2 is its ability to find objects which have different components of different symmetries. Here, for example, is a spaceship with a symmetric head, asymmetric thorax, and symmetric abdomen. The tail is high-period, again having arisen from simulating a partial rather than from direct SAT solving:</p>
<h3><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/symmetry.gif" alt="" width="550" height="120"></h3>
<p>Somewhat disappointingly, ikpx2 has not succeeded in finding any new spaceship velocities in the standard Life rules. I tested it on the same input as the original ikpx used to find Sir Robin; ikpx2 was able to find the same result approximately 50x faster (in terms of core-hours elapsed).</p>
<p>There was a recent near-miss, which would be a (2,1)c/7 spaceship were it not for a single extra cell born in generation 7 (the left configuration, with or without the indicated green triplet, gives rise to the right configuration with the frustrating red tetraplet):</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/almost.png" alt="" width="961" height="321" srcset="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/almost.png 961w, https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/almost-300x100.png 300w, https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/almost-768x257.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 961px) 100vw, 961px"></p>
<p>The existence of near-misses such as this one makes me hopeful that it will eventually find a (2,1)c/7 spaceship given more time.</p>
<h3>Other cellular automata</h3>
<p>Unlike the original version of ikpx, this version is able to search a wide family of related cellular automata. In particular, it extracts the set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine%E2%80%93McCluskey_algorithm">prime implicants</a> from the cellular automaton rule (regarded as a 9-input 1-output boolean function) and uses that to encode the mechanics of the rule into the SAT problems.</p>
<p>In particular, two invocations of ikpx2 were sufficient to find the following growing knightship in the rule Day&amp;Night: one invocation to find the fast (2,1)c/5 frontend which stretches a thick oblique line, and another invocation to find a slower (2,1)c/6 tail which consumes it:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/growing.gif" alt="" width="164" height="341"></p>
<p>Here’s an 11c/22 spaceship in a nonstandard rule found by lemon41625, which is an even better demonstration of the symmetry switching. The discovery consists of odd-symmetric, asymmetric, and even-symmetric components with a high-period exhaust:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lemon_11c22.gif" alt="" width="588" height="116"></p>
<h3>Source code</h3>
<p>The source code for ikpx2 is <a href="https://gitlab.com/apgoucher/ikpx2">open-source</a> (released under an MIT licence) so you can experiment with it yourself. It’s currently x86_64-specific, because it has <a href="https://gitlab.com/apgoucher/apgmera/">apgsearch</a> as a dependency (in order to quickly simulate the partials and examine whether they evolve into anything remotely interesting).</p>

so that once it's built for the first time, we don't need to rebuild it any more. The integrity of <code>bsb -make-world</code> will be broken
when the assumption does not hold.</p><p>In this release, we fix the integrity of <code>bsb -make-world</code> which allows user to change the dependencies.
The fix is well implementend that people who don't do such modifications will not pay for it.</p><p>This is one of the highest desired feature request based on the
<a href="https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/issues/4361#issuecomment-739538789" rel="noopener noreferrer">user feedback</a>, so we will expand a bit here why it is tricky
to implement it without compromising performance.</p><p>In ReScript compilation scheme, dependencies as packages are treated as a blackbox,
changes of dependencies should be <em>transitive</em>. The is due to that we have cross module
optimizations and the binary interface itself is a hash of its dependencies.
So for a package dependency chain: A -&gt; B -&gt; C, if A changes and B does not change, C still needs get rebuilt.
Because the intermediate output of B may still change due to the change of A.
To make things worse, each package comes with an installation process which is a shell script, so re-installation will make the

<p>Modern languages like Python, NodeJS, and Go make it easy to handle
concurrent requests for multiple customers at the same time by using threads or goroutines.</p>

<p>Such services seem very cost effective because one process can handle hundreds or thousands
of tenants. However, this efficiency comes at a hidden, steep price. When language runtime
scheduling breaks down, one tenant can cause an outage for everyone.</p>

<h2 id="concurrency-made-simple">Concurrency made simple</h2>

<p>Go makes it trivial to handle concurrency.</p>

<p>Here is an example from <a href="https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1">A Tour Of Go</a> that
launches two goroutines that work independently of each other:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
	<span>"fmt"</span>
	<span>"time"</span>
)

<span>func</span> <span>say</span>(<span>s</span> <span>string</span>) {
	<span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>; <span>i</span> &lt; <span>5</span>; <span>i</span><span>++</span> {
		<span>time</span>.<span>Sleep</span>(<span>100</span> <span>*</span> <span>time</span>.<span>Millisecond</span>)
		<span>fmt</span>.<span>Println</span>(<span>s</span>)
	}
}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
	<span>go</span> <span>say</span>(<span>"world"</span>)
	<span>say</span>(<span>"hello"</span>)
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The Go runtime makes sure that each goroutine gets its fair share of CPU and memory.
It gives the impression that both run in parallel:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># GOMAXPROCS sets system threads to 1</span>
<span># This sets up the go language runtime to use one system thread across</span>
<span># all goroutines. Removing this setting will introduce some parallelism,</span>
<span># but will not solve the problems described in this article.</span>
$ GOMAXPROCS<span>=</span><span>1</span> go run main.go
world
hello
hello
world
...</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="language-runtimes-and-multi-tenancy">Language Runtimes and Multi-Tenancy</h2>

<p>Let’s implement a sample Go SaaS that fetches the contents of a URL
for multiple tenants in parallel:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
    <span>"fmt"</span>
    <span>"net/http"</span>
    <span>"sync"</span>
)

<span>// fetch in our example performs some SaaS work for a tenant,
</span><span>// in this case it gets the URL contents from the internet
</span><span></span><span>func</span> <span>work</span>(<span>wg</span> <span>*</span><span>sync</span>.<span>WaitGroup</span>, <span>tenant</span> <span>int</span>, <span>url</span> <span>string</span>) {
    <span>defer</span> <span>wg</span>.<span>Done</span>()
    <span>// Don't ignore errors in real code, folks, and close the response body
</span><span></span>    <span>re</span>, <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>url</span>)
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {
        <span>fmt</span>.<span>Printf</span>(<span>"Tenant(%v) error -&gt; -&gt;  %v\n"</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>err</span>)
        <span>return</span>
    }
    <span>defer</span> <span>re</span>.<span>Body</span>.<span>Close</span>()
    <span>fmt</span>.<span>Printf</span>(<span>"Tenant(%v) -&gt; %v\n"</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>re</span>.<span>Status</span>)
}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>// wg waits for a collection of goroutines to finish
</span><span></span>    <span>// https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#WaitGroup
</span><span></span>    <span>wg</span> <span>:=</span> <span>sync</span>.<span>WaitGroup</span>{}
    <span>url</span> <span>:=</span> <span>"http://www.golang.org/"</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>tenant</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>; <span>tenant</span> &lt; <span>3</span>; <span>tenant</span><span>++</span> {

</span><span></span>        <span>go</span> <span>work</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>wg</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>url</span>)
    }
    <span>// wait for all goroutines to finish
</span><span></span>    <span>wg</span>.<span>Wait</span>()
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>My computer runs the program in no time:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ go run simple/main.go 
Tenant<span>(</span>2<span>)</span> -&gt; <span>200</span> OK
Tenant<span>(</span>1<span>)</span> -&gt; <span>200</span> OK
Tenant<span>(</span>0<span>)</span> -&gt; <span>200</span> OK</code></pre></div>
<p>We can imagine that the Go runtime executes the program in the following order:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>goroutine0</span> = <span>call</span> <span>work</span> <span>with</span> <span>args</span>(<span>0</span>, <span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handle0</span> = <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handles</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>handle0</span>, <span>goroutine0</span>)
<span>sleepingGoroutines</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>goroutine0</span>)

<span>goroutine0</span> = <span>call</span> <span>work</span> <span>with</span> <span>args</span>(<span>1</span>, <span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handle1</span> = <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handles</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>handle1</span>, <span>goroutine1</span>)
<span>sleepingGoroutines</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>goroutine1</span>)
<span>...</span>
<span>// main program waits until any function returns data from the internet
</span><span></span><span>handle</span> = <span>epoll</span>(<span>handles</span>)
<span>...</span> 
<span>// Continue execution of goroutine 0
</span><span></span>print(<span>response</span>)
<span>// main program waits until any other handle returns data from the internet
</span><span></span><span>handle</span> = <span>epoll</span>(<span>handles</span>)
<span>// Continue execution of goroutine 0
</span><span></span>print(<span>response</span>)
</code></pre></div>
<p>This parallelism and blocking call is an illusion created by a combination of the use of the asynchronous
<a href="https://kovyrin.net/2006/04/13/epoll-asynchronous-network-programming/">epoll</a> Linux function
and Go’s built in runtime scheduler. <code>epoll</code> can efficiently handle thousands of network sockets at once.</p>

<p>The Go runtime activates a smart scheduler to handle <code>go</code> statements - goroutines.
It makes sure that every goroutine gets its share of CPU time and suspends
execution when the function is waiting on network or file input/output.
It’s not unusual to have tens of thousands of goroutines in the system
and see the Go runtime handle the requests well.</p>

<p>If you are interested in a more detailed intro to the Go scheduler, take a look at this article
from <a href="https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2018/08/scheduling-in-go-part2.html">Ardan Labs</a>.</p>

<p>This makes Go a great language for handling concurrent network requests
that constitute the bulk of an average software as a service program that reads and writes to a database
or an external service.</p>

<h2 id="when-fair-scheduling-breaks-down">When fair scheduling breaks down</h2>

<p>Language runtimes do not have full control and visibility into
the resource allocation that is done by the Linux kernel.</p>

<p>This is where the multi-tenancy service promise of fair scheduling breaks down.</p>

<p>Take a look at this number-crunching service that computes factorials on demand:</p>

}

<p>In this case, you would not observe the same efficient parallelism.</p>

<p>Because of the inefficient factorial implementation that took a lot of iterations
and number crunching, tenant 0 consumed all the CPU time and degraded performance for the others.</p>

<p>We can fix the factorial function and add code that limits the possible input numbers.
However, our service has just suffered an outage due to a bug in the code for all our customers,
<a href="https://goteleport.com/resources/videos/workflow-access-pageduty-slack/">PagerDuty</a> is ringing and we are not sleeping again.</p>

<h2 id="a-real-world-example">A real-world example</h2>

<p>I made up our factorial example, but let’s create a real world one using
decompression bombs.</p>

<p>Decompression bombs are specially crafted archives that are small, but expand
into files ranging from tens to thousands of times their size.</p>

<p>They are specifically designed to take down your service. Anyone can download
one <a href="https://bomb.codes/bombs">from the internet</a>.</p>

<p>Some archives use simple techniques like compressing very large files
filled with zeroes. They take advantage of the fact that compression algorithms
represent a huge file with zeroes with a version of <code>repeat billion zeroes here</code>.</p>

<p>More <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/woot19-paper_fifield_0.pdf">sophisticated approaches</a>
explore compression techniques in depth and craft evil files
that can explode to petabytes of disk space. The danger is real and lots of programs are
vulnerable on the internet right now.</p>

<p>Let’s explore the effect of such archive on a multi-tenant service.
Our new service unpacks the archive and counts the number of words in a file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
	<span>"bufio"</span>
	<span>"bytes"</span>
	<span>"compress/gzip"</span>
	<span>"fmt"</span>
	<span>"io"</span>
	<span>"io/ioutil"</span>
	<span>"log"</span>
	<span>"sync"</span>
	<span>"time"</span>
)

<span>func</span> <span>createArchive</span>() []<span>byte</span> {
	<span>var</span> <span>buf</span> <span>bytes</span>.<span>Buffer</span>
	<span>zw</span> <span>:=</span> <span>gzip</span>.<span>NewWriter</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>buf</span>)

	<span>_</span>, <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>zw</span>.<span>Write</span>([]byte(<span>"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away..."</span>))
	<span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {

<h2 id="resource-isolation-with-cgroups">Resource isolation with cgroups</h2>

<p>The core of the problem is that CPU time is limited. Programming language runtimes lack
the control and context required to efficiently distribute the CPU time per goroutine.</p>

<p>There is no great solution in the modern programming language runtime that solves
this problem once and for all. Some language runtimes, like the <a href="https://hamidreza-s.github.io/erlang/scheduling/real-time/preemptive/migration/2016/02/09/erlang-scheduler-details.html">Erlang</a>
preemptive scheduler provide more isolation and control. Unfortunately, Erlang does not solve
the problem of memory management and its isolation comes with a performance cost.</p>

</section>
<p>I’ve worked in startups my whole career, first as a software engineer, then as a Chief Technology Officer (CTO), and most recently <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/cto-writer">as a founder</a>. In that time, the most common question I get from non-technical founders has been, “How can I find a CTO or technical co-founder?”</p>
<h2 id="what-does-a-startup-cto-do">What Does a Startup CTO Do?</h2>
<p>First, it’s important to understand that <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/roles-of-startup-cto">startup CTOs have a very unique role</a>. They are responsible for <em>everything</em> in the software product from writing code for your MVP to hiring engineers to company-wide security. Being a startup CTO is hard - you’re basically doing 13 jobs at once.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/roles-of-startup-cto"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qmBywUb.jpg" alt="13 responsibilities of a startup CTO"></a></p>
<p>That said, everyone at a startup is doing a lot, so CTOs aren’t really special. My point is that you aren’t <em>just</em> looking for a software engineer or <em>just</em> an engineering manager. You need someone with a hybrid set of hands-on and higher-level thinking skills. The CTO role is a really difficult one to fill.</p>
<p><em>Note: If you’re looking for more reading material, I’ve assembled a list of <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/startup-books">my favorite books for startup founders here</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="tips-for-finding-a-cto">Tips for Finding a CTO</h2>
<p>While it’s difficult, it’s clearly not impossible for non-technical founders to find a CTO.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/work/">my last two startups</a>, I was the first engineering hire, and I know dozens of others technical co-founders and CTOs in Chicago alone. Unfortunately, it’s not as easy as putting together a <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/cto-interview-questions">list of interview questions</a> and posting a job listing. After having conversations with several of my CTO friends, I put this list of tips together for non-technical founders looking to attract a technical co-founder or CTO.</p>
<h3 id="1-hone-your-vision">1. Hone Your Vision</h3>
<p>With rare exceptions, technical co-founders are likely not the visionaries. We tend to be more execution-focused, but we are still attracted to founders who have a strong vision for why their product needs to exist. People who join early stage startups <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/85broads/2013/11/18/the-millennial-startup-revolution/#51b08ce7622d">tend to be idealists</a>. We know the world doesn’t work the way it should, and we want to be out there making it right.</p>
<p>Founders who have a clear vision that is aligned with something their CTO cares about will get a huge leg up.</p>
<h3 id="2-hone-your-business-plan">2. Hone Your Business Plan</h3>
<p>On the other hand, few engineers are going to be sold on vision alone. The biggest mistake I’ve seen startups make is overbuilding before they validated their market. So when founders approach me, one of the first things I ask is, “How are you going to make money?” followed closely behind, “What have you done to prove that this works?”</p>
<p>Consultant <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/coreyhaines/">Corey Haines</a> presents it this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) What’s your business model?</p>
<p>2) What does “traction” mean with respect to that business model?</p>
<p>3) What is your current traction in that context, and how has it grown over the past couple months?</p>
<p>4) What is your plan for accelerating that traction (give the context of the business model)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your technical founder will know the value he or she brings, so you’ve got to prove yours. As the non-technical founder,
the burden is on you to prove that the business model works.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wedrzaz.jpg" alt="A good CTO will ask about your business plan"></p>
<h3 id="3-the-product-is-not-your-biggest-barrier">3. The Product is Not Your Biggest Barrier</h3>
<p>If you had true market validation, investors would pour money into your startup and you could hire
the best tech talent in the world. Unfortunately, a lot of <a href="http://humbledmba.com/please-please-please-stop-asking-how-to-find">non-technical founders think they must have a working app</a> in order to validate their idea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you can’t sell [your idea] without an MVP, what makes you think you can sell it with one? Honestly, the difference is smaller than you’d think.” - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshsymonds/">Josh Symonds</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Get creative: <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/creating-a-tech-startup-without-a-developer">build the MVP yourself</a>, sell a prototype, build a huge email list of interested buyers, or hire a contractor to build your first version.</p>
<p>I joined The Graide Network because the two non-technical founders had built a business generating real revenue off email and spreadsheets. Hustle in the face of not having a product is extremely attractive.</p>
<h3 id="4-technical-talent-is-in-high-demand">4. Technical Talent is in High Demand</h3>
<p>Most software engineers with more than 5 years of experience have little trouble finding a job. The trick here is to narrow your market so that your startup can stand out.</p>
<p>Limit your search to engineers who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Know and trust you personally,</li>
<li>Have founded or been part of a startup before,</li>
<li>Done open source projects in your problem space, or</li>
<li>Work in the industry you’re interested in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most co-founders <a href="https://blog.close.com/the-secret-to-successful-and-lasting-co-founder-relationships/">knew each other long before they started a company together</a>, so it’s unlikely that you’ll find a random person on the internet who shares your vision. Limit your efforts on people who meet specific interest areas and you’re more likely to at least start a conversation.</p>
<h3 id="5-play-the-long-game">5. Play the Long Game</h3>
<p>Once you start having meetings, don’t lead with, “So, do you want to build my startup?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Do ‘this thing’ for equity because you love it” usually means “because <em>I</em> love it” - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/griffincaprio/">Griffin Caprio</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Start small, ask their advice, get to know them. Ask for introductions, mention that you’re keeping an eye out for a technical co-founder, but remember, your business shouldn’t depend on it. Tell them about the success you’re having, the challenges your facing, and see what gets them excited.</p>
<p>End every meeting asking if there are other engineers you could talk to who might know about your startup’s problem space.</p>
<h3 id="6-put-skin-in-the-game">6. Put Skin in the Game</h3>
<p>By taking a job with a startup, an engineer is forgoing most of their guaranteed salary in exchange for a piece of a fledgling company. <strong>Level the playing field by putting your money into the business.</strong></p>
<p>$50,000 might not pay a full-time engineer’s salary in many places in the United States, but it might be enough to attract a CTO to moonlight for you. If you can’t get that kind of money together, make pre-sales, borrow money, or raise money. You’re unlikely to find a technical co-founder who will work for free from day one.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SIkXBf3.jpg" alt="Put skin in the game"></p>
<h3 id="7-success-attracts-talent">7. Success Attracts Talent</h3>
<p>Finally, <strong>keep moving forward</strong>.</p>
<p>Never use your lack of technical skill as a reason not to move your startup forward. The longer you stick with it, the more you’ll learn, and the more likely you are to find a level of success that becomes attractive to a technical co-founder.</p>
<p>Whether you measure your startup’s success by fundraising, revenue, or users, find a way to move your key metrics forward until your future CTO can’t ignore you.</p>

Delivery.</p><p><a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf#page=21" target="_blank"><strong>The best teams deliver</strong></a><strong>. The worst teams don't.</strong></p><p>The best teams take calculated efforts to improve delivery while the worst are content maintaining the status quo.</p><p>The worst teams hide behind technical debt, execs that 'don't understand', or fairy tales like 'our product is unique' and 'our teams work differently'.</p><p>But the reality is these are just excuses (<a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf#page=32" target="_blank">with very few exceptions</a>).</p><p>‍</p><h2>Why does delivery matter?</h2><p>‍</p><h3><strong>1)&nbsp;Delivery affects the entire business.</strong></h3><p>Studies show <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2018.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">engineering success is highly correlated company success</a> across profitability, market share, and customer satisfaction. This is further backed by Marc Andreessen who states: </p><p><a href="https://a16z.com/2014/06/03/pmarca-tweetstorm-cycle-time-determines-winners-and-losers-in-tech/" target="_blank"><strong>"Cycle Time (delivery speed)&nbsp;compression determines winners &amp; losers in tech".</strong><br></a></p><p>Which makes sense because better delivery brings more value to customers, which in turn brings more revenue. Faster delivery means faster experimentation, value to customers, and gets you faster feedback so you don't waste time building the wrong thing.</p><p>Of course there are things like quality, stability, etc but it all equates back to delivery.</p><p>‍<strong>Deploying quality code, quickly.</strong></p><p>‍</p><h3>2)&nbsp;Developers like to deliver.</h3><p><a href="https://www.devopsgroup.com/blog/why-change-deployment-frequency-results-in-big-gains/" target="_blank"><strong>Developers who deploy more tend to be happier</strong></a><strong>, more productive.</strong></p><p>Which makes sense when you think about a team who struggles with tech debt, complex workloads, unplanned tickets, context switching.</p><p>They aren't able to deliver.</p><p>And that sucks.</p><p>Meanwhile, the team who focuses on delivery invests in removing bottlenecks. Getting their team back to doing what they love - deploying value to customers.</p><p>‍</p><h3>3)&nbsp;It's a fundamental outcome for success.</h3><p><strong>If you're not focused on delivering, then what are you focused on?</strong></p><p>Now you may say 'I don't care about delivery', which fine. But that's like a company saying 'we don't care about revenue'. Sure, you can get away with it but you'll end up in a really bad spot if you don't know your fundamentals.</p><p>At the end of the day, if you focus on delivery then everything else (tech debt, process changes, resourcing) will fall right into place.</p><p>‍</p><h2>How well does your team deliver?</h2><p><a href="https://www.usehaystack.io/create-account" target="_blank">Sign up</a> for Haystack and see how your delivery stacks up.

		<span>As </span><span><a href="https://thingamagig.com/story.html">you may recall</a></span><span>, this entire project began from a desire to add extreme automation to the at-home guitar playing experience - the ability to quickly and easily play famous covers without all the friction of amps, pedals, knobs, switches and presets.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span>What’s the main innovation? </span><span>Thingamagig knows the musical composition itself.</span><span>&nbsp;Thus, during playback, it can manipulate and automate:</span>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span>tones, crafted by a studio engineer and loaded from a central repository</span></li>
		<li><span>effects and loopers</span></li>
		<li><span>tempo, key and mix</span></li>
		<li><span>lyrics/chords (scrolling on screen in perfect time)</span></li>
		<li><span>external MI (guitars, vocal effects, etc)</span></li>
		<li><span>and especially </span><span><a href="https://youtu.be/OEPoqMXZWQI">coordinated lighting as seen in this prototype video</a></span></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<span>While </span><span>the last two bullets didn't make the MVP cut due to cost and complexity, the first 4 did, and combined with an Alexa interface (instant song call-up and guitarists’ hands are usually busy), I’m proud of the result. I love to play it and believe other people will, too. </span>

December 14, 2020 | https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2020-12-12-raft-liveness-full-omission/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2020-12-12-raft-liveness-full-omission/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>Last month, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-byzantine-failure-in-the-real-world/">Cloudflare published a postmortem</a> of a recent 6-hour outage caused by a partial switch failure which left <a href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a> unavailable as it was unable to establish a stable leader. This outage has understandably led to <a href="https://twitter.com/heidiann360/status/1332711011451867139">discussion online</a> about exactly what liveness guarantees are provided by the <a href="https://raft.github.io/">Raft</a> consensus algorithm in the face of network failures.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">original Raft paper</a> makes the following claim:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[Consensus algorithms] are fully functional (available) as long as any majority of the servers are operational and can communicate with each other and with clients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement implies that consensus algorithms such as Raft should tolerate network failures (also known as <a href="https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-06-07-modeling-the-adversary/">omission faults</a>) as long as they do not impact communication between the majority of servers.
In this post, we will consider whether Raft can guarantee liveness, and specifically whether it can establish a stable leader, if a network fault means that some servers are no longer connected to each other.</p>

<h2 id="does-raft-guarantee-liveness-in-the-presence-of-network-failures">Does Raft guarantee liveness in the presence of network failures?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, Raft, as described in the original paper, does not guarantee liveness in all such cases. Consider the following example.</p>

<p>We have 5 servers and servers 1, 2, and 3 are connected to each other. Server 4 is only connected to server 2 and server 5 is only connected to server 3. Initially, server 3 is the leader. Server 4 is not connected to the leader so it will timeout, increment its term and send a RequestVote RPC to server 2. Server 2 will update its term and then force server 3 to do the same and thus step down. Eventually, a new leader will be elected (either server 1, 2, or 3) but either server 4 or server 5 (or both) will not be connected to the leader and thus will timeout, updating its term and forcing the leader to step down. This system will not be able to establish a stable leader.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/uploads/RAFT%201.jpg" width="80%">
  <figcaption><center>Partially connected servers 4 and 5 constantly interrupt the elected leader.</center></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In order to guarantee liveness, Raft must ensure that if a leader is up and connected to a majority of responding servers then it will not be forced to step down. Fortunately, section 9.6 of <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/OngaroPhD.pdf">Diego Ongaro’s thesis</a> suggests how this can be achieved using <strong>PreVote</strong>. PreVote requires potential candidates to run a trial election to test if they can win an election before incrementing their term and running a normal election using RequestVote. A server only pre-votes for a potential candidate during the PreVote phase if it would vote for it during a normal election, and importantly, if it has not received an AppendEntries RPC from the leader with in the election timeout. PreVote fixes the problem have we described as servers 4 and 5 will not update their terms as they will not receive pre-votes from the majority of servers.</p>

<p>An alternative fix is to require servers to ignore RequestVote RPCs if they have received an AppendEntries RPC from the leader within the election timeout. This was suggested in section 6 in the <a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">Raft paper</a> as mitigation for liveness issues during reconfiguration. However, we will focus on PreVote instead.</p>

<h2 id="so-does-raft-with-prevote-guarantee-liveness-then">So, does Raft with PreVote guarantee liveness then?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately not. In fact, PreVote introduces new liveness issues to Raft. Consider the following example. We have 5 servers and servers 1, 2, and 3 are connected to each other. Server 4 is connected only to server 2 and server 5 has failed.</p>

<p>Initially, server 4 is the leader. It was elected before its links to the other servers (except server 2) failed. Server 4 is now unable to make progress as it is not connected to a majority of servers. Servers 1 and 3 will not hear from the leader so they will timeout and begin the PreVote phase. Neither server will complete its PreVote phase as server 2 will not pre-vote for either server as it still receives regular AppendEntries from the leader (server 4). This system will not able to elect a new leader and the old leader will not be able to make progress.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/uploads/RAFT%202.jpg" width="80%">
  <figcaption><center>The leader, Server 4, suffers partial network faults but does not step down. Server 2 does not timeout, severs 1 and 3 will fail PreVote because of server 2.</center></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This can be addressed by requiring leaders to actively step down if they do not receive AppendEntries responses from a majority of servers. This optimisation is sometimes referred to as CheckQuourm and related matters are mentioned in section 6.2 of <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/OngaroPhD.pdf">Ongaro’s thesis</a> and in <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/3866">raft discussions</a>.</p>

<h2 id="does-raft-with-prevote-and-checkquorum-guarantee-liveness">Does Raft with PreVote and CheckQuorum guarantee liveness?</h2>

<p>Yes. If there is no leader, then an election (or series of elections) will occur and eventually, a server will be elected leader. To be elected leader, the server must be connected to a majority of servers as it received votes from a majority of servers in the PreVote and RequestVote phases.</p>

<p>CheckQuorum ensures that if the elected leader is no longer connected to a majority of responding servers, it will step down and allow a new leader to be elected.</p>

<p>There will always be at least one server that can win an election. This is the server (or servers) with the most up-to-date log (logs) within the subset of servers which are all online and connected to a majority of responding servers. PreVote ensures that once a leader from this set has been elected, the system will be stable as it will not be forced to step down.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                  <article>
                    
                  <p><img src="https://chaordic-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/images/lambda-k8s.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Serverless or Kubernetes? The <em>“TL;DR”</em> answer to the question is, <em>“it depends”</em>. The longer answer is, it depends on a number of factors, which we will try to address in this article.</p>
<h4 id="why-not-just-on-premise-bare-metal-or-vm-servers">Why not just on-premise, bare-metal or VM servers?</h4>
<p>If your organisation is just running a single monolithic legacy application built by a single team, there is probably nothing wrong with bare-metal or VM’s. Many teams will invoke this rationale for keeping the Status Quo. But, unless you work for a small, single product company with just one small development team, this is likely not valid.</p>
<p>Most organisations will have more than one team, more than one piece of software that they deploy. The rationale of a single team or multiple isolated teams should therefore not dictate what makes sense for the entire organisation. If you have multiple teams or multiple applications/services, moving to either Serverless or Kubernetes will start to make sense for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standardising deployment technology (lowers development cost).</li>
<li>Automating infrastructure management (lowers operational cost).</li>
<li>Shifting operational work to service providers (such as AWS, Google or Azure, further lowering operational costs &amp; risks).</li>
<li>Shifting capital expenditure to operational expenditure (pay-as-you-go vs upfront investment).</li>
<li>Improved resource utilisation by not paying for idle servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two additional considerations when shifting from “legacy” models of working. Firstly, there will be some retraining of internal staff on-the-job. Any change in technology requires up-skilling. The other side of this is recruitment should become easier: as you standardise on technologies that are widely used in the market, the pool from which you can draw skilled individuals become bigger. And it naturally follows that onboarding new employees becomes cheaper and faster.</p>
<h4 id="when-should-we-use-serverless-instead-of-kubernetes">When should we use Serverless instead of Kubernetes?</h4>
<p>We will preface our recommendation here with this:</p>
<p>We would suggest using Serverless in every use-case, which does not strictly fit the criteria of using something else. When circumstances do not push us strongly away from Serverless, as described in the Kubernetes section, we believe the benefits heavily outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
<p>We would also state that this recommendation specifically holds true for the Amazon Web Services flavour of Serverless. While Azure and Google Cloud also have Serverless offerings as of this being written in late 2020, the AWS offering has a higher level of maturity, combined with the breadth of functionality to implement almost any kind of system imaginable.</p>
<p>We see five specific motivations making Serverless a good option:</p>
<h5 id="time-to-market-is-a-priority">Time-to-market is a priority</h5>
<p>You want to enable developers to iterate quickly and focus on putting new and improved functionality in front of users without being constrained by access to environments or infrastructure. Once past the initial learning curve, the productivity of a FaaS approach is quite impressive. Further, if you follow our <a href="https://chaordic.io/blog/serverless-distributed-system-productivity/">five practices for Serverless productivity</a>, the cycle from code change to change deployed in an environment can be near instantaneous.</p>
<h5 id="you-want-to-shift-operational-effort-to-enabling-business-innovation">You want to shift operational effort to enabling business innovation</h5>
<p>Good DevOps skills are hard to come by. Serverless does not eliminate the need for it either. We still need these skills for CI/CD automation, observability, security and setting system constraints. But since we no longer need to babysit resources such as disks, servers or networks, the effort is significantly reduced. This allows us to better put to use the skills and people we already have - their efforts will be shifted from fire-fighting and operations to enabling business &amp; developer productivity.</p>
<h5 id="your-use-case-translates-well-to-being-implemented-using-faas--an-event-driven-approach">Your use-case translates well to being implemented using FaaS &amp; an event-driven approach</h5>
<p>An absolute pre-requisite is that your system can be implemented with stateless functions with an event-driven approach. Outside of a small number of use-cases, this should generally not be a problem for any modern system.</p>
<h5 id="you-prefer-operational-cost-scaling-with-use--utility-0-use--0-cost">You prefer operational cost scaling with use &amp; utility: 0 use = $0 cost</h5>
<p>Especially for startups and new products in established companies, the near 0 cost of unused Serverless code is very appealing. No need to sweat about wasting money on running infrastructure for code that may not be used, nor if there is a sudden surge in popularity.</p>
<h5 id="your-system-has-an-unpredictable-load-profile">Your system has an unpredictable load profile</h5>
<p>Capacity planning is difficult and either takes great effort, or devolves to guesswork. Serverless removes 90% of the need for this.</p>
<p>The elastic scaling means we primarily need to concern ourselves with the provisioned quotas of our system for the various services we use. While still technically capacity planning, and not quite the “unlimited scalability” promised by some Serverless proponents, it is very close. Some educated guesses and back-of-the-envelope calculations will ensure you have the right quotas set. This is much easier than trying to size Kubernetes clusters correctly with number of nodes, node sizing, disks etc, not to mention that you still won’t pay much at all for any excess capacity you may have provisioned.</p>
<p>With near infinite elastic scaling and close to 0 overhead cost, you can sleep easier at night.</p>
<h4 id="when-should-we-use-kubernetes-instead-of-serverless">When should we use Kubernetes instead of Serverless?</h4>
<h5 id="you-are-building-stateful-components">You are building stateful components</h5>
<p>If your system is made up of stateful components, for instance in-memory caches and other type of services that rely on some internal state, they are unsuitable to be built as Serverless functions. FaaS requires a heavy emphasis on stateless services/functions.</p>
<h5 id="you-have-long-running-tasks">You have long running tasks</h5>
<p>AWS lambda has an upper limit of 15 minutes runtime, after that a function will be terminated whether it is done or not. If you have long running batch-job type tasks, Serverless may be entirely unsuitable. Likewise, even if it is possible to break down a job into smaller parts that fit within the constraints, the data-transport cost (in time, and money) may exceed any benefit from running Serverless.</p>
<h5 id="your-system-has-real-time-or-low-latency-requirements">Your system has real-time or low-latency requirements</h5>
<p>You do not have control of the infrastructure, the precise resource allocation provided, or even concurrency in a Serverless model. If your system has real-time, or very low-latency requirements, non-Serverless solutions are preferable. Many are likely going to say <em>“we want low latency!"</em>, but this does not automatically mean Serverless is unsuitable. Serverless can be very fast, but, if consistent &lt;50ms response times for API’s are business critical, Serverless is not suitable. There are however very few cases in real life where &lt;50ms response times are crucial, and I’d venture a guess in many existing systems, those sort of response times are also the exception rather than the norm. As a side note, if requirements are truly real-time, this is an indicator your system may be more suited for running on bare-metal.</p>
<h5 id="for-existing-systems-which-are-not-easily-migrated-to-serverless">For existing systems, which are not easily migrated to Serverless</h5>
<p>It is often easier to “lift-and-shift” systems in their entirety by putting them in Docker containers. If a service is truly stateless, it may be possible to work around this particular issue by the use of so called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)">“shims”</a>, which wrap the API’s of the libraries the existing system uses. Shims may be useful even with Greenfield Serverless projects, in order to reduce vendor lock-in and keep the target runtime flexible.</p>
<p>Existing systems that are not easily migrated, are highly likely to fit one of the previous three criteria mentioned.</p>
<h5 id="your-system-has-even-predictable--high-load-over-time">Your system has even, predictable &amp; high load over time</h5>
<p>While Serverless gives you the ability for elastic scaling and costs that scale with the utility of the system, it is not necessarily cheaper under all circumstances. If you have a high and predictably even load 24/7/365, running on Kubernetes or traditional infrastructure may actually be cheaper.</p>
<p>If we inspect the concept of “even” load, we quickly notice that this is actually rarely the case with most systems. Business applications have peaks during office hours. eCommerce might peak during busy holiday periods. Trading system loads are highly coupled to trading hours, with open and close particularly peaky. Finally, it may turn out the direct cost of Serverless is higher than Kubernetes, but this may still be offset by lower operational costs in human effort.</p>
<h4 id="what-about-vendor-lock-in">What about vendor lock-in?</h4>
<p>We have made a pretty firm recommendation on AWS Serverless, IF you decide to go Serverless. But what about vendor lock-in? Is this not a genuine concern?</p>
<p>Yes, but one that is often overblown. Firstly, as we mentioned, the lock-in can be reduced with the use of shims. Your application code should not be littered with AWS libraries. Ideally references to AWS code should be isolated behind shim/facade libraries. The availability of open source shims for many popular languages and libraries is also growing.</p>
<p>Secondly, vendor lock-in is everywhere we look in IT: If you use Java or the JVM, you are tied to the future whims of Oracle. If you use Golang, it’s Google. If you choose Kubernetes, Google, Red Hat and a few other vendors have an outsized influence. Whether you pay those vendors or not, there is a web of vendor lock-in around almost every IT decision you have ever made.</p>
<p>Furthermore, given competition in the space, what you pay today is likely the most you will ever pay. With Azure, GCP and other breathing down the neck of AWS, they are in no position to indiscriminately hike prices. If they do, someone else will swoop in and eat their lunch. AWS are under more competitive pressure in 2020 than they were in 2010. It is unlikely to ease anytime soon. The pressures of commoditisation are real.</p>
<h4 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h4>
<p>As we have mentioned in a <a href="https://chaordic.io/blog/from-punch-cards-to-serverless/">previous post</a>, we believe Serverless &amp; Kubernetes will live side-by-side in the future, with the lines blurring over time.</p>
<p>Things change quickly: in 2018, AWS Serverless was not yet ready for prime-time other …</p></article></div></div>

<p><em>As companies increasingly leverage data to power digital products, drive decision making, and fuel innovation, understanding the health and reliability of these most critical assets is fundamental. For decades, organizations have relied on data catalogs to power data governance. But is that enough?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/debashis1saha" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Debashis Saha</em></a><em>, VP, Engineering at AppZen, formerly at eBay and Intuit, and </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/barrmoses" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Barr Moses</em></a><em>, CEO and Co-founder of Monte Carlo, discuss why data catalogs aren’t meeting the needs of the modern data stack, and how a new approach – data discovery – is needed to better facilitate metadata management and data reliability.</em> </p>



<p><em><strong>Interested in learning more about Monte Carlo’s approach to data catalogs and metadata management? <a aria-label="Request a demo (opens in a new tab)" href="https://marketing417822.typeform.com/to/D11gk1a6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Request a demo</a>.</strong></em></p>



<p>It’s no secret: knowing where your data lives and who has access to it is fundamental to understanding its impact on your business. In fact, when it comes to building <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/how-to-build-your-data-platform-like-a-product/">a successful data platform</a>, it’s critical that your data is both organized and centralized, while also easily discoverable.</p>



<p>Analogous to a physical library catalog, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data catalogs</a> serve as an inventory of metadata and give users the information necessary to evaluate data accessibility, health, and location. In our age of <a href="https://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/definition/self-service-business-intelligence-BI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-service business intelligence</a>, data catalogs have also emerged as a powerful tool for data management and data governance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, for most data leaders, one of their first imperatives is to build a data catalog.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the bare minimum, a data catalog should answer:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Where should I look for my data?&nbsp;</li><li>Does this data matter?&nbsp;</li><li>What does this data represent?</li><li>Is this data relevant and important?&nbsp;</li><li>How can I use this data?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Still, as data operations mature and data pipelines become increasingly complex, traditional data catalogs often fall short of meeting these requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s why some of the best data engineering teams are innovating their approach to metadata management – and what they’re doing instead:</p>



<h3>Where data catalogs fall short</h3>



<p>While data catalogs have the ability to document data, the fundamental challenge of allowing users to “discover” and glean meaningful, real-time insights about the health of your data has largely remained unsolved.</p>



<p>Data catalogs as we know them are unable to keep pace with this new reality for three primary reasons: (1) lack of automation, (2) inability to scale with the growth and diversity of your data stack, and (3) their undistributed format.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Increased need for automation</h4>



<p>Traditional data catalogs and governance methodologies typically rely on data teams to do the heavy lifting of manual data entry, holding them responsible for updating the catalog as data assets evolve. This approach is not only time-intensive, but requires significant manual toil that could otherwise be automated, freeing time up for data engineers and analysts to focus on projects that actually move the needle.</p>



<p>As a data professional, understanding the state of your data is a constant battle and speaks to the need for greater, more customized automation. Perhaps this scenario rings a bell:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before stakeholder meetings, do you often find yourself frantically pinging Slack channels to figure out what data sets feed a specific report or model you are using – and why on earth the data stopped arriving last week? To cope with this, do you and your team huddle together in a room and start whiteboarding all of the various connections upstream and downstream for a specific key report?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ll spare you the gory details, but it probably looked something like this:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ph5m59aRfL8owiafVZisgcTG1f0-zrOXWZObUv243HS9i3Gb1uSXXEv9bWOmROiTV8cL2GhNivW5hk8P9SQG3v6NploRM15l7f9s5R6xfbIBxAjPvHCLteV65jQqhhOcT8aXDD0Z" alt="" width="800" height="497"><figcaption><em>Does your data lineage look like a storm of lines and arrows? That makes two (hundred) of us. Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shutterstock</a>.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If this hits home, you’re not alone. Many companies that need to solve this dependency jigsaw puzzle embark on a multi-year process to manually map out all their data assets. Some are able to dedicate resources to build short-term hacks or even in-house tools that allow them to search and explore their data. Even if it gets you to the end goal, this poses a heavy burden on the data organization, costing your data engineering team time and money that could have been spent on other things, like product development or actually using the data.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Ability to scale as data changes</h4>



<p>Data catalogs work well when data is structured, but in 2020, that’s not always the case. As machine-generated data increases and companies invest in ML initiatives, unstructured data is becoming more and more common, accounting for <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3406806/ai-unleashes-the-power-of-unstructured-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 90 percent of all new data produced</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-your-data-platform-choosing-a-cloud-data-warehouse-3de66862f41c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Typically stored in data lakes</a>, unstructured data does not have a predefined model and must go through multiple transformations to be usable and useful. Unstructured data is very dynamic, with its shape, source, and meaning changing all the time as it goes through various phases of processing, including transformation, modeling, and aggregation. What we do with this unstructured data (i.e., transform, model, aggregate, and visualize it), makes it much more difficult to catalog in its “desired state.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>On top of this, rather than simply <em>describing</em> the data that consumers access and use, there’s a growing need to also <em>understand</em> the data based on its intention and purpose. How a producer of data might describe an asset would be very different from how a consumer of this data understands its function, and even between one consumer of data to another there might be a vast difference in terms of understanding the meaning ascribed to the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, a data set pulled from Salesforce has a completely different meaning to a data engineer than it would to someone on the sales team. While the engineer would understand what “DW_7_V3” means, the sales team would be scratching their heads, trying to determine if said data set correlated to their “Revenue Forecasts 2021” dashboard in Salesforce. And the list goes on.</p>



<p>Static data descriptions are limited by nature. In 2021, we must accept and adapt to these new and evolving dynamics to truly understand the data.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Data is distributed; catalogs are not&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Despite the distribution of the modern data architecture (see: <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-a-data-mesh-and-how-not-to-mesh-it-up-210710bb41e0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the data mesh</a>) and the move towards embracing semi-structured and unstructured data as the norm, most data catalogs still treat data like a one-dimensional entity. As data is aggregated and transformed, it flows through different elements of the data stack, making it nearly impossible to document.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image3.png" alt="" width="623" height="482" srcset="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image3.png 623w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image3-300x232.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px"><figcaption><em>Traditional data catalogs manage metadata (data about your data) at the ingest state, but data is constantly changing, making it hard to understand the health of your data as it evolves in the pipeline.

<p>Nowadays, data tends to be <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/self-describing-messages#:~:text=A%20message%20that%20contains%20data,consists%20of%20tag%2Fvalue%20pairs." target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-describing</a>, containing both the data and the metadata that describes the format and meaning of that data in a single package.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since traditional data catalogs are not distributed, it’s near to impossible to use as a central source of truth about your data. This problem will only grow as data becomes more accessible to a wider variety of users, from BI analysts to operations teams, and the pipelines powering ML, operations, and analytics become increasingly complex.</p>



<p>A modern data catalog needs to federate the meaning of data across these domains. Data teams need to be able to understand how these data domains relate to each other and what aspects of the aggregate view are important. They need a centralized way to answer these distributed questions as a whole – in other words, a distributed, federated data catalog.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investing in the right approach to building a data catalog from the outset will allow you to build a better data platform that helps your team democratize and easily explore data, allowing you to keep tabs on important data assets and harness their full potential.</p>



<h3>Data Catalog 2.0 = Data Discovery</h3>



<p>Data catalogs work well when you have rigid models, but as data pipelines grow increasingly complex and unstructured data becomes the golden standard, our understanding of this data (what it does, who uses it, how it’s used, etc.) does not reflect reality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe that next generation catalogs will have the capabilities to learn, understand, and infer the data, enabling users to leverage its insights in a self-service manner. But how do we get there?&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image5.png" alt="" width="624" height="486" srcset="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image5.png 624w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image5-300x234.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px"><figcaption><em>Data discovery can replace the modern data catalog by providing distributed, real-time insights about data across different domains, all while abiding by a central set of governance standards.&nbsp;</em> Image courtesy of Barr Moses.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In addition to cataloging data, metadata and data management strategies must also incorporate data discovery, a new approach to understanding the health of your distributed data assets in real-time. Borrowing from the distributed domain-oriented architecture proposed by Zhamak Deghani and Thoughtworks’ <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>data mesh model</strong>,</a> data discovery posits that different data owners are held accountable for their data as products, as well as for facilitating communication between distributed data across different locations. Once data has been served to and transformed by a given domain, the domain data owners can leverage the data for their operational or analytic needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data discovery replaces the need for a data catalog by providing a domain-specific, dynamic understanding of your data based on how it’s being ingested, stored, aggregated, and used by a set of specific consumers. As with a data catalog, governance standards and tooling are federated across these domains (allowing for greater accessibility and interoperability), but unlike a data catalog, data discovery surfaces a real-time understanding of the data’s current state as opposed to it’s ideal or “cataloged” state.</p>



<p>Data discovery can answer these questions not just for the data’s ideal state but for the current state of the data across each domain:&nbsp;</p>

  <p><span>15 Nov 2020</span></p><p>This post is a reflection on being part of making a maturing infrastructure organization for nearly five years.</p>

<p>When I joined Production Engineering at Shopify, it was barely 30 people. We went for a team dinner around that time and I remember how my manager paid for it with his credit card because points. Now we are at &gt;200 people, and at the last pre-pandemic offsite we had a huge ballroom booked for the dinner. Clearly it wasn’t billed to an individual’s credit card.</p>

<p>Through my there years there, I’ve seen how we’ve solved scalability and growth by introducing boundaries and new levels of abstraction.</p>

<p>Now that I’m noticing this pattern at other companies too, I believe that managing layers of abstraction is the key tool to solving scalability problems.</p>

<h2 id="the-story-of-scaling-redis">The story of scaling Redis</h2>

<p>As the most of other Ruby on Rails shops, we’ve been running job queues on Redis with the <a href="https://github.com/resque/resque" target="_blank">Resque</a> gem (you might have also worked with Sidekiq which is Resque’s successor). Both of those libraries are built on top of Redis, a key-value database written in C that also provides primitives like List and Hash. As a database, Redis keeps those lists/queues in memory for you, and dumps them to the disk every once in a while if you have persistence enabled.</p>

<p>The way how Resque (or Sidekiq) API is designed, you can grab Redis client by calling <code>Resque.redis</code> and query that Redis directly for any other operations. This is convenient, and having hundreds of developers at Shopify at that point, it was easy for everyone to start dumping non-jobs data to Redis, thanks to the ease of access to <code>Resque.redis</code> in the Rails app.</p>

<p>The side effect of this easy-to-use API was that Redis became overloaded not only by the throughput of background jobs, but also by all arbitrary features where people have plugged <code>Resque.redis</code> to store ephemeral keys like throttles or inventory data.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson #1</strong>: easy to access APIs can get harmful, especially when it’s designed for a smaller scale and misused at a larger scale.</p>

<p>We introduced separate Redis instances for all non-jobs features, and for a while <code>Resque.redis</code> was only used for jobs.</p>

<p><img src="http://kirshatrov.com/assets/post-images/org-layers/v1.png" width="474" alt="VS Code devcontainer feature"></p>

<p>But because <code>Resque.redis</code> didn’t go away as a public API (even though its use was verbally discouraged), a new pile of features have developed that were writing to <code>Resque.redis</code>, mostly because that was a developer habit.</p>

<p>It took us significant amount of efforts to completely remove <code>Resque.redis</code> as a public accessor (see <a href="https://sirupsen.com/shitlists/" target="_blank">shitlist driven development</a>) and move to not exposing Redis clients directly anywhere. Instead of giving Redis access directly, we provide a few Ruby classes that wrap Redis access, like <code>ActiveJob</code>, <code>Throttle</code> or <code>DisposableCounter</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson #2:</strong> it’s going to be much easier to scale a data store when the subset of operations is limited and its clients are not exposed directly to developers.</p>

<h2 id="proxies-and-connection">Proxies and connection</h2>

<p>It’s important to say that <a href="https://redis.io/topics/benchmarks#:~:text=Redis%20is%2C%20mostly%2C%20a%20single,on%20several%20cores%20if%20needed" target="_blank">Redis is single-threaded</a>, which means that it doesn’t employ more than a single CPU. Its authors recommend scaling by introducing more Redis instances running on other CPUs and making your app somehow shard the data across multiple Redis instances - or by using <a href="https://redis.io/topics/cluster-spec" target="_blank">Redis Cluster</a>.</p>

<p>Also, the more client connections are open to Redis, the busier will be that single CPU. We started to notice that connection limits and CPU load were coming to be the two biggest bottlenecks in keeping the platform up.</p>

<p>As we <a href="https://kirshatrov.com/2020/04/27/scaling-mysql-stack-part-4-proxy/" target="_blank">did for the rest of stores</a> like MySQL and memcached, we went with introducing a TCP proxy in front of Redis that would <a href="https://www.percona.com/blog/2019/09/27/multiplexing-mux-in-proxysql/" target="_blank">multiplex</a> client &lt;-&gt; backend connections and reduce the pressure on Redis’ CPU. It’s incredible how much  room you can buy for scalability by putting a proxy in front of Redis/MySQL/memcached.</p>

<p><img src="http://kirshatrov.com/assets/post-images/org-layers/v2.png" width="458" alt="VS Code devcontainer feature"></p>

<h2 id="proxies-and-scalability">Proxies and scalability</h2>

<p>Now all operations to Redis went through a proxy and every feature like jobs or throttles had its own Redis. But every Redis was still single-threaded, and once we had extra load on jobs or on throttles, that Redis would max out on CPU and some operations would get queued and time out. We had to horizontally scale Redis for each feature.</p>

<p>The beauty of having a proxy in front of a database is that you now you can make changes to the backend without having to change clients. Thanks to <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/" target="_blank">Envoy proxy</a>, we’ve been able to swap a single Redis behind the proxy with a pool of multiple Redis instances, and partitioning operations by a key.</p>

<p><img src="http://kirshatrov.com/assets/post-images/org-layers/v3.png" width="516" alt="VS Code devcontainer feature"></p>

<h2 id="layers-of-abstraction">Layers of abstraction</h2>

<p>We’ve had no abstractions at first and developers used to call the Redis client directly for any operations. <strong>We went away from giving the Redis client to providing primitives that work with Redis underneath.</strong></p>

<p>Later we <strong>moved away from making the application connect to Redis directly to giving them something that looks like Redis</strong>, but is actually a proxy that forwards commands to multiple Redis instances managed by infrastructure teams. That abstraction will also allow us to swap those backends on the proxy with another database like <a href="https://keydb.dev/" target="_blank">KeyDB</a> in we wanted to.</p>

<p>These two steps have abstracted Redis access from the application code and decoupled code from the infrastructure, which was the key to making something scale for both the load and the number of developers.</p>

<p>You can see the similar pattern with <a href="https://vitess.io/">Vitess</a>, which makes the client believe that it’s speaking to MySQL while it’s actually speaking to a Go service that applies certain logic and forwards those MySQL queries elsewhere. Used by YouTube, Github and Slack, Vitess is gaining its popularity as a way to horizontally scaling database access without increasing the complexity on the client.</p>

<p>I believe that the increasing amount of abstractions is the reasonable price to pay for scalability. <strong>It works the other way around too</strong>: if some parts of your stack are abstracted and some are not, those that are not abstracted will be the first to become a scalability bottleneck.</p>

<p>14 Dec 2020</p>
<p>Itâ€™s 2020. If you arenâ€™t using a password manager yet, <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/a/45067/211865" target="_blank">drop everything youâ€™re doing and switch to one</a>.</p>

<p>Using password managers is a <em>very</em> good idea. Up until last year, I was using Chromeâ€™s password manager, and it worked well, for the most part. However, I wanted something more dedicated, since I had started to see obvious issues with it (no concept of â€œmasterâ€� password, no special characters in password generators, no cross platform support, etc.). I searched around for password managers, and most reviews recommended options like Dashlane, 1password, Lastpass, etc. Figuring that there wouldnâ€™t be much difference between these options, I decided to give Dashlane a try. After all, everyone did say â€œyou canâ€™t go wrong with any of theseâ€�. Boy, was I wrong.</p>

<p>The more I used Dashlane, the more puzzled I became at some of the design decisions the company chose to make. I ran into some bugs that are not only deal breakers, but are outright security issues. Since I had paid for a year of Dashlaneâ€™s premium subscription, I decided to give it a chance anyway. After having none of those issues go away after 11 months, I decided to just give up and switch to Bitwarden yesterday. In a couple of hours, all my issues magically went away. Here are my gripes with Dashlane:</p>

<h3 id="dashlanes-autofill-feature">Dashlaneâ€™s Autofill feature</h3>
<p>One of the things that annoyed me the most with Dashlane was the â€œauto loginâ€� feature. If youâ€™re on a websiteâ€™s login page and Dashlane has only one login for that, itâ€™ll simply fill the credentials in, and then <strong><em>click the submit buttom for you</em></strong>. The first time it happened to me I was so confused I had no idea what happened. This is just straight up no-no in my books. Software should never do things for you unless you specifically configure it to do that. It should merely suggest and serve helpful suggestions, never do actions on your behalf. Not only that, but:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You canâ€™t click the â€œRemember meâ€� checkbox or interact with the page in any way.</li>
  <li>Some sites have a login page on their home screen, and this feature just makes you jump directly without even asking if you <em>want</em> to log in in the first place.</li>
  <li>Thereâ€™s no global switch to turn off this feature. You literally have to open each password item in the Dashlane app and turn it off. Needless to say, for hundreds of passwords, this feasible at all.</li>
</ul>


<p>Dashlaneâ€™s password fill in popup would just randomly not appear sometimes, both in the extension, and on my Android device, requiring me to open the app and manually copy the password from there. Besides being annoying, this is a very serious security concern, since the only time the password fill in pop up should not appear <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/a/45067/211865" target="_blank">is when youâ€™re on a phishing site</a>.</p>

<p>I even got phished because of this once. Someone messaged me an invite to their Steam account, but the URL was staemcommunity.us (Notice the â€˜aâ€™ and â€˜eâ€™ flipped. Also, Steam doesnâ€™t have a .us domain, but it looked official enough for me in that moment). The page was a 1:1 replica of the steam page, and Dashlane refused to show the password popup. Rolling my eyes, I opened the dashlane app, copied my username and password and even submitted the form. Thankfully, the minute I submitted it I realized something was wrong (the page told me that my username/password combo was incorrect, which it couldnâ€™t possibly be), and I figured out I was phished, and changed my credentials quickly. This would have never happened had Dashlaneâ€™s popup been more reliable for me.</p>

<h3 id="no-desktop-app-support-for-linux">No Desktop App support for Linux</h3>
<p>I solely use <a href="https://pop.system76.com/" target="_blank">Pop!OS</a> for everything, including gaming. Imagine my disppointment when I found that Dashlaneâ€™s desktop app only supports Windows and Mac. Without the app, you canâ€™t use Dashlaneâ€™s VPN (why would you pay for premium then?). You also canâ€™t use features like password export.</p>

<p>To shift to Bitwarden, I literally had to download Windows 10, create a virtual machine, install the app, then use the export feature. <em>Why doesnâ€™t the web app have such a basic utility feature?</em></p>

<h3 id="no-ability-to-lock-extension-on-sleep">No ability to lock extension on sleep</h3>
<p>Whenever I lock/put my device to sleep, I want to extension to lock itself too, otherwise there really isnâ€™t any point to having a master password. Dashlane has no such feature. Anyone who can someone get in my machine also suddenly has access to all my passwords. Bitwarden, a free service, has that feature.</p>

<h3 id="broken-password-export">Broken Password Export</h3>
<p>Thankfully, Dashlane offers to export all your stored information in a JSON so you can shift to some other (read: better) password manager. However, after migrating to Bitwarden, I noticed that it wasnâ€™t working well with subdomains. My first instinct was to blame Bitwarden, but upon inspecting the JSON export of my information, I found out that Dashlane had grouped together passwords for all subdomains into the domain. For example, the passwords for <code>abc.example.com</code> and <code>pqr.example.com</code> were stored in the JSON as 2 different passwords for <code>example.com</code>. Morever, none of my â€œSecure Notesâ€� had made it in the export. Iâ€™m going to have to manually spend some time to clean up this mess.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Just use Bitwarden. Itâ€™s free, and the premium plan is 1/5th the price of Dashlane, and it is much more usable and has more features than Dashlane.</p>

<p>The price of bitcoin is headed back over $19,000 again. What will it take to push it past $20,000—more tethers? More institutional buying? Or maybe, more crypto journalists proclaiming (without evidence) that tethers are fully backed? Here’s the news: </p>



<h2>MicroStrategy wants more, more, more</h2>



<p>Michael Saylor, the new crazy god of bitcoin institutional buying, continues his bitcoin buying spree. He seems really, really confident the price of BTC will go up. </p>



<p>Saylor’s publicly traded company MicroStrategy currently owns 40,824 bitcoins—because no sense using all that excess cash for buying back a ton of stock or paying a big dividend. Better off to gamble it on crypto. </p>



<p>Now the firm is actually going into debt to buy bitcoin. After completing a $650 million bond offering, MicroStrategy plans to plow all the proceeds into buying more bitcoin. (<a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/en/company/company-videos/microstrategy-completes-650-million-offering-of-convertible-senior-notes">Microstrategy PR</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/microstrategy-completes-650-million-bond-sale-to-finance-next-bitcoin-purchase">Cointelegraph</a>)</p>



<p>Citibank isn’t impressed. Analyst Tyler Radke downgraded MicroStrategy (MSTR) from neutral to sell, calling the recent rally—MSTR went up after its first few BTC buying announcements—”overextended” and a possibly “deal-breaker” for software investors. (<a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/87054/citi-microstrategy-stock-downgrade-bitcoin">The Block</a>)</p>



<h2>Tether: Ain’t no stopping us now</h2>



<p>Tether is now at <a href="https://archive.is/wip/aITvG">$20 billion worth of tether</a>—that’s assets, but circulating supply is soon to follow—and there is no evidence whatsoever to conclude that there is $20 billion in real cash behind all those tethers.&nbsp;Why? Because the company has never had a formal audit. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Still, last month, The Block’s Larry Cermak <a href="https://twitter.com/ahcastor/status/1338273950078398465">defended tethers</a> as being “either fully backed or very, very close,” telling folks “everything is in order now.” He based that on conversations he claimed to have had with “third-parties” who told him they had successfully redeemed several hundred million in tethers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cermak is not the only one to buy the Tether line of B.S. </p>



<p>In December 2018, after <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-18/crypto-mystery-clues-suggest-tether-has-the-billions-it-promised">looking at Tether bank statements</a>, Bloomberg’s Matt Leising also reported that Tether appeared to be fully backed. He was wrong.</p>



<p>Unbeknownst to him at the time, in the previous two months, the DOJ froze five NY bank accounts <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/05/02/the-us-government-wants-man-at-the-center-of-massive-cryptocurrency-scheme-held-without-bail/">belonging to Reginald Fowler</a>, who ran a shadow banking service for Tether/Bitfinex’s Panamanian payment processor. And in November, the NYAG, having serious concerns about Tether’s finances, <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2019/attorney-general-james-announces-court-order-against-crypto-currency-company">issued subpoenas to Bitfinex and Tether</a> asking for details on their banking. Finally, in April 2019, Tether admitted it was only <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tether-lawyer-confirms-stablecoin-74-percent-backed-by-cash-and-equivalents">74% backed</a>. And that’s before it went off and printed another 17.5 billion tethers. So what’s backing all those?  </p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2020/12/13/tether-is-too-big-to-fail-the-entire-crypto-industry-utterly-depends-on-it/">blog post</a>, David Gerard explains why Tether is “too big to fail.” Essentially, it’s keeping the entire BTC market afloat. If Tether were to get the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/nyregion/liberty-reserve-operators-accused-of-money-laundering.html">Liberty Reserve treatment</a>, the price of bitcoin is unlikely to ever recover. </p>



<p>Thus, “the purpose of the crypto industry, and all its little service sub-industries, is to generate a narrative—so as to maintain and enhance the flow of actual dollars from suckers, and keep the party going,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>NYAG: Tether documents forthcoming</h2>



<p>Meanwhile, there’s been a new document filing in the NYAG Tether probe.<a href="https://twitter.com/NewYorkStateAG"> </a></p>



<p>In a <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=2AsYgvjJAsSdalpfkInbHA==">letter</a> to the Supreme Court, NYAG says Bitfinex/Tether are cooperating on document production and the parties expect to finalize things “in the coming weeks.” These documents, of course, consist of everything NYAG asked for in its original November 2018 subpoena—information that will shed light on the Tether and Bitfinex’s shadowy dealings since 2015. </p>



<p>A part of me wants to get excited about this news, but another part says, wait a minute. In the past when Tether’s operators said they were going to hand documents over, they simply handed over material that was already public information. They also have a <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/01/17/the-curious-case-of-tether-a-complete-timeline-of-events/">long history</a> of shenanigans, so let’s just wait and see.  </p>



<h2><strong>How to turn USDT into cash&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Jorge Stolfi, a computer scientist from Brazil, shared on <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/kbf5jj/yes_here_we_are_holy_shit_weve_done_it_our_boi/gfmqa1o/">Reddit</a> a “mainstream theory” on what could be happening behind-the-scenes at Tether—specifically, how Tether’s operators could convert USDT into cash for their own personal use. Remember, this is totally unproven. It is just a theory. (The “triad,” by the way, refers to Tether CSO Phil Potter, CEO and <a href="https://archive.is/DfBMP">man of mystery</a>&nbsp;J.L. van der Velde,&nbsp;and CFO Giancarlo Devasini. They are the same operators behind sister company Bitfinex.)</p>



<p>He writes:</p>



<ol><li>The owners of Tether Inc (which I will call “the Triad”) print billions of USDT without any backing.</li><li>The Triad deposits those USDT into Bitfinex (which they own too).</li><li>The Triad uses those USDT to buy BTC and other cryptos from other Bitfinex clients, attracted by the better price.</li><li>The Triad withdraws the BTC to their private wallets.</li><li>The Triad moves all or some of those BTC to other exchanges that handle real currencies, such as USD, EUR, JPY, etc.</li><li>The Triad sells those BTC for real money.</li><li>The Triad withdraws the real money into their personal bank accounts.</li></ol>



<p>This is a theory. This is not proven. But the point is, when you have no checks and balances in place along with massive loopholes in oversight, <em>anything</em> can happen. We <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/02/12/how-the-hell-did-we-get-here-a-timeline-of-quadrigacx-events/">saw this</a> already with QuadrigaCX—the Canadian crypto exchange that went bankrupt after the founder disappeared (aka “died in India”), taking along with him hundreds of millions of dollars in customer funds.  </p>



<h2>Coinbase loses half critical security team</h2>



<p>After NYT reporter Nathaniel Popper <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/technology/coinbase-cryptocurrency-black-employees.html">reported</a> about discriminatory complaints at Coinbase, <a href="https://twitter.com/nathanielpopper/status/1336072433091059712">new information came out</a>. Among those who recently resigned to protest the exchange’s new internal policies, were four of the seven people on Coinbase’s critical security team—aka the “key management team.” </p>

<h2>MassMutual invests in BTC</h2>



<p>Bitcoin has a new institutional investor: MassMutual. The Springfield-Mass insurance firm purchased $100 million worth of BTC for its general investment account, which totals $235 billion. (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/massmutual-joins-the-bitcoin-club-with-100-million-purchase-11607626800">WSJ</a>)</p>



<p>MassMutual purchased the bitcoin through NYDIG, a New York-based fund management company, which has  $2.3 billion worth of crypto under management. MassMutual also acquired a $5 million minority equity stake in NYDIG.</p>



<p>The $100 million cash injection into bitcoin sounds like a lot, but it’s small potatoes. That money will cover the network’s operators—the bitcoin miners—for only six days. Remember, bitcoin miners are selling their 900 newly minted bitcoin per day for $17 million, at current BTC prices. Investors will never see that money again. Bitcoin doesn’t make any real profits on its own—just investor money going in one end, out the other. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been writing JSON-REST APIs in Python for a number of years, and over that time I've found the tooling has greatly improved. To show you how you can benefit I'm going to show you how I've evolved. However, if you want to skip to the tooling I use today take a look at <a href="https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart-schema">Quart-Schema</a>.</p> <p>Writing JSON-REST APIs in Python using Flask/Quart has always been pleasent. Yet communicating the API structure (routes, data, etc) to third parties and to my future self has not been. It is also difficult to guarantee that the API works as the documentation says it does. This has resulted in isses, bugs and misuse, in production I'd love to have avoided.</p> <p>I think I would have avoided these if the APIs I wrote,</p> <ul> <li>ensured that any data received or sent matched the communicated structure,</li> <li>communicated their structure using standardised documentation, specifically <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a>,</li> <li>were setup such that linting checks informed me if I made any mistakes,</li> <li>took less effort to write (whilst acheiving these aims).</li> </ul> <h2 id="initial-flask-setup">Initial Flask setup</h2> <p>This is a simple example of how I used to write a Flask APIs,</p> <pre><code><span>@app.route("/todo/", methods=["POST"])</span>
<span><span>def</span> <span>create_todo</span>():</span>
    data = request.get_json()
    todo_id = create_todo(data[<span>"task"</span>], data[<span>"due"</span>])
    todo = {<span>"id"</span>: todo_id, <span>"task"</span>: data[<span>"task"</span>], <span>"due"</span>: data[<span>"due"</span>]}
    <span>return</span> jsonify(todo), <span>201</span>
</code></pre> <p>which works very nicely, but meet none of my aims. Both myself and third party user would have to read the code to understand what is sent and returned by the API.</p> <p>It also does not help to know when the wrong data has been sent. For example <code>due</code> should be a date but if it isn't the <code>create_todo</code> function will raise a <code>ValueError</code> resulting in the API returning a 500 response. It should return a 400 response so that the third party and I can tell that it is an error with the data rather than a server or programming issue.</p> <h2 id="flask-with-docstrings">Flask with docstrings</h2> <p>In an attempt to solve the documentation problem experienced with the simple Flask setup I tried the <a href="https://sphinxcontrib-httpdomain.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">sphinx autohttp extensions</a>,</p> <pre><code><span>@app.route("/todo/", methods=["POST"])</span>
<span><span>def</span> <span>create_todo</span>():</span>
    <span>"""Create a TODO task.

    .. :quickref: Create a TODO.

    :reqheader Accept: application/json
    :&lt;json string task: task description
    :&lt;json string due: todo due date
    :&gt;json int id: todo unique identifier
    :&gt;json string task: task description
    :&gt;json string due: todo due date
    :resheader Content-Type: application/json
    :status 201: post created
    """</span>
    data = request.get_json()
    todo_id = create_todo(data[<span>"task"</span>], data[<span>"due"</span>])
    todo = {<span>"id"</span>: todo_id, <span>"task"</span>: data[<span>"task"</span>], <span>"due"</span>: data[<span>"due"</span>]}
    <span>return</span> jsonify(todo), <span>201</span>
</code></pre> <p>which enables documentation to be created by manually specifying the data structures in the docstring.</p> <p>Whilst this helps with the documentation it has the same issues as the simpler Flask example, in that it doesn't validate the data sent to the route, nor the data returned. It also doesn't help with any linters, for example a simple typo like <code>data["duo"]</code> would only raise an error during testing, or worse in production.</p> <p>The bigger issue though, is writing the docstring documentation as it is time consuming, boring work that I (and my colleagues) would forget to do. Over time this lead to the documentation being wrong leading to distrust and lack of use.</p> <p>I eventually stopped using this technique and reverted to the simpler example as this documentation ended up actively misleading. It also became clear that the winning documentation standard was OpenAPI, rather than sphinx documentation.</p> <h2 id="aside-switch-to-quart">Aside switch to Quart</h2> <p>It was around this time in that I switched from writing APIs in Flask to writing them in <a href="https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart">Quart</a>. The snippets onwards in this article will now assume Quart, but the only difference is the use of async/await keywords, you can remove them to get a Flask equivalent.</p> <p>I wrote Quart as I wanted to start using the <code>async</code> <code>await</code> keywords and libraries. You can remove <code>async</code>, <code>await</code> from the examples to get a Flask equivalent.</p> <h2 id="jsonschema-decorators">JSONSchema decorators</h2> <p>The data sent and received in the APIs I write is formatted as JSON. This means a <a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSONSchema</a> could be used to describe the structure and used to validate that any data matches it. This allows me to write decorators that accept JSONSchemas to validate request and response data,</p> <pre><code><span>from</span> functools <span>import</span> wraps
<span>from</span> typing <span>import</span> Any, Callable, Dict

<span>import</span> fastjsonschema
<span>from</span> quart <span>import</span> abort, make_response, request

    <span>"""This validates the request JSON.

    validator = fastjsonschema.<span>compile</span>(schema)

    <span>"""This validates the response JSON.

    The schemas are keyed by status code.
    """</span>
    validators = {
        status: fastjsonschema.<span>compile</span>(schema)
        <span>for</span> status, schema <span>in</span> schemas.items()
    }

    <span><span>def</span> <span>decorator</span>(<span>func: Callable</span>) -&gt; Callable:</span>

            response = <span>await</span> make_response(result)
            <span>if</span> response.status_code <span>in</span> validators:
                validators[response.status_code](<span>await</span> response.get_json())

            <span>return</span> response

        <span>return</span> wrapper

    <span>return</span> decorator
</code></pre> <p>These can then be used, for example,</p> <pre><code><span>@app.route("/todo/", methods=["POST"])</span>
<span>@validate_request(</span>
    {
        <span>"type"</span>: <span>"object"</span>,

            <span>"task"</span>: {<span>"type"</span>: <span>"string"</span>},
        },
        <span>"required"</span>: [<span>"due"</span>, <span>"task"</span>],
        <span>"additionalProperties"</span>: <span>False</span>,

                <span>"due"</span>: {<span>"type"</span>: <span>"string"</span>, <span>"format"</span>: <span>"date"</span>},
                <span>"id"</span>: {<span>"type"</span>: <span>"number"</span>},
                <span>"task"</span>: {<span>"type"</span>: <span>"string"</span>},

    data = <span>await</span> request.get_json()
    todo_id = create_todo(data[<span>"task"</span>], data[<span>"due"</span>])
    todo = {<span>"id"</span>: todo_id, <span>"task"</span>: data[<span>"task"</span>], <span>"due"</span>: data[<span>"due"</span>]}
    <span>return</span> todo, <span>201</span>
</code></pre> <p>The JSONSchemas can then be used as the documentation either when developing or to create an openapi specification of the API for third parties.</p> <p>This solves the validation and documentation problems, whilst ensuring that the documentation stays correct. It is however just as painful to write as the sphinx docstrings (although now it cannot be ignored). It also doesn't help linters understand what we are doing with the data.</p> <h2 id="dataclass-decorators">Dataclass decorators</h2> <p>To gain help from the linting tools the data needs to be defined in a structure they understand. Conveniently Python 3.7 shipped dataclasses which we can use to define the structure and will enable IDEs and linters to alert me of any issues. By altering the decorator to <a href="https://github.com/s-knibbs/dataclasses-jsonschema">convert</a> the dataclass to a JSONSchema allows a dataclass to be used instead,</p> <pre><code><span>@dataclass</span>
<span><span>class</span> <span>TodoData</span>:</span>
    due: date
    task: <span>str</span>

<span>@dataclass</span>
<span><span>class</span> <span>Todo</span>(<span>TodoData</span>):</span>
    <span>id</span>: <span>int</span>

<span>@app.route("/todo/", methods=["POST"])</span>
<span>@validate_request(TodoData)</span>
<span>@validate_response(Todo, 201)</span>
<span>async</span> <span><span>def</span> <span>index</span>() -&gt; Todo:</span>
    data = <span>await</span> request.get_json()
    todo_data = TodoData(**data)
    todo_id = create_todo(todo_data.task, todo_data.due)
    <span>return</span> Todo(<span>id</span>=todo_id, task=todo_data.task, due=todo_data.due), <span>201</span>
</code></pre> <p>which is actually quite pleasant code to write and actually makes it quicker (with the IDE autocompletion) than any of the previous examples.</p> <p>I have been experimenting with the code to make the dataclass decorators work for a while, and it isn't the easiest. Thankfully I recently came across <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/dataclasses/">pydantic's dataclasses</a> which validate the arguments, and can generate schemas for documentation.</p> <h2 id="quart-schema-conclusion-">Quart-Schema (Conclusion)</h2> <p><a href="https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart-schema">Quart-Schema</a> is a Quart extension that provides the validation decorators and auto-generated documentation. The example in this article in full is,</p> <pre><code><span>from</span> datetime <span>import</span> date

<span>from</span> pydantic.dataclasses <span>import</span> dataclass
<span>from</span> quart <span>import</span> Quart
<span>from</span> quart_schema <span>import</span> QuartSchema, validate_request, validate_response

app = Quart(__name__)

<span>@dataclass</span>
<span><span>class</span> <span>TodoData</span>:</span>

<span><span>class</span> <span>Todo</span>(<span>TodoData</span>):</span>
    <span>id</span>: <span>int</span>

</code></pre> <p>with the documentation available at <code>/docs</code> or <code>/openapi.json</code> for the raw form.</p> <p>I think, with Quart-Schema, that I've finally achieved all my initial aims in a form that is very clear and simple to write. This has only been possible with the async/await, type hinting, and dataclass improvements to Python made over the past few years.</p> <p>I'd quite like to know what you think of this - I'm on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/pdgjones">@pdgjones</a>.</p> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>TORONTO -- 
	The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (<a href="https://www.unhcr.org/" target="_blank">UNHCR</a>) is marking the 70th anniversary of its operation in Canada with a free digital cookbook featuring recipes and personal stories of "resilience, heartbreak and hope" from refugees across Canada.</p>
<p>
	The cookbook, titled "Tastes from Home: Recipes from the Refugee Community," features more than 30 recipes and personal stories from 14 former refugees including Minister of Families, Children and Social Development Ahmed Hussen and former Governor General of Canada Adrienne Clarkson.</p>
<p>
	For every <a href="https://act.unhcr.ca/page/71880/petition/1?ea.tracking.id=SOC20_UNR_TFHEM" target="_blank">copy of the cookbook downloaded</a>, an anonymous donor will be making a donation to UNHCR in support of refugees and their families.</p>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.unhcr.ca/" target="_blank">UNHCR Canada</a> spokesperson Lauren La Rose told CTVNews.ca the cookbook is an opportunity to share the traditions and cultures of refugees, but also "reflect on the journey that brought them" to Canada.</p>
<p>
	"Food is just such a connective thread in all of our lives and not just from the standpoint of being nourishing and life sustaining, but it connects families and friends and communities," La Rose said in a telephone interview on Thursday.</p>
<p>
	She added that sharing food with others can be "optimistic and hopeful."</p>
<p>
	"Food is such a powerful communicator. You can share love with food, you can, in a small way, even educate people with food," La Rose explained. "The cookbook gives you a chance to really expand on your own kind of culinary journey in terms of using different spices and ingredients, or putting together different dishes that you might not have before."</p>
<h3>
	SHARING RECIPES AND STORIES</h3>
<p>
	Minister Ahmed Hussen hopes the recipes and stories shared in this cookbook help to humanize refugees and show their resilience in striving for a better life.</p>
<p>
	"Refugees are humans just like us," Hussen said in a telephone interview with CTVNews.ca on Thursday. "They're real people who just happen to be displaced.</p>
<p>
	"Refugees are not monolithic, they come from all corners of the world, they have different experiences, they have different genders and ages and skill sets and perspectives -- and that's OK because they reflect humanity," he added.</p>
<p>
	Hussen has three recipes in UNHCR Canada’s cookbook: spaghetti with tomato sauce and basil, grilled swordfish, and garlic-butter scallops.</p>
<p>
	Growing up in eastern Somalia on the Indian Ocean coast, Hussen said the majority of the food he ate was centered around seafood, or had an Italian influence as parts of Somalia were controlled by Italy at the time.</p>
<p>
	Hussen and his family later immigrated to Canada in 1993.</p>
<p>
	Hussen said he doesn’t cook often but when he does, it reminds him of his mother who ran the home and raised a family, all while finding the time to prepare nourishing meals on a daily basis.</p>
<p>
	"We weren't rich or anything, we were working class family, but she did a lot with a few ingredients and living next to the ocean certainly had a huge influence on us, as did the Italian influence," he explained.</p>
<p>
	While the cookbook's recipes highlight the culture of refugees, Hussen said the personal stories also provide an opportunity for asylum-seekers to reflect on their past.</p>
<p>
	"It's a chance for all of us who were once refugees to find out a little bit more about the stories of other refugees, and their experiences in their homelands and their story of survival and resilience in the face of difficulties," Hussen said.</p>
<p>
	For former Governor General of Canada Adrienne Clarkson, she says she likely wouldn’t have learned how to cook had she not immigrated to Canada from Japanese-occupied Hong Kong in 1941.</p>
<p>
	"I probably would not have ever cooked if I'd stayed in Hong Kong because it's a class society and so I would have run a house, but I would have had a cook and so I would have been telling a cook what to do," Clarkson explained in a telephone interview with CTVNews.ca on Thursday.</p>
<p>
	Clarkson, who was Governor General from 1999-2005, has contributed a poached Chinese chicken recipe to UNHCR Canada's cookbook, which she says is a dish that "shows Chinese cooking at its finest."</p>
<p>
	Clarkson said she learned to cook at the age of nine from her mother who made traditional, home-cooked Chinese meals three or four times a week for the family.</p>
<p>
	Clarkson said she thought knowing how to cook would be a valuable skill should her family ever have to flee again.</p>
<p>
	"I love cooking and I always have and I guess that was because I was a refugee. We always thought that if there were another war, we'd have to go somewhere and make our life again as we had when we first came to Canada," Clarkson said.</p>
<p>
	"Because you've been a refugee once, you never doubt that you could lose everything again," she added.</p>
<p>
	Clarkson said the cookbook's recipes and personal stories show that when refugees come to Canada, they make the country their home, but also bring some parts of their culture to share with others.</p>
<p>
	She added that there are few things that bring people of different backgrounds together like a home-cooked meal.</p>
<p>
	"I think doing things for yourself and having that satisfaction that you've cooked something wonderful for your family, nothing can replace that," Clarkson said.</p>
<h3>
	REFUGEE CRISIS</h3>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.unhcr.ca/" target="_blank">According to UNHCR</a>, Canada has been a global leader in refugee resettlement and has welcomed more than one million refugees since 1980. In 2018, Canada resettled <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/canada-resettled-more-refugees-than-any-other-country-in-2018-un-says-1.4473523" target="_blank">more refugees than any other country</a>.</p>
<p>
	While La Rose acknowledges that Canada has "accomplished quite a bit" when it comes to helping those who have been displaced, she says "there's still a long way to go."</p>
<p>
	According to the UNHCR, 80 million people are displaced worldwide including more than 26 million refugees.</p>
<p>
	"We're so fortunate to have the 14 individuals who are now part of the Canadian family to share their stories in this cookbook, but there's so many more out there that are in need of support and assistance," La Rose said.</p>
<p>
	La Rose explained that the Canadian operation of the UN refugee agency was created in 1950 following the Second World War to help address the "large numbers" of people who were uprooted in Europe following the war's end.</p>
<p>
	"The mandate of UNHCR Canada was only supposed to last for three years, and here we are, 70 years after that because the need remains immensely great," La Rose said.</p>
<p>
	By hearing directly from refugees who have found a home in Canada, La Rose said she hopes the cookbook will raise more awareness about UNHCR Canada and the work it does in helping asylum-seekers.</p>
<p>
	"We hope that people will walk away with a little bit more of an insight in education on what causes people to be displaced, and the fact that there's so many more people in need," La Rose said.</p>

<p><strong>The concept of I-frames, P-frames, and B-frames is fundamental to the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression#Video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video compression</a>. These three frame types are used in specific situations to improve the stream’s <a href="https://ottverse.com/need-for-video-compression/">compression efficiency,</a> video quality, and resilience.</strong></p>



<p>In this tutorial, we look at how I-frames, P-frames, and B-frames work and what they are used for. If you are into video compression, do read our</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://ottverse.com/discrete-cosine-transform-dct-video-compression/">tutorial on the discrete cosine transform</a>,</li><li><a href="https://ottverse.com/need-for-video-compression/">why video compression is important</a>,</li><li>and a <a href="https://ottverse.com/what-is-a-video-codec/">layman’s explanation of what a video codec is and how it’s created</a>.</li></ul>



<p>Okay, with that, let’s get started with a couple of fundamental aspects of modern day video compression – Intra and Inter prediction.</p>



<h2>Inter and Intra Prediction</h2>



<p>I won’t do a deep dive of Intra and Inter-prediction in this article, but, I’ll give you an idea of why these exist and what they are meant for. </p>



<p>Take, for example, the image below. It shows two video frames (adjacent to each other) with a rectangular block of black pixels. In frame 1, the block is on the left-hand side of the image, and in the second frame, it has moved to the right.</p>



<p>If I want to compress Frame #2 using a modern video codec like H.264 or HEVC, I would do something as follows – </p>



<ol><li>Break the video into blocks of pixels (<strong>macroblocks</strong>) and compress them one at a time.</li><li>In order to compress each macroblock, the first step is to find a macroblock similar to the one we want to compress by searching in the current frame or previous or future frames.</li><li>The best-match macroblock’s location is recorded (which frame and its position in that frame). Then, the two macroblocks’ difference is compressed and sent to the decoder along with the location information. </li></ol>



<p>With me so far? Good! </p>



<p>Take a look at the image below. If I want to compress the macroblock in Frame #2 (that I’ve marked with a red square), what do you think is the best option? Or how should it be done?</p>



<div><figure><img width="872" height="476" src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-25.png?resize=872%2C476&amp;ssl=1" alt="I-frames, P-frames, and B-frames and Intra Prediction" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-25.png?w=872&amp;ssl=1 872w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-25.png?resize=300%2C164&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-25.png?resize=768%2C419&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-25.png?resize=870%2C476&amp;ssl=1 870w" sizes="(max-width: 872px) 100vw, 872px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20872%20476'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-25.png?w=872&amp;ssl=1 872w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-25.png?resize=300%2C164&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-25.png?resize=768%2C419&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-25.png?resize=870%2C476&amp;ssl=1 870w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-25.png?resize=872%2C476&amp;ssl=1"></figure></div>



<ol><li>First, I can look in frame #1 and find the matching block. It appears to have moved by a distance approximately the frame’s width (a little less, I know) and approximately at the same height. Good, we have the motion vector now. </li><li>I can search within the same frame and quickly realize that the block above the one marked in red is IDENTICAL to it. So, I can tell the decoder to copy that one instead of hunting in another frame. The motion vector (if any) is also minimal.</li></ol>







<p><strong>Now take a look at the next example. We want to compress the macroblock containing the blue sphere in frame #2. How should we go about doing this? Search within the same frame or search in previously encoded frames?</strong></p>

<ol id="block-12e1077d-9448-49d1-a769-8b5a645b4186"><li>First, I can look in frame #1 and find the matching sphere. It appears to have moved by a distance approximately the frame’s width (a little less, I know) and moved up a little. This gives us the motion vector. The difference between the two blocks containing spheres appears to be very small (guesstimate!)</li><li>Second, I can search within the same frame and realize no other block contains a sphere. So, bad luck searching for a match within the same frame! </li></ol>



<p>So, what did we learn from these toy examples?</p>



<ol><li><span>Encoders search for matching macroblocks to reduce the size of the data that needs to be transmitted. This is done via a process of </span><strong>motion estimation and compensation.</strong><span> This allows the encoder to find the horizontal and vertical displacement of a macroblock in another frame.</span></li><li>An encoder can search for a matching block <strong>within the same frame (Intra Prediction)</strong> and <strong>adjacent (Inter Prediction) frames</strong>.</li><li>It compares the Inter and Intra prediction results for each macroblock and chooses the “best” one. This process is dubbed “Mode Decision,” and in my opinion, it’s the heart of a video codec.</li></ol>



<p>Again, sorry for the super fast explanation of Intra and Inter Prediction. It’s a vast topic, and I haven’t even scratched the surface. In a future article, I’ll talk about the different ways to perform motion estimation, fast searches, sub-pel motion estimation, early exits, and so many amazing aspects of motion estimation and compensation! </p>



<p>For now, with this whirlwind introduction to Intra and Inter prediction, let’s learn about I, P, and B frames.</p>



<h2>What is an I-frame?</h2>



<p><strong>An I-frame or a Key-Frame or an Intra-frame consists ONLY of macroblocks that use Intra-prediction</strong>. That’s it.</p>



<p>Any macroblock in an I-frame is allowed to refer to other macroblocks only within the same frame. That is, it can only use “<strong>spatial redundancies</strong>” in the frame for compression. </p>



<p>An I-frame comes in different avatars – IDR, CRA, BLA, etc. but the essence remains. No temporal prediction allowed. </p>



<p>An I-frame has many uses which we’ll study after the introduction to P and B-frames. </p>



<h2>What is a P-frame?</h2>



<p>P-frame stands for Predicted Frame and allows macroblocks to be compressed using temporal prediction in addition to spatial prediction. For motion estimation, P-frames use frames that have been previously encoded. In essence, every macroblock in a P-frame can be, </p>



<ul><li>temporally predicted, or</li><li>spatially predicted, or</li><li>skipped (i.e, you tell the decoder to copy the co-located block from the previous frame – a “zero” motion vector).</li></ul>

<p>I made an illustration to drive home an important point. You can see both I-frames and P-frames in the image above. The P-frames refer to previously encoded I/P-frames as discussed earlier. You can also see that the order in which the frames are encoded/decoded is the same as how they are presented to the user. This is because P-frames only refer to previously encoded pictures. </p>



<h2>What is a B-frame?</h2>



<p>A B-frame is a frame that can refer to frames that occur both before and after it. The <strong>B</strong> stands for Bi-Directional for this reason. If your video codec uses macroblock based compression (like H.264/AVC does), then each macroblock of a B-frame can</p>



<ul><li>be predicted using backward prediction (using frames that occur in the future)</li><li>be predicted using forward prediction (using frames that occur in the past)</li><li>be predicted without inter-prediction – only Intra</li><li>can be skipped completely (with Intra or Inter prediction).</li></ul>



<p>And because they have the ability to refer to and interpolate from two (or more) frames that occur before and after it (in the time dimension), B-frames can be incredibly efficient in reducing the size of the frame while retaining the video quality. </p>



<p>However, B-frames are resource-heavy – both at the encoder and decoder. Let’s see why! </p>



<p>To understand the impact of B-frames, let’s understand the concepts of <strong>Presentation/Display Order</strong> and <strong>Decoding Order</strong>. </p>



<p>Taking the simple case of I and P frames. If you use only these two picture types, every frame will either refer to itself (I-frame) or to a previous frame (P-frame). So, the frames can come in and out of the encoder in the same order. Here, the Presentation Order (or Display Order) is the same as the Decode/Encode order. </p>

<p>But, if a frame refers to another frame that is displayed in the future, what do you do? This is the situation that we see when we use B-frames for compression. Take a look at the image below that shows a GOP (group of pictures) structure that uses two B-pictures and one P in each mini-GOP. i.e., IBBPBBP. </p>



<div><figure><img width="898" height="519" src="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-28.png?resize=898%2C519&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-28.png?w=898&amp;ssl=1 898w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-28.png?resize=300%2C173&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-28.png?resize=768%2C444&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 898px) 100vw, 898px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20898%20519'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-28.png?w=898&amp;ssl=1 898w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-28.png?resize=300%2C173&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-28.png?resize=768%2C444&amp;ssl=1 768w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-28.png?resize=898%2C519&amp;ssl=1"></figure></div>



<p>Frame #2 in Display Order is a B-frame that depends on Frames 1 &amp; 4 as references. But, to encode Frame#2, we need to wait till Frame #4 enters the encoder, is encoded, and only then available as a Reference for Frame #2. </p>



<p>The same thing occurs at the decoder. </p>



<p>The decoder decodes Frame #1 (I-frame) and then Frame #2 (P-frame) in decoding order. But, it cannot display Frame #2 because it is actually Frame #4 in Display Order! So, it needs to place it in a buffer until it is time to display it.</p>



<p>So, the encoder and decoder need to maintain two “orders” in memory – one to display the frames and the other to encode/decode them.</p>



<p>So, B-frames do impact the size of the decoder’s buffer and increases latency. So, many systems force you to be careful and not use too many predictors (e.g., 3 or 4 future frames) to predict a single B-frame. As another example, H.264/AVC’s Baseline profile is aimed at low-end devices and does not allow the use of B-frames or slices.</p>



<h2>Reference B-frame and Non-Reference B-frames</h2>



<p>As we’ve learned, a B-frame can refer to two or more frames – typically, one in the future and one in the past regarding its position. We also learned that an I-frame does not refer to any other frame and a P-frame refers to a picture in the past. The question naturally arises – can any picture use a B-picture as its reference frame?</p>



<p>The answer is <strong>Yes</strong>. </p>



<ul><li>A B-frame can act as a reference, and if so, it is termed as a reference B-frame.</li><li>If a B-frame is not to be used as a reference, it is called a non-reference B-frame. </li></ul>



<p>It is important to signal whether a frame is a reference or a non-reference B-frame in the bitstream because the decoder needs to store reference frames in its DPB (Decoded Picture Buffer). </p>



<p><strong>If a frame is signaled as a non-reference B-frame, and it is used as a reference, the decoder could crash </strong>because, in all likelihood, the decoder would have discarded that frame after decoding and displaying it.</p>



<p>Most decoders will quantize reference B-frames at a better quality than non-reference B-frames to minimize propogation losses. </p>



<h2>Use of I, P, and B-frames in Video Compression &amp; Streaming</h2>



<p>With a technical understanding of how I-frames, P-frames, and B-frames work, now let’s tackle an important question. <strong>Why should you use them?</strong></p>



<p>In the next few sections, let’s understand the most important use cases of I, P, and B-frames in video compression.<strong> </strong></p>



<h3>Where do you use I-frames?</h3>



<p>We learned in the earlier sections that I-frames can be independently encoded and decoded and this drives their usage in video compression. </p>



<h3>Refreshing Video Quality</h3>



<p>I-frames are generally inserted to designate the end of a GOP (Group of Pictures) or a video …</p></div></div></article></main></div></div></div></div>

  <p>
    If you've ever managed any software project, you've probably asked
    yourself: how could our teams move faster? How fast are we moving today?
  </p>

  <p>
    For these kinds of questions, it's tempting to turn to metrics. After all,
    we use metrics routinely and successfully when we develop software. There's
    performance, production load, and uptime metrics. There are also metrics
    based on customer behavior, like conversion and retention. These metrics
    don't just provide visibility. More importantly, they create a feedback
    loop. We can make a change that is intended to improve something, and use
    metrics to see how much improvement there really was. Developer wisdom says
    that every software performance optimization must start with a measure,
    which makes perfect sense.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since metrics are so helpful, can't we apply them to software development
    speed? As better development processes should improve development output,
    maybe output metrics could measure whether processes really improved. So
    then, what metrics could we use?
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="we-dont-have-any-good-metrics-for-that">
    <a href="#we-dont-have-any-good-metrics-for-that">We don't have any good metrics for that</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    Development speed is the amount of work produced per unit of time, so we
    need to measure both output and time. Measuring time is simple, no problem
    there. What about work output? Attempts to measure it are as old as
    software itself. Through the years one thing's held true: whenever we
    decide a metric measures work output, something unintended soon follows.
    Consider the following examples:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Lines of code</b> - Probably the oldest one. Almost no one takes it
      seriously today. Counting code lines just makes the code bloated and the
      developers focus on the simplest task possible;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>No. of commits</b> - encourages developers to break up their commits
      into many parts. Once again, the focus is on the simplest tasks and
      refactorings. Complex problems are avoided;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>No. of tasks completed</b> - leads to tasks being split into subtasks.
      Every problem, even minor, is submitted as a task. Also adds an incentive
      to cut corners to complete tasks as fast as possible;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>No. of bugs, or percentage of bugs</b> - not a metric of work output,
      but work quality. Discourages developers from making changes, and makes
      them reluctant to report bugs that they found themselves;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Man-hours or storypoints</b> - when estimates form the basis for how
      team performance is measured, it's easy to guess what comes next —
      inflated estimates;
    </li>
    <li>... and so on.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Developers are smart. They specialize in cracking complex problems. For any
    metric you give them, they'll find the easiest way to improve on it. This
    way most likely won't correlate with work quality or desired project
    outcome. This doesn't necessarily mean that developers will game them. I'd
    say it depends on the context and how strong the incentives are. But one
    thing is certain - developers will realize that the measure of their
    productivity is disconnected from what matters. This is not only
    frustrating. It also distracts them from doing the real work.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="but-why">
    <a href="#but-why">But why?</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    Why do metrics work so well for software products, and not for measuring
    developer output? Is it some kind of developer conspiracy? Actually, if you
    look outside of software development, you'll find more examples where
    metrics work well, and where they don't.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Where metrics work well:</b> manufacturing and sales. Let's take the
    manufacture and sale of cups. You can measure production output, i.e. no.
    of cups produced per unit of time, and production quality — percentage of
    cups that failed to pass quality control. On the sales side, you can
    measure sales volume and profit margin. These metrics are really helpful
    for management. For example, the goal for the manufacturing department can
    be to improve the percentage of cups that successfully pass quality control,
    while keeping unit costs low. The head of sales can aim to increase sales
    volume or improve profit margins. Improvements in these metrics are good
    for business, so we can also treat them as a measure of efficiency of
    corresponding departments.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Where metrics don't work:</b> measuring scientific output. Scientists
    publish their research in articles. Now science also has some metrics that
    measure work output and quality: no. of articles published, no. of
    citations, statistical significance of the results. Can we say that a
    scientist who published 10 articles has produced twice as much value as a
    scientist who published 5? Unlikely. Works differ too much in their value.
    Even without numbers, it's often hard to say which work is more valuable.
    Because "hacking" one's number of publications  and citations is a
    well-known problem in the scientific community, they're not considered
    reliable indicators of work productivity. Statistical significance has its
    own issues too -
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42QuXLucH3Q" target="_blank">
      p-hacking is a wide-spread problem</a>.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="two-key-criteria">
    <a href="#two-key-criteria">Two key criteria</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    In any context, metrics that work well share two important criteria:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      They relate directly to value;
    </li>
    <li>
      These values are consistent, i.e. in countable quantities of
      interchangeable units.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Let's take a look at the examples above:
  </p>

  <p>
    Metrics in manufacturing and sales satisfy both criteria. In cups
    manufacturing, value is represented in cups. Since it's mass produced,
    cups are identical. In sales, value is measured in dollars. The business
    goal is to make money, so money's relationship with business value is as
    direct as possible. As one dollar is equal to any other, metrics based on
    money measure consistent values.
  </p>

  <p>
    In science, these criteria aren't satisfied. We can't find a metric that
    would measure the value of scientific results directly. We have only
    indirect metrics, like no. of articles and citations, which can be hacked.
    In any case, these metrics aren't consistent either, because all
    publications are not made of interchangeable units.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="developer-metrics-fail-both-criteria">
    <a href="#developer-metrics-fail-both-criteria">Developer metrics fail both criteria</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    What do we have to measure developer output? Lines of code, no. of commits,
    no. of tasks completed, man-hours, storypoints… Considering these metrics
    against the two key criteria above, you'll find that:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      None of them relate directly to value. We don't ship our customers lines
      of code, man-hours, or storypoints. They don't care how many commits we
      made or how many tasks we completed;
    </li>
    <li>
      All these measurements are inconsistent. One commit is not equal to
      another, one line of code is not as valuable as the other line, all tasks
      are also different, and man-hours and storypoints are based on estimates,
      which are by definition inaccurate.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    It's no surprise that none of these metrics work well.
  </p>

  <p>
    Why don't we have metrics for developers that would relate directly to
    value? For the same reason we don't have any for scientists. Developers,
    just like scientists, always create something new. They don't write the
    same code again and again — that wouldn't make sense. Code can be re-used
    in a variety of ways — you can either extract it to a module or a library,
    or, as a last resort, just copy and paste it. Every developers' workday is
    unique. Even if they solve similar problems, they solve them in a different
    context, or a new way, each time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Why don't we have metrics for developers that would relate directly to
    value? For the same reason we don't have any for scientists. Developers,
    just like scientists, always create something new. They don't write the
    same code again and again — that wouldn't make sense. Code can be re-used
    in a variety of ways — you can either extract it to a module or a library,
    or, as a last resort, just copy and paste it. Every developers' workday is
    unique. Even if they solve similar problems, they solve them in a different
    context, or a new way, each time.

    Of course, no one today seriously talks about measuring developers' output
    in lines of code. There should be something more modern, right?

    The book <i>Accelerate</i> from 2018 presents research on 2000
    organizations of different sizes. The research goal was to identify which
    metrics would differentiate high performers from low. Here's what they
    found:

    We can see four metrics here. Let's see how these metrics relate to value,
    and whether they're consistent:

    <li>
      <b>Deployment frequency</b> - I can see why it's listed here. The more
      frequently you ship to production, the more reliable the shipping process
      becomes. Productive teams tend to ship code more frequently. However,
      correlation doesn't imply causation. It's not directly related to
      customer value. People want a product that satisfies their needs, not a
      product that changes as frequently as possible. The metric is also
      inconsistent, because one change shipped to production is not equal to
      another.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Lead time</b> - the time for satisfying customer requests. This one
      relates more closely to value, because we're talking about the changes
      customers have asked for. However, it's not a metric with consistent
      units, because requests are not equal to each other. Some might be
      simple, and …</li></ul></div></div></div>

<p>Some time ago, I wrote a blog post about how <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2018/07/24/pointers-and-bytes.html">there’s more to a pointer than meets the eye</a>.
One key point I was trying to make is that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>just because two pointers point to the same address, does not mean they are equal in the sense that they can be used interchangeably.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This “extra information” that distinguishes different pointers to the same address is typically called <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/unsafe-code-guidelines/glossary.html#pointer-provenance"><em>provenance</em></a>.
This post is another attempt to convince you that provenance is “real”, by telling a cautionary tale of what can go wrong when provenance is not considered sufficiently carefully in an optimizing compiler.
The post is self-contained; I am not assuming that you have read the first one.
There is also a larger message here about how we could prevent such issues from coming up in the future by spending more effort on the specification of compiler IRs.</p>

<!-- MORE -->

<p>Below, I will show a series of three compiler transformations that each seem “intuitively justified”, but when taken together they lead to a clearly incorrect result.
I will use LLVM for these examples, but the goal is not to pick on LLVM—other compilers suffer from similar issues.
The goal is to convince you that to build a correct compiler for languages permitting unsafe pointer manipulation such as C, C++, or Rust,
we need to take IR semantics (and specifically provenance) more seriously.
I use LLVM for the examples because it is particularly easy to study with its single, extensively-documented IR that a lot of infrastructure evolved around.
Let’s get started!</p>

<h2 id="warm-up-why-irs-need-a-precise-semantics">Warm-up: Why IRs need a precise semantics</h2>

<p>As a warm-up, I will give a simple example showing that compiler IRs such as LLVM IR need a precise (and precisely documented) semantics.
If you are already familiar with the idea of treating compiler IRs as proper programming languages in their own right, or if you are just here for the pointers and their provenance, you can skip to the next section.</p>

<p>Consider the following simple (and contrived, for the sake of this example) piece of C code computing <code>n * (i+j)</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>int</span> <span>sum_up</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>j</span><span>,</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>i</span> <span>+</span> <span>j</span><span>;</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>-=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>One transformation the compiler might want to do is to move the addition <code>i+j</code> out of the loop, to avoid computing the sum each time around the loop (this is called “loop-invariant code motion”<sup id="fnref:loop" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:loop">1</a></sup>):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>int</span> <span>sum_up</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>j</span><span>,</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>// optimized version</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span> <span>+</span> <span>j</span><span>;</span>
  <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>-=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>However, that transformation is actually incorrect.
If we imagine a caller using this function as <code>sum_up(INT_MAX, 1, 0)</code>, then this is a perfectly correct way to call <code>sum_up</code>: the loop is never entered, so the overflowing addition <code>INT_MAX+1</code> is never performed.
However, after the desired optimization, the program now causes a signed integer overflow, which is UB (Undefined Behavior) and thus May Never Happen!</p>

<p>One might be tempted to ignore this problem because the UB on integer overflow is a compiler-only concept; every target supported by the compiler will do the obvious thing and just produce an overflowing result.
However, there might be other compiler passes running after the optimization we are considering.
One such pass might inline <code>sum_up</code>, and another pass might notice the <code>INT_MAX+1</code> and replace it by <code>unreachable</code> since UB code is “by definition” unreachable, and another pass might then just remove all our code since it is unreachable.
Each of these passes has a good reason to exist (it can help real code become a lot faster or help prune dead code), but if we combine them all with loop-invariant code motion, the result is a disaster.</p>

<p>One way (and the only systematic way I know) to avoid such problems is to make sure that we can justify the correctness of each optimization <em>in isolation</em>.
Each optimization must be <em>correct</em> for any possible program, where <em>correct</em> means that the optimized program must only “do things” that the original program could have done as well.
(This is basically the “as-if” rule in the C standard, and is typically called “refinement” in the academic literature.)
In particular, no optimization must ever introduce UB into a UB-free program.</p>

<p>It may seem now that under this premise, it is impossible to perform the loop-invariant code motion we are considering.
But that is not the case!
So far, what we have seen is that the optimization is not <em>correct</em> when being performed on a C program.
But when LLVM performs these optimizations, it does not consider the program to be written in C—it considers the program to be written in LLVM IR, which has a different semantics than C.
Specifically, the <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html">LLVM LangRef</a> says that signed integer overflow in LLVM IR yields a <code>poison</code> value.
It is not UB to produce <code>poison</code>, it is just UB to use <code>poison</code> in certain ways (the details of this do not matter here).
In a call to the optimized <code>sum_up(INT_MAX, 1, 0)</code>, the <code>s</code> variable introduced by loop-invariant code motion is unused, so the fact that its value is <code>poison</code> does not matter!</p>

<p>Due to this behavior of signed integer overflow, this case of loop-invariant code motion is <em>correct</em> if we consider it as an optimization on programs that are written in LLVM IR.<sup id="fnref:cheat" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cheat">2</a></sup>
The “price” we pay for this is that replacing <code>INT_MAX+1</code> by <code>unreachable</code> is not <em>correct</em> in LLVM IR, since it is not UB.</p>

<p>The great thing about <em>correct</em> optimizations is that we can combine any number of them in any order (such as inlining, replacing definite UB by <code>unreachable</code>, and removing unreachable code), and we can be sure that the result obtained after all these optimizations is a correct compilation of our original program.
(In the academic lingo, we would say that “refinement is transitive”.)</p>

<p>However, to make the argument that an optimization is <em>correct</em>, the exact semantics of LLVM IR (what the behavior of all possible programs is and when they have UB) needs to be documented.
All involved optimizations need to exactly agree on what is and is not UB, to ensure that whatever code they produce will not be considered UB by a later optimization.
This is exactly what we also expect from the specification of a programming language such as C, which is why I think we should consider compiler IRs as proper programming languages in their own right, and specify them with the same diligence as we would specify “normal” languages.<sup id="fnref:ub-difference" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ub-difference">3</a></sup>
Sure, no human is going to write many programs in LLVM IR, so their syntax barely matters, but clang and rustc produce LLVM IR programs all the time, and as we have seen understanding the exact rules governing the behavior of programs is crucial to ensuring that the optimizations LLVM performs do not change program behavior.</p>

<p><em>Take-away:</em> If we want to be able to justify the correctness of a compiler in a modular way, considering only one optimization at a time, we need to perform these optimizations in an IR that has a precise specification of all aspects of program behavior, including UB.
Then we can, for each optimization separately, consider the question: does the optimization ever change program behavior, and does it ever introduce UB into UB-free programs?
For a <em>correct</em> optimization, the answer to these questions is “no”.</p>

<h2 id="how-3-seemingly-correct-optimizations-can-be-incorrect-when-used-together">How 3 (seemingly) correct optimizations can be incorrect when used together</h2>

<p>With the warm-up done, we are now ready to consider some more tricky optimizations, which we will use to explore the question of how precise a language specification needs to be.
We will look at three different optimizations LLVM can perform, and I will show that they <em>cannot all be correct</em> since the first and last program we are considering actually have <em>different behavior</em>.
(More precisely: the last program has a possible behavior that was not possible for the first program.)
This is only possible if at least one optimization changed program behavior in an incorrect way, but it is actually not entirely clear which optimization is the culprit.</p>

<p>The sequence of examples is taken from <a href="https://sf.snu.ac.kr/llvmtwin/files/presentation.pdf#page=32">this talk</a> by Chung-Kil Hur; it was discovered while working on a mathematically rigorous specification of LLVM.</p>

<p>Here is the source program:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> <span>p</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>q</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>};</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>ip</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)</span><span>q</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>iq</span> <span>==</span> <span>ip</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>*</span><span>(</span><span>char</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>q</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I am using C syntax here just as a convenient way to write programs in LLVM IR.</p>

<p>This program has two possible behaviors: either <code>ip</code> (the address one-past-the-end of <code>p</code>) and <code>iq</code> (the address of <code>q</code>) are different, and nothing is printed.
Or the two are equal, in which case the program will print “10” (<code>iq</code> is the result of casting <code>q</code> to an integer, so casting it back will yield the original pointer, or at least a pointer pointing to the same object / location in memory).</p>

<p>The first “optimization” we will perform is to exploit that if we enter the <code>if</code> body, we have <code>iq == ip</code>, so we can replace all <code>iq</code> by <code>ip</code>.
Subsequently the definition of <code>ip</code> is inlined:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> <span>p</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>q</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>};</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>ip</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)</span><span>q</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>iq</span> <span>==</span> <span>ip</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>*</span><span>(</span><span>char</span><span>*</span><span>)(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span> <span>// &lt;- This line changed</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>q</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The second optimization notices that we are taking a pointer <code>p+1</code>, casting it to an integer, and casting it back, so we can remove the cast roundtrip:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> <span>p</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>q</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>};</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>ip</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)</span><span>q</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>iq</span> <span>==</span> <span>ip</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>*</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span> <span>// &lt;- This line changed</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>q</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The final optimization notices that <code>q</code> is never written to, so we can replace <code>q[0]</code> by its initial value <code>0</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> <span>p</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>q</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>};</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>ip</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)</span><span>q</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>iq</span> <span>==</span> <span>ip</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>*</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span> <span>// &lt;- This line changed</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>However, this final program is different from the first one!
Specifically, the final program will either print nothing or print “0”, while the original program <em>could never print “0”</em>.
This shows that the sequence of three optimizations we performed, as a whole, is <em>not correct</em>.</p>

      <p><strong>Depression is a mental disorder that affects more than 264 million people of all ages worldwide. Understanding its mechanisms is vital for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Scientists from the Institut Pasteur, Inserm and the CNRS recently conducted a study showing that an imbalance in the gut bacterial community can cause a reduction in some metabolites, resulting in depressive-like behaviors.&nbsp; These findings, which show that a healthy gut microbiota contributes to normal brain function, were published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19931-2" target="_blank"><em>Nature Communications</em></a> on December 11, 2020.</strong></p>
<p>The bacterial population in the gut, known as the gut microbiota, is the largest reservoir of bacteria in the body. Research has increasingly shown that the host and the gut microbiota are an excellent example of systems with mutually beneficial interactions. Recent observations also revealed a link between mood disorders and damage to the gut microbiota. This was demonstrated by a consortium of scientists from the Institut Pasteur, the CNRS and Inserm, who identified a correlation between the gut microbiota and the efficacy of fluoxetine, a molecule frequently used as an antidepressant. But some of the mechanisms governing depression, the leading cause of disability worldwide, remained unknown.</p>
<p>Using animal models, scientists recently discovered that a change to the gut microbiota brought about by chronic stress can lead to depressive-like behaviors, in particular by causing a reduction in lipid metabolites (small molecules resulting from metabolism) in the blood and the brain.</p>
<p>These lipid metabolites, known as endogenous cannabinoids (or endocannabinoids), coordinate a communication system in the body which is significantly hindered by the reduction in metabolites.</p>

<p><em><span>© Pascal Marseaud</span></em></p>
<p>Endocannabinoids bind to receptors that are also the main target of THC, the most widely known active component of cannabis. The scientists discovered that an absence of endocannabinoids in the hippocampus, a key brain region involved in the formation of memories and emotions, resulted in depressive-like behaviors.</p>
<p>The scientists obtained these results by studying the microbiotas of healthy animals and animals with mood disorders. As Pierre-Marie Lledo, Head of the Perception and Memory Unit at the Institut Pasteur (CNRS/Institut Pasteur) and joint last author of the study, explains: "<em>Surprisingly, simply transferring the microbiota from an animal with mood disorders to an animal in good health was enough to bring about biochemical changes and confer depressive-like behaviors in the latter.</em>"</p>
<p>The scientists identified some bacterial species that are significantly reduced in animals with mood disorders. They then demonstrated that an oral treatment with the same bacteria restored normal levels of lipid derivatives, thereby alleviating the depressive-like behaviors. These bacteria could therefore serve as an antidepressant. Such treatments are known as "psychobiotics."</p>
<p>"<em>This discovery shows the role played by the gut microbiota in normal brain function</em>," continues Gérard Eberl, Head of the Microenvironment and Immunity Unit (Institut Pasteur/Inserm) and joint last author of the study. If there is an imbalance in the gut bacterial community, some lipids that are vital for brain function disappear, encouraging the emergence of depressive-like behaviors. In this particular case, the use of specific bacteria could be a promising method for restoring a healthy microbiota and treating mood disorders more effectively.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In its iPhone app, Spotify teaches you that swiping right on a song will queue that song. Queuing is great because it doesn't interrupt the song that's currently playing, or other songs you have queued.</p><p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_gd_XF5aiYM/X9eWhQQ9UlI/AAAAAAAFHOQ/pkLKjVFdBSQW7gvIIBH4PWl7PbCaqvnWgCLcBGAsYHQ/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-12-14%2Bat%2B11.43.53%2BAM.png"><img data-original-height="1064" data-original-width="1732" height="246" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_gd_XF5aiYM/X9eWhQQ9UlI/AAAAAAAFHOQ/pkLKjVFdBSQW7gvIIBH4PWl7PbCaqvnWgCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h246/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-12-14%2Bat%2B11.43.53%2BAM.png" width="400"></a></p><p>However, on the search results screen, you can't swipe right on songs. So imagine you are in the car, looking at your song, displayed basically the same as it's displayed on the album screen, where you can swipe right, but you cannot swipe right.</p><p>Worse, if you try to swipe right it will immediately play the song, interrupting your current song and queue. This has bitten me many times in the car, where carefully queued songs are hard-interrupted to play a song I meant to queue. It's jarring and annoying for driver and passengers alike.</p>

<p>See a demo of this behavior in this video:</p>

				<h2 id="i">I</h2><p>In this small addendum to my essay <em><a href="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/the-story-of-covid-19-in-sweden/">The Story of COVID-19 in Sweden</a>,</em> we want to look at a very surprising statistic: the number of annual deaths in Sweden.</p><figure><img src="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.13.38.png" alt="" srcset="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.13.38.png 600w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.13.38.png 1000w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.13.38.png 1402w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/525353/sweden-number-of-deaths/"><em>Number of deaths in Sweden from 2010 to 2020</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>You can find the original excel file published by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics_Sweden">SCB</a>—the official government agency for statistics in Sweden—<a href="https://www.scb.se/en/About-us/news-and-press-releases/statistics-sweden-to-publish-preliminary-statistics-on-deaths-in-sweden/">here</a>. The most striking aspect of these figures is, of course, the fact that there were no more deaths in Sweden this year than in any other year. (The year is not over yet, but it is almost impossible that the number of deaths will increase so much that 2020 will be a year with significantly more deaths.) And remember, Sweden did not have lockdowns nor mandatory mask laws.</p><h2 id="ii">II</h2><p>I got the idea to look at the Sweden’s annual deaths statistic because a friend of mine showed me the <a href="https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Querschnitt/Corona/_Grafik/_Interaktiv/woechentliche-sterbefallzahlen-jahre.html?nn=209016">same statistic for Germany</a>. In Germany, as in Sweden, the number of deaths this year is not higher than in other years, but for Germany, this fact could <em>theoretically</em> be explained by lockdowns and masks. Not so for Sweden.</p><p>Someone I showed these figures to suggested that although masks were not mandatory in Sweden, perhaps everyone wore them anyway. To me, this idea immediately sounded ridiculous, and it looks like I was right.</p><p><a href="http://www.coviddatahub.com/">A survey</a> asking participants whether they wore face masks in the last seven days to protect themselves from COVID-19 found that, for example, at the end of April, in the middle of the first COVID-19 wave, 82% of Swedes never wore a face mask. This is in stark contrast to, say, Germany, where only 8% did not wear a mask.</p><figure><img src="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.26.08.png" alt="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3034b31e-bf36-4d94-a52e-c9532b9465dc/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.26.08.png" srcset="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.26.08.png 600w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.26.08.png 1000w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.26.08.png 1440w"></figure><p>The latest survey—November 9. - 15.—tells the same story.</p><figure><img src="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_12.25.54.png" alt="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/668bfaf9-ce60-4785-85e8-88f20cad8fa1/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_12.25.54.png" srcset="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_12.25.54.png 600w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_12.25.54.png 1000w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_12.25.54.png 1428w"></figure><p>If you look at this statistic throughout the year, you will see that in Sweden, almost nobody wore face masks, while in Germany, almost everyone did. So what is going on here? How can they not wear masks without a high number of annual deaths? Where are those <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/sweden/">7,500 COVID-19 deaths</a>?</p><h2 id="iii">III</h2><p>To get a better picture of what happened in Sweden, we need to look at the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1115707/sweden-number-of-deaths-per-week/">weekly number of deaths</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_13.23.47.png" alt="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3af0303f-5d7a-4975-8ac0-2900d83b954b/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_13.23.47.png" srcset="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_13.23.47.png 600w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_13.23.47.png 1000w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_13.23.47.png 1342w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1115707/sweden-number-of-deaths-per-week/"><em>Average daily number of deaths per week in Sweden in 2020, compared to the average daily number of deaths per week from 2015 to 2019</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>As you can see here, the first half of 2020 was an exceptionally deadly year. After that, and especially now, Sweden compares favorably with other years.</p><p>My explanation for this is simple: most people who would normally have died in the winter from viruses and diseases—especially the flu—died in the spring from COVID-19. This can happen because the groups at risk from these viruses appear to be similar. However, for my explanation to be true, (1) the number of influenza deaths in Sweden would have to be lower than in other years, and (2) COVID-19 would have to have a case-fatality rate (CFR) that is in the ballpark of influenza.</p><p>Requirement number one fits the data from other countries like the U.S., where flu deaths have dropped by two-thirds, as this New York Post article titled <em><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/24/drop-in-flu-deaths-may-indicate-that-most-at-risk-died-from-covid-19/">Drop in flu deaths may indicate that most at risk died from COVID-19</a></em> states:</p><blockquote>Flu deaths are down two-thirds from the five-year average, a drop that could indicate the most vulnerable Americans died in the first wave of COVID-19.</blockquote><p>If anyone can find good data on the number of deaths from influenza and other diseases for 2020 in Sweden, I would greatly appreciate a comment or Twitter DM.</p><p>Condition number two—the low CFR—is something I discussed in my other <a href="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/the-story-of-covid-19-in-sweden/">essay</a>. It is still not clear how deadly COVID-19 really is, but estimates are getting lower every time new data comes in, so I do not think this is unlikely.</p><h2 id="iv">IV</h2><p>Whatever the explanation for the low number of annual deaths, it seems that Sweden has done “fine” without lockdowns and masks. Something I think few people would have expected, given how things are portrayed in the media—but that's a different essay. If you have another, perhaps better, explanation for these figures, feel free to suggest it in the comments.</p><p>And as always, thank you for reading my essay.</p>

            <p>The Program audio series is a fiction podcast I write, direct, edit, and produce. Fans have described it as “love child of Black Mirror and NPR”. It’s made on zero budget and has so far received over 130,000 downloads.</p>

            <p>
                <img alt="" src="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results-2/images/1.jpg">
            </p>

            <p>I described how The Program came to be and how it launched in <a href="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results/">my first blog post</a> back in April, so if you’re an aspiring podcaster make sure you check out the first instalment as well. We’re picking up where that article left off - and just like last time, mistakes made &amp; lessons learned are in <strong>bold</strong>.</p>

            <h3>US store feature</h3>

            <p>Hands down, the most important promotional vehicle for The Program so far has been Apple Podcasts. In the first 6 months since The Program’s release, they featured the show in 5 countries - Canada, Australia &amp; New Zealand, and the UK &amp; Ireland. Then in June I finally obtained the jewel in the crown - no, not India, but a spotlight in Apple Podcasts US. Noticing that The Program hadn’t been included in their newly established “Immersive Fiction” category, I notified Apple’s partner for Canada of the travesty. With tensions between the US and Canada already running high because of the steel tariffs, the matter was brought directly to Trudeau and Trump, and a compromise was soon reached: The Program will be listed as the number 1 show in “Immersive Fiction”, and Canada will concede their security council seat at the UN.</p>

            <p>
                <img alt="" src="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results-2/images/2.jpg">
            </p>

            <p>Having been featured for almost 6 months now, I’m quite confident that at least half of my daily downloads is attributable to the giant from Cupertino. Spotify however remains elusive, so if anybody reading this can lend a good word please <a href="mailto:ims@programaudioseries.com">contact me</a> and help avert another international crisis.</p>

            <h3>Change of hosting</h3>

            <p>Earlier this year, my hosting provider <a href="https://www.whooshkaa.com/">Wooshkaa</a> changed their strategy and decided to cater to established podcasting partners - which makes sense seeing that they provide power features such as IAB certification. However, for me this meant my hosting charges would go from zero to $100 per month, which just didn’t make sense seeing that The Program’s still a money-losing operation (turns out audio drama is not the most lucrative of fields - if this were a Medium post, it’d be the highlighted section).</p>

            <p>So I switched to <a href="https://redcircle.com/">RedCircle</a>, <strong>a podcast host that’s not only free, but also boasts cool extra features</strong> such as built-in capability to accept listener donations, cross-promotion with other shows, and dynamically inserted ads - a feature I haven’t taken advantage of yet, but which brings us to a topic that seems to be quite popular.</p>

            <h3>Monetization</h3>

            <p>More than one person has asked me why I haven’t mentioned the monetary aspect in my first article (two - it was two persons). The answer is simple: back then there was no monetary aspect to talk about. At the time, the only way to support the show was to chip in a few bucks at <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/">buymeacoffee.com</a> - a service which seemed like an affable alternative to Patreon. However, as the builders of our civilization remarked, nomen est omen - while I was able to get a bit recurring revenue on buymeacoffee, most people treated it as a tip jar. Which is perfectly fine, since my motivation for making The Program was and is deeply intrinsic. I was becoming aware however, that in order for the show to grow I had to start generating at least some income from it - if only to compensate my collaborators who contribute their time and energy into the endeavour.</p>

            <p>So at the end of September I introduced <a href="https://programaudioseries.com/support/">five more ways to give to the show</a> with the promise of bonus material to supporters (one mini-episode and two alternative endings that were previously available to everybody). Here are the results:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://liberapay.com/Program/">Liberapay</a>: crickets</li>
                <li>Bitcoin: 1 donation sent from a friend to test the wallet</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/programaudioseries">Paypal</a>: 2 donations</li>
                <li>Interac: 3 donations</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.patreon.com/programaudioseries">Patreon</a>: 29 patrons pledging $125 per month</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Which goes to show that <strong>Patreon is king</strong>. Which stupefies me, because for the life of me I don’t see what’s so special about it - as far as I can tell, people don’t use Patreon to find new content, meaning the service itself is not bringing me subscribers. Sure, I guess it’s true Patreon was the first site that successfully attracted people with disposable income and persuaded them to financially support content creators. But to now take a 20% cut in perpetuity (which is how much payment, platform, and payout fees deduct) seems like pure rent-seeking to me. This, combined with the fact that all these platforms are accountable only to themselves, is why I’m strategically building a relationship with my patrons exclusively through email, which is how I dispense bonus content (until a Silicon Valley company inevitably figures out how to insert themselves between people’s emails in order to extract profit).</p>

            <p>One more way I tried to raise money for the show was by selling merch. I initially looked at <a href="http://teepublic.com/">Teepublic</a> for this, but ultimately opted for the <strong>combination of <a href="http://printful.com/">Printful</a> integrated with <a href="https://launchcart.com/">LaunchCart</a>, as it offered more customization and the ability to set my own profit margins</strong>. The result is The Program’s <a href="https://store.programaudioseries.com/">official store</a>, where I sold a whopping 4 items. However, I do feel like I’ve got myself to blame for that, as I don’t think I’ve done my best to create compelling products, and I plan to give it another go later on - but I’m definitely <strong>putting merch on hold until my audience grows much bigger</strong>.</p>

            <p>While I still haven’t inserted ads into the show (and at this point have no plans to), I was able to attract the show’s first sponsor: a lovely lad by the name of Boris and his company <a href="https://atlasauthority.com/">Atlas Authority</a> reached out and bought the show the recording equipment, allowing us to own the means of production and bringing the global class struggle one step closer to its end. Boris shrewdly realized that investing in the show now - while probably not making most sense from the strict numbers perspective - assures that his message will be heard in the years to come with exactly the kind of audience his Atlassian consulting company wants to attract. And if The Program crashes and burns, hey, at least they supported something that brings joy to people, versus giving money to Mark Zuckerberg. Speak of the devil...</p>

            <h3>Social media</h3>

            <p>Early on I made the decision not to promote The Program on any properties owned by Facebook, which probably hurts the show, but helps me live with myself. The two networks I am active on are Twitter and Reddit.</p>

            <p>The two couldn’t be more different. From my experience, Twitter is where the rich and the famous pontificate to the masses and no real communication takes place. Despite making original content for over a year now, I had little success either getting new listeners or building any sense of a community. I still post there but mostly because I enjoy making <a href="https://twitter.com/TheProgramAS/status/1274740157854466049">illustrated quotes</a> from the show and I don’t know where else to publish these. But my point stands that <strong>I do not recommend spending time on Twitter if your goal is to organically promote an audio drama</strong>.</p>

            <p>Being a part of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programaudioseries/">reddit</a> on the other hand has been nothing but pleasure. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgramAudioSeries/">The Program’s subreddit</a> facilitated some great discussions, allowed me to get valuable feedback, and most definitely promoted the show to new audiences. Especially valuable was the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/audiodrama/">r/audiodrama</a>, adeptly moderated by Hitch42, which is shaping into <strong>a must place to promote any audio fiction</strong>. I also gained quite a number of downloads from a post I was allowed to publish in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/">r/blackmirror</a> that compared the two shows (still waiting for someone to call Black Mirror “The Program you watch instead of listening to”).</p>

            <p>
                <img alt="" src="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results-2/images/3.jpg">
            </p>

            <p>I definitely shouldn’t forget to mention HackerNews crowd again, not only for being so kind to repeatedly upvote and promote The Program’s threads, but also for being a wonderful resource and a constant source of inspiration (incidentally, it also has an absolutely masterful moderator going under the moniker dang, offering further proof that mods are the secret ingredient to successful online communities).</p>

            <h3>Contributors</h3>

            <p>During the course of the year, my collaboration with <a href="http://christienledroit.ca/">Christien Ledroit</a>, a super talented musician (and incidentally a neighbour), grew ever more fruitful. Chris so far supplied music for five episodes, three of which he fully scored - in some cases actually facilitating the episode to transpire (for example, I wouldn’t have made <a href="https://programaudioseries.com/14-more-parrot-than-predator/">More parrot than predator</a> were it not for Chris who created the soundscape that comes alive in synch with the A.I. from the story). Chris is currently scoring three more episodes in various stages of production, so expect to hear many more of his fine works.</p>

            <p>The music that isn’t made specifically for the show mostly comes from <a href="https://www.neosounds.com/">Neosounds</a>, a royalty-free website I can <strong>absolutely recommend for the quality of their tunes and ease of use</strong>, and also because they have been generous enough to kindly extend the discount they provided to this poor producer (cost of music is the main reason the show is still not profitable even with the supporters and owning the equipment).</p>

            <p>On the visual side of things, the show’s artist <a href="https://en.cdacosta.art/">Carlos Costa</a> continues to amaze with his official illustrations, depicting three more episodes and creating new show art (which you can see at the top of the page).</p>

            <p>
                <img alt="" src="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results-2/images/4.jpg">
            </p>

            <p>While mentioning contributors, I would be remiss to not mention all the wonderful actors who have literally given The Program a voice. A lot of them became frequent collaborators and you can find out more about them not only in the show’s credits available at this website, …</p></div></div>

                    <p><a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/"><strong>S</strong>olarWinds</a>' credentials exposure from 2019 gives an important clue to how the breach at FireEye and US government possibly took place. It sheds light over a very important aspect that organizations often ignore – their insecure practices and inefficiency in securing credentials. <a href="https://savebreach.com/">SaveBreach</a> has identified weak credentials in hundreds of organizations over the course of years that we tested or, engaged in pentest with, and the <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/">SolarWinds</a> breach seems to be just another case of gross carelessness and weak credentials. Although not confirmed by official sources, this is what we can conjecture for now. This reveals a very important piece of the puzzle, that is &nbsp;the attack was possibly not as sophisticated as it was reported to be.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html">official blog post published yesterday</a>, FireEye said a "<em>highly evasive attacker </em>by <em>leveraging SolarWinds Supply Chain to Compromise Multiple Global Victims with SUNBURST Backdoor". </em>The original blog post from FireEye has been linked below</p><figure><a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html"><div><p>Highly Evasive Attacker Leverages SolarWinds Supply Chain to CompromiseMultiple Global Victims With SUNBURST Backdoor</p><p>We have discovered a global intrusion campaign, and we are tracking the actors behind this campaign as UNC2452.</p><p><img src="https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/brand/logos/fireeye.ico"><span>FireEye</span></p></div><p><img src="https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/fw/images/fireeye-2-color-square.png"></p></a><figcaption>FireEye article about the SolarWind breach</figcaption></figure><p><strong>H</strong>owever, a recent tweet from a <a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow">cybersecurity researcher</a> hints at the fact this compromise probably dates back to 2019, that is more than an year before the <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/">SolarWinds</a> and US government breach were reported, and the attacker might have been able to own their servers through very simple techniques.

December 14, 2020 | https://www.osohq.com/post/graphql-authorization-graphene-sqlalchemy-oso | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.osohq.com/post/graphql-authorization-graphene-sqlalchemy-oso">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>GraphQL has been seeing a rapid uptick in adoption.  It enables a more expressive interface between frontend and backend code by allowing developers to specify exactly what data is required to render a given page.  While there are numerous wins for frontend engineers, the backend team needs a different mindset.  Instead of writing route handlers that return a fixed set of data (or maybe a few variations), the backend team must write <strong>resolver functions</strong> which return portions of the dataset individually. </p>
<p>We've seen that many developers will apply route-level checks as a starting point for authorization in their applications.  A common pattern is using decorators or other route level guards that ensure a user meets certain requirements (the user is an admin, the user has a certain role, etc.) before the route code is run.</p>
<p>This approach is easy to get started with, but is typically not feasible in GraphQL.  There is one route in a GraphQL application, and the potential set of data returned is highly variable.  There are many more combinations of fields in a GraphQL query than the number of routes in a typical REST application.</p>
<p>Since GraphQL is oriented around access to individual data elements, a natural place to enforce authorization is during data access.  GraphQL's official documentation acknowledges as much:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where should you perform validation and authorization checks? The answer: inside a dedicated business logic layer. Your business logic layer should act as the single source of truth for enforcing <em>business domain rules</em> [emphasis added].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>– <a href="https://graphql.org/learn/thinking-in-graphs/#business-logic-layer">https://graphql.org/learn/thinking-in-graphs/#business-logic-layer</a></p>
<p>Great. Easy.  But how does that actually work?  How do we enforce a business domain rule? Is there a simple abstraction for specifying them?</p>
<p>In this post, we'll look at using oso—an open source authorization library—for enforcing authorization rules.  We'll see how to declaratively specify authorization rules in Polar, oso's policy language, and how to integrate oso into a GraphQL application in only a few lines of code.</p>
<p>We'll use SQLAlchemy as our ORM, and Graphene — a popular Python GraphQL library.  The <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/frameworks/sqlalchemy.html#installation">library</a> will provide the glue between oso, GraphQL and SQLAlchemy, allowing us to enforce authorization consistency.</p>

<p>We'll start with a basic Flask app representing an expense management application.  To follow along, <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-graphene-sqlalchemy-app">clone the project on GitHub</a>.  We'll walk through the parts of this app relevant to authorization, but the full code is available in the project. We'll assume some familiarity with Flask, SQLAlchemy and GraphQL.  Each section of this post is based on a commit in the repository, and we'll link to the relevant commit at the beginning of the section.</p>
<p>If you plan on following along and trying out the examples as you read, make sure to follow the <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-graphene-sqlalchemy-app/blob/main/README.md">README</a> to install the dependencies so you can run the code. This section covers the <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-graphene-sqlalchemy-app/tree/922af81fc265efc82f9572e174833689f051ae9a">initial commit</a>.</p>
<p>Our app has a few models:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expense:</strong> An expense created by a user.</li>
<li><strong>User:</strong> A user accessing the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll start with these, and add some more later.  Here are our initial models from <code>models.py</code>. These are regular SQLAlchemy models.  We used the <a href="https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/">flask_sqlalchemy</a> library to integrate with Flask and make our setup a bit easier.</p>
<pre><code>from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

db = SQLAlchemy()

class Expense(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'expenses'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    amount = db.Column(db.Integer)

    created_by_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('users.id'))
    created_by = relationship("User")

    description = db.Column(db.Text)

class User(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'users'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    email = db.Column(db.String(256))
</code></pre>

<p>An Expense is created by a user, available at the <code>Expense.created_by</code> property.</p>
<p>We also have a GraphQL schema defined using Graphene over these models in <code>app/schema.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import graphene
from graphene import relay
from graphene_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemyConnectionField, SQLAlchemyObjectType

from flask import g

from . import models

class Expense(SQLAlchemyObjectType):
    class Meta:
        model = models.Expense
        interfaces = (relay.Node,)

class User(SQLAlchemyObjectType):
    class Meta:
        model = models.User
        interfaces = (relay.Node,)

class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
    expenses = SQLAlchemyConnectionField(Expense.connection)
    user = graphene.Field(User)
    node = graphene.relay.Node.Field()

    def resolve_user(parent, info):
        return (g.current_user
                if isinstance(g.current_user, models.User)
                else None)

# ... snip ...

schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query)
</code></pre>

<p>This schema uses the <a href="https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/sqlalchemy/en/latest/">Graphene-SQLAlchemy library</a> to create Graphene schema objects for our SQLAlchemy models.  This is a <a href="https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/sqlalchemy/en/latest/tutorial/#defining-our-models">standard approach</a> for using SQLAlchemy with Graphene.</p>
<p>We can make a simple query (I'm using the awesome <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphiql">GraphiQL</a> tool for this, but you can also just go to <a href="http://localhost:5000/graphql">http://localhost:5000/graphql</a> in your browser) and see that our app is working:</p>
<p><img alt="Final%20d38ce8f758064d59a83b0e0d6ff6aa74/Screen_Shot_2020-12-08_at_6.14.44_PM.png" src="https://images.osohq.com/graphql-authorization-graphene-sqlalchemy-oso/Final%20d38ce8f758064d59a83b0e0d6ff6aa74/Screen_Shot_2020-12-08_at_6.14.44_PM.png"></p>
<h2>Adding authorization</h2>
<p>At this point, we have a basic GraphQL app, without authorization.  Let's set that up. Here's the <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-graphene-sqlalchemy-app/commit/8bf8c4a411f83e640fdd3537ddcc3d59049edecf">commit on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Our initial authorization rule will be based on the concept of data owners: <em>users can view their own expenses.</em></p>
<p>To implement this rule, we would need to perform filtering at the SQLAlchemy level. Which means:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding a custom resolver for Expense</li>
<li>Checking all other places the GraphQL schema might access expenses</li>
<li>Implementing the custom SQLAlchemy query</li>
<li>Repeating for every other model and authorization check.</li>
</ol>
<p>This authorization rule is based on each database record—sometimes referred to as object-level permissions.  It can be challenging to abstract as middleware, and is certainly more complex than just adding the simple decorator we discussed earlier. </p>
<p>Instead, we'll use the <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> library.  We need to make two changes to set this up:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add an instance of <code>Oso</code> to our application.</li>
<li>Write a policy containing our authorization rules.</li>
</ol>
<p>To add oso, we'll modify the <code>create_app</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>from oso import Oso
from sqlalchemy_oso import register_models

def create_app():
    # snip ...

    # Create oso instance which will hold our policy.
    oso = Oso()  
    # Make SQLAlchemy models available in the policy.
    register_models(oso, db.Model)  
    # Load policy file into oso.
    oso.load_file(Path(__file__).parent / "policy.polar")   

    # ...
</code></pre>

<p>Then, we swap out the <code>SQLAlchemy</code> object in our app with <code>AuthorizedSQLAlchemy</code>. In <code>models.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from sqlalchemy_oso.flask import AuthorizedSQLAlchemy

db = AuthorizedSQLAlchemy(
    get_oso=lambda: current_app.oso,
    get_user=lambda: getattr(g, "current_user", None),
    get_action=lambda: "read"
)
</code></pre>

<p>We use this object instead of <code>flask_sqlalchemy.SQLAlchemy</code>.  It provides a <a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/session.html">SQLAlchemy Session object</a> that filters queries to only return objects that are authorized for the current user and action.</p>
<p>Our policy file, <code>app/policy.polar</code> is empty for now.</p>
<p>Now, let's check our query results:</p>
<p><img alt="Final%20d38ce8f758064d59a83b0e0d6ff6aa74/Screen_Shot_2020-12-09_at_6.42.46_PM.png" src="https://images.osohq.com/graphql-authorization-graphene-sqlalchemy-oso/Final%20d38ce8f758064d59a83b0e0d6ff6aa74/Screen_Shot_2020-12-09_at_6.42.46_PM.png"></p>
<p>Nothing's returned anymore.  Why? The policy file is empty.  Polar is deny by default, so we'll need to add some rules.  Before we do that, let's take a look at how this is working.  Our app has an endpoint that will log the SQL used to execute our last query.  If you're following along, run the app with:</p>
<pre><code>$ FLASK_RUN_EXTRA_FILES=app/policy.polar FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run
</code></pre>

<p>Run a query in GraphiQL.  Below is a good starting point.</p>
<pre><code>{
  expenses {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        description
        createdBy {
          email
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now visit, <a href="http://localhost:5000/sql">http://localhost:5000/sql</a>.</p>
<p>Here, we see:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT count(*) AS count_1
  FROM (
        SELECT expenses.id AS expenses_id,
               expenses.amount AS expenses_amount,
               expenses.created_by_id AS expenses_created_by_id,
               expenses.description AS expenses_description
          FROM expenses
         WHERE 0 = 1
         ORDER BY expenses.id ASC
       ) AS anon_1
</code></pre>

<p>Notice our WHERE clause: <code>0 = 1</code>.  Where's that coming from? <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> enforces our Polar policy by translating rules from the policy into SQL filters.  <code>0 = 1</code> is always false, which causes no records to be returned from the database.</p>
<h2>Adding some rules</h2>
<p>Now that we have oso integrated, let's finish implementing our authorization rule.  Keep the app running, the <code>FLASK_RUN_EXTRA_FILES</code> environment variable we set will ensure that Flask reloads the app when you change the policy.</p>
<p>Let's try the following (in <code>app/policy.polar</code>):</p>
<pre><code>allow(_actor, _action, _resource);
</code></pre>

<p>This policy allows the user to access any object.  In Polar, each statement in the policy is called a rule.  The <code>allow</code> rule is a special rule that is used as the entrypoint to policies.  It has three arguments, the <strong>actor</strong> (who's making the request), the <strong>action</strong> (what the request will do), and the <strong>resource</strong> (what the request is operating over).  Our policy has one rule.  Each parameter starts with <code>_</code> which indicates an anonymous variable (one that matches anything because there are no constraints on it).</p>
<p>Rerun the query, and check out the SQL (Just refresh <a href="http://localhost:5000/sql">http://localhost:5000/sql</a>. You'll see a few statements there, I've picked out the primary SQL query used to resolve the GraphQL query):</p>
<pre><code>SELECT expenses.id AS expenses_id,
       expenses.amount AS expenses_amount,
       expenses.created_by_id AS expenses_created_by_id,
       expenses.description AS expenses_description
  FROM expenses
 WHERE 1 = 1
 ORDER BY expenses.id ASC
 LIMIT 4
OFFSET 0
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we see <code>WHERE 1 = 1</code>.  This is always true! As a result, everything's been returned.  </p>
<p>Let's go a little further:</p>
<pre><code>allow(_: User, "read", _: Expense);
</code></pre>

<p>This policy is saying all users can read all expenses. Again, the <code>_</code> denotes an anonymous or ignored variable, but the <code>: User</code> syntax is checking that the input data matches a specific type. In this case, the User and Expense models from our <a href="http://models.py/">models.py</a> file.</p>

<p>I was using Scrapy to crawl some websites and mirror their content into a new one and at the same time, generate beautiful and unique URLs based on the title, but the title can appear repeated! So I added part of the original URL in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base36">base36</a> as uniqueness guarantees.</p>
<p>In the <em>URL</em> I wanted the title without special symbols, only ASCII and at the end a unique and short inditifier, and part of the result of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">SHA-256</a> of the URL in <em>base36</em>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Within privacy circles, Glenn Greenwald’s <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters">2014 TED talk</a> titled “Why privacy matters” is considered required reading. One quote jumps out to nearly everyone ― including the live audience ― has to do with how Greenwald responds to people who don’t worry about privacy because they have nothing to hide.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I always say the same thing to them. I get out a pen, I write down my email address. I say, “Here’s my email address. What I want you to do when you get home is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts…[snip]”</p>

  <p>Not a single person has taken me up on that offer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He continues to explain why that is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And there’s a reason for that, which is that we as human beings, even those of us who in words disclaim the importance of our own privacy, instinctively understand the profound importance of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ending that thinking with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People can very easily in words claim that they don’t value their privacy, but their actions negate the authenticity of that belief.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I used to agree and echo the same point, mostly in jest. Some version of “then hand me your passwords” is even a popular comeback <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/search?q=%22nothing%20to%20hide%22&amp;restrict_sr=1">on Reddit</a> to the the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument">nothing to hide</a>” argument.</p>

<p>Over time, I’ve come to realize that the response does very little to actually understand where people are coming from, and to really explain to them <a href="https://whyprivacymatters.org/">why privacy matters</a>. Of course no one would hand me keys to their bank account just to prove a point. I won’t dissect the matter too much ― people much more qualified than me have been <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C48&amp;q=nothing+to+hide+argument&amp;btnG=&amp;oq=%22nothing+to+hide%22">doing so for years</a>.</p>

<p>One understated aspect of the “nothing to hide” argument has to do with how humans think of themselves in crowds. Much like in a busy city, people tend to think they are invisible; they are one in many. Everyone feels a sense of anonymity in large crowds. Individuals are surrounded, but not watched. They are not “important”.</p>

<p>I believe the same concept intrinsically causes an average person to suspend the need for privacy in the digital realm. I have nothing to hide, because no one is watching <em>me</em>. I am not “important”.</p>

<p>Up until the 1980s spying was very labor intensive and hard to scale. You could only spy on one person at a time. With the advent of <del>big data</del> digital data processing, falling prices of surveillance equipment, as well as dirt-cheap storage and compute technologies, that is no longer true. Through economies of scale, it is cheaper to monitor and spy on a hundred thousand people than on hundred people.</p>

<p>With the choice of privacy, we have the freedom to choose to be who we want; we are allowed to create identities we choose. The promise of the Internet and technology was to expand that choice even more. Every day, I see that promise reneged.</p>

<p>Recently, many apps including TikTok and LinkedIn were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/tiktok-and-53-other-ios-apps-still-snoop-your-sensitive-clipboard-data/">caught snooping</a> on clipboards on iPhones (data you cut or copy but may not have pasted anywhere else). Weirdly, they all claimed to have had the same bug. Even with all the might of the US government or the Soviet spying apparatus, accidentally spying on tens of millions of people’s thoughts was impossible until recently. Now, all it takes is an over-worked software engineer.</p>

<p>We all are creeped out when we see a car following us. I do not believe that at this time privacy advocates are doing a good job of explaining to normal people why digital surveillance is cause for concern. I believe their arguments are scattered, hard to parse, and still considered an artifact of the cypherpunk era. We can do a better job of talking about how knowledge, privacy, and power are interconnected, and how that balance of power has tipped largely against the general public.</p>

<p>We can do a better job of explaining why the promise of a better life through technology has been a lie, and that the cost is too high.</p>

<p>Now, I don’t think we need to be extremists about our privacy. Giving up some privacy is good under some circumstances ― sharing personal details with loved ones creates a more intimate bond, sharing some details with government health departments helps in contact tracing during a pandemic.</p>

<p>As we approach Christmas 2020, many Americans are being forced to decide how they will celebrate the holiday. The <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" title="CDC Website" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays/winter.html">CDC</a> has recommended postponing travel and staying home. It has also recommended using technology to host virtual gatherings.</p>
<p>But how likely are Americans to follow these guidelines and leverage technology to adapt to the pandemic? To find out, we surveyed 1,002 Americans. Below, we analyze the results of our two surveys, which were taken two weeks apart on November 23rd and December 7th.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Almost 30% of Americans Will Celebrate Christmas Virtually in 2020</h2>
<p>We surveyed Americans in November and December to find out how many will use software to celebrate Christmas virtually, and how many are moving forward with Christmas per usual. We found that 19.3% of Americans will celebrate Christmas all in person per usual, 43.0% will celebrate in-person, but with a smaller group, and 28.5% will celebrate virtually.</p>
<div>
<p><img alt="how Americans will celebrate Christmas 2020" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/softwarepundit/image/upload/c_limit,dpr_1.0,f_auto,h_1600,q_auto,w_1600/v1/software/main-christmas-2020-chart" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/softwarepundit/image/upload/c_limit,dpr_1.0,f_auto,h_1600,q_auto,w_1600/v1/software/main-christmas-2020-chart 1x, https://res.cloudinary.com/softwarepundit/image/upload/c_limit,dpr_2.0,f_auto,h_1600,q_auto,w_1600/v1/software/main-christmas-2020-chart 2x">
</p>
</div>
<p>In recent weeks, COVID-19 cases have spiked across the country. We compared our November and December surveys to understand how the increase in cases has impacted Christmas plans. Interestingly, the percentage of respondents who indicated that they would celebrate in-person per usual, and the percentage who indicated that they would celebrate virtually both increased. In contrast, the percentage who responded that they would celebrate in-person with a smaller group declined.</p>

</p>
</div>
<h2>Americans in Blue States are 33% More Likely to Go Virtual, Red States 16% More Likely to Celebrate In Person</h2>
<p>We grouped respondent results by state to explore if a state's political orientation has an impact on Christmas plans. Respondents in states that were won by Joe Biden in the 2020 election were 33% more likely to celebrate Thanksgiving virtually (p=&lt;.01)). In addition, Americans in states that were won by Donald Trump were 16% more likely to celebrate in person (p=&lt;.01).</p>

</p>
</div>
<h2>Older Americans Are Less Likely to Celebrate in Person</h2>
<p>Breaking results down by age shows that the youngest Americans are most likely to celebrate Christmas in person. 73% of respondents aged 18-24 plan to celebrate Christmas in person. This contrasts with only 59% of Americans over the age of 65 who plan to celebrate in person. Only 15% of Americans over 65 plan to celebrate in person per usual, which is the lowest percentage among any age group.</p>

</p>
</div>
<h2>Females Are Far Less Likely to Celebrate Christmas In Person Per Usual</h2>
<p>Analyzing our data by gender also revealed differences in Christmas plans. Females were 88% less likely to celebrate Christmas in person per usual (p=&lt;.001). In contrast, women were more likely to indicate that they plan to celebrate in person with a smaller group. There was no statistically significant difference between the percentage of men and women who plan to celebrate in person in any size group (i.e. per usual or with a smaller group).</p>

<h2>Americans Have Become More Likely to Celebrate Holidays Virtually as COVID-19 Hospitalizations Have Increased</h2>
<p>In the past three months, we have asked Americans about their holiday celebration four times –&nbsp;twice for Christmas, and twice for <a target="blank" title="Almost 20% of Americans Will Hold Virtual Thanksgiving in 2020" href="https://www.softwarepundit.com/industry-research/virtual-thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a>. As shown below, the percentage of Americans who indicated that they will celebrate holidays virtually has climbed as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations have increased.</p>

<h2>What Are the Most Popular Software Solutions for Virtual Christmas?</h2>
<p>Our research revealed the four most popular software tools for virtual Christmas to be Zoom, Facebook Messenger Rooms, Google Meet and Skype. Consumers trust that these popular and proven <a title="video conferencing tools" href="https://www.softwarepundit.com/mental-health/hipaa-compliant-video-conferencing">video conferencing tools</a> can be used reliably for larger groups during holidays. They are also more familiar with them compared to newer or niche video chat software.</p>
<h3>Zoom</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" title="Zoom Website" href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> went public in late 2019, and became a household name as a result of COVID-19. It is among the most popular video conferencing software in the market today. Zoom does offer a free plan, but group meetings can only last for 40 minutes. Zoom subscriptions start at $149.90 per year.</p>
<h3>Facebook Messenger Rooms</h3>
<p>Facebook launched <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" title="Facebook Messenger Website" href="https://www.messenger.com/rooms">Messenger Rooms</a> in April 2020. With this new feature, you can use Facebook or Messenger to create a room of up to 50 people. Other than being free, a major upside of Messenger Rooms is that there's no time limit on video calls, and you don't need a Facebook account to join.</p>
<h3>Google Meet</h3>
<p>Google offers its own free video conferencing solution, known as <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" title="Google Meet Website" href="https://meet.google.com/">Google Meet</a>. Anyone with a Gmail account can create meetings, and invite up to 100 people to meet for up to 60 minutes for free. For $8 per month, you can increase these figures to 150 people and 300 hours.</p>
<h3>Skype</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" title="Skype Website" href="https://www.skype.com/en/">Skype</a> is a popular video conferencing service that has been around since 2003. The Microsoft-owned company is still highly popular. It offers an attractive free plan that allows calls of up to 50 participants for up to 24 hours. Skype now works through any device with the Skype app or in any Internet-connected browser.</p>
<h2>Research Methodology</h2>
<p>To collect data, we conducted online surveys targeting a sample of all Americans physically located in the United States. 1,002 respondents were asked the multiple choice question "How will your family gather for Christmas this year?" Available answers were "All in person per usual", "In-person with a smaller group", "Virtually using a video call", and "Other." Answers were presented in a randomized order.</p>
<p>Detailed respondent data: </p><div>

That is their default behavior. </p><p>Ownership clearly applies to almost every aspect of our lives, but here I'm mainly talking about it from an engineering manager's point of view.

Is communicating how they did with their commitments a part of their sprint or quarterly planning? </li><li>Does the individual, team or organization care about bugs, system outages or other issues that cause production unreliability? It is important to clarify that this does not mean there are no bugs, or issues that cause system unreliability. It means that the team is resolving these issues quickly, or making big investments in reliability that may take a long time to roll out.

                <h2 id="dsla-x-elrond">DSLA x Elrond</h2>

<p>Dear community, <a href="https://stacktical.com/">Stacktical</a>, the core development team of the DSLA Protocol, is proud to announce that we have partnered with the <a href="https://elrond.com/">Elrond</a> network to launch DSLA Maxima “Elrond Edition”, a maximalist port of DSLA Protocol on the Elrond blockchain.</p>

<p>The first DSLA product helps validators and delegators on Proof of Stake networks reduce their mutual exposure to staking infrastructure risks, using decentralized service level agreements and two-way, self-settled compensation claims.</p>

<p>Our immediate collaboration will focus on adding Elrond Network validators information in the DSLA Ethereum-based smart contracts. Soon after, DSLA Protocol will be deployed as smart contracts on the Elrond Network, serving the same purpose but at higher speeds and lower costs, hence the “Maxima” codename.</p>

<p>In the long term, the DSLA core development team will leverage Elrond’s high throughput and inexpensive smart contracts execution platform to deploy a decentralized SLA framework suitable for digital services of any kind.</p>

<p>“Elrond has one of the largest validator networks in the PoS space and is a great addition to DSLA Protocol, and our flagship two-way hedge against staking and delegation risks. But the biggest value for us long term is its high throughput and inexpensive smart contracts execution capabilities, which we can leverage to settle SLAs in real-time, at internet-scale, for a wide variety of industries.” said Wilhem Pujar, Stacktical CEO.</p>

<p>The collaboration will bring additional adoption for the Elrond smart contract platform and provide an immediately useful tool for Staking Providers looking to increase the quality of their services.</p>

<p>“Today’s unexpected Google outage will likely cause tens of millions of dollars in losses to businesses worldwide. Automatically settling SLA breaches will increase the quality of online services and help avoid such situations. We’re happy to support this through our collaboration with Stacktical” said Beniamin Mincu, Elrond CEO.</p>

<h2 id="about-elrond">About Elrond</h2>

<p>Elrond is the internet-scale blockchain, designed from scratch to bring a 1000-fold cumulative improvement in throughput and execution speed. To achieve this, Elrond introduces two key innovations: a novel Adaptive State Sharding mechanism, and a Secure Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm, enabling linear scalability with a fast, efficient, and secure consensus mechanism. Thus, Elrond can process upwards of 15,000 transactions per second (TPS), with 6-second latency, and negligible cost, attempting to become the backbone of a permissionless, borderless, globally accessible internet economy.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Table of contents for this series of posts: “<a href="http://2ality.com/2017/11/about-reasonml.html">What is ReasonML?</a>”</p>
<hr>
<p>In this blog post, we look at <em>polymorphic variants</em>, which are a more flexible version of <a href="http://2ality.com/2017/12/variants-reasonml.html">normal variants</a>. But that flexibility also makes them more complicated.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>[Aside: this blog post was challenging to write and is based various resources on the web. Corrections and tips welcome!]</p>
<h2 id="what-are-polymorphic-variants%3F">What are polymorphic variants?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Polymorphic variants are similar to normal variants. The biggest difference is that constructors are not tied to types anymore; they exist independently. That makes polymorphic variants more versatile and leads to interesting consequences for the type system. Some of those consequences are negatives – they are the price you pay for the versatility.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the following normal variant and then turn it into a polymorphic variant.</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> rgb = Red <span>| <span>Green</span> | <span>Blue</span>;
</span></code></pre>
<p>The polymorphic version of <code>rgb</code> is defined like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> rgb = <span>[`R<span>ed</span> | `G<span>reen</span> | `B<span>lue</span>]</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>The constructors of a polymorphic variant must be wrapped in square brackets and their names must start with backticks followed by either lowercase letters or uppercase letters:</p>
<pre><code># `red;
- : [&gt; `red ] = `red
# `Red;
- : [&gt; `Red ] = `Red
</code></pre>
<p>As usual, types such as <code>rgb</code> must start with lowercase letters.</p>
<h3 id="polymorphic-constructors-exist-on-their-own">Polymorphic constructors exist on their own&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>You can only use a non-polymorphic constructor if it is part of a non-polymorphic variant:</p>
<pre><code># Int(123);
Error: Unbound constructor Int

# type data = Int(int) | Str(string);
type data = Int(int) | Str(string);
# Int(123);
- : data = Int(123)
</code></pre>
<p>In contrast, you can just use polymorphic constructors. There is no need to define them beforehand:</p>
<pre><code># `Int(123);
- : [&gt; `Int(int) ] = `Int(123)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>`Int(123)</code> has an interesting type: <code>[&gt; `Int(int) ]</code>. We’ll examine what that means later.</p>
<p>Polymorphic constructors existing on their own, enables using the same constructor more than once:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> color = <span>[`R<span>ed</span> | `O<span>range</span> | `Y<span>ellow</span> | `G<span>reen</span> | `B<span>lue</span> | `P<span>urple</span>]</span>;
<span>type</span> rgb = <span>[`R<span>ed</span> | `G<span>reen</span> | `B<span>lue</span>]</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>In contrast, with normal variants, you should avoid multiple variants within the same scope having the same constructor.</p>
<p>You can even use the same polymorphic constructor with different arities and/or type parameters:</p>
<pre><code># `Int("abc", true);
- : [&gt; `Int((string, bool)) ] = `Int(("abc", true))
# `Int(1.0, 2.0, 3.0);
- : [&gt; `Int((float, float, float)) ] = `Int((1., 2., 3.))
</code></pre>
<h3 id="extending-polymorphic-variants">Extending polymorphic variants&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>When defining a polymorphic variant, you can extend an existing variant. In the following example, <code>color</code> extends <code>rgb</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> rgb = <span>[`R<span>ed</span> | `G<span>reen</span> | `B<span>lue</span>]</span>;
<span>type</span> color = <span>[<span>rgb</span> | `O<span>range</span> | `Y<span>ellow</span> | `P<span>urple</span>]</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, case matters here: <code>rgb</code> being lowercased indicates that its constructors are inserted.</p>
<p>Extending multiple variants is also possible:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> red = <span>[ `R<span>ed</span> ]</span>;
<span>type</span> green = <span>[ `G<span>reen</span> ]</span>;
<span>type</span> blue = <span>[ `B<span>lue</span> ]</span>;
<span>type</span> rgb = <span>[ <span>red</span> | <span>green</span> | <span>blue</span> ]</span>;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-namespace-of-polymorphic-constructors-is-global">The namespace of polymorphic constructors is global&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The names of non-polymorphic constructors are part of their scopes (e.g. their modules), whereas the namespace of polymorphic constructors is global. You can see that in the following example:</p>
<pre><code><span>module</span> M = {
  <span>type</span> data = <span>[`I<span>nt</span>(<span>int</span>) | `S<span>tr</span>(<span>string</span>)]</span>;
  <span>let</span> stringOfData =<span> (<span>x</span>: <span>data</span>) =&gt;</span>
    switch x {
    <span>| <span>`Int(<span>i</span>)</span> =&gt;</span> <span>string</span><span>_of_int(<span>i</span>)</span>
    <span>| <span>`Str(<span>s</span>)</span> =&gt;</span> s
    };
};
<span><span><span>M</span>.</span></span><span>string</span><span>OfData(`Int(123)</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>In the last line, the parameter of <code>M.stringOfData()</code> is created via a constructor that is not from <code>M</code>’s scope. Due to the global namespace of polymorphic constructors, the parameter is compatible with the type <code>data</code>.</p>
<h3 id="type-compatibility">Type compatibility&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>How does ReasonML determine if the type of an actual parameter (function call) is compatible with the type of the formal parameter (function definition)? Let’s look at examples. We start by creating a type and a function whose single parameter is of that type.</p>
<pre><code># type rgb = [`Red | `Green | `Blue];
type rgb = [ `Blue | `Green | `Red ];
# let id = (x: rgb) =&gt; x;
let id: (rgb) =&gt; rgb = &lt;fun&gt;;
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we create a new type <code>rgb2</code> that has the same polymorphic constructors as <code>rgb</code> and call <code>id()</code> with a value whose type is <code>rgb2</code>:</p>
<pre><code># type rgb2 = [`Red | `Green | `Blue];
type rgb2 = [ `Blue | `Green | `Red ];
# let arg: rgb2 = `Blue;
let arg: rgb2 = `Blue;
# id(arg);
- : rgb = `Blue
</code></pre>
<p>Normally, the type of the formal parameter <code>x</code> and the actual parameter <code>arg</code> have to be the same. But with polymorphic variants, it’s enough if your types have the same constructors.</p>
<p>If, however, the type of an actual parameter <code>arg2</code> has less constructors, then ReasonML won’t let you do the function call:</p>
<pre><code># type rg = [`Red | `Green];
type rg = [ `Green | `Red ];
# let arg2: rg = `Red;
let arg2: rg = `Red;
# id(arg2);
Error: This expression has type rg but an expression was expected of type rgb
The first variant type does not allow tag(s) `Blue
</code></pre>
<p>The reason is that <code>id</code> makes precise demands on what it needs: <em>exactly</em> the constructors <code>`Red</code>, <code>`Green</code> and <code>`Blue</code>. Therefore, the type <code>rg</code> is not enough.</p>
<h4 id="from-concrete-types-to-type-constraints">From concrete types to type constraints&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Interestingly, the following does work:</p>
<pre><code># type rgb = [`Red | `Green | `Blue];
type rgb = [ `Blue | `Green | `Red ];
# let id = (x: rgb) =&gt; x;
let id: (rgb) =&gt; rgb = &lt;fun&gt;;

# let arg3 = `Red;
let arg3: [&gt; `Red ] = `Red;
# id(arg3);
- : rgb = `Red
</code></pre>
<p>Why? Because ReasonML didn’t infer a fixed type for <code>arg3</code>, it inferred the <em>type constraint</em> <code>[&gt; `Red ]</code>. This constraint is a so-called <em>lower bound</em> and means: “all types that have at least the constructor <code>`Red</code>”. This constraint is compatible with <code>rgb</code>, the type of <code>x</code>.</p>
<h4 id="type-constraints-for-parameters">Type constraints for parameters&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>We can also use constraints as the types of parameters. For example, the following call to <code>id()</code> fails, because the parameter’s type, <code>rgbw</code>, has too many constructors:</p>
<pre><code># type rgbw = [`Red | `Green | `Blue | `White ];
type rgbw = [ `Blue | `Green | `Red | `White ];
# id(`Red: rgbw);
Error: This expression has type rgbw but an expression was expected of type rgb
The second variant type does not allow tag(s) `White
</code></pre>
<p>This time, we call <code>id()</code> and specify the type <code>rgbw</code> of the parameter directly (no intermediate <code>let</code> binding). We can make the function call work without changing the function call, by only changing <code>id()</code>:</p>
<pre><code># let id = (x: [&gt; `Red | `Green | `Blue]) =&gt; x;
let id: (([&gt; `Blue | `Green | `Red ] as 'a)) =&gt; 'a = &lt;fun&gt;;
# id(`Red: rgbw); /* same as before */
- : rgbw = `Red
</code></pre>
<p>Now <code>x</code> has a lower bound and accepts all types that have at least the given three constructors.</p>
<p>You can also define constraints by referring to variants. For example, the following definition of <code>id()</code> is basically equivalent to the previous one.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> id =<span> (<span>x</span>: [&gt; <span>rgb</span>]) =&gt;</span> x;
</code></pre>
<p>We’ll take a deeper look at type constraints later on.</p>
<h2 id="writing-extensible-code-with-polymorphic-variants">Writing extensible code with polymorphic variants&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>One key benefit of polymorphic variants is that code becomes more extensible.</p>
<h3 id="the-type-and-code-we-want-to-extend">The type and code we want to extend&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>As an example, take the following type definitions for shapes. They are polymorphic versions of the example in <a href="http://2ality.com/2017/12/variants-reasonml.html">the preceding blog post</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> point = <span>[ `P<span>oint</span>(<span>float</span>, <span>float</span>) ]</span>;
<span>type</span> shape = <span>[
  | `R<span>ectangle</span>(<span>point</span>, <span>point</span>)
  | `C<span>ircle</span>(<span>point</span>, <span>float</span>)
]</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>Based on these type definitions, we can write a function that computes the area of a shape:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> pi = <span>4.0</span><span> *. </span>atan(<span>1.0</span>);
<span>let</span> computeArea =<span> (<span>s</span>: <span>shape</span>) =&gt;</span>
  switch s {
  <span>| <span>`Rectangle(`Point(<span>x1</span>, <span>y1</span>)</span>, <span>`Point(<span>x2</span>, <span>y2</span>)</span>) =&gt;</span>
    <span>let</span> width = abs<span>_float(<span>x2</span> -. <span>x1</span>)</span>;
    <span>let</span> height = abs<span>_float(<span>y2</span> -. <span>y1</span>)</span>;
    width<span> *. </span>height;
  <span>| <span>`Circle(<span>_</span>, <span>radius</span>)</span> =&gt;</span> pi<span> *. </span>(radius<span> ** </span><span>2.0</span>)
  };
</code></pre>
<h3 id="extending-shape%3A-a-failing-first-attempt">Extending <code>shape</code>: a failing first attempt&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Let’s say we want to extend <code>shape</code> with one more shape – triangles. How would we do that? We can simply define a new type <code>shapePlus</code> that reuses the existing polymorphic constructors <code>Rectangle</code> and <code>Circle</code>, and adds the constructor <code>Triangle</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> shapePlus = <span>[
  | `R<span>ectangle</span>(<span>point</span>, <span>point</span>)
  | `C<span>ircle</span>(<span>point</span>, <span>float</span>)
  | `T<span>riangle</span>(<span>point</span>, <span>point</span>, <span>point</span>)
]</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>Now we also need to extend <code>computeArea()</code>. The following function is our first attempt at writing that extension:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> shoelaceFormula =<span> (`P<span>oint</span>(<span>x1</span>, <span>y1</span>), `P<span>oint</span>(<span>x2</span>, <span>y2</span>), `P<span>oint</span>(<span>x3</span>, <span>y3</span>)) =&gt;</span>
  <span>0.5</span><span> *. </span>abs<span>_float(<span>x1</span><span>*</span>.<span>y2</span> -. <span>x3</span><span>*</span>.<span>y2</span> <span>+.</span> <span>x3</span><span>*</span>.<span>y1</span> -. <span>x1</span><span>*</span>.<span>y3</span> <span>+.</span> <span>x2</span><span>*</span>.<span>y3</span> -. <span>x2</span><span>*</span>.<span>y1</span>)</span>;
<span>let</span> computeAreaPlus =<span> (<span>sp</span>: <span>shapePlus</span>) =&gt;</span>
  switch sp {
  <span>| <span>`Triangle(<span>p1</span>, <span>p2</span>, <span>p3</span>)</span> =&gt;</span> shoelace<span>Formula(<span>p1</span>, <span>p2</span>, <span>p3</span>)</span>
  <span>| <span>`Rectangle(<span>_</span>, <span>_</span>)</span> =&gt;</span> compute<span>Area(<span>sp</span>)</span> 
  <span>| <span>`Circle(<span>_</span>, <span>_</span>)</span> =&gt;</span> compute<span>Area(<span>sp</span>)</span> 
  };
</code></pre>
<p>Alas, this code doesn’t work: In lines A and B, <code>sp</code>’s type <code>shapePlus</code> is not compatible with the type <code>shape</code> of <code>computeArea</code>’s parameter. We get the following error message:</p>
<pre><code>Error: This expression has <span>type</span> shapePlus
but an expression was expected <span>of</span> <span>type</span> shape
The second variant <span>type</span> does not allow tag(s) `Triangle
</code></pre>
<h3 id="fixing-computeareaplus-via-an-as-clause">Fixing <code>computeAreaPlus</code> via an <code>as</code> clause&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Thankfully, we can fix the problem by using the <code>as</code> clause for the last two cases:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> computeAreaPlus =<span> (<span>sp</span>: <span>shapePlus</span>) =&gt;</span>
  switch sp {
  <span>| <span>`Triangle(<span>p1</span>, <span>p2</span>, <span>p3</span>)</span> =&gt;</span> shoelace<span>Formula(<span>p1</span>, <span>p2</span>, <span>p3</span>)</span>
  <span>| <span>`Rectangle(<span>_</span>, <span>_</span>)</span> <span>as</span> r =&gt;</span> compute<span>Area(<span>r</span>)</span>
  <span>| <span>`Circle(<span>_</span>, <span>_</span>)</span> <span>as</span> c =&gt;</span> compute<span>Area(<span>c</span>)</span>
  };
</code></pre>
<p>How does <code>as</code> help us? With polymorphic variants, it picks the most general type possible. That is:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>r</code> has the type <code>[&gt; `Rectangle(point, point)]</code></li>
<li><code>c</code> has the type <code>[&gt; `Circle(point, float)]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these types are compatible with <code>shape</code>, the type of <code>computeArea</code>’s parameter.</p>
<h3 id="the-final-solution">The final solution&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>There is one more improvement we can make. Given the following variant:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> myvariant = <span>[`C1(<span>t1</span>) | `C2(<span>t2</span>)]</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>Then the following two patterns are equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>#myvariant
(<span>`C1(<span>_</span>: <span>t1</span>)</span> <span>| <span>`C2(<span>_</span>: <span>t2</span>)</span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>If we use the hash for the type <code>shape</code>, we get:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> computeAreaPlus =<span> (<span>sp</span>: <span>shapePlus</span>) =&gt;</span>
  switch sp {
  <span>| <span>`Triangle(<span>p1</span>, <span>p2</span>, <span>p3</span>)</span> =&gt;</span> shoelace<span>Formula(<span>p1</span>, <span>p2</span>, <span>p3</span>)</span>
  <span>| #shape <span>as</span> s =&gt;</span> compute<span>Area(<span>s</span>)</span>
  };
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s use <code>computeAreaPlus()</code> with two shapes:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> top = <span>`Point(3.0, 5.0)</span>;
<span>let</span> left = <span>`Point(0.0, 0.0)</span>;
<span>let</span> right = <span>`Point(3.0, 0.0)</span>;

<span>let</span> circ = <span>`Circle(<span>top</span>, 3.0)</span>;
<span>let</span> tri = <span>`Triangle(<span>top</span>, <span>left</span>, <span>right</span>)</span>;

compute<span>AreaPlus(<span>circ</span>)</span>; 
compute<span>AreaPlus(<span>tri</span>)</span>; 
</code></pre>
<p>We have therefore successfully extended both the type <code>shape</code> and the function <code>computeArea()</code> operating on it.</p>

December 14, 2020 | https://erikmcclure.com/blog/risc-is-fundamentally-unscalable/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://erikmcclure.com/blog/risc-is-fundamentally-unscalable/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, there was an announcement about <a href="https://twitter.com/Calista_Redmond/status/1154278392344305664">a new RISC-V chip</a>, which has got a lot of people excited. I wish I could also be excited, but to me, this is just a reminder that RISC architectures are fundamentally unscalable, and inevitably stop being RISC as soon as they need to be fast. People still call ARM a “RISC” architecture despite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture#ARMv8.3-A">ARMv8.3-A adding a <code>FJCVTZS</code> instruction</a>, which is “Floating-point Javascript Convert to Signed fixed-point, rounding toward Zero”. Reduced instruction set, my ass.</p><p>The reason this keeps happening is because <strong>the laws of physics</strong> ensure that no RISC architecture can scale under load. The problem is that a modern CPU is so fast that just accessing the L1 cache takes anywhere from <a href="https://www.7-cpu.com/cpu/Skylake_X.html">3-5 cycles</a>. This is part of the reason modern CPUs rely so much on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_renaming">register renaming</a>, allowing them to have hundreds of internal registers that are used to make things go fast, as opposed to the paltry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86#/media/File:Table_of_x86_Registers_svg.svg">90 registers actually exposed</a>, 40 of which are just floating point registers for vector operations. The fundamental issue that CPU architects run into is that <strong>the speed of light isn't getting any faster</strong>. Even getting an electrical signal from one end of a CPU to the other now takes more than one cycle, which means the physical layout of your CPU now has a significant impact on how fast operations take. Worse, the faster the CPU gets, the more this lag becomes a problem, so unless you shrink the entire CPU or redesign it so your L1 and L2 caches are <em>physically closer to the transistors that need them</em>, the latency from accessing those caches can only go up, not down. The CPU might be getting faster, but the speed of light isn't.</p><p>Now, obviously RISC CPUs are very complicated architectures that do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_RISC_pipeline#Hazard">all sorts of insane pipelining</a> to try and execute as many instructions at the same time as possible. This is necessary because, unless your data is already loaded into registers, you might spend more cycles <em>loading data from the L1 cache</em> than doing the actual operation! If you hit the L2 cache, that will cost you 13-20 cycles by itself, and L3 cache hits are 60-100 cycles. This is made worse by the fact that complex floating-point operations can almost always be performed faster by encoding the operation in hardware, often in just one or two cycles, when manually implementing the same operation would've taken 8 or more cycles. The <code>FJCVTZS</code> instruction mentioned above even <a href="https://community.arm.com/developer/ip-products/processors/b/processors-ip-blog/posts/armv8-a-architecture-2016-additions">sets a specific flag based on certain edge-cases</a> to allow an immediate jump instruction to be done afterwards, again to minimize hitting the cache.</p><p>All of this leads us to <strong>single instruction multiple data (SIMD)</strong> vector instructions common to almost all modern CPUs. Instead of doing a complex operation on a single float, they do a simple operation to many floats at once. The CPU can perform operations on 4, 8, or even 16 floating point numbers at the same time, in just 3 or 4 cycles, even though doing this for an individual float would have cost 2 or 3 cycles <em>each</em>. Even loading an array of floats into a large register will be faster than loading each float individually. There is no escaping the fact that attempting to run instructions one by one, even with fancy pipelining, will usually result in a CPU that's simply not doing anything most of the time. In order to make things go fast, you have to do things in bulk. This means having instructions that do as many things as possible, which is the exact opposite of how RISC works.</p><p>Now, this does not mean CISC is the future. We already invented a solution to this problem, which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_long_instruction_word">VLIW - Very Large Instruction Word</a>. This is what Itanium was, because researchers at HP anticipated this problem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itanium#Development:_1989%E2%80%932000">30 years ago</a> and teamed up with Intel to create what eventually became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itanium">Itanium</a>. In Itanium, or any VLIW architecture, you can tell the CPU to do <strong>many things at once</strong>. This means that, instead of having to build massive vector processing instructions or other complex specialized instructions, you can build your own mega-instructions out of a much simpler instruction set. This is great, because it simplifies the CPU design enormously while sidestepping the pipelining issues of RISC. The problem is that <em>this is really fucking hard to compile</em>, and that's what Intel screwed up. Intel assumed that compilers in 2001 could extract the instruction-level parallelism necessary to make VLIW work, but in reality we've only <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.02816.pdf">very recently figured out how to reliably do that</a>. 20 years ago, we weren't even close, so nobody could compile fast code for Itanium, and now Itanium is dead, even though it was specifically designed to solve our current predicament.</p><p>With that said, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mill_architecture">MILL instruction set</a> uses VLIW along with several other innovations designed to compensate for a lot of the problems discussed here, like having <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E4qs2irmpc&amp;t=26m45s">deferred load instructions</a> to account for the lag time between requesting a piece of data and actually being able to use it (which, incidentally, also makes MILL immune to Spectre because it doesn't need to speculate). Sadly, MILL is currently still vaporware, having not materialized any actual hardware despite it's promising performance gains. One reason for this might be that any VLIW architecture has a highly unique instruction set. We're used to x86, which is so high-level it has almost nothing to do with the underlying CPU implementation. This is nice, because everyone implements the same instruction set and your programs all work on it, but it means the way instructions interact is hard to predict, much to the frustration of compiler optimizers. With VLIW, you would very likely have to recompile your program for <strong>every single unique CPU</strong>, which is a problem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mill_architecture#Family_traits">MILL has spent quite a bit of time on</a>.</p><p>MILL, and perhaps VLIW in general, may have a saving grace with <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>, precisely because it is a low-level assembly language that can be efficiently compiled to any architecture. It wouldn't be a problem to have unique instruction sets for every single type of CPU, because if you ship WebAssembly, you can simply compile the program for whatever CPU it happens to be running on. A lot of people miss this benefit of WebAssembly, even though I think it will be critical in allowing VLIW instruction sets to eventually proliferate. Perhaps MILL will see the light of day after all, or maybe someone else can come up with a VLIW version of RISC-V that's open-source. Either way, we need to stop pretending that pipelining RISC is going to work. It hasn't ever worked and it's not going to work, it'll just turn into another CISC with a javascript floating point conversion instruction.</p><p>Every. Single. Time.</p></div></div>]]>

                    <p>I'm pretty impressed by what I've seen with Apple's M1 Chip. It's really fast and powerful for essential everyday tasks, which include browsing the web, working with Intel-based apps, and using programming apps. Yes – the ecosystem is moving, and that may take time, but I think M1 is worth paying for it because of its phenomenal performance.</p><p>M1 is fast, and many benchmarks have proved its performance. However, I was curious about the performance of the programming languages using M1. So I decided to test it for the most popular workloads here.</p><p>Before you see the results, you should know that some benchmark suites are memory-intensive, some are CPU-intensive, and some have no benefits with multi-core processing because of its overhead or its difficulty for utilizing. It means that M1 can have an advantage over the desktop-class multi-core Ryzen processor even though the core count is lesser. <strong>Most importantly, I've focused more on real-world development performance testing rather than synthetic, production tests.</strong></p><p>You can check the raw benchmark data <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g4U7LAImfEcXRihJbySZcRr32tn6WSWAtslfXltds58/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p><p>I add the following comment as of Dec 14: we care how fast our dev computer runs. the multi-core advantage of 3900X is useless for most of the benchmarks here that don't represent the real-world production performance at all but devs usually work on their laptops, desktops, etc most of the time so I think such real-world development performance benchmarks make it worthwhile though. of course, Ryzen 3900X will perform way better than M1 and Intel when it comes to production, mostly achieved by parallelizing.</p><h2 id="test-environment">Test Environment</h2><ul><li>Apple M1: Mac Mini (16GB RAM), MacBook Air (8GB RAM) / macOS Big Sur 11.0.1 (All executables used for benchmarks are natively compiled for Apple Silicon.)</li><li>Ryzen 3900X: ASRock Rack X570D4I-2T / 16GB DDR4-3200 x 2 / Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS (tested after shutting down background tasks.) – You may wonder why I used 3900X instead of Ryzen 5000-series CPUs: Because I don't have it.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
  
    <p>As we all know, Cyberpunk 2077 had a rocky start, but it’s not unexpected with a game of this scope.
It came to my attention that it’s been investigated that the game doesn’t take advantage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_multithreading">SMT</a> 
on AMD CPUs and that there’s a fix for it. While the discovery was legitimate and interesting,
it was quickly followed by misinformation and strong statements. In this post,
I’ll summarize my findings previously scattered around Reddit and <strong>try</strong> to clarify some of the statements.</p>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER: I tried to present those findings the best I could. However, it is not possible to be 100% certain about the choices made
by the dev team nor whether the fix is universally beneficial. You may rely on profiling data gathered from the community,
but only in-depth profiling of the game’s code can provide an indisputable answer. This is not something we can do.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>First of all, credits for finding this go to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/UnhingedDoork/">UnhingedDoork</a>
(aka <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BS_BlackScout/">BS_BlackScout</a>).
He dived into the game’s binary and found an interesting piece of code, checking via <code>cpuid</code> for the CPU vendor and some other
attributes (later revealed to be CPU family). That’s how this function looks in pseudocode (variables omitted for readability):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>sub_142A82270</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>sub_142A822F0</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>v17</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>v16</span><span>);</span>
  <span>cpuid</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
  <span>v13</span> <span>=</span> <span>_RDX</span><span>;</span>
  <span>v14</span> <span>=</span> <span>_RCX</span><span>;</span>
  <span>Str1</span> <span>=</span> <span>_RBX</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span> <span>strcmp</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>Str1</span><span>,</span> <span>"AuthenticAMD"</span><span>)</span> <span>!=</span> <span>0</span> <span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>v16</span><span>;</span>

  <span>cpuid</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
  <span>v10</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>_RAX</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>8</span><span>)</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>0xF</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span> <span>v10</span> <span>==</span> <span>15</span> <span>)</span>
    <span>v10</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>_RAX</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>20</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>15</span><span>;</span>
  <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>v17</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span> <span>v10</span> <span>==</span> <span>21</span> <span>)</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>v16</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The proposed fix neutralizes the <code>strcmp</code> check, making all CPUs take the <code>return v16</code> code path, previously taken only by Intel.
This very simple change reportedly can result in huge performance boosts on some configurations – while I haven’t been able to verify it myself,
reports came from various places and they generally seem great, with some people getting moderate gains while others getting huge speedups.
Do note, however, that there have also been reports of no performance increase, so this change should not be considered a “silver bullet for performance”.</p>

<p>Sadly, this great find quickly sparkled incorrect conclusions. I first learned of this issue from a topic named</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Cyberpunk 2077 used an Intel C++ compiler which hinders optimizations if run on non-Intel CPUs</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>which naturally caused people to come up with conspiracy theories. However, knowing that the Visual Studio compiler is pretty much an industry-standard
I’d be very surprised if this was true, so I dived and checked what this code truly is.</p>

<p>I originally posted my findings <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/kbsywg/cyberpunk_2077_used_an_intel_c_compiler_which/gfknein/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">on Reddit</a>,
and they are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>This check doesn’t come from ICC, but from <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/cpu-core-counts/blob/master/windows/ThreadCount-Win7.cpp#L69">GPUOpen</a>, a library from AMD which is also mentioned
in the game’s credits. Comparing the game’s function with the linked one reveals they are identical. There is no evidence that Cyberpunk uses ICC,
furthermore according to VirusTotal Visual Studio 2015 compiler has been used.</li>
  <li>With this knowledge, we can see that on non-Bulldozer AMD CPUs the function returns the number of physical cores, while for Intel and AMD Bulldozer chips it returns the number of logical cores.
With this change in place, the function returns the number of logical cores regardless of the CPU vendor.</li>
  <li>This function is used in numerous places, but most notably it is used in what appears to be an initialization function of the game’s job dispatcher system.
This value seems to drive a <code>MaxHWConcurrency</code> attribute, so in my opinion, it may be used e.g. to decide how many worker threads to spawn. This would at least explain higher CPU usage,
since this change most likely gives the game’s job system twice the amount of threads, thus distributing the work across logical cores more evenly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why was it done? I don’t know, since it comes from GPUOpen I don’t think this check is “wrong” per se, but maybe it should not have been used in Cyberpunk due to the way it utilizes threads.
Even the comment in this code snippet advises caution, after all. Again, <strong>we can’t know for certain</strong>, but in my opinion, this decision could have been made due to any of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>At some point, this change resulted in a performance boost but later changes and/or optimization may have made it less effective.</li>
  <li>Reportedly, this change helps AMD CPUs with one CCX unit and can make the game slower on CPUs with multiple CCX units. This code may have been tailored to only one type of CPU
and not the other.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly, I’d just like to highlight what <a href="https://gpuopen.com/learn/cpu-core-count-detection-windows/">AMD says about this GPUOpen functionality</a> (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our sample code, linked below, errs on the side of caution for our Ryzen processors and encourages you to profile: the <code>getDefaultThreadCount()</code> function draws attention to that fact, 
<strong>returning a starting default count equal to the number of physical processor cores on Ryzen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>It goes without saying that I cannot guarantee any improvements with this change applied, but you’re welcome to experiment.
Again, the original author of those instructions is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/kbp0np/cyberpunk_2077_seems_to_ignore_smt_and_mostly/gfkmc7d/?context=3">UnhingedDoork</a>
and I am only mirroring them here. Since I don’t have an AMD CPU, I cannot test those:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the EXE with HxD (Hex Editor).</li>
  <li>Look for a <code>75 30 33 C9 B8 01 00 00 00 0F A2 8B C8 C1 F9 08</code> hex string.</li>
  <li>Change it to <code>EB 30 33 C9 B8 01 00 00 00 0F A2 8B C8 C1 F9 08</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Alternately, you may try a <a href="https://github.com/yamashi/PerformanceOverhaulCyberpunk">PerformanceOverhaulCyberpunk</a> mod which applies those changes, similarly to my ASI-based mods.
Again, I have not tested this, so I cannot guarantee any improvements. Use with caution.</p>

<p>I have been working on porting GLIBC to the OpenRISC architecture.  This has
taken longer than I expected as with GLIBC upstreaming we must get every
test to pass.  This was different compared to GDB and GCC which were a
bit more lenient.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://lists.librecores.org/pipermail/openrisc/2020-May/002602.html">first upstreaming attempt</a>
was completely tested on the <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a> simulator.  I have
since added an FPGA <a href="https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex/blob/master/README.md">LiteX SoC</a>
to my test platform options.  LiteX runs Linux on the OpenRISC mor1kx softcore
and tests are loaded over an SSH session.  The SoC eliminates an issue I was
seeing on the simulator where under heavy load it appears the <a href="https://github.com/openrisc/linux/issues/12">MMU starves the kernel</a>
from getting any work done.</p>

<p>To get to where I am now this required:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixing buggy <a href="https://github.com/litex-hub/linux/commit/78969c54328e35b360d9452c7602f21107a13d22">LiteETH network driver</a>
in LiteX.</li>
  <li>Updating the OpenRISC GDB port to <a href="https://github.com/stffrdhrn/binutils-gdb/commit/9d0d2e9bef5c84caa7f05cc7ddba1e092e2b5120">support gdbserver</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/stffrdhrn/binutils-gdb/commit/82e99d5df56be3b18c63e613d00e2367fb5a78b7">native debugging</a></li>
  <li>Fixing bugs in the <a href="https://github.com/stffrdhrn/linux/commit/28b852b1dc351efc6525234c5adfd5bc2ad6d6e1">Linux Kernel</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/stffrdhrn/or1k-glibc/commit/75ddf155968299042e4d2b492e3b547c86d4672e">GLIBC</a> to get gdbserver and native support working</li>
</ul>

<p>Adding GDB Linux debugging support is great because it allows debugging of
multithreaded processes and signal handling; which we are going to need.</p>

<h2 id="a-bug">A Bug</h2>

<p>Our story starts when I was trying to fix a failing GLIBC <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_POSIX_Thread_Library">NPTL</a>
test case.  The test case involves C++ exceptions and POSIX threads.
The issue is that the <code>catch</code> block of a <code>try/catch</code> block is not
being called.  Where do we even start?</p>

<p>My plan for approaching test case failures is:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Understand what the test case is trying to test and where its failing</li>
  <li>Create a hypothesis about where the problem is</li>
  <li>Understand how the failing API’s works internally</li>
  <li>Debug until we find the issue</li>
  <li>If we get stuck go back to <code>2.</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s have a try.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-the-test-case">Understanding the Test case</h3>

<p>The GLIBC test case is <a href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=nptl/tst-cancel24.cc;h=1af709a8cab1d422ef4401e2b2d178df86f863c5;hb=HEAD">nptl/tst-cancel24.cc</a>.
The test starts in the <code>do_test</code> function and it will create a child thread with <code>pthread_create</code>.
The child thread executes function <code>tf</code> which waits on a semaphore until the parent thread cancels it.  It
is expected that the child thread, when cancelled , will call it’s catch block.</p>

<p>The failure is that the <code>catch</code> block is not getting run as evidenced by the <code>except_caught</code> variable
not being set to <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>Below is an excerpt from the test showing the <code>tf</code> function.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>*</span>
<span>tf</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>sem_t</span> <span>*</span><span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>static_cast</span><span>&lt;</span><span>sem_t</span> <span>*&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>);</span>

  <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>monitor</span> <span>m</span><span>;</span>

      <span>pthread_barrier_wait</span> <span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>b</span><span>);</span>

      <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
        <span>sem_wait</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(...)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>except_caught</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
      <span>throw</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So the <code>catch</code> block is not being run.  Simple, but where do we start to
debug that?  Let’s move onto the next step.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-hypothesis">Creating a Hypothesis</h3>

<p>This one is a bit tricky as it seems C++ <code>try/catch</code> blocks are broken. Here, I am
working on GLIBC testing, what does that have to do with C++?</p>

<p>To get a better idea of where the problem is I tried to modify the test to test
some simple ideas. First, maybe there is a problem with catching exceptions
throws from thread child functions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>do_throw</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>throw</span> <span>99</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>

<span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>*</span> <span>tf</span> <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>monitor</span> <span>m</span><span>;</span>
      <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>do_throw</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(...)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>except_caught</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>No, this works correctly.  So <code>try/catch</code> is working.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: There is a problem handling exceptions while in a syscall.
There may be something broken with OpenRISC related to how we setup stack
frames for syscalls that makes the unwinder fail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How does that work?  Let’s move onto the next step.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-the-internals">Understanding the Internals</h3>

<p>To find this bug we need to understand how C++ exceptions work.  Also, we need to know
what happens when a thread is cancelled in a multithreaded
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX_Threads">pthread</a>) glibc environment.</p>

<p>There are a few contributors pthread cancellation and C++ exceptions which are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>DWARF</strong> - provided by our program and libraries in the <code>.eh_frame</code> ELF
section</li>
  <li><strong>GLIBC</strong> - provides the pthread runtime and cleanup callbacks to the GCC unwinder code</li>
  <li><strong>GCC</strong> - provides libraries for dealing with exceptions
    <ul>
      <li><code>libgcc_s.so</code> - handles unwinding by reading program <strong>DWARF</strong> metadata and doing the frame decoding</li>
      <li><code>libstdc++.so.6</code> - provides the C++ personality routine which
identifies and prepares <code>catch</code> blocks for execution</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="dwarf">DWARF</h4>
<p>ELF binaries provide debugging information in a data format called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWARF">DWARF</a>.  The name was chosen to maintain a
fantasy theme.  Lately the Linux community has a new debug format called
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/728339/">ORC</a>.</p>

<p>Though DWARF is a debugging format and usually stored in <code>.debug_frame</code>,
<code>.debug_info</code>, etc sections, a stripped down version it is used for exception
handling.</p>

<p>Each ELF binary that supports unwinding contains the <code>.eh_frame</code> section to
provide unwinding information.  This can be seen with the <code>readelf</code> program.</p>

<p>We can decode the metadata using <code>readelf</code> as well using the
<code>--debug-dump=frames-interp</code> and <code>--debug-dump=frames</code> arguments.</p>

<p>The <code>frames</code> dump provides a raw output of the DWARF metadata for each frame.
This is not usually as useful as <code>frames-interp</code>, but it shows how the DWARF
format is actually a bytecode.  The DWARF interpreter needs to execute these
operations to understand how to derive the values of registers based current PC.</p>

<p>There is an interesting talk in <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~sergey/battleaxe/hackito_2011_oakley_bratus.pdf">Exploiting the hard-working
DWARF.pdf</a>.</p>

<h4 id="glibc">GLIBC</h4>

<p>GLIBC provides <code>pthreads</code> which when used with C++ needs to support exception
handling.  The main place exceptions are used with <code>pthreads</code> is when cancelling
threads.  When using <code>pthread_cancel</code> a cancel signal is sent to the target thread using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/tgkill.2.html">tgkill</a>
which causes an exception.</p>

<p>This is implemented with the below APIs.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=nptl/nptl-init.c;h=53b817715d58192857ed14450052e16dc34bc01b;hb=HEAD#l126">sigcancel_handler</a> -
Setup during the pthread runtime initialization, it handles cancellation,
which calls <code>__do_cancel</code>, which calls <code>__pthread_unwind</code>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=nptl/unwind.c;h=8f157e49f4a088ac64722e85ff24514fff7f3c71;hb=HEAD#l121">__pthread_unwind</a> -
Is called with <code>pd-&gt;cancel_jmp_buf</code>.  It calls glibc’s <code>__Unwind_ForcedUnwind</code>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=sysdeps/nptl/unwind-forcedunwind.c;h=50a089282bc236aa644f40feafd0dacdafe3a4e7;hb=HEAD#l122">_Unwind_ForcedUnwind</a> -
Loads GCC’s <code>libgcc_s.so</code> version of <code>_Unwind_ForcedUnwind</code>
and calls it with parameters:
    <ul>
      <li><code>exc</code> - the exception context</li>
      <li><code>unwind_stop</code> - the stop callback to GLIBC, called for each frame of the unwind, with
the stop argument <code>ibuf</code></li>
      <li><code>ibuf</code> - the <code>jmp_buf</code>, created by <code>setjmp</code> (<code>self-&gt;cancel_jmp_buf</code>) in <code>start_thread</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=nptl/unwind.c;h=8f157e49f4a088ac64722e85ff24514fff7f3c71;hb=HEAD#l39">unwind_stop</a> -
Checks the current state of unwind and call the <code>cancel_jmp_buf</code> if
we are at the end of stack.  When the <code>cancel_jmp_buf</code> is called the thread
exits.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s look at <code>pd-&gt;cancel_jmp_buf</code> in more details.  The <code>cancel_jmp_buf</code> is
setup during <code>pthread_create</code> after clone in <a href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=nptl/pthread_create.c;h=bad4e57a845bd3148ad634acaaccbea08b04dbbd;hb=HEAD#l406">start_thread</a>.
It uses the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/setjmp.3.html">setjmp</a> and
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/longjmp.3.html">longjump</a> non local goto mechanism.</p>

<p>Let’s look at some diagrams.</p>

<p><img src="http://stffrdhrn.github.io/content/2020/pthread-normal-seq.png" alt="Pthread Normal"></p>

<p>The above diagram shows a pthread that exits normally.  During the <em>Start</em> phase
of the thread <code>setjmp</code> will create the <code>cancel_jmp_buf</code>. After the thread
routine exits …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This post is also <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2020-11-18.md">available at my personal blog</a>.</p>
<p>Materialize allows you to maintain declarative, relational SQL queries over continually changing data. One of the most powerful features of SQL queries are <em>joins</em>: the ability to correlate records from multiple collections of data. Joins also happen to be one of the harder things to do both correctly and efficiently as the underlying data change.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through the ways that Materialize maintains queries containing joins!</p>
<p>In particular, we’ll see increasingly sophisticated join planning techniques, starting from what a conventional dataflow system might do, and moving through joins that can introduce nearly zero per-query overhead. Each of the new join plans we work through represent an implementation strategy that Materialize can do that other dataflow systems will struggle to replicate.</p>
<p>As we move through techniques, the number of private intermediate records maintained by each query dataflows drops. We’ll report all 22 TPC-H queries at the end, but here are two of the largely representative queries, and the number of <em>additional</em> records Materialize maintains to keep the query results up to date.</p>
<pre><code>|   query 03 |  query 08 | technique         |
| ----------:|----------:|------------------ |
|  4,173,794 | 7,111,507 | Baseline          |
|  3,416,347 | 6,142,311 | Primary indexes   |
|    174,571 |   141,228 | Secondary indexes |
|     23,240 |         6 | Delta queries     |
</code></pre>
<p>Each of these techniques are live in <a href="https://materialize.com/download">Materialize</a> now. Each comes on-line in response to indexes that you ask Materialize to prepare. The more prepared indexes, the less per-query memory required (admittedly, the more baseline memory required as well).</p>
<p>At the end, we’ll have a forward-looking <a href="#Joins-in-Materialize:-Late-Materialization">discussion of late-materialization</a> which can further reduce the memory requirements, in a way that currently requires user assistance (we’re working on it!). Throughout, the story is that Materialize can invoke efficient join patterns from relational databases in the context of scale-out dataflow processors.</p>
<h2>Introducing Joins</h2>
<p>Let’s take a super-simple example of an “equi-join”:</p>
<pre><code>-- Collect customer names and states of residence.
SELECT
    customer.name,
    location.state
FROM
    customer,
    location
WHERE
    customer.zip = location.zip
</code></pre>
<p>Here  we have two collection of data, <code>customer</code> and <code>location</code>. We want to pick out pairs from each that match on their <code>zip</code> field. Although we didn’t write the word <code>JOIN</code>, that is what happens in SQL when you use multiple input collections.</p>
<p>Most dataflow systems will plan this join using a relatively simple dataflow graph:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankmcsherry/blog/master/assets/joins/figure0.png" data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankmcsherry/blog/master/assets/joins/figure0.png" alt="" width="700"></p>
<p>Information about the <code>customer</code> and <code>location</code> collections flows in along their respective edges. For example, when records are added, removed, or updated, that information flows as data along an edge. The <code>join</code> operator receives this information, and must correctly respond to it with any changes to its output collection. For example, if we add a record to <code>customer</code>, the output must be updated to include any matches between that record and <code>location</code>; this probably means a new output record with the customer name and the state corresponding to its ZIP code.</p>
<p>Most dataflow systems implement the <code>join</code> operator by having it maintain its two inputs each in an index. As changes arrive for either input, the operator can look at their <code>zip</code> fields and immediately leap to the matching records in the <em>other</em> collection. This allows the operator to quickly respond to record additions, deletions, or changes with the corresponding output addition, deletion, or change.</p>
<p>The operator maintains state proportional to the current records in each of its inputs.</p>
<p>You may have noticed the  “most dataflow systems” refrain repeated above. Materialize will do things slightly differently, in a way that can be substantially better.</p>
<h2>Binary Joins in Materialize</h2>
<p>Materialize plans joins using a slightly different dataflow plan:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankmcsherry/blog/master/assets/joins/figure1.png" data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankmcsherry/blog/master/assets/joins/figure1.png" alt="" width="700"></p>
<p>We have broken the traditional <code>join</code> operator into three parts. Each of the inputs first visits an <code>arrange</code> operator, whose results then go to a <code>join_core</code> operator. The <code>arrange</code> operators are in charge of <em>building and maintaining</em> the indexed representations of their inputs. The <code>join_core</code> operator takes two pre-indexed, maintained collections and applies the join <em>logic</em> to the changes that move through them.</p>
<p>Why break apart the <code>join</code> operator into <code>arrange</code> and <code>join_core</code>?</p>
<p>As you may know from relational databases, a small number of indexes can service a large volume of queries. The same is true in Materialize: we can re-use the indexed representations of collections across many independent joins. By separating the operator into 1. data organization and 2. computation, we can more easily slot in shared, re-used arrangements of data. This can result in a substantial reduction in the amount of memory required, as compared to traditional dataflow systems.</p>
<p>Let’s take the example above, using <code>customer</code> and <code>location</code>. The standard dataflow system will build <em>private</em> indexes of <code>customer</code> and <code>location</code>, each indexed by their <code>zip</code> field. The <code>zip</code> field in <code>location</code> may be a primary key, meaning each record has a different value of the field. Joins using primary keys are effectively “look-ups” and are quite common. Each such look-up would be a join using <code>location.zip</code> and would require the same index. We can build the index once, and re-use it across all of the query dataflows that need it.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankmcsherry/blog/master/assets/joins/figure2.png" data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankmcsherry/blog/master/assets/joins/figure2.png" alt="" width="700"></p>
<p>We would still need a private copy of <code>customer</code> indexed by <code>zip</code>, but as we will see next there are standard clever idioms from databases that can make this efficient as well.</p>
<h2>Joins in Materialize: TPC-H examples</h2>
<p>Let’s work through a query from the TPC-H data warehousing benchmark.<br>
Query 03 is designed to match the following description:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The Shipping Priority Query retrieves the shipping priority and potential revenue, defined as the sum of l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount), of the orders having the largest revenue among those that had not been shipped as of a given date. Orders are listed in decreasing order of revenue. If more than 10 unshipped orders exist, only the 10 orders with the largest revenue are listed.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The query itself is:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT
    l_orderkey,
    o_orderdate,
    o_shippriority,
    sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue
FROM
    customer,
    orders,
    lineitem
WHERE
    c_mktsegment = 'BUILDING'
    AND c_custkey = o_custkey
    AND l_orderkey = o_orderkey
    AND o_orderdate &lt; DATE '1995-03-15'
    AND l_shipdate &gt; DATE '1995-03-15'
GROUP BY
    l_orderkey,
    o_orderdate,
    o_shippriority
ORDER BY
    revenue desc,
    o_orderdate;
</code></pre>
<p>The absence of <code>LIMIT 10</code> from the query is just how TPC-H defines things. In the interest of clarity we are going to work on the core of the query, without the <code>ORDER BY</code> or elided <code>LIMIT</code>. The query is a three-way join between <code>customer</code>, <code>orders</code>, and <code>lineitem</code>, followed by a reduction. The reduction keys seem to be three random fields, but notice that <code>l_orderkey = o_orderkey</code>, where <code>o_orderkey</code> is a primary key for <code>orders</code>; we are producing an aggregate for each order.</p>
<p>We’ll be using the scale-factor 1 dataset, as it what I have locally and it is good enough to call out some of the trade-offs. You can mentally multiply the numbers we’ll see by various powers of ten, and the same conclusions will hold.</p>
<h3>Joins in Materialize: A first implementation</h3>
<p>We can turn on <code>materialize</code> and frame the query above, using the <code>CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW ..</code> syntax. This instructs <code>materialize</code> to spin up a dataflow to read and maintain the results of the query. We can do this with no other preparation (other than creating the <code>customer</code>, <code>orders</code>, and <code>lineitem</code> data sources).</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW query_03 AS
materialize-&gt; SELECT
materialize-&gt;     l_orderkey,
materialize-&gt;     o_orderdate,
materialize-&gt;     o_shippriority,
materialize-&gt;     sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue
materialize-&gt; FROM
materialize-&gt;     customer,
materialize-&gt;     orders,
materialize-&gt;     lineitem
materialize-&gt; WHERE
materialize-&gt;     c_mktsegment = 'BUILDING'
materialize-&gt;     AND c_custkey = o_custkey
materialize-&gt;     AND l_orderkey = o_orderkey
materialize-&gt;     AND o_orderdate &lt; DATE '1995-03-15'
materialize-&gt;     AND l_shipdate &gt; DATE '1995-03-15'
materialize-&gt; GROUP BY
materialize-&gt;     l_orderkey,
materialize-&gt;     o_orderdate,
materialize-&gt;     o_shippriority;
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, we should have efficient random access to the results. There are many results, so let’s just count them instead.</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; select count(*) from query_03;
 count
-------
 11620
(1 row)

Time: 12.927 ms
materialize=&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>At the same time, maintaining this query comes with a cost. The dataflow that maintains <code>query_03</code> maintains several indexes over input and intermediate data. Here is a sketch of what the dataflow graph looks like for the query deployed against the raw data.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankmcsherry/blog/master/assets/joins/tpch0.png" data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankmcsherry/blog/master/assets/joins/tpch0.png" alt="" width="700"></p>
<p>We can read out these volumes from <code>materialize</code>‘s logging views. To read out the total records maintained by each dataflow, we would type</p>
<pre><code>-- dataflow and number of records it is sitting on.
SELECT id, name, sum(records)
FROM mz_records_per_dataflow
GROUP BY id, name
ORDER BY sum(records) desc;
</code></pre>
<p>When we do, we see (truncated):</p>

<p>This tells us that our dataflow maintains some 4,173,794 records for the <code>query_03</code> dataflow. These are in support of maintaining the 11,620 results from that query, which may seem disproportionate. The explanation is that this dataflow needs to maintain each of its inputs, which are not otherwise stored within <code>materialize</code>. For example, the <code>lineitem</code> relation has six million records, and we need to maintain all relevant records (not all of them, as the filter on date removes roughly half of them).</p>
<p>However, there is a substantial cost to maintaining this query. …</p></div></div>

<p>by Gianni Tedesco</p>

<p>Some pythonistas wonder what is the fastest way to write a function to
partition a sequence of items in to two lists based on some predicate. One
could, to be sure, <code>filter</code> the list and then <code>filterfalse</code> the list. But in
this case the predicate will evaluated twice for each item - an inefficiency
that some would balk at. That approach also doesn’t seem very parsimonious.</p>

<p>This problem has inspired several broad classes of solutions based on different
needs and priorities and some very minor controversy about which is the most
efficient. I hope to clear up the question of efficiency by introducing a new
variant here today.</p>


<p>Have you ever found yourself doing something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>foos</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>x</span> <span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>input</span> <span>if</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>type</span> <span>in</span> <span>known_foos</span><span>]</span>
<span>bars</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>x</span> <span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>input</span> <span>if</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>type</span> <span>not</span> <span>in</span> <span>known_foos</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s a DRY itch. Quite irritating. It calls for a salve. Surely Python would
have a solution for this? It has an expansive standard library…</p>


<p>The suggestion in the <code>itertools</code> documentation is to use <code>tee</code> in an elegant
way, along with <code>filter</code> and <code>filterfalse</code>, which are also both in the standard
libraries. This approach also has the benefit of working with arbitrary
generators. It can even, in principle, handle an infinitely long input
sequence.</p>

<p>It’s quite clever, so it’s worth mentioning.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>itertools</span> <span>import</span> <span>tee</span><span>,</span> <span>filterfalse</span>

<span>def</span> <span>stdlib</span><span>(</span><span>pred</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>):</span>
    <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>tee</span><span>(</span><span>it</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>filterfalse</span><span>(</span><span>pred</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>),</span> <span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>pred</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But the problem is that it’s also quite slow when you’re just going to be
materialising the results immediately. To see why, imagine calling it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>hay</span><span>,</span> <span>needles</span> <span>=</span> <span>partition</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>item</span><span>:</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>needle_set</span><span>,</span> <span>haystack</span><span>)</span>
<span>return</span> <span>Results</span><span>(</span><span>list</span><span>(</span><span>hay</span><span>),</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>needles</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As soon as we materialise one of the returned generators, tee will internally
materialise haystack in to a temporary list. And the predicates are still being evaluated twice, once for each fork of the <code>tee</code>.</p>

<p>But I can see this sort of thing being useful in a graph of <code>asyncio</code> tasks or
something. Maybe one day I will find myself in a situation where I would need
to use a cool technique like this.</p>


<p>But let’s forget about possibly-infinite generators and lazy evaluation and
just consider the case of a list that we want to partition in to two new lists.</p>

<p>For that case case, I’ve seen a couple of clever approaches.</p>

<p>The first one is quite quick to type and nice and readable. It involves using
the result of the predicate function to index in to the results tuple. It takes
advantage of the fact that <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> cast to <code>1</code> and <code>0</code> when used to
index a tuple.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>trevor</span><span>(</span><span>pred</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>):</span>
    <span>ret</span> <span>=</span> <span>([],</span> <span>[])</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>it</span><span>:</span>
        <span>ret</span><span>[</span><span>pred</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)].</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>ret</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Honestly, this probably would have been my go-to approach, but it actually
turns out to be quite slow.</p>

<p>The second is a very functional-style solution, straight out of some sort of
Haskellers PhD thesis, proposed by stackoverflow member Mariy. This one uses
<code>functools.reduce</code>, which is pythons version of <code>foldl</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>mariy</span><span>(</span><span>pred</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>reduce</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>pred</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>)].</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>or</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>,</span> <span>([],</span> <span>[]))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In princple, this is the same as the above but it takes advantage of the fact
that reduce performs some of the boilerplate for you.</p>

<p>I expect it to be a bit less efficient since it creates as many result tuples
as there are elements in the input list. Repetetive object creation and
destruction is a common source of overhead in python.</p>


<p>According to gboffi, it turns out the fastest solution that
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4578590/python-equivalent-of-filter-getting-two-output-lists-i-e-partition-of-a-list/52822805#52822805">stackoverflow</a>
came up with is just the straight forward version, credited to Mark Byers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>byers</span><span>(</span><span>pred</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>):</span>
    <span>ts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
    <span>fs</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>it</span><span>:</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>pred</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>):</span>
            <span>ts</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span>
        <span>else</span><span>:</span>
            <span>fs</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>fs</span><span>,</span> <span>ts</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But, knowing something about optimizing python code, I can see a clear
opportunity to speed this up.</p>


<p>We can disassemble this to python bytecode with <code>dis</code>. Generally speaking, the
main determinant of performance in these kind of loops is the number of
bytecode instructions which need to be dispatched per iteration.</p>

<p>So here is what the Byers version compiles to in cpython 3.9:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  2           0 BUILD_LIST               0
              2 STORE_FAST               2 (ts)

  3           4 BUILD_LIST               0
              6 STORE_FAST               3 (fs)

  4           8 LOAD_FAST                1 (it)
             10 GET_ITER
        &gt;&gt;   12 FOR_ITER                34 (to 48)
             14 STORE_FAST               4 (item)

  5          16 LOAD_FAST                0 (pred)
             18 LOAD_FAST                4 (item)
             20 CALL_FUNCTION            1
             22 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE       36

  6          24 LOAD_FAST                2 (ts)
             26 LOAD_METHOD              0 (append)
             28 LOAD_FAST                4 (item)
             30 CALL_METHOD              1
             32 POP_TOP
             34 JUMP_ABSOLUTE           12

  8     &gt;&gt;   36 LOAD_FAST                1 (fs)
             38 LOAD_METHOD              0 (append)
             40 LOAD_FAST                4 (item)
             42 CALL_METHOD              1
             44 POP_TOP
             46 JUMP_ABSOLUTE           12

  9     &gt;&gt;   48 LOAD_FAST                3 (fs)
             50 LOAD_FAST                2 (ts)
             52 BUILD_TUPLE              2
             54 RETURN_VALUE
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The inner loop is between locations 12 and 46. It’s 18 instructions long.</p>

<p>We can see that the append code has some duplicated instructions in each branch
(24-34, and 36-46), but since only one branch is taken at a time, that
shouldn’t really be counted.</p>

<p>So if we measure the actual instruction path-length per iteration, it comes out
to 12 instructions.</p>

<p>More importantly, we can see that inside that inner loop we’re doing a lookup
of the <code>append</code> method, which is actually looking up a string in a dictionary.
For this reason, the <code>LOAD_GLOBAL</code> and <code>LOAD_METHOD</code> calls are among the
slowest of the basic instruction types in the python machine (not including the
instructions which call out to python subroutines, of course).</p>


<p>We have probably all heard that python is a dynamic language. But we may not
know what all of the consequences of that fact are. For one thing, it means
that attribute lookups are often expensive dictionary lookups. But it also
means that even some very obvious optimisations <em>simply cannot be made</em>. For
example, the python compiler cannot, in general, optimise:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Program A
</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
<span>for</span> <span>a</span> <span>in</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span>
    <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>in to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Program B
</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
<span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>append</span>
<span>for</span> <span>a</span> <span>in</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span>
    <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The reason for this is that the method <code>list.append</code> is absolutely free to
assign a different value to <code>self.append</code>. This means that programs A and B are
(or at least, may be) semantically different. Therefore B is not a valid
optimization of A.</p>

<p>Now you might think that, well, the bytecode compiler can know about the
implementation of <code>list.append</code> because it’s built-in. Which is true. But it
doesn’t stop any other code, for example in <code>b.__iter__.next()</code> from obtaining
a reference to <code>x</code> via any number of mechanisms and then altering its attribute
dict.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t even have to resort to reflection - the local variable <code>x</code> could
just be a reference to an object which is also reachable in a global scope. And
what variables there are in the global scope can be modified on the fly by any
code so it wouldn’t be enough to do an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_analysis">escape-analysis</a> at compile
time.</p>

<p>Frankly there are just too many avenues in python for this sort of
jiggery-pokery to take place. And these avenues are kind of the point of
python.</p>


<p>OK, that’s interesting, but what if we just explicitly apply the above
optimisation?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>scara</span><span>(</span><span>pred</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>):</span>
    <span>ts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
    <span>fs</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
    <span>t</span> <span>=</span> <span>ts</span><span>.</span><span>append</span>
    <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>fs</span><span>.</span><span>append</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>it</span><span>:</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>pred</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>):</span>
            <span>t</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span>
        <span>else</span><span>:</span>
            <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>fs</span><span>,</span> <span>ts</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can see from the bytecode that this has reduced the instruction path-length
as we expected:</p>
<div><div><pre><code> 28           0 BUILD_LIST               0

<p>The inner loop takes place between locations 24 and 48. It’s 16 instructions
long. And if we look at the instruction path length for the loop, it’s now 11
instructions long. One shorter than before. Of course, it’s that missing
<code>LOAD_ATTR</code> instruction which has been hoisted out of the loop in to the
function preamble.</p>


<p>I couldn’t figure out a way to get the inner loop any tighter but I did find a
way to make the code more compact by removing duplicated code on both sides of
the branch. It led to a tiny improvement in performance. Here it is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>scara2</span><span>(</span><span>pred</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>):</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p><em>Adi Shamir’s Secret Sharing</em> is a cryptographic algorithm that allows distinct parties to jointly share ownership of a single secret by holding <em>shares</em>. The original secret can only be reconstructed by using a minimum number of shares, which allows different parties to cooperate without the need to fully trust one another.</p>
<h2>Example Problem</h2>
<p>To illustrate, let’s imagine that a family of four all share a single Bitcoin wallet. This Bitcoin wallet contains a single private key that all members of the family co-own. Because there is a single key, any of the family members can use that key to spend all of the Bitcoins. </p>
<p>The family has a problem: If they each keep a copy, then only one of their copies needs to be compromised to have all the coins stolen. If only one of them keeps the key, then that person may lose it or decide to double-cross the other family members.</p>
<p>Luckily, one of the family members is also a cryptographer. Instead of naively sharing the original key, they use SSS (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shamir’s secret sharing</a>). The family creates four shares and sets a threshold of three, with the Bitcoin key as the original secret. Now, their plan has the following properties:</p>
<ul><li>They have not stored the bitcoin key in a single place which makes it harder to steal</li><li>Members of the family need to cooperate to spend the Bitcoin, one family member can’t betray the others</li><li>If a family member dies or loses their share, the other three members can still reconstruct the key</li></ul>
<h2>Understanding the Threshold</h2>
<p>Every Shamir sharing scheme has a total number of shares and a threshold. The <strong>threshold is the number of shares required</strong> to reconstruct the original secret. For example, with five shares and a threshold of three, you only need three of the five shares to calculate the original secret.</p>
<h2>The Math – Lines</h2>
<p>One of the fundamental mathematical properties used in Shamir’s secret sharing is the fact that it takes <em>k</em> points to define a polynomial of degree <em>k </em>– 1. For example:</p>
<ul><li>Only one line can be drawn between two points</li><li>Only one possible parabola crosses through the same three points</li><li>Only one cubic curve passes through the same four points</li><li>An infinite number of lines can be drawn through the same point</li><li>An infinite number of parabolas can be drawn through the same two points</li></ul>
<h2>The Math – Walkthrough</h2>
<p>Let us construct a scheme to share our secret 1954 (<em>S)</em> with 4 (<em>n)</em> shares and a threshold of 3 (<em>k)</em>.</p>
<p>First, we randomly choose <em>k</em> – 1 positive integers, so in our case, 2 positive integers. We randomly choose 43 and 12.</p>
<p>Then, we build a polynomial of the form</p>
<pre><code lang="bash">y = a0 + a1*x + a2*x^2</code></pre>
<p>Where a0 is the secret, and a1 and a2 are our randomly chosen integers. We are left with:</p>
<pre><code lang="bash">y = 1954 + 43x + 12x^2</code></pre>
<p>Then, we use this formula to create 4 points (shares) that we give to each participant.</p>
<h3><span>Share 1</span></h3>
<p>(x, y) where x = 1</p>
<p>y = 1954 + 43*1 + 12*1^2 = 2009</p>
<p>(1, 2009)</p>
<h3><span>Share 2</span></h3>
<p>(x, y) where x = 2</p>
<p>y = 1954 + 43*2 + 12*2^2 = 2088</p>
<p>(2, 2088)</p>
<h3><span>Share 3</span> </h3>
<p>(x, y) where x = 3</p>
<p>y = 1954 + 43*3 + 12*3^2 = 2191</p>
<p>(3, 2191)</p>
<h3><span>Share 4</span></h3>
<p>(x, y) where x = 4</p>
<p>y = 1954 + 43*4 + 12*4^2 = 2318</p>
<p>(4, 2318)</p>
<h2>Reconstruction</h2>
<p>Each participant in our scheme now owns one <code>(x,y)</code> point, which is a single share. Remember that we set our threshold to 3 and that 3 points define a parabola (polynomial of degree 2) perfectly. That means that if we use three points, we can draw a parabola and calculate a0 (the secret). Let’s assume we have control of shares 1, 2, and 4.</p>
<h3>Step 1 – Plot the points (shares) that we control</h3>

<h3>Step 2 – Draw the corresponding parabola </h3>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="540" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-1024x540.jpg" alt="shamirs secret sharing" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-1024x540.jpg 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-300x158.jpg 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-768x405.jpg 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-1536x810.jpg 1536w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-150x79.jpg 150w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="shamirs secret sharing"></figure></div>
<h3>Step 3 – Find the point where <code>x=0</code>. It’s <code>y</code> value is the secret</h3>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="555" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-shares-1024x555.jpg" alt="shamirs secret sharing shares" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-shares-1024x555.jpg 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-shares-300x162.jpg 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-shares-768x416.jpg 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-shares-1536x832.jpg 1536w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-shares-150x81.jpg 150w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-shares.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="shamirs secret sharing shares"></figure></div>
<p>In our case, the secret is <code>1954</code>.</p>
<h2>It’s not actually that simple. We need finite fields.</h2>
<p>While the example we worked through above is great for demonstration purposes, it actually isn’t very secure. For each share that an attacker obtains, they actually are gaining more and more information about the secret. While two points don’t perfectly describe a parabola, they still leak critical information <em>about</em> the parabola.</p>
<p>The solution lies in <a aria-label="finite field arithmetic (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field_arithmetic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">finite field arithmetic</a>. By plotting the function on a finite field of sufficient size, the graph of the polynomial becomes disjointed and scattered, which means the attacker is unable to make educated guesses about the pathing of the underlying function.</p>
<h2>Adi Shamir</h2>
<p>Adi Shamir is an Israeli cryptographer famous for Shamir’s Secret Sharing, but he is also a co-inventor of the widely used RSA algorithm that the vast majority of the internet is built upon. Shamir was born in&nbsp;Tel Aviv and earned an undergraduate degree<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science" rel="noopener"> </a>in&nbsp;math&nbsp;from the university there. Later he obtained his master’s and Ph.D. degrees in&nbsp;Computer Science&nbsp;from the&nbsp;Weizmann Institute&nbsp;in 1975 and 1977 respectively.</p>

<p>Bash scripts. Almost anyone needs to write one sooner or later. Almost no one says “yeah, I love writing them”. And that’s why almost everyone is putting low attention while writing them.</p>



<p>I won’t try to make you a Bash expert (since I’m not a one either), but I will show you a minimal template that will make your scripts safer. You don’t need to thank me, your future self will thank you.</p>



<h2><span id="why_scripting_in_bash"></span>Why scripting in Bash?<span></span></h2>



<p>The best summary of Bash scripting appeared recently on my Twitter feed:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The opposite of "it's like riding a bike" is "it's like programming in bash".</p><p>A phrase which means that no matter how many times you do something, you will have to re-learn it every single time.</p></div>— Jake Wharton (@JakeWharton) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeWharton/status/1334177665356587008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>But Bash has something in common with another widely beloved language. Just like JavaScript, it won’t go away easily. While we can hope that Bash won’t become the main language for literally everything, it’s always somewhere near.</p>



<p>Bash <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-Bash-considered-the-lingua-franca-of-shells/answer/Paul-Reiber">inherited the shell throne</a> and can be found on almost every Linux, including Docker images. And this is the environment in which most of the backend runs. So if you need to script the server application startup, a CI/CD step, or integration test run, Bash is there for you.</p>



<p>To glue few commands together, pass output from one to another, and just start some executable, Bash is the easiest and most native solution. While it makes perfect sense to write bigger, more complicated scripts in other languages, you can’t expect to have Python, Ruby, fish, or whatever another interpreter you believe is the best, available everywhere. And you probably should think twice and then once more before adding it to some prod server, Docker image, or CI environment.</p>



<p>Yet Bash is far from perfect. The syntax is a nightmare. Error handling is difficult. There are landmines everywhere. And we have to deal with it.</p>



<h2><span id="bash_script_template"></span>Bash script template<span></span></h2>



<p>Without further ado, here it is.</p>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -Eeuo pipefail
trap cleanup SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT

script_dir=$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" &amp;&gt;/dev/null &amp;&amp; pwd -P)

usage() {
  cat &lt;&lt;EOF
Usage: $(basename "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}") [-h] [-v] [-f] -p param_value arg1 [arg2...]

Script description here.

Available options:

-h, --help      Print this help and exit
-v, --verbose   Print script debug info
-f, --flag      Some flag description
-p, --param     Some param description
EOF
  exit
}

cleanup() {
  trap - SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT
  # script cleanup here
}

setup_colors() {
  if [[ -t 2 ]] &amp;&amp; [[ -z "${NO_COLOR-}" ]] &amp;&amp; [[ "${TERM-}" != "dumb" ]]; then
    NOFORMAT='\033[0m' RED='\033[0;31m' GREEN='\033[0;32m' ORANGE='\033[0;33m' BLUE='\033[0;34m' PURPLE='\033[0;35m' CYAN='\033[0;36m' YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
  else
    NOFORMAT='' RED='' GREEN='' ORANGE='' BLUE='' PURPLE='' CYAN='' YELLOW=''
  fi
}

msg() {
  echo &gt;&amp;2 -e "${1-}"
}

die() {
  local msg=$1
  local code=${2-1} # default exit status 1
  msg "$msg"
  exit "$code"
}

parse_params() {
  # default values of variables set from params
  flag=0
  param=''

  while :; do
    case "${1-}" in
    -h | --help) usage ;;
    -v | --verbose) set -x ;;
    --no-color) NO_COLOR=1 ;;
    -f | --flag) flag=1 ;; # example flag
    -p | --param) # example named parameter
      param="${2-}"
      shift
      ;;
    -?*) die "Unknown option: $1" ;;
    *) break ;;
    esac
    shift
  done

  args=("$@")

  # check required params and arguments
  [[ -z "${param-}" ]] &amp;&amp; die "Missing required parameter: param"
  [[ ${#args[@]} -eq 0 ]] &amp;&amp; die "Missing script arguments"

  return 0
}

parse_params "$@"
setup_colors

# script logic here

msg "${RED}Read parameters:${NOFORMAT}"
msg "- flag: ${flag}"
msg "- param: ${param}"
msg "- arguments: ${args[*]-}"</code></pre>



<p>The idea was to not make it too long. I don’t want to scroll 500 lines to the script logic. At the same time, I want some strong foundations for any script. But Bash is not making this easy, lacking any form of dependencies management.</p>



<p>One solution would be to have a separate script with all the boilerplate and utility functions and execute it at the beginning. The downside would be to have to always attach this second file everywhere, losing the “simple Bash script” idea along the way. So I decided to put in the template only what I consider to be a minimum to keep it possible short.</p>



<p>Now let’s look at it in more detail.</p>



<h3><span id="choose_bash"></span>Choose Bash<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash</code></pre>



<p>Script traditionally starts with a shebang. For the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21612980/why-is-usr-bin-env-bash-superior-to-bin-bash">best compatibility</a>, it references <code>/usr/bin/env</code>, not the <code>/bin/bash</code> directly. Although, if you read comments in the linked StackOverflow question, even this can fail sometimes.</p>



<h3><span id="fail_fast"></span>Fail fast<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>set -Eeuo pipefail</code></pre>



<p>The <code>set</code> command changes script execution options. For example, <strong>normally Bash does not care if some command failed</strong>, returning a non-zero exit status code. It just happily jumps to the next one. Now consider this little script:</p>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash
cp important_file ./backups/
rm important_file</code></pre>



<p>What will happen, if the <code>backups</code> directory does not exist? Exactly, you will get an error message in the console, but before you will be able to react, the file will be already removed by the second command.</p>



<p>For details on what options exactly <code>set -Eeuo pipefail</code> changes and how they will protect you, I refer you to the <a href="https://vaneyckt.io/posts/safer_bash_scripts_with_set_euxo_pipefail/">article I have in my bookmarks for a few years now</a>.</p>



<p>Although you should know that there are some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/g1vsxk/the_first_two_statements_of_your_bash_script/fniifmk?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">arguments against setting those options</a>.</p>



<h3><span id="get_the_location"></span>Get the location<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>script_dir=$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" &amp;&gt;/dev/null &amp;&amp; pwd -P)</code></pre>



<p>This line <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/246128/2512304">does its best</a> to define the script’s location directory<s>, and then we <code>cd</code> to it. Why?</s></p>



<p>Often our scripts are operating on paths relative to the script location, copying files and executing commands, assuming the script directory is also a working directory. And it is, as long as we execute the script from its directory.</p>



<p>But if, let’s say, our CI config executes script like this:</p>



<pre><code>/opt/ci/project/script.sh</code></pre>



<p>then our script is operating not in project dir, but some completely different workdir of our CI tool. We can fix it, by going to the directory before executing the script:</p>



<pre><code>cd /opt/ci/project &amp;&amp; ./script.sh</code></pre>



<p>But it’s much nicer to solve this on the script side. So, if the script reads some file or executes another program from the same directory, call it like this:</p>



<pre><code>cat "$script_dir/my_file"</code></pre>



<p>At the same time, the script does not change the workdir location. If the script is executed from some other directory and the user provides a relative path to some file, we will still be able to read it.</p>



<h3><span id="try_to_clean_up"></span>Try to clean up<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>trap cleanup SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT

cleanup() {
  trap - SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT
  # script cleanup here
}</code></pre>



<p>Think about the <code>trap</code> like of a <code>finally</code> block for the script. At the end of the script – normal, caused by an error or an external signal – the <code>cleanup()</code> function will be executed. This is a place where you can, for example, try to remove all temporary files created by the script.</p>



<p>Just remember that the <code>cleanup()</code> can be called not only at the end but as well having the script done any part of the work. Not necessarily all the resources you try to cleanup will exist.</p>



<h3><span id="display_helpful_help"></span>Display helpful help<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>usage() {
  cat &lt;&lt;EOF
Usage: $(basename "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}") [-h] [-v] [-f] -p param_value arg1 [arg2...]

Script description here.

...
EOF
  exit
}</code></pre>



<p>Having the <code>usage()</code> relatively close to the top of the script, it will act in two ways:</p>



<ul><li>to <strong>display help</strong> for someone who does not know all the options and does not want to go over the whole script to discover them,</li><li>as a <strong>minimal documentation</strong> when someone modifies the script (for example you, 2 weeks later, not even remembering writing it in the first place).</li></ul>



<p>I don’t argue to document every function here. But a short, nice script usage message is a required minimum.</p>



<h3><span id="print_nice_messages"></span>Print nice messages<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>setup_colors() {
  if [[ -t 2 ]] &amp;&amp; [[ -z "${NO_COLOR-}" ]] &amp;&amp; [[ "${TERM-}" != "dumb" ]]; then
    NOFORMAT='\033[0m' RED='\033[0;31m' GREEN='\033[0;32m' ORANGE='\033[0;33m' BLUE='\033[0;34m' PURPLE='\033[0;35m' CYAN='\033[0;36m' YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
  else
    NOFORMAT='' RED='' GREEN='' ORANGE='' BLUE='' PURPLE='' CYAN='' YELLOW=''
  fi
}

msg() {
  echo &gt;&amp;2 -e "${1-}"
}</code></pre>



<p>Firstly, remove the <code>setup_colors()</code> function if you don’t want to use colors in text anyway. I keep it because I know I would use colors more often if I wouldn’t have to google codes for them every time.</p>



<p>Secondly, those <strong>colors are meant to be used with the <code>msg()</code> function only</strong>, not with the <code>echo</code> command.</p>



<p>The <strong><code>msg()</code> function is meant to be used to print everything that is not a script output</strong>. This includes all logs and messages, not only the errors. Citing the great <a href="https://medium.com/@jdxcode/12-factor-cli-apps-dd3c227a0e46">12 Factor CLI Apps</a> article:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>In short: stdout is for output, stderr is for messaging.</strong></p><cite><a href="https://jdxcode.com/">Jeff Dickey</a>, who <a href="https://github.com/oclif/oclif/graphs/contributors">knows a little</a> about <a href="https://github.com/heroku/cli/graphs/contributors">building CLI apps</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>That’s why in most cases you shouldn’t use colors for <code>stdout</code> anyway.</p>



<p>Messages printed with <code>msg()</code> are sent to <code>stderr</code> stream and support special sequences, like colors. And colors are disabled anyway if the <code>stderr</code> output is not an interactive terminal or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://no-color.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the standard parameters</a>&nbsp;is passed.</p>



<p>Usage:</p>



<pre><code>msg "This is a ${RED}very important${NOFORMAT} message, but not a script output value!"</code></pre>



<p>To check how it behaves when the <code>stderr</code> is not an interactive terminal, add a line like above to the script. Then execute it redirecting <code>stderr</code> to <code>stdout</code> and piping it to <code>cat</code>. Pipe operation makes the output no longer being sent directly to the terminal, but to the next command, so the colors should be disabled now.</p>



<pre><code>$ ./test.sh 2&gt;&amp;1 | cat
This is a very important message, but not a script output value!</code></pre>



<h3><span id="parse_any_parameters"></span>Parse any parameters<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>parse_params() {
  # default values of variables set from params
  flag=0
  param=''

  while :; do
    case "${1-}" in
    -h | --help) usage ;;
    -v | --verbose) set -x ;;
    --no-color) NO_COLOR=1 ;;
    -f | --flag) flag=1 ;; # example flag
    -p | --param) # …</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><h2>What’s wrong with current voice UIs</h2><p>There is a lot of positive momentum around <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/what-is-voice-user-interface/">voice interfaces</a>. We’ve all seen the stats: the number of smart speakers in US households has risen steadily for the past five years. The share of <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/voice-search/">voice searches</a> of all search engine traffic has soared. Yet, the type of revolution that the touch screen gave birth to, after the launch of the iPhone, hasn’t really happened for voice — despite all the hype. Why is that?</p><p>Anyone who has a bit of experience from using voice interfaces knows that you can do simple things like setting on the alarm, switching on the lights, or playing your favorite music on Spotify pretty easily. However, if you try to do anything more sophisticated, say, <a href="https://www.speechly.com/use-cases/fast-food-ordering/">order pizza</a> for your eight best friends, reserve an intercontinental flight for a family of five, or buy a new party dress online, the chances are that you're going to fail miserably. For more demanding and for most real-world tasks, the user experience with voice just isn’t there yet — at least as it is for the touch screen.</p><p>Still, contrary to what people might think, the problem is not really anymore in speech recognition or natural language understanding accuracy. Even for fairly open-ended domains, both speech recognition and natural language understanding accuracy is pretty close to human parity.</p><p>The problem lies rather in the way these systems give feedback to the user. Typically, when a voice command is uttered, the modern <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/why-smart-speakers-are-not-the-future-of-voice/">voice assistants</a> wait until the user has stopped talking (using the technique called endpointing) before they start processing it. This works great for short things like “turn on the lights” or “Play X on Spotify”. However, for more complex tasks this is a disaster.</p><p>Imagine if you need to express something that requires a longer explanation. When looking for a new t-shirt, a person might be tempted to say something like “I’m interested in t-shirts for men ...in color red, blue or orange, let’s say Boss ...no wait, I mean Hilfiger ...maybe size medium or large ...and something that’s on sale and can be shipped by tomorrow ...and I’d like to see the cheapest options first.”</p><p>When uttering something this long and winding to a traditional voice UI, most likely something will go wrong, resulting in the familiar, “Sorry, I didn’t quite get that.” Having just made the extended effort of explaining your intent to the system, this is an extremely frustrating experience. Or even worse, the endpointing might trigger a false positive half way the utterance, causing the voice assistant to prematurely resolve the intent and start a voice synthesis response, interrupting the speaker violently and irritatingly.</p><p>In the following sections of this article, we will introduce the powerful techniques of streaming spoken language understanding and reactive <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/voice-application-design-guide/">multi-modal voice user interfaces</a> that address the very problem the current generation of voice UIs suffer from.</p><h2>Streaming Spoken Language Understanding</h2><p>Contrary to the traditional voice systems that rely on endpointing to trigger a response, the systems using streaming spoken language understanding actively try to comprehend the user intent from the very moment the user starts to talk. The idea is that as soon as the user says something actionable, the UI is able to instantly react to it.</p><p>The benefit here is that if the system does not understand the user, the UI will instantly signal this back. This way the UI will fail fast but also recover quickly as the user can immediately stop, correct, and continue. On the other hand, if the system does understand the user, also this information is conveyed immediately. This gives reassurance to the user that their message is going through, and that they can continue their expression. As long as the system understands, the user can just go on and on, which results in longer and more complex utterances that are supported.</p><p>Moreover, the immediate feedback from both the small failures and successes of the UI can be combined in a way that the users can correct either themselves or the UI in an online manner, e.g., “I’m interested in Boss, no, I mean Tommy Hilfiger”. This ushers a way for the UI to not only support more sophisticated and complex UI workflows but also a more stream-of-consciousness way of expressing the users’ intent. This is more natural for humans and requires much less effort than the very specific way that the current voice UIs require the utterances to be given.</p><h2>Reactive and non interruptive multi-modal voice user interfaces</h2><p>The most prominent feedback modality of the current day voice interfaces is voice synthesis. As a feedback mechanism, however, this works poorly as any ongoing user utterance will be abruptly interrupted — a problem exhibited commonly in the contemporary voice UIs. As a feedback mechanism, voice is also a pretty narrow band. Instead, the feedback should be given with a non-interruptive modality. Such modalities include haptic, non-linguistic auditory, and perhaps most naturally and expressively, visual feedback. Using these modalities, the UI can react fast and without interruption to the user. For instance, in the case of “I’m interested in t-shirts,” the UI would swiftly show the most popular t-shirt products, instantly enabling the user to continue with a refining utterance, ”do you have Boss.” This narrows further down the displayed products to show only the Boss branded t-shirts.</p><p>This iteration loop reminisces a familiar setting to everybody: human face-to-face communication, which is, in effect, a reactive, multimodal communication setup. In fact, it is a common misperception that human face-to-face conversation is primarily turn-based (or half-duplex) in a similar fashion that chatbots or voice assistance are. Meaning, first I say something, then you say something, then I say something again, and so on. Not exclusively. The human face-to-face conversation is very much full-duplex: as one person talks, the listener gives feedback with nods, facial expressions, gestures, and interjections like aha and mhm. Furthermore, if the person listening doesn't understand what is being said, they are likely to start making more or less subtle facial expressions to signal their lack of comprehension. This is the tight full-duplex feedback loop that makes human face-to-face communication so efficient. The same efficiency is exhibited in the reactive multi-modal voice user computer interfaces!</p><h2>Voice is not the UI, voice is a modality!</h2><p>At the height of the voice assistant hype ushered in by Amazon Alexa, many probably heard the flying phrase “Voice is the UI!”. This article disagrees. Voice is a modality! By augmenting a UI with voice in combination with other available modalities, the result can be an extremely efficient UI.</p><blockquote><p>The perfect interface is when you can use touch and voice seamlessly and choose the best option for the context, sometimes interchangeably</p></blockquote><p>This efficiency comes from how the modalities work together, not from voice alone. Voice is, for instance, a very efficient method for <a href="https://www.speechly.com/design/">inputting rich information</a>. For scrolling, swiping, pointing, or selecting between a couple of valid alternatives, touch is probably better. For displaying complex multidimensional information, the visual display is unbeatable. Combining all of these modalities in a smart way is the killer app.</p><h2>What was the revolutionary thing in the iPhone?</h2><p>Circling back to where we started, the iPhone moment. What made the iPhone so powerful? Well, the very intuitive swipe and pinch gestures with which the user could effortlessly control their phone. However, when the iPhone came out, the touch screen wasn't a new thing. There had been prior touch screen devices. They just sucked! You could swipe or press, and a second or two later something would happen.</p><p>What the iPhone brought to the mix was the extremely fast feedback that its touch screen could provide to the user, resulting in the very intuitive, fluid, and satisfying user experience of controlling your phone. Voice UIs based on streaming spoken language understanding are a similar type of revolution. The streaming spoken language understanding offers extremely fast, fluid, and intuitive feedback to the user akin to what the iPhone brought to the controlling devices back in 2007. However — this time, voice is in the center, providing user experiences that we haven’t seen before, ushering the iPhone moment at last for voice as well.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<h2>Why I Quit a $500K Job at Amazon to Work for Myself</h2>



<p>Last week I left my cushy job at Amazon after 8 years. Despite getting rewarded repeatedly with promotions, compensation, recognition, and praise, I wasn’t motivated enough to do another year.</p>



<p>I spent my entire time in AWS building tools for developers. I liked that field so much that I would have been satisfied working in it for the rest of my life.</p>



<p>I joined Amazon as an entry level developer. Within 3.5 years I had been promoted twice to a senior engineer, and I was practically guaranteed another promotion to principal engineer this year if I had stayed. My potential at the company was high, I was told.</p>



<p>My esteem within the company grew along the years and I was regarded an expert and a leader in my field. People looked up to me and respected me.</p>



<p>I made $75K in my first year and that gradually grew to $511K by my last year. I could have made another $1M if I stayed another couple of years.</p>



<p>My work–life balance was good too, despite Amazon’s reputation. I didn’t need to prove myself anymore, and I could get everything done in 40 hours a week. My team worked from home one day a week, and I rarely opened my laptop at night or weekends.</p>



<p>Also, the people I worked with were exceptional. I had three managers in total, and all were generous people with lots of empathy. I’m very grateful to everyone I worked with.</p>



<p>Everything was going well and getting better. But despite all this, my motivation to go to work each morning was decreasing—almost in an inverse trend to my career and income growth.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://i0.wp.com/danielvassallo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rewards_motivation-2340812862-1549830899929.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1" alt="Rewards up, motivation down." srcset="https://i0.wp.com/danielvassallo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rewards_motivation-2340812862-1549830899929.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/danielvassallo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rewards_motivation-2340812862-1549830899929.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/danielvassallo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rewards_motivation-2340812862-1549830899929.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/danielvassallo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rewards_motivation-2340812862-1549830899929.png?resize=1100%2C619&amp;ssl=1 1100w, https://i0.wp.com/danielvassallo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rewards_motivation-2340812862-1549830899929.png?w=1801&amp;ssl=1 1801w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Rewards up, motivation down.</figcaption></figure>



<p>It would have been foolish of me to expect my motivation to start increasing if I got yet another promotion, or another compensation bump, or another big project. But there was something else that was trending down with my motivation. It was my freedom.</p>



<h3>The Motivation Decline</h3>



<p>For the first couple of years my motivation was off the charts. I was mostly working with another person on an internal tool, and there was very little scrutiny around it. It was a time where I had a lot of independence in choosing how to work and what to work on—at least relative to more recent years.  It was just me and the other person improving this thing, talking to users, releasing updates, testing it, and everything else. Whatever we felt was important, we generally got to do. We did the best work we could for its own sake and we were mostly self-directed.</p>



<p>The last couple of years, however, were quite different. I was leading the most important project in the history of my department, with many stakeholders and complex goals. What I could do was always bounded by my ability to convince all the people involved that it was the best way to navigate our goals. </p>



<p>I was always going to be working on somebody else’s terms at Amazon. The terms were simple in the beginning (keep fixing the thing), but kept getting more complicated as the years passed by (maximize all goals; satisfy all stakeholders). Then there were other restrictions inherent to working in a large organization about how to do the work, what work to do, what goals to set, and what business was worth pursuing. This situation was squeezing me into doing things that I’d rather not do, and vice versa.</p>



<h3 id="mce_19">Finding New Motivation</h3>



<p>What kind of work would I do if I had to do it forever? Not something that I did until I reached some milestone (an exit), but something that I would consider satisfactory if I continued to do it until I’m 80. What is out there that I could do that would make me excited waking up every day for the next 45 years that could also earn me enough money to cover my expenses? Is that too unambitious? I don’t think so. Because there are two types of drivers that get me out of bed in the morning.</p>



<p>One comes from the outside in the form of a carrot or a stick. For instance, I’m not automatically driven to do my tax returns every April, but I make sure I do because I don’t want to go to prison. Or I might not want to work on something I dislike, but I do so anyway because I may need to pay the bills, or want to buy a fancy car. These are the extrinsic motivators.</p>



<p>The other comes from within. This is what drives me to do things when there isn’t a carrot or a stick. Hobbies are one activity driven by this. But what I was looking for was something that I could do for a living that was also driven by this type of motivation: the intrinsic kind.</p>



<p>Back to the question of whether this is too unambitious. See, I realized that extrinsic motivation doesn’t last. Whenever I got promoted, it felt good for a week, and then it was as over. When I first hit $100K income, I would take a peek at my W2 for a few days admiring the six digits, but then it wore off. When I hit $200K, $300K, $400K, and $500K, it was the same thing. I would be delusional to think that earning $1M, or $10M would suddenly make it different. And I feel the same with every other extrinsic reward or material possession. Getting them feels good for a while, but this wears off quickly.</p>



<p>The things that don’t wear off are those that I’ve been doing since I was a kid, when nothing was forcing me to do them. Things such as writing code, selling my creations, charting my own path, calling it like I saw it. I know my strengths, and I know what motivates me, so why not do this all the time? I’m lucky to live in a time where I can do something independently in my area of expertise without requiring large amounts of capital or outside investors. So that’s what I’m doing.</p>



<h3>What’s Next?</h3>



<p>I’m going all in on independence, and I’m going to try to make a living with my own bare hands starting from nothing. I don’t expect to only do things that I like, but it will be on my terms. My target is to cover my family’s expenses before I run out of savings while doing something that intrinsically motivates me. What more would I ever want to be satisfied with my work?</p>

    <h5>Posted on December 14, 2020</h5>
    

    <p><a href="https://sixtyfps.io/">SixtyFPS</a> is a new project aiming at making a UI toolkit.
            The <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/blog/introducing-sixtyfps.html">previous blog post</a> was introducing the project.
            This blog post explains, through a small tutorial, how to use SixtyFPS to create a small game.
        </p>

    <p>
        In this tutorial, we are going to demonstrate how to create a simple memory puzzle game with SixtyFPS.
        We are going to combine the
        <code>.60</code> language for the graphics with the game rules implemented in the Rust programming language.
        The SixtyFPS framework also supports other programming languages like <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/cpp/readme">C++</a> or <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/node/">JavaScript</a>.
        Update: we also published <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/blog/%3Ca%20href=" ..="" blog="" memory-game-tutorial-cpp.html"="">"&gt;a C++ version of this tutorial</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        The game consists of a grid of 16 rectangular tiles. When clicking on a tile, an icon underneath is uncovered.
        We know that there are 8 different icons in total, so each tile has a sibling somewhere in the grid with the
        same icon. The objective is to locate all icon pairs. Only two tiles can be uncovered at the same time. If they
        are not the same, then the icons will be obscured again. We need to remember under which tiles the matching
        graphics are hiding. If two tiles with the same icon are uncovered, then they remain visible - they are solved.
    </p>

<p> This is how the game looks like in action:</p>


<p>You can also <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/demos/memory/" target="_blank">play in your web browser</a>.
</p>

    <h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>

    <p>We assume that you are a somewhat familiar with Rust, and that you know how to create a Rust application with
        <code>cargo new</code>. The <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started">Rust Getting Started Guide"</a>
        can help you get set up.</p>


        <p>First, we create a new cargo project:</p>
<pre><code>cargo new memory
cd memory</code></pre>

        <p>Then we edit <code>Cargo.toml</code> to add the sixtyfps dependency:</p>

<pre><code>[dependencies]
sixtyfps = "0.0.4"
</code></pre>

    <p>Finally we copy the hello world program from the <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/">SixtyFPS
            documentation</a> into our <code>src/main.rs</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sixtyfps::sixtyfps!{
    MainWindow := Window {
        Text {
            text: "hello world";
            color: green;
        }
    }
}
fn main() {
    MainWindow::new().run();
}
</code></pre>



    <h3 id="memory-tile">Memory Tile</h3>


    <p>
        With the skeleton in place, let's look at the first element of the game, the memory tile. It will be the
        visual building block that consists of an underlying filled rectangle background, the icon image. Later we'll add a
        covering rectangle that acts as a curtain. The background rectangle is declared to be 64 logical pixels wide and tall,
        and it is filled with a soothing tone of blue. Note how lengths in the <code>.60</code> language have a unit, here
        the <code>px</code> suffix. That makes the code easier to read and the compiler can detect when your're accidentally
        mixing values with different units attached to them.
    </p>

    <p>We copy the following code inside of the <code>sixtyfps!</code> macro:</p>

    <pre><code>MemoryTile := Rectangle {
    width: 64px;
    height: 64px;
    color: #3960D5;

    Image {
        source: img!"icons/bus.png";
        width: parent.width;
        height: parent.height;
    }
}

MainWindow := Window {
    MemoryTile {}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Inside the <code>Rectangle</code> we place an <code>Image</code>
    element that loads an icon with the <code>img!</code> directive. The path is
    relative to the folder in which the <code>Cargo.toml</code> is located. This icon and others we're going to
    use later need to be installed first. You can download a <a href="https://sixtyfps.io//blog/memory-game-tutorial/icons.zip">Zip
        archive</a> that we have prepared and
    extract it with the following two commands:</p>

<pre><code>curl -O https://sixtyfps.io/blog/memory-game-tutorial/icons.zip
unzip icons.zip</code></pre>

<p>
    This should unpack an <code>icons</code> directory containing a bunch of icons.
</p>



    <h3 id="memory-tiles">Polishing the Tile</h3>

    <p>
        Next, let's add a curtain like cover that opens up when clicking. We achieve this by declaring two rectangles
        below the <code>Image</code>, so that they are drawn afterwards and thus on top of the image.
        The <code>TouchArea</code> element declares a transparent rectangular region that allows
        reacting to user input such as a mouse click or tap. We use that to forward a signal to the <em>MainWindow</em>
        that the tile was clicked on. In the <em>MainWindow</em> we react by flipping a custom <em>open_curtain</em> property.
        That in turn is used in property bindings for the animated width and x properties. Let's look at the two states a bit
        more in detail:
    </p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th scope="col"><em>open_curtain</em> value:</th>
                <th scope="col">false</th>
                <th scope="col">true</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <th>Left curtain rectangle</th>
                <td>Fill the left half by setting the width <em>width</em> to half the parent's width</td>
                <td>Width of zero makes the rectangle invisible</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Right curtain rectangle</th>
                <td>Fill the right half by setting <em>x</em> and <em>width</em> to half of the parent's width</td>
                <td><em>width</em> of zero makes the rectangle invisible. <em>x</em> is moved to the right,
                    to slide the curtain open when animated</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    
    <p>In order to make our tile extensible, the hard-coded icon name is replaced with an <em>icon</em>
        property that can be set from the outside when instantiating the element. For the final polish, we add a
        <em>solved</em> property that we use to animate the color to a shade of green when we've found a pair, later. We
        replace the code inside the <code>sixtyfps!</code> macro with the following:</p>

    <pre><code>MemoryTile := Rectangle {
    signal clicked;
    property &lt;bool&gt; open_curtain;
    property &lt;bool&gt; solved;
    property &lt;resource&gt; icon;

    height: 64px;
    width: 64px;
    color: solved ? #34CE57 : #3960D5;
    animate color { duration: 800ms; }

    
    Image {
        source: icon;
        width: parent.width;
        height: parent.height;
    }

    // Left curtain
    Rectangle {
        color: #193076;
        width: open_curtain ? 0px : (parent.width / 2);
        height: parent.height;
        animate width { duration: 250ms; easing: ease-in; }
    }

    // Right curtain
    Rectangle {
        color: #193076;
        x: open_curtain ? parent.width : (parent.width / 2);
        width: open_curtain ? 0px : (parent.width / 2);
        height: parent.height;
        animate width { duration: 250ms; easing: ease-in; }
        animate x { duration: 250ms; easing: ease-in; }
    }

    TouchArea {
        clicked =&gt; {
            // Delegate to the user of this element
            root.clicked();
        }
    }
}
MainWindow := Window {
    MemoryTile {
        icon: img!"icons/bus.png";
        clicked =&gt; {
            self.open_curtain = !self.open_curtain;
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>Note the use of <code>root</code> and <code>self</code> in the code. <code>root</code> refers to the outermost
    element in the component, that's the <code>MemoryTile</code> in this case. <code>self</code> refers
    to the current element.</p>



    <h3>From One To Multiple Tiles</h3>


    <p>
        After modeling a single tile, let's create a grid of them. For the grid to be our game board, we need two features:
    
    </p><ol>
        <li>A data model: This shall be an array where each element describes the tile data structure, such as the
            url of the image, whether the image shall be visible and if this tile has been solved. We modify the model
            from Rust code.</li>
        <li>A way of creating many instances of the tiles, with the above <code>.60</code> markup code.</li>
    </ol>
    
    
    <p>
        In SixtyFPS we can declare an array of structures using brackets, to create a model. We can use the <code>for</code> loop to create many instances of the same element. In <code>.60</code> the
        for loop is declarative and automatically updates when the model changes. We instantiate all the different
        <code>MemoryTile</code> elements and place them on a grid based on their index with a
        little bit of spacing between the tiles.
    </p>
    
    <p>First, we copy the tile data structure definition and paste it at top inside the <code>sixtyfps!</code> macro:</p>

    <pre><code>sixtyfps::sixtyfps!{

// Added:
struct TileData := {
    image: resource,
    image_visible: bool,
    solved: bool,
}

MemoryTile := Rectangle {
// ...
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Next, we replace the <em><code>MainWindow</code> := { ... }</em> section
        at the bottom of the <code>sixtyfps!</code> macro with the following snippet:</p>

    <pre>        <code>MainWindow := Window {
    width: 326px;
    height: 326px;

    property &lt;[TileData]&gt; memory_tiles: [
       { image: img!"icons/at.png" },
       { image: img!"icons/balance-scale.png" },
       { image: img!"icons/bicycle.png" },
       { image: img!"icons/bus.png" },
       { image: img!"icons/cloud.png" },
       { image: img!"icons/cogs.png" },
       { image: img!"icons/motorcycle.png" },
       { image: img!"icons/video.png" },
    ];
    for tile[i] in memory_tiles : MemoryTile {
        x: mod(i, 4) * 74px;
        y: floor(i / 4) * 74px;
        width: 64px;
        height: 64px;
        icon: tile.image;
        open_curtain: tile.image_visible || tile.solved;
        // propagate the solved status from the model to the tile
        solved: tile.solved;
        clicked =&gt; {
            tile.image_visible = !tile.image_visible;
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>
 The <code><span>for</span> tile[i] <span>in memory_tiles :</span></code> syntax
        declares a variable <code>tile</code> which contains the data of one element from the <code>memory_tiles</code> array,
        and a variable <code>i</code> which is the index of the tile. We use the <code>i</code> index to calculate the position
        of tile based on its row and column, using the modulo and integer division to create a 4 by 4 grid.
        </p>



<h3>Creating The Tiles From Rust</h3>

<p>The tiles in the game should have a random placement. We'll need to add the <code>rand</code> dependency to
    <code>Cargo.toml</code> for the randomization.</p>

<pre><code>[dependencies]
sixtyfps = "0.0.4"
rand = "0.7" # Added
</code></pre>

<p>What we'll do is take the list of tiles declared in the .60 language, duplicate it, and shuffle it.
    We'll do so by accessing the <code>memory_tiles</code> property through the Rust code. For each
top-level property, a getter and a setter function is generated - in our case <code>get_memory_tiles</code>
and <code>set_memory_tiles</code>. Since <code>memory_tiles</code> is an array in the .60
language, it is represented as a
<code>Rc&lt;dyn <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/trait.model">sixtyfps::Model</a>&gt;</code>.
We can't modify the model generated by the .60, but we can extract the tiles from it, and put it
in a <code><a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/struct.vecmodel">VecModel</a></code> which
implements the <code>Model</code> trait. <code>VecModel</code> allows us to make modifications and we
can use it to replace the static generated model.
<br>
We modify the main …</p></div></section></div></div>

<p>Earlier to today, news of a leaked CCP database sent shockwaves around the world as we learned the names of 1.95 million Chinese communist party members. The <a href="https://electionwiz.com/2020/12/13/breaking-major-leak-exposes-chinese-communist-members-working-inside-western-companies/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://electionwiz.com/2020/12/13/breaking-major-leak-exposes-chinese-communist-members-working-inside-western-companies/">report</a> showed massive communist infiltration in Western firms and governments, including the United States. </p>



<p><strong><a href="realted: %E2%80%98major leak%E2%80%99 exposes Chinese Communist members working inside western companies">REALTED: ‘major leak’ exposes Chinese Communist members working inside western companies</a></strong></p>



<p>The database listed the names and information in Mandarin, but has since been translated to English. </p>







<p><strong>We now have the names in English…</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The overwhelming majority of people do not seem to care about privacy. They ask why they should care if they have “nothing to hide”. Yet this idea of hiding is fundamentally flawed.</p>

<p>The United Nations <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy" rel="nofollow">state</a> that privacy is a human right, just like the right to education is. So why on earth would you give that up? The famous (and somewhat obligatory) quote from Edward Snowden, the NSA whistleblower:</p>

<blockquote><p>Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.</p></blockquote>

<p>The question about privacy is not about hiding, it is about sharing. It is not that I have nothing to hide, I just do not have anything I want to share, especially unknowingly.&nbsp;This whole narrative that privacy is only for nefarious people is pushed by those who quite clearly care alot about privacy. Mark Zuckerberg spent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/11/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-neighbouring-houses" rel="nofollow">tens of millions of dollars</a> buying the houses that surrounded his home, for example. The irony is painful.</p>

<p>We all care about our privacy, though we might not know it. It is why we lock the door when we go to the toilet; or why we close the curtains to stop people looking into our homes.</p>

<p>In her essay for Aeon Magazine, Carissa Véliz <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/privacy-matters-because-it-empowers-us-all" rel="nofollow">argued</a> that privacy is power. It is the power “to show you ads... and to predict your behaviour”. But it is also the power to influence. Increasingly, Big Tech, the likes of Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, are sharing more and more information with governments. In turn, governments are starting to learn more and more about their citizens. Facebook allows governments to arrest people planning to participate in protests before they have even begun – and this is the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>Our privacy is eroding. As a society, we are beginning to accept this lack of privacy to be normal – and this is extremely dangerous. Privacy provides a place for us to be ourselves, to express ourselves in new ways without fear of being judged by preying eyes. If we lose privacy then we lose this ability to experiment, and, more importantly, we lose our power.</p>

<p>The war is not lost, however. We paved the path for Big Tech, though we no longer have to follow it. If we change our actions then a lot can be achieved. In most instances, alternatives to mainstream products, such as Google, are available. <a href="https://privacytools.io/" rel="nofollow">PrivacyTools.io</a> is a website, of which I am a team member, designed to showcase tools and knowledge to protect your privacy, along with housing a wonderful community of like minded privacy advocates. By simply switching to a few of the recommended services and installing some of the recommended add-ons we can slowly reverse the damage that was done. Furthermore, if you live in the EU, you can use your rights under GDPR to ensure all data that companies have on you is erased.</p>

<p>Privacy matters, regardless of who you are. We seriously need to start protecting it.</p>

      <p>Die Innenminister der EU-Mitgliedsstaaten haben die heftig umstrittenen Schlussfolgerungen zu "Sicherheit durch VerschlÃ¼sselung und Sicherheit trotz VerschlÃ¼sselung" des Rats bei ihrer virtuellen Sitzung am Montag ohne weitere Aussprache angenommen. Sie billigten damit trotz massiver Proteste aus Wirtschaft, Wissenschaft und Zivilgesellschaft den finalen Entwurf der deutschen, Ende des Jahres auslaufenden RatsprÃ¤sidentschaft.</p>

</a-paternoster>


<h3 id="nav_umstrittene__0">Umstrittene HintertÃ¼ren und GeneralschlÃ¼ssel</h3>
<p>Kernpunkt der <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-13084-2020-REV-1/en/pdf" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">endgÃ¼ltigen Version vom 24. November</a> ist der Gedanke, dass fÃ¼r SicherheitsbehÃ¶rden eine Form des auÃŸergewÃ¶hnlichen Zugriffs auf verschlÃ¼sselte Daten im Klartext mÃ¶glich sein sollte und kÃ¶nnte. Diese Idee haben unter anderem Geheimdienste wie die NSA und das GCHQ Ã¼ber den sogenannten Five-Eyes-Verbund sowie das FBI <a href="https://www.heise.de/hintergrund/Missing-Link-Crypto-Wars-der-endlose-Streit-ueber-sichere-Verschluesselung-4967574.html">in den laufenden Crypto Wars</a> propagiert.</p>
<p>Grundlegende SicherheitsmÃ¤ngel fÃ¼r alle anderen Nutzer eines Dienstes oder einer Technologie sollen laut der seit Jahren gefÃ¼hrten Debatte Ã¼ber Vorder- und HintertÃ¼ren sowie Universal- oder NachschlÃ¼ssel nach offizieller Lesart nicht geschaffen werden. Techniker verweisen eine solche "magische LÃ¶sung" aber ins Reich der MÃ¤rchen, da es "ein bisschen verschlÃ¼sselt" nicht gibt.</p>

  <a-script name="132" needs-consent="" src="https://a.teads.tv/page/86789/tag"></a-script>
  


<h3 id="nav_gesellschaft__1">Gesellschaft und BÃ¼rger "auch online schÃ¼tzen"</h3>
<p>Der Rat will nun trotzdem <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Crypto-Wars-Deutsche-EU-Ratspraesidentschaft-will-Beihilfe-zur-Entschluesselung-4940927.html">auf die Beihilfe von Dienstanbietern wie Apple, Facebook, Google, Threema, Signal oder WhatsApp beim EntschlÃ¼sseln elektronischer Kommunikation</a> setzen. "VerschlÃ¼sselung ist ein notwendiges Mittel zum Schutz der Grundrechte und der digitalen Sicherheit von Regierungen, Industrie und Gesellschaft", <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2020/12/14/encryption-council-adopts-resolution-on-security-through-encryption-and-security-despite-encryption/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">heiÃŸt es in der EntschlieÃŸung</a>. Gleichzeitig mÃ¼sse die EU aber sicherstellen, dass die "zustÃ¤ndigen BehÃ¶rden im Bereich Sicherheit und Strafjustiz" â€“ inklusive Geheimdiensten â€“ ihre "gesetzlichen Befugnisse" ausÃ¼ben und "sowohl online als auch offline unsere Gesellschaften" und BÃ¼rger schÃ¼tzen kÃ¶nnen.</p>

  
    <a-script name="488" needs-consent="" src="https://widgets.opinary.com/embed.js"></a-script>
  





<p>Diese ZwiespÃ¤ltigkeit, die schon im Titel der Resolution angelegt ist, zieht sich durch das ganze Dokument. "Ganz offensichtlich kommen VerschlÃ¼sselungstechnologien allen Seiten zugute", meinen die Regierungsvertreter. "Es werden nicht nur elektronische GerÃ¤te und Anwendungen zunehmend so programmiert, dass sie gespeicherte Nutzerdaten standardmÃ¤ÃŸig verschlÃ¼sseln". Auch immer mehr KommunikationskanÃ¤le und Datenspeicherdienste wÃ¼rden durch Ende-zu-Ende-VerschlÃ¼sselung gesichert.</p>






  


  <a-ad height="250" instant="" layout="responsive" media="(min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 767px)" preload-distance="200" safeframe="" sizes="300x50,300x75,300x100,300x150,300x250,320x50,320x75,320x100,320x250,fluid" targeting="{&quot;kw&quot;:[&quot;Crypto Wars&quot;,&quot;Datenschutz&quot;,&quot;EU&quot;,&quot;Sicherheit&quot;,&quot;Trojaner&quot;,&quot;VerschlÃ¼sselung&quot;],&quot;mpos&quot;:[&quot;2&quot;],&quot;themenhub&quot;:&quot;yes&quot;}" type="gpt" unit="/6514/www.heise.de/newsticker/news-internet" width="300"></a-ad>



<h3 id="nav__quot_rechtmÃ¤ÃŸig__2">"RechtmÃ¤ÃŸiger Zugang" fÃ¼r BehÃ¶rden per Gesetz nÃ¶tig</h3>
<p>Die Digitalisierung moderner Gesellschaften bringt laut der Deklaration aber auch "gewisse Schwachstellen und das Potenzial einer Ausbeutung fÃ¼r kriminelle Zwecke mit sich". So kÃ¶nnten StraftÃ¤ter "leicht zugÃ¤ngliche, herkÃ¶mmliche VerschlÃ¼sselungslÃ¶sungen, die fÃ¼r rechtmÃ¤ÃŸige Zwecke konzipiert sind, fÃ¼r ihre Vorgehensweisen nutzen". Gleichzeitig hÃ¤nge die Strafverfolgung zunehmend vom Zugang zu elektronischen Beweismitteln ab, um Terrorismus, organisierte KriminalitÃ¤t, sexuellen Missbrauch von Kindern sowie eine Vielzahl anderer Cyberstraftaten wirksam zu bekÃ¤mpfen.</p>
<p>UnabhÃ¤ngig vom derzeitigen technologischen Umfeld ist es dem Rat zufolge daher unerlÃ¤sslich, die Befugnisse der zustÃ¤ndigen BehÃ¶rden "durch rechtmÃ¤ÃŸigen Zugang zu wahren". NÃ¶tig seien gegebenenfalls Gesetze, mit denen diese auf dem Papier schon bestehenden Kompetenzen auch praktisch durchgesetzt werden kÃ¶nnten. Diese mÃ¼ssten "im vollen Einklang mit einem ordnungsgemÃ¤ÃŸen Verfahren und anderen Garantien sowie den Grundrechten stehen". Die unterschiedlichen Interessen seien sorgfÃ¤ltig abzuwÃ¤gen.</p>
<h3 id="nav_einheitliche__3">Einheitliche technische LÃ¶sung wohl nicht machbar</h3>
<p>Die EU zeigt sich laut der ErklÃ¤rung nun bestrebt, "in einen aktiven Dialog mit der Technologiebranche einzutreten und dabei Forschung und Wissenschaft einzubeziehen". Dabei gelte es, einerseits den Einsatz starker VerschlÃ¼sselungstechnologien und die Cybersicherheit zu gewÃ¤hrleisten. Andererseits mÃ¼ssten SicherheitsbehÃ¶rden "unter uneingeschrÃ¤nkter Achtung der Grundrechte und der einschlÃ¤gigen Datenschutzgesetze rechtmÃ¤ÃŸig und gezielt auf Daten zugreifen kÃ¶nnen". DafÃ¼r seien grundrechtskompatible "technische LÃ¶sungen" nÃ¶tig.</p>
<p>Vage wird in dem Papier festgehalten, dass die Notwendigkeit, einen entsprechenden EU-weiten Regelungsrahmen zu entwickeln, weiter bewertet werden "kÃ¶nnte". Dies soll offenbar nahelegen, dass eine zusÃ¤tzliche Analyse nicht mehr zwingend fÃ¼r kÃ¼nftige gesetzgeberische Schritte nÃ¶tig ist. Es sei vor allem wichtig, die BemÃ¼hungen aller LÃ¤nder, Organe und Institutionen der EU zu bÃ¼ndeln. Eine "einheitliche vorgeschriebene technische LÃ¶sung fÃ¼r den Zugang zu verschlÃ¼sselten Daten" sieht der Rat aber als nicht machbar an.</p>
<h3 id="nav_kaum__4">Kaum verÃ¤nderter Entwurf trotz Kritik beschlossen</h3>
<p>Die Bundesregierung hatte mit frÃ¼heren EntwÃ¼rfen eine <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Terrorbekaempfung-und-Verschluesselung-EU-Rat-forciert-umstrittene-Crypto-Linie-4960069.html">Welle der Kritik ausgelÃ¶st</a>, zuletzt aber nur noch Nuancen am Text geÃ¤ndert. Das Innenministerium <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Crypto-Wars-Bundesregierung-verteidigt-EU-Linie-zur-Entschluesselung-4984108.html">verteidigt den Kurs damit</a>, dass der Einsatz von Staatstrojanern zum Umgehen von VerschlÃ¼sselung zu aufwÃ¤ndig und so meist nicht praktikabel sei. Unter anderem die Datenschutzkonferenz von Bund und LÃ¤ndern hatte die Zugriffsforderungen entschieden zurÃ¼ckgewiesen. Die "AushÃ¶hlung von VerschlÃ¼sselungslÃ¶sungen", wie sie der Ratsbeschluss nahelege, sei kontraproduktiv und kÃ¶nnte durch Kriminelle und Terroristen leicht umgangen werden. Die Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Informatik hatte beklagt: Die Initiative gefÃ¤hrde nicht nur die informationelle Selbstbestimmung, sondern auch den Schutz von Betriebs- und GeschÃ¤ftsgeheimnissen.</p>
<p>Die EU-Kommission <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Anti-Terror-Agenda-EU-Kommission-sucht-Mittelweg-gegen-Verschluesselung-4985264.html">hat sich mit ihrer Anti-Terror-Agenda bereits hinter die RatserklÃ¤rung gestellt</a>. Sie will nun vor allem im Kampf gegen die Verbreitung von Missbrauchsdarstellungen <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/EU-Kommission-Mit-Hashabgleich-und-TPM-gegen-Ende-zu-Ende-Verschluesselung-4889729.html">LÃ¶sungen fÃ¼r den Zugang zu Nachrichten im Klartext ausloten</a>, die <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Bundestagsstudie-EU-Vorschlag-zum-Umgehen-von-Verschluesselung-taugt-nicht-4980983.html">IT-Sicherheitsexperten aber bislang als untauglich einschÃ¤tzen</a>. HintertÃ¼ren schlieÃŸt sie bei dem von ihr fÃ¼r mÃ¶glich erachteten "Mittelweg" nicht aus. Europol betreibt schon eine <a href="https://www.heise.de/meldung/Crypto-Wars-Europol-soll-Europas-Ermittlern-bei-Entschluesselung-helfen-3914261.html">Plattform zur EntschlÃ¼sselung</a> nach dem Vorbild der deutschen HackerbehÃ¶rde Zitis.</p>

The answer to this questions should be one that you know, and you can provide with certainty and authentic conviction. Make use of the elevator pitch, excite the investor with an engaging answer that sparks their curiosity to learn more.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Why did you pick this idea to work on?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="pwj5nk" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pzojfp" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pw9bdv" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>Again, keep your questions short and to the point during investor meetings. This is a great opportunity to explain your motivation as to why you are working on this. Make sure to convey clear reasons and back them up with some domain expertise or background experience that makes you the perfect team to work on this idea. don’t forget to express your enthusiasm and excitement your cary within to be bring this idea to life. Investors like to hear that you are passionate about what you do.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div>  <div> <div> <div data-id="pfrdpb" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="p76drh" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pcqqvd" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>The investor likes to know if you can prove that you have a truly unique value proposition. You have been working on this idea for a while now and did your research, you should definitely be able to explain properly how you differ from others in the market. First of all, express how you and your team are different than any other team to execute on this. Explain the in-house expertise, motivation, and amazing team collaboration to achieve results. Second, you found a unique solution to the customer’s problem through innovative (proprietary) technology, product development, or service offering unlike anything in the market today.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>What big problem do you solve?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="p5m277" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="p729kq" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pwq1v6" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>When an investor asks you this question, get ready to emphasize clearly that the problem your solving is HUGE! You are on a mission to solve a problem that will change the way people do certain things and it will have a tremendous impact. Make sure to state some short key facts why this true so you’re not just blowing this up. The reason why you want to answer it in this way, is because the bigger the problem, the more likely people are willing to pay.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>What is unique about the company?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="pswh74" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pt3l1o" data-type="column"> <div data-id="prc0cw" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>Although this question ties in closely with “how are you different?” they are not entirely the same question. This is your opportunity to really focus on what makes your company unique. It might be your proprietary innovative technology that makes your company unique. It could be that your team has amazing set of skills unlike any other team. Or, it could be that your company strategized towards problems and opportunities just a bit different than others. Focus, focus, focus – let them know that <i>you know</i> what is unique about your company.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Why is your business defensible?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="pc026o" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pg1ie5" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pf29xp" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>The investor is looking for some reassurance that your business and product/service is not one that will be copied easily. You defensibility could be your go-to-market strategy or scaling strategy. Defensibility could also come from the team you assemble or the technology you are building. Explain how your business is one that can’t be easily copied and executed. Even if the idea can be copied by another company, they will not have the team you have to execute successfully. There is and should always be a clear confident answer to this question.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>What do you understand that others don’t?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="p4hpcs" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pu9ezu" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pnji6p" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>You certainly did your market research, spoke to customers, or have a background in a certain industry or field that gave you an understanding of the problem or opportunity you are working on.

However, do not lie or give vague answers as to when you expect profits. This will only complicate things later and will make you look like you failed when you don’t reach those conversions.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <div>
              <div>
              <p>Developers spend most of their time reading code, understanding it and exploring other ways to use existing solutions. Frankly, in our profession, there is very little time on actually writing new libraries and creating new interfaces in real-life development. So it is quite important to have some help in the most common activities. <strong>Naming conventions</strong> is one such thing that improves readability and eases the usage cost if agreed upon and spread worldwide.</p>
<p>Some languages have their own special naming conventions that make sense. Haskell is among them. There are a bunch of naming patterns that are commonly used everywhere in the ecosystem (including the standard libraries) that may help you to recognise the function’s meaning without looking at its documentation and even its type! This ability is especially relevant because naming is one of the hardest development problems, so having some help and no-brainer rules to guide in this area improves everyone’s life.</p>
<p>In this post, we will explore common naming conventions in Haskell together. It is going to be useful for both creators (library and API developers) and consumers (library users), as it establishes norms accepted in the libraries’ APIs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🦋 If you are interested in other conventions and best practices on how to write Haskell code, you can take a look at our <a href="https://kowainik.github.io/posts/2019-02-06-style-guide">style guide</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="checked">Checked<a href="#checked">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Let’s start with the conventional and straightforward norms established in Haskell’s specifications and standards. Names in Haskell must satisfy the following simple rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Types and typeclasses</strong> must start with an <em>uppercase</em> letter</li>
<li><strong>Functions and variables</strong> must start with a <em>lowercase</em> letter</li>
<li><strong>Top-level operator functions</strong> must start with any allowed symbol except for <code>:</code></li>
<li><strong>Constructors as operators</strong> must start with <code>:</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These rules are in the specifications and therefore checked by the compiler. So if you try to break the naming rules, you will get errors during the compilation.</p>
<p>Additionally, functions follow the <strong>lowerCamelCase</strong> style and types follow the <strong>UpperCamelCase</strong> style. This is the de facto standard of writing code in Haskell, but using distinct styles doesn’t lead to a compiler error. Moreover, there are some testing libraries that use <em>snake_case </em>to discover tests automatically. However, you can restrict that with the Haskell tooling, e.g.&nbsp;HLint can check this for you.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are various details in the names that will give you hints on what the function does. We will walk through them to learn to recognise them all.</p>
<h2 id="type-variables">Type variables<a href="#type-variables">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Let’s start our excursions with the type variables that are most commonly used in type signatures and definitions. Some variables represent particular meaning: it could be a typeclass-related convention or just a convenient shorter usage. But in any way, this information is useful to know while reading and writing types:</p>
<div>
<p><code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, …</p>
<div>
<p>Ordinary type variables with no particular meaning</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>map</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [b]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>f</code></p>
<div>
<p><code>Functor</code> or <code>Applicative</code></p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> <span>Functor</span> f <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> f a <span>-&gt;</span> f b</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>m</code></p>
<div>
<p><code>Monad</code> or <code>Semigroup</code>/<code>Monoid</code></p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>(&gt;&gt;=) ::</span> <span>Monad</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> m a <span>-&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> m b) <span>-&gt;</span> m b</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><span>(&lt;&gt;) ::</span> <span>Semigroup</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> m <span>-&gt;</span> m <span>-&gt;</span> m</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>e</code></p>
<div>
<p>Types representing errors</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>failures ::</span> [<span>Validation</span> e a] <span>-&gt;</span> [e]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>t</code></p>
<div>
<p><code>Foldable</code> or <code>Traversable</code></p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>concat</span><span> ::</span> <span>Foldable</span> t <span>=&gt;</span> t [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>or types of kind <code>Type</code> (previously <code>*</code>)</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>Size</span> (<span>t ::</span> <span>Type</span>) <span>=</span> <span>Size</span> <span>Int</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>k</code></p>
<div>
<p>Kind</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>type</span> <span>family</span> (<span>++</span>) (<span>xs ::</span> [k]) (<span>ys ::</span> [k])<span> ::</span> [k]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="function-variables">Function variables<a href="#function-variables">🔗</a></h2>
<p>The way we name arguments and variables in functions is also not accidental. They contain hints that make reading these variables used in function bodies easier. Variables in functions use the following established commonly used names:</p>
<div>
<p><code>l</code></p>
<p>Lists variable</p>
<p><code>(x:xs)</code> or <code>(y:ys)</code></p>
<div>
<p>Patterns for lists where <code>x</code> means a single x and <code>xs</code> means <em>many <code>x</code>s</em></p>
<p>Also used together with the previous one with as-patterns:</p>

</div>
<p><code>f</code>, <code>g</code>, <code>h</code></p>
<div>
<p>Function arguments</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>map</span> f (x<span>:</span>xs) <span>=</span> f x <span>:</span> <span>map</span> f xs</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>p</code></p>
<div>
<p>Functions which are predicates (e.g.&nbsp;of type <code>Int -&gt; Bool</code>)</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><span>bar ::</span> (<span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2">bar p i <span>=</span> <span>...</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>n</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code></p>
<p>Miscellaneous counters</p>
<p><code>len</code></p>
<p>Container size</p>
<p><code>go</code></p>

</div>
<h2 id="suffixes">Suffixes<a href="#suffixes">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Suffix in a Haskell function can contain a lot of information about its purpose. Sometimes you would see multiple different suffixes simultaneously that combine the characteristics of each piece, so it is helpful to pay attention to that.</p>
<h4 id="apostrophe">Apostrophe ’<a href="#apostrophe">🔗</a></h4>
<p>The <code>'</code> symbol is used in the functions, for which there is a corresponding function without the apostrophe, e.g.&nbsp;<code>foo</code> and <code>foo'</code>.</p>
<p>The apostrophe at the end means that it’s a <strong>strict</strong> version of a similar function. Both functions must have the same type, but different implementations underneath. The only difference in their behaviour is that the one with the <code>'</code> symbol evaluates intermediate results more eagerly.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><span>foldMap</span><span>  ::</span> (<span>Foldable</span> t, <span>Monoid</span> m) <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> m) <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> m</span>
<span id="cb11-2"><span>foldMap' ::</span> (<span>Foldable</span> t, <span>Monoid</span> m) <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> m) <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> m</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, both functions have the same type. But <code>foldMap'</code> is more efficient and helps to avoid space leaks when monoidal operation <code>&lt;&gt;</code> is strict in both arguments.</p>
<h3 id="typeclasses">Typeclasses<a href="#typeclasses">🔗</a></h3>
<p>There is a group of symbols that is used to indicate that the function returns the value in some context. This suffix – an uppercase letter or word – tells us the typeclass this context should represent.</p>
<p>Meet the <code>FAM</code>ily 👩‍👩‍👦‍👦</p>
<h4 id="f">F<a href="#f">🔗</a></h4>
<p>The suffix <code>F</code> suggests that it works with <code>Functor</code>s in some way.</p>
<p>Such functions can have an alternative without the suffix <code>F</code>.</p>
<p>Example from the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers">containers</a> library:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1">alter</span>
<span id="cb12-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>Ord</span> k</span>
<span id="cb12-3">    <span>=&gt;</span> (<span>Maybe</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> a)</span>
<span id="cb12-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> k</span>
<span id="cb12-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Map</span> k a</span>
<span id="cb12-6">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Map</span> k a</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1">alterF</span>
<span id="cb13-2"><span>    ::</span> (<span>Functor</span> f, <span>Ord</span> k)</span>
<span id="cb13-3">    <span>=&gt;</span> (<span>Maybe</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> f (<span>Maybe</span> a))</span>
<span id="cb13-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> k</span>
<span id="cb13-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Map</span> k a</span>
<span id="cb13-6">    <span>-&gt;</span> f (<span>Map</span> k a)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>However, sometimes the suffix <code>F</code> has an alternative meaning. <code>F</code> frequently used as a suffix in formatting libraries to indicate that a function is a <em>formatter</em> or a <em>pretty-printer</em>.</p>
<p>Example from the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fmt">fmt</a> library:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><span>timeF ::</span> <span>FormatTime</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Text</span> <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>BuilderSource</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can see how the same naming can have different meanings. What’s important is that the library establishes its naming convention explicitly and uses it consistently.</p>
<h4 id="a">A<a href="#a">🔗</a></h4>
<p>The suffix <code>A</code> means that the function works with some general <code>Applicative</code> type (the type that has the <code>Applicative</code> instance).</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1"><span>sequenceA</span><span> ::</span> (<span>Traversable</span> t, <span>Applicative</span> f) <span>=&gt;</span> t (f a) <span>-&gt;</span> f (t a)</span></code></pre></div>
<h4 id="m">M<a href="#m">🔗</a></h4>
<p>The suffix <code>M</code> is among the most common ones. It usually means that the function works with the <code>Monad</code>s or in the monadic context.</p>
<p>Similarly to the previous suffixes, functions <em>with</em> <code>M</code> have their counterparts <em>without</em> <code>M</code>:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div id="cb16"><pre><code><span id="cb16-1"><span>filter</span></span>
<span id="cb16-2"></span>
<span id="cb16-3"><span>    ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>)</span>
<span id="cb16-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb16-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="cb17"><pre><code><span id="cb17-1">filterM</span>
<span id="cb17-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>Applicative</span> m</span>
<span id="cb17-3">    <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> m <span>Bool</span>)</span>
<span id="cb17-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb17-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> m [a]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Historically, the standard Haskell library <code>base</code> didn’t have <code>Applicative</code> functors, and there weren’t the superclass of Monads. But now the suffix <code>M</code> is also sometimes used with Applicative functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="underscore-_">Underscore _<a href="#underscore-_">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Underscore, as a suffix of functions, also has a special meaning. It gives us a clue that the function works exactly as the one without <code>_</code> but discards the result (returns <code>()</code> instead).</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div id="cb18"><pre><code><span id="cb18-1">concurrently</span>
<span id="cb18-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>IO</span> a</span>
<span id="cb18-3">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> b</span>
<span id="cb18-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> (a, b)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="cb19"><pre><code><span id="cb19-1">concurrently_</span>
<span id="cb19-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>IO</span> a</span>
<span id="cb19-3">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> b</span>
<span id="cb19-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> ()</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<h3 id="number">Number<a href="#number">🔗</a></h3>
<p>You can often see the series of functions with the numbers at the end of their names. These groups have the same initial part but differ with the number. Numbers there represent the <strong>number of arguments</strong> each function takes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🔢 The number 1 is not used usually in that meaning as it’s redundant.</p>
</blockquote>
<div>
<div>
<div id="cb20"><pre><code><span id="cb20-1"><span>liftA  ::</span> <span>Applicative</span> f</span>

</div>
</div>
<p>Number 1 has a special meaning of requiring at least one argument to be present in a container:</p>
<div id="cb26"><pre><code><span id="cb26-1"><span>foldr</span><span>  ::</span> <span>Foldable</span> t <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> b</span>
<span id="cb26-2"><span>foldr1</span><span> ::</span> <span>Foldable</span> t <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> a) <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Though, the fact that it works with <code>Foldable</code> is not ideal. There is <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/13573">a proposal</a> to implement a typeclass called <code>Foldable</code> (or <code>Semifoldable</code>) for non-empty types.</p>
<h3 id="lr">L/R<a href="#lr">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The suffixes <code>L</code> and <code>R</code> (sometimes <code>l</code> and <code>r</code>) represent the direction of function application or order of traversing a data structure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ℹ️ Most of the time, these sibling functions have the same type, but in some functions, certain arguments are reversed for convenience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples:</p>
<div id="cb27"><pre><code><span id="cb27-1"><span>foldr</span><span> ::</span> <span>Foldable</span> t <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> b</span>

<span id="cb27-3"></span>
<span id="cb27-4"><span>scanr</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [b]</span>
<span id="cb27-5"><span>scanl</span><span> ::</span> (b <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [b]</span>
<span id="cb27-6"></span>
<span id="cb27-7"><span>mapAccumR ::</span> <span>Traversable</span> t <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> (a, c)) <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> t b <span>-&gt;</span> (a, t c)</span>
<span id="cb27-8"><span>mapAccumL ::</span> <span>Traversable</span> t <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> (a, c)) <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> t b <span>-&gt;</span> (a, t c)</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="byon">By/On<a href="#byon">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Some of the overloaded functions that work with <code>Foldable</code>s or lists have a non-overloaded sibling with the suffix <code>By</code>.</p>
<p>It is often convenient to use these functions together with <code>on</code>, for instance:</p>
<div id="cb28"><pre><code><span id="cb28-1">sortBy (<span>compare</span> <span>`on`</span> <span>fst</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This <code>on</code> pattern is so widely used, so functions also have the suffix <code>On</code>.</p>
<p>Compare these three types:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div id="cb29"><pre><code><span id="cb29-1"><span>sort</span></span>
<span id="cb29-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>Ord</span> a</span>
<span id="cb29-3"></span>
<span id="cb29-4">    <span>=&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb29-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="cb30"><pre><code><span id="cb30-1">sortBy</span>
<span id="cb30-2"></span>
<span id="cb30-3"><span>    ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Ordering</span>)</span>
<span id="cb30-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb30-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="cb31"><pre><code><span id="cb31-1">sortOn</span>
<span id="cb31-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>Ord</span> b</span>

<span id="cb31-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb31-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<h3 id="p">P<a href="#p">🔗</a></h3>
<p>In some libraries or applications’ code, the suffix <code>P</code> shows that the function is a parser of some type, e.g.&nbsp;when using the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optparse-applicative">optparse-applicative</a> library. The usage of this naming convention can look like this:</p>
<div id="cb32"><pre><code><span id="cb32-1"><span>data</span> <span>Config</span> <span>=</span> <span>Config</span></span>
<span id="cb32-2">    {<span> configPort ::</span> <span>Port</span></span>
<span id="cb32-3">    ,<span> configPath ::</span> <span>FilePath</span></span>

                    <p><strong>Confusing UI design = Recipe for Disaster</strong> – &nbsp;Setting up 2FA on our PayPal business account was exactly that. Usually most payment providers make 2FA a mandate in the setup process, or, at least asks its users to set it up during sign up itself, but PayPal doesn't. I have no complaints about PayPal's Infosec standards as they have been running a successful bug bounty program on Hackerone and seem to have a very responsive and active security team. </p><h2 id="update">Update</h2><p>We did some more research and found out this problem has been there for more than 2 years now yet no action from PayPal's end – <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/paypal/comments/7teop7/twofactor_auth">https://www.reddit.com/r/paypal/comments/7teop7/twofactor_auth</a></p><p>We haven't received any response from PayPal yet but have gotten in touch with them regarding the same.</p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-4.png 600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image-4.png 1000w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-4.png 1525w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Users complaining about the issue on PayPal</figcaption></figure><h2 id="2fa-and-account-compromise">2FA and Account Compromise</h2><p>Setting up 2FA is really critical for account security, and PayPal accounts are no different – naturally, they are a more interesting target for hackers due to the price tag attached to them. Thus, enabling 2FA in the first place would be the most logical step to prevent unauthorized account intrusions and account hacks, as every log in would require a TOTP code from an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or, Authy as part of the 2FA process. However, I found this process really hard due to the confusing documentation on PayPal website. </p><p>The process to setup 2FA on PayPal for account security was by far the most difficult, time consuming and confusing process ever but when we get to it... you can realize how simple it could have actually been. Its the most important step to take to prevent getting your PayPal account hacked or, breached or, compromised. In this post, I have explained the full process and why it was so confusing.</p><p>PayPal's confusing UI design can become a threat to user account security &nbsp;as it makes it harder for users to setup 2FA for their accounts.</p><p>But it was, really... I mean <strong>REALLY</strong> difficult for me to locate their 2FA option. I couldn't spot it anywhere in their UI even after several Google searches about this, nothing showed up – whatever did was either too outdated or, totally useless or, deprecated. </p><p>Confused, I got in touch with their Customer Support who pointed me to their the <strong>Settings </strong>page, and told a <strong>Security </strong>page was located there. But... what? I couldn't find one. Weird, that's how difficult PayPal makes it to simply add an additional layer of security to your account. This made me wonder, why is it so difficult to enable a simple security feature like 2FA on PayPal? I tried everything, every button and navigation links on their Android and iOS apps too but failed to locate the 2FA setup page.</p><p>Utterly disappointed, when I came across <a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/smarthelp/article/-what-is-2-step-verification-faq4057?app=searchAutoComplete">this</a> Help Center Article which was disguised in the form of a general FAQ about 2FA but, finally I found that <a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/smarthelp/article/-what-is-2-step-verification-faq4057?app=searchAutoComplete">magic link</a>! – </p><figure><a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/smarthelp/article/-what-is-2-step-verification-faq4057?app=searchAutoComplete"><div><p>what-is-2-step-verification</p><p><img src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/webstatic/icon/pp196.png"></p></div></a></figure><p>Well, there's a catch. </p><h2 id="the-catch">The Catch</h2><p>When you are <strong>logged out</strong>, PayPal would show the following 2FA Setup process instructions in their <strong><a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/smarthelp/article/-what-is-2-step-verification-faq4057?app=searchAutoComplete">Documentation/Help Guide</a> – </strong></p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-1.png 600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image-1.png 1000w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/image-1.png 1600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-1.png 1637w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Logged-out 2FA Setup Guide</figcaption></figure><p>However, when you are <strong>logged in, </strong>the instructions asked you to go to profile page and setup 2FA from there – <a href="https://www.paypal.com/businessmanage/profile/loginSecurity">this</a> is the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/businessmanage/profile/loginSecurity">final link</a> that leads to the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/businessmanage/profile/loginSecurity">2FA setup process</a>.

<li>Click on <strong>Update</strong> after navigating to <strong>Login and Security</strong> page from PayPal Profile page navigation</li>

<li>Enter the TOTP code on PayPal website after adding PayPal in the Authenticator app,</li>
<li>You have succesffully added 2FA to your PayPal account. To make it more secure, you can go ahead and add SMS 2FA layer as extra defence too.</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Turns out PayPal might have done some UI revamping which effectively resulted in concealing the <strong>Security </strong>page's navigation from Account Settings page. The whole thing was pretty troublesome for me. But now that I was able to setup 2FA back again, I have got back my peace of mind back!</p><h3 id="how-the-paypal-cs-reacted">How the PayPal CS reacted</h3><p>However, for me it was even more disappointing was when even their customer support staff too failed to guide me in this regard – </p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-3.png 600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image-3.png 1000w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/image-3.png 1600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-3.png 1737w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>PayPal Customer Support's response</figcaption></figure><h2 id="no-2fa-setup-available-in-paypal-mobile-apps">No 2FA Setup available in PayPal Mobile Apps</h2><p>When I last checked, there was no 2FA setup option in the mobile app UI which is an eye sore. Every major payment provider allows merchants and business users to setup 2FA right from the mobile – but I couldn't find the option in either of the apps – neither Android nor iOS which is bad from a security and accessibility standpoint.</p><h2 id="my-opinion">My Opinion</h2><p>PayPal itself isn't insecure but these are what I call – classic business logic errors. The UI is the first step towards making a better application and give an overall good experience to the average consumer. Secondly, I had to face a not-so knowledgeable customer support staff who explained how to <strong>navigate to 2FA setup, </strong>but turns out that's not the actual way. I have spent probably tens of thousands of dollars <em>over</em>paying PayPal fees and this is what I get in terms of value for money or, my ROI, a bad user experience (UX). I'm not blaming anyone – but despite charging so much in fees, PayPal still hasn't been able to provide a proper UI/UX to its clients. There are several pain points in their UI, and nothing much has changed in most critical parts of their web app since the past 10-12 years, only some parts of the UI/UX has been revamped but some <strong>areas </strong>like 2FA setup are harder because of PayPal's extremely clunky and confusing UI.</p><p>If app developers don't design the UI properly, they can unintentionally cause losses on the part of their users – as in this case, a legitimate user couldn't setup 2FA on their account due to a buggy UI. I strongly feel UI and UX form a core part of an Application's security and not just the backend and frontend parts involving code. <strong>The UI features should encourage the user to enable more security features in the app, </strong>but in this case – it was misleading and confusing.</p><h2 id="harder-ui-more-security-issues-effectively">Harder UI = More Security Issues, effectively</h2><p>With harder UI in fine grained applications with varying levels of access controls, it becomes increasingly harder for users to manage account restrictions and security policies. As in this example, the <strong>Security </strong>page was hidden from the view which potentially makes a user account more susceptible to compromise. A better and smooth UI ensures a user is able to setup every security setting to optimal level. </p><p>Harder the UI = More the confusion on the part of the user. This can leave organization accounts open to breaches and evidently a lot of hackers are exploiting misconfigurations in application due to user ignorance.</p><h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2><p>The entire process was far more painstaking and confusing, than how simple it should have been on the contrary. Thus, making a more intuitive and proper UI is very important from user security point of view than a confusing feature-loaded loosely designed product. Also, security features like 2FA should be mandated in applications dealing with payments and high value transactions in general. Due to a UI revamp or, refactor, that missed putting into place the Security link in Navigation, users can miss the 2FA setup and for those using weak credentials can end up getting hand – which is how hundreds of thousands of PayPal accounts and Credit Card &nbsp;data aka <strong>Fullz </strong>end up getting hacked and sold on darknet marketplaces.</p><blockquote><em><strong>How we can help?</strong></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><strong><a href="https://savebreach.com/">SaveBreach</a></strong> conducts in-depth security research, bug hunting, and security consultancy.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I still need to write the blog post explaining “What is the Hidden Friend Idiom?”;
but for now, here’s a practical demonstration of its usefulness that just came up
on the cpplang Slack (thanks, Johan Lundberg!).</p>

<p>Consider this pair of class templates <code>Cat&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Dog&lt;T&gt;</code>. <code>Cat</code> is analogous to
the STL’s container templates, which define <code>operator&lt;</code> (or in C++20, <code>operator&lt;=&gt;</code>)
as a free function template.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>template&lt;class V&gt;
struct Cat {
    V value_;
};

template&lt;class V&gt;
bool operator&lt;(const Cat&lt;V&gt;&amp; a, const Cat&lt;V&gt;&amp; b) {
    return a.value_ &lt; b.value_;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>Dog</code> is how I <em>recommend</em> everyone write their
overloaded operators, as hidden friend non-templates.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>template&lt;class V&gt;
struct Dog {
    V value_;

    friend bool operator&lt;(const Dog&amp; a, const Dog&amp; b) {
        return a.value_ &lt; b.value_;
    }
};
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now consider the following “<code>sort_in_place</code>” algorithm, which
uses <code>reference_wrapper</code> to sort a vector of <em>handles pointing into</em>
its const argument vector, instead of sorting the argument vector
itself. (I’ve never found this trick useful in practice, but it’s
a very cute demonstration of how the different pieces of the STL
fit together. I use basically this code in the <code>reference_wrapper</code>
unit of my <a href="https://cppcon.org/class-2020-classic-stl/">“Classic STL”</a> training course.)</p>

<div><div><pre><code>template&lt;class T&gt;
void sort_in_place(const std::vector&lt;T&gt;&amp; vt) {
    std::vector&lt;std::reference_wrapper&lt;const T&gt;&gt; vr(vt.begin(), vt.end());
    std::sort(vr.begin(), vr.end());
    std::transform(vr.begin(), vr.end(),
        std::ostream_iterator&lt;int&gt;(std::cout), std::mem_fn(&amp;T::value_));
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/PscoPz">Godbolt.</a>)</p>

<p>We observe that <code>sort_in_place</code> works nicely for <code>Dog</code>. Whenever <code>std::sort</code>
needs to compute <code>a &lt; b</code>, where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are <code>reference_wrapper&lt;Dog&lt;int&gt;&gt;</code>,
it uses ADL to find our friend as a candidate, and then confirms that <code>reference_wrapper&lt;Dog&lt;int&gt;&gt;</code>
is indeed implicitly convertible to <code>const Dog&lt;int&gt;&amp;</code> for both arguments.</p>

<p>But <code>sort_in_place</code> fails for <code>Cat</code>! It still uses ADL to find our <code>operator&lt;</code>
template; but then template argument deduction requires that the provided argument types
exactly match the pattern specified by the template, which is not true in this case —
there is no <code>V</code> such that <code>Cat&lt;V&gt;</code> is <code>reference_wrapper&lt;Cat&lt;int&gt;&gt;</code>. Deduction fails.</p>

<p>We can manually call the proper specialization — the one with <code>V=int</code> — by writing
<code>operator&lt; &lt;int&gt;(vr[0], vr[1])</code>. (The space is important there!)
But we can’t write simply <code>vr[0] &lt; vr[1]</code> because of this poor interaction with
template argument deduction.</p>

<p>So <code>Dog</code>’s <code>operator&lt;</code> is better-designed than <code>Cat</code>’s, at least in this respect.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>For operator overloads, always prefer “hidden friend” non-templates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>main</em> benefits of the hidden friend idiom are that it avoids member operators’
asymmetrical treatment of the left and right operands, and that it shrinks overload sets
by not dumping free operators directly into the top-level namespace. This blog post
didn’t relate to either of those benefits.</p>

<p>The use of the hidden friend idiom in cases like <code>Dog</code> — specifically to create a
class template whose instantiations are associated with <em>non-template</em> friends —
is known as the “Barton–Nackman trick.” This blog post showed one way in which
the Barton–Nackman trick, specifically, provides a subtle benefit.</p>

<p>Even in C++20, STL containers generally use free templates instead of the Barton–Nackman trick,
which means that <code>sort_in_place</code> will, for example, <em>work</em> when <code>vt</code> is <code>vector&lt;int&gt;</code>
but <em>fail</em> when <code>vt</code> is <code>vector&lt;string&gt;</code>. (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/x7nWhj">Godbolt.</a>)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Continuing my search for a better debugging experience for my current projects (zig/c, nixos). </p>
<p>The <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger/">first post</a> resulted in a ton of suggestions and I tried them all.</p>
<h2 id="gdb-tui-again">gdb -tui (again)</h2>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25407161">taviso explained</a> how to use the tui properly. </p>
<p>C-l fixes the display and using <code>gdb -tty $SOME_OTHER_TTY</code> stops it from getting messed up in the first place.</p>
<p>Readline bindings (C-n, C-p etc) work in the command window even while the source window has focus. <code>focus cmd</code> gives focus to the command window so I can use arrow keys again.</p>
<p>C-x A is supposed to toggle the tui but for me just crashes, in both alacritty and xterm. I've <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/106868">reported this against nix</a> for now, since that's the most likely culprit. (EDIT nope, <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/106981">it was a gdb bug</a>).</p>
<h2 id="emacs-gdb">emacs gdb</h2>
<p>Many people suggested using <code>gdb</code> and <code>gdb-many-windows</code> instead of <code>gud</code>. </p>
<p>This is much better - I get a clickable thread list, backtrace and locals list.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/emacs.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It displays all my locals as "&lt;complex data type&gt;" which is not super helpful. There is a <a href="https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=34589">patch</a> to improve this but it looks like it got delayed by legal issues.</p>
<h2 id="emacs-dap-mode">emacs dap-mode</h2>
<p>For gdb this <a href="https://emacs-lsp.github.io/dap-mode/page/configuration/#native-debug-gdblldb">requires</a> the vscode extension which I couldn't get working in the last post, so I haven't investigated further.</p>
<h2 id="clion-again">clion (again)</h2>
<p>Kaylee Blake emailed me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Several of the issues you encountered with CLion are ones I have previously encountered, and thankfully two of them are solvable and one can be worked around. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your variables are (probably) not being displayed because CLion leans on its language support for computing precise start-of-scope for variables (GDB doesn't support this DWARF feature, sadly), but unfortunately defaults to assuming that variables are always out of scope if its language support isn't capable of mapping debug symbols to declarations. (It appears that the Zig plugin doesn't have any debugger integration). As such, you need to click on the gear icon on the left of the debug pane (in your screenshot, hidden behind a <code>&gt;&gt;</code> symbol at the bottom), and uncheck "Hide out-of-scope variables".</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To use the Memory View, you need to right-click on any variable and choose "Show in Memory View", which will actually cause the pane to load. I have no idea why this is required given that the Memory View is perfectly capable of navigating to raw addresses or addresses computed by arbitrary expressions once the pane has loaded.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You (probably) can't set breakpoints through the UI because the Zig plugin doesn't register the Zig filetype as capable of having breakpoints set on it. There's no way to fix this without writing a plugin, unfortunately, but you can still use the GDB console to set breakpoints. They won't persist between sessions, though, or show up in the UI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of the fixes worked. I can now see variables and open them in the memory view.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/clion.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The memory view doesn't support editing memory, but I can still do that in the gdb console.</p>
<p>I added <code>*actual.items.ptr@100</code> to the watches list and it rendered the whole array perfectly happily.</p>
<p>Setting breakpoints in the gdb console seemed to work at first, but restarting the program to get to the breakpoint doesn't. If I rerun using the button in the debugger, the breakpoints disappear. If I try to restart the program from within gdb, it crashes:</p>
<pre><code><span>(gdb) info breakpoints
No breakpoints or watchpoints.
(gdb) b Tree.searchForwards
Breakpoint 1 at 0x207222: file /home/jamie/focus/lib/focus/tree.zig, line 591.
(gdb) run
Command 'run' is not supported.
(gdb) start
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) [answered Y; input not from terminal]
Temporary breakpoint 2 at 0x2097dc: file /nix/store/5g4w66g606d46w8pmzwzq7flrlk3k7cs-zig/lib/zig/std/start.zig, line 243.
Starting program: /home/jamie/focus/test 1&gt; '/dev/pts/4' 2&gt; '/dev/pts/5' 
During startup program exited with code 1.
</span></code></pre>
<p>I can get this to work by starting the program, immediately pausing, setting a breakpoint and then resuming. </p>
<p>Holding F8 to continue runs smoothly, like most of the other debuggers. But unlike most of the other debuggers the local variables stop being displayed until I release the key, so I can't just watch the changes in real time.</p>
<h2 id="netbeans">netbeans</h2>
<p>I made a new C++ project with the wizard and hit "Debug Main Project". At first I though nothing happened, but after a while I noticed a small red message box at the bottom-right of the screen.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/netbeans_0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It's actually bigger when it first appears, but it shrinks after a few seconds of not being noticed.</p>
<p>Anyway:</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/netbeans_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It says it can't write to /tmp.</p>
<pre><code><span>jamie@machine:~/nixpkgs$ cat &gt; /tmp/test
foo
jamie@machine:~/nixpkgs$ cat /tmp/test
foo
</span></code></pre>
<p>I can write to /tmp.</p>
<p>It also says I should do something like <code>netbeans -J-Dcnd.tmpbase="/home/jamie/netbeans-project"</code>. But that produces the same error message, still referring to "/tmp" rather than the directory I gave it. Did I spell something wrong?</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<pre><code><span>[nix-shell:~]$ strace netbeans 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep 'tmp'

[nix-shell:~]$
</span></code></pre>
<p>It doesn't actually seem to be trying to write "/tmp". It actually doesn't issue any syscalls at all when I press "Debug Main Project" and trigger the message. So I think it's just misreporting some other error. The underlying issue is probably nix-related again.</p>
<p>Also... I try to avoid ranting about software, because software is hard. But if you give me an error message and then make the error text non-selectable and then in the context menu only offer "Mark As Read" instead of "Copy To Clipboard So I Can Google This" then it makes debugging a lot slower.</p>
<h2 id="cgdb">cgdb</h2>
<p>Broadly similar to gdb -tui. It shows the source window and has a lot of useful keyboard shortcuts, but it doesn't display much ambient information like current backtrace or local variables. Everything seems to work, but it's not what I'm looking for.</p>
<h2 id="kdevelop">kdevelop</h2>
<pre><code><span>[nix-shell:~]$ kdevelop --version
kdevelop 5.5.2
</span></code></pre>
<p>Running, breaking, setting watchpoints and navigating the backtrace all worked smoothly.</p>
<p>There doesn't seem to be a memory view or a way to display arbitrary expressions. I tried adding <code>display (*actual.items.ptr)@100</code> in the gdb console and it didn't appear anywhere on screen, nor did it print the result in the console after the first time.</p>
<p>The rendering of large arrays is a bit annoying - you have to click at the beginning to reveal a few more elements, but they appear at the end. So getting the whole thing on screen requires lots of scrolling.</p>
<p>The key binding for 'next' is also in use by kate, so you have to go into the bindings menu and disambiguate. Which wouldn't be a big deal except that it reset several times over the course of a single session so I had to keep visiting the bindings menu.</p>
<h2 id="gdb-dashboard">gdb-dashboard</h2>
<p>An init file for gdb that adds a dashboard, which is printed whenever the program stops and can be hooked to print at other times too.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/gdb-dashboard.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This is pretty great. It doesn't offer the easy point-and-click of a gui but it does reliably put a bunch of useful context on the screen. And it manages to do that without breaking or hiding basic features of gdb like most of the gui frontends I tried. </p>
<p>I'm still on the lookout for a good gui debugger, but this is what I'll use in the meantime.</p>
<h2 id="voltron">voltron</h2>
<p>Loris Cro suggested voltron which is similar to gdb-dashboard but opens the various view in separate terminals and updates them in real time. This seems like a strict improvement and I really like the idea.</p>
<p>After wading through the usual python dependency management morass, I managed to occasionally run some voltron views but mostly managed to crash it repeatedly, and occasionally gdb too. </p>
<p>(The gdb crashes are in <a href="https://paste.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/ad867039557cc4c6f5ffe22e4f14a0f13fa78c86">somewhere inside printf</a> so this might be the same issue as the tui crash above.) </p>
<h2 id="gdb-frontend">gdb-frontend</h2>
<p>Ilmari Lauhakangas suggested the somewhat generically named gdb-frontend. </p>
<p>If I type the full path in the file picker it pops up "An error has occurred". You have to type the dirname and then pick the file from the list.</p>
<p>When I ran the program it reached the breakpoint and then the UI stopped responding to button clicks and occasionally spat out messages saying the gdb main thread was blocking.</p>
<p>After C-c in terminal it left behind a bunch of ophan gdb processes that prevented gdbfrontend from being restarted.</p>
<h3 id="ddd-again">ddd (again)</h3>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25410215">drosan explained</a> that in ddd the focus follows the mouse which explains why I had trouble typing in the text boxes.</p>
<p>The other bugs I experienced are still blockers though.</p>

<p>Other tools that came up in the conversation:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hugsy/gef">gef</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg">pwndbg</a> add a bunch of commands to gdb that are useful for low-level debugging and reverse engineering. 
<a href="https://github.com/radareorg/radare2">radare2</a> is an independent set of tools for the same purpose that can optionally connect to gdb. I don't have much use for these at the moment, but it's good to know about them.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeclap.itch.io/codeclap">codeclap</a> looks interesting but is still in alpha and doesn't have a demo.</p>
<p><a href="https://pernos.co/">pernosco</a> is a project I've been keeping an eye on. It's not currently affordable for hobby stuff, but I can certainly imagine paying for it when I start doing commercial work again.</p>
<p><a href="https://frida.re/">frida</a> injects javascript code into binaries. At the very least, this enables post-hoc println debugging. I've put aside a weekend in my calendar to try it out.</p>
<p><a href="https://justine.storage.googleapis.com/blinkenlights/index.html">blinkenlights</a> I think is a way to watch your code execute as directly as possible, so you can build intuition for what is actually happening on the hardware. I tried it out quickly and it rendered a single frame before exiting with code 0. But it's interesting enough that I made a note to come back and try it again next year.</p>
<p>I haven't tried many proprietary options so far. While I have a strong preference for foss tools, I'm open to suggestions for good proprietary tools so long as I can try them out without emailing a sales team for a quote.</p>

						<p>Taking a photo of a snowflake doesn't sound too difficult. That is until you actually set off to get these quick-melting wonders of nature to stay frozen for your sensitive high resolution equipment. To capture the beauty of its minutae, photographer Nathan Myhrvold travelled to Fairbanks, Alaska, and Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada.</p><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/Nathan-Myhrvold-Portrait.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Nathan-Myhrvold-Portrait.jpg 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Nathan-Myhrvold-Portrait.jpg 1000w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Nathan-Myhrvold-Portrait.jpg 1600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/Nathan-Myhrvold-Portrait.jpg 1667w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Nathan Myhrvold / Modernist Cuisine Gallery, LLC</figcaption></figure><p>Myhrvold's strongest snowflakes were found at temperatures between-15 and-20 °F (-26 to-29 °C). It is difficult to capture the picture of a snowflake because of their scale and vulnerability.</p><p>The photographer, chef, scientist and author Nathan Myhrvold is a former Microsoft technology leader. He draws on his physicist training to push photographic boundaries. Using his passions for food, research, and creativity, he and his team are developing custom cameras, robots, microscopes and software for the development of unique photographic perspectives.</p><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/No-Two-Alike.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/No-Two-Alike.jpg 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/No-Two-Alike.jpg 958w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>"No Two Alike" Nathan Myhrvold / Modernist Cuisine Gallery, LLC</figcaption></figure><p>Snow crystals are only a few millimeters long. Snowflakes are grouped according to shape. Sector plates, stellar dendrites, and fernlike stellar dendrites are on full display in the crystals in these photos. They melt and sublimate, which over time degrades the sharp characteristics of the crystal structure. Time, temperature, weather and equipment, for a photographer, make snowflakes such a delicate subject.</p><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/Yellowknife-Flurry.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Yellowknife-Flurry.jpg 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/Yellowknife-Flurry.jpg 958w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>"Ice Queen" Nathan Myhrvold / Modernist Cuisine Gallery, LLC</figcaption></figure><p>Myhrvold spent about 18 months designing and building a custom snowflake camera.

<p>As far as I can remember, I’ve always had a disdain towards Apple products. Something about buying a laptop with poor thermals, a restrictive operating system, and a $1400 price tag just didn’t sit right with me. I was more content using my beat-up Thinkpad with Linux installed. </p>



<p>But 2020 has been an interesting year. So it would be fitting that 2020 would be the first year that I would venture out to buy a new laptop and somehow settle on choosing the new M1 Macbook Air. After using it for the past few weeks, I could not be happier. However, this got me thinking. How did Apple convince me (a staunch critic of Apple products) to buy a Mac?</p>



<p>After retracing my steps, I realized it was primarily due to their copywriting. As an engineer, I’ve only recently started to realize how important copywriting is when selling anything. Apple’s recent campaign around the new M1 Macs has been nothing short of spectacular and as engineers, I feel like there 2 key takeaways we all can learn from them. </p>



<h2>Talk About Impact And Not Numbers</h2>



<p>Two years ago I had just started my own startup that was highly technical. We were building computer vision algorithms to empower minimally trained medical professionals to do oral disease screenings. Our team was filled with engineers who were always striving to grow our accuracy so we could improve the value of our product. </p>



<p>This mentality carried over to our marketing materials, from our website to our sales deck. We had an accuracy of 85% which was about 15% more effective than the current incumbent, and we let everybody know. The number 85 was plastered over everything and we were proud of it. We even showed people how great our F1 Score was in relation to other medical AI companies. Our marketing was heavy on the numbers which we felt accurately demonstrated our product’s value. </p>



<p>However, it never really resonated with customers. Most doctors we were pitching to didn’t even know what an F1 score was. To see how to do numbers correctly we should look at the following marketing material:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/themes/veen/assets/images/transparent.gif" data-lazy="true" data-src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020.jpg" alt="" width="533" height="300" data-srcset="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020.jpg 1000w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020-300x169.jpg 300w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020-768x432.jpg 768w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020-100x56.jpg 100w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020-700x394.jpg 700w" data-sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px"></figure></div>



<p>Apple showed this graph at a recent event but notice how there are only 2 numbers on the screen. Even the graph has no clearly visible indicators on the y and x-axis (you really have to pay attention to what each axis represents). Instead, it shows the improvement in relation to other chips without blasting the crowd with a series of numbers. Now, this is how Apple communicates this improvement on their website when focusing on potential customers:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/themes/veen/assets/images/transparent.gif" data-lazy="true" data-src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1024x774.png" alt="Battery Copy Example" width="430" height="324" data-srcset="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1024x774.png 1024w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-300x227.png 300w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-768x581.png 768w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1536x1161.png 1536w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-100x76.png 100w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-595x450.png 595w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1588x1200.png 1588w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1.png 1868w" data-sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"></figure></div>



<p>Now the Apple marketing team could have used this space to go into the specifics about the power draw of this new M1 chip and how it’s better than the old Intel chips. In fact, this move was wildly criticized by technical reviewers. Most notably Linus Tech Tips said that Apple’s unwillingness to release these specific numbers could be their downfall on this new Mac (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljApzn9YWmk">video link</a>). Yet this Mac has had a great reception and great sales. </p>



<p>So why did this marketing move work? Because Apple focused on how this better power consumption was going to solve the deeper emotional problems of their consumers. In one swift sentence, they were able to communicate 3 very key points. </p>



<p>With “Up to 18 hours of battery life. That’s 6 more hours, free of charge”, the Apple marketing team is able to show how this better battery consumption will increase the overall time you (as the consumer) have during a single charge but also clearly draws the competitive advantage by saying that is 6 hours more than their previous models/competitors. Finally, ending with “free of charge” lets us know that we aren’t going to paying more for this increased efficiency. It’s a powerful sentence that clearly conveys a technical topic like the M1 chip’s power consumption into something more digestible to your everyday consumer. </p>



<p>We see this work again in the following:</p>

<p>This new Mac has great thermals to the point where there is no fan in the Macbook air. However, even without a fan, there is no tradeoff with performance. Again, the Apple team could have used this time to speak about how hot the Macbook actually gets. They could have pulled an MKBHD and used a temperature gun to compare the temperature under different workloads and put this video on their site. Instead, they recognized the real problem is that most people hate the sound of their laptop’s fan cranking away while they are trying to get work done. So rather than getting into the weeds, Apple decided to step back and focus on what pain point they are solving. </p>



<p>How I’ve decided to apply this was taking a step back and every time I saw that we were using too many numbers, I thought critically about what issue we were solving with that number and replaced it with that. </p>



<p>For example, why did health systems care about our device having 85% accuracy? With higher accuracy, doctors were able to refer their patients with more confidence and improve health outcomes. We quickly changed our copywriting to reflect this sentiment. </p>



<h2>Talk Like A Human</h2>



<p>This is something that took me a long time to get past. After going through university, most of my writing became extremely formal. But the truth is no one speaks like that. However, when writing marketing materials, I feel like most engineers default to writing like they are trying to pass a university final rather than talk to a customer. </p>



<p>When you scroll down Apple’s website, it seems like someone is speaking to you. For example: </p>

<p>Now this is actually a pretty technical point that Apple is trying to get across. However, they are speaking to us, the consumer, in a super casual tone. They start out with a pretty number centric pitch. However, they quickly pivot to speaking about how this extra speed will help you with your day to day activities. During this part of the pitch, they sound like a normal person. </p>



<p>The light gray paragraph is filled with shortened words (like pro vs. professional) and run-on sentences. They use casual language like “That’s” and casual terminology like “brain power”. If I wrote like this while doing my undergrad ethics class I’m sure I wouldn’t have passed. However, when you see any company writing like this it humanizes them. </p>



<p>This gave me flashbacks to 2 related moments during my freshman year during school. The first moment came when I was walking into my engineering library and saw a desk set up in the entryway. Two students stood in front of it hawking a new app that lets you get discounts on food within Green Street (the most popular street at UIUC). Since they were near the staircase, I had to listen briefly to their spiel before grabbing a brochure and leaving. I never downloaded that app and it soon went under so I’m assuming most people also didn’t download the app. The second moment came my junior year where during a party, a friend of a friend mentioned how he was using this brand new app on campus which let him see food deals. I had built up enough rapport with this stranger where I thought it would be worth checking out this app so I downloaded it that night. I later came to find out that guy was a campus ambassador for that app and it was his job to get students on the app. Even after finding that out, I still kept the app. </p>



<p>So why did I download the app the second time and not the first? Because the first time, I was in a situation where I felt like I was being sold something. Those campus ambassadors had a script and they stuck to it. The second time, I wasn’t actually being sold anything but rather listening to a guy talk about his experience on the app. The difference was very noticeable. In the first case, they were rattling off numbers about how much money I could save while in the second case, the ambassador told me stories about how he got 30 chicken nuggets for 6 dollars or how he was able to get a free meal for his date after finding a buy 1 get 1 free offer at a local burrito joint. </p>



<p>This can be applied to copywriting. The difference between bad and good copywriting is the ability to make it not sound like a sales pitch. If people feel like they are trying to be sold something, they are more likely to put up a wall and not buy anything. As an engineer, I try to write about what I’m working on like I’m telling my friend about it. That way it’s always more personable. Remember, people don’t like being sold to. </p>

<p>Apple does a great job of technical copywriting. Their teams are great at taking complex technical advantages and condensing them down into something more understandable. I think we can all learn from them and apply some of their methods to our own side projects. As the saying goes – <em>“Good artists make, great artists steal”</em></p>

      <h2>Results and their interpretation for the First Kakoune Community Survey</h2>

<p>You’ll find below the results to the (now closed)
<a href="https://s.surveyplanet.com/hYB1V90ul">First Kakoune Community Survey</a>,
as well as general <a href="#takeaways">takeaways</a> derived from them. An interpretation
of the data is also provided when relevant. All the specific questions
(e.g. the multiple-choice ones) that were asked had for objective to shed some
light on a specific point, interpreting the replies is a useful indicator of
whether the contributors to the <a href="https://kakoune.org/">Kakoune editor</a> are
headed in the right direction, are aware of the biggest problems the users
face, and have an accurate vision of how the tool is being used in the wild.</p>

<p>Note that the raw free-writing type answers will not be attached to this post,
as I cannot extract them easily out of the survey platform used for polling.
I also wouldn’t like users to hesitate to be open about their opinions of
the editor in future polls, out of fear that their words might end up being
published (albeit without any identifying information attached to them).</p>

<p>Thanks to the 151 respondents who have donated their precious time to take
the survey!</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: There are only a couple of such questions in the poll, but the
percentages in some doughnut graphs are not accurate! The survey platform
fooled me into thinking the number associated with a frequency would be an
index, to facilitate statistical analysis via programming. Those turned out
to be weights for rating computation (second column named
“Rating” on the pictures). Changing the values after the fact in the
survey platform’s interface resulted into the data being corrupted and
unusable, so read the <em>Adjusted data</em> when I provided them, they’re the
real numbers.</p>

<h2 id="the-questions">The questions</h2>

<h3 id="q1-how-did-you-learn-about-kakoune">Q1: How did you learn about Kakoune?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_1-how_did_you_learn_about_kakoune.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_1-how_did_you_learn_about_kakoune.png" alt="Question 1">
</a></p>

<p>Social information sharing platforms are the crossroad that directs users
towards Kakoune, by far.</p>

<p>Hits from the “internet highway” (search engines) have a low conversion
rate in comparison, which could indicate that some SEO work needs to be
done on the main site.</p>

<p>Despite being as big as personal recommendations and web searches, the
“other” category only presents separate, unrelated, anecdotal data points.</p>

<h3 id="q2-have-you-ever-personally-recommended-kakoune-to-a-anybody-in-person-or-online">Q2: Have you ever personally recommended Kakoune to a anybody, in person or online?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_2-have_you_ever_personally_recommended_kakoune_to_anybody_in_person_or_online.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_2-have_you_ever_personally_recommended_kakoune_to_anybody_in_person_or_online.png" alt="Question 2">
</a></p>

<p>Two-thirds of users report having personally recommended the editor to
somebody else. It shows that the tool has a significant enough impact on its
users that most of them would get out of their way to recommend it to others.</p>

<p>However, when stacking these replies with those to the previous question,
we can see that a low percentage of those recommendations have resulted in
a user adopting Kakoune.</p>

<h3 id="q3-how-often-do-you-use-the-editor">Q3: How often do you use the editor?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_3-how_often_do_you_use_the_editor.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_3-how_often_do_you_use_the_editor.png" alt="Question 3">
</a></p>

<p>Adjusted data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>daily: 56%</li>
  <li>rarely: 29%</li>
  <li>weekly: 10%</li>
  <li>monthly: 3%</li>
</ul>

<p>Being branded as a code editor, it’s not surprising that most users report
using Kakoune daily.</p>

<p>Close to one third of users report using it “rarely”, which is an
unexpected outcome. The silver lining could be that those users still find
a corner-case use to the editor on occasion, which apparently cannot be
better fulfilled with any other tools. I’ll take 45 “rarely”s over
45 “never”s!</p>

<h3 id="q4-how-long-have-you-used-kakoune-regardless-of-frequency-of-use">Q4: How long have you used Kakoune, regardless of frequency of use?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_4-how_long_have_you_used_kakoune.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_4-how_long_have_you_used_kakoune.png" alt="Question 4">
</a></p>

<p>Adjusted data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>less than a year: 60%</li>
  <li>a few years (1-3): 32%</li>
  <li>a long time (more than 3 years): 6%</li>
</ul>

<p>A reasonable amount of users have stuck around over the years. Future
surveys will tell us more about the tool’s retention rate, but I’m confident
considering the increasing frequency of discussions in the community (forums,
IRC, reddit etc.).</p>

<h3 id="q5-do-you-use-kakoune-for-work-if-yes-what-do-you-mainly-use-it-for">Q5: Do you use Kakoune for work? If yes, what do you mainly use it for?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_5-do_you_use_kakoune_for_work.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_5-do_you_use_kakoune_for_work.png" alt="Question 5">
</a></p>

<p>Out of 142 respondents, 3 explicitly stated they do not use the editor for
work (in “other”), and 9 did not reply since the question is predicated
on whether the respondent does use Kakoune for work. 92% of users trust
the editor to help them fulfill their job duties. That’s a badge of
honour in itself considering the focus other bigger editors/IDEs (Integrated
Development Environment) place on a self-awarded stamp of work-friendliness,
and the total absence of it in Kakoune.</p>

<p>Another nice surprise is that 5% of respondents who use Kakoune for work
mostly write generic prose with the editor, showing that the editor is a
versatile tool that doesn’t only appeal to programmers.</p>

<h3 id="q6-what-statements-best-describe-how-you-use-kakoune">Q6: What statements best describe how you use Kakoune?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_6-what_statements_best_describe_how_you_use_kakoune.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_6-what_statements_best_describe_how_you_use_kakoune.png" alt="Question 6">
</a></p>

<p>The results are in line with the answers to the previous question. The
resolution of the way users interact with the tool is increased here, as
almost 20% of users have selected two or more statements (different than
“other” or reiterated in the “other” form that they use Kakoune as
a specialised tool, option 2). This reveals that the editor is in fact no
just a uni-dimensional tool, but a convenient utility suitable in separate
situations.</p>

<h3 id="q7-what-is-your-job-title">Q7: What is your job title?</h3>

<p>As a way to compliment the answers to the previous questions (<em>how</em> the tool
is being used), respondents indicated in <em>what</em> capacity they interacted
with Kakoune.</p>

<p>Here are the fields the respondents work in:</p>

<p>Software Engineering: 79%
Student: 7%
Science related fields (data science, mathematics, research…): 5%
Unemployed: 2%</p>

<p>Note that one respondent works as a Musician, and another does programming
as a hobby, proving once again the versatility of the tool.</p>

<h3 id="q8-what-systems-do-you-use-kakoune-on">Q8: What system(s) do you use Kakoune on?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_8-what_systems_do_you_use_kakoune_on.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_8-what_systems_do_you_use_kakoune_on.png" alt="Question 8">
</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>139 respondents use Linux (the poll shows 138, but one respondent used the
<code>other</code> field to specify <code>GNU/Linux</code>)</li>
  <li>of those, 50 use the editor on another system, along with Linux; 35 out
of those 50 respondents use Mac</li>
  <li>99 respondents use the editor on only one system: 89 exclusively use Linux, 8 Mac</li>
  <li>out of the 7 respondents who mentioned using Windows, only one uses it
exclusively, all other respondents declared using it along with Linux</li>
</ul>

<p>The above data helps figure out which systems should be prioritised in terms
of support: most users only use Linux, and roughly half as many exclusively
use Mac.</p>

<p>However, the numbers also reveal that many use Kakoune on several systems
at once, fortunately the most popular combination is comprised of Linux
and Mac, so the previous data point did not hide anything.</p>

<p>A statistically relevant amount of users (&lt;10% in all), albeit comparatively
small compared to the core of Linux/Mac users, uses BSD, Windows, WSL,
Illumos, NixOS. Future surveys will reveal if these populations are growing,
and if support for those platforms should be watched more carefully (even
though any user reporting an issue on any platform they’re using will get
help if possible).</p>

<h3 id="q9-is-kakoune-your-main-code-editor-if-yes-what-other-editor-were-you-mainly-using-before-switching-over-to-kakoune-if-not-what-is-preventing-you-from-switching-over-to-kakoune">Q9: Is Kakoune your main code editor? If yes, what other editor were you mainly using before switching over to Kakoune? If not, what is preventing you from switching over to Kakoune?</h3>

<p>After reading all the replies and taking count, I found that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>75 respondents use Kakoune as their main editor, and stated switching
over from the following editors (5 have not documented that information):</p>

    <ul>
      <li>35 Vim</li>
      <li>18 NeoVim</li>
      <li>9 Emacs</li>
      <li>6 VScode</li>
      <li>2 Vis</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>68 respondents do not use Kakoune as their main editor, and 42 among them
have kindly stated what editor they use instead:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>23 Vim</li>
      <li>6 NeoVim</li>
      <li>5 Emacs</li>
      <li>5 VScode</li>
      <li>2 Sublime Text</li>
      <li>1 RStudio</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The most common reasons that held respondents back from switching over were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no time or motivation to learn</li>
  <li>difficult to add support for custom languages</li>
  <li>some plugins were not implemented for Kakoune</li>
  <li>too tedious to migrate the user configuration</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_10-do_you_use_third_party_plugins_written_by_the_community.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_10-do_you_use_third_party_plugins_written_by_the_community.png" alt="Question 10">
</a></p>

<p>Two third of respondents do use plugins written by members of the community,
which hints us that there is an ecosystem that delivers useful extensions
to the editor.</p>

<h3 id="q11-do-you-write-custom-kakoune-scripts">Q11: Do you write custom Kakoune scripts?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_11-do_you_write_custom_kakoune_script.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_11-do_you_write_custom_kakoune_script.png" alt="Question 11">
</a></p>

<p>Most users don’t need to write their own plugins, which could mean that
those already available cover the most common needs among the community,
or that they simply don’t need to extend the editor with plugins (it already
“just works”).</p>

<p>I could also be that most users don’t care to implement the features they’re
lacking, and just stick around until somebody else does.</p>

<h3 id="q12-do-you-publish-those-scripts-online-on-github-gitlab-etc">Q12: Do you publish those scripts online (on Github, Gitlab etc.)?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_12-do_you_publish_those_scripts_online.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_12-do_you_publish_those_scripts_online.png" alt="Question 12">
</a></p>

<p>According to the data from question #11, roughly half of respondents
that write plugins publish them online to be used by the community.</p>

<p>This could mean that the average plugin is so small that it’s not seen as
worthy of being published.</p>

<h3 id="q13-what-plugins-do-not-exist-yet-that-you-wish-were-available">Q13: What plugins do not exist yet that you wish were available?</h3>

<p>The replies to this question are quite spread out, with most suggestions
being mentioned only by a single respondent. Here are the ones that appeared
six times, making up the most mentioned suggestions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>support for <a href="https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter">tree-sitter</a></li>
  <li>better support for the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language Server Protocol</a></li>
  <li>an advanced Git wrapper, similar to <a href="https://github.com/magit/magit">Magit</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">Fugitive</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The following suggestions were all suggested 3 times each, and follow the
above in the list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a diff viewer, similar to <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/diff.html">VimDiff</a></li>
  <li>support for the <a href="https://orgmode.org/">OrgMode</a> format</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues/453">code folding</a> support</li>
  <li>better support for fuzzy-matching, similar to
<a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a>; one respondent mentioned the ability
not to have to use a multiplexer to open a file found via the utility</li>
</ul>

<p>Among the anecdotal suggestions, here’s a list of those I find interesting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a browsable undo tree</li>
  <li>a scroll bar</li>
  <li>a set of commands to interact with Git hunks (select, revert etc.)</li>
  <li>a wrapper of <code>:make</code> that handles more error formats</li>
  <li>a merge tool for Mercurial</li>
  <li>an integrated Python debugger</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that some suggestions (not given here) were not entirely relevant,
as they were more of a bug report, feature request of generic remark that
were not related to plugins.</p>

<p>This is useful information, as it helps directing the efforts of contributors
who would want to implement a plugin, backed with data.</p>

<h3 id="q14-in-what-languages-do-you-read-software-documentation-in-on-your-system">Q14: In what language(s) do you read software documentation in, on your system?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_14-in_what_languages_do_you_read_software_documentation_in_on_your_system.png">

</a></p>

<p>The editor assumes that most of its users are comfortable reading its
documentation and user interface in English, which is comforted by the
data above.</p>

IHP gives you a convenient way of writing forms with server-side validation.</li><li>Use Elm for the <strong>advanced UI stuff</strong> requiring heavy use of DOM manipulation. Elm shines in writing user interfaces with high complexity.

          <h2>How to speed up long-distance HTTP file downloads by 6x</h2>
	  <p><small>10-12-2020</small></p>
          <hr>
          <p>The vast majority of HTTP communications use the TCP protocol to transfer data. TCP connections deliver data in-order and without message loss through the use of retransmits and message buffers. Since buffers need to store all sent messages before they are acknowledged, the maximum achievable throughput of a TCP connection is calculatable by a function of buffer size and latency. In long distance communications, this maximum throughput is often lower than the line speed, slowing down the connection on a line that could support faster communications. In this article we explore what impact these buffers have on TCP connection throughput in Linux for HTTP file downloads, demonstrating performance improvements of up to 6x over Ubuntu defaults on a connection with a 200ms ping.</p>

<pre><code>sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=2147483647
sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=2147483647
sysctl -w net.core.optmem_max=50331648
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_mem="2097152 2097152 2097152"
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_rmem="1024000 8738000 2147483647"
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_wmem="1024000 8738000 2147483647"</code></pre>
<p>Running the above script on both the client and server will increase download throughput on long distance at the cost of increased memory usage (up to 8GB of memory allocated across all TCP streams) on both the server and client.</p>


<p>The TCP protocol guarentees lossless in-order communication through the use of receive and transmit buffers, memory dedicated to holding the contents of messages which have not finished processing yet. The receive buffers store fragments of messages received out of order until all preceeding data is accounted for, while transmit buffers store messages that have been sent but are not yet acknowledged, in case they need to be retransmitted. Typically these buffers are allocated a finite amount of memory per-stream by an operating system, and exhaustion of these buffers leads to stalled connections and overall lower throughput.</p>
<p>Latency, the time it takes for a message transmitted to be received, is particularly good at triggering the exhaustion of TCP connection buffers. Every message sent by a TCP connection must be acknowledged by the receiving side before it can be removed from the sender's transmit buffer, which means that even in ideal conditions a single round trip must take place before a slot in the transmit buffer can be freed. If the buffer is exhausted then the sender will stall, since no new messages can be added to the transmit buffer. As such, when sending lots of data long-distance, the maximum achievable throughput is:</p>
<pre><code>buffer size in bytes * (1 / latency in seconds)</code></pre>
<p>This bottleneck, plus the fairly opaque relationship between buffer size, latency, and overall connection throughput, can often make users believe that their internet connection is slow, when really they have just failed to allocate enough memory to take full advantage of the bandwidth they have available.</p>
<p>NOTE: Arrangement of TCP windows is a component of the TCP protocol we will gloss over today. TCP connections communicate their buffer sizes as windows, so that the other end of a connection does not overwhelm them with too much data. On Linux, the window size communicated is decided by the memory allowed to be allocated to a single TCP connection.</p>


<p>In this experiment we demonstrate the impact that TCP buffer sizes have on long-distance TCP connection throughput by configuring buffer sizes on a Linux (Ubuntu) server and client. To do this we download a randomly generated file over a server hosted in Germany from a client in Hong Kong (~200ms ping). Linux allows users to change the minimum, maximum, and default amount of memory allocated to each TCP stream. Most distributions set low limits by default in order to preserve system resources. In our experiment we show that the impact of increasing these values on both the client and server can be quite dramatic, demonstrating up to a 6x increase in HTTP download speed.</p>

<h2>Low Defaults</h2>
<p>This work was motivated after observing that the Debian and Ubuntu default buffer sizes seemed to be set too low. At time of writing the TCP sysctl settings on my Regolith Linux (Ubuntu derived distribution) were set to:</p>
<pre><code>net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 131072 6291456
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 16384 4194304</code></pre>
<p>In simple terms, this allows for a 6MB receive buffer and a 4MB send buffer. Thus, by the formula above our total achievable throughput is:</p>
<pre><code>600000 * (1/0.2) = ~3MB/s = ~50Mbps</code></pre>
<p>This total achievable throughput is a far cry from the potential of our gigabit network, which should enable transfers at nearly 125MB/s.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>We configure two Linux machines (Ubuntu Server), one acting as a client and one acting as a webserver. The server machine has the maximum buffer sizes enabled and a large file to download hosted via NGINX. Both our client and server have 1Gbps internet links, with the client located in Hong Kong and the server in Germany.</p>
<p>For each buffer size we set the client's transmit and receive TCP buffer limit and default to the specified size, but we do not change other TCP settings. For these tests we use the default TCP congestion profile on Ubuntu (cubic) and have default settings for TCP slow start.</p>
<p>To test bandwidth we set the large file downloading with a time limit of ten minutes. As the file downloads we the average throughput. To automate this test we use the following scripts:</p>
<pre><code># run_tests
while read p; do
  echo "# Starting test with $p"
  ./configure_settings "${p}"

  echo "# Sleeping"
  sleep 240

  echo "# Going"
  timeout 10m curl http://dev.parsed.uk/file.data --output /dev/null

done &lt; test.txt </code></pre>
<p>This script sequentially executes the same test with different test configurations loaded from test.txt.</p>

<pre><code># prepare for test
sysctl -w net.core.wmem_default=2147483647
sysctl -w net.core.rmem_default=2147483647
sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=2147483647
sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=2147483647
sysctl -w net.core.optmem_max=50331648
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_mem="2097152 2097152 2097152"
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_rmem="$1"
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_wmem="$1"
sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1</code></pre>
<p>This script sets the TCP parameters for the test. The scripts are available on Github <a href="https://github.com/jawline/tcp-test-configuration">here</a>. We allowed a four minute period between setting sysctl settings and beginning the test to allow for the TCP settings to properly apply.</p>

<h2>Results &amp; Conclusions</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.parsed.uk/images/tcp_graph_original.png"></p>
<p>From our results we see that the TCP buffer sizes have a significant impact on throughput long distance. The maximum throughput observed during testing (21MB/s) was over 6x faster than the throughput for the client with a default configuration (~3-4MB/s). We observe that increases in buffer size correlate with increased in throughput until we reach 64MB TCP buffers. In our tests we see throughput peak at 21MB/s, and see no further gain in increasing buffer sizes beyond this. This is likely a limitation of one of the two servers, or the network that links them together. If our testing was not limited by other factors, we should observe further increases in performance was we increase TCP buffer sizes beyond that. Additionally, note that our testing is not rigerous, we performed a single test at each TCP memory increments and do not control for external factors such as network fluctuations or peak time load at the datacenter. Regardless, the limited testing methodology is still sufficient to show the clear trend of increasing throughput with TCP buffer sizes.</p>
<p>While unbounding the maximum buffer sizes is probably not ideal for most configurations, we suggest increasing buffer sizes to allow for 64-128MB per TCP stream on systems where the memory is available.</p>

<p>BitChute has banned the Nordic Resistance Movement’s <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/channel/nmr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official channel</a>, the NRM radio channel and has deleted a large number of videos uploaded by other users featuring the Resistance Movement in what appears to be a mass wave of censorship.</p>
<p>The “free speech” video site replaced the Nordic Resistance Movement’s account with the following message on Thursday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Your channel has been blocked for breaching the BitChute Community Guidelines.</p>
<p>An email was sent to your registered email address detailing the reasoning behind this decision.</p>
<p>If you have not received it, or wish to appeal against the decision, then please&nbsp;contact us.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, despite this claim, no emails have been received to our registered email address from BitChute. In addition, no warnings or notifications about our videos were received by the Resistance Movement from BitChute prior to the ban.</p>
<p>This is not the first instance of BitChute censoring legitimate content on its site. Recently, BitChute blocked a number of popular channels in various countries, forcing users to use a VPN in order to view them. The censorship followed BitChute’s <a href="https://support.bitchute.com/announcements/response-to-hope-not-hate-report-on-bitchute" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> in July in which they “encouraged organizations like Hope Not Hate” (a UK-based “anti-racist” organisation) to “help them improve their processes”.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, the humble ASX is actually pretty damn big – as of December 4th, it has a market cap of $2,466,617,359,800. If you find that number to be a little difficult to parse, try writing it in text: <em>two-trillion-four-hundred-and-sixty-six-billion-six-hundred-and-seventeen-million-three-hundred-and-fifty-nine-thousand-eight-hundred-dollars. </em></p>



<p>Below is a bubble chart showing all 2193 companies currently listed on the ASX sized in proportion to their market cap. You can hover over individual bubbles to see the full name of the company and its market cap. </p>







<p>As the bubble chart indicates, the vast bulk of the ASX is made up of just a handful of companies. In fact, the top 27 companies, a mere 1.2% of the ~2200 listed, account for over 50% of the total market cap:</p>







<p>The ASX 300, or 300 biggest companies by market cap, accounts for over 91% of the total, which is what popular index funds like VAS track; rather than buying shares in all 2193 companies, they just buy the biggest few hundred because the vast majority of publicly listed companies are such ‘small fish’. Small fish of course being a relative term – a company needs to be worth close to a billion dollars to make it into the ASX 300.</p>



<p>For example, The Reject Shop (TRS) with its 350 stores and nearly 6000 employees has a market cap of a mere $273 million, putting it in 557th place, not even on the radar of a typical index fund, and completely dwarfed by the current top dog, CBA: </p>







<p>Sadly the label won’t actually fit on The Reject Shop’s circle above because of its relative size to The Commonwealth Bank. </p>



<p>But don’t let that go to your head, CBA holders. You’re a big fish in a small pond, but you’re a tiny fish in a big pond. Plankton, really. Here’s the ASX next to Apple, the world’s largest publicly traded company:</p>







<p>Yes, you’re seeing that right – Apple is about 20% larger than the combined market cap of every Australian company put together. Here’s how things look when we add in 7 more of the world’s largest companies:</p>







<p>All of Australia’s public companies put together are roughly equivalent to a Microsoft or an Amazon, but significantly smaller than both Apple and Saudi Arabia’s ARAMCO. </p>



<p>Finally, here’s how the ASX looks next to some other exchanges.</p>







<p>As the visualisation shows, the ASX’s total 2.4T market cap pales into insignificance compared to the 38T and 17.4T market caps of the NYSE and Nasdaq. </p>



<p>According to the World Federation of Exchanges, the collective market capitalisation of the world’s stock exchanges is around 95 trillion US dollars, meaning the entire ASX represents well under 2% of the planet’s publicly listed companies.</p>

      <h2>What's all this, then?</h2>
      <p><strong>BLABRECS</strong> is a rules modification for the wordgame SCRABBLE that swaps out the dictionary of real-if-obscure English words for a capricious artificial intelligence. In BLABRECS, real English words aren't allowed! Instead, you have to play nonsense words that <em>sound</em> like English to the AI. These nonsense words are called – you guessed it – BLABRECS.</p>
      <h2>How do I play?</h2>
      <p>Get together your regular SCRABBLE supplies and pull up this page in a web browser. Then play SCRABBLE as normal, but before you play a word, use the "test a word..." box at the top of the page to check whether the AI will let you play it. Remember, you can only play words that the AI approves!</p>
      <p>When you find a legal word to play, hit the "Play It" button to add this word to the lexicon. As you play, you can write in definitions for all the words you've invented in the "Meaning" textbox next to each word. The player who comes up with the best definition for a word can add half of that word's points to their SCRABBLE score at the end of the game.</p>
      <h2>I found a real word that the AI thinks is playable! What should I do?</h2>
      <p>This happens often with proper nouns (which SCRABBLE generally disallows) and with inflected forms of base words that are disallowed. I think you should play by the spirit of BLABRECS and not the letter, but what this means is ultimately up to you. Is the game primarily about exploring the vast "shadow English" implied by the statistical distribution of letter sequences, or is it about the inherent absurdity of an external authority presuming to dictate your language to you? Either interpretation seems valid to me.</p>
      <h2>How does the AI work?</h2>
      <p>Right now it uses a Markov model trained on the <a href="https://www.wordgamedictionary.com/enable/">ENABLE word list</a> used in a number of wordgames. It looks at the statistical patterns of letter sequences in English words and uses this information to determine how likely a sequence of letters is to be a real English word. Then it rejects both real dictionary words and fake words that it deems insufficiently plausible. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/mkremins/blabrecs">source code</a> if you want to learn more.</p>
      <p>I might update BLABRECS to provide a wider range of AI "opponents" using a variety of different technologies in the future. Stay tuned!</p>
      <h2>Why is it called BLABRECS?</h2>
      <p>I generated every possible permutation of the word SCRABBLE and asked an early version of the AI to sort them from least to most statistically likely. BRABLECS won out by a significant margin, beating not only the real word SCRABBLE but also my hand-designed previous title BESCRALB. Then I switched the L and the R because BLABRECS sounds better and I'm not about to let a computer tell me what to do.</p>
      <h2>Who are you?</h2>
      <p>I'm <a href="https://mkremins.github.io/">Max Kreminski</a>, an artifical intelligence researcher and game designer. At the time of this release (December 2020), I'm working on my PhD in Computational Media at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I make a lot of weird stuff with AI; if you want to keep tabs on my work, you can <a href="https://twitter.com/maxkreminski">follow me on Twitter</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>There’s a resurgence in products using text as the primary user interface.</p>
<p>The most popular tool that uses text as a core UI is probably Microsoft Excel. Excel is a mostly-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> application, but when interacting with formulas and programming cells, the interface of choice for most users is text – typing in formulas as textual information, not clicking buttons. When we want to take the sum over a row, most of us click on the cell and type <code>=SUM(A3:A10)</code> – we don’t click on a “sum” button or unfurl a dropdown menu.</p>
<p>The poster child of textual user interfaces is the command line in the terminal. But I think a new crop of tools, combined with a more tech-savvy market, is staging the rebirth of text as a user interface. Textual interfaces are everywhere in the modern workplace. Slash-commands in Slack and Discord and Notion, hash-tags for channels and tagging, special syntax for searching and querying data across applications, @-mentions in social media and team work environments, and so on. We’re training ourselves to be more savvy users of the <em>textual interface</em>.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://thesephist.com/img/text-interface.jpg" alt="Text as an interface">
</p>
<h2 id="the-forces-at-work">The forces at work</h2>
<p>I think we’re seeing textual interfaces rise in popularity wherever people look for any of the following.</p>
<h3 id="progressive-feature-discovery">Progressive feature discovery</h3>
<p>Text interfaces within graphical UIs gained popularity in places with a high feature-to-visual-complexity budget. In other words, when there’s many more features than can fit comfortably on the screen at once, we hide that surplus complexity behind text options.</p>
<p>In many tools with a high degree of hidden complexity, the average user uses only a small subset of those features frequently. A Slack workspace, for example, might have a hundred slash-commands enabled, but each individual team member may only frequently use 5-10 of those commands on a regular basis. Rather than clutter up the interface with a hundred buttons or a web of dropdown menus, we hide the complexity behind text options, and the user can learn the few features they use most frequently, so they can access them again easily.</p>
<p>This idea applies to tools with a lot of complexity, where any single user might only take advantage of a small subset of that feature set. I think more tools are falling into this bucket as productivity tools consolidate. If a single kind of interface is shared by all business-chat clients, or all product-management tools, or version control software – rather than building custom interfaces for each workflow or use case, why not provide a wide surface area of functionality that’s accessible via text?</p>
<h3 id="extensibility-and-the-portable-interface">Extensibility and the portable interface</h3>
<p>Modern software workflows cross application and service boundaries all the time. Textual interfaces provide an enforceable, rigorous contract between services and applications that can act as the interfaces for apps to integrate with external services, in a way that visual interfaces can’t.</p>
<p>In a software development team, a proposal for a bug fix might flow through a task tracker, which connects with a team messaging app, where an engineer might run a group poll or lead a discussion. The request change might flow back into the task tracker, into a version control system like GitHub, and then deploy automatically to production servers.</p>
<p>Workflows like this require that apps from completely different vendors and domains are able to communicate with each other. More importantly, it requires that the interfaces we use to control these tools be <em>portable</em>. A portable interface carries the same kind of UI across different services, so the user can interact with any service similarly across all of its integrations. Portability means that we can enter data into our task tracker through our chat client, or request the rollout of a change through an infrastructure provider from our version control system.</p>
<p>These integration points are much easier to build, and easier to master as end users, when they all share the same, portable format – text.</p>
<h3 id="automation">Automation</h3>
<p>Textual interfaces make automation trivial, and automation tools much easier to build.</p>
<p>More people are using tools like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> and <a href="https://runalloy.com/">Alloy</a> to automate common business tasks or link very domain-specific workflows together across services. Having a shared portable interface across these apps, and a syntax format that can serve as a contract for how to use that interface, makes it possible for these automation points to communicate to dozens of other services easily. It also minimizes the possibility that a future update to the UI might break an automated workflow.</p>
<p>Text interfaces are much easier for machines to use. And as more work is done autonomously by the workflows we teach machines to perform, text interfaces are starting to matter just as much as human ones.</p>
<h3 id="sharability">Sharability</h3>
<p>People naturally want to document their workflows to remember, share, and iterate upon as a team. To share a graphical workflow, I’d need to record my screen or spend time writing down instructions for how to navigate a visual interface, clicking the right buttons and checking the right boxes. Reifying workflows as text makes this much easier – I can just encode a workflow into a few lines of text input.</p>
<p>In this way, workflows driven by text interfaces are easier to share, document, and iterate over time within a team. Text interfaces make workflows more concrete.</p>
<h2 id="workflows-not-data-are-the-subject-of-innovation">Workflows, not data, are the subject of innovation</h2>
<p>Given these benefits of text as an interface, weighted against the very real cost – text is a more esoteric way to use a computer – why are we seeing a resurgence in this trend now?</p>
<p>I think the easiest factor we can identify is that more people entering the workforce are unafraid of textual interfaces, because they’ve been typing and messaging and tagging their friends online all their life. They already interact with computers via text.</p>
<p>But the second reason that’s driving the industry to text is that <strong>the focus of software services has shifted from manipulating <em>data</em> to manipulating <em>workflows</em>.</strong> We’ve learned how to store and sift through data in our computers as a society, so we’re moving up a step of abstraction, to storing and sharing the how’s of our work, not just the what’s.</p>
<p>Workflows, not data, are the subject of product innovation now. And the subject is easier to study, to compare, to share and extend, when it’s concrete and durable, not an organic, ephemeral series of actions.</p>
<p>I think as long as we’re innovating on <em>how</em> we work, and how the services we use can work together more effectively, text as an interface is here to stay. And why not? The software industry has spent the last half-century building tools to help us wrangle with text, and we can rediscover those tools and ideas again.</p>
<p>We’re entering a renaissance of user interfaces, not in the sense of a novel paradigm shift, but in the sense of a rediscovery of classic, enduring ideas on which we can build better tools and systems. And I, for one, welcome it.</p>

<p>I wasn’t really paying attention, so maybe I’m the only one that hadn’t noticed, but Tesla’s market cap as of December 9th 2020 is a touch over 616 billion US dollars. That makes it kind of a big deal. In fact, it accounts for a full third of the global automaker market cap:</p>







<p>Just for a bit of context – Tesla only listed on the stock market 10 years ago (June 2010). The company itself was only founded in 2003. Compare that to Ford which launched in 1903 and basically invented the concept of mass production (the Model T is still one of the best selling cars of all time) or Benz in 1889, whose founder, Karl Benz, literally had a patent on the original goddamn automobile. </p>



<p>Here’s a racing bar chart of a few of the top automakers share prices over the last couple of decades. Tesla both literally and figuratively comes out of nowhere (spoiler alert: things get insane in 2019):</p>







<p>As you can see from the chart, the share price has pretty much 10x’d over the last 12 months. Why? Well, it’s certainly not because Tesla is making 10 times the revenue or shipping 10 times as many cars. In all of 2019, for example, Tesla shipped 367,500 cars. In Q3, 2020, they shipped 139,300 cars, giving them a run rate of around 550,000 cars for the entire year. For context, <strong>Toyota sold 927,623 cars in October 2020 alone</strong> (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://global.toyota/en/company/profile/production-sales-figures/" target="_blank">source</a>). </p>



<p>Here’s how Tesla compares to some of the automakers mentioned above in terms of yearly car sales:</p>







<p>No, I didn’t forget to add Tesla to the chart – you just can’t see the label because of how tiny the sales numbers are relative to other automakers (it’s that little blue sliver between Volkswagen and BMW if you still haven’t found it).</p>



<p>As you’d expect from the huge disparity in car sales shown above, Tesla’s revenues are also dwarfed by the bigger incumbents. Expected 2020 revenues are around 28 billion USD – impressive, but more than an order of magnitude less than VW’s 299 billion USD in 2019. </p>







<p>So why does the market have such a hard on for Tesla? As the chart above shows, Tesla’s market cap seems to be completely out of whack with its revenues and earnings (the latter was just 10 million USD in 2019). </p>



<p>The simple answer is that the market is valuing the VW’s, Toyota’s, and Daimler’s of the world on what they are – car companies. Tesla, on the other hand, is being valued as a tech business, and therefore what it *could* be. Car companies are boring and predictable. Technology companies though… Well, they have pretty much unlimited upside, don’t they?</p>



<p>Here are a few things Tesla has going for it.</p>



<ul><li>First, and most obviously, the electric car market is really just getting started. There are close to 100 million new cars per year sold globally, and less than 1% of them are electric, though this number is growing quickly – <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-autos-electric-idUSKBN27C08C">it’s already 5% in China</a> – and expected to surpass 50% in most developed nations by 2030. There is even some talk of the UK and EU <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/build-back-greener-boris-johnson-bans-petrol-cars-by-2030-20201119-p56fwn.html" target="_blank">banning sales</a> of new petrol and diesel cars in the not too distant future.<p>Tesla clearly has a first mover advantage here, and a lead on battery technology and EV engineering, though the quantum of this lead is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-battery-technology-electric-vehicles-engineering-51592842119" target="_blank">disputed</a>. </p></li><li>Tesla may be the first company to actually nail self-driving. After overpromising and underdelivering for years (in 2015, Musk predicted FSD could arrive by 2018), Tesla Full Self Driving appears to have <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cleantechnica.com/2020/12/07/tesla-full-self-driving-speed-bumps-cyclists-no-destination-lane-centering-with-on-street-parking-videos/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://cleantechnica.com/2020/12/07/tesla-full-self-driving-speed-bumps-cyclists-no-destination-lane-centering-with-on-street-parking-videos/" target="_blank">launched in beta</a> for some drivers, though early reports of its reliability are mixed.<br></li><li>Revenue growth to date. Sure, as we can see in the above chart, total revenues are still only a fraction of VW’s and Toyota’s, but 10 years ago Tesla had revenues of 100m USD compared to 2020’s projected 28B USD – that’s a roughly 28 fold increase. In the same period, VW’s revenue has increased by about 75%, and Toyota’s by only around 30%.<br></li><li>Well placed in solar and home energy storage. <br></li><li>The Tesla brand is cool, the Elon Musk brand is cool </li></ul>



<p>And finally, Tesla is, for pretty much the first time in its history doing something many of its critics said it would never do – <strong>actually turning a profit</strong>. The 10 million USD profit it made in 2019 was for all intents and purposes breaking even (and was driven largely by sale of regulatory credits), but in 2020 expected profits are a meaty looking 1.26B USD.</p>
