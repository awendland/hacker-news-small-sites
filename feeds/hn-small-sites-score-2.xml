<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><strong>Content amplification is one of the most underused&nbsp;pieces of the&nbsp;content marketing puzzle.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hands down.</strong></p>
<p><span>So many businesses create great content, but then they only publish that content on their own website, and maybe share it once or twice on social media.</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry to break it to you, but with millions of other businesses doing the same thing, that isn't going to help you cut through the noise.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At all.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And hoping that someone will just stumble across your content isn’t a good strategy, either.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In reality, you need to <strong>AMPLIFY YOUR CONTENT</strong></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Without content amplification, your hard work and effort will remain essentially “on the shelf collecting dust".</span></p>
<p><span>Creating content is less than half the battle. If you don't have a distribution, or amplification strategy for your content, then you're missing out on more traffic, more awareness, more backlinks, better SEO and a more engaged audience.</span></p>
<p><span>And, of course, all of the above <em>usually</em> lead to additional commercial benefits such as more customers and more sales.</span></p>
<p><span>In this article, we’re going to break down content amplification, tell you what it is, how it works, and how you can get the most out of it so your content can start to work harder and more effectively for you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We’re going to answer the most common questions we get that relate to content amplification, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>What is content amplification?</span></li>
<li><span>Why is content amplification so important?</span></li>
<li><span>How can I build a content amplification strategy?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>But enough with the preamble. Let’s jump in and get right into the good stuff.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://www.converge.today/uploads/engage/Content%202019/Mark%20Masters.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="150"></span></p>
<p><em>"The reason we shy away from content distribution or amplification is that it feels far better to be creative and produce, than it is to encourage people to watch/listen/read, as this side takes far more effort. Then again, the reason we are creating is to motivate people and get them to subscribe, enquire, interact and buy.</em></p>
<p><em>What is really important is to have something to say that can be amplified. Distribution channels work really well, once you have something to distribute. So, make sure that your message links to your values and that can strike a chord with others. This is how you find your allies, make sure your work is seen and people want to feel a part of it and prepared to stand with you."&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Mark Masters - <a href="https://www.wearethemedia.co.uk/">We Are The Media</a></em></strong></p>
<p>What is content amplification, and why is it so important?</p>
<p><span>Content amplification is the act of promoting and distributing your content across multiple channels (paid, owned and earned) so you can increase the reach and impact of both your content and your brand.</span></p>
<p><span>However, amplifying your content does more than simply provide your brand with additional exposure. It also allows you to position yourself as a thought leader, and build valuable backlinks, as well as build relationships, and increase both engagement and conversion rates with your target audience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are many different ways to amplify content. Paying to promote your content on Facebook or Twitter, leveraging influencers to promote your content, publishing your content on </span><a href="https://promos.converge.today/join-converge"><span>other platforms with an already captivated audience</span></a><span> - they’re all different ways to amplify your content, and we’ll get into them in a bit more detail later on.</span></p>
<p><span>Without amplification, it’ll be much more difficult for you to get the results you want from your content.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Every single day, there are</span><a href="https://www.worldometers.info/blogs/"><span> millions of new blogs published</span></a><span>. Yes, not all of them will be competing with what you’ve created, but that’s a lot of potential noise getting in the way of your message. And organic reach is getting lower and lower all the time.</span></p>
<p><span>Because organic reach across the board is down, way down, when it comes to creating content - and you may be producing the best stuff out there - the likelihood is that without amplifying your content, it’s not going to perform well.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://www.converge.today/uploads/engage/Content%202019/Cathy%20McPhillips.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="150"></span></p>
<p><em>“You’ve written an amazing article – and now what? You can’t expect the results to happen without some distribution work on your end. This includes content amplification – a multi-channel approach to increase your brand’s reach. It’s taking your owned media, and combining it with paid and earned media. It’s really knowing the right places – and people – to help amplify your message to your audience.</em></p>
<p><em>Through content amplification, you’re able to extend your reach into new areas you couldn’t achieve on your own through organic methods. It’s getting out of your echo chamber of your current customers and brand loyalists and finding new and relevant customers who wouldn’t have necessarily heard of you otherwise. Amplification done right brings customers to you who didn’t yet know how much they needed you.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Cathy McPhillips - <a href="http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/">Content Marketing Institute</a></em></strong></p>
<p>The problem with organic traffic</p>
<p><span>OK, that’s a little misleading. There is no problem with organic traffic.</span></p>
<p><span>The problem lies with the expectations people have when it comes to organic traffic. And, frankly, the delusion that generating it is both a) easily achievable and, b) that it is the only traffic source worth aiming for.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Nope.</span></p>
<p><span>Listen, organic traffic is great. It’s wonderful. If you’re getting huge organic traffic and your website and blogs are appearing right at the top of search results for your most relevant and valuable keywords and phrases, then brilliant! You’ve smashed it already.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Chances are, though, that’s not the case. Because, 1) only a handful of businesses across the entire planet can claim to have achieved the above. And it’s a constant battle for them to remain at the top. And, 2) organic reach is in decline </span><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/organic-reach-declining/"><span>across the board</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>We’re not saying achieving a first page ranking on Google for your content is impossible, but it may take both time and resources that you currently don’t have to get there. So, before you become a high-ranking Google superstar, you must find another way to get eyeballs on your content.</span></p>
<p><span>You need to amplify content so you can generate the consistent traffic and backlinks you need to get it the awareness and engagement it deserves, and to get it started on the long, arduous climb towards the first page of search results.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://www.converge.today/uploads/engage/Content%202019/Abby%20Sorensen.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="150"></span></p>
<p><em>“Imagine this scenario at the most important trade show in your industry - Your sales team picks up their badges and heads for the show floor, eager to make connections and meet potential buyers. Your product/service is the exact right fit for these prospects, and your message has been carefully crafted to resonate with them. But your booth is set up at the empty convention center across town. Maybe you were trying to stretch your budget. Or maybe you thought your product/service was so exciting that buyers would go out of their way to find you. Your sales team heads back to the office empty-handed, a complete waste of time and energy spent setting up your booth where your buyers were not.</em></p>
<p><em>This is exactly what happens when you create content with no plan to distribute it.<strong> Only a select few companies can afford to buy their way to the top of Google’s search rankings.</strong> The only way to get the most out of your content is to distribute it where your buyers are likely to be. And while your website might be the most strategized, optimized, digitized, mobilized website in your market, your buyers simply are not likely to spend a great deal of time there (especially if you hit them with gates and form-fills).”</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Abby Sorensen - <a href="https://www.followyourbuyer.com/">Follow Your Buyer</a></em></strong></p>
<p>Creating content is less than half the battle</p>
<p><span>That’s right. All that time you spent researching, planning, creating and publishing content is less than half of what’s required to give your content the best chance of generating the return on investment you want from it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Depending on who you talk to and the articles you read, you may have heard people saying content creation is anywhere from 20-40% of the job.</span></p>
<p><span>The rest of it? You guessed it; amplification/distribution/promotion - whatever you call it. Whatever it takes to get your content in front of everyone you want to read it.</span></p>
<p><span>But let’s not get bogged down in specific percentages. The only thing you need to know is that you need to spend more time promoting your hard work than you do creating it. Because the competition for attention is fierce, and you need to cut through the noise and make sure people are actually engaging with your content. Otherwise why spend the time creating it in the first place?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://www.converge.today/uploads/engage/Content%202019/Alexandra%20Cote.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="150"></span></p>
<p><em>"Beyond simply creating a really good post, you'll also need really great content amplification methods in place. In fact, everything that happens AFTER you publish a piece of content is much more important than the post itself. This is because sharing content across appropriate channels and talking about your findings and products gets your brand in front of more people.</em></p>
<p><em>This being said, content amplification is the core driver behind reaching your business goals and hitting your KPIs. Whether you want to improve your brand awareness, get more qualified leads, gain new partnerships, or just position yourself as a thought leader in the industry, content amplification can help you hit those targets. Do remember to stay away from vanity metrics though. Just because a lot of people like a post of yours on LinkedIn doesn't mean they read your article and it's a far cry from them actually making a purchase.</em></p>
<p><em>The best advice I have to ensure you're seeing real results from your content amplification techniques is to choose the right networks and websites to promote your content. You'll first need a clear image of your buyer persona. By analyzing potential customers and their behavior, you'll see where they spend most of their time and, above all, what determines them to make a purchase decision. Then, all you have to do is craft the right messaging revolving around the benefits they're looking to get and stay consistent on a couple of networks of choice. Feel free to include the same terms and pain points they use and remember to be responsive so the conversation is bidirectional."</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What are secrets in the software development world?</p><div><p>In the common language, a secret can be any sensitive data that we want to keep private. When discussing secrets in the context of software development, secrets generally refer to digital authentication credentials that grant access to systems or data. These are most commonly API keys, usernames and passwords, or security certificates.</p><p>Secrets exist in the context of applications that are no longer standalone monoliths. Applications nowadays rely on thousands of independent building blocks: cloud infrastructure, databases, SaaS components such as Stripe, Slack, HubSpot…&nbsp;</p><p>Secrets are what tie together these different building blocks of a single application by creating a secure connection between each component.</p></div><p>What is secret sprawl?</p><div><p>Secret sprawl is the unwanted distribution of secrets like API keys and credentials through multiple systems.&nbsp;</p><p>In modern software development, secrets are regularly used by developers and applications. As a result they often get shared through different services like Slack or email and can be stored in multiple locations including different machines, git repositories or inside company wikis. This is a phenomenon we call secret sprawl.</p></div><p>What are some of the best practices to securely manage secrets like API keys?</p><div><p>Storing and managing secrets like API keys and other credentials can be challenging. Even the most careful policies can sometimes be circumvented in exchange for convenience. We have put together a helpful <a href="https://blog.gitguardian.com/secrets-api-management/" target="_blank">cheat sheet</a> and article explaining the <a href="https://blog.gitguardian.com/secrets-api-management/" target="_blank">best practices for managing secrets</a>.</p><p>As a minimum here are some points you should consider:</p></div><div><p>Never store unencrypted secrets in git repositories</p></div><div><p>Avoid git add * commands on git</p></div><div><p>Add sensitive files in .gitignore</p></div><div><p>Don’t rely on code reviews to discover secrets</p></div><div><p>Use automated secrets scanning on repositories</p></div><div><p>Don’t share your secrets unencrypted in messaging systems like Slack</p></div><div><p>Store secrets safely (method to be used depends on every use case)</p></div><div><p>Default to minimal permission scope for APIs</p></div><div><p>Whitelist IP addresses where appropriate</p></div><p>What are the threats associated with secret sprawl?</p><div><p>When secrets are sprawled through multiple systems it increases what is referred to as the ‘attack surface’. This is the amount of points where an unauthorized user could gain access to your systems or data. In the case of secret sprawl, each time a secret enters another system it is another point where an attacker could gain access to your secrets.</p><p>Most internal systems are not an appropriate place to store sensitive information, even if those systems are private. No company wants credit card numbers in plaintext in databases, PII in application logs, bank account credentials in a Google Doc. Secrets benefit from the same kind of protective measures.</p><p>As a general security principle, where feasible, data should remain safe even if it leaves the devices, systems, infrastructure or networks that are under organizations’ control, or if they are compromised. This helps prevent credential stealing, which is a well-known adversary technique described in the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework:</p></div><p>“ Adversaries may search local file systems and remote file shares for files containing passwords. These can be files created by users to store their own credentials, shared credential stores for a group of individuals, configuration files containing passwords for a system or service, or source code/ binary files containing embedded passwords. ”<br></p><p>Secrets accessed by malicious threat actors can lead to information leakage and allow lateral movement or privilege escalation, as secrets very often lead to other secrets. Furthermore, once an attacker has the credentials to operate like a valid user, it is extremely difficult to detect the abuse and the threat can become persistent.<br></p><p>What are some of the biggest challenges associated with secret sprawl?</p><div><p>Because secrets tie together each component of an application, developers and ops need access to these secrets to build, connect, test and deploy applications. The result is that secrets need to be both tightly wrapped and also widely distributed. </p><p>Enforcing good security practices at the organization level is hard. Developers today can have large turnovers inside companies, be spread through many different teams and geographies. They have a growing number of technologies they must master and are under hard pressure due to shortened release cycles. This makes secret management very complicated and an ever changing challenge. </p><p>This is further complicated when VCS like git are introduced because secrets can be buried deep inside the history. The actual version of source code might look clean, while the history might present credentials that were added than later removed. Any secret reaching the Version Control System must be considered compromised and the presence of valid secrets in the git history presents a threat!</p></div></div></div>]]>

October 1, 2020 | https://www.gitguardian.com/secrets-detection/how-to-detect-secrets-in-source-code | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.gitguardian.com/secrets-detection/how-to-detect-secrets-in-source-code">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Why is it hard to detect secrets like API keys and other credentials?</p><div><p>Secrets detection is probabilistic—that is to say that it is not always possible to determine what is a true secret (or true positive). Because secrets share very few common, distinctive factors, decisions must be taken by aggregating weak signals to make strong predictions. </p><p>One of the most common factors is that almost all secrets are strings that look random. We call these strings high entropy strings. The issue is that this common factor is not very distinctive: 99% of strings that look random in source code aren’t secrets. They are for example database IDs or other types of false positives. </p><p>Of course, some secrets have fixed patterns: AWS keys often start with AKIA for example. But most secrets do not. The portions of code surrounding them are also very different, depending on what the secrets are used for and how they are used by the developers in the context of specific applications. Usernames and passwords can be used to authenticate in many different ways, and it is really hard to distinguish between real and fake credentials used as placeholders for example. </p><p>All this makes it extremely challenging to accurately capture all true secrets without also capturing false positives. At some point, a line in the sand needs to be drawn that considers the cost of a secret going undetected (a false negative) and compares it to the outcome that too many false positives would create. Different organizations with different people, cultures and workflows will draw different lines!</p></div><p>Why do code reviews fail at finding secrets in source code?</p><p>Code reviews are great overall for detecting logic flaws or maintaining certain good coding practices. But they are not adequate protection for detecting secrets, mostly for two reasons:<br></p><div><p>Reviews generally only consider the net difference between the current and proposed states. Not the entire history of changes. If a commit adds a secret and another one later deletes it, this has a zero net effect that is not of any interest to reviewers. But the vulnerability is there.</p></div><div><p>Reviewers prefer to focus on errors that cannot be automatically detected, like design flaws. As a general principle, security automation should be implemented wherever it can be, so that humans focus on where they bring the most value.</p></div><p>What is a "good" secrets detection algorithm?</p><div><p>Detecting secrets in source code is like finding needles in a haystack: there are a lot more sticks than there are needles, and you don’t know how many needles might be in the haystack. In the case of secrets detection, you don’t even know what all the needles look like!</p><p>Ideally, you want your detection system to achieve at the same time:</p></div><div><p>A low number of false alerts raised. We call this high precision. Precision answers the question: «What is the percentage of the secrets that you detect that are actual secrets?». This question is perfectly legitimate, especially in the context of security teams being overwhelmed with too many alerts.</p></div><div><p>A low number of secrets missed. This is what we call high recall. Considering that a single undetected credential can have a big impact for an organization, some organizations prefer to triage more false alerts but make sure they don’t miss a secret.</p></div><p>Balancing the equation to ensure that the algorithm captures as many secrets as possible without flagging too many false results is an intricate and extremely difficult challenge. Read more on evaluating <a href="https://blog.gitguardian.com/secrets-detection-accuracy-precision-recall-explained/" target="_blank">secrets detection algorithms</a>.<br></p><p>What is a false positive in secrets detection?</p><div><p>A false positive in secrets detection refers to when a secret candidate is wrongly marked as a true secret when it is in fact a non-sensitive string. </p><p>Typical examples of strings that can be mistaken for true secrets are:</p></div><div><p>UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) that are used for example by databases as unique keys.</p></div><div><p>High entropy URLs or file paths. They often contain random strings that look like keys.</p></div><p>Examples of server-side hooks:<br></p><div><p>Test keys. Service Providers sometimes provide developers with a set of test credentials with a very restricted scope so developers can exercise parts of the API without charging their account</p></div><div><p>Public keys. As surprising as it is, a very small number of keys are really meant to be public (like Firebase keys, see this Stack Overflow <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37482366/is-it-safe-to-expose-firebase-apikey-to-the-public" target="_blank">conversation</a>).</p></div><p>Are secrets detection algorithms language-dependent?</p><p>Secrets detection is, for the most part, not language specific. Of course, there are some subtleties to take into account, like the way variables are assigned in any programming language. But there is no need to support all the different syntaxes in their greatest details. This means that the same algorithms can be applied to any project, in any programming language, without using things like Abstract Syntax Trees.<br></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My source code is private, so why is hardcoding credentials in git considered a bad practice?</p><div><p>While private repositories offer some level of protection for your code they still do not have adequate protection to store information as sensitive as secrets. </p><p>Imagine if there was a plain text file with all your credit card numbers within it, you hopefully wouldn’t put this into the companies git repository.

Source code is a leaky asset and you never know where it is going to end up.

But this increases complexity and opens up a new set of security problems. With DevOps, existing security vulnerabilities can be magnified and manifest themselves in new ways. The speed of software creation can mean new vulnerabilities are created unseen by developers. The solution is to build security monitoring into the DevOps process from the start.”<br></p><p>Greg Day, RSA Conference Organizer (<a href="https://www.securityroundtable.org/the-biggest-cybersecurity-risks-in-2020/" target="_blank">source</a>)<br></p><p>Security now needs to be part of the SDLC from the start, and part of every incremental change. This concept is called Shifting Left, a development principle which states that security should move from the right (or end) of the SDLC to the left (the beginning). A great deal of automation is needed in order to be able to cope with running security checks at each incremental change. &nbsp;Automation helps streamline the detection, alerting and remediation processes and workflows.<br></p><p>How does secrets detection compare with Static Application Security Testing (SAST)?</p><div><p>Secrets detection is often confused with SAST because both scan through static source code. </p><p>SAST is mostly testing control structure, input validation, error handling, etc. Such vulnerabilities like SQL injection vulnerabilities only express themselves the moment the code is deployed. Exposed secrets are unlike these vulnerabilities, because any secret reaching version control system must be considered compromised and requires immediate attention. This is true even if the code is never deployed. </p><p>Implementing secrets detection is not only about scanning the most actual version of your master branch before deployment. It is also about scanning through every single commit of your git history, covering every branch, even development or test ones.</p><p>To conclude, SAST is concerned only with the current version of a project, the version that is going to be deployed, whereas secrets detection is concerned with the entire history of the project.</p></div><p>What are git hooks?</p><div><p>Git hooks are scripts that are triggered by certain actions in the software development process, like committing or pushing. By automatically pointing out issues in code, they allow reviewers not to waste time on mistakes that can be easily diagnosed by a machine. </p><p>There are client-side hooks, that execute locally on the developers’ workstation, and server-side hooks, that execute on the centralized version control system.</p><p>Examples of client-side hooks:</p></div><p>Examples of server-side hooks:<br></p><p>What is a pre-commit hook?</p><div><p>"The pre-commit hook is run first when committing, before you even type in a commit message. It’s used to inspect the snapshot that’s about to be committed, to see if you’ve forgotten something, to make sure tests run, or to examine whatever you need to inspect in the code. </p><p>Exiting non-zero from this hook aborts the commit, although you can bypass it with <span>git commit --no-verify</span>. You can do things like check for code style (run lint or something equivalent), check for trailing whitespace, or check for appropriate documentation on new methods."</p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks" target="_blank">git-scm</a><br></p><p>What is a pre-receive hook?</p><div><p>A pre-receive hook is a script that runs on the server. It performs checks on the content of the push; if it exits non-zero, the push is rejected. You can use this hook to do things like prevent a PR author from merging their own changes, or require commit messages to follow some specific guidelines. </p><p>Be careful when using pre-receive hooks as they are blocking: if the checks don’t pass, the server is not updated.</p></div><p>What is a post-receive hook?</p><p>"The post-receive hook runs after the entire process of pushing code to the server is completed and can be used to update other services or notify users. Examples include emailing a list, notifying a continuous integration server, or updating a ticket-tracking system – you can even parse the commit messages to see if any tickets need to be opened, modified, or closed. This script can’t stop the push process, but the client doesn’t disconnect until it has completed, so be careful if you try to do anything that may take a long time."<br></p><p>Source: <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks" target="_blank">git-scm</a><br></p><p>Unlike the pre-receive hook, post-receive is non-blocking.<br></p><p>Where in the DevOps pipeline to implement automated secrets scanning? Client-side or server-side?</p><div><p>The earlier a security vulnerability is uncovered, the less costly it is to correct. Hardcoded secrets are no exceptions. If the secret is uncovered after the secret reaches centralized version control server-side, it must be considered compromised, which requires rotating (revoking and redistributing) the exposed credential. This operation can be complex and typically involves multiple stakeholders.</p><p>Client-side secrets detection early in the software development process is a nice-to-have as it will prevent secrets entering the VCS earlier. </p><p>Server-side secrets detection is a must have:</p></div><div><p>&nbsp;Server-side is where the ultimate threat lies. From the server, the code can uncontrollably spread in a lot of different places, with the hardcoded secrets in it.</p></div><div><p>Implementing client-side hooks on an organization level is hard. This is something we have heard many application security professionals claim they are not confident to do, due to the difficulty to deploy and update this on every developer’s workstation.</p></div><div><p>Client-side hooks can and must be easy to bypass (remember secret detection is probabilistic). Usage of client side hooks largely comes down to the individual developers’ responsibility. Hence the need to have visibility over the later stages.</p></div><p>Should secrets detection be blocking or non-blocking in the SDLC?</p><div><p>From our experience, when trying to impose rules that are too constraining, people will bend them, often in an effort to collaborate better and do their job. Security must not be a blocker. It should allow flexibility and enable information to flow, yet enable visibility and control. </p><p>On one hand, security measures will be bypassed, sometimes for the worst. But on the other hand, it is also good sometimes that the developer can take the responsibility to bypass them. </p><p>Because even the best algorithms can fail and need human judgement. Secrets detection is probabilistic: algorithms achieve a tradeoff between not raising false alerts and not missing keys.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>A Dutch man who has been unable to move and speak for eight years due to brain damage, can temporarily do so after taking the sleeping drug Zolpidem.  Brain scans show that the sleeping pill removes an obstacle to these actions, scientists from Radboudumc and Amsterdam UMC report Thursday.</p>
<p>In men, the brain activity for moving and talking is drowned out by the brain activity for the transfer of information.</p>
<p>“You could compare the brain, as it were, to a large string orchestra”, explains fellow researcher Hisse Arnts.  “With Richard (the man, ed.) The first violins play so loud that they drown out the other members of the string orchestra and people can no longer hear each other. Zolpidem ensures that these first violins play more ‘pianissimo’, so that everyone back within time. “</p>
<p>The fact that the man does not go to sleep because of Zolpidem is probably due to the way his brain has become confused, Arnts thinks.  The problem, however, is that the man gets used to the sleeping aid, so that the effect becomes shorter and shorter.  Yet he still receives it regularly and the discovery is a promising starting point for further research.</p>
<p>The man is not the first to return to a normal situation briefly with such a means;  there are similar reports from Italy and South Africa.  But how that is possible has now been determined for the first time on the basis of scans, according to the medical centers.</p>

<p>The man, in his late twenties at the time, suffered a severe lack of oxygen eight years ago due to choking.  He ended up in a nursing home with the very rare diagnosis of akinetic mutism.  Because Richard’s situation seemed hopeless, it was decided to give him the remedy.</p>

<p>In his first media interview following his poisoning, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny expresses his "tremendous gratitude to all Germans" in an interview with the newsmagazine DER SPIEGEL. In the interview, he says that although he never had close ties to Germany, it was German politicians and Chancellor Angela Merkel who saved his life. He says the doctors at Berlin's Charité University Hospital saved his life for a second time and nursed him back to health. "I know it sounds a bit over the top, but Germany has become a special country for me," Navalny says. Describing the personal visit paid to him by Merkel last week, he says: "I was impressed by the detail she knows about <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/thema/russia_en/" data-link-flag="english">Russia</a> and my case."</p>



<section data-area="contentbox">

<p>Navalny says he is doing "much better than three weeks ago, and things are getting better each day." The doctors say he could get back to 90 percent of his former self, perhaps even 100 percent, although no one knows for sure. "Basically, I’m a bit of a guinea pig," he says. "There aren’t many people you can observe who are still alive after being poisoned with a nerve agent." Describing the moment in the airplane when the poison started to take effect, Navalny says: "You feel no pain, but you know you’re dying. And I mean, right now. Even though nothing hurts you." You just think: This is the end. "Organophosphorus compounds attack your nervous system like a DDos attack attacks the computer - it's an overload that breaks you," he told DER SPIEGEL.</p>

<div>
<p>"I assert that <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/thema/vladimir_putin_en/" data-link-flag="english">Putin</a> was behind the crime, and I have no other explanation for what happened." Despite the attempt on his life, he says he wants to return to Russia. "And my job now is to remain the guy who isn’t afraid. And I’m not afraid! When my hands shake, it’s not from fear – it’s from this stuff. I would not give Putin the gift of not returning to Russia."</p><p>When asked whether he thinks Germany should stop the completion of the Nord Stream 2 Russian gas pipeline project, Navalny didn’t want to answer. "That’s Germany’s business. Decide for yourself!" Any strategy toward Russia must "take into account the level of insanity that Putin has reached."</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Are you an 8-bit or a 32-bit programmer? </p>

<p>At OMZLO, we have been mainly focussing our development efforts on newer 32-bit Arm-Cortex chips (STM32 and SAMD), which typically offer more RAM, more speed, more peripherals, at a similar or lower price-point than older 8-bit MCUs. But 8-bit MCUs are far from dead. Microchip has notably released a new series of chips, collectively branded as the "tinyAVR 0-series", which offer more modern peripherals than the older AVR chips at a very competitive price point. They seem like the perfect candidate for simple products that don't need all the features and fine-tuning capabilities of the newer 32-bit MCUs. 8-bit MCUs are also substantially simpler to program, which translates into faster development time. </p>

<p>Thanks to the success of the Arduino UNO, there are tons of tutorials online that explain how to program 8-bit Atmega328 microcontrollers and their cousins like the Attiny85 using direct register access, without the Arduino language or any vendor IDE such as Atmel Studio. Just google "atmega328 blinky". All you need is an AVR C-compiler, a text editor, <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/">avrdude</a>, and an AVR programmer. Some <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Getting-Started-With-the-ATMega328P/">resources</a> even show how to also build the electronics needed to get a basic atmega328 running on a breadboard. However, it's hard to find the same information for these newer "tinyAVR 0" chips.</p>

<p>Of course, Microchip offers all the tools necessary to program these newer "TinyAVR" MCUs with their windows-only IDE. There are also "Arduino cores" for some of these newer "TinyAVR" MCUs that let you program them with the Arduino IDE. But again, if you like to write code for MCUs in "baremetal" style, with your favorite text editor, a makefile, and a c-compiler, there are few resources available online. </p>

<p>In this blog post, we will describe how to program a <a href="https://www.ladyada.net/learn/proj1/blinky.html">blinky</a> firmware on an <strong>Attiny406</strong>, from the ground up, using the simplest tools. Most of the things described here can be easily transposed to other TinyAVR MCUs. Our approach is generally guided toward macOS or Linux users, but should also be applicable in an MS-Windows environment with a few minor changes.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<p>We decided to play with the <a href="https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATTINY406">Attiny406</a>, with a view of using it in the future to replace the Attiny45 we currently use on the <a href="https://www.omzlo.com/articles/the-piwatcher">PiWatcher</a>, our Raspberry-Pi watchdog. The Attiny406 has 4K of flash space, 256 bytes of RAM, and can run at 20Mhz without an external clock source.</p>

<p>One of the most important differences between the new TinyAVR MCUs and the older classic AVR MCU like the Attiny85 is that the newer chips use a different programming protocol called UPDI, which requires only 3 pins, as opposed to the 6-pin ISP on the classic AVRs.</p>

<p>A little research shows that programming TinyAVRs with UPDI can be achieved with a simple USB-to-serial cable and a resistor, thanks to a python tool called <a href="https://github.com/mraardvark/pyupdi">pyupdi</a>, which suggests the following connection diagram for firmware upload:</p>
<pre>                        Vcc                     Vcc

</pre>
<h3 id="shematic">shematic</h3>

<p>We created a minimalistic breakout board for the Attiny406. The board can be powered by 5V through USB or a lower 3.3V through dedicated VCC/GND pins. An LED and a button were also fitted on the board. For testing purposes, we decided to embed the 4.7K resistor needed for the UPDI programming directly in the hardware (i.e. resistor <em>R2</em>). 
This gives us the following schematic:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.omzlo.com/uploads/attiny406-schematic.png" alt="schematic"></p>

<h3 id="board">Board</h3>

<p>The resulting breakout board is tiny and fits conveniently on a small breadboard. The design files are <a href="https://aisler.net/p/SIEGFIYL">shared on aisler.net</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.omzlo.com/uploads/std_attiny-406-breadboard.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Programming the Attiny406 on the board with a USB-serial cable is done by connecting the headers on the board edge:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.omzlo.com/uploads/attiny406-prog.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<h3 id="pyudpi">pyudpi</h3>

<p>We installed <strong>pyupdi</strong> following the instructions provided on <a href="https://github.com/mraardvark/pyupdi">their webpage</a>. </p>

<p>We connected our USB-Serial cable to the board with the 4 dedicated UPDI pins available on the board. Our USB-Serial converter shows up as the file <code>/dev/tty.usbserial-FTF5HUAV</code> on a MacOS system.</p>

<p>To test that the programmer recognizes the Attiny406, you can issue a command similar to the following, adapting the path for the USB-serial converter to your setup:</p>
<pre>pyupdi -d tiny406 -c /dev/tty.usbserial-FTF5HUAV -i
</pre>
<p>This should result in the following output if all goes well:</p>
<pre>Device info: {'family': 'tinyAVR', 'nvm': 'P:0', 'ocd': 'D:0', 'osc': '3', 'device_id': '1E9225', 'device_rev': '0.1'}
</pre>
<h3 id="the-c-compiler">The C compiler</h3>

<p>The typical <strong>avr-gcc</strong> available on macOS with <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> did not seem to recognize the Attiny406 as a compiler target, so we went off to install the avr-gcc compiler provided by Microchip, which is available <a href="https://www.microchip.com/mplab/avr-support/avr-and-arm-toolchains-c-compilers">here</a>. Downloading the compiler requires you to create an account on the Microchip website, which is a bit annoying. </p>

<p><img src="https://www.omzlo.com/uploads/avr-toolchain.png" alt="AVR toolchain link"></p>

<p>Once downloaded, we extracted the provided archive in a dedicated directory. The <code>bin</code> directory in the archive should be added to the <code>PATH</code> variable to make your life easier. Assuming the downloaded compiler is stored in the directory <code>$HOME/Src/avr8-gnu-toolchain-darwin_x86_64</code>, the PATH can be altered by adding the following line to your <code>.bash_profile</code> file:</p>
<pre>export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/Src/avr8-gnu-toolchain-darwin_x86_64/bin/
</pre>
<p>Newer Attiny MCUs are not supported out of the box by the Microchip <strong>avc-gcc</strong> compiler. You need to download a dedicated <em>Attiny Device Pack</em> from <a href="http://packs.download.atmel.com/">their website</a>, as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.omzlo.com/uploads/microchip-pack-repository.png" alt="AVR toolchain link"></p>

<p>The resulting downloaded <em>Device Pack</em> is named <code>Atmel.ATtiny_DFP.1.6.326.atpack</code> (or similar depending on versioning). Though the extension is <code>.atpack</code>, the file is actually a zip archive. We changed the extension to <code>.zip</code> and extracted the package in the directory <code>$HOME/Src/Atmel.ATtiny_DFP.1.6.326</code> next to the compiler files. </p>

<h3 id="c-program">C program</h3>

<p>We created the following program that blinks the LED on pin PB5 of our Attiny board at a frequency of 1Hz.</p>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre>
<p>The code looks very similar to what you would see on a classic AVR "blinky" program. One visible change is the use of structures to access various registers of the MCU: e.g instead of setting bits in <code>PORTB</code>, you access <code>PORTB.DIRSET</code>.</p>

<p>The other visible change is the clock setup code <code>_PROTECTED_WRITE(CLKCTRL.MCLKCTRLB, 0)</code>. Out of the box, at reset, the Attiny406 runs at 3.33Mhz, which corresponds to a base frequency of 20Mhz with a 6x clock divider applied. To enable the full 20Mhz speed, the register <code>CLKCTRL.MCLKCTRLB</code> is cleared. Because this register needs to be protected against accidental changes, the Attiny406 requires a specific programming sequence to modify it. Fortunately, this is natively offered by the macro <code>_PROTECTED_WRITE</code>. More details are available in the <a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/ATtiny406-DataSheet-DS40001976B.pdf">Attiny406 datasheet</a>.</p>

<p>In comparison with an STM32 or a SAMD21, the code is blissfully simple. </p>

<h3 id="makefile">Makefile</h3>

<p>We assume the following directory structure where:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Src/Atmel.ATtiny_DFP.1.6.326/</code> is the location of the Microchip <em>Device Pack</em></li>
<li><code>Src/attiny406-test/</code> is the directory where the code above is stored in a file called <code>main.c</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Compiling the code can be done by issuing the following command within <code>attiny406-test/</code> directory,:</p>
<pre>avr-gcc -mmcu=attiny406 -B ../Atmel.ATtiny_DFP.1.6.326/gcc/dev/attiny406/ -O3 -I ../Atmel.ATtiny_DFP.1.6.326/include/ -DF_CPU=20000000L -o attiny406-test.elf main.c
</pre>
<p>An <code>-O</code> optimization flag is required to make the <code>_delay_ms()</code> function calls work successfully, as well as defining the variable F_CPU to reflect the expected chip clock speed. The rest of the parameters provide the location of the Attiny406 device-specific files we previously extracted from the <em>Device Pack</em>.</p>

<p>Uploading the firmware to the MCU requires a conversion to the intel HEX format and a call to the <strong>pyupdi</strong> tool. To address all these steps, we created a simple Makefile.</p>

<p>To compile the code, we simply type <code>make</code>. Uploading is done with <code>make flash</code>. This Makefile can be further enhanced as needed.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>With the right tools, baremetal programming on the new TinyAVR MCUs is as simple as on its older AVR cousins. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/img/posts/hacktoberfest.webp" alt="Post cover image"><h2 id="what-is-asyncapi">What is AsyncAPI</h2><p>AsyncAPI is a specification for describing your <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/getting-started/event-driven-architectures/">event-driven architecture</a>. You are probably using already <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/getting-started/coming-from-openapi/">OpenAPI/Swagger specification</a> for describing your synchronous RESTful APIs. AsyncAPI is something that supplements OpenAPI. As an example, you should use AsyncAPI when your services do not talk to each other directly but through a message broker.</p><p>In contrast to the OpenAPI Initiative, AsyncAPI Initiative is focused not only on creating and evolving the AsyncAPI specification but also on its tooling. It is a vendor-neutral space for the community to work together on the spec and its tools. We work on tools like specification parsers or docs and code generators.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pU71J-F7pfI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 id="what-is-hacktoberfest-and-why-asyncapi-initiative-joins-it">What Is Hacktoberfest And Why AsyncAPI Initiative Joins It</h2><p><a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest</a> is a well-known event that promotes open source contributions. In short, you have the entire October to submit four pull requests to any project you want, and in exchange, you get a super cool t-shirt. Is that it? Is it just for a t-shirt? Nah, the t-shirt is nice but what you also get is easy access to open source world. Maintainers of many projects open up for contributions, and it is a great chance to make your first step to joining this fantastic world.</p><p>AsyncAPI Initiative joins the Hacktoberfest for two main reasons:</p><ul><li>Promote AsyncAPI Initiative as a place where we don't work on the specification only but also build a lot of great tools</li><li>Make it much easier for the community to make the first contribution to one of the AsyncAPI repositories</li></ul><p>In the past, we were also there where you are now, shy and uncertain if we can impact open source community. We want to give you an easy path to take the first baby steps in the world of open source in a welcoming and friendly environment.</p><blockquote><p>Don't forget to <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/login">sign up</a> to the Hacktoberfest</p></blockquote><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_1WRr3Ml9t4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 id="how-can-you-help">How Can You Help</h2><p>There is always a lot of work waiting out there. For the sake of this special event, we prepared around 75 GitHub issues that you can pick up. They represent different areas (for example, JavaScript or HTML), different difficulty (for example, 50 issues are easy), and different repositories. No matter if they are trivial or demanding, all of them are important for us. Even with trivial ones where you, for example, need to remove a semicolon, we will still be super happy because this will improve the quality of the project (SonarCloud reports). In other words, every single issue from <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vX4J395apexutfQ0OSqPNltFKDacmemHZwCmOXwHNLo/edit?usp=sharing">this</a> list is important.</p><h3 id="1-pick-the-right-issue">1. Pick The Right Issue</h3><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vX4J395apexutfQ0OSqPNltFKDacmemHZwCmOXwHNLo/edit?usp=sharing">Here</a> you can find a list of all the issues that you can work on. Most of the issues are about code contribution, but not all of them. There are also issues about documentation or CI/CD configuration (we use GitHub Actions). Just pick the issues you want to work on, one at a time, and let us know in the comments section that you want to work on it.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iqs_2BiNEEo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h3 id="2-setup-your-environment-and-create-a-first-pull-request">2. Setup Your Environment And Create A First Pull Request</h3><p>Once you <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">install Git</a> on your machine and get a <a href="https://github.com/join">GitHub account</a>, you need first to decide if you are here just for Hacktoberfest or longer, and make sure if your issue is easy and maybe you can complete it in the GitHub UI. </p><p>In case you are here just for the Hacktoberfest, and you picked easy issues that involve changes only to a single file, there is no need to install Git and complicate your life. GitHub UI enables you to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-your-repository">make changes to a single file online</a>.</p><p>In case you:</p><ul><li>want to stay with us longer,</li><li>you picked up an issue where you need to make changes to more than just one file,</li><li>you also need to run the project locally to check if it works</li></ul><p>Then follow <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/git-workflow.md">this</a> short instruction on how to fork the repository and set it up locally.</p><p>Once you are ready with your changes, submit a pull request. Be nice and follow our <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">code of conduct</a> and make sure your pull request is <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#conventional-commits">described properly</a>.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BsC5tu4M1rw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 id="office-hours">Office Hours</h2><p>Do you feel overwhelmed? No need. You can do it. Just take this blog post seriously. </p><p>Trust me when I write that every pull request is crucial for us.
Trust me when I write that we are a welcoming community.
Don't be afraid that you will waste our time. If we would think about it this way, we would not even join the Hacktoberfest.</p><p>Still not sure if you can make it? Don't worry. We want to host office hours throughout the event, 2x a week, 1h long, and different time zones. You can join whenever you want and ask us anything, or do pair programming with us.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><section><div><div><div><div><div><div>
<p>This is a reflection on software development and complexity. Let's start with
some quotes to make me look smart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple
system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and
cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working
simple system -- <em>Gall's law</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I only came across this quote recently, but I think that it summarizes what
I've learned these past seven years. Another idea that I've found in a few books
is that programming in isolation is problem-solving, but software engineering
is all about managing complexity. This distinction between programming and
software engineering makes sense to me, probably because of my mental models.
I'm sure we can all disagree on this, but that's not the topic of today.
Complexity is.</p>
<h2>Complexity</h2>
<p>Almost everyone I know in the software industry wants to build products that
solve real and challenging problems. Change the world! The last thing you want
is to build another CRUD application. They are fine, but it gets boring after
a while.</p>
<p>Most of us will get bored without novelty. That's why the software industry has
a recycling mechanism to keep things fresh and interesting for us: every once
in a while a new, or different, language/framework will rise and light the path
for a brighter future, overthrowing the existing standard, demanding that we
learn it to be on top of the game.</p>
<p>We change our tools, but we keep building the same things over and over. I've
been doing this long enough to see that we are just going in circles. Let's be
honest, most of us aren't building life-changing products that wouldn't have
been possible ten years ago, so let's not jump straight into another shiny
technology that just came out and is going to solve all of our problems.</p>
<h2>Solutions, solutions, solutions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>For a while, the solution to every problem I encountered was a Rails app. --
<em>this one is mine</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over the years, I've seen companies rewrite their products to change languages,
frameworks, or architectures because they were told that the change would make
their product better, run faster, and scale. By the way, you're only a true
Ruby developer after you've heard the question "but does it scale?" at least
one hundred times (kidding, but it'll happen).</p>
<p>Think about it, how many times were you sold a new programming language,
technology, or a concept like microservices, serverless, event sourcing, clean
architecture, micro frontends. There are many preachers in the software world.</p>
<p>At Subvisual, we started using Elixir a lot these past years, so I've learned
a bit about the history of Erlang. If you don't know, Erlang uses the Actor
Model, and the interesting part is that the designers of Erlang only learned
about the Actor Model after having designed Erlang. This is important because
the designers of Erlang didn't start with the intent of applying the Actor
Model; it came as a solution to fault-tolerant distributed programming.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail <em>Abraham Maslow</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The designers of Erlang picked the right tool for the job and most of us want
to do the same. Unfortunately, there's usually more than one "tool" that would
be "right," but to know which ones, you need to know what "job" you're solving.
All of us <strong>should</strong> know this, but I keep learning about teams that fail to do
it. There are so many companies, with a handful of experienced developers, that
don't know what they are building, don't have a clear business yet, but their
product is already built on complex architectures and technologies such as
microservices, Kubernetes or event-sourcing.</p>
<h2>Improving</h2>
<p>Every project we start from scratch is an opportunity to do it right. We'll
think to ourselves: <em>This time I won't fall into the same traps! I have learned
my lessons, I've studied the books, and I even met some of my gurus that wrote
them! This time I'll follow "industry standards"!</em></p>
<p><em>I am the "architect"; I will design the perfect system! Without me, none of
this will be possible. Those mindless programmers have no idea what they are
doing. I, and only I, am the true heir of Martin Fowler!</em></p>
<p>This was a bit dramatic, but I needed a break from all of that whining. I know
it's easy to fall into these traps. It's even easier when your company raised
money, and everyone is expecting you to deliver the absolute best product ever
because they are paying you for it! This is why your starting team is so
important; they have to withstand the pressure. They must know that to build
the grand vision, they have to go one step at a time.</p>
<h2>The decision</h2>
<p>I've made many bad decisions, and I've been fortunate enough to suffer the
consequences of those decisions. A lot of developers don't get to experience
consequences, so they never learn.</p>
<p>So what was the worst decision of my career? I don't know. But the title of
this blog post is inspired by something an old colleague said. At the time, we
were working for a product company that reached for event-driven architecture
and event-sourcing too soon. They knew little about their market, and the
choices the software team made were crippling their ability to change. Business
rules were almost set in stone. Migrating data was a pain and the source of
many bugs. And unfortunately, because the team didn't have experience with
event-sourcing, the event store, which kept the state of all services, was also
being used as an event-bus to communicate between services. Because of that, it
was possible to couple one service to the internal state of another, which
happened a lot. This almost invisible coupling made everything worse.</p>
<p>What did we do against such an unpredictable system? We took it apart: merging
services that were too coupled; defining clear boundaries between services;
moving some services away from the event-store into a traditional database;
making some communication channels synchronous; writing integration and
end-to-end tests.</p>
<p>When we were finished it was still an unnecessarily complex system, but it was
one that we could change with some confidence. After that, we defined
a long-term plan for the product's architecture and technology, but we didn't
implement it. We waited for the right moment when something was starting to
slow us down to make a small step in that direction. When the business goals
changed, we changed our long-term plan, and once again made small steps in that
direction when we felt the need for it.</p>
<p>Eventually, complexity found its way again into the codebase, but it was fine
because the codebase was evolving slowing, adding and removing complexity when
necessary.</p>
<h2>Making the right call</h2>
<p>Was that the worst decision of his career? I don't think so. The issue with him
going for event-sourcing and event-driven architecture was that it wasn't the
right moment, but my colleague didn't know that. He thought the goals for the
next years were well defined, but unfortunately, they never are.</p>
<p>Should you use microservices or event-sourcing? Maybe, it depends on the
context and the client. The decisions I make are the best that I can with the
information that I have. For instance, when I'm part of the team that's
starting a product, the technology we pick will depend on how we'll hire: if
you want to build an office in Portugal, we have to make sure we have
developers for that technology available. We have to think things through, and
some things you only learn from experience. This applies to the systems we
design as well. I've seen enough people design around what they believe the
product will become in two years to know that those designs always fail to
accommodate the changes that will come. So we design systems for small,
incremental changes. Do the smallest thing that will get us started and
doesn't compromise our ability to change once we know what the business needs.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wrapper"><div id="container"><div><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Full disclosure: things discussed in this post are, to be frank, quite obvious. My intent is not so much to teach a reader something new, as to remind him what might have been forgotten. After all, anyone who does a single kind of work daily for years inevitably develops habits and mental-shortcuts that are <em>usually</em> useful but can misfire from time to time. After all, software development is too complex and too technical to be guided by subconscious intuition.</p><p>Pilots use pre-flight checks to combat this kind of problem, so why not developers? Here’s a check-list of things I find important to consider <strong>before</strong> writing the first line of code.</p><h3 id="set-your-target-straight">Set your target straight</h3><p>Imagine yourself solving these tasks:</p><ul><li>generating a single-use report for an established company</li><li>writing a feature in proof-of-concept MVP for a startup</li><li>extending at enterprise product that has 20 years of codebase support guarantee in its SLAs</li></ul><p>Clearly, it wouldn’t be smart to blindly apply the same set of software development best-practices for all three cases. You probably don’t need a perfectly polished code for a single-use report. A startup that operates in the “rush to market before we run out of money" mode is much more worried about the feature working than about its performance. Long-support code needs to be first and foremost maintainable. Also, if you’re working on a pet-project for fun, you might gasp skip writing tests (unless you enjoy writing tests, in which case I envy you a little bit). Some developers take so much pride in their craft that they lose sight of the forest behind the trees. Following all best practices and writing state-of-the-art code <em>feels</em> right, but logically it’s not the only option. Sometimes you should consciously generate technical debt. Reality constraints are not something that can be ignored.</p><p>As self-evident as this advice is, we’ve all heard stories where things went wrong because of misaligned goals. “Premature optimization” is a common special case. Refactoring an old codebase that rarely changes, just so it’s pretty, is another one. And to not leave you with the thought that goal misalignment is always linked to perfectionism: writing an unsupportable code to meet a <em>fictional</em> deadline, either self-imposed or forced on to developers by impatient management, is the same kind of error.</p><p>You need to know where to go before you can start thinking about how to get there. Think of the most important criteria your solution needs to fulfill and align your decision-making with those.</p><h3 id="consider-alternatives">Consider alternatives</h3><p>You’ve got the task in front of you, requirements are pretty clear, and you vaguely remember how you did something similar a few years before. Or maybe you don’t know how to solve it at first, but after some googling, you get a general idea. Start coding?</p><p>There are always multiple ways to solve a problem. The first viable solution is unlikely to be an optimal one. By focusing on the first approach discovered you rob yourself of choice. Do a thorough research first, and after you have options in front of you, carefully consider the pros and cons of each. There is no magical number of solutions you need. I often set the minimum bound to three for myself.</p><p>Selecting the right tool for a job is an obvious example of a decision that benefits from upfront research, and even then, in a real-world scenario, a tool that’s familiar often gets selected over the tool that fits. Don’t think this advice only applies to „macro“ decisions, it can be applied just as well for your everyday code design choices.</p><h3 id="consult-the-docs-yes-upfront">Consult the docs. Yes, upfront</h3><p>It’s impossible to keep up with the pace modern tech is moving. Doesn’t matter how many years of experience you have under your belt, when you pick up the project on a modern stack there will be tools and libraries, released recently, that have slipped under your radar. So most developers are in a constant in-flight-learning mode: picking up knowledge as they search answers on immediate questions. It’s an efficient way to learn, but it creates a risk of missing an easy solution because of the inability to form the right question.</p><p>Skimming the docs upfront, without digging deep into any particular topic, doesn’t take much time, but it helps create mental anchors, which your brain will fetch when you encounter the problem. You will have a better starting point for finding the right answer quickly.</p><h3 id="design-your-apis">Design your APIs</h3><p>The hardest part of writing code is to imagine in the minutest details how to handle each workflow, each exceptional situation, and each edge case. Many developers first solve a problem, then write a „wrapper“ to expose their work to the outside world through some kind of API (i don’t mean just REST API, function signatures and interfaces are APIs as well). Often this bottom-up design leads to an API that’s too „technical“, i.e. leaking it’s abstractions to the consumer. It’s hard to make your brain switch from one level of abstraction to another.</p><p>Before starting the work on implementation, put yourself in the shoes of the API user first (even if that user is you). What would be the user’s most common usage pattern? What’s the absolute minimal required set of parameters the API needs to have? Which terminology makes sense for the user? What input format would be most convenient? What defaults to set? It’s up to you how thorough you want this process to be.</p><h3 id="split-up-the-work">Split up the work</h3><p>Each entity in a system exponentially increases the number of possible interactions. Code that’s easy to reason about forms a pyramid of abstraction layers, each one hiding its inner workings from the layer above. Each layer can be reasoned about independently, limiting the amount of „moving parts“ you need to keep track of in your brain. If you succeed in splitting the task into multiple loosely coupled entities upfront, you will simplify your code and work process.</p><p>If the task at hand is large enough, it might make sense to form a tree-like task structure, starting from the highest level of abstraction and moving down the layers until the tasks are small enough. The „small enough“ parameter depends on your particular codebase, mindset, and type of work you do, but after a bit of practice, you’ll find what granularity suits you the best.</p><p>Each task should be fairly self-sufficient and ideally shouldn’t stay in “kinda-finished” state for long (“finished but not deployed”, “finished but not reviewed”, “finished but not tested” or “finished but waiting for authorization from XYZ department”). Finished is when you don’t think about it anymore and it doesn’t drain your mental resources.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/tree.png" alt="Example of a task tree"></p><p>Do you have your own tips and tricks for organizing developer’s work?

        <p>There's a thing that comes up from time to time in the Rust community: people wanting to optimize their code. Make the code run faster. Make it allocate less memory. These are worthy goals, but maybe not necessary for all projects. Just because your program is written in Rust, it doesn't have to be optimized to the moon and back to do it's job. In a lot of cases, you'll be fine using <code>.clone()</code>.</p>
<p>There's a fantastic quote from a discussion on the <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/">Rust user forums</a> which I always think of when these discussions emerge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just because Rust allows you to write super cool non-allocating zero-copy algorithms safely, doesn't mean every algorithm you write should be super cool, zero-copy and non-allocating.<br>
-- <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/feeling-rust-is-so-difficult/29962/15">trentj on The Rust Programming Language Forum</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course there's a time and place for <em>super cool no-allocating zero-copy algorithms</em>, but very often it's not the time, nor the place. You can write fantastically effective code with Rust, but <strong>you don't have to</strong>! A lot of the time it's entirely fine to just write code that works with minimal effort. You don't have to spend 4 days trying to figure out how lifetimes work just to avoid calling <code>.clone()</code> a few times.</p>
<p>Don't spend time trying to make micro optimizations now. Take the easy route. You'll probably come back to that piece of code in a few months time, smile, and change that <code>.clone()</code> to something more efficient.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
<p><small>NB: Watch this <a href="https://youtu.be/rAl-9HwD858">video by Jon Gjengset</a> if you want a good, pragmatic walk through of lifetimes in Rust.</small></p>

        <p>A quick look at how you can configure your GitHub Actions workflows to only run when a certain phrase is present in the commit message.</p>

            <p>I'm going to be honest with you all for a second. I write a lot of <code>wip</code> commits. These commits are normally small changes that I want to push up to GitHub so that:</p>
<ol>
<li>I don't lose things if anything goes wrong and my backup hasn't picked it up.</li>
<li>If I can't describe the change I have just made.</li>
<li>If I'm demonstrating something to somebody on a pull-request.</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem is, my actions are setup to run on <code>push</code>, so every single <code>wip</code> commit gets run through the CI process, whether it be running tests, linting or formatting.</p>
<p>After doing some research, I found a way of preventing these from running on every single commit.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="yml"><span>jobs:</span>
  <span>format:</span>
    <span>runs-on:</span> <span>ubuntu-latest</span>
    <span>if:</span> <span>"! contains(github.event.head_commit.message, 'wip')"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now, whenever I push a <code>wip</code> commit or any commit that contains the word <code>wip</code>, it will be marked as skipped inside of GitHub actions.</p>
<p>You could also flip the logic and perhaps do something like:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="yml"><span>jobs:</span>
  <span>format:</span>
    <span>runs-on:</span> <span>ubuntu-latest</span>
    <span>if:</span> <span>"contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[build]')"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Any commit that contains <code>[build]</code> will now trigger these jobs, everything else will be skipped.</p>
<p>You can thank me later! 😉</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PRIME">PRIME</a> is a technology used to manage hybrid graphics. It was meant to be a resource saver since you can configure it to use only the Integrated GPU, and render offload to the dedicated GPU whenever is needed. But that is not what happened in my real life situation.</p>

<p>I was not happy with the fact that my laptop was draining a lot of battery. Not only while using render offload by running software with <code>prime-run</code> and delegating gpu stuff to my dGPU(Nvidia MX150), but using the iGPU(i915 Intel) to daily stuff(terminal, browser) was also draining a lot of battery. Overheating was also a problem and then, i started to investigate.</p>
<p>Using <code>powertop -t 3</code> shown that Firefox was draining as much as <code>800 mW</code> per process(tab) on the <code>Power Est.</code> column. Meanwhile, <code>i915</code> module was using about <code>150 mW</code> alone. That got me thinking if, using the dedicated GPU to render stuff would get it better, but it didn’t. Launching Firefox with <code>prime-run</code> reduced a little the power usage per tab (opening the same websites), but the Intel module was still draining almost the same amount of power(<code>145 mW</code>) while the <code>nvidia</code> module was using <code>35mW</code>.</p>
<p>Other thing that bugged me was that my system always started with a lot of RAM already compromissed(<code>900MB</code>) on a simple <code>i3</code> setup. Could be the case where my iGPU was already allocating a lot of that resource to itself?</p>
<p>After that, i’ve decided to try some 3D, and <a href="https://veloren.net/">Veloren</a> was the game i’ve chosen. Those were the metrics captured with my status bar and <code>powertop</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Using <code>i915</code> driver:</p>
<ul>
<li>Driver drain reached <code>400mW</code>.</li>
<li><code>1,9 GB</code> Ram used</li>
<li>Battery expected duration after full charge was <code>1:28</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using <code>nvidia</code> driver with <code>prime-run</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>i915</code> driver was still draining <code>200 mW</code> approximately, spiking to <code>400</code> sometimes.</li>
<li><code>nvidia</code> driver was using about <code>50mW</code>, spiking to <code>80</code> once in a while.</li>
<li><code>1,7 GB</code> RAM used</li>
<li>About <code>140MB</code> of GDDR used</li>
<li>Battery expected duration after full charge was <code>1:12</code>.</li>
<li>nvidia temperature reached <code>73ºC</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I know that this doesn’t seems to be a fair test, comparing a dGPU with an iGPU while executing a game. The point I was trying to prove was: Using the render offload didn’t really help on reducing resource consumption at all. On the oposite, it seems that it somehow helped me to have resources wasted by doubling energy consumption due to this binding created between modules with the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PRIME#PRIME_render_offload">render offload</a> feature.</p>

<p>I was decided to try a new approach and use <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA_Optimus#Use_NVIDIA_graphics_only">Nvidia graphics only</a>. Setup was pretty straightforward and after rebooting, I’ve launched Firefox with the same sites and <code>Power Est.</code> was about <code>570mW</code> per process. Good news, lets try Veloren again:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using <code>nvidia</code> driver only
<ul>
<li><code>nvidia</code> driver was using about <code>120mW</code>.</li>
<li>Battery expected duration after full charge was <code>1:47</code>.</li>
<li><code>1,3 GB</code> RAM used</li>
<li>About <code>140MB</code> of GDDR used</li>
<li>nvidia temperature reached <code>67ºC</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s a lot better. I also noticed that my system was using only <code>500MB</code> RAM after a fresh start(a <code>400MB</code> difference).</p>
<p><strong>Lesson learned.</strong> Try things by yourself when it comes to power management.</p>

<p>Other things changed on my system after spending the weekend optimizing energy stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not using <a href="https://github.com/tobi-wan-kenobi/bumblebee-status"><code>bumblebee-status</code></a> anymore. It’s a great bar, full of useful modules, but it was creating some weird spikes on power usage. Migrated to <a href="https://github.com/greshake/i3status-rust/"><code>i3status-rust</code></a> and now my bar isn’t even listed on the top 20 power usage agressors.
<ul>
<li>All previous tests were done using the same bar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>telegram-desktop</code> is a mess on power and cpu usage and i’m seriously thinking on ditching this software and using it’s web version only. Firefox is a software I already use so, there’s nothing to lose.</li>
<li>Try to get used with some lightweight browser like <a href="https://qutebrowser.org/">qutebrowser</a> while on battery, and stop using my bookmark sync of choice. Have to test since not having video acceleration could be a caveat.</li>
<li>Find out why while using specific softwares <code>pulseaudio</code> gets crazy and it spikes with <code>4W</code> of Power Estimated usage.</li>
</ul>

									<p>This summer, Google has been deploying its AI voice assistant called Duplex to call bars and restaurants in order to update their opening hours on Google Maps listings.<br>
Here’s a call their system had with our virtual assistant for restaurants.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/460586741" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>As far as we’re aware, this is the <strong>first naturally-occurring conversation between AI voice assistants in the wild</strong>. I have never seen anything like this before, and I’m incredibly proud that PolyAI is sharing this moment in computing history with our friends from Google.</p>
<p>After listening to the call, we’d say that it went pretty well! Google could have handled the two-part opening hours a bit better, but overall, the interaction was smooth. I want to share a few thoughts on what this means for the future of conversational technologies.</p>
<h3>Human language is a Universal API</h3>
<p>This interaction did not need to be a conversation in the way that we as humans think of it. The caller’s request was transactional and to the point. An API call or an HTTPS request between two web services would have done the job in 150ms, instead of two minutes of synthesized voice going back and forth across the telephone line. However, such APIs are not always available, or standardised. For instance, there are dozens of reservation APIs for restaurants used in the UK alone, and voice assistants will never integrate with every single one.</p>
<p>This kind of machine-to-machine conversational communication will become more commonplace as AI deployment accelerates. And while it may seem like an overkill from a technical standpoint, there are good reasons for these kinds of interactions to be conversational, rather than API calls.</p>
<p>Imagine you ask your virtual assistant — Siri or Alexa, for example — to book a hotel room. It can phone multiple hotels to check availability and book without having to integrate into each hotel’s individual booking API. And logs of the conversation can inform the user of alternative venues for their next trip.</p>
<h3>Welcome to the Uncanny Valley</h3>
<p>Google introduced <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html">Duplex in May 2018</a> as an ‘AI system for accomplishing real-world tasks over the phone’. You may have seen this video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5VN56jQMWM">Sundar Pichai at Google I/O</a> using Duplex to make a restaurant reservation.</p>
<p>I’ll be the first to point out how incredible Google’s TTS (text-to-speech) is in the Duplex/PolyAI call. It sounds like a human, much more so than our assistant does.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">Uncanny Valley theory</a>, the more human-like a robot is, the more likely people are to feel positive towards it. However, at a certain point of human-likeness, the robot becomes a bit creepy, and people are repulsed by it.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.polyai.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/uncanny-valley.png" alt="" width="588" height="387" srcset="https://www.polyai.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/uncanny-valley.png 588w, https://www.polyai.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/uncanny-valley-300x197.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px"></p>
<p>In the Google/PolyAI call, Duplex really does sound like a human – it does mention that it’s an automated service, but this is not enough. Why? Because crossing the Uncanny Valley means that a person on the call will treat the bot as though they are human.</p>
<p>Around the 1 minute mark, you’ll hear our voice assistant ask the caller when they’d like to come in, and Duplex speaks over it. In reality, these are machines – no-one’s getting offended. But when you listen to the call, the Duplex bot comes across as pretty rude. Because it sounds so human, it’s practically impossible to not attribute human qualities to the bot. And no one wants a rude voice assistant representing their company.</p>
<p><strong>Making customers think that your voice assistant is a real human is a sure-fire way to deliver frustrating customer experiences. At PolyAI, we work hard to make sure our voice assistants sit at the peak right before the Uncanny Valley – but without crossing it. Warm and friendly enough to put callers at ease, but not real enough to cause cognitive dissonance.</strong></p>
<h3>The Future of Voice</h3>
<p>Companies are wising up to the benefits of conversational AI in customer communications, and we’ll see a growing number of instances of machines communicating in human language. While this type of transactional communication may seem better suited to quick API calls, voice assistants can get the job done even when such APIs are not available.</p>
<p>We are super excited about the future of voice assistants. Two highly sophisticated voice assistants have now met in the wild, in a rerun of the legendary “Dr Livingstone, I presume” moment (though neither assistant realised they were speaking to one of their own). This is a sign of great things to come. Stay tuned – and get in touch with us if you want to build a great voice assistant for your brand.</p>

<p>I consider <a href="https://museumofzzt.com/file/c/CDZ20MOZ.ZIP" target="_blank"><i>Computer Dungeon Slash: ZZT 2.0</i></a> my personal best for ZZT games. I've now released two versions, one in September of 2019 and then another with some updates and optimizations in May of 2020. Aside from a couple of smaller errors and special-thanks additions, there's not much more to fix, so this will probably be the final version with any major changes.</p>

<p>Like some of my previous ZZT games, it relies heavily on procedural generation, with apparently such complexity that Dr. Dos called it "basically sorcery" during their <a href="https://museumofzzt.com/article/479/livestream-computer-dungeon-slash-zzt-20">playthrough on Twitch</a>, which I took as a great compliment. He also mentioned that this game, its generators in particular, could use a write-up. So I wrote one!</p>

<p><img src="https://museumofzzt.com/static/images/articles/cl/2020/cdslash/image24.png"></p>

<p>In case you're reading this and unfamiliar with this game, it concerns a player finding themselves in the town of Habeas Corpus, where almost everyone and everything has been swallowed by the dungeon.</p>

<p>The player's task is to brave the randomly-generated dungeon, rescuing the town and townspeople from its clutches.</p>

<p>There's not much more plot or lore than the above, since I focused mainly on characterization in my worldbuilding and most of the actual plot isn't revealed until the end.</p>

<p>So what about the workings of this game?</p>

<p>I'll start with "sorcery"--there's something to that, for sure. When I work with procedural generation it feels a bit like alchemy. Scientific, but also a little bit mysterious and magical. I hope this article helps you better understand the scientific side of that coin.</p>

<p>For readers not intimately familiar with ZZT, one reason a veteran ZZTer would call my level generation "sorcery"  is its limitations. ZZT is a 1991 DOS game-creation-system, after all, simple enough for 8-year-old me to use. So if you don't know anything about ZZT coming in, I hope this write-up helps you better understand the absurdity and appeal of working in it and pushing its limits.</p>

<p>Further, if you came into this wanting to know how this stuff works so that you can experiment with it or even improve on it, I want you to be empowered to do so.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>With <i>Computer Dungeon Slash: ZZT</i> (called <i>CDZ</i> here for short) I had three goals for generation. I wanted levels to be interesting to look at, fun to play, and fair. What does fair mean?</p>

<p>Most previous ZZT releases with procedural generation would probably not soft-lock players (block them off from finishing the game). In the early 2000s when this fad hit, most ZZTers involved were in high school and "probably not" was enough. But that small chance of soft-locking players with my generators annoyed me even then.</p>

<p>With <i>CDZ</i>, I wanted some certainty that my algorithms absolutely would not soft-lock players.</p>

<p>With these goals in mind, let's look at the tools I had to accomplish them.</p>

<h2>Building Blocks for Procedural Level Generation in ZZT</h2>

<p>ZZT is tile-based, so making it create its own levels is kind of like generating dungeons for classic ASCII roguelikes, except with much more restrictive tools and limits than, for example, C++ or Python. There's no way to easily store level layout data outside of "in the level", and ZZT boasts precious few variables and only ten true-or-false flags. In addition, the entire game is made up of "boards" of only 60x25 tiles! Despite being such a limited system, ZZT lets us do a fair amount.</p>

<p><img src="https://museumofzzt.com/static/images/articles/cl/2020/cdslash/image4.png">
<img src="https://museumofzzt.com/static/images/articles/cl/2020/cdslash/image7.gif"></p>

<p>Almost any element (terrain or other object) that takes up a space on a board is helpful, but a few basic ones are laid out in a reference image on the left. Fake walls prove pretty invaluable because they don't block objects but help the engine easily keep track of where another terrain type <i>will</i> later appear.</p>

<p>While <i>CDZ</i> uses sliders and boulders to some extent, the classic examples of ZZT level generators using sliders and boulders are probably WiL's <i>Run-On</i> and Benco's <i>Lost</i>.</p>

<p>And of course, one of the elements of play is actually <i>called</i> an object, and can run little scripts in ZZT-OOP, the engine's default "language." ZZT-OOP has a number of helpful commands for procedural generation.</p>

<p>The <code>#change</code> command can change almost any ZZT gameplay element into almost any other, which is invaluable both for structuring and theming levels. <code>#put THING DIRECTION</code> and <code>#become THING</code> allow for level builder objects to modify environments directly, and they have a more complex use we'll go into later.</p>

<p>Procedural level generation in <i>CDZ</i> is random. Appropriately, ZZT-OOP's random directions proved immensely useful in making it happen. A number of situations call for a "four-sided" dice-roll, and ZZT does have an <i>rnd</i> direction (randomly north, south, east, or west), but as the reader may know, <i>rnd</i> is twice as likely to give an east-west result as a north-south. So what to do?</p>

<p>Well, there are also <i>rndne</i> (north or east) and <i>rndp DIRECTION</i> (one of two directions perpendicular to <i>DIRECTION</i>). Because <i>rndne</i> is a valid direction in itself, you can use <i>rndp rndne</i> to get a random cardinal direction with equal probability of each. (I'm ashamed that I didn't realize that one until reading Anna Anthropy's <i>ZZT</i> a few years back.)</p>

<p><img src="https://museumofzzt.com/static/images/articles/cl/2020/cdslash/image14.gif"></p>

<p>In ZZT, <code>#if blocked DIRECTION</code> tells an object whether it is blocked in a given direction. And <code>#send OBJECTNAME:LABEL</code> tells another object, <i>OBJECTNAME</i>, to immediately begin executing code starting with <i>:LABEL</i>.</p>

<p>Slime enemies move erratically and leave breakable walls behind, so you can change their color frequently to fill empty spaces with different colors of breakable walls.</p>

<p>One last limitation and one last "coding" trick deserves mention. ZZT has a limit of about 20 kilobytes per board (including code) before the board misbehaves or gets corrupted at runtime. Objects can use the command <code>#bind OBJECTNAME</code> to work from the same exact instance of the same code as the other object <i>OBJECTNAME</i>, saving valuable code space.</p>

<p>Nowadays, one can "pre-bind" objects with external editors, causing them to share identical labels and behaviors but eliminating the need for the 5+ bytes of space that a <code>#bind</code> command needs.</p>

<h2>Two Big Insights</h2>

<p><img src="https://museumofzzt.com/static/images/articles/cl/2020/cdslash/image18.png">
<img src="https://museumofzzt.com/static/images/articles/cl/2020/cdslash/image20.png"></p>

<p>In addition to the more concrete "tools" above, two big conceptual insights greatly impacted this project. The first is about level connectedness, and it hit me after reading Rabbitboots's musings on house generation in <a href="https://museumofzzt.com/file/d/dood2018.zip" target="_blank"><i>Doodads 2018</i></a>.</p>

<p>Say I have a house with four rooms, and I block off only one doorway in the house, as on the left. Any room in the house can still visit any other.</p>

<p>Rabbitboots goes on to note that if we make a larger house out of smaller ones, the large house remains fully connected.</p>

<p>If House A connects to House B and B connects to House C, then A connects to C.</p>

<p>This was huge for me. It gave me hope that I could avoid soft-locks while also making more interesting, varied levels.</p>

<p>Shortly after the 2019 release, while looking at TriphEd's maze generation in <a href="https://museumofzzt.com/file/b/BACKTRAX.zip" target="_blank"><i>Backtrax</i></a>, I had another "Aha!" moment.</p>


<p>The algorithm is best explained step-by-step, and you can follow along with the following roughly equivalent method if you have a pencil and paper.</p>

<p>(1) Start with a grid of dots. Any size 3 x 3 or up will do.</p>

<p>(2) Connect all the outer dots along the edge so that they make a rectangle.</p>

<p>(3) For each "middle dot" within the square, draw <i>exactly one line</i> from that dot to any dot directly above, below, left, or right of it. Edge dots can receive lines.</p>

<p>If you used a 3 x 3 grid of dots, the end result will resemble the 2 x 2 house above.</p>

<p><img src="https://museumofzzt.com/static/images/articles/cl/2020/cdslash/backtrax-levels.gif"></p>

<p>Any edge tile can access any other edge tile in this algorithm. It can leave some squares inaccessible from the edges, but this is acceptable if nothing essential to player progress is placed in those tiles.</p>

<p>In ZZT, you can accomplish this by having objects use <code>#put rndp rndne ELEMENT</code> on a grid, and that's exactly what <i>Backtrax</i> is doing.</p>

<p>A <i>very</i> small set of soft-lock possibilities does exist in <i>Backtrax</i>. Because there's a blocking linewall diagonally southeast of the lower-right-hand wall generator object, the wrong combinations of walls <i>could</i> block the player, but it is <i>incredibly</i> unlikely and easily remedied.</p>

<p>This is the most elegant level generator in ZZT to date--and also, in case it wasn't already elegant enough, it weighs in at only 10.9 kilobytes and re-uses its "grid" after you reach the exit, using a separate trick (that I won't discuss in detail here) to teleport the player back to the start for a new level.</p>

<p>Recognize TriphEd's genius.</p>

<p>After the initial <i>CDZ</i> release, I experimented a lot with this algorithm. Several generators in version 2.0 benefited from its use. We can now move slowly but surely into the actual inner workings of this game.</p>

<h2>Primary Generators</h2>

<p><img src="https://museumofzzt.com/static/images/articles/cl/2020/cdslash/image6.png"></p>

<p><i>Computer Dungeon Slash</i> level generators have a "primary generator" object that handles a lot of needed dice-rolls and uses <code>#send</code> to communicate its randomization to different groups of objects. It's usually set up as on the left, or similar.</p>

<p>This particular setup involves fake walls placed north, south, east, and west of the primary generator and water (a blocking terrain) in the four corners. To make a four-direction roll, it uses <code>#put rndp rndne gem</code> and then iterates over some variation of:</p>

<code>#if blocked n #send object:option1
#if blocked e #send object:option2
#if blocked s #send object:option3
#if blocked w #send object:option4</code>

<p><img src="https://museumofzzt.com/static/images/articles/cl/2020/cdslash/image16.png"></p>

<p>The objects referred to in the <code>#send object:option</code> commands  are pre-bound objects with exactly the same code, and positioned so that only one of them will place a wall, generate an important key, etc. at the time they're called. In this example, the pre-bound group of objects has this code:</p><p>

<code>@object
#cycle 1
#end
:option1
#if blocked n become solid
#die
:option2
#if blocked e become solid
#die
:option3
#if blocked s become solid
#die
:option4
#if blocked w become solid
#die</code></p><p>There is a fake wall in the middle of the house, so that only one object becomes a wall, and the rest die. Then the primary generator turns the fake into a solid wall.</p>

<p><img src="https://museumofzzt.com/static/images/articles/cl/2020/cdslash/image23.gif"></p>

<p>This method also extends to larger houses similar to those in the <i>Doodads 2018</i> example, and can …</p></article></div>

    <p>OTTAWA -- 	Twenty-one Ontario doctors have signed a joint letter to Premier Doug Ford, urging him not to issue a new lockdown this fall because of rising COVID-19 case numbers.</p><p>	Daily numbers of new cases have risen dramatically in recent days, with Ontario recording <a href="https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/new-covid-19-cases-in-ontario-reach-highest-mark-ever-1.5122863" target="_blank">700 new cases of COVID-19 on Monday</a> – the highest number of new cases recorded in a single day.</p><p>	However, the 21 doctors who signed the letter to the premier say another provincewide lockdown—similar to what was in place in the spring—would not be helpful.</p><ul>	<li>		<a href="#Full letter"><i>Read the full letter below</i></a></li></ul><p>	"We are writing this letter in support of the governments’ plan to use a tactical localized approach, rather than sweeping new lockdown measures, to deal with the increasing COVID case numbers in Ontario," the letter says.&nbsp;</p><p>	"Lockdowns have been shown not to eliminate the virus. While they slow the spread of the virus, this only lasts as long as the lockdown lasts. This creates a situation where there is no way to end the lockdown, and society cannot move forward in vitally important ways including in the health sector, the economy and other critically important instrumental goods including education, recreation, and healthy human social interactions."</p><p>	Speaking on Newstalk 580 CFRA's "The Morning Rush with Bill Carroll" in Ottawa, CTV's infectious disease specialist Dr. Neil Rau—a signatory of the letter—pointed to two data points to consider when looking at the spread of COVID-19.</p><p>	"We're reacting to increased aggregate case numbers, but the percentage positive is not really as bad as it used to be," he said. "We're testing more people, so we're finding more cases […] We're driving our numbers up, it's worse than it was in the summer, but it's not what it was last winter and life has to go on."</p><ul>	<li>		<a href="https://www.iheartradio.ca/580-cfra/podcasts/the-morning-rush-dr-neil-rau-interview-why-we-don-t-want-another-lockdown-1.13612912?mode=Article" target="_blank"><strong>LISTEN NOW: "The Morning Rush": Dr. Neil Rau - Why we don't want another lockdown</strong></a></li></ul><p>	Monday's 700 cases in Ontario came from 41,111 total tests, for a positive percentage rate of 1.7 per cent. On April 24, <a href="https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/highest-number-of-new-covid-19-cases-in-a-single-day-reported-by-ontario-health-officials-1.4910216" target="_blank">the previous watermark of 640 new cases in a single day</a>, the result came from 12,295 tests, for a positive percentage rate of 5.2 per cent.</p><p>	Testing capacity was lower in the spring than it is now, and testing criteria has changed over time; however, Dr. Rau and the other signatories of the letter said the increasing case numbers are not leading to unmanageable levels of hospitalizations.</p><p>	"In Ontario and other parts of the world, such as the European Union, increasing case loads are not necessarily translating into unmanageable levels of hospitalizations and ICU admissions," the letter says.</p><p>	The letter also points to other health impacts linked to the lockdown.</p><p>	"Hard data now exist showing the significant negative health effects shutting down society has caused. Overdoses have risen 40% in some jurisdictions. Extensive morbidity has been experienced by those whose surgery has been cancelled, and the ramifications for cancer patients whose diagnostic testing was delayed has yet to be determined," the letter states.</p><p>	"Economic harms are health harms," Dr. Rau told CFRA. "It sounds horrible to say, but it's true. Health is wealth. We all know this."</p><h2>	<strong>LETTER POINTS TO DISAGREEMENT AMONG HEALTH PROFESSIONALS</strong></h2><p>	Other Ontario health professionals have been arguing for increased restrictions as cases rise.</p><p>	Last week, the Ontario Hospital Association released a letter signed by 38 health professionals which <a href="https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/ontario-hospital-association-calls-for-return-to-restrictions-on-non-essential-businesses-1.5119832" target="_blank">called for immediate restrictions to be re-imposed on non-essential businesses</a>, such as gyms, dine-in restaurants and bars, nightclubs, and theatres. It also calls on restrictions on other places where people can gather, such as places of worship.</p><p>	The letter from the OHA said regions where the speed of transmission was underestimated are “now facing the consequence of increased hospitalization rates, including a rise in intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and more deaths.”</p><p>	Hospitalizations in Ontario have been increasing, but have not yet reached the same level that was seen in the spring.</p><p>	According to <a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/data" target="_blank">data from the Ontario government</a>, there were 128 people in hospital in Ontario with COVID-19 complications on Monday—the day 700 new cases were recorded—up from 65 a week before; however, on April 24—when 640 new cases were recorded—government data shows that there were 910 people in hospital. The peak for hospitalizations in Ontario came in May, when there were days when more than 1,000 people were hospitalized. That number steadily decreased from May through the summer before it began going up again in September.</p><p>	Speaking on CTV Morning Live Ottawa, infectious disease specialist Dr. Abdu Sharkawy suggested t<a href="https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=2045684" target="_blank">emporary restrictions on gathering would help curb the spread of COVID-19</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>	"We don't want to see our hospitals overwhelmed," he said. "We're still waiting for flu season and a whole bunch of other respiratory viruses to hit us and our capacity to be challenged. We don't want that to happen. We need everybody to try and simplify their lives and minimize anything that's non-essential."</p><p>	Dr. Sharkawy said regions where cases are rapidly rising may need to impose new restrictions to get the spread of the virus under control.</p><p>	"I think it's abundantly clear that, particularly in hot spots like Ottawa, Toronto and Peel region, the situation is not well controlled," he said. "Sometimes you need blunt instruments, even if they're temporary in nature, to make sure that you curtail the spread of this virus because it gets away from us a lot more quickly than many of us can anticipate sometimes."</p><p>	Dr. Sharkawy suggested hot spots follow the lead of Quebec, which imposed <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/life-in-the-red-zone-here-s-what-you-can-and-can-t-do-1.5125093" target="_blank">harsh restrictions on three areas in the province</a>, including Montreal and Quebec City, banning private gatherings and closing bars and restaurant dining rooms.</p><p>	"I think we should do it now," Dr. Sharkawy said of Ontario. "I think we all need to adopt an attitude and an approach that recognizes that we have to do what's absolutely necessary to keep everybody safe."</p><h2>	<strong>FULL LETTER FROM ONTARIO DOCTORS TO THE PREMIER</strong></h2><p>	Dear Premier Ford,</p><p>	We are writing this letter in support of the governments’ plan to use a tactical localized approach, rather than sweeping new lockdown measures, to deal with the increasing COVID case numbers in Ontario. Lockdowns have been shown not to eliminate the virus. While they slow the spread of the virus, this only lasts as long as the lockdown lasts. This creates a situation where there is no way to end the lockdown, and society cannot move forward in vitally important ways including in the health sector, the economy and other critically important instrumental goods including education, recreation, and healthy human social interactions.</p><p>	In Ontario the increase in cases at this time are in people under 60 years of age who are unlikely to become very ill. At the peak of the pandemic in Ontario in mid-April, 56% of cases were in ≥60 year olds, now in Sept only 14% of cases are in ≥60 year olds. In Ontario and other parts of the world, such as the European Union, increasing case loads are not necessarily translating into unmanageable levels of hospitalizations and ICU admissions. This is not a result of a lag in reporting of severe and fatal cases. While we understand the concerns that these cases could spill into vulnerable communities, we also need to balance the actual risk. As the virus circulates at manageable levels within the community, we need to continue the gains we have made in the protection of the vulnerable in long-term care and retirement institutions, and continue to educate other people about their individual risk, so that they can observe appropriate protective measures.</p><p>	Lockdowns have costs that have, to this point, not been included in the consideration of further measures. A full accounting of the implications on health and well-being must be included in the models, and be brought forward for public debate. Hard data now exist showing the significant negative health effects shutting down society has caused. Overdoses have risen 40% in some jurisdictions. Extensive morbidity has been experienced by those whose surgery has been cancelled, and the ramifications for cancer patients whose diagnostic testing was delayed has yet to be determined. A huge concern is the implication of closure of schools, and the ongoing reluctance we have seen in the large urban centers of sending children back to the classroom due to safety concerns. Global data clearly now show that children have an extremely low risk of serious illness, but they are disproportionately harmed by precautions. Children’s rights to societal care, mental health support and education must be protected. This cannot be achieved with ongoing or rotating lockdown.</p><p>	The invitation and involvement of other health experts to advise the government’s response beside individuals in Public Health and Infectious Diseases in addition to leaders in the business, securities and arts communities is essential. We also call for increased open debate, in the public forum, that hears voices from outside the medical and public health communities, in order to consider all points of view from society. This is a fundamental principle upon which democratic societies are built. All stakeholders should have an equal right to participation in public discourse when it comes to setting such fundamental and sweeping societal interventions.</p><p>	All have the right to feel their voices have been heard, and moreover to ensure factual credible data is openly debated, in contrast to the personal and political slants that have had apparent significant impacts on the management of the virus to date. Our society has borne enormous pain over the past 6 months. It’s time to do something different.</p><p>	Sincerely,</p><p>	Jane Batt MD, PhD, FRCPC.

We gave him a tour of Blokable’s prototype factory in Vancouver, Wash., and shared our R&amp;D work to reimagine how housing is built.

For each participant in the process, the singular goal is to extract a profit from that specific patch of dirt, and their profits are circumscribed by the value of the land, the applicable building regulations, and the prevailing labor and capital costs.&nbsp;</p><p>The result of this one-off approach is soaring project costs that make housing simply unaffordable to most people in many parts of the U.S.. Conventional housing development is like building a snowflake every time. And if the glut of empty luxury condo towers in downtown San Francisco is any indication, many of these snowflake projects are indeed melting as soon as they touch the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>How did this one-off approach to development take shape? Everything from ovens to stereos were all once clunky prototypes built as one-offs in the same location as their eventual use. Over time with innovation, standardization, and market demand, they evolved into products. In the early days of the automobile and aviation industries, prototypes and projects were built at high cost and yielded low quality results that resembled the current market products in their most basic functionality: they could drive and fly. Early automobile and airplane prototypes were unsafe and expensive. But through investment in product design, engineering, prototyping, and manufacturing, these prototypes eventually evolved into products. Increasingly stable designs and specifications enabled greater standardization, repeatability, and mass production resulting in lower costs, higher quality, and broader distribution.&nbsp;</p><p>Coupled with clear market demand, this standardization led to the formation of entire industries to build roads and airports, manufacture tires, test safety under federal guidelines, and so on. If you visit the automotive and aviation manufacturing hubs around Detroit and Seattle you’ll find vibrant supply chains competing for business and investing in innovation to provide better products and services. Continuously improving engines, seats, windshields, and bathrooms. All of this activity creates ever-improving products and fierce competition for performance, quality, and price.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If we compare product manufacturing in the automotive and aviation industries to how we build housing — whether it is an Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU), single family home, multi-family apartment building, or a high rise — the steps in the process are largely the same. To simplify the housing development process, let’s assume the land is entitled, there are no environmental mitigation issues, financing is secured, and development will not be opposed by regulatory agencies or local city council. What does it take to build a snowflake?</p><figure><img width="1200" height="800" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMjA0OCAxMzY0IiB3aWR0aD0iMjA0OCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMzY0IiBkYXRhLXU9IiUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAyMCUyRjA5JTJGQmxvZy0yLWJvZHktaW1hZ2UtMjA0OHgxMzY0LmpwZyIgZGF0YS13PSIyMDQ4IiBkYXRhLWg9IjEzNjQiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+" data-spai="1" alt="Housing creation is an endless series of one-offs" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"><figcaption><em>Conventional housing development is like building a snowflake every time.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Let’s look at the absolute bare minimum of steps in the process from the perspective of the developer. Broadly speaking, the developer identifies and ties up the site, conducts preliminary site review and discussions with impacted parties, manages entitlements, financing, and the project approval process for the site, oversees all building and owns the project along with any equity investors they have brought in to finance the deal. With respect to the building process itself, the developer will partner with an architect to work up a site massing and design that will satisfy the intended program — the mix of units, floorplans, common spaces, revenue generating and non-revenue generating space — as well as the code requirements for the building and the site. Once the basic architecture is in place, the project heads over to engineers, which are typically separate firms with separate contracts, costs, regulatory oversight, and liability, to specify structural engineering, MEP (mechanical, electrical, plumbing), and site and offsite engineering.&nbsp;</p><p>With the initial design and engineering complete, the developer sends a construction set of drawings to a general contractor (GC) for final pricing. The GC will take the specifications and build out a schedule and budget to determine how much work they intend to do themselves (self-perform) vs. how much work they will contract out to sub-contractors (subs). The GC will oversee all of the work necessary to build this custom-designed and engineered project on-site, including civil, foundation, pulling utilities, framing, rough-in and waterproofing, siding and cladding, roofing, windows and doors, MEP, paint and trim, fixtures and finishes, and ultimately certificate of occupancy.&nbsp; It is important to note that at this stage the GC’s quote is just an estimate. We haven’t built anything yet.</p><p>With approved drawings, financing, budget, and schedule in hand, the developer can start the snowflake build. Every step listed in the paragraph above must be completed by the corresponding specialists, and getting the work done on schedule is much more of an art than a science. Each contractor and subcontractor has their own contractual obligations, risks, and liability. Getting to the certificate of occupancy means the developer has navigated the process and can now bring in buyers or renters to start paying off the decades of debt that were secured to finance the build.&nbsp; When the developer moves on to the next project, all of the steps must be performed again, without exception. The finished project may be beautiful, energy efficient, or last 100 years, but it will still be a one-off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All of this work is done for every project every time, regardless of size. A home or apartment is not more complicated than a car or plane, and while the unique attributes of individual sites and real estate do add challenges to repeatability, it is possible to decouple the building from the dirt.</p><p>We can’t be surprised that building costs for new housing continue to escalate. We can’t be surprised that it’s even more expensive to create affordable housing. Yet we continue to shrug our shoulders and say, “That’s just how it is.” We dig around the edges of the problem, foraging for scraps by looking for cost savings in commodities, underpaying labor, cutting corners on quality and performance, and building on cheaper land further and further from work and community.&nbsp;</p><p>Housing development is antiquated and the only group benefitting is the real estate development and building industry, who in fact have every incentive to restrict the supply. We’re making Version 1 of the oven, stereo, car, and plane over and over again, in a housing market that is chronically under-served. The failure to build adequate housing has generational effects on health, education, and opportunity.&nbsp;</p><p>There has to be a better way. We have to re-imagine the housing market and build better. More on that to come in our next post.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<li><strong>The&nbsp;Metropolitan Transportation Commission approved a plan that would require Bay Area residents to work from home three days a week&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong>The proposal, which was voted on Wednesday, would ensure that sizable, office-based companies keep 60 per cent of their workers home</strong></li>
<li><strong>&nbsp;Transportation officials hope it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb climate change in the area</strong></li>
<li><strong>Some residents and workers opposed the plan by noting that working remotely is not ideal for many people</strong></li>
<li><b>Big Tech companies in Bay Area have already transitioned much of their operations online and some have made remote work a permanent feature&nbsp;</b></li>
<li>
<p>A new proposal could require Californians to work remotely three days a week – even after the COVID-19 pandemic – to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to aid in environmental efforts.</p>
<p>A number of Bay Area residents, including employees at large tech firms, were concerned over a new proposal approved by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission on Wednesday.</p>
 <!-- A generated by theme --> 



 <!-- end A --> 


<p>The controversial proposal would effectively ensure that sizable, office-based companies kept 60 per cent of their workers at home on any given workday to curb</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘Given the changes in travel patterns during the&nbsp;<a id="mol-ecbfd540-000a-11eb-af1a-6fc9d77b8f42" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/coronavirus/index.html">coronavirus</a>&nbsp;pandemic, there was strong support for bolder policies on this front in the Final Blueprint, including a mandate for office-based employers,’ the proposal read.</p>
<p>‘To ensure this strategy achieves equity goals, a complementary strategy to expand internet access in underserved communities was added to the Economy Element as well.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This latest proposal underscores a larger shift towards remote work that became commonplace after the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States in January.</p>
<p>By March, entire office buildings shuttered and industries stumbled as employers struggled to transfer in-person operations to out of the workplace.</p>
<p>But now, six months later, city officials and some employers viewed the forced transition as a unrealized benefit that could reshape office culture and transportation.</p>
<p>‘There is an opportunity to do things that could not have been done in the past,’ said&nbsp;Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, a commission member and proposal supporter,</p>
</li>
<li><img loading="lazy" src="https://usatodaysun.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/b-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="524" height="349" srcset="https://usatodaysun.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/b-300x200.jpg 300w, https://usatodaysun.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/b.jpg 634w" sizes="(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px"></li>
<li>
<p>A May 2020 study from the&nbsp;Nature Climate Change Journal&nbsp;noted that daily carbon dioxide emissions plunged by 17 per cent in the United States during April.</p>
<p>‘The estimated decrease in daily fossil CO2&nbsp;emissions from the severe and forced confinement of world populations of –17% (–11 to –25%) at its peak are extreme and probably unseen before,’ the study said.</p>
<p>The commission’s proposal was found inside a larger policy package titled ‘Plan Bay Area 2050 Final Blueprint,’ in which officials theorized what the Bay Area could look like in 30 years and what could be done about reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Members voted 11-1 to approve the overall policy package, including the mandate.</p>
<p>Bay Area is home to Silicon Valley, the central hub of Big Tech firms that have taken different approaches to working from home.</p>
<p>Facebook quickly embraced remote working as a longterm plan&nbsp;and advised its 50,000 staffers to work from home to avoid spreading the coronavirus.</p>
<p>CEO Mark Zuckerberg later announced that the company had extended its work-from-home plan until 2021, allowing employees to avoid the Menlo Park office for the next several months.</p>
<p>Similarly, Twitter, which reported 5,100 employees in its most recent earnings report, ordered employees to work from home .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was later revealed by CEO Jack Dorsey that the company will allow most of its employees to work from home permanently.</p>
<p>‘Opening offices will be our decision. When and if our employees come back, will be theirs,’ a spokesperson for the company said.</p>
<p>But companies like Apple, that have invested loads of money on its campuses and facilities, have been less eager to fully welcome remote work.</p>
<p>Tim Cook revealed in a recent interview at The Atlantic Festival that he hoped employees would be back in the office by next year and pointed out that remote work doesn’t allow for certain employee interactions.</p>
<p>When word of the plan reached Bay Area residents, many were concerned and logged onto the virtual commission meeting on Wednesday to object.</p>
<p>‘We do not want to continue this as a lifestyle,’ said&nbsp;Steven Buss, a Google software engineer who lives in San Francisco, according to NBC News.</p>
<p>‘We are all sacrificing now to reduce the spread of the virus, but no one is enjoying working from home.</p>
<p>‘It’s probably fine if you own a big house out in the suburbs and you’re nearing retirement, but for young workers like me who live in crowded conditions, working from home is terrible.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some residents noted that the strategy enforces workplace inequality since some jobs cannot be performed at home, while others worried about the effects it would have on other industries as a result.</p>
<p>Stacey Randecker called into the meeting on Wednesday and questioned why the proposal included all commute alternatives if the main focus was on car emissions.</p>
<p>‘Yes, yes, yes, we want to reduce greenhouse gases, but why aren’t you considering transit? Walking? Biking?’ she said.</p>
<p>Duston Moskovitz, co-founder of Facebook, shared the sentiments on Twitter.</p>
<p>‘We tried nothing, and we’re all out of ideas,’ he wrote on Tuesday.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commission member Nick Josefowitz said the work-from-home proposal was a late addition into the policy package.</p>
<p>NBC News reports that&nbsp;Josefowitz attempted to amend the proposal to allow transit and walking from home as alternatives, but critics worried that a delay could result in the commission missing emission reduction targets and an important funding deadline.</p>
<p>‘If we start amending this plan at this late hour, do you have any rabbits in your hat that’s going to get us to the finish line,’ asked commission member&nbsp;Jim Spering.</p>
<p>The proposal added that the work-from-home strategy ‘was not included in the Draft Blueprint and was added based upon public feedback this summer.’</p>
<p>MTC executive director Therese McMillan said there would be opportunities to later go over the strategy’s details and include alternative transportation.</p>
<p>The commission will meet against before the end of the year and then it would need to be implemented over time.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-74174200445ef6e30546"><div><p>This blog post is very late. It’s well over a year since<a href="https://twitter.com/colmmacc/status/1153727018896244736"> I posted a coding challenge on twitter</a>. The idea was simple, I’ve always felt that code readability is undervalued so I figured I’d put cold hard cash up. I announced a $1,000 pot, divided into $500, $300, and $200 prizes for the most readable implementations of <a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2019/06/06/nearly-divisionless-random-integer-generation-on-various-systems/">Daniel Lemire’s nearly divisionless algorithm for selecting a random number from an interval.</a> I now have winners to announce and congratulate, and they’re in this blog post, but there’s more to this story.</p><p>I didn’t know it at the time but I’d end up reviewing the entries with colleagues to see if they could follow what was happening (spoiler: they couldn’t). When people got stuck, we’d whiteboard&nbsp;our way through so that we could better understand why and where people were getting stuck. Oh, to be able to whiteboard in person again!  </p><p>I learned a lot about how people think through problems, and that process led to me writing a seperate implementation of Lemire’s Algorithm, with a twenty-to-one comment to code ratio (that’s a lot of comments), and finding a sort-of security issue with the algorithm in the process. I say “sort of” because you really have a ridiculously enormous struggle to find a case where it’s going to be practical to exploit. But it still surprised me, and you probably can’t use Lemire’s algorithm in Vegas.</p><h4>Why Lemire’s Algorithm?</h4><p>I chose Lemire’s algorithm because it is brilliant. When I read Lemire’s code I get that kind of brain-tingling and gawk at the sheer “How on earth did someone think of this” of it all. Lemire has a mastery of code and how code is executed, and then pairs that with transcendent creativity and concision.  Lemire also writes well, and the papers that accompany his code and algorithms are easily some of the most cogent and approachable you’ll find in academia. They are short and clear and avoid the jargon and obtuseness that plagues the field, while containing just enough formalism to be rigorous.</p><p>Lemire’s algorithm is a solution to the problem “Give me a random number between 0 and N, not including N itself”. For simulating a dice, N would be 6 and you’d get back either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 with equal probability. Computers like to start at zero. We can always add one to the result to get the familiar results you’d get on a real dice. I’ve worked on random number generators and written quite a few. In 20 years of doing that, I’d never come across a solution as cool as Lemire’s.</p><p>Before Lemire, the best-known solutions to this problem required one or two divisions per number generated. You probably learned long division when you were quite young. You may remember that it can be get pretty tedious and cumbersome. It’s the same for computers. Division is actually one of the slowest things we can ask a computer to do. Lemire avoids division by translating numbers into a much larger number “space” and using binary-friendly powers-of-two operations instead. His technique almost always avoids needing a division.</p><p>The second reason I chose Lemire’s algorithm is that it is impenetrable upon first reading. There are lucky few people who are so practiced and conversant in number manipulation that they can see inside of algorithms like Neo in the matrix, but I don’t mean them. To the average reader, myself included, it’s not clear what’s going on and why.</p><p>Lemire’s reference code is fourteen lines long, like a sonnet. Twelve of the lines are simple, and any proficient programmer could tell <em>what</em> they are doing. Two specific lines of the code are pretty hard to decipher.. But the real difficulty is how hard it is to understand <em>why</em> all 14 lines are doing what they are doing, and <em>why</em> it results in a fair and correct algorithm for choosing a random number.</p><div><p>As a case in point, if you read the comments to Lemire’s blog, you’ll find several misunderstandings of the code. That’s within an audience of primed Lemire fans and critics who are familiar with the field. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10941">Lemire’s accompanying paper</a> is great and very readable, but it still takes effort and concentration to follow everything. I work on cryptography and write cryptographic code for a living and I’m not ashamed to tell you it took me about 3 readings to really get it. The algorithm is based on an interaction between two modular spaces, one of which is sized 2 to power of 64, and the other is “N” sized, and if I just totally lost you there, I beg forgiveness and if you bear with me I promise there’s a link to my detailed dissection of how and why everything works. </p><p>All of this makes Lemire’s algorithm a really good challenge for creating a more readable version. Ideally something that an average coder can read in one pass, understand, and agree that it’s correct. </p></div><h4>Why does readability matter?</h4><p>Code readability is the most important pillar of code correctness and maintainability. When code is unreadable, it is harder to spot errors. That’s true when you’re doing a code review and it’s even more true when you’re adding more code to an existing code base. Great testing can compensate for some of the correctness challenges, but it doesn’t do as much for maintainability. </p><p>In s2n, one of our <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/s2n/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md">development principles</a> is to write clear readable code with a light cognitive load. We’re serious about it, and I wasn’t going to try and use Lemire’s algorithm in s2n without a very readable implementation.</p><p>Working in software development I’ve heard the opinion more than once about how programmers and coders should be more familiar with the fundamental mathematics of logic and number theory that underpin their field, and that academic style papers and explanations should be sufficient. I happen to work with teams that are made up of both expert coders and expert mathematicians, and even there I don’t think this is a good idea.</p><p>Software engineering is engineering, which means translating science into solutions that work in the real world.  To wildly generalize, there are better dividends to be found in focusing on deepening ones understanding of the “real world” part of that, the users, the customers, the business models, usability, ergonomics, and so on, than on the “science” part of that. Some science is needed, but there’s a shallow limit. Just as a civil engineer doesn’t need too detailed an understanding of the chemistry of concrete. PHs and setting times, but not quantum numbers.</p><p>Code should be self-documenting. The average programmer, including someone straight out of college, should be able to understand and work on a well put-together codebase. This greatly improves the odds of finding problems, and that’s what matters. </p><h4>The contest</h4><p>One of the reasons I’ve been so tardy about this blog post is that the contest didn’t go as I’d expected. </p><p>Let’s start with the great thing that happened. I got several submissions, more than enough to pick winners from. Many of these submissions are good and do improve upon Lemire’s code. The most common improvement was to use more descriptive names for the variables. Lemire uses variable names such as “s”, “t”, “l” which seemingly don’t correspond to much. In such a short piece of code, this actually isn’t too big an offense. I kept these terms in my own implementation, because I want to be consistent with the paper, but it’s absolutely a valid improvement. Another great improvement is to write and include tests, which is really an essential part of software development. </p><p>The first place <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/98183e47436699f6e5eab200061c46eec342806e/std/rand.zig#L74-L118">winner</a> did both of these, and also cleared up some of the confusing lines of code by making an implicit truncation explicit. According to GitHub the winner had 5 contributors, but twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/komu_wairagu/status/1161643573223317504">komu_wairagu</a> submitted it, so that’s who I’ll be contacting to Venmo $500.</p><p>The second place <a href="https://github.com/nimia/Lemire_RNG">winner</a> comes from <a href="https://twitter.com/NimrodAviram">Nimrod Aviram</a>, who I know professionally as the discoverer of the DROWN vulnerability and fun person to hang out with at RealWorldCrypto. Nimrod’s implementation includes some great testing too.</p><p>The third place winner wants to stay anonymous, and cheated their way to some bonus points by writing a great implementation in LISP. How can you not love that? If they change their minds about anonymity I’ll update this post with a link. The sha256 checksum of their implementation is ae008644b2f0b10eddbbce3a0508b103b19925e4e0c9354c569ff0816acb760c. </p><p>Now on to the not as great, and one of the reasons I’ve taken this long to write. It doesn’t feel right to criticize any of these efforts, made in spare time and as part of a fun challenge I put out there, but none of them actually explained Lemire’s algorithm or broke down how and why it worked. I asked several colleagues to look through these implementations and tell me if they understood what was going on, and the response was a uniform zero. Noone could fully understand even one of the implementations, or Lemire’s original.  When I asked people to also read the paper, things got a bit better, but everyone still seemed to trip on some issues.  These are smart people who absolutely know what they are doing. I’m sure given more time they could fully understand everything, but that wasn’t the goal. The goal was to have understanding after one or two, or at most just a few, readings.</p><h4>What did people find hard to follow?</h4><p>Talking through things with people I found some common problems. Some directly in the code, and others in the paper. The first line of code that threw people was:</p><pre><code>uint64_t l = ( uint64_t ) m;</code></pre><p>This line of code does an unusual operation called truncation. It takes a 128-bit value “m” and truncates that to its least significant 64-bits. All of this is implicit in the code, rather than explicit. Reading the code, you have to recall that m is 128-bits. Then there’s also the question of why are we doing this truncation? I’ll leave that for a minute. </p><p>The next problematic line of code was:</p><pre><code>uint64_t t = -s % s;</code></pre><p>This line of code is using an unusual combination of unary negation, on an unsigned int, and the modulus operator.  Nobody remembers what unary negation does to an unsigned int - and why should they …</p></div></div></div>

	<p>Netflix has finally made its 4K Ultra HD content available to stream on Mac, albeit not everyone will be able to benefit from that. As mentioned on the&nbsp;<a href="https://help.netflix.com/fr-ca/node/55764">Netflix Ultra HD support page</a>, 4K streaming only works on&nbsp;select 2018 or later Mac computers with an Apple T2 Security chip (via <em><a href="https://www.macg.co/mac/2020/09/netflix-en-4k-sur-mac-uniquement-pour-les-machines-avec-puce-t2-116775">MacGeneration</a></em>).</p>

<p>In addition to a T2 chip Mac, you also need the latest version of Safari running on macOS Big Sur, a screen capable of displaying a 4K 60Hz image (compliant with the HDCP 2.2 standard in the case of an external screen), and a subscription plan that supports Ultra HD streaming.</p>
<p>Here’s an interesting take on the T2 chip requirement from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/j2cik9/youll_need_a_mac_with_a_t2_chip_to_be_able_to/">Reddit</a> user:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“This makes zero sense to me. The only Macs, that could really benefit from 4k streaming, without an external monitor, are the 4k and 5k iMacs yet only 2 models (the Pro and the new 2020 27″) will be able to stream it. Windows machines don’t have any kind of T2 alternative and are still able to stream 4k via Edge or via the native app, their only requirement is a 7th gen intel cpu or a dedicated graphics card.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Below is the&nbsp;list of Macs compatible with 4K Netflix streaming:</p>
<ul>
<li>iMac Pro (late 2017)</li>
<li>Mac mini (late 2018)</li>
<li>MacBook Air ( 2018 and up)</li>
<li>MacBook Pro (2018 and up)</li>
<li>Mac Pro (2019)</li>
<li>iMac (2020)</li>
</ul>
<p>What do you guys think of the T2 chip requirement for streaming Netflix in Ultra HD?</p>

September 30, 2020 | https://blog.domenic.me/hacktoberfest/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.domenic.me/hacktoberfest/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>For the last couple of years, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> has run
<a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest</a>, which purports to “support open source” by giving free
t-shirts to people who send pull requests to open source repositories.</p>

<p>In reality, <strong>Hacktoberfest is a corporate-sponsored distributed denial of service attack against the open source
maintainer community</strong>.</p>

<p>So far today, on <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aspam">a single repository</a>, myself
and fellow maintainers have closed 11 spam pull requests. Each of these generates notifications, often email, to the 485
watchers of the repository. And each of them requires maintainer time to visit the pull request page, evaluate its
spamminess, close it, tag it as spam, lock the thread to prevent further spam comments, and then report the spammer to
GitHub in the hopes of stopping their time-wasting rampage.</p>

<p>The rate of spam pull requests is, at this time, around four per hour. <em>And it’s not even October yet in my timezone.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://blog.domenic.me/images/hacktoberfest-spam-listing.png" alt="A screenshot showing a spam query for the whatwg/html repository, which is at this time up to 14 spam PRs"></p>

<p>Myself and other maintainers of the whatwg/html repository are not alone in suffering this deluge.
<a href="https://twitter.com/gravitystorm/status/1311386082982924289">My tweet</a> got commiseration from
<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/gravitystorm/status/1311386082982924289">OpenStreetMap, phpMyAdmin</a>,
<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/ulmerleben/status/1311378655231332355">PubCSS</a>,
<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/JakeDChampion/status/1311389420638138370">GitHub, the Financial Times</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/slicknet/status/1311377444188770312">ESLint</a>, a
<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/zekjur/status/1311411780162326531">computer club website</a>, and
<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/juliusvolz/status/1311412919196844038">a conference website</a>, just within the first couple
of hours. Since then a dedicated account “<a href="https://twitter.com/shitoberfest">@shitoberfest</a>” has arisen to document the
barrage. Some <a href="https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+%22improve+docs%22+created%3A%3E2020-09-29&amp;type=Issues">cursory</a>
<a href="https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+label%3Ainvalid+created%3A%3E2020-09-29&amp;type=Issues">searches</a> show thousands of
spam pull requests, and rising.</p>

<p>DigitalOcean seems to be aware that they have a spam problem. Their solution, per their
<a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/faq">FAQ</a>, is to put the burden solely on the shoulders of maintainers. If we go
out of our way to tag a contribution as spam, then… we slightly decrease the chance of the spammer getting their free
t-shirt. In reality, the spammer will just keep going, submitting more pull requests to more repositories, until they
finally find a repository where the maintainer doesn’t bother to tag the PR as spam, or where the maintainer isn’t
available during the seven-day window DigitalOcean uses for spam-tracking.</p>

<p>To be clear, myself and my fellow maintainers did not ask for this. This is not an opt-in situation. If your open source
project is public on GitHub, DigitalOcean will incentivize people to spam you. There is no consent involved. Either we
contribute to DigitalOcean’s marketing project, or,
<a href="https://twitter.com/SudoFox/status/1311431141702819840">they suggest, we should quit open source</a>.</p>

<p>Hacktoberfest does not support open source. Instead, it drives open source maintainers even closer to
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=open+source+burnout">burnout</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.domenic.me/images/hacktoberfest-spam-pr.png" alt="A screenshot of a spam PR which adds the heading &quot;Great Work&quot; to the HTML Standard README"></p>

<h2 id="what-can-we-do">What can we do?</h2>

<p>My most fervent hope is that DigitalOcean will see the harm they are doing to the open source community, and put an end
to Hacktoberfest. I hope they can do it as soon as possible, before October becomes another lowpoint in the hell-year
that is 2020. In 2021, they could consider relaunching it as an opt-in project, where maintainers consent on a
per-repository basis to deal with such t-shirt–incentivized contributors.</p>

<p>To protect ourselves, maintainers have a few options. First, you can take the feeble step of ensuring that any spam
against your repositories doesn’t contribute to the spammer’s “t-shirt points”, by tagging pull requests with a “spam”
label, and <a href="https://twitter.com/MattIPv4/status/1311390498888781824">emailing hacktoberfest@digitalocean.com</a>.
DigitalOcean themselves, however, admit that
<a href="https://twitter.com/MattIPv4/status/1311390054334554113">this won’t stop the problem they’ve unleashed on us</a>. But
maybe it will contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/MattIPv4/hacktoberfest-data">metrics</a> they collect, which last year
showed that “only” 3,712 pull requests were labeled as spam by project maintainers.</p>

<p>If you’re comfortable cutting off genuine contributions from new users, you can try enabling GitHub’s
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/building-a-strong-community/limiting-interactions-in-your-repository">interaction limits</a>.
However, <del>you have to do this every 24 hours, and</del> it has the drawback of also disabling issue creation and
comments. <ins>Update: GitHub has made the limit configurable, and has
<a href="https://twitter.com/github/status/1311772722234560517">a nice cheeky announcement tweet</a> zooming in on the “1 month”
option.</ins></p>

<p>Another promising route would be if GitHub would cut off DigitalOcean’s API access, as
<a href="https://twitter.com/__agwa/status/1311399074814472194">Andrew Ayer has suggested</a>. It’s not clear whether DigitalOcean
is committing a terms of service violation that would support such measures. But they’re certainly making GitHub a
less-pleasant place to be, and I hope GitHub can think seriously about how to discourage such corporate-sponsored
attacks on the open source community.</p>

<p>Finally, and most importantly, we can remember that this is how DigitalOcean treats the open source maintainer
community, and stay away from their products going forward. Although we’ve enjoyed using them for hosting the
<a href="https://whatwg.org/">WHATWG</a> standards organization, this kind of behavior is not something we want to support, so
we’re starting to investigate alternatives.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A tipping point has been reached in what is legally considered news. Critiquing a news source by  questioning the facts presented, the manner in which they were communicated, the source's validity, the broadcaster's motivations or any inherent biases that may exist, is no longer a fruitful activity.</p>
<p>That line of critique has been swept aside by legally muddying what news is. The presenter is no longer required to convey any truths and the onus of verification has entirely shifted from the news source to the audience.</p>
<p>There are two ways on how this has been achieved.</p>
<p><em>Burden of Verification</em>: A "reasonable" viewer is expected to "arrive with an appropriate amount of skepticism" based on the material presented by the news outlet. Any lies that the news broadcast may convey are not actionable because the viewer is expected to filter out lies from the truth. Even if the news source is spewing lies they're given a pass because the viewer should have known better to believe it in the first place to believe it. That is, any "reasonable" viewer. Adding this word into any court's ruling opens up the door to say anything.</p>
<p><em>False Presupposition</em>: The presenter can state an assumption which is very likely to be false (or known to be false) and then base future arguments on the suspect assumption. As long as what follows traces back to the false assumption, all is good and anything can be said. For example if a host says "We’re going to start by stipulating that everything Michael Cohen has told the feds is absolutely true", then the presenter has wide latitude on what conclusions they can draw, without ever worrying about whether Cohen was lying.</p>
<p>There are two compounding factors which make this especially harmful.</p>
<p><em>Inability for Skepticism</em>:  The constant bombarding of rhetoric in news shows overwhelms its audience and amplifies the echo in the chamber that the viewer already lives in. There is no pause (or desire to pause) to reflect on whether the information presented should be met with skepticism. The expectation that the consumer has the ability to be skeptical is wrong. The medium has become powerful enough that it overrides a human being's ability to be skeptical, especially one who <em>wants to believe</em> in the lie.</p>
<p><em>Repackaging</em>: Having talk shows disguise as news programs is a laughably easy way of repackaging lies without risking the penalty of being called out. Twenty-four hour news channels can have talk shows with millions of viewers who tune in to get some semblance of valid information. I provide the "some semblance" qualifier only because the audience have been conditioned enough and are polarized enough that they no longer can think on their own, and only tune in to reinforce whatever they already believe. As there is no material differentiation between talk shows and news programs for the audience, the convenient repackaging gives the broadcaster an out to say anything and hide behind the argument, "it's not news, it's a talk show".</p>

              Dear CodeShip users,</p><p>We are reaching out to inform you of additional information we have uncovered as a result of our continuing investigation of the recent GitHub breach. To provide maximum transparency, we are reporting on the results of our investigation, the impact on users, actions you must take to protect yourself/your organization, and actions we will take to strengthen our security processes going forward.</p><p>On Wednesday, September 16, 2020, CloudBees was notified by GitHub of suspicious activities targeting CodeShip business accounts connected to GitHub via the CodeShip GitHub app and now deprecated CodeShip OAuth tokens. CloudBees immediately initiated an investigation conducted by our security and engineering teams, and on September 27, we identified additional evidence of malicious activity against a failover CodeShip database. On September 29, we uncovered evidence to indicate that a malicious actor had access to this failover instance during the period of June 2019 to June 2020. At this time and to the best of our knowledge, we have no evidence of malicious activity or attempts within CodeShip systems since June 2020. </p><p>*What type of data was affected?*</p><p>The impacted accounts are those of CodeShip users. No other products or accounts were affected and CodeShip is in no way integrated with other CloudBees products or systems.</p><p>*For all CodeShip users:*</p><p>CodeShip users hashed account passwords, one-time password (OTP) recovery codes, and the OTP secret keys used to seed two-factor authentication all may have been exposed.</p><p>Business contact information for invoicing purposes such as company contact name, company name, VAT number, postal address, phone number also may have been exposed. No payment information, such as bank account numbers or credit card numbers, was exposed. No other CloudBees product other than CodeShip was impacted. Also, the logging system was not accessed for any customers.</p><p>*For CodeShip Basic users:*</p><p>Any information contained in CodeShip users’ pipelines may have been exposed.

<![CDATA[Defer Reference Implementation for C]]>

September 30, 2020 | https://gustedt.gitlabpages.inria.fr/defer/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://gustedt.gitlabpages.inria.fr/defer/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-1-1">
<p>
In the following code snippet we
have one <i>guarded block</i> and three <i>deferred statements</i>.
</p>

<div>
<pre>guard {
  <span>void</span> * <span>const</span> <span>p</span> = malloc(25);
  <span>if</span> (<span>!</span>p) <span>break</span>;
  <span>defer</span> <span>free</span>(p);

  <span>void</span> * <span>const</span> <span>q</span> = malloc(25);
  <span>if</span> (<span>!</span>q) <span>break</span>;
  <span>defer</span> <span>free</span>(q);

  <span>if</span> (mtx_lock(&amp;mut)==thrd_error) <span>break</span>;
  <span>defer</span> <span>mtx_unlock</span>(&amp;mut);

  <span>// </span><span>all resources acquired</span>
}

</pre>
</div>

<p>
The idea is that we indicate with a <b><code>defer</code></b> keyword that the
statement, e.g a call to <b><code>free</code></b>, is only to be executed at the end of
the guarded block, and, that we want this action to happen
unconditionally in which way ever the guarded block is left.  For the
three deferred statements together it says that they should be
executed in the inverse order than they were encountered. So the
control flow for this code example can be visualized as follows:
</p>



<p><img src="https://gustedt.gitlabpages.inria.fr/defer/defer-image.png" alt="defer-image.png">
</p>

<p>
Here, the dashed lines represent circumstancial control flow that
might arise when some resources are not available or when the
execution is interrupted by a signal.
</p>

<p>
This new technique has at least two advantages to commonly used <code>C</code> or
<code>C++</code> techniques:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>proximity</dt><dd>The cleanup code (<code>free</code> or <code>mtx_unlock</code>) is coded
close to the place where its need arises.</dd>

<dt>visibility</dt><dd>The cleanup code is not hidden in some previously
defined function (such as for <code>atexit</code> handlers) or
constructor/destructor pairs (<code>C++</code>)</dd>
</dl>


<p>
For normal control flow (without intermediate <b><code>return</code></b>, <code>exit</code>, …)
code with similar properties can be coded with existing tools. The
above is equivalent to something like the following
</p>

<div>
<pre>{
   <span>void</span> * <span>const</span> <span>p</span> = malloc(25);
   <span>if</span> (<span>!</span>p) <span>goto</span> <span>DEFER0</span>;
   <span>if</span> (<span>false</span>) {
     <span>DEFER1</span>:
       free(p);
       <span>goto</span> <span>DEFER0</span>;
   }

   <span>void</span> * <span>const</span> <span>q</span> = malloc(25);
   <span>if</span> (<span>!</span>q) <span>goto</span> <span>DEFER1</span>;

   <span>if</span> (<span>false</span>) {
     <span>DEFER2</span>:
       free(q);
       <span>goto</span> <span>DEFER1</span>;
   }

   <span>if</span> (mtx_lock(&amp;mut)==thrd_error) <span>goto</span> <span>DEFER2</span>;

   <span>if</span> (<span>false</span>) {
     <span>DEFER3</span>:
       mtx_unlock(&amp;mut);
       <span>goto</span> <span>DEFER2</span>;
   }

   <span>// </span><span>all resources acquired</span>

   <span>goto</span> <span>DEFER3</span>;
   <span>DEFER0</span>:;
}

</pre>
</div>

<p>
Here, the <b><code>if(false)</code></b> clauses guarantee that the deferred statements
are jumped over when they are first met, and the labels and <b><code>goto</code></b>
statements implement the hops from back to front to execute the
deferred statements eventually.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, most <code>C</code> programmers would not code like this but they
would prefer to write down a <i>linearization</i> of the above, which is a
quite common idiom for cleanup handling in <code>C</code>:
</p>

<div>
<pre>{
   <span>void</span> * <span>const</span> <span>p</span> = malloc(25);
   <span>if</span> (<span>!</span>p) <span>goto</span> <span>DEFER0</span>;

   <span>void</span>*<span>const</span> <span>q</span> = malloc(25);
   <span>if</span> (<span>!</span>q) <span>goto</span> <span>DEFER1</span>;

   <span>if</span> (mtx_lock(&amp;mut)==thrd_error) <span>goto</span> <span>DEFER2</span>;

   <span>// </span><span>all resources acquired</span>

   mtx_unlock(&amp;mut);

 <span>DEFER2</span>:
   free(q);
 <span>DEFER1</span>:
   free(p);
 <span>DEFER0</span>:;
}

</pre>
</div>

<p>
This has the advantage of only making the circumstantial control flow
explicit (with three *=goto=) but it does that for the price of
proximity; the cleanup code is far from the place where its need
arises.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, even this linearization needs some form of naming
convention for the labels. For more complicated code the maintenance
of these jumps can be tricky and prone to errors.  This shows another
advantage of the <a href="#org63e5a5c"><code>defer</code></a> approach:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>maintainability</dt><dd>The cleanup specification is not dependent on
arbitrary naming such as labels (<code>C</code>) or RAII classes
(<code>C++</code>) and does not change when <a href="#org63e5a5c"><code>defer</code></a> or <b><code>break</code></b>
statements are added or removed.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Another important property that is much more difficult to implement in
<code>C</code> (and that needs <b><code>try/catch</code></b> blocks in <code>C++</code>) is that <b>all</b> exits
from the guarded block are detected and acted upon: <b><code>break</code></b>, <b><code>return</code></b>,
<a href="#org18b8cc4"><code>thrd_exit</code></a>, <a href="#org9db677d"><code>exit</code></a>, <a href="#org7f6c106"><code>panic</code></a>, or
an interruption by a signal. That is, unless there are nasal deamons
flying around, we have a forth important property
</p>


<dl>
<dt>robustness</dt><dd>Any deferred statement is guaranteed to be executed
eventually.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This is different from <code>C++</code>'s handling of destructors, which are only
guaranteed to be executed if there is a <b><code>try/catch</code></b> block underneath.
</p>

<p>
This principle of deferred execution extends to nested
guarded blocks in a natural way, even if they are stacked in
different function calls.

<p>Qiskit hosted a course this past summer, which saw over 4000 students from more than 100 countries registering to attend the same quantum computing courses taught to IBM Quantum interns. Now, Qiskit is planning to offer the same course to anyone who wants to get their feet wet in the world of quantum computing and quantum hardware.</p>



<p>One of the core beliefs the Qiskit team holds to is that anyone trained right can program a quantum computer. Because of this belief, the team wrote an open-source textbook that teaches readers how to use Qiskit in quantum computing. The training is both effective and thorough. A survey revealed that 92 percent of QGSS participants felt that the Qiskit Global Summer School exceeded or was equivalent to other quantum computing courses available.</p>

The lectures will teach students the basics of programming a quantum computer, introduce famous algorithms such as Shor’s and Grover’s algorithm, and give an overview of how they built quantum bits and use them to represent data. There will even be an introduction to quantum chemistry included. Two prerequisites are a basic understanding of the Python language and linear algebra.</p>



<p>Qiskit believes that quantum computing should be accessible by all, and access to this knowledge should not be limited.

<h2 id="000004">00:00:04</h2>

<p>Welcome to Signals &amp; Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky. So, it’s my pleasure today to have a conversation with Greta Yorsh. Greta is a compiler engineer in our compilers team in the London office, and she also has a rich and interesting background in compilers and programming languages and program analysis and verification, and we’re going to talk about all that. She’s also had a lot of experience in both industry and academia, and since 2018, Great has worked with us working on the OCaml compiler. So, Greta, to start with, can you talk about how you got interested in compiler optimization?</p>

<h2 id="000044">00:00:44</h2>

<div><p>I studied in Israel. I did my undergraduate studies in computer science and economics. I found that I don’t cope well with uncertainty, so the interesting mathematical bits of economics were not the right choice for me. So, I decided to do a PhD in computer science in the area of software verification where a lot of the concerns are about ensuring things, so that fits well with my approach to certain things. And after my PhD, I worked for a few years at IBM Watson Research Center in New York working on program analysis and verification problems.
</p><p> After that, I moved to Cambridge in England, and I joined an amazing company, ARM, that makes processors, and I worked there in the compilers team working on the GCC compiler backend for ARM, and after that, I worked at Queen Mary University of London as an assistant professor, or lecturer it’s called in England, where I did research in teaching in the area of compilers, and then recently, a year and a half ago, I joined Jane Street. At Jane Street, I work on the compilers team on the OCaml compiler.</p></div>

<h2 id="000209">00:02:09</h2>

<p>Tell us a little bit more about how that fits into the arc of your research.</p>

<h2 id="000214">00:02:14</h2>

<div><p>I started my research working on the problem of software verification or certain aspects of this problem, proving that software satisfies certain good properties, correctness properties that users expect from it, and that research involved a lot of reasoning about the source code of the program rather than executing it and then using certain formal methods and logical reasoning techniques, decision procedures, in order to prove properties of the program.
</p><p> I worked on that for a while, and there’s this ultimate goal of proving that the software behaves just the way it should be so that real-world executions of their program don’t cause terrible failures, and I was very excited about it for a while, but it is an undecidable problem, a problem that is very hard to solve in general, and that becomes a bit frustrating after a while, and I was interested in what is it that real programmers and users of software want to prove about their programs, and how I can help them using the techniques that I know and the logic that I know.
</p><p> So I worked on that, and in the process of that, I’ve discovered that it’s really fun to work with real users and have people who care about certain things. I don’t know what they care about, but if I talk to them, maybe I’ll find out, and maybe one of the tools I have in my toolbox will help me to give users a tool, and I found it very exciting. I think the first time it happened, it was at IBM, and I was really excited about it, but what I also realized is that not everyone really cares about correctness, that sometimes it’s okay to have bugs in their programs.
</p><p> There are other important aspects of software, like performance. That made a big change to my understanding, because I could now put these very formal techniques together with something practical and try to combine the two. And then when I had the chance to work at ARM on the GCC compiler backend for ARM, I’ve discovered how important it is, the performance and how exciting it is to work on this micro-optimization, CPU-specific, machine-specific optimization, how much difference they make to the behavior of the program, to the performance behavior from these characteristics of the program, and at the same time, working on the compiler, you just can’t have bugs. An important property of the compiler is that so much else in our system is built on top of it. That was a tool that combines correctness and performance. It’s an optimization function that is very clear and measurable, as opposed to what properties do users want to have for their programs, and that’s how I came to work in compilers.</p></div>

<h2 id="000458">00:04:58</h2>

<div><p>Yeah, it’s interesting, you’re starting off by focusing on verification, because I think verification is this very shiny and attractive goal, because there’s this basic fact about programming, which is that we’re all terrible at it. Humans are bad at writing programs. Program languages are things that, at their best, do, infuriatingly, only the very specific things you ask them to do and not what you intended, and so trying to close that gap between the thing you tried to do and the terrible thing that you actually wrote down is an attractive goal.
</p><p> You were talking about one of the problems of verification, and just to be clear, by verification, formal methods (lots of terms here), we basically mean coming up with the moral equivalent of a proof that a program matches some specification. So you write in some precise, higher-level way what the program is supposed to do, and then there’s the actual program that you’ve written, and some kind of proof of the program does what it’s intended to do. You mentioned undecidability – an undecidable problem is one where you can show that there is no general technique that solves it all the time, and you mention that as a sign of how difficult the problem is. But, it’s a funny thing, in some sense almost everything that we do is undecidable, right? You can’t answer almost any interesting question about a program in full generality, the classic result being the halting program: You can’t even tell whether a given problem is going to ever finish executing in a general way. But that normally doesn’t stop us. The way we deal with this is we tend to provide people not with fully automated systems that solve all of their problems, but instead, tools that they can use while they write programs. They can maybe do some extra work along the side to help ensure the correctness of those programs, and those tools might be in the form of testing systems, and they might be in the forms of something that looks more like formal methods, things that, essentially, along with the program, develop some aspect of the proof of correctness of the program. So, I’m curious what you think about the kind of practicality and ergonomics of formal methods as a thing that can be layered into the programming process to make it easier for people to write programs that do the right thing.</p></div>

<h2 id="000702">00:07:02</h2>

<div><p>The kind of verification, proving properties of programs, that I think of when I say software verification (traditional methods) involve writing a program in one language and then providing specification of its behavior, telling what properties should hold about the program in a different language, in logic of some kind that describes it, and then proving that the specification and the implementation are conformed. That is very different from the type system approach that OCaml takes where the types are the specification of the program, and that is something I’m learning as I become better at programming in OCaml. But the kind of verification I’m talking about, the idea of specifying these properties on the side somewhere or even in the program, but in a different syntax, I think is a big problem for adopting this kind of technology. It’s possible to specify something about the library, but keeping it up to date as the code evolves is very hard. Same problem with documentation, but as you try to reason about it, and you have a tool that runs together with the specification and the code and checks them against each other as you do the development, there is some hope to keep the code and the spec aligned, but still, the programmer needs to write both of them. So, there is opportunity for automation to save some work for the programmer and keep the two aligned.
</p><p> I also wanted to mention, when you were talking about verification, so different people think of verification as different things. To me, it is what you said. It’s the more formal proof about the source code of the program and its properties, but for most of the development process, it is testing. It’s running the program on some inputs and checking that the outputs behave as we expect. So, after working a bit and trying to find the right logics that are expressive enough to describe the properties we want and at the same time, allow us to prove automatically that the program conforms to these properties, you find, “oh, this is very restrictive.” Then you look, but testing is so much better. “I’ve been working on this for two years, but I could’ve found this bug with a simple test.” So how do we find tests that are good tests, or do we have good tests? So, this problem has been worked on by many people, and what I find exciting is that taking the testing approach, finding test cases, and the formal proof approach, and combining them helps us build better tools. So, there are many ways in which each side can help the other, and I worked on exploring some of these ways, and I found it very interesting. And I think this shows up in the verification, but there are also similar combinations of static and dynamic information or execution time and compile time information that are useful for compilers during compilations.</p></div>

<h2 id="000949">00:09:49</h2>

<p>It’s interesting for you to say this thing about the way in which tests and formal proofs mix together. I feel like this is a thing that I’ve noticed informally on my own in programming, which is the OCaml type system, and in general type systems, are a kind of lightweight formal method. Types only capture some fairly limited properties of …</p></div></div>

The following article contains examples of artificial intelligence in healthcare and companies doing a great job at it.</h2></p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1600557578492_4166"><div><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Artificial intelligence (AI), Machine learning, NLP, Robotics, and Automation are increasingly prevalent in all aspects and are being applied to healthcare as well. These technologies have the potential to transform all aspects of health care from patient care to the development and production of new experimental drugs that can have a faster roll-out date than traditional methods.&nbsp;</p><p>There are numerous research studies suggesting that AI can outperform humans at key healthcare tasks, such as diagnosing ailments. Here is a great example, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-50857759#:~:text=Artificial%20intelligence%20is%20more%20accurate,images%20from%20nearly%2029%2C000%20women." target="_blank">AI ‘outperforms’ doctors diagnosing breast cancer¹.</a></p><p>Artificial intelligence is a collection of technologies that come together form artificial intelligence. AI’s diverse range of technologies impacts a wide spectrum of healthcare.&nbsp;</p><p>Tech firms and startups are also working assiduously on the same issues. Google, for example, is collaborating with health delivery networks to build prediction models from big data to warn clinicians of high-risk conditions, such as sepsis and heart failure. Google, Enlitic, and a variety of other startups are developing AI-derived image interpretation algorithms. Jvion offers a ‘clinical success machine’ that identifies the patients most at risk as well as those most likely to respond to treatment protocols. Each of these could provide decision support to clinicians seeking to find the best diagnosis and treatment for patients.</p><p>You will find below some technologies that improve a specific area in healthcare with examples sourced from the internet with citations.&nbsp;</p><h3>Machine learning</h3><p>Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI)<em> </em>that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves².</p><p>There are majorly three types of Machine learning — </p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Supervised Learning</p></li><li><p>Unsupervised Learning</p></li><li><p>Reinforcement Learning&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>In healthcare, the most common application of machine learning is predictive medicine  —  predicting what treatment alternatives are likely to work best on a patient based on various patient traits, history, the treatment situation, and protocols. The supervised learning model for predictive medicine applications requires a training dataset, like all supervised learning models. the difference here is that there may be a lot of variables.&nbsp;</p><p>Using neural networks it is now possible to also predict whether a patient will acquire a particular ailment or not based on a set of variables and conditions that can be fed into algorithms in the form of data.</p><p>One common application of deep learning and neural networks is the ability to detect ailments/issues in the radiology images. I think deep learning should be increasingly applied wherever clinically possible. This will allow doctors and radiologists to just supervise results and focus on other important aspects of their job. This combination promises better accuracy of finding ailments with limited human intervention or supervision.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some organizations that are doing groundbreaking work in this area.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Organization:</strong> <a href="https://www.pathai.com/">PathAI</a><br><strong>Location: </strong>Cambridge, Massachusetts<br><strong>How it’s using AI in healthcare:</strong> PathAI is developing machine learning technology to assist pathologists in making more accurate diagnoses.

The company’s deep learning platform analyzes unstructured medical data (radiology images, blood tests, EKGs, genomics, patient medical history) to give doctors better insight into a patient’s real-time needs³.</p></blockquote><h3>Natural language processing</h3><p>In healthcare, most applications of NLP involve the creation, understanding, parsing, and classification of clinical documentation and published research. NLP can also be used to analyze clinical notes, prescriptions, help prepare reports, and possibly conversational AI. Few good examples of how NLP is currently being used.&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Parsing data realtime from coronavirus research that is being published globally. You can find more information about this in my article <a href="https://medium.com/@sanksshep/how-can-ai-help-with-the-covid-19-vaccine-search-a68d40fc0cb0" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Project Meena by Google. More information can be found <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/01/towards-conversational-agent-that-can.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>Decision Tree&nbsp;</h3><p>Decision trees require doctors and engineers to come up with an if-then-else decision flow chart that can help train machines to make decisions by building complex algorithms based on the finalized decision tree. This is critical and processes heavy software design, this enables the machines to take accurate decisions with human intervention. This will help save a ton of time for doctors and patients alike. This will enhance the capabilities of doctors to predict, analyze, and come up with a treatment plan for patient care.&nbsp;</p><p>This can also be used extensively in vaccine and treatment research provided the known variable is the ailment we are making the vaccine for and its pre-set conditions and protocols. This is an effective mechanism for pre-morbidity patients as well.&nbsp;</p><h3>Robotics</h3><p>Robots are becoming more intelligent, as other AI capabilities are being embedded in their OS. Other areas of improvements in AI have exponentially improved the capabilities of the robots and their ability to perform complex operations.</p><p>One such area of operation is robotic surgery. This enables surgeons to perform complex procedures with much greater precision and create precise, minimized, invasive incisions, and stitches. This is a game-changer in performing surgery, as long as human supervision exists. &nbsp;</p><p>Here are some examples of organizations using AI and Robotics&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Organization: </strong><a href="https://www.vicarioussurgical.com/" target="_blank">Vicarious Surgical</a><br><strong>Location: </strong>Charlestown, Massachusetts<br><strong>How it’s using AI in healthcare: </strong>Vicarious Surgical combines virtual reality with AI-enabled robots so surgeons can perform minimally invasive operations.

It relies on a combination of workflow, business rules, and ‘presentation layer’ integration with information systems to act like a semi-intelligent user of the systems. In healthcare, they are used for repetitive tasks like prior authorization, updating patient records, or billing. When combined with other technologies like image recognition, they can be used to extract data from, for example, faxed images in order to input it into transactional systems.</p><h3>Mass personalization</h3><p>Artificial Intelligence can help in mass personalization of patient care, treatments, procedures, vaccine research, and production.

			<p>Living is great and I'd prefer to do more of it. Unfortunately, progress towards immortality has been rather slow — for all of our technological progress in the last century we've only picked up a few extra years of life. An incorrect framing of the problem has led to slow progress, but with a little bit of mind shift we can choose much better strategies for learning about and manipulating biology.</p>
<h3 id="what-s-the-status-quo-">What's the status quo?</h3>
<p>There's been a subset of humans over the last 100 years who also would like to live longer and healthier lives and have invested considerable time and energy into this problem. They've mostly failed as is evidence by the fact if you make it out of childhood, keep a good BMI, stop smoking, and exercise, you'll make it, at best, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy">a decade longer than someone in the 1700s</a> (provided you escaped the trough of death that was childhood). In that same 100 years we took our first flight on Earth and then landed on the moon. In that same 100 years we went from 0 transistors per chip to 50,000,000,000. In that same 100 years we invented the Cool Ranch Dorito. So why did we succeed in so many other places but have failed in the most important? Why don't we live extremely long, healthy, and happy lives?</p>
<h3 id="why-has-this-approach-worked-in-other-areas-">Why has this approach worked in other areas?</h3>
<p>Some problems are, in retrospect, clearly easier than others. But if you had surveyed the leading minds in 1900 which would be easier: splitting the atom, sending a probe outside the solar system, or living to 90, it's hard to imagine it would be the last option they would have chosen. Yet here we are.</p>
<p>There are problems that on the face of it seem of similar difficulty to an outsider but are magnitudes (and magnitudes and magnitudes) harder to solve. What leads to this difference can be summarized as <em>computational reducibility</em>. As way of example, take the planet. Think of every atom on Earth- the rocks, the trees, that one ex who still drifts in and out of memory. If I want to know where this sphere will be in the universe tomorrow or 1,000 years from now and I don't have a notion of basic physics I may think this intractable. There's so much going on! How could one possibly think to describe how all these atoms would move through space and time? But it turns out to be fairly trivial - all those atoms can be reduced to a single point, a center of mass, and then calculations of momentum can be easily computed and trajectory projected forward. There are many systems that allow for these "shortcuts" where the dimensionality can be collapsed and the useful information is still present. A bridge builder doesn't need to think of each atom in a brick, or even really the brick; it's enough to think of the collection of bricks and how they are arranged.</p>
<h3 id="engineering-takes-place-in-reducible-places">Engineering takes place in reducible places</h3>
<p>Engineering, generally, is the practice of working on problems that are tractable. Given constraints on energy and time, only hard problems that have been sufficiently reduced are tractable and as such are the ones that are worked on. Oftentimes science leads us to new ways of reducing the complexity of problems (think Newton and his equations in the previous example). This isn't a law, just a result of how resources are allocated. </p>
<h3 id="is-biology-reducible-">Is Biology Reducible?</h3>
<p>We haven't seen progress in biology because it is stubborn to attempts to reduce it. Darwin was one of the last great reducers - able to collapse the high dimensional problem of evolution into a few axioms. But even with natural selection in hand, the resolution of claims is not particularly specific. Hypotheses are hard to prove or disprove given the near impossibility of running a counterfactual and it mostly serves as a post-hoc description (large proboscis <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthopan">moths</a> notwithstanding). Perhaps if we were luckier we could  have lived in a universe that allowed us to use natural selection to know the structure of cells and animals without having to go look (this is a little true - something I'll explore in a future post), similar to knowing the position of the planets a millennia in advance.</p>
<p>What is it about biology that makes it irreducible but splitting the atom was something we accomplished 80 years ago? Spitting in the face of entropy is hard and the number of problems that need to be solved by a biological system are vast. The components of that system are not elegant fundamental laws of the universe but artisanal components created by random search through a loosely constrained fitness space. Even highly conserved pathways still exist in a unique context of the whole organism. </p>
<h3 id="biology-s-drunken-walk">Biology's Drunken Walk</h3>
<p>Biology is constantly transitioning from current state to a future state where some future branch of the evolutionary tree has higher fitness but the potential branch space is massive and the "choice" of which branch is picked is a random process. For example, in a scenario where the environment is slowly acidifying, any given bacteria has many solutions to survive. While aesthetically they could be vastly different (off the top of my head: changes to cell membranes, additional transmembrane proton pumps, neutralizing organelles, heat shock proteins, etc), which one ends up being dominant for a given bacteria is a random mutation. Given enough bacteria "searching" the solution space, you'll likely see many solutions.</p>
<p>Crucially, because in any scenario there is a one-to-many relationship between a problem and solutions, you can't extrapolate which solutions an organism possesses based on reasoning. You can’t postdict, you have to go look.</p>
<h3 id="so-what-do-we-do-">So, what do we do?</h3>
<p>So biology suffers from low reducibility - we aren’t able to summarize systems allowing us to make inferences cheaply. In the instance of disease this prevents both easy understanding of the disease state, i.e. what is going wrong, and prevents easy drug design, i.e. which node in the system do I push on in order to reverse the disease state. Right now, drug discovery is a lot of serendipity and a lot of pretending we know enough to pick targets. Unsurprisingly, this mostly fails.</p>
<p>There is another way. Currently, we brute force biology via Grad student search and it’s remarkably slow. A small number of underpowered, poorly done experiments makes up the bulk of what is produced. A model organism is chosen, an intervention is proposed, a measurement is done, and a paper is written: repeat ad nauseam. </p>
<p>But if an infinite number of monkeys can write Shakespeare, an infinite number of mice can allow us a way forward.</p>
<p>If we care about blood pressure, for example, why have we not given every drug, at every dosage, every regiment, and in every combination to a mouse and actually seen what happens?
We <em>do</em> have high throughput screening, mostly in individual cells or enzymes, but this is mostly garbage owing to the information decay from cell to whole organism (something I will expound on in a future post). Is my proposed solution expensive? Yes! Combinatorial explosions are the opposite of computational reducibility. But my point is that we can't just hope to have cheaper solutions in the future – that is the ostrich approach to progress. And we spent $288,100,000,000 to get to the moon.</p>
<p>The problem is also not as intractable as it may first seem. How do we test a large number of drugs on a large number of mice? Drive the cost down on any marginal mouse. Recent advances in machine learning allow automation of those pesky variable costs. Image recognition and classification are now good enough to track a mouse and its movements automatically - there is no need to babysit mice and manually classify behavior. With the state of every mouse known, simple robotics, e.g. food/medication administration and outcome measurements, become possible. The simplest experiments are possible today, and with a concerted effort, the realm of possible can grow. </p>
<p>There will always be innovations in new measurement techniques, new ways of peering into the system. Biologists generally fail in scaling these new techniques at a detriment to our ability to control biology. By adding scalability as an important aspect of innovation we can unlock so much more with what we already have today. </p>
<p>Importantly, this isn't just limited to a causal inference between a drug and a disease. We're getting very good at measuring the state of systems, just pick your favorite "–ome". It's not hard to squint and see that large numbers of interventions, on large numbers of model organisms, with large readouts of state will approach full 4D models of organic systems.  </p>
<p>There are not going to be any shortcuts with biology. The sooner we recognize this, the sooner we can start building systems that operate at the scale needed to bring useful inference, drug discovery, and network topology into the 21st century. </p>
<p>Thank you to Aubree for her feedback on commas, words, and ideas.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Two weeks ago, Snowflake had the largest IPO ever for a software company. On the first day of trading, the stock price doubled, giving Snowflake a market cap of over $60 billion. Snowflake became all that everyone was talking about. There was so much hype, my mom, who doesn't even know what Snowflake is, decided to invest in Snowflake.</p><p>At first glance, the valuation of $60 billion seems absurd. Not only is Snowflake not profitable, having a net loss of $349 million in 2019, but their revenue is also small relative to their valuation. Their revenue over the last 12 months was $403 million. Based on that, their market cap is around 150x their revenue. So why exactly is their market cap so high? Besides revenue and profitability, there are a number of other metrics that investors look at. Compared to similar software businesses, Snowflake has god-like metrics. In this post, I'm going to go through a number of metrics from Snowflake's S-1, explain what the metrics mean, and give context on just how exceptional Snowflake's metrics are.</p><p>The first metric that stands out is Snowflakes 121% year over year growth. To give you a sense of how fantastic it is, you can compare it to the growth rates of other companies at IPO. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/24/how-fast-should-you-be-growing/">Institutional Venture Partners looked at how quickly Internet and software companies were growing at IPO</a>.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dad2b1e508f04886d0245c3/5f74c44d240d4de932d463c4_growth1.jpeg" alt="growth1"></p></figure><p>Based on their numbers, only 25% of companies that are between $75M-$500M in annual revenue are growing at just over 60% year over year. Snowflake's growth rate is nearly twice that! Snowflake's revenue was also $403M for the last 12 months, which would put them at the high end of that range. Not only are they growing significantly faster than other companies, but they are already significantly larger!</p><p>For companies that sell software to businesses an important number to look at is their retention rate. For Snowflake, their net retention rate is 158%. You may be asking, how do they have a retention rate over 100%? That's because companies that use Snowflake pay more for Snowflake over time. For every $1 of revenue Snowflake received from their customers a year ago, that same pool of customers are now paying $1.58. That means Snowflake could acquire no new customers, and they would still be doubling revenue every 18 months.</p><p>To compare that to other companies, <a href="https://www.lennyrachitsky.com/p/what-is-good-retention-issue-29">Lenny Rachitsky surveyed a number of industry experts on what they thought good and great net retention would be</a>. On average, for enterprise subscription software, the category Snowflake would fall under, the experts surveyed said 110% net retention would be good and 130% net retention would be great. He also pulled the net retention rates for a number of public companies:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Alteryx</strong>: 135% (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ogELPtct2s6jj9wRBpOgqGUE5k4cO73XXcvqmEZE89M/edit#gid=0">source</a>)</li><li><strong>Fastly</strong>: 130% (<a href="https://www.saastr.com/5-interesting-learnings-from-fastly-as-it-gets-ready-to-ipo/">source</a>)</li><li><strong>Okta</strong>: 124% (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ogELPtct2s6jj9wRBpOgqGUE5k4cO73XXcvqmEZE89M/edit#gid=0">source</a>)</li><li><strong>Anaplan</strong>: 124% (<a href="https://www.key.com/kco/images/Public_SaaS_Company_Retention_Metrics_2019.pdf">source</a>)</li><li><strong>Workday</strong>: 100%+ (<a href="https://www.workday.com/content/dam/web/en-us/documents/investor/workday-financial-analyst-day-2018.pdf">source</a>)</li><li><strong>ServiceNow</strong>: 97% (<a href="https://www.publiccomps.com/tickers/NOW">source</a>)</li></ul><p>You will notice that Snowflake's net retention rate of 158% is significantly higher than all of these!</p><p>Net promoter score (NPS) is a way of measuring customer satisfaction. It's convenient because it's easy to calculate and boils down customer satisfaction to a single number, making it easy to compare NPS between different companies. To compute NPS, a company performs a survey of their customers. The company asks "On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend this company’s product or service to a friend or a colleague?". Anyone that answers 9 or 10 is deemed a "promoter" of the product, while anyone that answers 6 or less is considered to be a "detractor". To compute the NPS, you take the percentage of users that are promoters and subtract the percentage of users that are detractors. This results in a number between -100 and 100 which is the NPS.</p><p>To give some examples, an NPS of 0 means your company has just as many promoters as detractors, whereas an NPS of 100 means everyone loves your product. Here are the NPS's for a few well known companies according to <a href="https://www.satmetrix.com/infographic/2020-us-consumer-benchmarks/">satmetrix</a>:</p><ul role="list"><li>Apple - 62</li><li>AirBnB - 43</li><li>AT&amp;T - 20</li></ul><p>What is Snowflake's NPS score? It's 71. According to NPS, Snowflake's customers like Snowflake more than Apple's customers like Apple.</p><p>The average Snowflake customer pays Snowflake $165k a year. Average contract value (ACV) is a useful metric to look at because it gives you a rough sense of how efficient a sales team is. To elaborate, there's a similar amount of work needed for a sales person to sell a $50k deal as there is for a sales person to sell a $100k deal. This is because most of the work a sales person does such as giving a demo, dealing with the paper process, and negotiating, have to happen regardless of how much the contract actually winds up being. Closing a $100k deal brings in twice as much revenue as a $50k deal does, but it's not usually twice as much work.</p><p>For this reason, higher average contract values are usually better. According to <a href="https://dskok-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-KBCM-SaaS-Survey.pdf">KBCM Technology Group</a>, 29% of software businesses have an ACV between $50k-$250k, and only 9% have an ACV greater than $250k. That gives Snowflake a relatively healthy ACV.</p><p>Not only does Snowflake have a high ACV, but their high end contract values are also really high. Snowflake has 56 customers that pay them over $1M a year. They also have Capital One, their largest customer, account for 11% of their 2019 revenue with approximately $29M.</p><p>Snowflake's net loss of $349M during 2019 does not sound good, but it does not tell the full story. There are two issues with using profit as a metric when looking at a subscription software business:</p><ul role="list"><li>Due to the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), a customer can give Snowflake money, but Snowflake can't count that money as revenue until a later date, even though that money is in Snowflake's bank account.</li><li>A net loss doesn't tell you where the money is coming in and where the money is going to.</li></ul><p>Addressing each of these points:</p><h3>Revenue under GAAP</h3><p>Under GAAP, Snowflake doesn't count revenue when a customer pays them, but instead when a customer uses the Snowflake product. To be more specific when a company pays Snowflake, they are purchasing a number of "Snowflake credits". When you are using the Snowflake product you exchange your credits for Snowflake compute time.</p><p>As an example, let's say a customer purchases one year of Snowflake credits for $100k. That money winds up in Snowflake's bank account, but Snowflake cannot count that $100k as revenue until Snowflake delivers the service, which is when the customer uses their credits for compute time. If the customer uses a quarter of the Snowflake credits within three months after purchases them, under GAAP, Snowflake would count that as $25k in revenue over those three months.</p><p>You can see the impact this has by looking at the $688M Snowflake has in "remaining performance obligations". This $688M is money that Snowflake's customers have either already given to Snowflake or have contractually committed to giving to Snowflake, but it won't show up as revenue until the customers use the credits they purchased.</p><h3>Where's the money going?</h3><p>The other thing to look at is what they are spending the money on. Snowflake is making money on every sale. They have a gross profit of 62% so they have no problem running the product. The thing is they are spending A LOT on sales and marketing. Their total net loss for the last six months was $171M while during the same time period they spent $191M on sales and marketing. If they wanted to, they could stop investing in growth, lay off their entire sales and marketing team, and they would become profitable. In other words, Snowflake could be profitable if they wanted to, but they are intentionally choosing not to, and are instead focusing on growing the customer base.</p><p>Not that they should. If we assume the $191M they spent in sales and marketing over the last six months was responsible for the $81M increase in revenue in the last six months compared to the prior six months, every $1 Snowflake invests in sales and marketing results in $.42 of revenue. With Snowflake's 158% net retention rate, that customer will pay back the initial investment in sales and marketing after around two years and then return many times the investment in the years following that.</p><p>In practice, Snowflake probably sees a return on investment much sooner. A company pays for Snowflake well before Snowflake is able to count that money as revenue.</p><p>So does it make sense for Snowflake's market cap to be 150x their revenue. I definitely think it's high, but I it's certainly plausible. They're growing faster, have higher customer satisfaction, and just have phenomenal metrics across the board when compared to similar businesses.</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) is some of the most tax-advantaged stock you can hold, yet few people know about it. If you’re a founder, early employee, or investor, you can potentially save millions of dollars by understanding the implications of QSBS.</p>



<p>In this article I will discuss the following:</p>



<ol><li>History of QSBS</li><li>QSBS Tax Savings</li><li>Requirements for QSBS</li><li>Section 1045 Rollover (applicable if you don’t meet the five year holding period, explained below)</li></ol>



<p>I recently sold shares in a company I co-founded and spoke to more than two dozen accountants in the process. I’m summarizing my findings and experiences in the article below. As such, the information in this article is not formal tax advice. I recommend you speak with your accountant prior to making any decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>History of QSBS</h2>



<p>Section 1202 is the section of the tax code that outlines the QSBS tax exclusion. It was added to the tax code in 1993 to encourage individuals to invest in new ventures, far before the creation of Silicon Valley as we know it today. The act, however, failed to provide the intended incentive of spurring investments in new ventures.</p>



<p>Over the past three decades, a number of tailwinds have propelled QSBS back into the limelight. Congress reduced the tax on long-term capital gains in 1997, increased the tax savings of QSBS incrementally until 2010, and finally reduced corporate taxes from 35% to a flat 21% in 2017. These three forces have made QSBS far more relevant today than in the past.</p>



<h2>QSBS Tax Savings</h2>



<p><strong>Under Section 1202, your gains from selling QSBS may be eligible for up to 100% exclusion from federal and state taxes. This exclusion is limited to the </strong><strong><em>greater</em></strong><strong> of $10 million or 10 times your cost basis during a liquidity event.</strong></p>



<p>For instance, the excludable amount for a founder may be on $10 million of gain, while the exclusion for a VC may be much greater. If, for instance, a VC invests $20 million, the VC may obtain an exclusion for $200 million of gain. See the “Scenario Table” in the Appendix for more examples. Please also note that if you end up selling your shares in multiple tranches over multiple years, the excludable amount might vary. Reference<a href="https://www.thetaxadviser.com/issues/2018/nov/qualified-small-business-stock-more-attractive.html"> this</a> article for further details.</p>



<p><strong>If you qualify for a QSBS tax exclusion, you are 100% exempt from federal taxes. The current federal tax rate is 23.8% (20% federal + 3.8% medicare). This means you can save 23.8% in long-term capital gains that you would have been subject to otherwise. Depending on which state you live in (</strong><strong><em>not</em></strong><strong> which state the company is incorporated), you may qualify for state-level exclusion as well.</strong> States typically fall into one of four buckets:</p>



<ol><li>States with no individual income tax or no capital gains tax. These states are QSBS compliant by default.</li><li>States that follow the federal tax code and waive state taxes if an individual meets the federal-level QSBS requirements. These states are also QSBS compliant.&nbsp;</li><li>States that have their own QSBS exclusion statues.</li><li>States that do not recognize QSBS in any way, shape, or form (California notably falls in this bucket).&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>I’ve provided a chart of applicable QSBS treatment in each of the 50 states and District of Columbia in the Appendix.</p>



<h2>Requirements for QSBS</h2>



<p><strong>For your stock to qualify as QSBS, you must meet certain requirements at the time of your stock issuance, and others during your entire holding period of the stock. If you sell QSBS, you must report the entire gain as a long-term gain on your Schedule D, and enter the allowable exclusion as a loss below the entry for the gain.</strong></p>



<h3>Requirements that must be met on the date of issuance:</h3>



<ul><li>Corporation issuing the stock must be a domestic C-Corp (and the stock must be issued after August 9, 1993)</li><li>You must acquire your stock directly from the company for money, property, or services. The only exception is if you acquire the stock by gift or inheritance. In this case, you are treated as having acquired the stock in the same manner as the original owner.<ul><li>Note: do not contribute the stock to a family LLC, limited partnership/trust, or to an LLC organized to manage the sale of your stock. This will disqualify the stock as QSBS.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Corporation must have assets of $50M or less at the time you receive your shares (or exercise your options).</strong><ul><li>Note: this is a continuous requirement and if at any point the assets of a corporation exceed $50M, the corporation can never again issue QSBS (even if the assets are below $50M on the date of the subsequent issuance).</li><li>Note: the assets of the corporation must not exceed $50M even after taking into account amounts the corporation received in the current issuance. If, for instance, a company has $40M in the bank and is raising a $20M Series B, none of the newly issued Series B stock will be QSBS.</li></ul></li><li>You must determine your stock issuance date. This is critical for three reasons:<ul><li><strong>Starts the clock for purposes of the five-year holding period requirement. In order to be eligible for the tax exemption outlined above, you must have held on to your stock for a minimum of five years.</strong> If you do not meet this minimum requirement, you can employ a Section 1045 rollover (described below) to extend your holding period.<ul><li><strong>Note: this requirement is yet another reason why you should early exercise your options and file an 83(b). Early exercise allows you to 1) start the one year holding period for long-term capital gains treatment, and 2) start the five year holding period for Section 1202. If you don’t file an 83(b) election, the clock on long-term capital gain only begins when your shares vest – so if there are multiple vesting dates, you will have multiple clocks to monitor for long-term capital gain – and, if eligible, QSBS. An unexercised option or warrant is not considered QSBS, even if the underlying stock would meet the definition of QSBS.</strong></li><li><strong>Note: for stock acquired through the exercise of an option, the company must pass the “$50M asset test” on the date of your exercise, not on the date of your grant.</strong> Similarly, for stock acquired through the vesting of RSUs, the company must pass the “$50M asset test” on vesting, and your five year holding period begins on vesting, not on grant.</li><li>Note: if the stock was received as a gift, inheritance, or as a distribution from a partnership, the acquisition date is the date on which the transferor acquired the stock.</li></ul></li><li>Determines whether gain from the sale of the QSB stock is eligible for a 50%, 75%, or 100% federal tax exclusion.<ul><li>50% federal tax exclusion for stock issued before February 18, 2009</li><li>75% federal tax exclusion for stock issued between February 18, 2009 and September 27, 2010</li><li>100% federal tax exclusion for stock issued after September 27, 2010</li></ul></li><li>Marks the date on which the company must have $50M or less in assets.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul>



<h3>Requirements that must be met during the shareholder’s holding period:</h3>



<ul><li>Corporation must be a C-corp for the entire holding period.</li><li><strong>The corporation must be an “active business” during the entire period you held your stock. This means that at least 80% (by value) of the assets in your corporation must be used to pursue business in industries </strong><strong><em>other</em></strong><strong> than the industries below. Note that if your business provides a service, then it most likely does not qualify as a qualified small business.&nbsp;</strong><ul><li>Health, law, non-software engineering (civil, electrical, etc), architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, consulting, athletics, financial services, or brokerage.</li><li>Banking, insurance, financing, leasing, investing, or similar business.</li><li>Farming.</li><li>Mining or natural resource production or extraction.</li><li>Operating a hotel, restaurant, or similar business.</li></ul></li><li>Cash held for burn requirements generally qualify under this “active business” requirement. However, after two years, technically no more than 50% of the corporation’s assets can qualify under this exemption. While startups usually satisfy this requirement, it isn’t always clear how to apply the rule, especially if the startup retains significant cash following an investment (in other words, overfunded startups sitting on cash). If you’re like most startups and you’re burning cash to fund business operations you will most likely pass this check.</li><li>If the corporation bought back 5% or more of its stock in the year before or after your stock issuance, your stock will not qualify as QSBS.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>Section 1045 Rollover</h2>



<p><strong>In order to be eligible for preferential tax treatment under Section 1202, you must satisfy the requirements above and have held onto your stock for at least five years. If you have not met the five year minimum, however, you can employ a Section 1045 rollover to extend your holding period.</strong></p>



<p><strong>If you have held onto your QSBS for at least six months, you can sell your QSBS and roll the proceeds of the sale into another QSBS issuer without recognizing a gain under Section 1045.</strong> This is a similar concept to a Section 1031 exchange in real estate. <strong>Per Section 1045, you have 60 days from the date of the sale of your original QSBS to roll the sale proceeds into new QSBS.</strong> In general, you should roll all of the proceeds from your sale of original QSBS into the new QSBS. If you take any cash off the table after the initial sale, that amount would be subject to capital gains tax. <strong>The cost basis of the new QSBS is the same as the cost basis of the original QSBS, and the holding period from the original QSBS is counted towards the holding period of the new QSBS.</strong></p>



<p>Consider the following scenario: you acquire 5M shares of QSBS from “Company A” on January 1st, 2010 for $0.00001 per share. Your original cost basis is $50 (5M * $0.00001). Assume you then sell these shares in Company A for $4M on January 1st, 2012, and then reinvest this $4M to purchase 2,000 shares of QSBS in “Company B”. Your holding period will pick up from where it left off and the cost basis for your new shares in Company B will be the same as the original cost basis for your shares in Company A ($50). If you then sell your QSBS in Company B at any point after January 1, …</p></div></div>

  <p>“It’s an old-fashioned thing to say, but I think that occasions of fear are invitations for freedom and for courage.”<br>
<em>—John O’Donohue</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was just before Thanksgiving in 2017 and I was scared. The enormity of the decision I had just made – to leave behind 5 years worth of memories, friendships, and professional networks on the opposite side of the country to move home and run for office – was finally hitting home. I was lonely and afraid. So I decided to drive down to Durham to meet up with a close high school friend I hadn’t seen in a long, long time. After a couple of beers, I confessed my anxiousness. She recommended <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RpKTUDIhXlfXdoZXqt3gBlY0Zvy4_EZY">a lecture by an Irish thinker named John O’Donohue, specifically “Love is the Only Antidote to Fear”</a>. The words hit me like a thunderbolt. Ever since then, whenever I am weighing the pros and cons of a big decision, I make sure to re-listen to this talk.</p>

<p>These are confusing, chaotic, and uncertain times. It is natural to be afraid. I hope this lecture provides some level of comfort to you, just as it has for me throughout the years.</p>

<p>NB: I highly, highly recommend <em>listening</em> to this talk. <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RpKTUDIhXlfXdoZXqt3gBlY0Zvy4_EZY">You can find the link here</a>. O’Donohue is a noted lecturer for a reason, and it’s clear when you hear his highly conversational style in a Celtic lilt that those skills were honed at a lecturn during his years as a parish priest. However, if you prefer to read the text, I have transcribed it below.</p>

<p>Something that everyone has in common is the experience of fear, and the power of the presence of fear. There is no one that could say that they’re not afraid of something. Fear is present in every heart, and science and cultural studies show us that we’re right to be afraid to a level of about 10% in our experience that that corresponds with what’s actually the situation, but that 90% of the fear that we have is unreal. And that’s the haunting loneliness and incredible wastage of what fear does to the human heart.</p>

<p>Fear is the greatest trickster of all. It makes what is real seem unreal and it makes the unreal, real. I always think from nature that the most telling image to correspond to fear is fog. If you’ve ever been out in the mountains and you’ve got caught in fog, you’ll know what I’m talking about. Several years ago, in the mountains at home in the west of Ireland that I know very well, I brought a friend from Manchester for a day on the mountains. And about two hours up in the mountains, the fog came down. I know these mountains really well and we kept going because I told her that I knew where I was going. And about four hours later, we found ourselves exactly back in the place where we were on the fog came down, not knowing where we were. Eventually we got down off the mountains because I was able to hear the ocean and we went in that direction. But that’s what fear does. And your normal experience is that it inflates things and makes something that’s fairly small very, very huge.</p>

<p>Some years ago, I was talking to a friend of mine who is into psychology and psychotherapy about fear. He said that something that he found very helpful when he was afraid was to hold on to one question and stick with it. And the question is to ask yourself, “What is it, exactly, that I’m afraid of?” If you hold to this question, gradually what seems huge and amorphous and beyond your control begins to shrink right down to one moment, one thing that you can actually deal with and handle.</p>

<p>Part of the reason that fear has such power over us is we are vulnerable, and fear draws great strength from time. If you wake up one Monday morning and you realize that on the next Friday that you have something horrible waiting for you, the chances are that your days on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday will be totally shadowed by the threat of Friday, and you waste four lovely days because the fear of what’s waiting for you robs you of the beauty of the days that you have.
Something that I try to do myself when I’m afraid is to sit myself down, and on an empty chair opposite me I’d imagine the thing (or person or situation or whatever) that I was afraid of. Then I’d say to myself, “Let’s do it now. Instead of being miserable about it, let’s have a blast at it.” And then I would imagine, I’d say to myself, “What’s the worst thing that could happen in this situation?” And I’d think about it until I realize what the worst thing was and then I would force myself to imagine all the elements of the worst aspect of it. And then by the time the situation actually arrives, it isn’t too bad at all. You’ll be incredibly relieved cause it’s never as bad as you thought!</p>

<p>One of the questions that’s always haunted me is what is the origin of fear? Why are humans afraid? One of the reasons is that the place we live in the world is in this clay tent of the human body. And it’s a very vulnerable old tent. Because once you’re in a body, you’re always somewhere. You can never successfully hide and you can always be gotten to. You know, like in some of these mafia films, when they go off for a while but somebody always turns up nearly and gets to them? It’s the same thing, but in a human life.</p>

<p>The other thing is that the way that we interpret the world is an incredibly painful and broken and tender way through birth, which was separation. And I always think that humans are really able for anything after successfully coming through the trauma of being born. Because it was loss, separation, alienation. I mean, I often think that’s an image I often use for myself in relation to death. Maybe we have death all wrong because we always think of it as an ending, as closure. A quenching.
But say you turn it the other way around. Say you conducted an interview with the baby in the womb before it was born. And say was a real “with it” baby, the kind that wanted to know what’s going down and you said:</p>

<p>“Okay, baby, you asked for it. You’re going to get it. Here’s the story. In a half an hour you will be expelled from the shelter of the womb where you have emerged and been formed. Secondly, you will come out along a passage (and we all did this) where you will feel that every moment you’re being smothered. Thirdly, you will arrive out into a huge vacancy, probably with merciless light in it. Fourthly, the cord that connects you to the mother heart will be cut. Fifthly, regardless of how close you ever come to anyone in your life afterwards, you will always be on your own. Sixthly, you’re going on a journey for which there is no map. And seventhly, you can’t turn back and eighth, anything can happen to you on the journey.”
Now, if the baby was still breathing at that stage, it would have to conclude, “Jesus, things were really nice and good here and now it looks like I’m going to die,” when in actual fact what’s happening is that has been born. And my suspicion in relation to death is that we only see all the destructive side of it, and that possibly, (I’ll address this bit tomorrow and my talk on beauty), that what’s happening actually in death is that we’re being born again. This time, in a way that the loneliness of space and time no longer has a hold over us.</p>

<p>But I think that if you were to ask, “What is the root of all fear?” the root of all fear is in the fear of death. And I have an old suspicion that if you sort out your fear of death as the worst thing – not something that just might happen to you but that IS going to happen to you – then you remove the soil and the nutrient that nourishes your normal fears.</p>

<p>I used to be very afraid of dying for a long time in my life. And then I became a Roman Catholic priest. And in my years as a priest, one of the immense privileges was to help people to die. And early on in my priesthood there was this woman that I knew. She was a lovely woman, 27 years old. She was a traveler, one of the gypsy people, and she had two children and she was pregnant with a third child when she got leukemia. She was being treated for it though, and it seemed to be working. I was visiting her once a week, and one evening I went in to see her and I was going to give her a hug and she said, “Don’t hug me, I’m bleeding.” And it turned out that the treatment wasn’t working. About four nights later, in the middle of the night, there was a knock at the door of my house. Her family was there and they said, “We’ve got news from the hospital that she’s really bad and we need to go in.” So I talked to the father and mother, and then they all came with their vans and we all went into the hospital. And as soon as I came in the hospital door, I saw the young woman on all these machines and tubes and everything. And she looked up at me, the poor pet, and she said, “Am I going to die?” And I said, “I don’t know whether you’re going to die or not. But when I do, I will tell you.” She said, “Okay.” So then everybody arrived and all the rest of it, and about 4:15 in the morning, she said to me, “Will you open the window?” And something told me that she was going to die. So I went out and I met the house doctor who was on duty and I said, “What’s the story here?” He said, “At 7:30, we are going to bring our downstairs and try one more procedure. But, in actual fact, we expect her to be dead by 10.” So I went back into the room and I said that I wanted some time on my own with her. All the family left and I sat down. I took her hand.</p>

<p>“You’re going to die,” is one of the most awful sentences any human being can ever hear, no matter how sick you are. Sometimes we think when people are sick that they know what’s coming, but they don’t. Because language is an incredible presence. There are some words that are said that are like …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Deep Learning waves have lapped at the shores of computational linguistics for several years now, but 2015 seems like the year when the full force of the tsunami hit the major Natural Language Processing (NLP) conferences.” -<a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/COLI_a_00239">Dr. Christopher D. Manning, Dec 2015</a> <sup id="fnref:part1_1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:part1_1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This may sound hyperbolic - to say the established methods of an entire field of research are quickly being superseded by a new discovery, as if hit by a research ‘tsunami’. But, this catastrophic language is appropriate for describing the meteoric rise of Deep Learning over the last several years - a rise characterized by drastic improvements over reigning approaches towards the hardest problems in AI, massive investments from industry giants such as Google, and exponential growth in research publications (and Machine Learning graduate students). Having taken several classes on Machine Learning, and even used it in undergraduate research, I could not help but wonder if this new ‘Deep Learning’ was anything fancy or just a scaled up version of the ‘artificial neural nets’ that were already developed by the late 80s. And let me tell you, the answer is quite a story - the story of not just neural nets, not just of a sequence of research breakthroughs that make Deep Learning somewhat more interesting than ‘big neural nets’  (that I will attempt to explain in a way that just about anyone can understand), but most of all of how several unyielding researchers made it through dark decades of banishment to finally redeem neural nets and achieve the dream of Deep Learning.</p>

I am certainly not a foremost expert on this topic. In depth technical overviews with long lists of references written by those who actually made the field what it is include Yoshua Bengio's <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/pointeurs/TR1312.pdf">"Learning Deep Architectures for AI"</a>, Jürgen Schmidhuber's <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.7828v4.pdf">"Deep Learning in Neural Networks: An Overview"</a> and LeCun et al.s' <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/NatureDeepReview.pdf">"Deep learning"</a>. In particular, this is mostly a history of research in the US/Canada AI community, and even there will not mention many researchers; a particularly in depth history of the field that covers these omissions is Jürgen Schmidhuber's <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-overview.html">"Deep Learning in Neural Networks: An Overview"</a>. I am also most certainly not a professional writer, and will cop to there being shorter and much less technical overviews written by professional writers such as Paul Voosen's <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-Believers/190147">"The Believers"</a>, John Markoff's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/science/scientists-see-advances-in-deep-learning-a-part-of-artificial-intelligence.html">"Scientists See Promise in Deep-Learning Programs"</a> and Gary Marcus's <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/is-deep-learning-a-revolution-in-artificial-intelligence">"Is “Deep Learning” a Revolution in Artificial Intelligence?"</a>. I also will stay away from getting too technical here, but there is a plethora of tutorials on the internet on all the major topics covered in brief by me.
<br>
Any corrections would be appreciated, though I will note some ommisions are intentional since I want to try and keep this 'brief' and a good mix of simple technical explanations and storytelling.

<p>The beginning of a story spanning half a century, about how we learned to make computers learn. In this part, we shall cover the birth of neural nets with the Perceptron in 1958, the AI Winter of the 70s, and neural nets’ return to popularity with backpropagation in 1986.</p>

</figure>

<p>Let’s start with a brief primer on what Machine Learning is. Take some points on a 2D graph, and draw a line that fits them as well as possible. What you have just done is generalized from a few example of pairs of input values (x) and output values (y) to a general function that can map any input value to an output value. This is known as linear regression, and it is a wonderful little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#cite_note-4">200 year old</a> technique for extrapolating a general function from some set of input-output pairs. And here’s why having such a technique is wonderful: there is an incalculable number of functions that are hard to develop equations for directly, but are easy to collect examples of input and output pairs for in the real world - for instance, the function mapping an input of recorded audio of a spoken word to an output of what that spoken word is.</p>

<p>Linear regression is a bit too wimpy a technique to solve the problem of speech recognition, but what it does is essentially what <strong>supervised Machine Learning</strong> is all about: ‘learning’ a function given a <strong>training set</strong> of <strong>examples</strong>, where each example is a pair of an input and output from the function (we shall touch on the unsupervised flavor in a little while). In particular, machine learning methods should derive a function that can generalize well to inputs not in the training set, since then we can actually apply it to inputs for which we do not have an output. For instance, Google’s current speech recognition technology is powered by Machine Learning with a massive training set, but not nearly as big a training set as all the possible speech inputs you might task your phone with understanding.</p>

<p>This generalization principle is so important that there is almost always a <strong>test set</strong> of data (more examples of inputs and outputs) that is not part of the training set. The separate set can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the machine learning technique by seeing how many of the examples the method correctly computes outputs for given the inputs. The nemesis of generalization is <strong>overfitting</strong> - learning a function that works really well for the training set but badly on the test set. Since machine learning researchers needed means to compare the effectiveness of their methods, over time there appeared standard <strong>datasets</strong> of training and testing sets that could be used to evaluate machine learning algorithms.</p>

<p>Okay okay, enough definitions. Point is - our line drawing exercise is a very simple example of supervised machine learning: the points are the training set (X is input and Y is output), the line is the approximated function, and we can use the line to find Y values for X values that don’t match any of the points we started with. Don’t worry, the rest of this history will not be nearly so dry as all this. Here we go.</p>

<p>Why have all this prologue with linear regression, since the topic here is ostensibly neural nets? Well, in fact linear regression bears some resemblance to the first idea conceived specifically as a method to make machines learn: <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1959-09865-001">Frank Rosenblatt’s <strong>Perceptron</strong></a><sup id="fnref:part1_2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:part1_2">2</a></sup>.</p>

</figure>

<p>A psychologist, Rosenblatt conceived of the Percetron as a simplified mathematical model of how the neurons in our brains operate: it takes a set of binary inputs (nearby neurons), multiplies each input by a continuous valued weight (the synapse strength to each nearby neuron), and thresholds the sum of these weighted inputs to output a 1 if the sum is big enough and otherwise a 0 (in the same way neurons either fire or do not). Most of the inputs to a Perceptron are either some data or the output of another Perceptron, but an extra detail is that Perceptrons also have one special ‘bias’ input, which just has a value of 1 and basically ensures that more functions are computable with the same input by being able to offset the summed value. This model of the neuron built on the work of Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts <a href="http://www.minicomplexity.org/pubs/1943-mcculloch-pitts-bmb.pdf">Mcculoch-Pitts</a><sup id="fnref:part1_3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:part1_3">3</a></sup>, who showed that a neuron model that sums binary inputs and outputs a 1 if the sum exceeds a certain threshold value, and otherwise outputs a 0, can model the basic OR/AND/NOT functions. This, in the early days of AI, was a big deal - the predominant thought at the time was that making computers able to perform formal logical reasoning would essentially solve AI.</p>

    <figcaption>Another diagram, showing the biological inspiration. The <b>activation function</b> is what people now call the non-linear function applied to the weighted input sum to produce the output of the artificial neuron - in the case of Rosenblatt's Perceptron, the function just a thresholding operation.  <a href="http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-1/">(Source)</a> </figcaption>    
</figure>

<p>However, the Mcculoch-Pitts model lacked a mechanism for learning, which was crucial for it to be usable for AI. This is where the Perceptron excelled - Rosenblatt came up with a way to make such artificial neurons learn, inspired by the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.900930310/abstract">foundational work</a><sup id="fnref:part1_4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:part1_4">4</a></sup> of Donald Hebb. Hebb put forth the unexpected and hugely influential idea that knowledge and learning occurs in the brain primarily through the formation and change of synapses between neurons - concisely stated as Hebb’s Rule:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell B and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A’s efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Perceptron did not follow this idea exactly, but having weights on the inputs allowed for a very simple and intuitive learning scheme: given a <strong>training set</strong> of input-output examples the Perceptron should ‘learn’ a function from, for each example increase the weights if the Perceptron output for that example’s input is too low compared to the example, and otherwise decrease the weights if the output is too high. Stated ever so slightly more formally, the algorithm is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start off with a Perceptron having random weights and a training set</li>
  <li>For the inputs of an example in the …</li></ol></div></div>

      <p>As I was writing an article for the first edition of <a href="https://pagedout.institute/">Paged Out</a>,
I had an interesting (albeit too short) conversation regarding
its <a href="https://pagedout.institute/download/PagedOut_001_wallpaper_30.png">cover</a>
with <a href="https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?id=50">Gynvael Coldwind</a>.
Drawn by <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/refiend">ReFiend</a>, it
features two people on the foreground, wielding what looks like guns.
This lead to a discussion on the omnipresence of military jargon, and thus violence,
in the world of computer security. I told him that I'll publish a blogpost 
to correctly articulate my thoughts on the topic, instead of the incoherent
rambling that I served him.</p>
<p>At every single security conference, there is someone with a direct quote of
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War">Art of War</a> on their slide
deck, and there is a metric fuckton of assorted military-inspired bullshit

<p>I understand that it's tempting to compare computer security to war: It takes our daily toil and
raises the stakes, makes us feel that victory is glorious; a battle of the
minds, that our work really matters and is important; and we are united against a common enemy.</p>
<p>But when you think about it, it's absurd: War is something terrible that should be avoided at
almost any cost, a <em>solution</em> of last resort. The worse outcome of
computer-related drama/problems probably doesn't imply entire populations
dying, being tortured, millions of refugees, camps, … Odds are that you won't
save actual lives by deploying a firewall: don't call it a "cyber bulletproof vest deployment".</p>
<p>War justifies terrible behaviours: who cares about you being screamed at when
you're <em>at war</em>? Who cares about your family life, your dinners plans, your hollidays, … when you're <em>at war</em>? What
are broken principles and despicable means, when you're <em>at war</em> ? …
which is a disastrous way to govern and organise a workspace.</p>
<p>Moreover, war maps poorly over computer security. What is a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test">penetration
test</a>"
combat-wise? How do you map "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disclosure_">full disclosure</a>" to war? What is a
"prisoner's camp" or "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpet_bombing">carpet bombing</a>" with a computer (apparently <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/proof-of-concept-carpet-bombing-exploit-released-in-the-wild/">zdnet</a> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/carpet-bombing-ddos-attack-takes-down-south-african-isp-for-an-entire-day/">can</a> )? Rigidly mapping
one onto the other can and will create huge distortions.</p>
<p>Of course, nobody says that computer security stuff actually <em>is</em> war, but
as said in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphors_We_Live_By">Metaphors We Live By </a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lakoff">George Lakoff</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Johnson_(professor)">Mark
Johnson</a>, "Conceptual metaphors shape not just our communication, but also shape
the way we think and act.". Leading to nonsensical bullshit posts like <a href="https://twoscenarios.typepad.com/maneuver_marketing_commun/2005/05/military_metaph.html">this one</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeslifestyle/2012/05/07/plea-for-a-cease-fire-in-business-as-warfare-advice/#f77cce37aa79">entire laughingly stupid books</a>,
and to despicable and hostile work climate.</p>
<p>An other perverse effect is that since military and violent imagery are traditionally, culturally and stereotypically associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_masculinity">toxic masculinity</a>,
this doesn't help with increasing the <a href="https://www.isc2.org/research/women-in-cybersecurity">dramatically low</a> diversity in the computer security sector.</p>
<p>When we think about it, we have way better metaphors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer security as gardening: defending against bugs, growing programs,
     harvesting money, …</li>
<li>Computer security as building a house: everyone wants cosy stuff, yet you
    still need a solid door, maybe a couple of windows as well, definitely solid
    walls, …</li>
<li>Computer security as playing cards: there are adversaries, winning moves,
    gambles, influences, …</li>
<li>Computer security as guarding a museum: priceless artefacts, sneaky attackers
    à la Arsène Lupin, …</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of computer security is to make safer systems, not about waging wars,
and thus shouldn't be envisioned as such. </p>
<p>Of course, if you're working in the military and in infosec, there are overlaps,
but I would argue that this is more about military than it is about computer security.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roybahat">Rob Bahat</a> said in 2016 in his <a href="https://shift.newco.co/2016/11/15/business-is-not-war-lets-stop-talking-like-it-is/">Business Is Not War. Let’s Stop Talking Like It Is.</a> article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Business, at its best, is creation — and war,
always, is destruction. They are opposites, and if we want industry to be a
positive force in our personal lives, environment, society, and future, we
should divorce our language about business from the tragic (if sometimes
necessary) conflicts that bring devastation. There are so many good businesses;
but it is hard to find a good war.</p>

<p>Web Components had so much potential to empower HTML to do more, and make web development more accessible to non-programmers and easier for programmers. Remember how exciting it was every time we got new shiny HTML elements that actually <em>do stuff</em>? Remember how exciting it was to be able to do sliders, color pickers, dialogs, disclosure widgets straight in the HTML, without having to include any widget libraries?</p>



<p>The promise of Web Components was that we’d get this convenience, but for a much wider range of HTML elements, developed much faster, as nobody needs to wait for the full spec + implementation process. We’d just include a script, and boom, we have more elements at our disposal!</p>



<p>Or, that was the idea. Somewhere along the way, the space got flooded by JS frameworks aficionados, who revel in complex APIs, overengineered build processes and dependency graphs that look like the roots of a banyan tree.</p>



<figure><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/2025/32441377780_e3acf6de12_b.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>This is what the roots of a Banyan tree look like. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/79721788@N00/32441377780/">Photo by David Stanley on Flickr (CC-BY)</a>. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Perusing the components on <a href="https://www.webcomponents.org/">webcomponents.org</a> fills me with anxiety, and I’m perfectly comfortable writing JS — I write JS for a living! What hope do those who can’t write JS have? Using a custom element from the directory often needs to be preceded by a ritual of npm flugelhorn, import clownshoes, build quux, all completely unapologetically because “here is my truckload of dependencies, yeah, what”. Many steps are even omitted, likely because they are “obvious”. Often, you wade through the maze only to find the component doesn’t work anymore, or is not fit for your purpose.</p>



<p>Besides setup, the main problem is that HTML is not treated with the appropriate respect in the design of these components. They are not designed as closely as possible to standard HTML elements, but <em>expect</em> JS to be written for them to do anything. HTML is simply treated as a shorthand, or worse, as merely a marker to indicate where the element goes in the DOM, with all parameters passed in via JS. I recall <a href="https://adactio.com/articles/12839#webcomponents">a wonderful talk by Jeremy Keith</a> a few years ago about this very phenomenon, where he discussed <a href="https://shop.polymer-project.org/">this e-shop Web components demo by Google</a>, which is the poster child of this practice. These are the entire contents of its <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element:</p>



<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
	&lt;shop-app unresolved=""&gt;SHOP&lt;/shop-app&gt;
	&lt;script src="node_assets/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-loader.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
	&lt;script type="module" src="src/shop-app.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
	&lt;script&gt;window.performance&amp;&amp;performance.mark&amp;&amp;performance.mark("index.html");&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</code></pre>



<p>If this is how Google is leading the way, how can we hope for contributors to design components that follow established HTML conventions?</p>



<p>Jeremy criticized this practice from the aspect of backwards compatibility: when JS is broken or not enabled, or the browser doesn’t support Web Components, the entire website is blank. While this is indeed a serious concern, my primary concern is one of <strong>usability</strong>: <strong>HTML is a lower barrier to entry language</strong>. Far more people can write HTML than JS. Even for those who do eventually write JS, it often comes after spending years writing HTML &amp; CSS.</p>



<p>If components are designed in a way that requires  JS, this excludes thousands of people from using them. And even for those who <em>can</em> write JS, HTML is often easier: you don’t see many people rolling their own sliders or using JS-based ones once <code>&lt;input type="range"&gt;</code> became widely supported, right?</p>



<p>Even when JS is unavoidable, it’s not black and white. A well designed HTML element can reduce the amount and complexity of JS needed to a minimum. Think of the <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog">&lt;dialog&gt;</a></code> element: it usually does require *some* JS, but it’s usually rather simple JS. Similarly, the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element is perfectly usable just by writing HTML, and has a comprehensive JS API for anyone who wants to do fancy custom things.</p>



<p>The other day I was looking for a simple, dependency free, tabs component. You know, the canonical example of something that is easy to do with Web Components, the example 50% of tutorials mention. I didn’t even care what it looked like, it was for a testing interface. I just wanted something that is small and works like a normal HTML element. Yet, it proved so hard I ended up writing my own!</p>



<h3>Can we fix this?</h3>



<p>I’m not sure if this is a design issue, or a documentation issue. Perhaps for many of these web components, there are easier ways to use them. Perhaps there are vanilla web components out there that I just can’t find. Perhaps I’m looking in the wrong place and there is another directory somewhere with different goals and a different target audience. </p>



<p>But if not, and if I’m not alone in feeling this way, we need a directory of web components with strict inclusion criteria:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Plug and play.</strong> No dependencies, no setup beyond including one <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. If a dependency is absolutely <em>needed</em> (e.g. in a map component it doesn’t make sense to draw your own maps), the component loads it automatically if it’s not already loaded.</li><li>Syntax and API follows <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/02/designing-html-apis/"><strong>conventions established by built-in HTML elements</strong></a> and anything that <em>can</em> be done without the component user writing JS, <em>is</em> doable without JS, per <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html">the W3C principle of least power</a>.</li><li><strong>Accessible by default</strong> via sensible ARIA defaults, just like normal HTML elements.</li><li><strong>Themable</strong> via <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part">::part()</a></code>, selective inheritance and custom properties. Very minimal style by default. Normal CSS properties should just “work” to the the extent possible.</li><li><strong>Only one component of a given type</strong> in the directory, that is <strong>flexible</strong> and <strong>extensible</strong> and continuously iterated on and improved by the community. Not 30 different sliders and 15 different tabs that users have to wade through. No branding, no silos of “component libraries”. Only elements that are designed as closely as possible to what a browser would implement in every way the current technology allows.</li></ul>



<p>I would be up for working on this if others feel the same way, since that is not a project for one person to tackle. <em>Who’s with me?</em></p>



<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Wow this post blew up! Thank you all for your interest in participating in a potential future effort. I’m currently talking to stakeholders of some of the existing efforts to see if there are any potential collaborations before I go off and create a new one. <a href="https://twitter.com/leaverou">Follow me on Twitter to hear about the outcome</a>!</p>

We are coming at you today with a very special episode with Garry Tan of Initialized Fame and before that—Y Combinator, Posterous, and has a long and very illustrious career here in Silicon Valley. We are going to talk about the evolution of early-stage investing.</p><p>Garry has seen it all. I think he started back in the early days when early-stage investing meant a $2 million Series A at a $5 million poster. Maybe that was even high. </p><p>Garry: Yeah, it’s a while.</p><p>David: Goodness, things have changed. I'm so excited to have you here. Thanks for joining us and we can't wait to dive in.</p><p>Garry: Yeah, thank you for having me. Big fan of the show and it means a lot to me that you'd have me.</p><p>David: Likewise that you would come on. Let's just dive right in. We're going to weave in the story of Initialized along the way, but we thought maybe we'd start way back in those prehistoric days of what life is like?</p><p>Garry: So, Arthur Rock.</p><p>David: We've already done that on the Sequoia episodes. Not that far back but when was it that you started Posterous? Was it in 2005?</p><p>Garry: It was 2008, actually. </p><p>David: It was 2008. It’s later than I thought.</p><p>Garry: 2005 I was still at Palantir, so I had just designed the logo for Palantir and built one of the major product teams. Before that, I was Stanford Computer Engineering, and the crazy story for me is that friends of mine were starting a company. And I was the lowest of the low PM at Microsoft.</p><p>Ben: What that’s like?</p><p>Garry: Great place to start, great reach. Friends of mine were starting a company with Peter Thiel. They flew me down to San Francisco to have dinner with Peter right when he wrote the $500,000 check to Facebook. He said, “Garry, what are you doing at Microsoft? You're wasting your time.” I said, “I wanted to work at a startup, but they weren't startups in 2003, 2004.”</p><p>He said, “I'm so sure this is the right thing. You need to quit your job.” He asked me how much a year I made. I told him it was $70,000. He said, “Well, how about this? I'll write you a personal check from my bank account to yours. This is your risk opportunity. Quit your job.” I said, “Thank you very much, Mr. Thiel, but I might make it to level 60 next year,” and I got on a plane and went back to Seattle. That company turned into Palantir. </p><p>David: Oh my gosh.</p><p>Garry: I ended up joining a year later, they had hired away some of my closest friends who were way smarter than me. Bob McGrew, who now runs stuff over at OpenAI. Just so many smart people you get to meet in Silicon Valley over time. Once they hired away people smarter than, I was like, I need to quit my job at Microsoft. At the moment, when your friends are starting a business and you don't know anything about startups, tech, or how these things are funded. You say, well, I have a real job, and you say no.</p><p>David: We're talking about this with Kevin and Julia Hartz on the Eventbrite episode. I imagine you're right out of college. Your parents were probably (if you even told them about this) like, no way would they let you do this.</p><p>Garry: They’re like don’t do it. That seems unsafe. Yeah. The immigrant mentality for sure.</p><p>Ben: Garry, that's an amazing story, and it is absolutely one of survivorship bias because I want to share my story. I had a friend who was starting a YC Company. I had just moved to Seattle, and I was about to start my job at Microsoft. This friend lobbied and lobbied and lobbied. They’d come and get me to co-found the company with them.</p><p>For years, it looked like a huge mistake that I said, are you kidding me? I'd have to give back my signing bonus. I just moved here. This person told me something very similar that they would help definitely pay back the signing bonus. [...] your risk thing, they’d pay for my move. But as years have gone by, that company sold for exactly the preference. It would have been completely awash.</p><p>Garry: Yeah. That's tough.</p><p>Ben: For a while I was like, wow, that's one of several examples in my life where I really blew it on joining something early. Sometimes, not that my choice was the right choice, but unless it's Peter Thiel calling, the story doesn't always end the way you’re—</p><p>Garry: Yeah. These things are crazy risky. I often think about, wow, he was willing to pay that much upfront for an engineer. The rest of my career—even as an investor today—is now actually the inversion of that. Which is now I realize actually, it's the software engineers, designers, product people, and the builders who create the future. That's why we're able to do early-stage at all is that we look a lot more like them at that stage and so they'll pick us.</p><p>On the flip side, because I can still code a little bit and I still do design. I'm probably better at marketing now than I was 10 years ago.</p><p>David: You've diversified your skillset.</p><p>Garry: Yeah. That's right. We look more like them. Then that's the cool thing. I think that fits with the overall series. It's like we're talking about the traitorous eight—sending real typewritten letters across the country to financiers who were totally different from them. Now, what we're talking about—what you guys do and what we're doing—is we're no different. I think that time was for venture capitalists to say we're set apart, we're different.</p><p>David: We're in this ivory tower.</p><p>Garry: Yeah. The ivory tower is different. There's actually a ritualistic aspect that I was talking with Geoff Lewis at Bedrock. He has this theory that is really interesting. There is something to be said for I'm walking up the steps of Sequoia, this is what legends before me did, and I can be a part of that.</p><p>Now it's Zoom. If anything, now it's flipped. Now it's about the one on one conversation that you can have right here. That's why you have the rise of influencer investing. I know, we'll talk about it later, but that's part of the reason why I think YouTube is so important, for me anyway. I'm investing very deeply into it because I think it's a very interesting innovation in the course of how ventures are created.</p><p>David: VCs historically take a long time to catch on. YouTube was founded right around this time that we're talking about, and here we are in 2020 and people only just were starting to catch on.</p><p>Garry: 2005, yeah.</p><p>Ben: Garry, you talked about your time as a builder, and we're going to put a pin in this influencer investing and definitely come back to it because I think it'll be a nice way to round out the full story. Take us through founding Posterous, leaving Palantir, how you raised money for that, and how you went about getting enough proof that there's a there, there to invest more of your time.</p><p>Garry: There's nothing quite like seeing a super early-stage startup for your own eyes. Actually, I've always been really thankful for my time working with Stephen Cohen, Joe Lonsdale, and Alex Karp—just the founders of Palantir. Being able to build software from scratch. The more subtle interesting thing that I feel like I learned was how important it is to basically continue to hire people way smarter than you actually.</p><p>The cult making and the mythmaking of the startup very early are really underplayed. I don't feel like people talk about it enough, and Palantir, I think remains very good at it. The only cult that was stronger than our cult was the Facebook cult (I think). But it's interesting to see. Years later, that's an order of magnitude bigger as a company, which is fascinating to me. I think that actually is directly proportional. How strong your cult will result in how big your company ends up being.</p><p>Assuming you're in the right market and 10 other things that you need to survive. You need to be one of those survivors. A lot of things have to break your way.</p><p>Ben: What's an example of something that was done at Palantir to help build that cult brand?</p><p>Garry: Honestly, I think the simplest thing was even just trying to get the smartest, most capable, and hardworking people, which sounds really stupid simple. It seems like everyone should do that, but honestly, people just don't. When you think about hiring, the mistake that a lot of founders make—and honestly, I made this mistake at some level too when I worked on Posterous—was who can I get? And that's the wrong question.</p><p>You should start with who is the smartest person I know, and it doesn't matter where they're at. Because if I get them, then our self-fulfilling prophecy becomes destiny. If I don't, then it doesn't. I'm not doing myself or them a favor by not going after them. We would just go. </p><p>People would pass out yellow legal pads, and we would force everyone to step away from their computers, and it'd be like, write down the names of 20 people who were the smartest people you've ever met in any walk of life. It didn't have to be engineering, design, or whatever. It was just, who are the smartest people you know in your life. We take it into a backroom and cross-reference it and then those are like our hit list. It's like let's go get those people. We're going to take them to dinner, we're going to take them to lunch, we're going to meet them, we're going to chop down the tree, and we're going to go get them.</p><p>David: That mindset leads to doing things like what Peter offered to you. I can't believe I've never thought of that before. Yeah, you were ungettable. You were at Microsoft, but what if you just offered to personally cover the gap in your salary? It didn't work for you then, but a certain number of people, that's going to work with. And if you're not in that mindset of okay, I don't even go to try to get this person. Well then, you don't know, but once you're like, no, I'm going to try and get them. Well, what can I do?</p><p>Garry: Yeah. It just compounds from there because smart people want to work with smart people. I think that is testament and credit to what they've been able to build over the years. That becomes a self-fulfilling …</p></div></div>

        <p>Back when I first learnt tmux, I realized it was a really valuable tool. Soon
afterwards, I found myself in need of wanting to make a split only to find out
I wasn’t in tmux. This would lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Killing the running process.</li>
<li>Starting tmux.</li>
<li>Restarting the previous process.</li>
</ul>
<p>In pursuit of an ideal solution, I added a tiny script in my scripts directory
which was called by my bashrc.</p>
<h2 id="current-workflow">Current Workflow<a href="#current-workflow" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>My current workflow simply starts by opening the terminal. Instead of the bash
prompt, I am greeted by this.</p>
<pre><code>Choose the terminal to attach:
1 - 12: 3 windows (created Wed Sep 30 14:26:37 2020) (attached)
2 - tana: 3 windows (created Wed Sep 30 18:17:24 2020) (attached)
3 - userbot: 1 windows (created Tue Sep 29 18:37:19 2020)
4 - ytc: 1 windows (created Tue Sep 29 18:37:19 2020)

Create a new session by entering a name for it
</code></pre><p>At this point, I either</p>
<ul>
<li>enter a number (in this case from 1 to 4) to connect to an existing session.</li>
<li>enter a name to create a named tmux session.</li>
<li>hit enter (or C-D) to create an unnamed session (tmux will name it
sequentially).</li>
<li>type nil and hit enter to drop to shell without starting tmux</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation<a href="#implementation" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>In my <code>.bashrc</code>, live these lines.</p>

<span>fi</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Although I use vim as my sole editor, I needed to demo something in VSCode and
for that case I have added an exception so that the script does not run the
<code>tmux_chooser</code> in VSCode’s integrated terminal.</p>
<p>Here is the source of <code>tmux_chooser</code> called above.</p>

<h2><a id="intro" name="intro">INTRO</a></h2>

<p>The vast majority of people on earth argue in a <em>destructive </em>fashion. Debates, especially in online spaces, are viewed as a battle of the wits in which egos are put on display and there can be only one "winner".</p>

<p>Instead, we should be arguing in a <em>constructive </em>fashion: treating arguments as an opportunity to expand knowledge, finding points of disagreement, and collaborating towards a common truth.</p>

<p>I have a confession to make: I used to be a destructive arguer. When I was younger, my goal in any argument was not to learn something new, but rather to assure my superiority over what I felt to be the clear stupidity of the other side. I even used to save screenshots of debates I had on various forums and social media platforms, returning periodically to reminisce about past skirmishes in which I "<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/trigger-the-libs">owned the conservatives</a>".</p>

<p>Luckily, several years spent abroad gave me a different perspective. I realized that in the small-sided debates I used to engage in back home, my positions lacked the nuance and context of the greater world. For the first time, I began to do deep research on how to think — and argue — &nbsp;more clearly, drawing from concepts from philosophy, psychology, and behavioral economics.</p>

<p>This widened outlook led me to see arguments as a chance to build value, rather than destroy it. Instead of going through the mental anguish of battle, I now follow a collaborative approach to debate that I'd like to share in this guide in hopes that it will inspire others to argue more constructively.</p>

<p>Note that the content in this guide will focus on arguments about public issues, like politics and religion, as opposed to personal issues, like "you need to communicate more" or "you haven't done the dishes in weeks". Though there is overlap between the two, interpersonal arguments are much more complex and require more nuance than this guide can provide, plus there are already a ton of great resources out there that explore these topics more thoroughly.</p>

<h2><a id="mindset" name="mindset">MINDSET</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span><em>&nbsp;"An argument should be a collaboration between two people to find the truth."</em></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I had to distill this guide down to one sentence, it would be the above. Even if you forget the individual tenets and strategies this guide has to offer, as long as you are treating any given argument as a collaboration in search of truth, you can't go wrong.</p>

<p>Arguing more effectively requires detaching yourself from the idea of "winning" in the traditional sense. Instead, you should declare victory when you have argued in good faith and kept an open mind.</p>

<p>True collaboration requires that both parties open an investigation into why they may be wrong and consider changing their beliefs. Which brings us to the three core tenets of a constructive debate mindset:</p>

<h3>Acknowledge You May Be Wrong, and Be Willing to Change Your Mind <a href="#Acknowledge You May Be Wrong, and Be Willing to Change Your Mind" id="Acknowledge You May Be Wrong, and Be Willing to Change Your Mind" name="Acknowledge You May Be Wrong, and Be Willing to Change Your Mind"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></h3>

<p>Was there ever a time in which you had a deeply-held belief about something, but slowly came to realize that you were wrong? Maybe you thought a past partner was "the one", or you were devoted to a religious faith. Or perhaps something as simple as believing in Santa Claus.</p>

<p>What's to say that couldn't happen with the rest of your deeply-held beliefs, given enough evidence?</p>

<p>Go into every debate with the mindset that you may not know everything about the topic at hand, and in fact <em>may be wrong</em>.</p>

<p>If you successfully acknowledge that you may be wrong, it follows that you must then be willing to change your mind. Having the humility to admit that your mind has been changed is one of the most honorable positions in a good faith debate.</p>

<h3>Arguments Are Not Soldiers <a href="#Arguments Are Not Soldiers" id="Arguments Are Not Soldiers" name="Arguments Are Not Soldiers"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></h3>

<p>In a war, all soldiers take an oath to fight for their own side, no matter what amount they agree with its principles. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f/politics-is-the-mind-killer">Eliezer Yudkowsky once observed</a> that in political debates, arguments were treated like soldiers: "<em>Once you know which side you're on, you must support all arguments of that side, and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side; otherwise it's like stabbing your soldiers in the back.</em>"</p>

<p>Because most people go into debate with a war-like mentality, they feel they must fly the flag for all points that <em>their</em><em> side</em> supports, regardless of how much they actually agree with them.</p>

<p>The red state gun-owner must be pro-religion, anti-abortion, anti-drugs, anti-tax, and skeptical of gender issues.</p>

<p>The blue state Subaru-owner must be anti-religion, pro-abortion, pro-drugs, pro-tax(ing-the-rich), and concerned about gender issues.</p>

<p>Most annoying is that given the societal expectations for this divide, being for or against one issue immediately assigns you to a "side" in the views of everyone involved. Breaking out of this Arguments as Soldiers mindset involves two steps:</p>

<p>1. Do not be afraid to agree with the arguments of the other side when they strike you as reasonable, and critique the arguments of your own side when they strike you as unreasonable (better yet, try not to have a side).</p>

<p>2. On the flip side, avoid stereotyping your debate partner based on one opinion. If you are engaging with someone in debate for the first time, assume that they agree with you on every other position than the one they are defending, until proven otherwise.</p>

<h3>There's Always Someone Who Thinks the Jedi Are Evil <a href="#There's Always Someone Who Thinks the Jedi Are Evil" id="There's Always Someone Who Thinks the Jedi Are Evil" name="There's Always Someone Who Thinks the Jedi Are Evil"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></h3>

<p><em>Brace yourself, Star Wars references incoming:</em></p>

<p>In a given debate, almost everyone thinks they are a member of the Jedi order, fighting for all that is virtuous and good in the universe. Yet for every Jedi, there's a Sith out there <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llLKar19XhA">who thinks that the Jedi are evil</a> and wrong and that <em>they</em> are actually the ones fighting for virtue and good. Remember that this person might even be <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, you are not a full agent of good, and your debate partner is not an agent of evil, or vice versa. You are simply citizens of the galaxy who happen to be operating with different sets of information. Look at the situation from a different perspective: if you were raised with Sith beliefs from childhood, don't you think you might believe the exact same things a Sith would?</p>

<p>In debate, your goal should not be to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMNKwZTv1d0">strike down the side of evil with all your hatred</a>, but rather work together with them to uncover the true facts about the universe, and in doing so perhaps change both your perspectives.</p>

<h2><a id="mindset" name="prework">PRE-WORK</a></h2>

<p>It would be great if choosing to pursue the path of arguing constructively was just a matter of changing your mindset overnight, but as Carl Sagan once said: <a href="https://youtu.be/BkHCO8f2TWs?t=9">"If you wish to bake an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe."</a></p>

<p>In the same vein, if you wish to improve the constructiveness of the debates you engage in, you must first spend time re-inventing your entire mind.</p>

<p>This is because our mind is constantly working against us, plagued by ancient errors from the times in which we lived in caves and hunted woolly mammoths. These errors work against us in the form of cognitive biases and logical fallacies, which hinder our ability to clearly see reality and engage in sound debate.</p>

<h3>Recognize and Avoid Cognitive Biases <a href="#Recognize and Avoid Cognitive Biases" id="Recognize and Avoid Cognitive Biases" name="Recognize and Avoid Cognitive Biases"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></h3>

<p>Cognitive biases are limits and mistakes in human judgement that prevent someone from acting rationally. They are present in every aspect of human life, and in tense situations like arguments, they tend to appear more often as emotions are heightened and the brain gets overloaded.</p>

<p>Common examples that relate to debates are <em>confirmation bias</em>, or the tendency of humans to seek out information that confirms existing beliefs, and <em>ingroup bias</em>, or the tendency to agree more strongly with people that appear to be part of our "tribe", but there are over 100 identified biases, and it's worth reading through the Wikipedia article on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">most common cognitive biases</a> so you can recognize when they might be clouding your thinking.</p>

<h3>Recognize and Avoid Logical Fallacies <a href="#Recognize and Avoid Logical Fallacies" id="Recognize and Avoid Logical Fallacies" name="Recognize and Avoid Logical Fallacies"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></h3>

<p>In part caused by cognitive biases, logical fallacies are errors in argument that give off an air of decisiveness, despite making points that don't hold up to logical scrutiny. While these are often used unintentionally, due to bias, carelessness, or ignorance, unfortunately, they can also be wielded intentionally by a shrewd debate partner.</p>

<p>Common examples in debate include the <em>false dilemma fallacy</em>: "you're either with us or against us", and the <em>slippery slope fallacy</em>: "if we allow the gays to marry, what's next: plants?" Just like cognitive biases, there are a large number of identified logical fallacies, and it's worth it to review the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies">entire list</a>, so you can spot them in your own arguments and in those of others.</p>

<h2><a id="debatebreakdown" name="debatebreakdown">BREAKING DOWN A DEBATE</a></h2>

<p>To the untrained eye, a debate might look like two or more parties trading argumentative points back and forth. But interestingly, these points can almost perfectly be classified into a few categories. Understanding these categories, and why some types of arguments are better than others, is crucial for learning how we and those whom we engage with in debate might shape their points. In a brilliant post called <em><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/08/varieties-of-argumentative-experience/">Varieties of Argumentative Experience</a></em>, Scott Alexander does just this, illuminating and labeling practically every part of a debate. The post itself is basically required reading, but is long-ish<em>,</em> so I will summarize here.</p>

<p>Think of a debate as a pyramid: <a href="#debatepyramid" id="debatepyramid" name="debatepyramid"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></p>

<p><img alt="" height="548" src="http://liamrosen.com/Pyramid%20of%20Argumentative%20Experience.svg" width="978"></p>

<p>In general, the lower on the pyramid you are, the worse debate you're having. The goal should be to start as high as possible and continue to work your way towards the top.</p>

<p>Debates on twitter and other forms of social media are almost guaranteed to never rise above the lower dotted line, as these platform don't allow for more nuanced debate. Everything above the higher dotted line is our gold standard: two intelligent, charitable, and versed debaters can successfully maintain a debate at this level until some form of resolution.</p>

<p>The blue side represents the discussion …</p></div></div>

<p>Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert, <a href="https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html">wrote</a> about how to reach the top:</p>



<blockquote><p>If you want something extraordinary, you have two paths:</p><p>1. Become the best at one specific thing.<br>2. Become good (top 25%) at two or more things.</p><cite>Scott Adams (<a href="https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html">source</a>)</cite></blockquote>



<p>Number one, he says, is as good as impossible but number two is easy. </p>



<p>It’s called <strong>Skill Stacking</strong>. I went down the rabbit hole and found <a href="https://forge.medium.com/how-to-become-the-best-in-the-world-at-something-f1b658f93428">this excellent post</a> with this image:</p>

<p>See that little fella in the middle there? That’s the sweet spot. </p>



<p>I will never be the best in the world at running or programming or writing or agile process. But I can be in the top 25% of each. If I can find a way to combine two or more of them, then I can be the best at that combination. </p>



<p>I could build an audiobook reader app specifically for runners. I could create a niche blog for programmers who run. I could apply for Strava’s engineering team. I could write a book on how to apply agile principles to running. </p>



<p>Here’s another example, plucked from a random Hacker News comment:</p>



<blockquote><p>I learned this lesson from Clifford Stoll. He said that astronomers figure he must be an exceptional programmer, since he’s clearly a mediocre astronomer. While programmers figure he must be an exceptional astronomer, since his programming is strictly middle-of-the-road!</p><cite><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24263882">samatman on HN</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Of course, there are different types of skills. You’ll have trouble combining some skills, but others are universal. Public speaking, writing, marketing, programming, charisma; these can stack with almost anything. Scott Adams says this about public speaking:</p>



<blockquote><p>I always advise young people to become good public speakers (top 25%). Anyone can do it with practice. If you add that talent to any other, suddenly you’re the boss of the people who have only one skill.</p><cite>Scott Adams</cite></blockquote>



<p>It’s a fun thought experiment. List the things you’re pretty good at, and brainstorm ways to combine 2 or more of them. What do you come up with?</p>

September 30, 2020 | https://parametricity.com/posts/2020-power/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://parametricity.com/posts/2020-power/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>Recently there was a minor controversy over a blogpost from Coinbase’s <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804">CEO</a>
discouraging employees from thinking about politics, and encouraging them to focus on profit-making.
I really appreciated this post, because I think it can be very clarifying for those employees who think their
company can be a pure force for good. The Coinbase blogpost gives the honest truth that in the final calculus,
corporations whose primary goal is profit-maximization can only incidentally and in small ways advance any other
aim.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is a lot of promise for good in the actual technology underlying the crypto industry. This post will argue</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>If work is organized through for-profit corporations, there will be strong pressure from management and capital to
distort positive aspects of the technology in favor of profit-making</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>naive utopianism</strong> which has sustained the industry so far and helped produce some good technology <strong>is no match for this pressure</strong></li>
<li><strong>The only realistic way to combat this</strong> distorting pressure and focus on the socially-beneficial aspects of the technology <strong>is for workers</strong>
(the other human factor of production apart from management and capitalists) <strong>to use their collective power to push back</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This argument is not surprisingly somewhat controversial among executives and VCs, but happily that same group loves
free speech and hates cancel-culture, so I assume I will not be attacked for expressing it.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-web-and-what-should-it-be">What is the web and what should it be?</h2>
<p>What should the web be? It should be a medium for personal communication, organization for people in projects, art and creative expression, etc. that is oriented around the goals of individual and collective flourishing. That would be ideal.</p>
<p>In reality, it is not operated that way. It – like almost everything in our society – is operated as a profit-extraction machine in the service of a small group of people.
This machine started off performing the above functions (of course, already distorted by its origins as a technology for the military and academia).
Soon, an industry of for-profit companies sprung up around developing the internet. Many of these companies became large enough to have a decisive influence on what the web would be.</p>
<p>As the years went by, the parts of it that did not contribute much to profit generation (like weird personal websites) were scrapped under the influence of these companies,
and new pieces which enhanced profit generation were added. It happened this way because there is enormous pressure from management and investors to focus on profit-generation
to the exclusion of all else.</p>
<p>Of course, because these modifications were made primarily in pursuit of profit with other reasons being secondary, this resulted in a bunch of unintended (or un-“cared about”) negative consequences like</p>
<ul>
<li>creepy data-collection and surveillance which is used to manipulate us into buying things</li>
<li>right-wing radicalization which has resulted in widespread political violence</li>
<li>distribution of misinformation</li>
<li>an enormous carbon footprint</li>
<li>collective billions in wasted minutes spent scrolling because we were tricked by the algorithm to stay on just a bit longer</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these things are natural results of a system that cannot “see” the concept of social good and can only see profits.
These problems just do not matter to the system, and only could in the event that they interfered with profit-generation.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-push-back">How to push back</h2>
<p>Let’s say you are a worker at a crypto company who sees this history and want to make sure that in crypto, socially useful aspects of
the technology are prioritized rather than those that make the most profit. What should you do?</p>
<p>First, I think it is necessary to deal with the most popular response, which is a utopian faith that the decentralized
nature of some crypto technology will inherently stop bad things from happening.</p>
<h3 id="crypto-utopianism">Crypto-utopianism</h3>
<p>There’s a lot of utopianism in crypto. This ranges from the lowest Bitcoin-booster all the way up to people like Vitalik.</p>
<p>This quote is somewhat <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/this-political-conversation-with-vitalik-buterin-shows-how-ethereum-could-change-the-world">examplary</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These three white men talked about the protests erupting across the United States. To his credit, the Russian-Canadian Buterin spoke broadly instead of attempting to comment on inequality in American politics. He said the current generation is facing a global “crisis of legitimacy,” concerning both corporations and “many types of governments.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The challenge here is can we create systems that allow some groups of people to cooperate without that downside of a centralized or trusted actor having to be in the middle,” Buterin said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crypto-utopianism usually includes a suggestion that crypto will replace existing systems (which are bad because they’re “centralized” or some other vague reason) and be better because they are “decentralized” (whatever that might mean).</p>
<p>These analyses give crypto projects a sense of grandeur and importance which is motivating to developers and investors alike. Unfortunately, if your goal is to push back against the existing profit-maximizing power structures, you need to have a better analysis than “centralized bad, decentralized good”. It sounds good, but it doesn’t actually constitute a plan to defeat the Facebooks of the world or even to resist pressure from investors.</p>
<p>The crypto-utopian prescription for all that ails the web is some new technology.
Technology is great and a necessary part of the puzzle, but unless Glenn Weyl has a way of forcing Facebook to use quadratic voting for corporate governance, it’s not useful yet.
<strong>The existing power structure can always pick-and-choose the new technology that best advances its goals.</strong>
If you have goals which are distinct from theirs, you need to build power that is capable of a serious challenge.</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-power-do-they-have">What kind of power do they have?</h3>
<p>What kind of power does the existing “power structure” consisting of senior management and capitalists have?
It has</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20983053/google-fires-four-employees-memo-rebecca-rivers-laurence-berland-union-busting-accusation-walkout">the ability to fire people</a> that won’t comply with its goals</li>
<li>the ability to withhold funding from companies that won’t comply with its goals (this is kind of another version of the previous)</li>
<li><a href="https://parametricity.com/posts/2020-power/news.ycombinator.com">public platforms</a> to spread <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804">messaging that argues in favor of its goals</a></li>
<li>control of platforms which allows them to <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/on-facebook-banning-anarchist-and-antifascist-pages-the-digital-censorship-to-come/">censor unfavorable currents in the culture at large</a></li>
<li>endless legal resources to neutralize those that won’t comply with its goals</li>
<li>in some cases, relationships with law enforcement that can be used against those that won’t comply with its goals
and surely much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Profit-maximization is the “prime directive” of the existing power structure and as a result challenging it inevitably provokes a fight.
This fight is usually waged (on their end) by making use of all the above tools and more.</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-power-do-you-have">What kind of power do you have?</h3>
<p>What kind of power do you, a worker at a crypto company, have to resist all of the above? On your own, basically none. If you
make too much trouble, you will simply be fired and then you’re out of luck. Some small number of people can try starting a company (which I have done)
but you’re still subject to some of the same kinds of retaliation as funding can be withheld, which either “fires” the company or redirects
it toward whatever profit-maximization opportunity is available. And even if you have an independent revenue stream, you will be competing
against firms that are willing to do whatever it takes to maximize profits.</p>
<p>As a group however, workers have an enormous amount of power. It is sometimes considered controversial to say so, but VCs and senior
management cannot actually do anything without workers. As such, if workers organize together into a strong company or industry-wide union,
they can make demands of the existing power structure and refuse to participate in the production process (i.e., strike) if those demands are not met.
This power can be augmented with legal resources, platforms of their own, etc.</p>
<p>If you are interested in building power with your fellow workers to advance your own goals rather than those of the profit-maximizers,
both within your company and across your industry, I recommend reaching out to <a href="https://techworkerscoalition.org/">Tech Workers Coalition</a>
who can provide further guidance. You can also get in touch with or <a href="https://act.dsausa.org/donate/membership2020">join your local DSA</a> to
build your analysis, help push more broadly for a world beyond profit maximization, and get support.</p>

September 30, 2020 | https://without.boats/blog/revisiting-a-smaller-rust/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://without.boats/blog/revisiting-a-smaller-rust/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<p>A bit over a year ago, I wrote some <a href="https://without.boats/blog/notes-on-a-smaller-rust">notes on a “smaller Rust”</a> - a higher level language
that would take inspiration from some of Rust’s type system innovations, but would be simpler by
virtue of targeting a domain with less stringent requirements for user control and performance.
During my time of unemployment this year, I worked on sketching out what a language like that would
look like in a bit more detail. I wanted to write a bit about what new conclusions I’ve come to
during that time.</p>
<h2 id="the-purpose-for-our-language">The purpose for our language</h2>
<p>Re-reading my previous post, I’m struck by how vague my statement of purpose for this language is.
My entire blog post is really focused on differentiating the language from <em>Rust</em>, and I frame the
discussion in terms of what I would remove from Rust, and how the language would not support certain
use cases of Rust. This isn’t really surprising: I was working on Rust, and I never had taken the
time to think of this hypothetical language in itself the way I have now.</p>
<p>The goal of this design was to create a language that could compete as an “application programming
language.” The design goals of this language were:</p>
<ol>
<li>It should try not to be notably hard to learn. To the extent possible, it should be familiar to
most programmers. Since I’m comitting by the exercise to trying to apply ownership and borrowing
to the application domain, it will necessarily contain some features most programmers find
pretty novel (like Rust “lifetimes”). But in general, we will try to reduce the onboarding ramp
and simplify things.</li>
<li>It should typecheck and compile quickly. It should not have bad batch compilation performance,
and it should be designed with incremental recompilation in mind, to enable a good experience for
users who integrate their compiler into their development environment (with a full IDE or even
just with a plugin for a text editor). I didn’t even mention this concern in the previous post.
As others have discussed elsewhere; Rust’s poor compile times are not the result of its advanced
type system, but of a combination of other factors. Some are essential, like the runtime
guarantees it makes (e.g. monomorphization) whereas others are accidental, like some aspects of
its module system. None of these factors would be essential for our language, so we would
carefully avoid these pitfalls.</li>
<li>It should have a runtime which suits it well to the major use cases for application programming
languages today. This means mainly being well suited to the developing for the web, both
front-end and back-end. (Being well-suited to the mobile platforms is unrealistic for a language
not sponsored by those platform developers, unfortunately.) Being well-suited to CLIs would also
be beneficial.</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to focus the rest of this post on my thoughts for evolving Rust’s ownership and borrowing
system, but before I do that I want to briefly touch on other design decisions that fell out of this
thought process:</p>
<ul>
<li>I would target WASM, and only WASM, for this language. WASM with reference types is suitable as
an environment for application programming (with shims for future extensions like properly
integrated garbage collection). This way the language designers can piggy back on the work being
done at many companies to establish WASM as a good shared VM platform, instead of being
responsible for things like platform compatibility or using the very slow LLVM. Targeting WASM
would also mean easier FFI integration into other languages that run on the same VM as WASM; that
is, other languages targeting WASM (like Rust) and JavaScript.</li>
<li>I would explore control-flow-capturing closures as a core language abstraction, similar to Kotlin.
As I wrote in <a href="https://without.boats/blog/the-problem-of-effects">an earlier blog post</a> inspired by the design on this hypothetical
language, I think these are a great way to integrate effects well with higher order function
abstractions.</li>
<li>I would provide syntactic sugar for <code>Result</code> and <code>Option</code> as the way to handle null and errors,
similar to Swift.</li>
<li>As I wrote in a previous blog post, I would provide green threads as the sole concurrency model,
with language or standard library provided channels and cells (discussed later) as the way of
sharing data between threads. How these green threads are mapped to CPUs is a matter for the
runtime you choose to run the compiled WASM in.</li>
<li>I didn’t get to the point of designing a polymorphism system; I would probably start with a
strenuous comparison of Rust’s traits and Go’s interfaces, and (knowing the other features of the
language) try to figure out what from Rust’s traits is unimportant.</li>
<li>I would be hope the language could avoid macros, which (in the case of pattern based macros) add a
second meta language to the language that advanced users need to understand, and in all cases
substantially complicate compilation.</li>
</ul>

<p>But now onto the meat of this post: the ownership and borrowing model. In my previous post I made
some points that I largely agree with still, but would probably reframe. Here’s what I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust works because it enables users to write in an imperative programming style, which is the
mainstream style of programming that most users are familiar with, while avoiding to an impressive
degree the kinds of bugs that imperative programming is notorious for. As I said once, pure
functional programming is an ingenious trick to show you can code without mutation, but Rust is an
even cleverer trick to show you can just have mutation.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><strong>Resource acquisition is initialization:</strong> Objects should manage conceptual resources like file
descriptors and sockets, and have destructors which clean up resource state when the object goes
out of scope. It should be trivial to be confident the destructor will run when the object goes
out of scope. This necesitates most of ownership, moving, and borrowing.</p>
<p><strong>Aliasable XOR mutable:</strong> The default should be that values can be mutated only if they are not
aliased, and there should be no way to introduce unsynchronized aliased mutation. However, the
language should support mutating values. The only way to get this is the rest of ownership and
borrowing, the distinction between borrows and mutable borrows and the aliasing rules between
them.</p>
<p>In other words, the core, commonly identified “hard part” of Rust - ownership and borrowing - is
essentially applicable for any attempt to make checking the correctness of an imperative program
tractable. So trying to get rid of it would be missing the real insight of Rust, and not building
on the foundations Rust has laid out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I still think this is Rust’s “secret sauce” and it does mean what I said: the language would have to
have ownership and borrowing. But what I’ve realized since is that there’s a very important
distinction between the cases in which users <em>want</em> these semantics and the cases where they largely
get in the way. This distinction is between types which represent <em>resources</em> and types which
represent <em>data</em>.</p>
<p>In this mental model, resources are types which represent “a thing” - something with an identity and
a state which can change with time as the program executes. In Rust, almost everything is a
resource: a String is a resource a HashMap is a resource, most user types are resources. In
contrast, data types are just “information” - a fact, which has no meaningful identity, contains no
state that evolves over time, etc. In Rust, types like integers, <code>&amp;str</code>, and so on - which all
implement <code>Copy</code> - are data types. (However, a mutable reference to those types is a resource: more
on this later.)</p>
<p>In Rust, only types which can be cloned by a mempcy can implement <code>Copy</code>. This is because Rust is
designed to encourage treating all heap memory as a <em>resource</em>, the management of which the end
user can control by selecting when the type representing that memory is dropped. This is very
valuable in the domains which Rust is intended to target. However, for higher level applications
that most programmers write, control over heap memory is not <em>usually</em> important. This is what users
mean when they want to “turn off the borrow checker” - they want to let a garbage collector figure
it out for them when this bit of data is freed, because to them it is “just data” and not a
resource.</p>
<p>This hypothetical language would lean into that distinction. Using persistent data structures (like
those from Clojure) and garbage collection, the set of types which could be treated as data types
would not be restricted in this language. The string type would be a data type, rather than
a resource; a dynamically sized array of data types would be a data type as well, as would a map
with keys and values that are data types.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, types representing IO objects would always be resource types. Collections containing
resource types would also be resource types. Composite types (like structs and enums) which contain
a resource type would also have to be a resource type. There would be an easy way to convert data
types to fully owned resource types as well; in the case of persistent data structures, converting
a data type to a resource type would be the point at which the “copy on write” operation occurs.
As a result users can use ownership semantics for things which impact global and external state
(like IO) and for cases where they know it will be an important performance optimization.</p>
<p>And the difference in how the language treats data and resources would be identical to the
difference between how Rust treats Copy and non-Copy types. Only resources would have affine
“ownership” semantics - in which moving them invalidates the previous binding. Data types would have
the standard non-linear semantics users are familiar with from most languages. This means that
writing algorithms using data types would be functionally the same as writing algorithms in other
imperative languages, easing the onboarding of users to the language and limiting their errors
related to linear types to areas where they are certain to care.</p>

<p>When you think about cost in the DevOps world, the first thing that will come to mind is your AWS bill, or maybe that Datadog subscription. However, the cost is not always as straightforward as receiving an invoice, and in the DevOps world, the hidden cost is about doing it wrong.</p>

<p>I believe that being aware of hidden costs is a “mental model” you can use when making decisions. Without taking it to account, you are making bets with only half of the information.</p>

<p>Hidden cost takes on many forms in DevOps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Idle developers are waiting for builds to finish.</li>
<li>Over architected Jira workflows that take forever to go through - Jireaucracy (not my term).</li>
<li>Automating things that don’t need to scale - we are all lazy engineers who would rather spend a full day scripting something than doing 5 minutes of manual work.</li>
<li>Trying to save cost where there is no real benefit.</li>
<li>Higher Churn Rate.</li>
<li>Technical debt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s try to take a close look at some of these examples.</p>

<h3 id="not-accounting-for-the-human-element">Not accounting for the human element</h3>

<p>In these complicated days, companies are franticly working to reduce their cloud costs. However, there’s a trap that you need to be mindful of when going through such a process.</p>

<p>Let’s look at this oversimplified equation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>$100</strong> <em>(hourly cost of a developer)</em> <strong>x</strong> <strong>10</strong> <em>(developers)</em> <strong>x</strong> <strong>2</strong> <em>(idle hours a day)</em> <strong>x</strong> <strong>21</strong> <em>(work days in a month)</em> <strong>=</strong> <strong>$42,000</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If, on average, a developer at a company waits on builds or deployment for two hours per day and there are 10 developers on the team, that’s <strong>$2,000/</strong> per day going down the drain. Multiply by 21 workdays per month, and you get <strong>$42,000</strong> of wasted developer time.</p>

<p>Now, suppose that you can cut the idle time by half by adding two new build workers, where each one costs $3000/month. Is it worth it?
It seems trivial when you present it this way but harder to consider when cutting costs across the board.</p>

<p>The problem is that employees are a “fixed cost”, a different budget, and you don’t think of them in the context of wasted resources.</p>

<p>Now think about that developer idling for two hours a day. An idle engineer is a bored engineer, which leads me to the next point -  chasing away competent engineers, or making it more challenging to attract new ones.</p>

<p>You spend significant resources to keep your top engineers, but then they will be the first to jump ship when work is just not fun.</p>

<p>Team leaders spend much of their time in the recruiting process when the company is growing. Time that could be used for onboarding new employees, or mentoring the team, or doing actual development work.</p>

<p>If it takes weeks for engineers to see their work in production or they spend their time chasing the DevOps team to get a simple thing running, they will not stay for long. And worse, you will start getting a bad reputation, resulting in fewer hiring options.</p>

<p>Add burnout to the mix, and now your top developers are producing less, which trickles down to more jr. engineers. You are now stuck with a disgruntled team and no new hires on the horizon.</p>

<h3 id="trying-to-automate-and-scale-at-all-cost">Trying to automate and scale at all cost</h3>

<p>Here is another example that I see all the time - A belief that everything has to be automated and scalable.</p>

<p>“Write this script to automate task XYZ, and don’t forget to document everything and make sure it’s IaC and write a confluence page and…”
But do you really need to automate it? How much time does this task take, and how many times are you planning to perform it?</p>

<p>If it’s an annoying task that takes an hour to perform, and you expect to repeat it three times in the future, does it justify a full week of an engineer to automate?</p>

<p>What about a deployment that is pretty much a one-off? Do you really need to automate it fully? Is it worth your time? Isn’t there something else that is more meaningful for you to do?</p>

<p>I mean, yes, we have standards and workflows and beliefs, but we don’t have to follow them blindly when it doesn’t make sense.</p>

<h3 id="technical-debt">Technical Debt</h3>

<p>Managers who brush off the importance of technical debt are a bit like people who never back up their system. They never saw how technical debt could cripple a company.</p>

<p>If you don’t account for the effects of technical debt, it’s hard to see the cost, but by looking closely, you will soon see how much it affects your velocity, churn, and pretty much every aspect of the value you deliver:</p>

<ol>
<li>It slows down your developers.</li>
<li>Each feature takes twice as much time to complete.</li>
<li>The system keeps crashing.</li>
<li>It burns out your team members.</li>
<li>It makes some business decisions impossible.</li>
</ol>

<p>Think about credit card debt. At one point, the interest rates will make you go bankrupt.
Yes, fixing some of the issues takes time and resources, but can you afford to continue rolling the snowball?</p>

<h2 id="opportunity-cost">Opportunity cost</h2>

<p>In a previous example, I referred to the cost “as is,” using the developer’s direct hourly cost.  But unless you are a service business, a developer hour is worth much more than the cost.</p>

<p>This is why software companies are worth so much - The Developer’s time is a force multiplier. Developers are adding value to the company that is much higher than their yearly cost. The value they add takes the the form of IP and products that you can sell over and over without scaling inventory and distribution.</p>

<p>If we go back to the previous example, if you instead have the developers work on a new product or initiative with those hours, it’s not $42k per month that you are losing, but giving up a much higher future revenue.</p>

<p>And of course, opportunity cost can take on other forms that may not be as intuitive:</p>

<h3 id="milestone-investing">Milestone Investing</h3>

<p>Suppose that you are an early startup that has raised capital with set milestones (<a href="https://avc.com/2009/08/milestone-based-investing/">Milestone Investing</a>). By hitting the next milestone, you will increase your valuation and get a hefty cash infusion.
Now imagine your runway running out, and you have yet to meet the milestone.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be great if you had more time to reach your goals?</p>

<p>Suppose that your developers worked much more efficiently. Instead of idling for two hours, automating and simplifying your developers’ workflow added an hour a day of “working in the zone” for each developer.</p>

<p>How much more could you accomplish by having three more hours a day per developer?</p>

<p>Could you meet that arbitrary board goal with an impossible deadline they set for you?</p>

<p>Is it going to help you meet the milestone the investors set for receiving the next cash infusion?</p>

<p>That’s where we, the DevOps engineers (or whatever you call this function at your company), can help move the needle. We can facilitate growth and improve the productivity of our engineering teams.
It’s not just about throwing new technology at the solution and implementing the latest fad.</p>

<h2 id="so-how-can-we-produce-value-as-devops-engineers">So how can we produce Value as DevOps engineers?</h2>

<p>DevOps has always been tied to business value, but it’s rare to see this idea fully implemented in corporate culture.
Even when it does, it’s usually wrapped around a vague user story with a soggy and generic statement that doesn’t make any sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“This feature will increase user happiness and deliver more value by making the top navigation bar a bit more blueish.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One way to create value is by addressing the cost - by reversing it, we can generate value. All you need is to look at it from a different perspective.</p>

<p>I mentioned Churn before as a metric that the business is actively working to reduce, but for engineers, it’s just “downtime.” Engineers are seldomly exposed to the idea that lowering Churn increases customer lifetime value and affects customer acquisition cost.</p>

<p>So put your DevOps cap on for a minute. Can you think of ways to reduce the churn rate?</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduce downtime.</li>
<li>Reduce latency and load speed.</li>
<li>Optimize report generation time.</li>
<li>Increase email deliverability.</li>
<li>Enable toggle features to allow your product team to test their new features on users.</li>
</ul>

<p>The list goes on, and it’s just for reducing Churn.
And yes, these are obvious priorities for operations, but now you have a clear business value tied to it.</p>

<p>Almost every hidden cost I mentioned earlier could turn into a value proposition for a DevOps related project.</p>

<h2 id="make-sure-you-have-all-the-data">Make sure you have all the data</h2>

<p>All of this “Cost” and “Value” talk is almost meaningless or non-actionable if you don’t have metrics in place.</p>

<ul>
<li>You need to have a cloud provider cost breakdown to know how much you’re spending on a project or a server.</li>
<li>Build time statistics.</li>
<li>Build and deployment success rate over time.<br></li>
<li>How long it takes to onboard a new developer to the team.</li>
</ul>

<p>You need the metrics for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Visibility - You need to be aware of the cost in the first place.</li>
<li>When making a decision, you have to have a benchmark.</li>
<li>To see the impact of your actions when working to reduce the cost.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can’t make informed decisions without having all the data; otherwise, it’s just guessing.</p>



<p>Ask yourself the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do we really need to scale this?</li>
<li>How much time will it take to reduce a cost? What can your developers do instead?</li>
<li>How can you improve the development workflow? How much time can you save?</li>
<li>Do we have a culture that allows open discussion? Do engineers have a voice when it comes to new projects and features?</li>
<li>How can we share knowledge across the organization, so engineers are aware of the product, sales, and marketing struggles?</li>
</ol>

<p>This chapter will give an overview of <code>ruby</code> syntax for command line usage and some examples to show what kind of problems are typically suited for one-liners.</p>
<h2><a href="#why-use-ruby-for-one-liners" id="why-use-ruby-for-one-liners">Why use Ruby for one-liners?</a></h2>
<p>I assume you are already familiar with use cases where command line is more productive compared to GUI. See also this series of articles titled <a href="https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/series/unix-as-ide/">Unix as IDE</a>.</p>
<p>A shell utility like <code>bash</code> provides built-in commands and scripting features to make it easier to solve and automate various tasks. External *nix commands like <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code>, <code>awk</code>, <code>sort</code>, <code>find</code>, <code>parallel</code> etc can be combined to work with each other. Depending upon your familiarity with those tools, you can either use <code>ruby</code> as a single replacement or complement them for specific use cases.</p>
<p>Here's some one-liners (options will be explained later):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ruby -e 'puts readlines.uniq' *.txt</code> — retain only one copy if lines are duplicated from the given list of input file(s)</li>
<li><code>ruby -e 'puts readlines.uniq {|s| s.split[1]}' *.txt</code> — retain only first copy of duplicate lines using second field as duplicate criteria</li>
<li><code>ruby -rcommonregex -ne 'puts CommonRegex.get_links($_)' *.md</code> — extract only the URLs, using a third-party <a href="https://github.com/talyssonoc/CommonRegexRuby">CommonRegexRuby</a> library</li>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63954081/bash-remove-duplicate-of-key-values-with-preserving-order">stackoverflow: merge duplicate key values while preserving order</a> — a recent Q&amp;A that I answered with a simpler <code>ruby</code> solution compared to <code>awk</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The main advantage of <code>ruby</code> over tools like <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> includes feature rich regular expression engine, standard library and third-party libraries. If you don't already know the syntax and idioms for <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code>, learning command line options for <code>ruby</code> would be the easier option. The main disadvantage is that <code>ruby</code> is likely to be slower compared to those tools.</p>
<h2><a href="#command-line-options" id="command-line-options">Command line options</a></h2>

</tbody></table>
<p>This chapter will show examples with <code>-e</code>, <code>-n</code>, <code>-p</code> and <code>-a</code> options. Some more options will be covered in later chapters, but not all of them are discussed in this book.</p>
<h2><a href="#executing-ruby-code" id="executing-ruby-code">Executing Ruby code</a></h2>
<p>If you want to execute a <code>ruby</code> program file, one way is to pass the filename as argument to the <code>ruby</code> command.</p>
<pre><code>$ echo 'puts "Hello Ruby"' &gt; hello.rb
$ ruby hello.rb
Hello Ruby
</code></pre>
<p>For short programs, you can also directly pass the code as an argument to the <code>-e</code> option.</p>
<pre><code>$ ruby -e 'puts "Hello Ruby"'
Hello Ruby

$ # multiple statements can be issued separated by ;
$ ruby -e 'x=25; y=12; puts x**y'
59604644775390625
$ # or use -e option multiple times
$ ruby -e 'x=25' -e 'y=12' -e 'puts x**y'
59604644775390625
</code></pre>
<h2><a href="#filtering" id="filtering">Filtering</a></h2>
<p><code>ruby</code> one-liners can be used for filtering lines matched by a regexp, similar to <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code>. And similar to many command line utilities, <code>ruby</code> can accept input from both <code>stdin</code> and file arguments.</p>
<pre><code>$ # sample stdin data
$ printf 'gate\napple\nwhat\nkite\n'
gate
apple
what
kite

$ # print all lines containing 'at'
$ # same as: grep 'at' and sed -n '/at/p' and awk '/at/'
$ printf 'gate\napple\nwhat\nkite\n' | ruby -ne 'print if /at/'
gate
what

$ # print all lines NOT containing 'e'
$ # same as: grep -v 'e' and sed -n '/e/!p' and awk '!/e/'
$ printf 'gate\napple\nwhat\nkite\n' | ruby -ne 'print if !/e/'
what
</code></pre>
<p>By default, <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> will automatically loop over input content line by line (with <code>\n</code> as the line distinguishing character). The <code>-n</code> or <code>-p</code> option will enable this feature for <code>ruby</code>. As seen before, the <code>-e</code> option accepts code as command line argument. Many shortcuts are available to reduce the amount of typing needed.</p>
<p>In the above examples, a regular expression (defined by the pattern between a pair of forward slashes) has been used to filter the input. When the input string isn't specified in a conditional context (for example: <code>if</code>), the test is performed against global variable <code>$_</code>, which has the contents of the input line (the correct term would be input <strong>record</strong>, see <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_ruby_oneliners/record-separators.html#record-separators">Record separators</a> chapter). To summarize, in a conditional context:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/regexp/</code> is a shortcut for <code>$_ =~ /regexp/</code></li>
<li><code>!/regexp/</code> is a shortcut for <code>$_ !~ /regexp/</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>$_</code> is also the default argument for <code>print</code> method, which is why it is generally preferred in one-liners over <code>puts</code> method. More such defaults that apply to the <code>print</code> method will be discussed later.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Here's an example with file input instead of <code>stdin</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ cat table.txt
brown bread mat hair 42
blue cake mug shirt -7
yellow banana window shoes 3.14

$ # same as: grep -oE '[0-9]+$' table.txt
$ ruby -ne 'puts $&amp; if /\d+$/' table.txt

</blockquote>
<h2><a href="#substitution" id="substitution">Substitution</a></h2>
<p>Use <code>sub</code> and <code>gsub</code> methods for search and replace requirements. By default, these methods operate on <code>$_</code> when the input string isn't provided. For these examples, <code>-p</code> option is used instead of <code>-n</code> option, so that the value of <code>$_</code> is automatically printed after processing each input line.</p>
<pre><code>$ # for each input line, change only first ':' to '-'
$ # same as: sed 's/:/-/' and awk '{sub(/:/, "-")} 1'
$ printf '1:2:3:4\na:b:c:d\n' | ruby -pe 'sub(/:/, "-")'
1-2:3:4
a-b:c:d

$ # for each input line, change all ':' to '-'
$ # same as: sed 's/:/-/g' and awk '{gsub(/:/, "-")} 1'
$ printf '1:2:3:4\na:b:c:d\n' | ruby -pe 'gsub(/:/, "-")'
1-2-3-4
a-b-c-d
</code></pre>
<p>You might wonder how <code>$_</code> is modified without the use of <code>!</code> methods. The reason is that these methods are part of Kernel (see <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/Kernel.html">ruby-doc: Kernel</a> for details) and are available only when <code>-n</code> or <code>-p</code> options are used.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sub(/regexp/, repl)</code> is a shortcut for <code>$_.sub(/regexp/, repl)</code> and <code>$_</code> will be updated if substitution succeeds</li>
<li><code>gsub(/regexp/, repl)</code> is a shortcut for <code>$_.gsub(/regexp/, repl)</code> and <code>$_</code> gets updated if substitution succeeds</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="#field-processing" id="field-processing">Field processing</a></h2>
<p>Consider the sample input file shown below with fields separated by a single space character.</p>
<pre><code>$ cat table.txt
brown bread mat hair 42
blue cake mug shirt -7
yellow banana window shoes 3.14
</code></pre>
<p>Here's some examples that is based on specific field rather than the entire line. The <code>-a</code> option will cause the input line to be split based on whitespaces and the field contents can be accessed using <code>$F</code> global variable. Leading and trailing whitespaces will be suppressed and won't result in empty fields. More details is discussed in <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_ruby_oneliners/field-separators.html#default-field-separation">Default field separation</a> section.</p>
<pre><code>$ # print the second field of each input line
$ # same as: awk '{print $2}' table.txt
$ ruby -ane 'puts $F[1]' table.txt
bread
cake
banana

$ # print lines only if last field is a negative number
$ # same as: awk '$NF&lt;0' table.txt
$ ruby -ane 'print if $F[-1].to_f &lt; 0' table.txt
blue cake mug shirt -7

$ # change 'b' to 'B' only for the first field
$ # same as: awk '{gsub(/b/, "B", $1)} 1' table.txt
$ ruby -ane '$F[0].gsub!(/b/, "B"); puts $F * " "' table.txt
Brown bread mat hair 42
Blue cake mug shirt -7
yellow banana window shoes 3.14
</code></pre>
<h2><a href="#begin-and-end" id="begin-and-end">BEGIN and END</a></h2>
<p>You can use a <code>BEGIN{}</code> block when you need to execute something before input is read and a <code>END{}</code> block to execute something after all of the input has been processed.</p>
<pre><code>$ # same as: awk 'BEGIN{print "---"} 1; END{print "%%%"}'
$ # note the use of ; after BEGIN block
$ seq 4 | ruby -pe 'BEGIN{puts "---"}; END{puts "%%%"}'
---

</code></pre>
<h2><a href="#env-hash" id="env-hash">ENV hash</a></h2>
<p>When it comes to automation and scripting, you'd often need to construct commands that can accept input from user, file, output of a shell command, etc. As mentioned before, this book assumes <code>bash</code> as the shell being used. To access environment variables of the shell, you can call the special hash variable <code>ENV</code> with the name of the environment variable as a string key.</p>
<pre><code>$ # existing environment variable
$ # output shown here is for my machine, would differ for you
$ ruby -e 'puts ENV["HOME"]'
/home/learnbyexample
$ ruby -e 'puts ENV["SHELL"]'
/bin/bash

$ # defined along with ruby command
$ # note that the variable is placed before the shell command
$ word='hello' ruby -e 'puts ENV["word"]'
hello
$ # the input characters are preserved as is
$ ip='hi\nbye' ruby -e 'puts ENV["ip"]'
hi\nbye
</code></pre>
<p>Here's another example when a regexp is passed as an environment variable content.</p>
<pre><code>$ cat word_anchors.txt
sub par
spar
apparent effort
two spare computers
cart part tart mart

$ # assume 'r' is a shell variable that has to be passed to the ruby command
$ r='\Bpar\B'

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall problem</a> is famously unintuitive. This post starts with an extreme version where the solution is blindingly obvious. We then go through a series of small changes. It will be clear that these don’t affect the solution. At the end, we arrive at the classic Monte Hall problem.</p>

<p>For reference, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">classic formulation</a> goes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, “Do you want to pick door No. 2?” Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Intuitively, many people guess it doesn’t matter if you switch. But it does. You get the car 2/3 of the time if you switch, and 1/3 of the time if you don’t. Why?</p>



<p>Here’s our first game.</p>

<ol>
  <li>There are 10 doors. A car is randomly placed behind one, and goats behind the other 9.</li>
  <li>You pick one door.</li>
  <li>You get two options:
    <ul>
      <li>Option A: You get whatever is behind the door you picked.</li>
      <li>Option B: You get whatever is behind all of the other 9 doors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/monty-hall/game1.png">
</p>

<p>There’s nothing mysterious here. You should choose option B. There’s only a 10% chance you picked the right door, so there’s a 90% chance the car is behind one of the others.</p>



<p>Now, we slightly update the game (new part in bold).</p>

<ol>
  <li>There are 10 doors. A car is randomly placed behind one, and goats behind the other 9.</li>
  <li>You pick one door.</li>
  <li><strong>Monty says “Hey! I promise you that there is a goat behind at least 8 of the other 9 doors!”</strong></li>
  <li>You get two options:
    <ul>
      <li>Option A: You get whatever is behind the door you picked.</li>
      <li>Option B: You get whatever is behind all of the other 9 doors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/monty-hall/game2.png">
</p>

<p>Monty’s statement changes nothing. You don’t need to rely on his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall#/media/File:Monty_hall_abc_tv.JPG">trustworthy looks</a>. You already <em>knew</em> there were at least 8 goats! Option B still gets you the car 90% of the time.</p>



<p>Let’s update the game again (new part in bold).</p>

<ol>
  <li>There are 10 doors. A car is randomly placed behind one, and goats behind the other 9.</li>
  <li>You pick one door.</li>
  <li><strong>Monty looks behind the other 9 doors. He chooses 8 with goats behind them, and opens them.</strong></li>
  <li>You get two options:
    <ul>
      <li>Option A: You get whatever is behind the door you picked.</li>
      <li>Option B: You get whatever is behind all of the other 9 doors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/monty-hall/game3.png">
</p>

<p>The key insight is this: When Monty shows you that 8 of the 9 other doors contain goats, you haven’t learned anything relevant to your decision. You <em>already knew there were at least 8 goats behind the other doors</em>! So this is just like game 2. Option B still gets you the car 90% of the time.</p>

<p>Want more intuition? Suppose you picked door 3. Imagne Monty walking past the doors, opening doors 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, <strong>skipping 7</strong>, then opening 8, 9, and 10. Doesn’t door 7 seem special?</p>



<p>Let’s make another change. Finally, we arrive at a game very similar to Monty Hall.</p>

<ol>
  <li>There are 10 doors. A car is randomly placed behind one, and goats behind the other 9.</li>
  <li>You pick one door.</li>
  <li>Monty looks behind the other 9 doors. He chooses 8 of them with goats behind them, and opens them.</li>
  <li>You get two options:
    <ul>
      <li>Option A: You get whatever is behind the door you picked.</li>
      <li>Option B: You get whatever is behind <strong>the other closed door</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/monty-hall/game4.png">
</p>

<p>The only difference with Game 3 is that option B doesn’t get you the 8 visible goats. Since you don’t care about goats, this makes no difference. This is still just like the game 3. You get the car 90% of the time by switching.</p>



<p>Here is the last game. We just change the number of doors from 10 to 3.</p>

<ol>
  <li>There are <strong>3</strong> doors. A car is randomly placed behind one, and goats behind the other <strong>2</strong>.</li>
  <li>You pick one door.</li>
  <li>Monty looks behind the other <strong>2</strong> doors. He chooses one <strong>1</strong> of them with a goat behind it, and opens it.**</li>
  <li>You get two options:
    <ul>
      <li>Option A: You get whatever is behind the door you picked.</li>
      <li>Option B: You get whatever is behind the other closed door.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/monty-hall/game5.png">
</p>

<p>Of course, you still want to choose option B. The chance of success is now 2/3 instead of 9/10. This game is exactly Monty Hall, so we’re done.</p>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It’s important that Monty looked behind the doors before choosing which to open. This is where people’s intuition usually fails. If he had chosen a door at random — <em>in a way that he risked possibly exposing a car</em>, then the situation would be different. (In that case, there’s no advantage or harm in switching.) But he doesn’t choose the door at random. He deliberately chooses to show you goats. Since this is always possible, it tells you nothing. I think this is the crux of what makes this problem unintuitive. Many people intuitively think it doen’t matter if you switch. And that <em>would be correct</em> if the door had been opened at random!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might be helpful to draw a diagram of the relationship of the different games, starting with classic Monty Hall and ending with the extreme version.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Game 5 (Classic Monty Hall)<br>
 ↓<br>
 ↓ (Use 10 doors instead of 3)<br>
 ↓ <br>
Game 4<br>
 ↓<br>
 ↓ (If you switch, get the contents of <em>all</em> other doors, not just the other closed door.)<br>
 ↓<br>
Game 3<br>
 ↓<br>
 ↓ (Monty promises 8 goats behind the other doors instead of showing you.)<br>
 ↓<br>
Game 2<br>
 ↓<br>
 ↓ (Monty doesn’t bother promsising.)<br>
 ↓<br>
Game 1 (Dyno Might© Monty Hall)</p>

  <li>
    <p>Monty Hall was actually named “Monte” at birth! Given that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">Monte Carlo simulations</a> are often used for exploring the Monty Hall problem, that’s either a tragedy for puns or a miracle for confused students.</p>

<p>Of all the allures of startup culture, few are more desireable than the speed and nimbleness of a small team. Maintaining that feeling as a company grows is a challenge. In 2012, Spotify shared its way of working and suggested it had figured it out.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I was excited to see <em>the Spotify model</em> in action when I interviewed for a product management role at its Stockholm headquarters in 2017. However, the recruiter surprised me before the first interview. She cautioned me to not expect Spotify to be an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile</a> utopia.</p>
<p>I joined the company after it had tripled in size to 3,000 people over 18 months. I learned the famed squad model was only ever aspirational and never fully implemented. I witnessed organizational chaos as the company’s leaders incrementally transitioned to more traditional management structures.</p>
<p>When I asked my coworkers why the content was not removed or updated to reflect reality, I never got a good answer. Many people ironically thought the posts were great for recruiting. I no longer work at Spotify, so I am sharing my experience to set the record straight. The Spotify squad model failed Spotify and it will fail your company too.</p>

<h3>But you don’t have to take my word for it.</h3>
<p>The co-author of the Spotify model<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> and multiple agile coaches who worked at Spotify have been telling people to not copy it for years. Unfortunately, truth doesn’t spread as quickly or as widely as an idea people want to believe in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Even at the time we wrote it, we weren’t doing it. It was part ambition, part approximation. People have really struggled to copy something that didn’t really exist.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—Joakim Sundén, agile coach at Spotify&nbsp;2011–2017<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“It worries me when people look at what we do and think it’s a framework they can just copy and implement.</em> … We are really trying hard now to emphasize we have problems as well. It’s not all ‘shiny and everything works well and all our squads are super amazing’.”</p>

<h2>Recap</h2>
<p>You can read and watch the <a href="#1">original content</a> in less than 30 minutes or <a href="#spread-4">skip to the next section</a> if you are familiar. Here is a brief summary.</p>
<p>Spotify had teams it called <em>squads</em> because it sounded cooler (not joking). A group of teams were organized into a department called a <em>tribe</em>. Each team was intended to be an autonomous mini-startup, with a product manager acting as mini-CEO for a feature area. The teams had designers and software engineers with a range of specializations. The intent was that a team should have every skill necessary without needing to rely on another team for success.</p>
<p>Product managers had a traditional management structure. A product manager for a team reported to their department’s product director (<em>“tribe lead”</em>). Same for designers. Software engineers, however, were managed outside of the team structure.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section>
<div>
<p><em>“Chapter leads”</em> managed software engineers specializing in a specific type of software development across the department. For example, all of the software engineers working on backend APIs across all the teams within the department would have one manager and all of the Android mobile engineers in the department would have a different manager. The intent was to allow engineers to be moved between teams within the department to best meet business requirements without them having to change managers.</p>

<h3>Matrix management solved the wrong problem</h3>
<p>The “full stack” agile team worked well, but the matrix management of software engineers introduced more problems than it solved.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Teams at Spotify were rather long-lived. The benefit of not having to change manager when moving to another team was limited.</p></li>
<li><p>Engineering managers in this model had little responsibility beyond the career development of the people they managed. Even then, their ability to help with interpersonal people skills development was limited. An engineering manager would not manage enough of the other people on the team or be involved enough in the daily context to independently assess conflict within the team.</p></li>

<li><p>Without a single engineering manager responsible for the engineers on a team, the product manager lacked an equivalent peer—the mini-CTO to their mini-CEO role. There was no single person accountable for the engineering team’s delivery or who could negotiate prioritization of work at an equivalent level of responsibility.</p><p>When disagreements within the engineering team arose, the product manager needed to negotiate with all of the engineers on the team. If the engineers could not reach a consensus, the product manager needed to escalate to as many engineering managers as there were engineering specializations within the team. A team with backend, Web app, and mobile app engineers would have at least 3 engineering managers who might need to get involved. If those engineering managers could not reach a consensus, a single team’s issue would have to escalate to the department’s engineering director.</p></li>

<p>“Chapter leads are servant-leaders who help you grow as an individual. They don’t really work with any team. They have direct reports on all the teams.

<p><strong>Learn from Spotify’s mistakes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A product—design—engineering team typically contains more engineers than designers or product managers. Having a single engineering manager for the engineers on the team creates an accountable escalation path for conflict within the team.</li>
<li>Product managers should have an equivalent peer for engineering. Product managers should be accountable for the prioritization of work. Engineering managers should be accountable for the engineers’ execution, which includes being able to negotiate speed and quality tradeoffs with the product manager.</li>

<section id="too-much-autonomy">
<div>
<h3>Spotify fixated on team autonomy</h3>
<p>When a company is small, teams have to do a wide range of work to deliver and have to shift initiatives frequently. As a company grows from startup to scale-up, duplicated functions across teams move to new teams dedicated to increasing organization efficiency by reducing duplication. With more teams, the need for a team to shift initiative decreases in frequency. Both of these changes allow for teams to think more deeply and long term about the problems they are scoped to solve. Faster iteration, however, is not guaranteed. Every responsibility a team cedes to increase its focus becomes a new cross-team dependency.</p>
<p>Spotify did not define a common process for cross-team collaboration. Allowing every team to have a unique way of working meant each team needed a unique way of engagement when collaborating. Overall organization productivity suffered.</p>
<p>The Spotify model was documented when Spotify was a much smaller company. It was supposed to be a multiple part series, according to Anders Ivarsson. Autonomy made the first cut, but the parts on alignment and accountability were never completed.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>Learn from Spotify’s mistakes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Autonomy requires alignment. Company priorities must be defined by leadership. Autonomy does not mean teams get to do whatever they want.</li>
<li>Processes for cross-team collaboration must be defined. Autonomy does not mean leaving teams to self-organize every problem.</li>
<li>How success is measured must be defined by leadership so people can effectively negotiate cross-team dependency prioritization.</li>
<li>Autonomy requires accountability. Product management is accountable for value. The team is accountable for delivering ‘done’ increments. Mature teams can justify their independence with their ability to articulate business value, risk, learning, and the next optimal move.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup></li>

<h3>Collaboration was an assumed competency</h3>
<p>While Spotify gave teams control over their way of working, many people did not have a basic understanding of Agile practices. This resulted in teams iterating through process tweaks in blind hope of finding the combination that would help them improve their delivery. People lacked a common language to effectively discuss the process problems, the education to solve them, and the experience to evaluate performance. It was not really <em>agile</em>. It was just <em>not-waterfall</em>.</p>
<p><em>“Agile coaches”</em> were internal consultants Spotify provided teams to teach and suggest process improvements. While well-intentioned, there were not enough coaches to help every team. A coach’s engagement with a team was rarely long enough to span a project’s completion to help a team evaluate performance. More so, they were not accountable for anything.</p>

<p>Sure, it took me 6 days to amass 3,626 sales for a total of $101,528, but like any overnight success, it was years in the making. In my case, about 7 years.</p>

<p>In 2013, the jailbreaking days of iOS were in full effect. Inspired, I created and sold an icon set titled 'Greyish HD' on the Cydia store for $0.99. It was the first few dollars I ever made on the internet. I think I made a total of $17, and it was magical.</p>

<p>It wasn't about the $17, obviously; it was how I earned it. I spent time creating something that I thought was cool, then hit publish. After a few days, random strangers I've never met before decided to spend their hard-earned cents on my icon set, oftentimes while I was working on something else entirely. Without realizing it, I just discovered digital content leverage: <strong>create something once with sufficient effort, then sell it repeatedly with minimal effort.</strong></p>

<p>Fast forward 7 years later, minus 6 days. I saw some people sharing screenshots of their iPhones after discovering that iOS 14 now allows you to add custom icons to your home screen using the Siri Shortcuts app. This was the first time you can really customize iOS, and it was catching on. </p>

<p>This is something people have been doing for years on jailbroken iOS and Android devices, except this time, you can do it natively on iOS.</p>

<p>As soon as I noticed the hype, I put together some <a href="https://icons.tr.af/">icons</a> in my own style, downloaded some widgets, and tried it all out. I thought it looked cool, so I shared a screenshot of it on Twitter. Right away, people started asking about the icons in the screenshot. So I quickly packaged them, uploaded them to <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a>, and embedded them on a <a href="https://notion.so/">Notion</a> site using <a href="https://super.so/">Super</a>. All of this took about two hours.</p>

<p>The next day, the tweet had hundreds of retweets, thousands of likes, and over 100k impressions. The day after that, almost a million. The next thing I knew, it was everywhere. My icons got published on notable tech sites like <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/723490/ios-14-iphone-home-screen-customization/">Cult of Mac</a>, <a href="https://www.imore.com/people-are-making-real-money-selling-icon-sets-ios-14-home-screens">iMore</a>, <a href="https://allthingst3ch.com/ios14homescreen">AllThingsTech</a>, and <a href="https://gridfiti.com/aesthetic-ios-home-screen-ideas">Gridfiti</a>. I think at this time I was around the $6k mark in sales.</p>

<p>Then, MKBHD happened. He shared a <a href="https://youtu.be/cH66LWWluVE">video</a> about all of this—using my icons for his setup, and linked them in the description. The next thing I knew, I was making $28 what felt like every 28 seconds. My phone turned into the ultimate dopamine dispenser (if it wasn't already). I had to disable notifications.</p>

<p>The day after, sales jumped from $6k to about $40k, and during the time of this writing, sales are at $116,147 from 4,188 customers.</p>

<p>All from one. Single. <a href="https://twitter.com/traf/status/1307707156788060160">Tweet</a>.</p>

<p>The right content, posted at the right time, can create unimaginable results. Although there's likely plenty of other variables that went into making this work, there are a few key insights that I think increased my odds.</p>

<h3>Publish often</h3>

<p>Continually putting things out into the world creates proof of work. The difference between where you are and where you want to be could be as little as sharing what you build, or even what you know.</p>

<p>There's only so much we can control once pushing something out into the world, but publishing often will increase your odds at finding something that sticks. They say that fortune favors the bold. In the internet age, the bold are those that aren't afraid to publish their work for the world to see. The internet is a never-ending stream of content, the idea of being annoying or over-sharing is only an idea that you invent to stop you from sharing. </p>

<h3>Act immediately</h3>

<p>I could have easily ignored the requests for the icons, or directed people to icon sets that already existed, but that would be a missed opportunity. Since I've done similar icon sets so many times already in the past, I was ready for it. Acting quickly is crucial if you plan on riding the wave. </p>

<h3>Be transparent</h3>

<p>I shared <a href="https://twitter.com/traf/status/1308158718975111175">this tweet</a> the day after posting my home screen with details of all the hype, and it created even more hype. It brought another 540,000 impressions and added fuel to an already growing fire. <strong>Share what works, and share what doesn't.</strong> Transparency is visibility.</p>

<h3>Have a clear schedule</h3>

<p>A lot of this was happening on a Monday morning. If I were working a more traditional job, or had time commitments that I had previously scheduled, I wouldn't have been able to act on my ideas as quickly as I did. I get that not everyone has the privilege of a flexible schedule, but almost anyone can start to move towards it if they want it badly enough. Freedom of a clear schedule allowed me to take action as soon as the inspiration hit, which was incredibly important to maximize exposure. Inspiration is a productivity-multiplier, but it's perishable—so act quickly.</p>

<h3>Charge more</h3>

<p>If I would have asked anyone what to price these at, most would have said $2, or maybe $5. One thing I knew for sure was that the people most likely to buy these were not the same people who were jailbreaking their iOS devices in the past. These are first time iOS customizers, so there's no notion of what an iOS icon set should be priced at.</p>

<h3>Do it for the art</h3>

<p>If I would have done this exclusively for the goal of making money, I'm convinced it wouldn't have worked nearly as well as it did. I see copycats showing up everywhere. They see success, and try to replicate exactly how it happened, but it won't work. At least not nearly as well. The reasons for this post is not to teach you how to sit on the edge of your seat, foaming at the mouth at the chance to exploit the next big internet trend, but it's to push you to keep working at the things you enjoy, share them with the world, and letting the internet do the rest.</p>

<h3>Aftermath</h3>

<p>So what came of all this? I suspect this is why most of you are here reading this, so here's a recap of everything that came from last week in numbers, from the time of this writing:</p>

<h4>Short-term metrics:</h4>

<ul><li>4,188 total icon sales</li><li>$116,147 in revenue</li><li>97% profit margins</li><li>6.2m impression</li><li>216,800 visitors</li></ul>

<h4>Long-term metrics:</h4>

<ul><li>5,216 email subscribers</li><li>4,620 Twitter followers</li><li>180 <a href="https://super.so/">Super</a> customers</li></ul>

<h3>What's next?</h3>

<p>In the same way that creating icon sets 7 years ago prepared me for last week, this whole experiment has likely prepared me for what's to come years from now.</p>

<p>The best part about this is the freedom its bought me, to keep building things that'll create even more freedom. <strong>Spending time on things that will buy you time is always a good use of it.</strong> When people buy into what ever it is you're selling, they're not only giving you money, but they're contributing to your future freedom.</p>

<p>The market will decide a huge part of what comes after sharing something, so continually increase your odds by building, publishing, then repeating. Try many things once to figure out what you want to do twice. Figure out what you've got stored in your brain that can be of value to others, then share it with the world. You might be surprised of what comes of it.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

September 30, 2020 | https://pgaleone.eu/cicd/unreal-engine/2020/09/30/continuous-integration-with-unreal-engine-4/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://pgaleone.eu/cicd/unreal-engine/2020/09/30/continuous-integration-with-unreal-engine-4/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>Continuous Integration (CI) is an essential step in the development pipeline of well-designed software infrastructure. The goal of CI is to <strong>automatize the boring stuff</strong> by letting the developers focusing on the code and, at the same time, helping them in producing good quality software.</p>
<p>Often, we read together two acronyms (and this article makes no exception) CI &amp; CD. While CI always stands for Continuous Integration, CD has two different meanings:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Continuous Delivery</strong> where a developer’s change is automatically bug-tested and uploaded to a repository, or</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Deployment</strong> where a developer’s change is automatically released to the production environment, where the customer can use this brand-new version.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this article, I’m going to show you how to configure and use the CI/CD tool provided by GitLab to correctly manage the CI/CD pipeline of an <strong>Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) project</strong> that needs to work (and thus, to be tested) on 3 different platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows</li>
<li>macOS</li>
<li>Linux</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following, “CD” will stand for Continuous Delivery - so I won’t cover the Deployment part.</p>

<p><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> is a complete DevOps platform: it offers us a complete CI/CD toolchain, an amazing issue tracking suite, and exposes in a user-friendly-way almost every Git’s feature.</p>
<p><img src="https://pgaleone.eu/images/ciue4/cicd_pipeline_infograph.png" alt="GitLab Continuous Integration pipeline"></p>
<p>The CI/CD toolchain is composed of 3 main parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>gitlab-ci.yml</code> file that contains the configuration of the CI/CD pipeline. Using this YAML file we can configure the CI/CD behavior: what should happen on every commit or merge request, what should happen at scheduled times, and <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/">many many more</a>. This file contains the commands to execute (a batch of commands is called “job”) on the specified runner.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/">GitLab Runners</a>. A runner is a software able to receive from GitLab a job, execute it, and send back the result to GitLab. Several runners can (and should) run in parallel, allowing the whole infrastructure to scale. The execution of the job is delegated to an “executor”.</li>
<li><strong>The executor</strong>. During the configuration of the runner, we can specify what type of executor to use. In particular, it’s possible to use the machine where the runner is installed to run directly in its shell the commands (that’s the shell executor), or use Docker to execute the commands into a container, or even use a virtual machine or a Kubernetes cluster (for a complete reference see: https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/).</li>
</ul>
<p>The amazing thing is that GitLab Runner is a software written in Go: this means that it can run perfectly on our three target platforms: Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>
<p>Moreover, installing it is trivial as explained in <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/#install-gitlab-runner">the documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="executors-for-ue4-projects">Executors for UE4 projects</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/">Unreal Engine</a> is a cross-platform game engine, quoting the official website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unreal Engine is the world’s most open and advanced real-time 3D creation tool. Continuously evolving to serve not only its original purpose as a state-of-the-art game engine, today it gives creators across industries the freedom and control to deliver cutting-edge content, interactive experiences, and immersive virtual worlds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>UE4 is really an amazing project, but this amazingness comes at a cost: it’s <strong>heavy</strong>. The engine itself, <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/GettingStarted/DownloadingUnrealEngine/index.html">available on GitHub</a>, weights ~132GB on Linux:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>du</span> <span>-hs</span> /opt/unreal-engine/
132G    /opt/unreal-engine/
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Since our goal is to create an environment that contains the compiled engine (for our three target platforms) and use it inside our CI. Using a <strong>Docker executor</strong> it is perhaps the best possible solution.</p>
<h3 id="docker-executor">Docker executor</h3>
<p>As previously stated, one of the costs of using UE4 is its size: when we have enough resources this isn’t a problem (you need a good amount of storage and a lot of memory and CPU power to compile and use the engine), and it’s not a problem even when using Docker on Linux. However, building a Docker image containing UE4 on Windows is somehow a difficult and long process, because there is a well-know and <em>unresolved</em> issue about the creation of <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/37581">filesystem layers lager than 8 GiB</a>.</p>
<p>Although there are well-known issues (only on Windows), using a Docker executor have a lot of advantages like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spawning a container is a cheap operation.</li>
<li>Every container is isolated.</li>
<li>It is possible to scale the solution easily (easy to parallelize).</li>
<li>Customizing/Creating a Dockerfile is easy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating docker containers with unreal-engine inside is a challenge that <a href="https://adamrehn.com/">Adam Rehn</a> with his <a href="https://unrealcontainers.com/">Unreal Containers</a> <strong>amazingly faced</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://pgaleone.eu/images/ciue4/ue-plus-docker.svg" alt="UnrealContainer logo"></p>
<p>The project, and Python package, <a href="https://docs.adamrehn.com/ue4-docker/read-these-first/introduction-to-ue4-docker">ue4-docker</a> contains all we need to create a docker image that we will later on use in our <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file.</p>
<p>Using <code>ue4-docker</code> creating an image is so easy as:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>REPO_URL</span><span>=</span><span>"&lt;set url here&gt;"</span>
<span>BRANCH</span><span>=</span><span>"&lt;set branch here&gt;"</span>
ue4-docker build custom:4.25.3 <span>-repo</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$REPO_URL</span><span>"</span> <span>-branch</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$BRANCH</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
           <span>--exclude</span> debug <span>\ </span><span># exclude debug symbols to reduce the image and workaround the windows issue</span>
           <span>--exclude</span> templates <span>\ </span><span># exclude the templates since we don't need them in our CI</span>
           <span>--exclude</span> ddc <span># exclude DDC to speed up the image creation </span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The same command can be executed in a Linux and in a Windows machine. Personally, I prefer having a Linux machine that executes a docker container, instead of using a Windows machine to execute a docker container containing a Linux image (for performance reasons and to save time during the creation of the images too).</p>
<p>At the end of the execution of the <code>ue4-docker</code> command, we end up with a set of images ready to use like:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>docker images | grep ue4

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>A complete description of what is inside every image is available in the <a href="https://docs.adamrehn.com/ue4-docker/building-images/available-container-images">List of available container images</a> page.</p>
<p>Using Docker we can cover the CI for the Linux and Windows platforms. macOS, instead, can’t run inside a container :( hence we have to use another executor.</p>
<h3 id="shell-executor">Shell executor</h3>
<p>The shell executor is just “the current machine”. Thus, we can install <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/osx.html">GitLab Runner on macOS</a> and manually install all the dependencies that are, in our case, only unreal engine and the Xcode toolchain.</p>
<p>Differently from the Docker executor, the Shell executor has several disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>No isolation at all.</li>
<li>No native support for parallel and isolated executions.</li>
<li>It doesn’t scale well.</li>
<li>We have to clean up the dirt left by the operations we do in the CI (e.g. temporary files).</li>
</ul>
<p>The only advantage we have is the simplicity of installation: we just have to install UE4 on our machine and we are ready to go.</p>
<p>Supposing to have Unreal Engine already installed (the setup on Mac, Linux, Windows is straightforward; it’s just a matter of following the <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/GettingStarted/Installation/index.html">guide</a>), the only thing we need to do is to install another Python tool created by Adam Rehn: <a href="https://docs.adamrehn.com/ue4cli/overview/introduction-to-ue4cli">ue4cli</a>.</p>
<p>This Python package implements a command-line tool called <code>ue4</code>: this tool simplifies the invocation/usage of the UE4 toolchain and, perhaps more importantly, it unifies the interface we have to use on different platforms.</p>
<p>The tool is installed into the <code>ue4-full</code> images and that’s the reason we’re going to use these images in our <code>gitlab-ci.yml</code> file.</p>
<h2 id="the-cicd-pipeline">The CI/CD pipeline</h2>
<p>As introduced at the beginning of the article, after setting up the runners and the executor, we are ready to describe the CI/CD pipeline in the <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file.</p>
<h3 id="continuous-integration">Continuous Integration</h3>
<p>Let’s start with the automatization of the boring stuff, we need to find a way to automatically answer these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the code following the code style / required formatting?</li>
<li>Does the code I want to merge compile correctly on every platform?</li>
<li>Am I introducing regressions?</li>
</ol>
<p>To answer all these questions, and be ready for the continuous delivery stuff, we need to define the variables and the stages (of the pipeline) we plan to execute.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>variables</span><span>:</span>
    <span>GIT_SUBMODULE_STRATEGY</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>recursive"</span>
    <span>GIT_STRATEGY</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>fetch"</span>
    <span>GIT_CHECKOUT</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>true"</span>
    <span>GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>1"</span>
    <span>GET_SOURCES_ATTEMPTS</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>10"</span>

<span>stages</span><span>:</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>static-analysis</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>build</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>tests</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>package</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>static-analysis</strong> stage will contain the jobs related to the source code analysis. The checks for the source code formatting (the only one presented in this article) and other checks related to the analysis of the source code itself.</li>
<li>The <strong>build</strong> stage will contain the jobs that answer question 2.</li>
<li>The <strong>test</strong> stage contains the execution of the test cases (because every unreal project uses the unreal test suite - isn’t it?)</li>
<li>The <strong>package</strong> stage contains the continuous delivery part of the pipeline.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="static-analysis">Static Analysis</h5>
<p>Every C++ project should follow a code style. This CI job uses <code>clang-format</code> and <code>dos2unix</code> to check if every committed file has the correct encoding (we need UTF-8 encoded files to be sure that every compiler on every platform can read them well) and follows the style rules present in the <code>.clang-format</code> file that should be present into every project :)</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>clang-format</span><span>:</span>
    <span>image</span><span>:</span> <span>alpine</span>
    <span>stage</span><span>:</span> <span>static-analysis</span>
    <span>variables</span><span>:</span>
        <span>GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>1"</span>
    <span># empty dependencies = do not need artifacts from previous stages</span>
    <span>dependencies</span><span>:</span> <span>[]</span>
    <span>script</span><span>:</span>

<h3>What's inside</h3>
<p>How can you drive the thinking on what to develop, why and how to
do it — leveraging the insights from both team and stakeholders — all the way from idea to
deploy?</p>
<p>This book tries to answer the above question. As part of our own
product development at Delibr, we interviewed over 300 Product Managers to understand how they work
and collaborate around feature development, what problems they face, and the many approaches to
solving those problems. </p>
<p>"Epic alignment" describes four broad approaches that we saw help
Product Managers excel.</p>
<h3>What you'll learn</h3>
<ul>
<li>How to drive product development towards impact based on research</li>
<li>How to use user stories as a shared language to align your entire team</li>
<li>How to write feature documents that drive joint understanding and act as a single source of
truth
</li>
<li>How to tackle the massive amounts of decisions needed for every epic</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL is a query language for APIs that describes how to ask &amp; fetch the data from the server to the client which of course requires setting up a server. Below you will find a list of the most popular GraphgQL server implementations. There’s quite a few of them so we’re not going to get through the lot of them in one go.</p>
<h2>Express GraphQL</h2>
<p>It is said that <a href="https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql">Express GraphQL</a> is the simplest way to run a GraphQL API server. Express is a popular web application framework for Node.js allowing you to create a GraphQL server with any HTTP web framework supporting connect styled middleware including <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a>, <a href="http://restify.com/">Restify</a> and, of course, <a href="https://github.com/senchalabs/connect">Connect</a>. Getting started is as easy as installing some additional dependencies in form of <code>npm install express express-graphql graphql --save</code></p>

<p>Friends, this should give you a little boost at the end of your day – because 8-Bit Show and Tell has located a Commodore 64 program hidden within Prodigal’s 1984 album entitled Electric Eye. I was just goofing around on YouTube when I came across this video – which was originally uploaded back on October 19th of this year. Since I have been known to talk about my love of the Commdore 64 computer of my youth – the title of the video caught my attention pretty quickly. And seriously, how absolutely amazing is it that in this day and age we can still be surprised by little Easter eggs from 35 years ago? As Robin will demonstrate on the video itself the program was hidden in the runout groove on the B side of <em>Electric Eye</em>  – which you can plainly see in this article image header has a “C-64” scratched into said groove. Probably one of the reasons that not a lot of people know about the program is because it needed to be played on your turntable where you could record the hidden program on a cassette tape to upload it on your C64… that is a little bit of work. As the video will show – sometimes using older technology takes a couple of tries – or even totally different equipment in some cases.</p>







<p>I will have to in the near future share an article about the Mattel Electronics Aquarius computer that we obtained at the arcade – in fact I talked just a bit about it in the <em><a href="https://popcultureretrorama.com/2019/11/24/diary-of-an-arcade-employee-podcast-1up-night-stalker/">Night Stalker</a></em> podcast earlier today. Robin was able to make contact with one of the surviving members of <strong>Prodigal</strong> by the way – which was a Christian rock group, active from 1975 until 1986 – to ask how and why this 35 year-old computer program was included on the <em>Electric Eye</em> album. </p>

<p>The discovery of what amounts to a simple message from <strong>Prodigal</strong> 35 years later might not be the most groundbreaking thing you’ll see today… but I thought it was special enough that I had to share it. Watching this particular 8-Bit Show and Tell video will in addition show you how to hack your turntable to disable the auto return if you need to!</p>

<p>Last week I was trying to add some <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/822/commits/aa833603a6b4c947c21da04aeac40d80444ebcc1#diff-b04459e37839cd223176618536295715R425">testing code to libsecp256k1</a> and I was pulling out my hair trying to get it to work.
No amount of <code>printf</code> was working to illuminate what I was doing wrong.
Finally, out of desperation, I thought I would do a quick check to see if there are any compiler bugs related to <code>memcmp</code>, and lo and behold, I found <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=95189">GCC bug #95189: memcmp being wrongly stripped like strcmp</a>.</p><p>Honestly this was a pretty horrifying bug to read about.
Under some circumstances GCC 9 and 10 will cause <code>memcmp</code> to return an incorrect value when one of the inputs is statically known array that contains <code>NULL</code> bytes.
As I rushed to <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/roconnor/2b8e22e829ed80088ed6690cc3c7f3a8/raw/455571a6d9053c597c1585debe6f9dbd6af85071/gistfile1.txt">recompile my computer system using GCC 8</a>, I contemplated the vast consequences of such a bug could be, and pondered how it was possible that computers could function at all.</p><p>However over the week, with the help of my colleagues, we managed to get a better understanding of the scope of the bug.
The bug can only convert non-zero values to zero values.
The static array needs to have a <code>NULL</code> byte within the first 4 bytes.
Most importantly, the <code>memcmp</code> result must not immediately be compared to <code>0</code> for equality or inequality, or any equivalent test.
A different code path is taken in the compiler in that case.
That explained why computers were still functioning.
I expect the vast majority of the uses of <code>memcmp</code> does an immediate test for equality with <code>0</code>.</p><p>I still wondered though, how much code was being affected. My colleague Tim suggested that it would be possible to instrument GCC to emit a message when it was about to miscompile a program.
Together we came up with <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=49276&amp;action=diff">a patch</a> to GCC 9 and 10 that would print a debugging message.
Once again, I recompiled my entire system, to see what GCC was miscompiling.

<p>On my entire system I only found 10 lines of code that were miscompiled.

None of the lines looked that serious.
I am not sure which one is the worse: the reduced message integrity code(?) from some ARCFOUR implementation or the something something from an ATM driver?</p><p>The mplayer miscompilation is the most mysterious.
The code surrounding that function all appears to be immediately compare <code>memcmp</code> with <code>0</code>.
And given that my debug message refused to point to exactly what line is being miscompiled in that function, I fear some set of optimizations has happened to allow this code to be miscompiled in some way.</p><p>With more hardware I could do <a href="https://hydra.nixos.org/jobset/nixpkgs/trunk#tabs-jobs">a more thorough investigation</a> of the consequences of this GCC bug.
Until then I am going to stick with GCC 8 until GCC 9 and 10 have a new point releases.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>You’ve likely used UUIDs in projects before and assumed them to be unique. Today, we’ll take a look at the main aspects of the implementation and understand why UUIDs are <em>practically </em>unique, though an incredibly small potential for duplication exists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The modern day implementation of UUIDs can be tied back to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RFC 4122 </a>which introduced 5 different approaches for generating these identifiers. We’ll take a look at each one and we’ll step through the implementation details of Version 1 &amp; Version 4 in a moment.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>
<p>UUIDs, or universally unique IDentifiers, are simply a 128 bit number used to uniquely identify items in software development. Their canonical textual representation is as a series of 32 hexadecimal characters which are separated into five groups by hyphens in the form 8-4-4-4-12.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example,&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>3422b448-2460-4fd2-9183-8000de6f8343</code></p>
<p>Embedded inside this seemingly random series of hexadecimal characters is information about the UUID implementation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>xxxxxxxx-xxxx-<strong>M</strong>xxx-<strong>N</strong>xxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx</code></p>
<p>The values in the M and N locations uniquely identify the UUID version and variant respectively.</p>
<h4><strong>Version</strong></h4>
<p>The version number is identified by looking at the most significant 4 bits of the value in the M position.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following table lists the currently defined versions:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1ePxhp-OP2JdmdHVLd3rbfDc9dcNP5J9QQncT0bYPdJ5W3_2pAHfGZ9a7Q7m3mav6VA1syO22nTIavepVicTMW9YxqiuGcSePUOanJeyz67K_bZwDbd_KO25oLgPirr53qj1wZq9" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<h4><strong>&nbsp;Variant</strong></h4>
<p>The variant field determines the layout of the information embedded in the UUID. The interpretation of all other bits in the UUID depends on the value of the variant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We identify the variant by considering the first 1-3 most significant bits of N.&nbsp;</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FeXxFJcHdVVJA7IorpHtQx67F3eiSkMJVAr2Q5E4t3IierXggi-DR1uthMBOgRBXRP4JzcdRMuHbVqMMkCWZ47fo7sUO8sDBQcwgALwr45qLdpC9bSUBoXKQF9Bhdnnc9kN-g8p9" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>The most common implementation nowadays is Variant 1 where the MSB0&nbsp; is fixed as 1 and MSB1 is fixed as 0. This means that considering our wildcard values – the bits marked with an <code>x</code> above – the only possible values are 8, 9, A, or B.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Quick Reminder:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>1 0 0 0 = 8&nbsp;</p><p>1 0 0 1 = 9</p><p>1 0 1 0 = A</p><p>1 0 1 1 = B</p></blockquote>
<p>So, if you ever see a UUID with these values in the N position, you’ll know it’s the common Variant 1 type.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Version 1 (Time Based + Unique or Random Host Identifier)&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>In this version, the UUID is generated by taking the current timestamp and some identifying property of the device generating the UUID – most commonly, the MAC address (also called the node ID).&nbsp;</p>
<p>This UUID is generated by concatenating the 48 bit MAC address, a 60 bit-timestamp, and a 14 bit “uniquifying” clock sequence, along with the 6 reserved bits for version and variant to generate a unique UUID.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>The clock sequence is simply a value incremented every time the clock is modified.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>The timestamp used in this version is the number of 100 nanosecond time intervals since October 15, 1582 – the date of Gregorian reform to the Christian calendar.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>You may be familiar with Unix systems and time since epoch. This is simply just a different Day 0. There are several algorithms online that allow you to convert one time representation to the other, so we won’t go over this here.</p></blockquote>
<p>Though this implementation seems fairly straightforward and robust, because it reveals the MAC address of the machine it was generated on, this approach is not suitable for all use cases.&nbsp; Especially, when security is a major concern. Instead, some implementations will use 6 random bytes sourced from a cryptographically secure random number generator as a replacement for the node ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;To assemble a Version 1 UUID, we’ll do the following steps:&nbsp;</p>
<ol><li>Take the low 32 bits of the current UTC timestamp. This will be the first 4 bytes / 8 hex characters of our UUID [TimeLow]</li><li>Take the middle 16 bits of the current UTC timestamp. These will be the following 2 bytes / 4 hex characters. [TimeMid]</li><li>The next 2 bytes / 4 hex characters will concat the 4 bit UUID version with the remaining high 12 bits of the current UTC timestamp (which is 60 bits in total). [TimeHighAndVersion]</li><li>Now, the next 1-3 bits will specify the variant of the UUID version. The remaining bits will contain the clock sequence which is meant to contribute some small amount of randomness to this implementation. In doing so, it helps avoid collisions in the event multiple UUID generators are running on the same system, a system clock for a UUID generator is set backwards, or the system clock doesn’t advance fast enough. [ClockSequenceHiAndRes &amp;&amp; ClockSequenceLow]</li><li>The final 6 bytes / 12 hex characters / 48 bits are the “node id” which is most commonly the MAC address of the issuing device. [NodeID]</li></ol>
<p>Putting everything together, our Version 1 UUID is generated by concatenating:</p>
<p><code>TimeLow + TimeMid + TimeHighAndVersion + (ClockSequenceHiAndRes &amp;&amp; ClockSequenceLow) + NodeID&nbsp;</code></p>
<p>Due to this implementation’s reliance on the clock, there are some edge cases we’ll need to handle. Firstly, to minimize correlation across systems, the clock sequence is defaulted to a random number – this will only happen once in the lifetime of a system. This has the added benefit of allowing us to support node identifiers that may move from system to system as the initial value of the clock sequence is completely agnostic of the node identifier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that the main purpose of the clock sequence is to introduce some amount of randomness into the equation. The bits allocated for the clock sequence help us extend the timestamp and account for situations where multiple UUIDs are generated before the processor clock advances. This helps us avoid the potential creation of duplicates when the clock is set backwards in time (device is powered off) or the node ID changes. If the clock is set backwards, or might have been set backwards (e.g., while the system was powered off), and the UUID generator can not be sure that no UUIDs were generated with timestamps larger than the value to which the clock was set, then the clock sequence has to be changed. If the previous value of the clock sequence is known, it can just be incremented; otherwise it should be set to a random or high-quality pseudo-random value.</p>
<h4><strong>Version 2 (Distributed Computing Environment Security)</strong></h4>
<p>The main difference between this version and Version 1 is that this implementation uses some identifier specific to the system in place of the “randomness” generated by using the least significant bits of the clock sequence. This value is often just the current user’s ID. This version is less common and only a small deviation from Version 1, so we won’t explore it any further.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Version 3 (Name-based + MD5 Hash)</strong></h4>
<p>In the event that you want to have unique identifiers for information within a namespace or for “nameable” information more generally, UUID version 3 and version 5 are your preferred options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They’ll encode any “nameable” entity (website, DNS information, plain text, etc) into the UUID value. The main takeaway here is that for the same namespace and text, the generated UUID will be the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take note that the namespace itself is a UUID.</p>
<pre><code>let namespace = “digitalbunker.dev”
let namespaceUUID = UUID3(.DNS, namespace)

// Ex: 
UUID3(namespaceUUID, “/category/things-you-should-know-1/”) 
4896c91b-9e61-3129-87b6-8aa299028058

UUID3(namespaceUUID, “/category/things-you-should-know-2/”) 
29be0ee3-fe77-331e-a1bf-9494ec18c0ba

UUID3(namespaceUUID, “/category/things-you-should-know-3/”) 
33b06619-1ee7-3db5-827d-0dc85df1f759
</code></pre>
<p>In this implementation, the UUID of the namespace is transformed to a string of bytes, concatenated with the input name, then hashed with MD5, yielding the 128 bits for the UUID. Then, we’ll overwrite some of those bits to accurately reflect the version and variant information leaving the rest unchanged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s also important to understand that neither the namespace nor the inputted name can be generated from the UUID. This is a one-way operation. The only exception here would be through a brute force approach if one of the values (namespace or text) were known by the attacker.</p>
<p>For Version 3 and Version 5, as long as you use the same inputs, the generated UUID will be deterministic.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Version 4 (PRNG)</strong></h4>
<p>This is probably the simplest implementation of the bunch.</p>
<p>As we’ve now seen, 6 bits are reserved for the version and variant information leaving us 122 bits free to decide. This version simply generates all 128 random bits and then fills in the values for the version and variant information as a secondary step.&nbsp;</p>
<p>UUIDs of this variety rely heavily on the quality of the PRNG in use (pseudo-random number generator). If the PRNG is lacking a sophisticated algorithm or the correct seed and initialization values, the likelihood of a duplicate can increase. To better understand how computers generate random numbers, <a href="https://digitalbunker.dev/2020/09/08/how-do-computers-generate-random-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out my previous article.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Version 4 is what you’ll find most commonly implemented in modern programming languages.</p>
<p>It’s implementation is reasonably simple.&nbsp;</p>
<ol><li>Generate 128 random bits</li><li>Now, we’ll need to overwrite some of these bits with the correct version and variant information&nbsp;<ol><li>Take the 7th byte and perform an AND operation with <code>0x0F</code> to clear out the high nibble. Then, OR it with <code>0x40</code> to set the version number to 4.&nbsp;</li><li>Next, take the 9th byte and perform an AND operation with <code>0x3F</code> and then OR it with <code>0x80</code>.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>Convert the 128 bits to hexadecimal representation and insert the hyphens to achieve the canonical text representation.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<h4><strong>Version 5 (Name-based + SHA-1 Hash)</strong></h4>
<p>This version is no different than Version 3 with the exception that the <code>SHA-1</code> hashing algorithm is used here in place of <code>MD5</code>. This version is preferred to Version 3 (SHA-1 &gt; MD5).&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>In Practice</strong></h2>
<p>One of the notable benefits of UUIDs is that their uniqueness does not depend on a central authority or coordination between different systems. Anyone can create UUIDs with reasonable assurance that a duplicate value does not exist and will conceivably not be made in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has the added benefit of allowing UUIDs generated by independent parties to be combined into a single database or moved across databases with a trivial probability of duplication / collision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to this uniqueness, you can use UUIDs as primary keys in databases, unique filenames for uploaded files, unique names for any web resource, or …</p></div></div>

<p>The Apple T2 security chip has finally been jailbroken! Here’s all you need to know about it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h2><span id="The_Apple_T2_Security_chip_now_has_a_jailbreak"><strong>The Apple T2 Security chip now has a jailbreak</strong><span></span></span></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://yalujailbreak.net/checkra1n-jailbreak-ios-14/">latest update of checkra1n</a> adds support for bridgeOS – the operating system that powers the Apple T2 security chip.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, the T2 chip is not A10 per se but it is derived from the Apple A10 Fusion architecture.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>bridgeOS</strong> is a proprietary operating system created by Apple for its hardware. It is responsible for operating the Touch Bar and managing secure data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s what hacker Jamie Bishop had to say about this development.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">With <a href="https://twitter.com/checkra1n?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">@checkra1n</a> 0.11.0, you can now jailbreak the T2 chip in your Mac. An incredible amount of work went into this and it required changes at multiple levels.</p>
<p>There’s too many people to tag, but shoutout to everyone who worked on getting this incredible feature shipped.</p>

<p>Since checkra1n is still in beta, there are a few issues you need to be aware of. Firstly, you might have to reconnect your device after jailbreaking for bootstrap upload.</p>
<p>Secondly, macOS takes over the USB connection and blocks communication after bootup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are interested in jailbreaking the T2 chip, download checkra1n jailbreak v0.11 from this <a href="https://yalujailbreak.net/checkra1n-jailbreak-ios-14/">link</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span id="What_can_a_bridgeOS_jailbreak_be_used_for"><strong>What can a bridgeOS jailbreak be used for?&nbsp;</strong><span></span></span></h2>
<p>The T2 security processor and the Touch Bar can run while the operating system is shutdown.</p>
<p>Apparently, jailbreak tweak developers could develop tweaks for the Touch Bar if it gets Substrate support in the future.</p>
<p>At present, there are no publicly dumped headers available for bridgeOS. It lacks a MobileSubstrate port too. However, that could change in the future because it shares some of the components of watchOS and iOS frameworks.</p>
<p>Once we get Substrate working, <strong>tweaking and theming could become possible.</strong></p>

<p>The ability to exploit the T2 processor could also allow you to bypass the anti-repair mechanism built into the Touch Bar. Further, it may allow hackers to get rid of the password or unlock MDM-locked systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as the OS goes, we could also add secure boot certificates like Microsoft’s secure boot signing or a self-signed Linux certificate.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>It will definitely be interesting to see what the future holds for the <em>T2 security chip</em> following the release of checkra1n.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Don’t forget to follow us on Twitter and Facebook for the latest jailbreak news and updates.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The C++ STL may be the most impressive achievement in language standard libraries. Where most programmers are stuck complaining that their language’s default strings aren’t performant enough, about every standard C++ function for strings actually runs on arbitrary character sequences. Design your own container? <span>std::find_if</span> works just as well as for the built-ins. And it does this while often being more performant than the code you’d write yourself.</p>

<p>Alex Stepanov is the man who made this happen, and Elements of Programming (EOP) is his 200-page paean to his method for writing generic code. He’s a believer that programming can be turned from an art to a rigorous discipline based on mathematics, and I’ve long admired him for his deep knowledge and impact. Indeed, he’s spent years at  #1 on my list of people I’d like to have lunch with. (Hey readers — can anyone help?)</p>

<p>And now, I’m about to ruin all that by writing a negative review.</p>

<p>EOP has a strong beginning and a strong finish. The first chapter explains core programming language concepts such as types and state — using non-standard terminology, but probably intentionally, judging by the explanation’s lucidity. This culminates in his big idea of being able to write programs on any type that offers a bundle of operations and properties called a concept, explained in this book over a decade before they entered the C++ standard. The afterword is a few pages of reflection on the power of this approach.</p>

<p>Between them is 11 chapters where he plays the same game: define a new abstraction and then show a bunch of functions that can be written using it. And unfortunately, these functions and abstractions are largely not very interesting.</p>

<p>There’s a famous site called Project Euler, where users write code to solve mathy problems such as “In a modified version of the board game Monopoly, on what three squares is a player most likely to land?” My former programming-contest coach advocated against using it to practice, because “It’s not really programming, and it’s not really math.”</p>

<p>I think this is an apt description of EOP, particularly the first half. This starts from Chapter 2, which is about cool algorithms that involve applying some function to itself repeatedly (iteration). One of my <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cdm/pdf/lect-05.pdf">favorite lectures</a> in undergrad was on this topic, and yet I still couldn’t enjoy this chapter, as I know no application of these algorithms outside of niche mathematical topics. This gets taken up another notch in Chapter 5, where, in about 5 pages, he goes from explaining commutativity to defining the algebraic structures of monoids, groups, and rings, all the way up to algebraic modules (no relation to software modules). I cannot fathom these explanations being useful to someone who does not already know these concepts, and certainly not to someone who already does. And while I do know many uses of groups in software engineering — as an abstraction of the idea of an invertible operation — he actually spends the remainder of this chapter considering generalizations of the greatest common divisor function.</p>

<p>I slogged through these chapters, excited for the second half of the book, which focused largely on iterators and containers, things more relevant to typical software engineering. Yet after encountering endless listings of variations of list-copy functions, I found myself no more fulfilled, and soon regressed to skimming through the pages.</p>

<p>Aside from my long-term goal to find all the good writing on software design, I had a short-term goal when reading this book: a student wanted me to teach a lesson based on it. But, halfway through the book, my deadline was fast approaching, and I hadn’t found any material useful enough for a software design lesson for experienced engineers.</p>

<p>I then noticed all the chapters were generated by the deeper principle of coming up with a good abstraction to write generic functions against. I got the idea that maybe I could use EOP as a problem book, telling them to look at the descriptions of generic functions, and then come up with both the code and the abstractions they can be written against. Alas, the topic selection is not suitable for this purpose. One section of the book, for example, deals with computing integer sequences by matrix exponentiation. Asking students to come up with this themselves would be too familiar for many who have taken a linear algebra course, and impossible for those who haven’t. I did design a lesson where students come up with their own abstractions for generic programming problems, but I used examples completely unrelated to the book.</p>

<p>I asked the friend who recommended EOP what he got out of the book, and his first answer was a technique for elegantly expressing state machines using goto’s. I similarly loved that part, but, alas, that was the only concrete thing I got out of this book. I’ll explain it at the end of this review and spare you the other 200 pages.</p>

<p>I have an undergraduate degree in mathematics and have authored several papers on generic programming, so I knew I was reading it for others’ benefit. Still, I don’t think my opinion would be changed were this not the case, and I’d really like help understanding the viewpoint of the many readers who did thoroughly enjoy it. Instead, I find myself agreeing with this Amazon reviewer, although I have too much admiration for Stepanov to contemplate a 1-star rating:</p>

<blockquote>If you've ever written a generic function, you already know that the type parameters must obey a set of preconditions. This book lays out a big pile of definitions for types, numbers, algebraic structures, iterators, and such, so as to bamboozle people easily impressed by mathematical notation. It does so sloppily and writes some trivial generic algorithms in C++. To whatever extent one might accomplish something interesting with this topic, this book doesn't. Avoid.</blockquote>

<p>As I read other material by Stepanov, I mourn for the book that could have been. Stepanov clearly cares about these abstractions and algorithms, to the point where he wrote a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Generic-Programming-Alexander-Stepanov/dp/0321942043">second book</a> on largely the same material, with a chattier exposition and chapters more explicitly focusing on pure math. How different would it be had he managed to transmit this appreciation to me? The day after finishing, I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2tWOdzgXHA&amp;t=1344s">this talk</a> by a close colleague of Stepanov. “In this menu, you can select a bunch of rows and drag them somewhere else,” he explained over animated slides. “How many of you could implement this in one line?” It made me want to open section 10.4 on “rotation algorithms” again.</p>

<p>I’ve started watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHxtyCq_WDLXryyw91lahwdtpZsmo4BGD">a seminar</a> he gave at Amazon. I’m only a few lectures in, but I’m already enthralled by his high teaching ability. I feel like I’m there with him working through problems. I feel like I’ve learned a great secret as he tells the story of how he invented “regular types,” something used throughout EOP but never motivated. To be honest, I still don’t know what this lecture series is about, but nonetheless expect to recommend it when I’m done.</p>

<p>In short, Stepanov has given many gifts to the world of programming, and EOP is not one of them.</p>

<p><b>Overall rating</b>: <span>Not recommended</span></p>

<p>With a smattering of exceptions, EOP neither teaches abstractions useful in everyday programming, nor teaches you the skills to invent your own.</p>

<h2><b>Addendum</b>: State machines by goto’s</h2>

<blockquote>“The fastest way to go from one place in code to another is goto.”</blockquote><p>

— <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp_IBYVqMeQ&amp;list=PLHxtyCq_WDLXryyw91lahwdtpZsmo4BGD">Alexander Stepanov</a></p><p>Many iterative algorithms can be described as state machines: first it looks for an X, then it does Y with it, then it looks for another X, and so on. Rather than trying to massage the cycles in the state machine into structured loops, Stepanov advocates a style using goto’s, with one goto-label per machine state.</p>

<p>In searching for an example to best illustrate this, I wanted something where the code was under 40 lines (which ruled out Stepanov’s examples), understandable with little context or knowledge of C++, and which was not equivalent to a regular expression. And so:</p>

<p>In my defunctionalization talk, I showed that many state machines are derived from recursive functions, being turned into iterative traversals by creating a state for each point in the program between recursive calls. For that talk, I demonstrated this in full for the example of printing a binary tree. It turns out that adding parentheses makes this derivation substantially harder, as an arbitrary number of close-parentheses may need to be printed after processing a node. And that difficulty comes from trying to massage a state machine into a loop.</p>

<p>In this case, seeing as I came up with this example by starring with a recursive function, the recursive version is quite simple:</p>

<div><pre><span>void</span> <span>print_tree_rec</span><span>(tree</span> <span>*</span><span>t)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(t</span> <span>!=</span> <span>NULL)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>printf(</span><span>"("</span><span>);</span>
    <span>print_tree_rec(t</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>left);</span>
    <span>printf(</span><span>" %d "</span><span>,</span> <span>t</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>element);</span>
    <span>print_tree_rec(t</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>right);</span>
    <span>printf(</span><span>")"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>But, for other state machines, the recursive version is not so easy. For example, Dijkstra created the “shunting yard” algorithm for parsing an arithmetic expression all the way back in 1961, yet I’m not aware of the recursive equivalent being discovered <a href="https://www.brics.dk/RS/07/7/BRICS-RS-07-7.pdf">until 2007</a>, using the technique of refunctionalization.</p>

<p>Here’s the state machine:</p><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-068c5e82-7fff-aeae-61d2-74453ca23aeb"><span><span><img height="566" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/bfYT7CeU0eo8KAoMt8gB5Y4FDgD7Y1UlUJYSNI3ndYZ6jQpZv5Nwpyqyqoqffi_tgSRBYslU93EZy_nCil9ub6FZraaRGOBoABGPk0i9DoNbgr1fWAnkQzXMxPvLvEYFSDRWZ1RL" width="572"></span></span></span></p>

<p>A confession: the first time I thought about how to make this recursive function function iterative, I didn’t get it, and had to look it up. The solution is to merge the “Next from stack” state in the diagram with its successors, resulting in a solution with two nested while-loops, at the cost of some duplicated code.</p>

<p>However, the version based on goto’s reads off this diagram rather nicely. One C++-ism in this code to note: while the stack s is initialized to NULL, the  <span>push()</span> and  <span>pop()</span> calls can actually change it.</p>

        <p>This is the third post in our <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/tag/zero-to-main">Zero to main() series</a>,
where we bootstrap a working firmware from zero code on a
cortex-M series microcontroller.</p>

<p>Previously, <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/zero-to-main-1">we wrote a startup file to bootstrap our C environment</a>, and <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/how-to-write-linker-scripts-for-firmware">a linker
script to get the right data at the right addresses</a>. These two will allow us to
write a monolithic firmware which we can load and run on our microcontrollers.</p>

<p>In practice, this is not how most firmware is structured. Digging through vendor
SDKs, you’ll notice that they all recommend using a <em>bootloader</em> to load your
applications. A bootloader is a small program which is responsible for loading
and starting your application.</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->
<p>In this post, we will explain why you may want a
bootloader, how to implement one, and cover a few advanced techniques you may
use to make your bootloader more useful.

<h2 id="why-you-may-need-a-bootloader">Why you may need a bootloader</h2>

<p>Bootloaders serve many purposes, ranging from security to software architecture.</p>

<p>Most commonly, you may need a bootloader to load your software. Some
microcontrollers like Dialog’s
<a href="https://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/products/connectivity/bluetooth-low-energy/smartbond-da14580-and-da14583">DA14580</a>
have little to no onboard flash and instead rely on an external device to store
firmware code. In that case, it is the bootloader’s job to copy code from
non-executable storage, such as a SPI flash, to an area of memory that can be
executed from, such as RAM.</p>

<p>Bootloaders also allow you to decouple parts of the program that are mission
critical, or that have security implications, from application code which
changes regularly.  For example, your bootloader may contain firmware update
logic so your device can recover no matter how bad a bug ships in your
application firmware.</p>

<p>Last but certainly not least, bootloaders are an essential component of a
trusted boot architecture.  Your bootloader can, for example, verify a
cryptographic signature to make sure the application has not been replaced or
tampered with.</p>

<h2 id="a-minimal-bootloader">A minimal bootloader</h2>
<p>Let’s build a simple bootloader together. To start, our bootloader must do two
things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Execute on MCU boot</li>
  <li>Jump to our application code</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ll need to decide on a memory map, write some bootloader code, and update our
application to make it bootload-able.</p>

<h3 id="setting-the-stage">Setting the stage</h3>

<p>For this example, we’ll be using the same setup as we did in our previous Zero
to Main posts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adafruit’s <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3505">Metro M0 Express</a> as our
development board,</li>
  <li>a simple <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2764">CMSIS-DAP Adapter</a></li>
  <li>OpenOCD (the <a href="https://github.com/arduino/OpenOCD">Arduino fork</a>) for
programming</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="deciding-on-a-memory-map">Deciding on a memory map</h3>

<p>We must first decide on how much space we want to dedicate to our bootloader.
Code space is precious - your application may come to need more of it - and you
will not be able to change this without updating your bootloader, so make
this as small as you possibly can.</p>

<p>Another important factor is your flash sector size: you want to make sure you
can erase app sectors without erasing bootloader data, or vice versa.
Consequently, your bootloader region must end on a flash sector boundary
(typically 4kB).</p>

<p>I decided to go with a 16kB region, leading to the following memory map:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>        0x0 +---------------------+
            |                     |
            |     Bootloader      |
            |                     |
     0x4000 +---------------------+
            |                     |
            |                     |
            |     Application     |
            |                     |
            |                     |
    0x30000 +---------------------+
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can transcribe that memory into a linker script:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>/* memory_map.ld */
MEMORY
{
  bootrom  (rx)  : ORIGIN = 0x00000000, LENGTH = 0x00004000
  approm   (rx)  : ORIGIN = 0x00004000, LENGTH = 0x0003C000
  ram      (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 0x00008000
}

__bootrom_start__ = ORIGIN(bootrom);
__bootrom_size__ = LENGTH(bootrom);
__approm_start__ = ORIGIN(approm);
__approm_size__ = LENGTH(approm);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since linker scripts are composable, we will be able to <code>include</code> that memory
map into the linker scripts we write for our bootloader and our application.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that the linker script above declares some variables. We’ll need
those for our bootloader to know where to find the application. To make them
accessible in C code, we declare them in a header file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/* memory_map.h */</span>
<span>#pragma once
</span>
<span>extern</span> <span>int</span> <span>__bootrom_start__</span><span>;</span>
<span>extern</span> <span>int</span> <span>__bootrom_size__</span><span>;</span>
<span>extern</span> <span>int</span> <span>__approm_start__</span><span>;</span>
<span>extern</span> <span>int</span> <span>__approm_size__</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="implementing-the-bootloader-itself">Implementing the bootloader itself</h3>
<p>Next up, let’s write some bootloader code. Our bootloader needs to start
executing on boot and then jump to our app.</p>

<p>We know how to do the first part from our previous post: we need a valid stack
pointer at address <code>0x0</code> , and a valid <code>Reset_Handler</code>  function setting up our
environment at address <code>0x4</code>. We can reuse our previous startup file and linker
script, with one change: we use  <code>memory_map.ld</code> rather than define our own
<code>MEMORY</code> section.</p>

<p>We also need to put our code in the <code>bootrom</code> region from our memory rather than
the <code>rom</code> region in our previous post.</p>

<p>Our linker script therefore looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>/* bootloader.ld */
INCLUDE memory_map.ld

/* Section Definitions */
SECTIONS
{
    .text :
    {
        KEEP(*(.vectors .vectors.*))
        *(.text*)
        *(.rodata*)
        _etext = .;
    } &gt; bootrom
  ...
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To jump into our application, we need to know where the <code>Reset_Handler</code> of the
app is, and what stack pointer to load.  Again, we know from our previous post
that those should be the first two 32-bit words in our binary, so we just need
to dereference those addresses using the <code>__approm_start__</code> variable from our
memory map.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/* bootloader.c */</span>
<span>#include &lt;inttypes.h&gt;
#include "memory_map.h"
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>uint32_t</span> <span>*</span><span>app_code</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uint32_t</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>__approm_start__</span><span>;</span>
  <span>uint32_t</span> <span>app_sp</span> <span>=</span> <span>app_code</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
  <span>uint32_t</span> <span>app_start</span> <span>=</span> <span>app_code</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>];</span>
  <span>/* TODO: Start app */</span>
  <span>/* Not Reached */</span>
  <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next we must load that stack pointer and jump to the code. This will require a
bit of assembly code.</p>

<p>ARM MCUs use the <a href="http://www.keil.com/support/man/docs/armasm/armasm_dom1361289882044.htm"><code>msr</code> instruction
</a> to
load immediate or register data into system registers, in this case the MSP
register or “Main Stack Pointer”.</p>

<p>Jumping to an address is done with a branch, in our case with a <a href="http://www.keil.com/support/man/docs/armasm/armasm_dom1361289866466.htm"><code>bx</code>
instruction</a>.</p>

<p>We wrap those two into a <code>start_app</code> function which accepts our <code>pc</code> and <code>sp</code> as
arguments, and get our minimal bootloader:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/* app.c */</span>
<span>#include &lt;inttypes.h&gt;
#include "memory_map.h"
</span>
<span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>start_app</span><span>(</span><span>uint32_t</span> <span>pc</span><span>,</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>sp</span><span>)</span> <span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>naked</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>__asm</span><span>(</span><span>"           </span><span>\n</span><span>\
          msr msp, r1 /* load r1 into MSP */</span><span>\n</span><span>\
          bx r0       /* branch to the address at r0 */</span><span>\n</span><span>\

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: hardware resources initialized in the bootloader must be de-initialized
before control is transferred to the app. Otherwise, you risk breaking
assumptions the app code is making about the state of the system</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="making-our-app-bootloadable">Making our app bootloadable</h3>

<p>We must update our app to take advantage of our new memory map. This is again
done by updating our linker script to include <code>memory_map.ld</code> and changing our
sections to go to the <code>approm</code> region rather than <code>rom</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>/* app.ld */
INCLUDE memory_map.ld

/* Section Definitions */
SECTIONS
{
    .text :
    {
        KEEP(*(.vectors .vectors.*))
        *(.text*)
        *(.rodata*)
        _etext = .;
    } &gt; approm
  ...
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We also need to update the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/docs/dui0552/latest/the-cortex-m3-processor/exception-model/vector-table"><em>vector
table</em></a>
used by the microcontroller. The vector table contains the address of every
exception and interrupt handler in our system. When an interrupt signal comes
in, the ARM core will call the address at the corresponding offset in the vector
table.</p>

<p>For example, the offset for the Hard fault handler is <code>0xc</code>, so when a hard
fault is hit, the ARM core will jump to the address contained in the table at
that offset.</p>

<p>By default, the vector table is at address <code>0x0</code>, which means that when our chip
powers up, only the bootloader can handle exceptions or interrupts! Fortunately, ARM
provides the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/docs/dui0552/latest/cortex-m3-peripherals/system-control-block/vector-table-offset-register">Vector Table Offset
Register</a>
to dynamically change the address of the vector table. The register is at
address <code>0xE000ED08</code> and has a simple layout:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>31                                  7              0
+-----------------------------------+--------------+
|                                   |              |
|              TBLOFF               |   Reserved   |
|                                   |              |
+-----------------------------------+--------------+
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where <code>TBLOFF</code> is the address of the vector table. In our case, that’s the start
of our text section, or <code>_stext</code>. To set it in our app, we add the following to
our <code>Reset_Handler</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/* startup_samd21.c */</span>
<span>/* Set the vector table base address */</span>
<span>uint32_t</span> <span>*</span><span>vector_table</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uint32_t</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>_stext</span><span>;</span>
<span>uint32_t</span> <span>*</span><span>vtor</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uint32_t</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>0xE000ED08</span><span>;</span>
<span>*</span><span>vtor</span> <span>=</span> <span>((</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>)</span> <span>vector_table</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>0xFFFFFFF8</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One quirk of the ARMv7-m architecture is the alignment requirement for the
vector table, as specified in section B1.5.3 of the <a href="https://static.docs.arm.com/ddi0403/eb/DDI0403E_B_armv7m_arm.pdf">reference
manual</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Vector table must be naturally aligned to a power of two whose alignment value is greater than or equal
to (Number of Exceptions supported x 4), with a minimum alignment of 128 bytes.The entry at offset 0 is
used to initialize the value for SP_main, see The SP registers on page B1-8. All other entries must have bit
[0] set, as the bit is used to define the EPSR T-bit on exception entry (see Reset behavior on page B1-20 and
Exception entry behavior on page B1-21 for details).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our SAMD21 MCU has 28 interrupts on top of the 16 system reserved exceptions,
for a total of 44 entries in the table. Multiply that by 4 and you get 176. The
next power of 2 is 256, so our vector table must be 256-byte aligned.</p>

<h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h3>

<p>Because it is hard to witness the bootloader execute, we add a print line to
each of our programs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/* boootloader.c */</span>
<span>#include &lt;inttypes.h&gt;
#include "memory_map.h"
</span>
<span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>s…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

September 29, 2020 | https://thejollyteapot.com/2020/09/29/nobody-seems-to-give-a-crap-about-google-s-monopoly-on-search-not-even-google | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://thejollyteapot.com/2020/09/29/nobody-seems-to-give-a-crap-about-google-s-monopoly-on-search-not-even-google">archive.org</a>

          <p><a href="https://thejollyteapot.com/2020/09/29/nobody-seems-to-give-a-crap-about-google-s-monopoly-on-search-not-even-google">29 September 2020</a></p>
<p>Quick summary of the situation, from the <a href="https://www.android.com/choicescreen/">Choice Screen webpage on the Android website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On August 2, 2019, following the European Commission’s July 2018 Android decision, Google announced that it would implement a choice screen for general search providers on all new Android phones and tablets shipped into the European Economic Area (<span>EEA</span>) where the Google Search app is pre-installed. This updated Help Center article describes a modified choice screen design that was developed in consultation with the European Commission.</p>
<p>The choice screen will appear during initial device setup and will feature multiple search providers, including Google. An illustrative version of the choice screen follows. Providers may vary by country. […]</p>
<p>Eligible search providers will need to fill out an application form and can bid for inclusion based on an auction. The auction process is explained in greater detail below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering how much this farce has been <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/duckduckgo-blasts-googles-android-choice-screen-says-it-incentivizes-ads">covered</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/googles-no-choice-screen-on-android-isnt-working-says-ecosia-querying-the-eus-approach-to-antitrust-enforcement/">already</a>, I will not repeat what <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-android-choice-screen-eu-duckduckgo-2020-9?IR=T">everybody knows</a>. Instead I will just point out how Google announced the result of the auctions <a href="https://www.android.com/choicescreen-winners/">on the Android website</a>: four sentences, two footnotes, a table listing the<span></span> <span>“</span>winners” per country, a title that reads do-not-give-a-shit, and that’s it.</p>
<p>Also, I don’t think I have ever heard of — <em>check notes</em> — PrivacyWall and info.com.<span></span> <span>’</span>What are they?’, you may ask: they are search engines apparently, and they are the only two search engine options offered to Android users in France that are not Google or Bing. And yes, in case you’re wondering, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfHuZ5qrYX4">Bing is still around</a>. Ecosia, DuckDuckGo, barely appear on the list.</p>
<p>If anything, this whole thing will reinforce Google’s monopoly on search. Users will see this<span></span> <span>’</span>choice screen’ and think:<span></span> <span>“</span><span>OK</span>, so two shady things I don’t know, Bing (laughs), and yep, Google. Why would they even ask me to choose?”</p>
<p>It’s like asking kids who have only ever watched the movie <em>Ratatouille</em> if they want to watch Ratatouille again, or another movie from this list: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2120120/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"><em>Pixels</em></a> (even the kids would know it sucks), <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0257778/?ref_=ttls_li_tt">The Hunchback of Notre Dame <span>II</span>: The Secret of the Bell</a></em> (you’re lucky if the kids even know about the first one), and <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083630/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">The Beastmaster</a></em>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="motivation"><a href="#motivation" aria-label="motivation permalink"></a>Motivation</h2>
<p>Hitting the front page of Hacker News is an incredible source of short-term traffic to your website or article.</p>
<p>According to this <a href="https://thehftguy.com/2017/09/26/hitting-hacker-news-front-page-how-much-traffic-do-you-get" rel="nofollow">article</a>, in 2017, being on the front page brings a sudden influx of between 10k and 30k visitors to your website/article, something many content marketers, product people, and entrepreneurs undoubtedly salivate over, including me.</p>
<p>I occasionally post to Hacker News (with random things and personal stuff) but have never reached the front page before. Therefore, I decided to dig a little deeper into the mechanics of Hacker News and the best approach to take if the sole goal is to hit the front page.</p>
<p>Obviously, a critical part of hitting the front page is submitting an interesting article which resonates with the HN audience. But beyond this, there are other factors at play—timing, title, upvotes, etc.</p>
<h2 id="methodology-a-unique-approach"><a href="#methodology-a-unique-approach" aria-label="methodology a unique approach permalink"></a>Methodology: A unique approach</h2>
<p>I am not the only person to want to know the best approach to hitting the front page. A few people have analyzed data from <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/y-combinator/hacker-news" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google’s Hacker News Dataset</a> on BigQuery to find the best time to submit to Hacker News.</p>
<p>The problem with this approach is that BigQuery doesn’t know how long a post spent on the front page, nor how long it was there for or what position it reached. It can only provide the total number of upvotes.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I wrote a small NodeJS script to poll Hacker News every 2 minutes. Using a Postgres database, I stored every post, user, and upvote over two weeks.</p>
<p>With this information, I compiled a list of useful information and insights below.</p>
<p>Note: To filter out posts that are either flagged or transiently featured, I set an arbitrary duration of 60+ minutes as a time requirement in the top for a post to be considered a “front page post.”</p>
<h2 id="limitations"><a href="#limitations" aria-label="limitations permalink"></a>Limitations</h2>
<p>Obviously, the lack of data (13,159 posts) and time spent collecting data (2 weeks) is the most significant limitation of my results. Nonetheless, I believe the results are still relatively useful, at least for the next few weeks or months.</p>
<h2 id="results"><a href="#results" aria-label="results permalink"></a>Results</h2>
<h3 id="basic-stats"><a href="#basic-stats" aria-label="basic stats permalink"></a>Basic stats</h3>
<ul>
<li>I tracked a total of 13,159 posts over two weeks.</li>
<li>Of these, 1,073 made the front page for more than 60 minutes.</li>
<li>That’s a hit rate of 8.15%</li>
<li>Frontpage posts stayed at the top for an average of 483.3 minutes (8 hours)</li>
<li>30% of posts reaching the front page were posted by users who posted more than once over the two weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> In my opinion, more posts reach the front page than expected and for longer than expected.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-posts-breakdown"><a href="#types-of-posts-breakdown" aria-label="types of posts breakdown permalink"></a>Types of posts breakdown</h3>

<h3 id="hit-rate--of-different-post-types-making-the-front-page"><a href="#hit-rate--of-different-post-types-making-the-front-page" aria-label="hit rate  of different post types making the front page permalink"></a>Hit rate % of different post types making the front page</h3>

<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Interestingly, “Show HN” posts make the front page by proportion very slightly less than “Links,” which goes against previous thought that “Show HN” posts perform better due to an algorithm bias. That being said, there may well be an algorithm bias, just many “Show HN” posts are simply not worth upvoting.</p>
<h3 id="when-is-the-best-day-to-post-to-hacker-news-in-2020"><a href="#when-is-the-best-day-to-post-to-hacker-news-in-2020" aria-label="when is the best day to post to hacker news in 2020 permalink"></a>When is the best day to post to Hacker News in 2020?</h3>

<p>The chart above shows that you should post on the weekend to stand the best chance of reaching the front page of Hacker News. The difference from the worst to the best day is only 3.2%, so there’s not a lot in it.</p>
<p>The weekend likely gives you a higher chance to reach the front page because fewer posts are submitted, probably due to lower traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: If your goal is to reach the front page regardless of traffic, posting on the weekend is your best bet. However, because the difference in chance is relatively low throughout the week, posting on a more popular day might be a better risk-reward ratio based on the considerable difference in the traffic you’d likely receive.</p>
<h3 id="when-is-the-best-time-to-post-to-hacker-news-in-2020"><a href="#when-is-the-best-time-to-post-to-hacker-news-in-2020" aria-label="when is the best time to post to hacker news in 2020 permalink"></a>When is the best time to post to Hacker News in 2020?</h3>

<p>Taking a more granular look at the combined hours of all the posts submitted, the chart above highlights a much more significant difference (10.9%) between the chance of reaching the front page of Hacker News.</p>
<p>The best time to post to Hacker News is between 6 am—12 pm UTC (11 pm—5 am PDT). Again, the reason is likely because this is when the website traffic is at it’s lowest, and therefore the competition is relatively low.</p>
<p>I imagine the US is responsible for most of Hacker News’s web traffic, which lines up with the results above. Therefore, if you are posting a link for a US-specific audience to HN, it’s probably best to pick a different time like 4 pm UTC (9 am PDT), or midnight UTC (5 pm PDT).</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> If your link requires a US-specific audience, post at 4 pm UTC (9 am PDT / 12 pm EDT), or midnight UTC (5 pm PDT). Otherwise, post between 6 am—12 pm UTC (11 pm—5 am PDT) for the best chance of reaching the front page of Hacker News.</p>
<h3 id="when-in-the-best-day-and-time-to-post-to-hacker-news-in-2020"><a href="#when-in-the-best-day-and-time-to-post-to-hacker-news-in-2020" aria-label="when in the best day and time to post to hacker news in 2020 permalink"></a>When in the best day and time to post to Hacker News in 2020?</h3>
<p>Combining both days and hours into a total weekly picture is even more evident when it is best to post. However, please note, the lack of data makes this chart vulnerable to skewed results.</p>

<p>The chart above illustrates wild fluctuations between the different hours of the week. The lowest chance of reaching the front page is 1-2%, and the highest is 18%-27%. That’s a massive difference.</p>
<p>Looking at the chart, below are generally the best days &amp; times to post to Hacker News:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monday:</strong> 1 am—4 pm UTC (6 pm—9 am PDT)</li>
<li><strong>Tuesday, Wednesday &amp; Thursday:</strong> 12 am—6 am &amp; 9 am—12 pm UTC (5 pm—11 pm &amp; 2 am—5 am PDT)</li>
<li><strong>Friday:</strong> 5 am—12 pm UTC (10 pm—5 am PDT)</li>
<li><strong>Saturday:</strong> 4 am—9 am UTC (9 pm—2 am PDT)</li>
<li><strong>Sunday:</strong> 3 am—8 am &amp; 10 am—6 pm UTC (8 pm—1 am &amp; 3 am—11 am PDT)</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are the best times specifically (bear in mind these may not be the case week-in-week-out because the amount of data limits the results):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monday:</strong> 12 pm UTC (5 am PDT)</li>
<li><strong>Tuesday:</strong> 9 am UTC (2 am PDT)</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday:</strong> 10 am UTC (3 am PDT)</li>
<li><strong>Thursday:</strong> 12 pm UTC (5 pm PDT)</li>
<li><strong>Friday:</strong> 8 am UTC (1 am PDT)</li>
<li><strong>Saturday:</strong> 9 am UTC (2 am PDT)</li>
<li><strong>Sunday:</strong> 5 am OR 1 pm (10 pm OR 6 am PDT)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> It’s pretty clear that the best times to post on Hacker News to reach the front page are usually around 6 am UTC (11 pm PDT), 9 am UTC (2 am PDT), or 12 pm UTC (5 am PDT), when the US is asleep.</p>
<p>However, given that 8 hours is the average time spent on the front page, it’s probably best to post at 12 pm UTC on Monday, Thursday, Saturday or Sunday to maximize traffic for when the US wakes up.</p>
<h3 id="how-many-votes-does-a-post-need-to-reach-the-front-page-of-hacker-news-in-2020"><a href="#how-many-votes-does-a-post-need-to-reach-the-front-page-of-hacker-news-in-2020" aria-label="how many votes does a post need to reach the front page of hacker news in 2020 permalink"></a>How many votes does a post need to reach the front page of Hacker News in 2020?</h3>
<p>5.22 is the average number of votes a post needed within an average time of 27.1 minutes to reach the front page for the first time.</p>
<p>Below is a chart of box plots to illustrate the variation of votes required over 24 hours.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this graph clearly shows every post, regardless of time, required at least three upvotes, and for 75% of posts, they never needed more than eight votes to reach the front page of Hacker News.</p>
<p>Expectedly, the range of upvotes required is lower for the first half of the day than the second half, roughly matching up to the timings above.</p>
<p>In some cases, posts required a lot more votes to reach the front page. Presumably, because either the time it took to get these votes was over more time, or there was a lot of competition.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> The votes required to be seen on the front page is relatively small. For the best chance of getting on the front page, you’ll need between 4-6 votes in about 30 minutes, posting in the first half of the day (12 am—12pm UTC).</p>
<h3 id="how-much-karma-do-you-need-to-reach-the-front-page-of-hacker-news-in-2020"><a href="#how-much-karma-do-you-need-to-reach-the-front-page-of-hacker-news-in-2020" aria-label="how much karma do you need to reach the front page of hacker news in 2020 permalink"></a>How much karma do you need to reach the front page of Hacker News in 2020?</h3>
<p>Finally, I thought it would be interesting to see the relationship between karma and reaching the front page of Hacker News.</p>
<p>This first pie chart demonstrates the proportion of posts being posted by users with varying levels of karma.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, over 50% of posts are submitted by users with over 1,000 karma points. However, the largest single segment is by users with little to no karma.</p>

<p>The chart above shows that newer users (0-50 karma) make the front page proportionally less than more experienced users. Interestingly, really experienced users (over 10,000 karma) reached the front page significantly more than experienced users.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> It’s hard to say whether karma has anything to do with rankings. Likely, users with more karma are just better at posting content that resonates with the Hacker News audience.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-bc7fa26ba5a57652a526"><div><p>In 1975, Harold Etling went to eat a steak. Harold, a lifelong rancher, left the meal disappointed. His steak didn't meet his expectations. Harold decided to do something about it. He approached the American Angus Association. In January 1978 in West Salem, Ohio, the brand <a href="https://www.certifiedangusbeef.com/">Certified Angus Beef</a> (CAB) launched.</p><p>In the mid-‘70s the USDA lowered their standards for beef. Less quality control over beef meant that the quality could be lessened. If consumers experienced a wide range of tastes when eating beef it could lead to lower consumer demand. This was the issue that Harold Ettling faced.</p><p>The establishment of the Certified Angus Beef brand would solve this. The American Angus Association would manage the brand. Every piece of meat would need to go through rigorous process.</p><p>The program sold its first piece of beef in October 1978. Right after this sale, the USDA canceled the program. They believed the program was misleading. CAB branded beef sold at a premium, which the USDA thought was unfair marketing.</p><p>Mick Colvin, an employee of the American Angus Association, fought the USDA and won. On April 2nd, 1979, the USDA re-approved the brand. In order to be a CAB, you needed to meet <a href="https://davesjubilee.com/departments/meat">10 standards</a>:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Modest or higher marbling – for the taste it ensures customer satisfaction</p></li><li><p>Medium to fine marbling texture – the white “flecks of flavor” in the beef that ensure consistent flavor and juiciness in every bite</p></li><li><p>“A” Maturity – the youngest classification of product delivers superior color, texture and tenderness</p></li><li><p>10- to 16-square-inch ribeye area</p></li><li><p>Less than 1,000-pound carcass weight</p></li><li><p>Less than 1 inch external fat</p></li><li><p>Superior beef muscling – restricts the influence of less-tender dairy cattle</p></li><li><p>Practically free of capillary rupture – ensures the most visually appealing steak</p></li><li><p>No dark cutters – ensures the most visually appealing steak</p></li><li><p>No neck hump exceeding 2 inches – safeguards against cattle with variability in tenderness</p></li></ul><p>Independent USDA graders determine if the beef meets the proper requirements. In the first few years, the CAB grew slowly. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?ei=k5RzX_XbDIyF9PwPy5ux2AQ&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIECAAQDTIECAAQDTIECAAQDTIECAAQDTIECAAQDTIKCC4QxwEQrwEQDTIECAAQDTIGCAAQDRAeMgYIABANEB4yBggAEA0QHjoECAAQRzoFCAAQkQI6CwguELEDEMcBEKMCOggILhCxAxCDAToFCAAQsQM6CAgAELEDEIMBOggILhDHARCjAjoCCAA6BAgAEEM6CgguEMcBEKMCEEM6AgguOgcILhCxAxBDOhAILhCxAxCDARDHARCjAhBDOgcILhBDEJMCOgcIABCxAxBDOgQILhBDOgUILhCxAzoHCC4QChCTAjoECAAQCjoFCC4QkwI6BAguEAo6BggAEBYQHlCIGFjMIWD-ImgAcAN4AYABqQGIAcIKkgEEMS4xMJgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrIAQXAAQE&amp;oq=mick%20colvin&amp;q=mick%20colvin&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk01A4an2KEZkMMf_XL6Jk0C9hAxEeA%3A1601410195216&amp;uact=5&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi18czulY_sAhWMAp0JHctNDEsQ4dUDCA0">But by, 1983, the program was profitable</a>. The CAB had a leg up on burgeoning competitors. Its tacit endorsement from the USDA was heavily promoted.</p><p>In 2012, <a href="http://www.angus.org/pub/newsroom/releases/101812_SixthRecordSalesYearforTopQualityBeefBrand.html">CAB's growth</a> was far and away above any of its competition:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>16,000 licensed partners</p></li><li><p>$4B in annual consumer sales worldwide</p></li><li><p>10% increase year over year wholesale value of a carcass</p></li></ul><p>The last stat is the most impressive. In 2011, the price of CAB carcass was $180.99/cwt. In 2012, the price was $199.71. This proved that consumers <a href="https://www.beefmagazine.com/blog/cab-nolan-ryan-prove-quality-consistency-pay">cared about the CAB brand</a>. Even with a national cattle shortage in 2012, consumers were willing to pay a premium to buy CAB over non CAB beef. Branding really does work.</p><p>It's a significant reason why consumers equate the word Angus with a higher-quality beef. It's also the reason why many associations have started competing certification programs.</p><p>Take McDonald's for an example. Over the past decade, McDonald's has advertised their hamburgers as <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/should-you-pay-extra-angus-beef-12803768">"made with 100% Angus beef"</a>. However, Angus beef isn't always certified Angus beef. If I wasn't writing this article, I wouldn't have known that. How would the average consumer know that?The CAB says that McDonald's burgers aren't CAB. They issued a statement, "Certified Angus Beef does not go to fast-food restaurants. It’s at the higher-end restaurants,” That's been a defining differentiator of CAB since it's inception: premium beef.</p><p>CAB has positioned the company for a middle-upper class audience. Its customer cares about the quality of its beef, has disposable income and is typically white-collar.</p><p>CAB <a href="https://www.hartinc.com/work/case-studies/cab">hired PR firm</a>, Hart, to ensure it's brand wasn't diluted further by fast-food restaurants. Its goal was simple: remind consumers that CAB was the finest premium beef on the market. They used paid, owned and earned media to tell the story. It featured ranchers working from early morning to late evening raising cattle.</p><p>The campaign worked: </p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>92% aided awareness of the Certified Angus Beef brand reached an all-time high. </p></li><li><p>2 to 1 consumer preference of the brand over competing grades and brands of beef. </p></li><li><p>76% of consumers said they would pay $1 extra per pound for Certified Angus Beef </p></li></ul><p>Today, CAB is recognized as the premium beef in the market. It's combination of superior branding and excellent messaging has succeeded. When you think of premium beef, you think Certified Angus Beef. In the fiscal year 2019, <a href="https://news.certifiedangusbeef.com/certified-angus-beef-brand-announces-15th-consecutive-year-of-growth/">CAB sold 1.25B pounds of meat</a>.</p><p>Harold Etling's bad steak in 1975 led to the creation of a brand with $4B+ of sales. The next time you have a good steak at a restaurant, don't forget to thank Harold Etling. He is probably the reason why.</p></div></div></div>]]>

You know, the kind that takes a long time to debug, but is not glamorous to explain. The whitespace errors; the data format errors. The kind of bug that might torment you for a whole weekend, that you emerge with no victorious war story to tell. This is the kind of bug that types have largely solved in languages like TypeScript and MyPy… but that still lurk at the boundaries of APIs.</p><p>In our <a href="https://www.akitasoftware.com/blog/2020/9/22/faster-better-earlier-catch-breaking-changes-by-diffing-api-behavior?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_09_29_product_update">last blog post</a>, we talked about how to catch cross-service bugs by watching API traffic. In this blog post, we show specifically how checking data formats across APIs can catch some nasty bugs.</p><h2>😈 An Error that Evades Any Type Checker</h2><p>You finish implementing a new feature. Your unit tests pass and you get that rush of excitement. The integration tests go green; you think today is a good day. Your co-worker and #bff Aki give your changes a +1 and your pull request gets merged. For one moment, everything seems right with the world.</p><p>And then, hours later, DISASTER! You’re playing online games with Aki—and doing better than you ever have before—when you get a page. Customer support creates an incident that has to do with&nbsp; your new code. Customers are irate that they can’t log into your website.&nbsp;</p><p>You rush home and, after spending the rest of your night combing through logs and writing more tests, you figure it out. It turns out that you accidentally used phone.ToString() instead of phone.ToInternationalString(), causing you to send a domestic phone number instead of an international phone number as a string to a third-party API. The integration tests didn’t cover this because they mocked out this third-party API. But now you’ve lost your rare chance to beat Aki at Fall Guys—and you’ve also tripped up some of your customers.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1601411332549_54474"><div>

Aki pointed out that even if you adopt language-level type-checking (like TypeScript or MyPy) to catch simple errors, application-level type checking can’t prevent these kinds of errors because it doesn’t check across APIs.&nbsp; And once the type-checked values hit the wire they all get flattened to the same thing, so you would need some sort of magical tool to check across APIs. But what if such a tool existed!</p></div><h2>✅ Find Bugs by Inferring Data Formats</h2><p>Worry no more! We’ve designed Akita to solve exactly this problem of spotting mismatched data formats across the API. With Akita, you can use our data format detection to easily detect issues like this phone number change, without requiring code changes or proxies, simply by allowing Akita to watch your API.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1601411332549_59847"><div>

There might be multiple data formats that a field is eligible for. For instance, `18001112222` could be either a phone number or a time stamp, but a second call to the same endpoint with `1-800-333-4444` makes it clear that parameter is a phone number. A field that accepts strings may accept the occasional email. To infer the most accurate type, Akita compares data from <em>all </em>requests to the same endpoint and identifies the data formats common across all calls.&nbsp; We also use a bit of secret sauce to compare data formats across <em>data flows</em> we detect across your API, but that's the topic of another post.</p><p>Of course, there's always the chance that your API successfully accepts, say, phone numbers and timestamps (or email addresses, country codes, and so on) in the same parameter.&nbsp; In that case, we'll let you know all the data formats that fit the data.</p><p>There are a couple of cool things about how we’re inferring data formats. First, we’re using type inference to infer types at the API level, rather than analyzing source code. Second, we’re inferring specific data formats, with the ability to tell the difference between different phone number formats, on top of simple types like string or int. A bonus is that since Akita automatically infers the entire API spec under the hood, our type inference can use the structure of that spec. More on this in a later post!</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1601411332549_107297"><div>

    <p><img src="https://matej.laitl.cz/images/2020-09-29-bench-actix-rocket/cover.png" alt="illustration">
I present a Rust-specific sequel to my <a href="https://matej.laitl.cz/bench-rust-kotlin-microservices/">previous benchmark of 2 Kotlin and a Rust microservice</a>
â€” itâ€™s hard to resist oneâ€™s own curiosity and popular demand, especially when youâ€™ve been
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/is9onc/what_i_learnt_from_benchmarking_http4k_ktor/g57n93y/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">nerd</a>-<a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">sniped</a>.
Letâ€™s stress-test the two prominent web frameworks: Actix Web and Rocket.
In addition to stable â€œthreads &amp; blocking callsâ€� Rocket v0.4,
I have included a development snapshot of in-the-works Rocket v0.5,
which is async and <a href="https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/commit/56a61726">no longer requires nightly Rust</a>.</p>

<p><em>Impatient? <a href="#results">Jump to the results</a>.</em></p>

<h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>

<p>Iâ€™ll take advantage of the previous article to fully describe
aspects that apply equally well to this round:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://matej.laitl.cz/bench-rust-kotlin-microservices/#on-techempower-framework-benchmarks">How this is different than TechEmpower benchmarks</a>.
<em>TL;DR: we want to capture finer nuances and test idiomatic implementations with error reporting,
logging, etc. â€” rather than highly optimised ones.</em></li>
  <li><a href="https://matej.laitl.cz/bench-rust-kotlin-microservices/#the-service">The microservice weâ€™ve benchmarking</a>.
<em>TL;DR: a simple endpoint that does one call to Elasticsearch server.</em></li>
  <li><a href="https://matej.laitl.cz/bench-rust-kotlin-microservices/#recipe">The testing methodology</a>.
<em>TL;DR: repeated runs of a Python script that spins microservice Docker container
and exposes it to an increasing number of concurrent connections using <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a>.</em></li>
  <li><a href="https://matej.laitl.cz/bench-rust-kotlin-microservices/#runtime-environment">Runtime Environment</a>.
<em>TL;DR: we limit the microservice to 1.5 CPU cores and 512 MiB memory using Docker.</em></li>
  <li><a href="https://matej.laitl.cz/bench-rust-kotlin-microservices/#hardware">Hardware</a>.
<em>TL;DR: Google Cloud Platform VM with 4-core AMD Epyc Rome CPU for the microservice + 12-core machine for the Elasticsearch server.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>We still compile in release mode, target <code>skylake</code>, and utilize <a href="https://deterministic.space/high-performance-rust.html">cheap performance tricks</a>.
What changed is Rust version, we have to use <strong>nightly</strong> because of Rocket v0.4.
More specifically, all implementations are compiled using
<code>rustc 1.47.0-nightly (2d8a3b918 2020-08-26)</code>.<sup id="fnref:nightly" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:nightly">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="actix-v30">Actix v3.0</h2>

<p>Code as benchmarked: <a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs/tree/actix-v30">locations-rs tag <code>actix-v30</code></a>.
Uses <strong>Actix Web 3.0.2</strong>.</p>

<p>Just some small things have changed
since the <a href="https://matej.laitl.cz/bench-rust-kotlin-microservices/#the-story-of-locations-rs">version described in the last post</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We now use version 3.0, but note that <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/strohel-pub/bench-actix-versions/bench-results.html">its performance matches v2.0 in our case</a>.</li>
  <li>OpenAPI (Swagger) support is reintroduced as I was able to <a href="https://github.com/wafflespeanut/paperclip/pull/218">make Paperclip support v3.0, too</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="rocket-v04">Rocket v0.4</h2>

<p>Code as benchmarked: <a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs-rocket/tree/rocket-v04">locations-rs-rocket tag <code>rocket-v04</code></a>.
Uses stable <strong>Rocket 0.4.5</strong>.</p>

<p>Porting from Actix to Rocket v0.4 was a matter of
<a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs-rocket/commit/f37de2fe">one +175 -150 lines commit</a>.<sup id="fnref:lines" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:lines">2</a></sup>
It looks a bit scary but was mostly mechanical:
converting Actix type to Rocketry ones, and then fixing all compiler errors â€”
I love how <code>rustc</code> essentially works as your to-do list.
There was only one major hurdle:</p>

<h3 id="calling-async-functions-from-blocking-handlers">Calling Async Functions from Blocking Handlers</h3>

<p>Rocket v0.4 handlers are classic blocking (sync) functions, but Reqwest-based
<a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-rs">elasticsearch-rs</a> only provides an async API.
Whoops.</p>

<p>The general advice is to propagate the asynchronicity up in caller stack
instead of trying to call async functions from sync code.
But what if we really want to? These are our options:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>global-rt</code>: launch a global <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2/tokio/runtime/index.html#threaded-scheduler">threaded Tokio runtime</a>
alongside Rocket workers.
Then call runtimeâ€™s <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2/tokio/runtime/struct.Handle.html#method.block_on">Handle::block_on()</a>
in endpoint handlers to delegate the work to the global async runtime,
pausing the Rocket worker until the future resolves.</li>
  <li><code>per-worker-rt</code>: create a <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2/tokio/runtime/index.html#basic-scheduler">basic single-threaded Tokio runtime</a>
<em>per each Rocket worker</em>.<sup id="fnref:per-worker" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:per-worker">3</a></sup>
In endpoint handlers then call <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2/tokio/runtime/struct.Runtime.html#method.block_on">Runtime::block_on()</a>,
which here has different semantics (!) than the <code>Handle::block_on()</code> above:
the future, and any other spawned async tasks, actually run within this Rocket worker thread.<sup id="fnref:worker-run" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:worker-run">4</a></sup>
This comes with a caveat.
Reqwest::client() seems to <em>attach</em> itself to the async runtime it is first used in.
I had to make Elasticsearch client also local to each Rocket worker.
Otherwise, I got deadlocks or <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/2112">problems described in hyper issue #2112</a>.</li>
  <li><code>per-req-rt</code>: launch a fresh basic Tokio runtime per each request.
It feels wrong, and it is wrong. Iâ€™ve tried and benchmarked this so that we know <em>how much</em> wrong.</li>
  <li>Patch elasticsearch-rs to provide a blocking API â€” by employing Requestâ€™s
<a href="https://docs.rs/reqwest/0.10/reqwest/blocking/index.html">optional blocking API</a>.
That would be futile, and essentially a sophisticated variant of 2.,
given <a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/blob/v0.10.8/src/blocking/client.rs#L715-L783">the implementation details of the blocking client</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/strohel-pub/rocket-async-approach/bench-results.html"><strong>Here are the results of benchmarking the first three approaches.</strong></a>
Source code of each variant is available under the respective <a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs-rocket/tags">tag in the locations-rs-rocket repository</a>.</p>

<p>You can almost hear the server crying as it tries to cope with the inefficiency of <code>per-req-rt</code>:
it is more than 7âœ• less efficient than the best performing variant.</p>

<p>The other two more realistic variants are close to each other.
<code>per-worker-rt</code> has a slight edge in peak performance and a clear edge in efficiency,
especially for low connection counts.
It is therefore proclaimed a winner of this qualification round
and represents Rocket v0.4 in later benchmarks.</p>

<p>It is not a surprise that highly-optimised Actix uses a similar approach:
independent single-threaded Tokio runtimes per each worker
instead of a global work-stealing threaded one.</p>

<h3 id="keep-alive-connections">Keep-Alive Connections</h3>

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Connection_management_in_HTTP_1.x#Persistent_connections">Keep-Alive (persistent) connections</a>
save latency and resources when a client makes more than one request to a given server,
especially when the connection is secured by TLS.
Unfortunately, Rocket v0.4 is not their friend.</p>

<p><strong>First</strong>, to the best of my knowledge,
<a href="https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/580#issuecomment-698286249">persistent connections donâ€™t work at all in Rocket v0.4</a>
â€” the server closes the connection before reading a second request.
Iâ€™ve <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/2288/commits/3109103">traced the problem down to a bug in BufReader in old hyper 0.10.x and submitted a fix</a>.
In the 0.11.x branch, the same bug was <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/commit/d35992d0198d733c251e133ecc35f2bca8540d96#diff-078f367374debbc894f7cc1c4084e467R64-R66">fixed a long ago</a> and released with 0.11.0 in June 2017.
My pull request was <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/2288#issuecomment-698492487">closed without merging</a>,
as the maintainers were (understandably) not keen on releasing a new version of a legacy branch that was superseded 3 years ago.
In other words, <em>Rocket v0.4 depends on unmaintained hyper</em> for its HTTP handling.</p>

<p><strong>Second,</strong> even if the bug in hyper is patched,
keep-alive connections in hyper 0.10.x are <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/blob/0.10.x/src/server/mod.rs#L282-L351">implemented naÃ¯vely</a>:
the worker thread is kept busy waiting for the client on the persistent connection,
unable to process other requests.
It is therefore easy to (accidentally) trigger denial-of-service
by opening more persistent connections than available workers,
even with the default keep-alive timeout of 5 s.<sup id="fnref:browsers" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:browsers">5</a></sup>
Note that the first problem prevents this second problem from happening. ;-)</p>

<p>Both issues were long resolved in more modern hyper 0.11+,
and therefore in Rocket v0.5-dev which I happen to benchmark too.</p>

<p>If you run Rocket v0.4 in production,
I recommend you to turn off persistent connections in Rocket config (set <code>keep-alive</code> to <code>0</code>)
â€” while most clients retry the failed second request on a persistent connection gracefully,
at least some versions of Python <code>requests</code> and <code>urllib3</code> were raising exceptions instead.
If you care about latency, I suggest you put an HTTP load-balancer in front of Rocket v0.4 server
to reintroduce persistent connections at least to the client &lt;-&gt; load-balancer hop.</p>

<p><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/strohel-pub/rocket-keep-alive/bench-results.html"><strong>The benchmarks show that disabling keep-alive causes only a mild performance hit in our case.</strong></a></p>

<p>The red <code>oneshot-*</code> line is Rocket with keep-alive disabled and 16 workers,
while other <code>persistent-*</code> lines represent Rocket with patched hyper, enabled keep-alive, and 16, 32 and 64 workers.
It can be seen that disabling keep-alive hurts latency, but not necessarily throughput
â€” if the number of connections can be increased.
Note that the effect will be more pronounced in reality,
real network latencies are much more significant than that of our loopback interface.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <code>wrk</code> does not indicate that some of its concurrent connections have failed to connect to the server at all.
But another demonstration of the denial-of-service behaviour is present when keep-alive is enabled:
Notice how the latencies of the 16-, 32-, and 64-worker instances of Rocket <em>cut-off</em> at
16, 32, respectively 64 concurrent connections.
When such saturation happens,
it is indeed impossible to make a new connection using e.g. <code>curl</code> to the Rocket instance.</p>

<p>Because of these 2 problems, Rocket v0.4 has keep-alive disabled in all other benchmarks.</p>

<h3 id="tuning-the-number-of-workers">Tuning The Number of Workers</h3>

<p>If you want to squeeze the highest possible efficiency from a Rocket v0.4 instance,
you should tweak the number of its worker threads.
The optimal count will depend mainly on the number of available CPU cores,
and the ratio of time your endpoints spend CPU-crunching and waiting for I/O.</p>

<p><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/strohel-pub/rocket-worker-count/bench-results.html"><strong>Here I have benchmarked worker counts from 8 to 256.</strong></a></p>

<p>Instance with 16 workers is the most efficient, although the differences are small.
Most notable variance is, as expected, in memory consumption.
Having in mind that 1.5 CPUs is available the microservice, we arrive at around 10 workers per core.
Rocketâ€™s default is more conservative 2 workers per core.</p>

<h2 id="rocket-v05-dev">Rocket v0.5-dev</h2>

<p><em><strong>Big fat warning</strong>: Rocket v0.5 is still under development.
Version tested in this post is its <a href="https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/commit/1369dc4">1369dc4 commit</a>.
A lot of things may change in the final release, including all observations here.
You can track Rocket v0.5 progress in its <a href="https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/1065">async migration tracking issue</a>
and related GitHub milestone.</em></p>

<p>Code as benchmarked: <a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs-rocket/tree/rocket-v05-dev">locations-rs-rocket tag <code>rocket-v05-dev</code></a>.</p>

<p>Porting from async Actix to async Rocket v0.5-dev was even easier than to Rocket v0.4.
<a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs-rocket/commit/879cd88">Here is the 147 insertions, 140 deletions commit that did the job</a>.<sup id="fnref:lines:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:lines">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Compared to v0.4, Rocket v0.5-dev is <em>boring</em>, in the best possible sense of the word.
Persistent connections are without problems.
There is no need to fiddle with the number of workers.
I attribute this to porting to up-to-date hyper 0.13.x and async Rust ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>All graphs below are interactive and infinitely scalable SVGs â€” zoom in if necessary.</p>

<p>The startup time is measured from the moment Docker finishes setting up the container
to the moment when we receive a valid HTTP response to <code>GET /</code>.</p>

<p>No real difference, single-digit milliseconds correspond to the required round-trip to Elasticsearch server.</p>

<p>Error response ratio in percents.</p>

<p>Nicely flat for all frameworks up to extreme 1024 and 2048 connections.
Actix manages to be slightly better there with ~1% of errors, compared to ~1.5% of both Rocket versions.</p>

<p>High-water mark <em>successful</em> requests per second as the number of concurrent connections grows, one of our main metrics.</p>

SkyGrid, a Boeing, SparkCognition company, today launched a new application for drone operators and enterprises to automate every phase of flight in one unified solution.&nbsp;</p><p>Now available for free in the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D2931428-1%26h%3D455054367%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fapps.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fskygrid-flight-control%252Fid1500582074%26a%3DiPad%2BApp%2BStore&amp;t=Y2Y3ZWYyM2RkMmI1YTRhNTJhYjQwM2FkYTNkZWJlZTAxYjJlMDdjNCxWcXYzazRZeA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F630634164690075648%2Fskygrid-drone-automation-app&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1601670382">iPad App Store</a>, <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skygrid.com%2Fflight-control%2F%3Futm_source%3Dskygrid%26utm_medium%3Dpressrelease%26utm_campaign%3Dflightcontrol&amp;t=ZjU1NmViMzg2ZTM0NTEyMjBjZjg5MGUyOTFhZDFlMTZhYzE0ZTc3ZixWcXYzazRZeA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F630634164690075648%2Fskygrid-drone-automation-app&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1601670382">SkyGrid Flight Control</a>&nbsp;simplifies mission planning and execution, allowing drone operators to autonomously surveil a defined area and detect objects in real-time. Powered by artificial intelligence (AI) computer vision, the solution enables more efficient search and rescue missions, disaster response, perimeter surveillance, site inspections, and more.

<br></p><p>“Traditionally, drone operators have used several different tools to check airspace, get LAANC, plan and execute flights, and gather insights, but it’s a manual, cumbersome process,” said Amir Husain, CEO and founder of SkyGrid. “Recognizing this challenge, SkyGrid has minimized the burden on drone operators by creating one solution that automates airspace, flights, and insights. As the only drone solution built on AI and blockchain technologies, we give operators and enterprises the assurances they need to execute safe, compliant missions.”</p><p>Powered by SkyGrid’s AerialOS, SkyGrid Flight Control enables drone operators to automate airspace authorization, mission planning, flight execution, and object detection in one end-to-end solution. The following features and functionality are available for free within the iPad application:</p><ul><li><b>Airspace intelligence:</b> Provides a map of airspace classes, boundaries, temporary flight restrictions, notices to airmen, and other advisories.</li><li><b>Ground intelligence: </b>Displays population density, obstacles, elevation, and more.</li><li><b>Advanced weather data:</b> Details hyper-local precipitation, wind speed and direction, temperature, cloud cover, and more.</li><li><b>Real-time airspace authorization:</b> Automates authorization to fly in U.S. controlled airspace under 400 feet through integration with the Federal Aviation Administration’s Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) 4.0.</li><li><b>Automated mission planning:</b> Automatically generates area exploration, waypoint, and multi-objective missions based on custom flight parameters, such as desired speed, altitude, and location.</li><li><b>Autonomous flight execution:</b> Autonomously launches the drone and performs the pre-defined flight plan.</li><li><b>AI object recognition:</b> Detects objects in real-time as a drone surveils the defined area with AI computer vision.</li></ul><p>More advanced enterprise features are also available for organizations to better manage all drones, pilots, and airspace operations. These features include AI-based mission planning and rerouting, multi-drone missions, custom object detection and counting, geofencing and alerts, and more.</p><p>“SkyGrid Flight Control is an important stepping-stone to enable more complex commercial drone operations and advanced air mobility in urban, regional, and global markets,” said Steve Nordlund, vice president and general manager of Being NeXt and executive board advisor of SkyGrid. “SkyGrid is solving complex problems in unmanned aviation with a system that will safely integrate the future volume of drones, passenger air vehicles, and other autonomous aircraft in the global airspace.”</p><p>–</p><p><i>Header image:&nbsp;SkyGrid Flight Control.

					<p>Interviewing for any technical position generally requires preparing, studying and long-all day interviews. As a data engineer, what we need to study is not always clear. Some positions require Hadoop, others SQL, some roles require understanding statistics while still others require heavy amounts of system design.</p>
<p>We have gathered many of the resources that we have used to study and get jobs at companies int the FAANG family as well as other major tech companies. We have yet to find one that requires you to know anything about Hadoop during the interview so that has not bee included in this study guide.</p>
<p>However, as part of this study guide we have created the checklist. Sometimes, studying for interviews can feel like you are getting nothing done. Thus, this checklist will help you keep track so you know where to improve and what you have done.<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GOO4s1NcxCR8a44F0XnsErz5rYDxNbHAHznu4pJMRkw/edit?usp=sharing"> You can find the checklist here.</a></p>

<h3><strong>SQL&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><span>As a data engineer it is almost inevitable that you will get some SQL questions. As someone who has participated in many interviews for a lot of top tech companies like Amazon and Capital One. They usually follow some similar patterns. </span></p>
<p><span>Typically there will be at least one question that requires an aggregation with a filter, another that requires a few joins and then one that requires a subquery. Along with that, there might be a few curve ball questions that require self-joins, recursions and analytic functions. So let’s look at a couple concepts that are good to cover</span></p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.coriers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/d1e66b8f46fed3b4fb839e9b41025f82.gif?resize=450%2C164&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="450" height="164" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h4>SQL Pre-Video Problems</h4>
<p>These first few problems will help you gauge where you are on different concepts. That way you can take notes on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GOO4s1NcxCR8a44F0XnsErz5rYDxNbHAHznu4pJMRkw/edit?usp=sharing">study guide</a> and go back and review what you feel you were not comfortable with.</p>
<h4><strong>Join with Aggregation</strong></h4>
<p><strong><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/trips-and-users/">262.&nbsp;Trips and Users</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> The <code>Trips</code>&nbsp;table holds all taxi trips. Each trip has a unique Id, while Client_Id and Driver_Id are both foreign keys to the Users_Id at the&nbsp;<code>Users</code>&nbsp;table. Status is an ENUM type of (‘completed’, ‘cancelled_by_driver’, ‘cancelled_by_client’).</p>
<p><span>This is usually the 3rd or 4th style of question.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Sql Questions With Complex Logic</strong></h4>
<p><span>Sometimes, you get lucky and only have to deal with SQL questions that involve one point o logic. Sometimes it gets a little trickier. For instance this question asks you to both find cities with 3 consecutive rows and has populations over 100. </span></p>
<p><span>This is usually pretty easy to do when you are working, but can sometimes be a little difficult when you are in the middle of an interview.</span></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/human-traffic-of-stadium/">601. Human Traffic of Stadium</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> X city built a new stadium, each day many people visit it and the stats are saved as these columns:&nbsp;<b>id</b>,&nbsp;<strong>visit_</strong><b>date</b>,&nbsp;<b>people</b></p>
<p>Please write a query to display the records which have 3 or more consecutive rows and the amount of people more than 100(inclusive).</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/department-top-three-salaries/">185.&nbsp;Department Top Three Salaries</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Problem: </strong>Write a SQL query to find employees who earn the top three salaries in each of the department. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows (order of rows does not matter).</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/rising-temperature/">197.&nbsp;Rising Temperature</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Problem: </strong>Given a&nbsp;<code>Weather</code>&nbsp;table, write a SQL query to find all dates’ Ids with higher temperature compared to its previous (yesterday’s) dates.</p>

<h4><strong>Advanced Join</strong></h4>
<p><strong><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/exchange-seats/">626. Exchange Seats</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Problem: </strong>Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table&nbsp;<code>seat</code>&nbsp;storing students’ names and their corresponding seat ids.</p>
<p>The column&nbsp;<b>id</b>&nbsp;is continuous increment.</p>
<p>Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.</p>
<p>Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?</p>

<h4><strong>Simple Joins</strong></h4>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-report/problem">The Report</a></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Problem: </strong>Ketty</em>&nbsp;gives&nbsp;<em>Eve</em> a task to generate a report containing three columns: <em>Name</em>,&nbsp;<em>Grade</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Mark</em>.&nbsp;<em>Ketty</em>&nbsp;doesn’t want the NAMES of those students who received a grade lower than&nbsp;<em>8</em>. The report must be in descending order by grade — i.e. higher grades are entered first. If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned to them, order those particular students by their name alphabetically. Finally, if the grade is lower than 8, use “NULL” as their name and list them by their grades in descending order. If there is more than one student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, order those particular students by their marks in ascending order.</p>
<p>Write a query to help Eve.<img src="https://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=GjbDpcHcs4w&amp;bids=507388.2192850&amp;type=2&amp;subid=0" width="1" height="1"><br>

<h4><strong>Ranking, Row Numbers And Analytic Functions</strong></h4>
<p><strong><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/nth-highest-salary/">177.&nbsp;Nth Highest Salary</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Problem: </strong>Write a SQL query to get the&nbsp;<em>n</em><sup>th</sup>&nbsp;highest salary from the&nbsp;<code>Employee</code>table.<br>
<img src="https://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=GjbDpcHcs4w&amp;bids=596027.816&amp;type=4&amp;subid=0" width="1" height="1"></p>
<h4>Complex Self Joins</h4>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/symmetric-pairs/problem">Symmetric Pairs</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Problem: </strong>You are given a table,&nbsp;<em>Functions</em>, containing two columns:&nbsp;<em>X&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Y</em>.</p>
<p>Two pairs&nbsp;<em>(X<sub>1</sub>, Y<sub>1</sub>)</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>(X<sub>2</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>)</em>&nbsp;are said to be&nbsp;<em>symmetric</em>&nbsp;<em>pairs</em>&nbsp;if&nbsp;<em>X<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;= Y<sub>2</sub></em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>X<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;= Y<sub>1</sub></em>.</p>
<p>Write a query to output all such&nbsp;<em>symmetric</em>&nbsp;<em>pairs</em>&nbsp;in ascending order by the value of&nbsp;<em>X</em>.</p>
<p><span>If you need more SQL try these one as well:</span></p>

<h3>Self Practice Problems:</h3>
<p>For this part of your interview practice we are going to list out a few business systems that you can try to design out. First we recommend designing a relational database, then thinking about how you would design an ETL and DW that rely on that relational DB.</p>
<p>*In addition, we have found it very common that interviewers will base their interview questions off of your design. So think about some of the questions you could answer with your DB and list them out.</p>
<p>Design a Database/ETL and DW for a:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dating App</li>
<li>Bicycle Rental Service</li>
<li>Music Streaming App</li>
<li>Job Search Website</li>
<li>Udemy like website</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few ideas. We hope they help you have a clearer idea of what you can practice modeling and designing. Take some time to think about how users interact with these websites before getting started.</p>

<h2>Programming Problems</h2>
<p>Data engineers do a significant amount of programming in there daily life. There are several specific languages data engineers use. In particular, Python is arguable the most common.</p>
<p>If the role requires a lot of Hadoop work, then Java is also a useful language to have. There are a few other useful languages like Java and Powershell (if you work at a Microsoft shop).</p>
<p>There are two types of questions we have experienced. Some interviewers will ask you more operational questions. Others will ask classic algorithm and data structure questions.</p>

<p>Below are list of them…</p>
<h3>Algorithms And Data Structures</h3>
<p>Before going to deep into data structure and algorithms. Let’s do a quick check to see how you are currently doing in this area. We have listed out 8 leetcode problems that vary in difficulty. Try these out and try to gauge yourself on how long it takes you as well as how many hints you needed. If you are following along with the study guide, then note this down. At the end of this list are a few more questions. So once you have watched all the videos, consider doing those problems and see if you feel like you are improving!</p>

September 29, 2020 | http://iamkush.me/how-india-censors-the-web/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://iamkush.me/how-india-censors-the-web/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p><b>Update (11th April 2020): This paper has been accepted at <a href="https://websci20.webscience.org/">ACM Web Science 2020</a>. A preprint can be accessed on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.08590.pdf" target="_blank">arXiv</a>.</b></p>

<p>Nation states around the world engage in web censorship using a variety of legal and technical methods. India is no different in this regard: the Government of India can legally order internet service providers (ISPs) operating in its jurisdiction to block access to certain websites for its users. This makes the situation different from jurisdictions like Iran and China, where internet censorship is largely centralised. Legal provisions in India, namely Section 69A and Section 79 of the Information Technology (IT) Act, allow the Central Government and the various courts in the country to issue website-blocking orders that ISPs are legally bound to comply with. <strong>Most of these orders are not publically available</strong>.</p>

<p>Recent events and the opaque nature of internet censorship in India motivated us at <a href="https://cis-india.org/" target="_blank">The Center for Internet and Society</a> to study India's censorship mechanism in detail. We spent the last year trying to answer two questions pertaining to how internet users in India experience web censorship:</p>

<ol>  
<li>What are the technical methods of censorship used by ISPs in India?</li>  
<li>Are all ISPs blocking the same websites?</li>  
</ol>

<p><strong>Our work has been so far the largest study of web censorship in India</strong>, both in terms of the number of censorship mechanisms that we test for and the number of potentially-blocked websites (PBWs). </p>

<h3 id="datacuration">Data curation</h3>

<p>We compiled a list of PBWs from three sources:  </p>

<ul>  
<li><b>Government orders</b>: A website/URL blocking order may come from the Government of India (Section 69A, IT Act). These orders are usually not in the public domain, as a confidentiality clause prevents any party from disclosing its contents. We collect published and leaked Government orders.</li>  
<li><b>Court orders</b>: The various courts in India also have the power to issue website blocking orders (Section 79, IT Act). Not all such orders are available in the public domain. However, the Government and BSNL (a public company operating as an ISP) have provided portions of this list when under pressure to respond to Right to Information (RTI) requests.</li>  
<li><b>User reports</b>: <a href="https://internetfreedom.in/" target="_blank">The Internet Freedom Foundation</a> collects and publishes reports from internet users who notice blocked websites.</li>  
</ul>

<p>Collecting data from these sources led to a total of 9673 unique URLs, which yielded 5798 unique websites. To limit ourselves to active websites, we exclude all websites for which we could not resolve via Tor circuits, culminating in a corpus of 4379 PBWs.</p>

<h3 id="networktestsfordetectingcensorship">Network tests for detecting censorship</h3>

<p>We designed four network tests that probe the existence of censorship at the DNS, TCP, HTTP, and TLS level. For the sake of brevity, I'll skip elaborating on the tests in this post; the details can be found in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.08590.pdf" target="_blank">preprint</a>.</p>

<p>We run these tests for each website in our corpus from connections of six different ISPs (Jio, Airtel, Vodafone, MTNL, BSNL, and ACT), <strong>which together serve more than 98% of Internet users in India</strong>. Our findings not only confirm that ISPs are using different techniques to block websites, but also demonstrate that different ISPs are not blocking the same websites.</p>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>

<p>In terms of censorship methods, our results confirm that ISPs in India are at liberty to use any technical filtering mechanism they wish: there was, in fact, no single mechanism common across ISPs. </p>

<p>We observe ISPs to be using a melange of techniques for blocking access, such as DNS poisoning and HTTP host header inspection. <b>Our tests also discern the use of SNI inspection being employed by the largest ISP in India (Jio) to block HTTPS communication, the use of which is previously undocumented in the Indian context</b>.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vDAgGnf.png" alt="img">
</p><center>Censorship techniques employed by Indian ISPs</center>

<p>Further, we notice that all ISPs using multiple censorship mechanisms are not blocking the same websites with each mechanism. For instance, ACT uses only DNS censorship for blocking 233 websites, only HTTP censorship for 1873 websites, and both to block 1615 websites. Such irregularities are illustrated below.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/azWaVJW.png" alt="img">
</p><center>Censorship techniques used by (i) ACT, (ii) Airtel, and (iii) Jio for blocking websites. We notice the same ISP using multiple techniques for blocking different websites.</center>

<h3 id="somealarmingdiscoveries">Some alarming discoveries</h3>

<p>Our study has recorded large inconsistencies in website blocklists of different Indian ISPs. From our list of 4379 PBWs, we find that 4033 are being blocked by at least one ISP’s blocklist. In terms of absolute numbers, we notice that ACT blocks the maximum number of websites (3721). Compared to ACT, Airtel blocks roughly half the number of websites (1892).</p>

<p>Perhaps most surprisingly, we find that only 1115 websites out of the 4033 (just 27.64%) are blocked by all six ISPs. <b>Simply stated, we find conclusive proof that Internet users in India can have wildly different experiences of web censorship.</b></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XXaRpuf.png" alt="img"></p>

<p>Analysing inconsistencies in blocklists also makes it clear that ISPs in India are:</p>

<ol>  
<li>Not properly complying with website blocking (or subsequent unblocking orders), and/or </li>  
<li>Arbitrarily blocking websites without the backing of a legal order.</li>  
</ol>

<p>This has important legal ramifications: <b>India’s <a href="https://bit.ly/netneutralityframework" target="_blank">Net Neutrality regulations</a>, codified in the license agreements that ISPs enter with the Government of India, explicitly prohibit such behaviour</b>.</p>

<p>Our study also points to how the choice of technical methods used by ISPs to censor websites can decrease transparency about state-ordered censorship in India. While some ISPs were serving censorship notices, other ISPs made no such effort. For instance, Airtel responded to DNS queries for websites it wishes to block with <strong>NXDOMAIN</strong>. Jio used <strong>SNI-inspection</strong> to block websites, a choice which makes it <strong>technically impossible for them to serve censorship notices</strong>. Thus, the selection of certain technical methods by ISPs exacerbates the concerns created by the opaque legal process that allows the Government to censor websites.</p>

<h3 id="summingup">Summing up</h3>

<p>Web censorship is a curtailment of the right to freedom of expression guaranteed to all Indians. There is an urgent need to reevaluate the legal and technical mechanisms of web censorship in India to make sure the curtailment is transparent, and the actors accountable. </p>

<p>The whimsical attitude towards web censorship from both ISPs and the Government necessitates the development of a crowdsourced tool to <strong>monitor and measure such censorship from different vantage points in the country</strong>. This will shed further light into the geographical variation of censorship practices by ISPs across India, which is still unclear.</p>

<p>To probe this further we have ported our network tests into an android application, and are looking for volunteers who are willing to run it on their mobile networks. The entire process will be <strong>completely anonymous</strong>; we will not be collecting any user-specific information.

If that is the case, why aren't we all taking it? We hand out masks; why not Vitamin D?</p><p id="viewer-di3pq">Let's pause here for a reality check: Lots of diseases are correlated with Vitamin D deficiency – but most are not caused by it. It’s a correlation, not a causation. Vitamin D deficiency is often a marker of overall poor health; sicker individuals are more likely to develop low Vitamin D. Treating the deficiency treats the symptom, not the cause. In trials of Vitamin D vs. placebo for preventing disease, <a href="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-3-the-evidence" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Vitamin D often disappoints.</u></a> </p><p id="viewer-avjvo">But maybe Covid is different. Covid is a respiratory infection, and in meta-analyses severe Vitamin D deficiency does appear to increase the risk of respiratory infections. We also have a plausible mechanism through which Vitamin D could influence Covid. The latest hypothesis asserts that a “bradykinin storm” is largely responsible for the severe symptoms of Covid. A surge of bradykinin, a peptide related to inflammation, leads to blood vessel dilation and increased permeability (“leaky vessels”). This contributes to swelling and fluid retention in the lungs and numerous other effects throughout the body, including cognitive deficits, severe hypokalemia and resulting cardiac arrythmias, and hypotension.</p><p id="viewer-eg7lh">There are complicated pathways involved in the production and regulation of bradykinin. Covid involves the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which is involved in blood pressure control, fluid management, and inflammation. Vitamin D modulates this system somewhat, which is how it could play a role in modulating the inflammation and bradykinin storm that can occur with Covid. The relationship between Vitamin D and bradykinin is not simple or  straightforward, but it is there (find Vitamin D in the top left of the following image).</p><h3 id="viewer-a9vd1">Pathways involved in a bradykinin storm</h3><div id="viewer-6u3jj"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-and-covid?postId=5f729cf1efb0ee0017940a2e" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_7997c2251a1040b8be64237b3c6d8346~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_7997c2251a1040b8be64237b3c6d8346~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-f1rr2"><em>From: </em><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32633718/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><u>Garvin MR, Alvarez C, Miller JI, Prates ET, Walker AM, Amos BK, Mast AE, Justice A, Aronow B, Jacobson D.

People with low Vitamin D could be more susceptible to infection because they have other health issues. For example, nursing home residents are more likely to be deficient in Vitamin D – and they are also at high risk for Covid spread. The study did attempt to correct for some of this and still found an association between Vitamin D and Covid. Overall, this study provides a solid basis for future research, and reinforces the recommendation to correct Vitamin D deficiencies.</p><p id="viewer-d4961"><span><strong>2.

He has even received money from the tanning industry.

September 29, 2020 | http://ysflight.in.coocan.jp/FM/towns/bootloader/e.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://ysflight.in.coocan.jp/FM/towns/bootloader/e.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">





        
        
        <p>Let's say you have a almost-functioning FM TOWNS, but its internal 
		CD-ROM drive is dead, floppy-disk drive is dead, and CMOS battery is 
		gone.&nbsp; In that situation, all you could do was pretty much power it 
		up and watch boot-device cycles at the lower-right corner.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
        
        <p>I have already released a SCSI CD-ROM driver,
		<a href="http://ysflight.in.coocan.jp/FM/towns/internalCDROM/YSSCSICD_E.html">YSSCSICD.SYS</a>.&nbsp; This 
		driver let Towns OS think SCSI-connected CD-ROM drive is an internal 
		drive.&nbsp; However, it had some problems.&nbsp; First, you need to 
		make separate boot disks for Towns OS V1.1 and V2.1.&nbsp; Or, even if 
		your game title is not directly accessing CD-ROM I/O, some of those 
		titles use a special driver or BIOS, in which case you needed a separate 
		boot disk for your game title.</p>
        
        <p>  The second problem is<!--webbot bot="HTMLMarkup" startspan -->
<!--webbot bot="HTMLMarkup" endspan i-checksum="53585" -->

		it doesn't help your FM TOWNS if internal floppy-disk drive is dead as 
		well.&nbsp; In that situation, possible boot devices left were SCSI hard 
		drive, or IC memory card.&nbsp; However, to boot Towns OS from a SCSI 
		hard drive, you need to assign a drive letter, but to assign a drive 
		letter you need to boot Towns OS.&nbsp; It's a same old chicken and egg 
		problem.&nbsp; IC memory card that can be accessed from FM TOWNS 
		virtually doesn't exist any more.</p><p>  The third problem is since it 
relies on a floppy disk, it is impossible to manufacture using Windows 10.&nbsp; 
Well, you could with an earlier version of Windows 10, but not any more.&nbsp; 
If you are able to format a 1232KB floppy disk, you may be able to do something, 
but to do so you need TOWNS.&nbsp; Again, it's a salmon and ikura problem.</p><p>  
On the other hand, <a href="http://ysflight.in.coocan.jp/FM/towns/Tsugaru/e.html">my FM TOWNS Emulator "Tsugaru"</a> 
is now able to emulate SCSI CD-ROM drive.&nbsp; I am able to develop and debug 
an IPL (Initial Program Loader) and boot loader in Tsugaru.</p><p>  So I started FM 
TOWNS Rescue Boot Loader project.&nbsp; TOWNS reads and executes the IPL sector 
of a hard drive regardless of the drive-letter assignment.&nbsp; Therefore, 
theoretically it should be possible to write an IPL that loads IO.SYS from 
external SCSI CD-ROM drive, intercept before it hands off the control to 
MSDOS.SYS, install BIOS redirector, and continue the rest of the boot process.&nbsp; 
Then, TOWNS will think an external SCSI CD-ROM drive is the internal drive.&nbsp; 
Since it installs the BIOS redirector much earlier than CONFIG.SYS, it won't 
require separate disk for different versions of TownsOS.</p><h2>Updates</h2>
<h3>2020/09/29</h3>
<ul>
	<li>CD Boot Sector now supports both internal CD and SCSI CD drives.&nbsp; 
	You don't have to keep two separate discs for internal CD and SCSI CD.</li>
</ul>
<h3>  
2020/09/28</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added invitation to Demosplash 2020 in the Boot Loader message.&nbsp; 
	Please join us at Demosplash 2020 (and 2021, 2022, ...)&nbsp;
	<a href="http://www.demosplash.org/">http://www.demosplash.org</a> </li>
	<li>Release CD Boot Loader</li>
	<li>Release CD Boot Sector</li>
</ul>
<h3>2020/09/26</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Release FD Boot Loader</li>
</ul>
<h2>What You Need</h2>
<ul>
	<li>A almost-functioning FM TOWNS (of course)</li>
	<li>A SCSI CD-ROM drive (CD-R should work too)</li>
	<li>Cable for connecting FM TOWNS and SCSI CD drive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I don't think new SCSI CD drive exists any more, but still you can get 
one from eBay.&nbsp; Good luck!</p>
<h2>CD Boot Loader</h2>
<p>A ground-breaking discovery.&nbsp; FM TOWNS II MX and FM TOWNS II HR's system 
ROM read IPL sector from a SCSI CD drive and jump to IPL.&nbsp; TOWNS 2F didn't.&nbsp; 
My guess is TOWNS II CX and newer models models' system ROM reads IPL from SCSI 
CD drive.&nbsp; On the emulator I confirmed with MX ROM, and actual HR did the 
same.</p>
<p>Therefore, if I write an IPL, I can start a program from SCSI CD-ROM drive 
directly without relying on a floppy disk.</p>
<p>So I did it.&nbsp; How to use is extremely easy.&nbsp; Download the ISO image 
from the following URL and burn to a CD-R.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/captainys/FM/tree/master/TOWNS/IPL/DISKIMG">https://github.com/captainys/FM/tree/master/TOWNS/IPL/DISKIMG</a></p>
<p>Start your TOWNS II with this CD-R in the SCSI CD drive.&nbsp; You will be 
prompted to change the disc to the one you want to boot and press a button on 
game pad or mouse.&nbsp; If you follow the instruction, your app will start from 
the SCSI CD drive.</p>
<p>There are some limitations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Some CD drives spin up very slowly, in which case the drive may not be 
	ready before the boot-device cycle reaches the drive.&nbsp; But, it should 
	be recognized in the second cycle.&nbsp; It happens in my TOWNS HR.&nbsp; 
	Well, it happened in my HR, but for some reason it started waiting long time 
	for HD0 since this morning, and therefore it finds my boot loader in SCSI ID 
	3 in the first cycle.&nbsp; I don't know what changed this guy's mind.</li>
	<li>Due to the reason above, make sure to unplug other hard drives and keep 
	floppy-drive empty, or TOWNS will try to boot from whatever boot media found 
	first.&nbsp; (And may fail if CMOS is gone.)</li>
	<li>TOWNS' system ROM apparently only checks SCSI ID from 0 to 4.&nbsp; So, 
	make sure to configure your CD drive to one of four numbers.</li>
	<li>This CD image is confirmed with HR.&nbsp; MX system ROM also seems to be 
	able to recognize it.&nbsp; But, I can set up only one TOWNS at a time due 
	to space limitation.&nbsp; I haven't had chance to test with actual MX.&nbsp; 
	But, 2F ROM is confirmed NOT work.&nbsp; Probably this ISO image is good for 
	TOWNS II models, but not sure.&nbsp; I appreciate if you report successes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>CD Boot Sector</h2>
<p>Actually, you can make a Towns OS directly boot from the SCSI CD drive.&nbsp; 
It's extremely easy.&nbsp; Make an ISO image of the Towns OS disc (can be system 
software or any game), and overwrite the first 6KB with the following binary:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/captainys/FM/tree/master/TOWNS/IPL/BOOTSECT">
https://github.com/captainys/FM/tree/master/TOWNS/IPL/BOOTSECT</a></p>
<p>You can just open a .ISO file in a binary editor and overwrite first part 
with this boot sector.&nbsp; In CUE/BIN format, if the data track sector length 
is 2048, you can do the same for BIN file.&nbsp; If the sector length is not 
2048, there are gaps between sector data, and you need to skip those gaps.&nbsp; 
I don't know if there is such a tool.&nbsp; I might write one if there is a 
demand.</p>
<p>Due to some resource issues, I could confirm only Towns System Software 
V2.1L31 on my TOWNS II HR, but on the emulator, it seems to work with majority 
of Towns OS apps as long as it is not directly beating CD-ROM I/O.&nbsp; (Same 
limitation as YSSCSICD.SYS)&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Floppy-Disk Boot Loader</h2>
<p>Floppy-Disk Boot Loader does not solver the problem of floppy-disk 
dependency.&nbsp; However, it at least solves a problem: YSSCSICD.SYS approach 
needed separate disks for Towns OS V1.1 and V2.1.&nbsp; If you have a 
functioning FM TOWNS unit, maybe it's a good idea to make one for the doomsday 
when its CD/FD drives are gone.</p>
<p>In addition to "What You Need", you need at least one floppy disk.</p>
<p>I have confirmed the following image successfully starting Towns OS from 
external CD-ROM drive with FM Towns II MX and II HR.&nbsp; Download FDIMAGE.BIN 
or FDMINI.BIN and write to 1232KB-format floppy disk.</p>
<p>  
        <a href="https://github.com/captainys/FM/tree/master/TOWNS/IPL/DISKIMG">
		https://github.com/captainys/FM/tree/master/TOWNS/IPL/DISKIMG</a></p>
<p>  
        The boot loader uses first 160KB (I reserve 160KB just in case.&nbsp; It 
		is actually using much less.)&nbsp; You can write first 160KB using 
		FDMINI.BIN or entire disk with FDIMAGE.BIN.</p>
<p>  
        Now it is difficult to find a floppy disk without bad sectors.&nbsp; 
		Even in that case, you only need first 160KB.&nbsp; If you have a floppy 
		disk with a bad sector in the middle, you can still recycle it for 
		emergency-boot disk.&nbsp; This boot loader is environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>Once you have a disk, connect your SCSI-CD drive, put Towns OS V1.1 or V2.1 
system disk (or whatever game you have) in the SCSI-CD drive, insert the boot 
floppy disk in drive A or B, and power on.&nbsp; After a while, it boots from 
external SCSI-CD drive.</p>
<p>Well, it's getting more and more difficult to manufacture a 1232KB-format 
floppy disk.&nbsp; But, if you have a working TOWNS, you can format in Towns OS, 
and then use the following command-line tool to write a disk image.</p>
<p>  
        <a href="https://github.com/captainys/FM/tree/master/TOWNS/FDWRITE/EXE">
		https://github.com/captainys/FM/tree/master/TOWNS/FDWRITE/EXE</a></p>
<p>  
        You need to format your floppy disk in 1232KB format with Towns OS or 
		DOS.&nbsp; Then, go into Towns OS Command Mode, and type like:</p>
<p>RUN386 -nocrt FDWRITE.EXP A: FDMINI.BIN</p>
<p>It won't confirm before write.&nbsp; Be careful not to overwrite your 
important floppy disk.</p>
<p>You can see how it goes using my <a href="http://ysflight.in.coocan.jp/FM/towns/Tsugaru/e.html">FM TOWNS 
Emulator "Tsugaru"</a>.&nbsp; Tsugaru GUI is not supporting this, but from CUI, 
you can type like:</p>
<p>.\Tsugaru_CUI.exe ROM_MX -SCSICD5 
TownsOSV2.1L20.cue -FD0 FDIMAGE.BIN</p>
<p>to see how this boot loader starts from SCSI-CD drive.</p>
<h2>SCSI Hard Disk Boot Loader (Coming Soon)</h2>
<p>Let's say your TOWNS has bad floppy-disk drives.&nbsp; None of drive A nor B 
reads a disk.&nbsp; Or, it can be like your TOWNS has a dead CD drive and cannot 
start Towns OS.&nbsp; You don't have a spare TOWNS in working condition.&nbsp; 
And you upgraded your Windows 10 and you can no longer format a floppy disk in 
1232KB format.&nbsp; (Good job, Microsoft!)&nbsp; For those situations, I am 
working on SCSI Hard Disk Boot Loader.</p>
<p>Once CMOS battery depleted, you can no longer start Towns OS from a hard disk 
partition because CMOS retains drive-letter assignments.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the 
system ROM reads the IPL sector (the very first sector of the hard drive) and 
jumps to the IPL.&nbsp; Therefore, theoretically it is possible to start a 
program without relying on the drive letters.&nbsp; In fact, Linux can boot 
regardless of the drive-letter assignments in the CMOS.</p>
<p>Now you can find a virtual hard-disk device such as SCSI2CD.&nbsp; So, if I 
make a bootable hard-disk image, you can write it to the SD card, and start from 
there.&nbsp; I should be able to do the same as the Floppy-Disk Boot Loader 
using a virtual Hard Disk device.</p>
<p>I'm working on it.&nbsp; I'll release it as soon as it's ready and tested on 
actual TOWNS.</p>
<h2>Confirmed Titles</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Towns System Software V1.1 L10</li>
	<li>Towns System Software V2.1 L20</li>
	<li>Afterburner II</li>
	<li>Wing Commander</li>
	<li>New Zealand Story</li>
	<li>Splatter House</li>
	<li>Tatsujin Oh</li>
</ul>
<h2>Confirmed Not-Work Titles</h2>
<p>Basically those require a patch to run with YSSCSICD.SYS won't run with this 
boot loader.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Chase HQ (Need Patch)</li>
	<li>Raiden (Need Patch)</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Technical Information</h2>
<p>During the initial boot process, FM TOWNS' system ROM read the first sector 
of a media to B000:0000, and if the first four bytes are "IPL4", it jumps to 
B000:0004.&nbsp; …</p></div>

<h2>1. The SaaS Marketing Plan</h2>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://allfactors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/saas-marketing-plan-1024x682.png" alt="SaaS Marketing Plan allfactors" width="467" height="311" srcset="https://allfactors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/saas-marketing-plan-1024x682.png 1024w, https://allfactors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/saas-marketing-plan-300x200.png 300w, https://allfactors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/saas-marketing-plan-768x512.png 768w, https://allfactors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/saas-marketing-plan-600x400.png 600w, https://allfactors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/saas-marketing-plan.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px"></figure>
<h3>How to create a SaaS marketing strategy</h3>
<p>SaaS marketing is different from selling products in an e-commerce store. Different goals, different customer behavior, different key performance indicators (KPIs), and a different business type. </p>
<p>The good news is that there is a pattern about SaaS and you can create a marketing strategy for it. We’ll go over the patterns you should know and how to think about marketing for SaaS.</p>
<h3>How to assess strategy-business-fit</h3>
<p>In SaaS you can have product-led motion and pricing structure, and you can have sales led motion and pricing structure. Your strategy has to take into consideration what customer acquisition and pricing motion is right for you, so you can tailor your plan according to that.</p>
<p>We’ll talk in detail about the differences between the go-to-market motions, and how you should approach your marketing so you can plan for strategy-business-fit for your SaaS. </p>
<h3>How to determine who does what </h3>
<p>Once you’ve defined your SaaS marketing strategy, you need to divide and conquer. Allocating the right tasks to the right people and empowering the team with the right tools and knowledge is super important in order to achieve productivity.</p>
<p>We’ll discuss the best ways to break silos between teams and teammates so everyone can be empowered to achieve the collective goals.</p>
<h2>2. The SaaS Marketing Techniques</h2>
<figure><img src="https://allfactors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/saas-marketing-techniques-1024x685.png" alt="SaaS Marketing Techniques_allfactors" width="467" srcset="https://allfactors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/saas-marketing-techniques-1024x685.png 1024w, https://allfactors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/saas-marketing-techniques-300x201.png 300w, https://allfactors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/saas-marketing-techniques-768x514.png 768w, https://allfactors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/saas-marketing-techniques-600x401.png 600w, https://allfactors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/saas-marketing-techniques.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<h3>The techniques that actually work in SaaS</h3>
<p>Online marketing has many techniques, we’ll talk about how to choose the right techniques for SaaS marketing specifically. From SEO to content marketing, to social media platforms and which ones make the most sense. To advertising and what you need to know about running ads for SaaS products.</p>
<p>There are lots of nuances in marketing techniques. It can take a lot of time to figure out what works for SaaS marketing, we’re here to save you time and share all the best practices. </p>
<h3>How to turn techniques into measurable tasks</h3>
<p>There is a popular quote in management that applies to marketing “you can’t manage what you can’t measure.” – Peter Drucker</p>

<h3>What metrics you should pay attention to</h3>
<p>To drive growth and move the needle forward we need to pay attention to specific metrics, and ignore other metrics because they can be a distraction or just vanity.</p>
<p>We’ll discuss how to recognize which metrics are the most important for driving growth and which metrics are vanity for SaaS marketing. </p>
<h3>What it takes to consistently move the needle</h3>
<p>The thing about growth is that depending on the SaaS marketing technique, at some point the growth slows down. Especially when it comes to driving growth through ads, when you stop the ads, does the growth stop?</p>
<p>We’ll cover how to make sure that growth doesn’t stop even if one of your techniques stops working or if you run out of budget for ads.</p>
<h3>How to automate and do more of what works</h3>
<p>You can save a lot of time by putting certain SaaS marketing activities on autopilot by using marketing tools. From email marketing automation, to SEO, to advertising. </p>
<p>We’ll look at ways to automate those marketing activities, so they can be ‘working for you while you sleep’. </p>
<h3>Case studies of other SaaS companies doing marketing well</h3>
<p>A great way to learn how to do SaaS marketing and take action is by getting inspired with other SaaS companies who’ve done it well using best practices.</p>
<p>We’ll look at SaaS marketing case studies of companies who are role models for certain strategies executed very well. We’ll go over the execution step by step and explain how they did things, our hypothesis for why it worked, and how it can work for you.</p>

September 29, 2020 | https://www.camilleroux.com/2020/09/29/irritable-bowel-syndrom-medical-journey-full-of-pitfalls-but-with-a-positive-outcome/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.camilleroux.com/2020/09/29/irritable-bowel-syndrom-medical-journey-full-of-pitfalls-but-with-a-positive-outcome/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>I was diagnosed over a year ago with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Irritable Bowel Syndrom</a> (also called functional colopathy, IBS, Irritable Colon Syndrom or ICS for those in the know). For about 6 months, I was continuously sick.</p>
<p>I will tell you the story of my chaotic (and sadly common) medical journey with this disease, which strikes about 10% of the world population (<a href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(02)00481-X/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">source</a>). I’m also going to tell you about its important negative and positive impacts on my life.</p>
<p>Today, I’m much better. After meeting many doctors and specialists, I have finally found the personalized diet which allows me not to be sick anymore. It was mainly thanks to the help of a dieticien and by reading many articles. I also spent a lot of time finding the links between my episodes and my meals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a long time; I was reluctant to openly talk about my disease because I was afraid it could harm me one day. But after a <a href="https://twitter.com/CamilleRoux/status/1138066899110105088" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a> on Twitter, a lot of comments encouraged me to do so and convinced me it was useful. The lack of information and support by doctors seems unfortunately very common. </p>
<p>I wrote this article in order to:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<ul><li>Encourage and maybe give some ideas to people with the same disease</li><li>Show doctors that some existing diets works. It’s not inevitably about stress. It was useless to recommend alternative medicines to me.</li><li>Show the medical field that, like many patients, I have wasted a lot of time because of the lack of information and doctor’s support.</li><li>Add a witness for the press, patient associations and doctors and show them the urgency for doctors to get training, for the food industry and restaurants to adjust and ease the life of low-FODMAP diet patients, to show the importance of getting sure, true and updated information in French on the web.</li><li>Help to talk openly about intestinal diseases. </li><li>Thank my entourage who support me and adapt to my constraints.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<h2>Act 1: Symptoms Emergence&nbsp;</h2>
<p>All seemed to begin on May 12th, 2018. It was about 7 p.m., I was having a cocktail dinner at home with some common foods: some French cheese (Comté, Ossau-Iraty), hummus, bread and beer. Around the end of the evening, I began to feel nauseous and to get abdominal pain.<br>The next day when I woke up, I felt more nauseous. I was not hungry at all. I forced myself to eat a little bit of white rice at lunch and, at the end of the afternoon, all got right back and I could normally eat again. </p>
<p>Everything was fine in my life. My job was going well and I was going on vacation in the next few days. Nothing was a source of stress for me. </p>
<p>May 15th: For lunch I was preparing a salad, again with some common products: lettuce, tomato, pepper, beetroot, seeds, cereal mix and dried vegetables. At the end of the afternoon, I got nausea and abdominal pain again that lasted all evening. The next morning, my health got back to normal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the same thing happened on may 18th and 24th… After each episode, I naively tried to change my diet based on what I read online. I tried to eat less acidic, less fat, to follow a diet advised by a gastroenterologist but nothing got better. </p>
<p>At the first episode, I guessed it could be due to a virus, a gastroenteritis, or food poisoning… But with time it looked like nothing I had ever known.&nbsp;As soon as I came back home from vacation, I decided to see my general practitioner (GP).</p>
<p>I took the habit of writing everything I ate, my symptoms, and my episodes. That allowed me to easily explain the situation to my GP and check any link with food. You’re going to understand its usefullness!</p>
<h3>Description of my usual episode</h3>
<p>All attacks looked alike. Intensity and duration could vary, but it usually started with nausea (that gradually appeared in about 1-2 hours), then tiredness. Nausea lasted for some hours. I rarely skipped more than one meal. Most of the time, I postponed my meal for few hours. It could be along with variable intense abdominal pain and bloating. </p>
<p>Then, usually, I got some intestinal disorders and abdominal pain for few days. Then everything got slowly better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I rarely got back to a normal state. Usually, a new episode appeared before the previous one completely disappeared.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Act 2: The first disapointment</h2>

<p>At the end of May, I went to my GP. I showed her my diet diary, but all seemed right to her. She supposed it was a acidic stomach disorder and prescribed, for few weeks, a treatment with an impressive name: a proton pump inhibitor drug called Lansoprazole in French.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don’t remember this period very well, but I think I didn’t get any episode until the beginning of July. I thought the drug was working at first but, unfortunately, the episodes reappeared at the beginning of July while I was taking this treatment for a month. </p>
<p>Episodes were linked and overlapped.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Act 3: Failed attempts of GP</h2>
<p>It was summerime, either my GP or me went on vacation alternatively. So, I consulted different GPs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mid-July, I was on vacation in the Pyrenees. I decided to consult a local GP because I’ve been in pain&nbsp; for one week and the long treatment prescribed by my GP wasn’t working at all.&nbsp;<br>I explained the regular episodes I got since the last 2 months. This GP prescribed me a wormer treatment (Fluvermal in French) and charcoal against bloating.<br>No effect at all. </p>
<p>The impact on my life was quite important. I often felt pain and regularly tired. As attacks could happen in a matter of minutes/hours, I often cancelled my outings with my entourage. <br>I finally decided not to plan anything ahead. I dropped&nbsp; all my summer projects. I saw my entourage less and less. This disease started to isolate me. <br>I got more and more episodes and they were linking up. I rarely spent a day without symptoms. </p>
<p>Back from my vacation, I got a new episode. I consulted my GP and she prescribed a treatment against gastric reflux (SODIUM ALGINATE/SODIUM BICARBONATE) and a yeast (Saccharomyces boulardii) in order to go over my intestinal disorders and restore my intestinal flora.<br>No effect at all.</p>
<p>At the end of July, I consulted GP emergency because I was getting an attack during the weekend. It was more painful than usual and my GP was on vacation. For this GP, nothing was alarming and he prescribed me Spasfon and a blood test (which results were normal).&nbsp;<br>Spasfon had no effect. </p>
<p>Consulting different GP was exhausting. Each time I had to explain my situation again, show my diary, detail what the previous GPs ever did.&nbsp;<br>Many of them only focused on stress factor. I often had to argue that stress was not what made me sick. Some of them even argue that I could have been stressed unconsciously.&nbsp;<br>Regularly, they stepped out of their expertise fields by suggesting some alternative medicines: naturopathy, homeopathy, acupuncture… which I categorically refused. </p>
<p>At the beginning of August, after a few days of serenity, a new crisis came. I went again to see my GP who was back from her vacations at least. <br>She took things seriously and sent me for an echography. Results: normal.<br>I also went for a stool analysis. Results: normal.<br>Then, she sent me for a last test for <em>Helicobacter Pylori Infection</em> and said that she would send my to consult a gastroenterologist if the result was negative. <br>One week later, the resultats came back, negative.</p>
<p>I went back to my GP and she gave me a letter to consult a specialist. At that time, I was pretty confident, about a possible solution. I was impatient to meet the specialist in order to finally find why I was so sick.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I made my first phone call but they proposed an appointment several months later. </p>
<p>While my disease was ruining my life, preventing me from working and getting a social life, doctors all agreed that there was no emergency. I just had to take my pain patiently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spotted a practice that proposed an appointment at the end of September. This was by far the best date. I have a long month to wait…<br>I asked them if they sometimes had some cancellations. They answered me positively and advised me to call when I want to check if they had any cancellation. I called them twice a day… until I got an appointment on September 5th.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Act 4: The reserved diagnosis of the gastroenterologist</h2>
<p>September 5th: I was happy to finally explain my situation to a specialist.<br>But I was quickly disillusioned. The consultation was cold and fast (15 minutes). The gastroenterologist didn’t know if the problem was due to the stomach or the intestine. So she decided to prescribe a treatment for both. I left her with very few additional information and a 3 months renewable prescription:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul><li>Aflorex (one month): food supplement used to balance the intestinal microbiota</li></ul>
<ul><li>Bedelix: digestive clay dressing</li></ul>
<ul><li>Meteospasmyl: antispasmodic and a silicone dressing</li></ul>
<ul><li>Imodium: antidiarrheal</li></ul>
<ul><li>Trimebutine: regulates intestine motricity</li></ul>
<p>At the end of the appointment, I asked her if she knew what I had. She told me it could be a stomach inflammation, functional colopathy… (the list went on)</p>
<p>The functional colopathy was one of the most probable hypothesis according to her. If so, she told me that the treatment should help me and that, anyway, she wouldn’t be able to do much better.</p>
<h3>Some astonishing food recommendations</h3>
<p>She also gave me dietary advices to regulate my transit and therefore reduce my pain and my episodes:</p>
<p><em>– 2 fresh kiwis on mornings, preferably on an empty belly<br>– Pineapple juice <br>– Non-whole grains at breakfast <br>– Mineral water (brand HEPAR) up to 1 liter a day <br>– Oil RESTRICAL to spice hot meals (do not cook) <br>– Spinach <br>– Oleaginous dry fruits (nuts, hazelnuts, almonds, …) <br>– Cooked prunes on the evening (3 to 4 with cooking juice) <br>– AXAROLA, one pill an evening <br>– FRUITS AND FIBERS, one pill an evening</em></p>
<p>This came from a very good intention, except that with a suspicion of functional colopathy, it was absurd (in my opinion) for several reasons<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>I’m going to explain my point of view later below, but when you have a colopathy, it is often beneficial to remove (or at least diminish) FODMAPs from your diet. The efficiency looks obvious: a study showed that a low-FODMAP diet had a beneficial effect on 86% of …</p></section></div>

        <blockquote><p>The problems you encounter with user acceptance testing aren’t technical. They’re all political. You can’t solve all of the messes when things go wrong – but you can do quite a bit to prevent them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Users are required to have intimate involvement with application development at only two points in a project: at the beginning, and at the very end. At the beginning of the project, the user has to explain what he wants the software to do, so that requirements can be created – whether that specification is as simple as, “I need a utility to back up these files” or a requirements document as long as some novels.</p>
<p>Agile methodologies encourage user participation throughout the development process, which can improve the likelihood of a positive result. Be that as it may, the other point where an end user <em>must</em> get involved is at the end of the project: <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/understanding-user-acceptance-testing-for-better-results/">user acceptance testing</a> (UAT). That project phase has a lot of names, though my own working definition is “the last phase of the testing cycle, right before the team goes out for a celebratory beer.”</p>
<p>Only a few challenges in “acceptable” acceptance testing are about the tests. The transition from “bits of code that might work” to an application ready to go into production is more political than technical. The Acceptance Testing phase is the last opportunity for someone outside the QA or development team to stick a thumb in the pie. You know whom I’m talking about: the people for whom the word “deadline” doesn’t seem to apply (“I know I was supposed to identify problems last month, but gosh this is really important”); political shenanigans when management wants to take credit or cover their butts; consulting clients who are determined to find problems to avoid paying a time-based delivery bonus.</p>
<p>As a result, the celebratory beer is short lived if users respond, “This is wrong, and that is not right, and I really wanted this over here, and oh, by the way, we decided that we really didn’t need this functionality after all, so could you take it out?”</p>
<p>Good beer should never be wasted, so let’s see what we can do about this issue. (Note that I collected this input years ago, so I filed off my QA contacts’ names. However, none of their advice has changed.)</p>
<h3>Set expectations</h3>
<p>I seem to have a bullet point about correctly setting expectations in <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/5-rules-for-successful-test-automation/">every article I write</a>, but it’s become obvious how much it matters for <em>every</em> QA endeavor. None more importantly, however, than in defining up front what the user considers acceptable. That’s simply <em>got</em> to happen at the beginning of the project – or, failing that, at some point before you drop the completed application in their laps.</p>
<p>When developers create a requirements document, they think primarily about establishing what the application needs to do, and what it must accomplish before the software goes to production. However, defining the acceptance criteria early – as part of the requirements process – both helps you find hidden, unspoken requirements, and shows users what this testing stuff is all about.</p>
<p>As consultant David says, “End users discover something they don’t like – whether it is a real problem or not, whether it is per spec or not. Then they promptly declare the entire product rubbish based on that single point observation. They have no accountability, but seemingly magical authority to send the entire project back to the drawing board, and at the very last stage of the game.”</p>
<p>“An acceptance test is a type of contract between the users (or their representatives) and the producers, saying in essence ‘If you can do <em>this</em>, then the product is acceptable,'” says a tester named Joe. “But as professional QA testers can attest, it’s never quite that simple.” All sorts of unstated assumptions are left out of the Acceptance Criteria, and can become the subject of negotiation near the end of the development cycle. Those can turn into political shenanigans, development bashing, or delaying tactics, if not handled well.</p>
<h3>Put someone In charge</h3>
<p>While it won’t necessarily solve all the problems – I don’t think anything will – some QA professionals find that you can discover or prevent difficulties by creating a UAT team (even if that’s only one person) to deal with the users. That person works closely with the customer, holds their hand, guides them, and cajoles them throughout the project to do what they need to do. That individual should be experienced, able to build relationships, and well respected. (A heart that’s pure and the strength of ten would not go amiss, either.)</p>
<p>It’s also important for the liaison to <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/how-to-do-a-product-evaluation-for-enterprise-software/">deal with the right users</a>. The business users who define the functional specs may not be the people who use the system. One tester described a project that had to go back to the drawing board; this time, the functional requirements were created by people who actually used the system. Imagine that.</p>
<p>In other situations, as QA professional Christian points out, managers show up at the beginning of the project to approve milestones and budgets. The managers let actual users or their representatives define requirements and ensure that budgets and timetables are on track. But then, says Christian, the managers show up again at UAT time because the project needs their go-ahead (such as to approve the use of people or machine resources). Suddenly, project management responsibilities are reshuffled. People who were previously uninvolved or had little to say if budgets were on track, are now confronted with the reality of the work and all the imperfections it holds. “<a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/how-to-recognize-the-warning-signs-of-a-project-crisis/">Here comes the political mess</a>,” Christian says.</p>
<h3>Will the dog eat it?</h3>
<p>Software developers, testers, and users can get so wrapped up in the process of creating an application that they lose sight of the effect of deploying it. Unfortunately, this may not become apparent until it’s time for user acceptance testing.</p>
<p>Fritz, a project management consulting, explains, “A damn good reason for acceptance testing that is to make sure the new functionality will actually enhance, not hinder, business operations. Until a workable product is demonstrated for evaluation, the users may find it hard to understand the ins-and-outs of how their operation will change once the software is deployed, which makes UAT a major risk management effort.” In other words: Once the users discover how the new software affects their jobs, they realize they don’t want it after all.</p>
<p>Fritz sees this as a reason to adopt, if not the full Agile development set of methodologies, at least some of its underlying philosophy. The requirements-development-UAT cycle “demonstrates that the requirements are merely a starting point and the user feedback is essential to refine requirements prior to the next cycle,” he says.</p>
<p>Stephen, a consultant, concurs. “We deliver early, pre-production code, for demonstration and further definition. We go back to the shop to re-tool around the aspects found during the latest discovery session. This can be repeated – based on the scope of the project – several times.”</p>
<p>Whether you do this as an application prototype or as <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/lets-make-testing-agile-they-said-uh-what-did-they-mean-by-that/">an Agile development cycle</a>, developers and testers say that it make a huge difference. “This process puts 90% of the acceptance testing up front, and allows us a way to challenge scope creep once the&nbsp; requirements and prototype have been signed off on,” says Scott, an independent software vendor.</p>
<p>In the end, the question comes down to creating an application that adds value to the user. And that’s exactly what makes UAT so messy. “The number one problem with UAT testing is that it is political. Some of the things the user may not like, or that negatively impact their workflow, are not actual functional errors. Therefore, the system may have passed every test run with flying colors and is still ‘wrong,’ says Linda a QA manager. “Overall, it doesn’t matter if you produce a perfectly-balanced, perfectly priced, perfectly packaged dog food if the dog won’t eat it.”</p>
<blockquote><p>One candidate to serve as a end-user liaison might be a <a href="https://www.functionize.com/project/why-your-enterprise-needs-a-cqo-chief-quality-officer/">Chief Quality Officer</a>. Have you considered hiring someone for that role?</p></blockquote>

            <div>
              <p>I have a project idea that could involve doing some scraping of YouTube videos, so I started poking
around the HTML output of curling YT links. These things are a site (sp) to behold. If you curl the following
well-known URL and store it in a file:</p>
<p><code>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</code></p>
<p>Just searching for the title yields 14 results, spread throughout random HTML and JS. But it's only actually
displayed to the user once on the page, and probably again in the browser tab. It's not just the title
either, there's a ton of duplicated data and bloat throughout the file. I'm guessing it compresses well. I
checked a few other files and they all had between 10 and 18 copies of the title.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what conclusions to draw from this. A lot of them are obviously intended to be
machine-readable for things like <a href="https://ogp.me/">ogp</a>, but do you really need 14 identical copies?</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Since this errant observation somehow made it to the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24631698">Hacker News front page</a>, and eventually got flagged, I have a few more thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sorry the title ended up more clickbatey than intended. It's not making 14 extra HTTP requests just for the title. It originally started with "An HTTP request" but it was a few characters too long for HN, and I didn't spend much time rethinking it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I agree the extra text isn't a problem (like I said, that'll compress well). I'm more concerned about the underlying complexity it signals. There is more obvious evidence of this complexity (it makes 70 network requests when you load the page even if you pause the video immediately), this is just a novel one for me.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I appreciate the copies which are intended to interoperate with other systems like Twitter and OGP.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I actually appreciate the fact that a JSON blob of all the video metadata is embedded in the HTML. It'll make my scraping task much simpler.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We’re not building a generic notes app. We’re also not building an app for everyone. We are building a product that reduces the cognitive load for people with lots of meetings. Something that enables people with lots of context switching to ensure they don’t miss follow-ups. Something that makes relevant information immediately accessible. We care about being on point in our meetings. This means clearing away all the clutter and noise to help us be prepared and focused.</p>


<p>The idea for Witful started when I was managing a large team of people. I believe one-on-one meetings are a crucial part of being an effective manager, and I take lots of notes in my one-on-ones. I like to track what is happening with my coworkers and reports because it allows me to better support them. As I was managing larger and larger teams across diverse products and projects, I noticed how difficult it was to keep this all organized and feel in touch with my teams.</p>


<p>When we started <a href="https://realkinetic.com/">Real Kinetic</a>, I focused on&nbsp;the administrative tasks of starting and running a consulting business in addition to being responsible for our business development and sales. I quickly realized that the same need existed in these roles. I was in several meetings with various attorneys and accountants each week. I was on calls with multiple clients and sales prospects daily. I was on calls with our team internally. <em>I was constantly switching contexts, jumping from one meeting to the next.</em></p>


<p>Then, in an effort to develop leads and grow our client base, I started developing relationships with investors and other networkers. This added a new level of complexity to my note organization because I wanted to associate notes from these calls with that person, but also with other clients. I tried every note-taking solution on the market and none met my needs.</p>


<p>After a lot of fruitless searching for the right solution, I began sketching mockups on my whiteboard. These sketches quickly evolved into code, resulting in a simple prototype that let me play with the idea. It was immediately obvious that it was something worth pursuing.</p>


<p>In early 2019, we decided to have Alex dedicate time to build out the prototype. He translated the rough prototype into a usable product by the end of August 2019. Mike, Tyler, Nick, and myself started using Witful in our day-to-day consulting work. The value of our idea was clear, and we started getting excited. I showed Witful to my wife who was responsible for project management and managing client relationships at a software development consulting group. In her role managing a large number of client and internal relationships, the value of the product was even more apparent. After a couple weeks of using it, she came home and told me, “I no longer stress missing follow-ups because they’re just there.”</p>


<p>We decided to invest in developing the product and hired Coury to accelerate development. Through the fall, Coury and I worked to build and deploy features that helped us, as actual users, do our <em>real jobs</em> more efficiently.&nbsp;</p>


<p>We have continued to both add and remove features as we iterate on the product. We are constantly finding that some features seem like clear and certain must-haves, but after they have been implemented everyone uses it for a day and then never again. We realized smart organization, intelligent layout, intuitive user experience, and search are far more important than one-off home run features.</p>


<p>What has been most exciting for me is seeing how seemingly minor additions, revisions, and touches have been the most impactful to the experience.</p>


<p>We’re real users of our product and we’re excited to share it with you. We are hopeful that Witful can improve your work and restore sanity to your day as it has for us. Our vision for Witful is to build the product that lets you be brilliant at what you do.</p>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This is a response to the Rust <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/09/03/Planning-2021-Roadmap.html">call for blogs 2021</a> and also a followup to <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/druid/2019/10/31/rust-2020.html">last year’s entry</a>. It will be entirely focused on GUI.</p>

<p>There is considerable interest in GUI toolkits for Rust. As one data point, it was the 6th highest rated challenge for adoption in the <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/04/17/Rust-survey-2019.html#rust-adoption---a-closer-look">2019 Rust survey</a>, just behind async I/O. There is also a fair amount of activity towards this goal, though as a community it still feels a bit unfocused. A characteristic sign is that a new GUI toolkit seems to pop up every couple of months or so.</p>

<p>I believe there is great potential for a high-quality GUI toolkit in Rust. At the same time, it’s an incredibly ambitious task. Subtasks within it, for example accelerated GPU drawing and text layout, are in and of themselves incredibly ambitious tasks. I wouldn’t consider a toolkit “ready” for production use until it supported accessibility, and as far as I know there is nothing in the Rust space even starting to work on this.</p>

<p>Yet, perhaps against my better judgment, I find myself devoting most of my time and energy towards building GUI in Rust. In this post I will set out my hopes but also frankly discuss the challenges.</p>

<h2 id="why-gui-in-rust">Why GUI in Rust?</h2>

<p>Simply put, I believe that the strengths of Rust translate well to writing GUI applications, and that the missing piece is the existence of a good toolkit. One strength is Rust’s wide “dynamic range” – the ability to describe application logic in high level terms while still being attentive to low level details. Another is <em>strong</em> cross-platform compatibility. The increasingly rich crate ecosystem is compelling in many domains. And don’t lose sight of the importance of safety. In traditional object-oriented GUI in C++ especially, object lifetimes can be complicated, and it’s not hard to cause crashes, especially on takeoffs and landings.</p>

<p>I do pay attention to the competitive space, and one thing I see is Electron being used more and more, because it solves real problems. But I also believe that the success of Electron creates a real opportunity for a higher performance, lighter weight alternative. And in general for the projects I see in other languages, I find myself <em>wanting</em> to compete against them.</p>

<h2 id="about-druid">About Druid</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/linebender/druid">Druid</a> toolkit has made impressive progress in the last year, but is still nowhere near stable or complete. If you are looking for a GUI toolkit to develop your application today, Druid is not it.</p>

<p>We are developing the font editor <a href="https://github.com/linebender/runebender">Runebender</a> as the primary motivating application, but, while a lot of pieces are in place, it is sadly not yet usable for day to day font creation work. One of my goals for the rest of the year is to start creating a font in it.</p>

<p>That said, I am very proud of the work that’s been done in the last year. To hit on some of the highlights, we’re just landing basic but capable <a href="https://www.cmyr.net/blog/piet-text-work.html">rich text layout</a>. The keyboard event is close to browser quality (based on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/keyboard-types">keyboard-types</a>). There is incremental painting based on damage regions. Multi-window support is solid, with support for controlling window placement and dynamic hi-dpi. There is tab-focusing between text boxes. All of these are hard problems. Even more so, I am pleased that a lot of the work came from people in the community.</p>

<h2 id="converging-a-vision">Converging a vision</h2>

<p>Imagine a thought experiment for a bit. Obviously Rust is promising for implementing async, but there isn’t a consensus on the best way to do it. Some people feel it should be done with callbacks, and invest considerable effort into overcoming the serious problems with that approach. Others feel it should be done with a polling future trait, but there are multiple versions of that trait: some get the context from thread local storage, others pass it into the poll method. And of course some people feel the syntax should be <code>future.await</code> while others insist on <code>await!(future)</code>. Every couple of months somebody pops up on /r/rust with a new crate that promises to solve “the async problem,” complete with a nice-looking echo server demo.</p>

<p>That’s about where we are today with GUI toolkits. In many ways, I think converging on a single vision in GUI is a harder problem than for async. For one, people have different things they want to do. I’m personally most interested in things that resemble document editors. Others want 3D or video content. In the future, there might be commercial interest in enterprise line-of-business apps or interfaces for medical devices. These all have quite different requirements in the best ways to express UI logic, and how to build them. Not to mention the endless opportunities to bikeshed.</p>

<p>I am not (yet) proposing Druid as the singular vision that the Rust community should converge on. I’m enjoying reading codebases and learning from other Rust GUI projects. In particular, I’m finding lots to like about <a href="https://github.com/hecrj/iced">Iced</a>: it has good solutions to async, 3D graphics (through wgpu), being able to function in a guest window (important for VST plug-ins), among other problems. And I’m getting the sense that it’s easier for developers. The Elm-like reactive architecture maps nicely to Rust, and depending on exactly what you’re trying to do, it’s not hard to figure out how to express your app-specific logic. By contrast, Druid’s reactive model, while efficient and powerful in many ways, has complex concepts such as Haskell-like lenses, and places a burden on the developer to carefully design the “app data” to fit the Druid model. The <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/druid/2020/09/25/principled-reactive-ui.html">Crochet research prototype</a> is an active exploration into making that simpler. I am thankful to Iced (and other toolkits) for being a model to study.</p>

<p>The work to build consensus is complex and multifaceted, and it cannot be rushed. From my side, I hope to improve the designs and implementations to the point where they are compelling. I also hope to listen to criticisms, many of which are valid. I also think there is more work the community can be doing here. I’d love to see more active effort in trying to learn from the ongoing work and try to synthesize it. The GUI-related threads on /r/rust are sadly not a place where that happens; they most often consist of a statement of requirements (usually presented very informally), followed by a bit of bikeshedding. I don’t have a good answer for how to improve this situation, but put it out there as a problem I’m feeling.</p>

<p>While I think a converged vision is an admirable and ambitious goal, it may not be necessary for a successful GUI ecosystem in Rust. It’s possible that different types of GUI programs will simply require different infrastructure, so even in the long term it makes sense to have ecosystem diversity. Certainly that’s the case in the short and medium term as well, just to explore the space. And even without a grand unifying vision, there is lots of scope to work on infrastructural crates for important pieces of the GUI story, including text layout and related problems.</p>

<h2 id="learning-and-community">Learning and community</h2>

<p>Many Rust projects these days come with what’s basically a marketing pitch: “adopt this codebase, it’s awesome.” I am starting to see the Druid project in a somewhat different light. I consider its primary mission to be <em>teaching and learning</em> the knowledge required to build GUI. To that extent, the community we’re building, hosted on <a href="https://xi.zulipchat.com/">our Zulip instance,</a> is just as important as the code.</p>

<p>The knowledge needed to build GUI has many aspects, and is at all levels. Some of it is at a high level, like the best way to express reactive UI. Some of it is at a low level, like the keyboard event processing. A common thread is that a lot of it is very arcane, not really written down properly anywhere. Fortunately, a lot of it is accessible through reading the code of other open source projects, whether in Rust or in other languages (I’ve found both Chromium and Gecko to be especially useful).</p>

<p>So I consider this a goal, a success criterion, of the Druid project. If somebody wants to know how to solve a problem in GUI, the Druid codebase should be one of the best places to look for answers.</p>

<p>I love research more than most anything, and a lot of my own work has a strong research flavor. That has caused some confusion; some of the things I’m exploring are very speculative and will likely take years to come to fruition. Certainly my research into compute-centric GPU rendering is of that nature; I’m excited about the fact that it promises dramatic performance improvements over the current state of the art, but it’s nowhere near ready to put into production yet. I’m striving for clearer communication so people can have a better idea what is speculative, based on grand futuristic visions, and what is on track to being usable reasonably soon. But both are important aspects of what I consider to be the main mission: fostering learning about how to build GUI.</p>

<h2 id="baby-steps">Baby steps</h2>

<p>While I am driven by a long-term, ambitious vision, the goal of Druid in 2021 is not to deliver a general UI toolkit. Rather, we are deliberately continuing to follow a narrow scope. The primary goal remains the font editor project, and we plan to re-focus attention on that. I do think this is an attainable goal. I also think that what we learn from trying to build a real application with users will be extremely valuable to the more ambitious task.</p>

<p>One project management technique that is proving effective is “cycles.” Instead of trying to solve the most ambitious version of a problem, we choose up front what to push to a future cycle, reducing the scope for the current implementation cycle. An example is the choice to defer BiDi from our recent text work. This is obviously an essential feature for a real GUI toolkit, but we also know it could take weeks or months to get it right. To have any chance of shipping, we have to carefully budget our time and energy on subprojects that easily could expand to absorb our full attention.</p>

<p>A common development pattern for a fledgling GUI toolkit is to have a “hero app” that drives development. It really helps clarify requirements, and also makes it …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

Productiv is an enterprise </span><a href="http://productiv.com/"><span>SaaS management</span></a><span> platform. Our mission is to unlock productivity from your SaaS portfolio by giving you insights into how your employees are using their applications. Whether its collaboration, communications, project management, or any other SaaS application, Productiv serves as your central system of record for how these applications are used; licensing costs; and renewals.</span></p><p><span>Our focus on </span><a href="https://productiv.com/application-engagement-analytics-the-key-to-rethinking-saas-management/"><span>application engagement analytics</span></a><span>, combined with this centralized system puts us into an excellent place to extract trends across many enterprises for any number of applications. All of the data presented below is derived solely from Productiv’s platform, and aggregated across customer environments. This data in turn can help enterprises better understand how they are getting ROI out of the applications they invest time and money into.</span></p><h3><b>How to Measure Slack ROI</b></h3><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/19/slack-adds-7k-customers-in-7-weeks-amid-remote-work-boom-besting-its-preceding-2-quarters-results/"><span>Slack is booming</span></a><span>, as companies invest heavily in collaboration solutions that allow people to work more effectively, even as more people are working from home. But how do you know how much value youâ€™re getting out of a collaboration solution such as Slack?Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We looked at the common questions asked by CIOs:</span></p><ul><li><span>If we invest in Slack, how much will our employees actually use it?Â&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Does Slack improve collaboration between employees?Â&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>How do we measure the value of this collaboration to show Return on Investment?</span></li></ul><p><span>On a day-to-day basis, you might be able to measure messages across public and private channels. What does that really mean, though — are employees making the most of Slack?Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>To understand the value your organization is getting from a SaaS investment such as Slack, itâ€™s not enough to look at how many licenses you have provisioned. In fact, itâ€™s not enough to look at </span><a href="https://slack.com/blog/news/work-is-fueled-by-true-engagement"><span>daily average users</span></a><span> either – what you need to measure is </span><b>user engagement </b><span>to see if employees are truly getting value from their tools</span><b>.</b><span>Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>User engagement is how an individual interacts with a product or service.</span></p><p><span>Engagement looks at what features your employees use, how frequently they use it, and (critically) what kind of value they get from it — as value for employees translates into value for the business.</span></p><p><span>You can tell when employees are engaged with their collaboration tools and using it for deep work when they’re doing more with the platform than just using the basic features – for example in the case of messaging, lightweight private messages to other team members. Specifically, we break down value from thisÂ&nbsp; engagement into three metrics.</span></p><h3><b>An Analysis of The Three Metrics of Slack Engagement</b></h3><p>Many think of Slack simply as a chat platform. Our data however supports the idea that Slack has evolved into a collaboration platform, with three types of collaboration that we can measure. Let’s break down these three types of collaboration and examine the supporting data.</p><h4><span>1. Open Collaboration</span></h4><p>The idea ofÂ&nbsp;<a href="https://opensym.org/about-us/definition/">open collaboration</a>Â&nbsp;is employees freely working with other employees. Compared to rigid, hierarchical structures, open collaboration mixes things up. Anyone can join in. (Think company-wide brainstorming sessions, or town hall-style meetings.)</p><p>In Slack,Â&nbsp;<span>â€œopen collaborationâ€� can be measured by how users utilize public channels</span>.Â&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ragtag-notes/set-up-your-team-for-organizing-27563b0ab189">Public channels</a>Â&nbsp;are open to anyone in the workplace, with the exception of guests — theyâ€™re meant for company-wide announcements, updates, or general information sharing.</p><p>According to Productiv data,Â&nbsp;<span>those who use Slack are more than twice as likely to use public channels for messaging</span>Â&nbsp;than comparable messaging products.</p><p>Our analytics show thatÂ&nbsp;<span>74% of Slack users send messages through public channels</span>, compared to justÂ&nbsp;<span>34% of users for other enterprise collaboration platforms</span>. Slack isnâ€™t just a private chat platform — it drives open, public collaboration.</p><p>Anecdotally, we see Slack customers echo this philosophy. For example,Â&nbsp;<a href="https://slack.com/customer-stories/td-ameritrade">Neal Obermeyer at TD Ameritrade</a>Â&nbsp;noted, â€œ<a href="https://slack.com/features/channels/">Slack channels</a>, virtual spaces for sharing information and files, cut through information silos by making company knowledge available across the organization. By moving communication to public channels, we removed the subjectivity of sharing information so internal knowledge could scale as needed.â€� This type of approach is well reflected in our data.</p><h4><span>2. Cross-Team Collaboration</span></h4><p>Beyond open collaboration (conversations that anyone can join), cross-team collaboration means teams using Slack to work together. For example, someone from HR communicating to someone in Accounting, versus accounting only talking to accounting or HR only messaging HR.</p><p>On average, we found thatÂ&nbsp;<span>~80% of Slack users send cross-team messages</span>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://productiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-7.45.28-PM-1024x422.png" alt="" width="1024" height="422" srcset="https://productiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-7.45.28-PM-1024x422.png 1024w, https://productiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-7.45.28-PM-300x124.png 300w, https://productiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-7.45.28-PM-768x317.png 768w, https://productiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-28-at-7.45.28-PM.png 1377w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p><p><i>How a high-growth software company (1000+ employees) uses Slack between teams.

External Collaboration</span></h4><p><a href="https://innovationmanagement.se/2017/01/06/a-quick-guide-to-external-collaboration/">External collaboration</a>Â&nbsp;refers to how well employees work outside your company — say, with suppliers, consultants, or customers.

Definition-wise, Laplace transform takes a function of real variable $f(t)$ (defined for all $t \ge 0$) to a function of complex variable $F(s)$ as follows:</p>\[\mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} = \int_0^{\infty} f(t) e^{-st} \, dt = F(s) \]<h2><span id="Some_Preliminary_Examples"></span><a href="#toc">Some Preliminary Examples</a><span></span></h2><p>What fate awaits <strong>simple functions</strong> as they enter the Laplace transform?</p><p>Take the simplest function: the <strong>constant function</strong> $f(t)=1$. In this case, putting $1$ in the transform yields $1/s$, which means that we went from a constant to a variable-dependent function.</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OiNh2DswFt4?start=174" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>(Odd but not too worrying. After all, we’ve seen $1/x$ integrating to $\ln x$ in calculus. Not a constant-to-variable situation of course, but an unexpected transformation nonetheless.)</p><p>Let us take it up a notch, with the <strong>linear function</strong> $f(t) = t$. After the transformation, it is turned into $1/s^2$, which means that we went from $1 \to 1/s$ to $t \to 1/s^2$. A pattern begins to emerge.</p><p>Now what about $f(t)=t^n$? With this simple <strong>power function</strong>, we end up with: \[ \mathcal{L}\{ t^n \} = \frac{n!}{s^{n+1}}\] So there was a factorial in $\mathcal{L}\{t\}$ all along, hidden by the fact that $1! = 1$. What else is the transform hiding?</p><p>Here, a glance at a table of <strong><a aria-label="common Laplace transforms (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/pdf/Laplace_Table.pdf" target="_blank">common Laplace transforms</a></strong> would show that the emerging pattern cannot explain other functions easily. Things get weird, and the weirdness escalates quickly — which brings us back to the sine function.</p><h2><span id="Looking_Inside_the_Laplace_Transform_of_Sine"></span><a href="#toc">Looking Inside the Laplace Transform of Sine</a><span></span></h2><p>Let us unpack what happens to our sine function as we Laplace-transform it. We begin by noticing that a sine function can be expressed as a <strong>complex exponential</strong> — an indirect result of the celebrated <a href="https://mathvault.ca/euler-formula/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Euler’s formula</a>:\[e^{it} = \cos t + i \sin t\]In fact, a sine is often expressed in terms of exponentials for <strong>ease of calculation</strong>, so if we apply that to the function $f(t) = \sin (at)$, we would get: \[ \sin(at) = \frac{e^{iat}-e^{-iat}}{2i} \]Thus the <strong>Laplace transform</strong> of $\sin(at)$ then becomes:<br>\[ \mathcal{L}\{\sin(at)\} = \frac{1}{2i} \int\limits_0^{\infty} (e^{iat}-e^{-iat}) e^{-st} \, dt \]which means that we have a <strong>product of exponentials</strong>. Distributing the terms, we get:<br>\[ \mathcal{L}\{\sin(at)\} = \frac{1}{2i} \int\limits_0^{\infty} e^{iat-st}-e^{-iat-st} \, dt \]</p><p>Here, <strong>factoring</strong> the $t$ in the exponents yields:<br>\[ \mathcal{L}\{\sin(at)\} = \frac{1}{2i} \int\limits_0^{\infty} e^{(ia-s)t}-e^{(-ia-s)t} \, dt \]and since $\mathrm{Re}(s) \gt 0$ by assumption, we can proceed with the integration from $0$ to $\infty$ as usual:<br>\[ \mathcal{L}\{\sin(at)\} = \left.\frac{e^{(ia-s)t}}{2i (ia-s)}\right|_0^{\infty}-\left.\frac{e^{(-ia-s)t}}{2i (-ia-s)}\right|_0^{\infty} \]</p><p>Let us simplify further. <strong>Distributing</strong> the $i$ inside the parentheses, we get:<br>\[ \mathcal{L}\{\sin(at)\} = \left.\frac{e^{(ia-s)t}}{2(-a-is)}\right|_0^{\infty}-\left.\frac{e^{(-ia-s)t}}{2(a-is)}\right|_0^{\infty} \]By evaluating the $t$ at the <strong>boundaries</strong>, we get:<br>\[ \mathcal{L}\{\sin(at)\} = \left( \frac{e^{(ia-s) \cdot \infty}}{2(-a-is)}-\frac{e^{(ia-s) \cdot 0}}{2 (-a-is)}\right)-\left(\frac{e^{(-ia-s)\cdot\infty}}{2(a-is)}-\frac{e^{(-ia-s)\cdot 0}}{2(a-is)}\right) \]And because $\mathrm{Re}(s) &gt; 0$ by assumption, both $e^{(ia-s) \cdot \infty}$ and $e^{(-ia-s)\cdot\infty}$ oscillate to $0$ (i.e., <strong><a aria-label="vanish at infinity (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#vanish" target="_blank">vanish at infinity</a></strong>), after which we are then left with:\[ \mathcal{L}\{\sin(at)\} = \frac{1}{-2(-a-is)} + \frac{1}{2(a-is)} \]Once there, merging the <strong>fractions</strong> together would yield:\begin{align*} \mathcal{L}\{\sin(at)\} &amp; = \frac{2(a-is)-2(-a-is)}{-4 (a-is)(-a-is)} \\ &amp; = \frac{2a-2is + 2a+2is}{4 (a^2 + isa-isa + s^2)} \\ &amp; = \frac{4a}{4(a^2 + s^2)} \\ &amp; = \frac{a}{a^2 + s^2} \end{align*}which shows that after Laplace transform, a sine is turned into a more tractable <strong>geometric function</strong>. By following similar reasoning, the Laplace transform of cosine can be shown to be equal to the following expression as well: \[ \mathcal{L}\{\cos (at)\} = \frac{s}{a^2 + s^2} \qquad (\mathrm{Re}(s) &gt; 0) \] But then, one might argue “Why do we need to transform trigonometric functions like this when we can just <strong>integrate</strong> them?”</p><h2><span id="Diverging_Functions_What_the_Laplace_Transform_is_for"></span><a href="#toc">Diverging Functions: What the Laplace Transform is for</a><span></span></h2><p>What if we throw a wrench in there by introducing a <strong>diverging function</strong>, say, $f(t)=e^{at}$? As it turns out, the Laplace transform of the exponential $e^{at}$ is actually deceptively simple: \begin{align*} \mathcal{L}\{e^{at}\} &amp; = \int_0^{\infty} e^{at}e^{-st} \, dt \\ &amp; = \int_0^{\infty} e^{(a-s)t} \, dt \end{align*}Here, we see that so long as $\mathrm{Re}(s) \gt a$, we would get that: \begin{align*} \int_0^{\infty} e^{(a-s)t} \, dt &amp; = \left. \frac{e^{(a-s)t}}{a-s} \right|_0^{\infty} \\ &amp; = 0-\frac{1}{a-s}  \\ &amp; = \frac{1}{s-a} \end{align*} That is, as long as $\mathrm{Re}(s) &gt; a$, the Laplace transform of $e^{at}$ is a simple $1/(s-a)$. Here’s a <strong>video version</strong> of the derivation for the record.</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/33TYoybjqPg?start=50" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>On the other hand, if we mix the exponential $e^{at}$ with the <strong>power function</strong> $t^n$, we would then have: \[ \mathcal{L}\{t^n e^{at}\} = \int\limits_0^{\infty} t^n e^{at} e^{-st} \, dt \] which, after a bit of <a aria-label="recursion (opens in a new tab)" href="https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#recursion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recursion</a> and <a aria-label="integration by parts (opens in a new tab)" href="https://mathvault.ca/integration-overshooting-method/#Integration_By_Parts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">integration by parts</a>, would become:\[ \frac{n!}{(s-a)^{n+1}} \]Here, notice how the transforms of exponential and power function are both <strong>represented</strong> in the expression, with the factorial $n!$, the $1/(s-a)$ fraction, and the $n + 1$ exponent.</p><p>In fact, it turns out that we can integrate <em>any</em> function with the Laplace transform, as long as it does not <strong>diverge</strong> faster than the $e^{at}$ exponential. In the tables of Laplace transforms, you might have noticed the $\mathrm{Re}(s) \gt a$ condition. That is what the condition is alluding to.</p><h2><span id="A_Transform_of_Unfathomable_Power"></span><a href="#toc">A Transform of Unfathomable Power</a><span></span></h2><p>However, what we have seen is only the tip of the iceberg, since we can also use Laplace transform to transform the <strong>derivatives</strong> as well. In goes $f^{(n)}(t)$. Something happens. Then out goes:\[ s^n \mathcal{L}\{f(t)\}-\sum_{r=0}^{n-1} s^{n-1-r} f^{(r)}(0) \]For example, when $n=2$, we have that:\[ \mathcal{L}\{f^{\prime\prime}(t)\} = s^2 \mathcal{L}\{f(t)\}-sf(0)-f'(0) \]In addition to the derivatives, the $\mathcal{L}$ can also process some <strong>integrals</strong>: the integral sine, cosine and exponential, as well as the <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/probability-statistics-symbols/#Continuous_Probability_Distributions_and_Associated_Functions" target="_blank" aria-label="error function (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">error function</a> — to name a few.</p><p>But that’s not all. There is also the <strong><a aria-label="inverse Laplace transform (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/calculus-analysis-symbols/#Key_Transforms" target="_blank">inverse Laplace transform</a></strong>, which takes a frequency-domain function and renders a time-domain function.</p><p>In fact, performing the transform from time to frequency and back once introduces a factor of $1/2\pi$. Sometimes, you’ll see the whole fraction in front of the inverse function, while other times, the transform and its inverse share a factor of $1/\sqrt{2\pi}$.</p><p>This is as if the Kraken could restitute the boat intact — but only for a factor of $1/2\pi$.</p><p>The Laplace transform, even after all those years, never ceases to bring us awe with its power.

Are you kidding me?</p><p>If you don’t live in the tech world, Coinbase is a tech company that allows you to buy and sell cryptocurrency. The company does billions of dollars in revenue and may soon become publicly traded. Paul Graham is an investor and founder of arguably the most well known start-up accelerator in the world. Few people better embody the idea of “tech leaders” than these two.&nbsp;</p><p>Now I don’t know Brian or Paul, and for all I know they are good people. I appreciate the tone of Brian’s post and I genuinely think he’s trying to do what he believes is the right thing. But as I read his thoughts, I couldn’t help but think to myself…</p><p><em>“Well if this isn’t the walking embodiment of all that’s wrong with the United States right now, I’m not sure what is.”&nbsp;</em></p><p>This article isn’t meant to be an attack on Brian or Paul—far from it. But I am going to use their example to illustrate why they got this oh-so-wrong. And let me begin by saying I write this with no political agenda—I don’t identify with any political party—which leads me to the crux of my argument…</p></div></div><div data-block-type="31" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1601393386670_18556"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1601393386670_18620"><div><p>Brian likely wanted his post to communicate…</p><p><em>”We’re focused on our mission as a company, and aren’t going to be taking a political or social stance.”</em></p><p>Unfortunately all he effectively communicated was…</p><p><em>&nbsp;“We don’t care enough to speak up about basic human rights, decency, and ethics if it’s going to impact our company’s balance sheet.”</em></p><p>And no matter your politics, that’s a massive failure of leadership. That’s turning a blind eye.</p><h2>It’s OK to separate business and politics</h2><p>If you haven’t read Brian’s post, I think it can very fairly be summed up as follows:</p><p><em>Coinbase is a “mission driven” company. Building a company is damn hard, and taking sides politically or in terms of social activism isn’t part of that mission. We have employees with diverse views and don’t want to divide our own company by sharing perspectives that could distract the company from the mission that unites it.</em></p><p>On the surface, that may sound fine—I 100% understand and respect wanting to keep business and politics separate. I personally believe that’s any person’s or company’s right, as much as I wish more businesses would take a stand for what they believe in.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, not all businesses need to be altruistic. Fine by me. In all honestly I’ve spent the first 33 years of my life never once intentionally mixing business and politics. And up until this year I’ve always identified as “non-political.” But 2020 has made me realize how much <em>that description of myself</em> came from a position of great privilege. And as I said, the upcoming election in the US is about something so much fundamentally bigger than politics. If you’re truly a leader, you can’t just say “I’m not going there” to something as big as this.</p><h2>Why I’ve started to speak up as a “non-political” person</h2><p>At the subtle prompting of people like Rand Fishkin and Peter Caputa, I’ve started <a href="https://www.outseta.com/posts/leadership-hope-and-minimalism">to speak up</a>. My <a href="https://twitter.com/GeoffTRoberts/status/1307096268703969280">tonality and the topics of my tweets have changed</a>. And none of it has been to show support for any political party—it’s all been in recognition that this election is different.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1601393386670_21622"><div>

This election <em>is</em> about showing that we care about having leaders who lead by example.</p><p>At the heart of Brian and Paul’s comments are two devastating ideas:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>First, that building a company is hard enough as it is. So hard, that it’s not worth taking a stand on issues that could rock the boat financially.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Second, that in some way this is “leadership”—putting the financial interests of your company first and foremost.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>I fully recognize that we live in a capitalistic society, and I think that’s mostly a good thing. I want my own start-up to be a roaring financial success. But the perils of capitalism could not be illuminated more than by this interaction—we’re essentially saying “anything goes” because our most important obligations are to our financial constituents? We’re going to turn a blind eye to blatant and rampant ethical violations by the highest elected leader in our country because we need to improve outcomes for our financial stakeholders quarter over quarter?&nbsp;</p><p>I have a hard time calling that anything but having no soul.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Tech leaders, no one is asking you to take a political stance</h2><p>What’s altogether missing from this perspective is the very reason people are calling on leaders to take a stand right now. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="31" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1601393386670_33129"><div>

You’re being asked to take a stand on basic human decency and the type of behavior we expect from our leaders. If you’re not comfortable saying, “We expect the truth, we expect a leader who tries to unite us, we expect a leader who leads by example,” then you are unfit to be a leader yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>After all, we all work in technology, right? Isn’t the mission of the tech industry to better the human condition? To advance our abilities as a species? To create a better and more promising future for the next generation?</p><p>If you’re not comfortable denouncing the behaviors that Donald Trump has demonstrated over the past 4 years, you’re either complicit or cowardly. Cowardly? Fine. But true leaders don’t stay silent when the going gets tough. Complicit? OK. But at least be ready to openly admit it.</p><p>If you’re hiding behind being a “mission driven” company so you don’t have to stand up for basic human decency or hold our leaders accountable in any way, at least have fortitude to say, “I’m choosing to act in my company’s best financial interests over anything else.” If you come out and say that I’ll at least respect your honesty.

That’s true. But nobody said leadership at that scale was going to be easy. You’re the person charged with making the tough calls—have the spine to make one.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>👋 Hello, I’m&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/lennysan">Lenny</a> and welcome to a ✨ <strong>once-a-month-free-edition </strong>✨ of my newsletter. Each week I humbly tackle reader questions about product, growth, working with humans, and anything else that’s stressing you out at the office.</p><p>If you’re not a paid subscriber, here’s what you missed this month:</p><ol><li><p><a href="https://www.lennyrachitsky.com/p/getting-better-at-product-strategy">Getting better at product strategy</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.lennyrachitsky.com/p/fostering-a-culture-of-experimentation">Fostering a culture of experimentation</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.lennyrachitsky.com/p/when-to-hire-your-first-product-manager">When to hire your first product manager</a></p></li></ol><p><em>“When we hit PMF, we started feeling pull for the first time”</em></p><p><em>“Like getting pressed into the back of your seat by a fast car or a plane taking off”</em></p><p><em>“Word of mouth was uncontrollable”</em></p><p><em>“Why won't you take my money???”</em></p><p><em>“Yeah, you really can't miss it”</em></p><p>This is what you hear from successful founders when you ask them what product-market fit felt like. But is this always what it feels like? I wanted to find out.</p><p><strong>Over the past few months I reached out to founders of the twenty five most iconic companies I could get a hold of and asked them one question</strong>: </p><blockquote><p><em><strong>When did you first know you found product-market fit?</strong> Whatever that point means to you – was there something you noticed, felt, or experienced where you were like “Damn, I think we got something here!”</em></p></blockquote><p>After collecting and reviewing their stories (all of which you’ll find below), one thing became clear: every company <em>did</em> have a clear moment of PMF, and many <em>did</em>  experience a sudden hard-to-miss pull from the market, BUT many companies <em>did not</em>. For many companies PMF became clear over time through a series of compounding wins or milestones. Here’s how it broke down across the companies I looked at:</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddea5493-43b6-4017-93b5-47a3b37e38b6_1766x994.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddea5493-43b6-4017-93b5-47a3b37e38b6_1766x994.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ddea5493-43b6-4017-93b5-47a3b37e38b6_1766x994.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:820,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:390110,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><h4><strong>Some of my biggest takeaways from these stories:</strong></h4><p><strong>1. Market “pull” comes in many forms:</strong></p><ul><li><p>An inflection in organic growth</p></li><li><p>Customers asking to pay for the product before you ask</p></li><li><p>Users flip from being excited about what you <em>have</em> to mad about what you <em>don’t have</em></p></li><li><p>Customers complaining when your site goes down</p></li><li><p>People using the product even when it’s broken</p></li></ul><p><strong>2. About half of these companies found PMF immediately after launch, but half spent months or years iterating to get there</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Netflix: 18 months</p></li><li><p>Segment: 1.5 years</p></li><li><p>Airbnb: 2 years</p></li><li><p>PagerDuty: 2 years</p></li><li><p>Superhuman: 3 years</p></li><li><p>Amplitude: 4 years</p></li></ul><p>Once they got there though, it became obvious.</p><p><strong>3. The intensity of the pull is a factor of the </strong><em><strong>fit</strong></em><strong> (how good your product is at solving the user’s problem) AND </strong><em><strong>initial market size</strong></em><strong> (is it niche or broad)</strong>. Dropbox, Netflix, and Tinder were 10x better products within a huge market —&gt; sudden and broad pull. Instacart, Superhuman, and Substack were 10x better products but for a narrow set of initial customers —&gt; steady and compounding pull.</p><h4>What is Product-Market fit anyway?</h4><p>I covered this in <a href="https://www.lennyrachitsky.com/p/how-to-know-if-youve-got-productmarket">a previous post</a>, and I want to make clear that getting to a feeling of PMF does not mean you’ll automatically be able to build a successful business. There are three things you have to get right to find <strong>True Product-Market Fit</strong>:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Make a product that people want</strong> — that’s what this post is all about. </p></li><li><p><strong>Make a profit delivering this product to people at scale</strong> — companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/23/cherry-car-wash-shut-down/">Cherry</a>, <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2017/04/27/valet-startup-luxe-shuts-down-its-door-to-door.html">Luxe</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/10/rip-lazy-times/">Exec</a> are valuable cautionary tales.</p></li><li><p><strong>Find and keep these people, sustainably</strong> — <a href="https://www.lennyrachitsky.com/p/how-to-know-if-youve-got-productmarket">check out this previous post</a> that covers the quantitative side of PMF, like retention and sales yield.</p></li></ol><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8975379-7419-4366-b1f5-5f074a3a9c21_2400x1350.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8975379-7419-4366-b1f5-5f074a3a9c21_2400x1350.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d8975379-7419-4366-b1f5-5f074a3a9c21_2400x1350.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:140575,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><p>Of these three milestones though, the most likely to kill your business is the first: not building something people want. And that what this post focuses on — <strong>how do you know when you’ve built something people want</strong>? Below you’ll find stories from twenty-five companies — many of which have never been shared before — revealing the moment they realized they had something special.</p><p>Let’s dive in!</p><p><em>❤️ A HUGE thank you to these generous humans who helped make this post possible: Alex Solomon, Brianne Kimmel, Calvin French-Owen, Chris Best, Cliff Obrecht, Dan Hockenmaier, Drew Houston, Henry Ward, James Beshara, Jason Wang, Jeff Morris Jr., Jeffrey Queisser, Joe Gebbia, Jonathan Badeen, Katie Dill, Keenan Rice, Li Jin, Marc Randolph, Matthias Wagner, Max Mullen, Nikhil Basu Trivedi, Nina Achadjian, Olivier Pomel, Patrick Lightbody, Rahul Vohra, Ryan Graves, Ryan Hoover, Samuel Yam, Sarah Leary, Scott Gorlick, Tai Rattigan, Todd Goldberg, Tom Preston-Werner, and Tomer London ❤️</em></p><h2>Sign 1: 🔥 Sudden and significant pull from the market</h2><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F616f359c-2191-4289-a42d-80adf532482b_1474x412.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F616f359c-2191-4289-a42d-80adf532482b_1474x412.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/616f359c-2191-4289-a42d-80adf532482b_1474x412.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:407,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:218,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Dropbox for Business is Coming to Salesforce World Tour! - Salesforce  Australia &amp; NZ Blog&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt="Dropbox for Business is Coming to Salesforce World Tour! - Salesforce  Australia &amp; NZ Blog"></a></p><blockquote><p>“For me there was a visceral sense of your thing taking on a life of its own and lurching forward, <strong>like getting pressed into the back of your seat by a fast car or a plane taking off</strong>.

    <p>Discover the best music for focusing. Read the article to learn how to improve the efficiency of your work.</p>
    <h2>Content</h2>

        <li>What is concentration?</li>
        <li>Ways to improve focus and concentration</li>
        <li>What kind of music disrupts focusing</li>
        <li>Flow state music</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>What is Concentration?</h2>

    <p>There are several meanings of the word concentration. If we talk about focusing attention, then this is keeping the interest on one aspect while ignoring other things.</p>
    <p>In English language, this word came in the 1630s <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/concentrate?ref=etymonline_crossreference#etymonline_v_17305" target="_blank">from Italian</a> <i>concentrare</i>. Its origin is Latin: <i>com</i> ‘with, together’ + <i>centrum</i> ‘center’. This literally means ‘action of bringing to a central point’.</p>
    <p>Our ability to concentrate is important because the human body has limited resources. If we work being constantly distracted, then we will not be able to complete the task.</p>
    <p>Since ancient times, people have developed various techniques to stay focused. Let's dwell on the most popular methods.</p>

    <h2>Ways to Improve Focus and Concentration</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Choose the most productive working hours.</b> The early birds and late rasers have their peaks of activity at completely different times of the day. So, for the top-priority tasks, choose the time according to your individual characteristics.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Minimize the number of simultaneous tasks.</b> Scientists at <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/news/2009/august24/multitask-research-study-082409.html" target="_blank">Stanford University</a> have found that multitasking lowers human performance. Therefore, you should reduce the number of tasks and focus on one or two.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Make a clear plan and stick to it.</b> Until you complete one of the items, do not pay attention to anything else. Between plan items, you can take small breaks and change in the type of activity. If you are a computer worker, look out of the window or do a few push-ups.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Avoid checking your email and phone at work.</b> According to the
            <a href="http://www.fieldworksmarketing.co.uk/wellness/how-to-reduce-stress-for-international-stress-awareness-week/" target="_blank">International Journal of Information Management</a>, it takes us approximately 64 seconds to come back to the working process after checking email. If your job is not directly related to making calls and writing letters, put the phone away. Adopt a rule to check email and messengers before work and after work. Mute all notifications the rest of the time.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Use background music for concentration or white noise.</b> If you can't find a quiet place to work, you can use background sounds to drown out any distracting noises and keep your attention on the main thing.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, it happens that music does not help to focus. Let's find out why.</p>

    <h2>What Kind of Music Disrupts Focusing</h2>

    <p>Loud or fast-paced music. In general, any soundtrack that grabs your attention distracts you from your work. Dance music is created with the intention of fascinating you, creating a sense of celebration and encouraging you to dance.</p>
    <p>At the same time, if you put a song that you actively dislike, it will also not help your concentration, because you will think about your feelings.</p>
    <p>Songs with lyrics or commercials are also a bad choice for focusing. The brain will try to understand and process the text it hears.</p>

    <h2>Flow State Music</h2>
    <p>There is a particular type of music that is specifically designed to help you focus as much as possible. It calls flow state music.</p>
    <p>The term <i>flow state</i> was coined by the American psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi" target="_blank">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a>. He described this state as a maximum motivation and focusing on completing work. A person in the flow state feels freedom, joy and total satisfaction.</p>
    <p>Probably anyone who has been doing what they love has experienced the flow state. The Tinnire App offers an endless amount of music tracks that will help you stay in this state all day long. This AI-assisted music has been created specifically for concentrating. Visit

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Last week I was trying to add some <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/822/commits/aa833603a6b4c947c21da04aeac40d80444ebcc1#diff-b04459e37839cd223176618536295715R425">testing code to libsecp256k1</a> and I was pulling out my hair trying to get it to work.
No amount of <code>printf</code> was working to illuminate what I was doing wrong.
Finally, out of desperation, I thought I would do a quick check to see if there are any compiler bugs related to <code>memcmp</code>, and lo and behold, I found <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=95189">GCC bug #95189: memcmp being wrongly stripped like strcmp</a>.</p><p>Honestly this was a pretty horrifying bug to read about.
Under some circumstances GCC 9 and 10 will cause <code>memcmp</code> to return an incorrect value when one of the inputs is statically known array that contains <code>NULL</code> bytes.
As I rushed to <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/roconnor/2b8e22e829ed80088ed6690cc3c7f3a8/raw/455571a6d9053c597c1585debe6f9dbd6af85071/gistfile1.txt">recompile my computer system using GCC 8</a>, I contemplated the vast consequences of such a bug could be, and pondered how it was possible that computers could function at all.</p><p>However over the week, with the help of my colleagues, we managed to get a better understanding of the scope of the bug.
The bug can only convert non-zero values to zero values.
The static array needs to have a <code>NULL</code> byte within the first 4 bytes.
Most importantly, the <code>memcmp</code> result must not immediately be compared to <code>0</code> for equality or inequality, or any equivalent test.
A different code path is taken in the compiler in that case.
That explained why computers were still functioning.
I expect the vast majority of the uses of <code>memcmp</code> does an immediate test for equality with <code>0</code>.</p><p>I still wondered though, how much code was being affected. My colleague Tim suggested that it would be possible to instrument GCC to emit a message when it was about to miscompile a program.
Together we came up with <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=49276&amp;action=diff">a patch</a> to GCC 9 and 10 that would print a debugging message.
Once again, I recompiled my entire system, to see what GCC was miscompiling.
This is what I found:</p><ul>

</ul>
<p>On my entire system I only found 10 lines of code that were miscompiled.
Three lines are tests.
All of the lines could be rewritten as a comparison to 0.
None of the lines looked that serious.
I am not sure which one is the worse: the reduced message integrity code(?) from some ARCFOUR implementation or the something something from an ATM driver?</p><p>The mplayer miscompilation is the most mysterious.
The code surrounding that function all appears to be immediately compare <code>memcmp</code> with <code>0</code>.
And given that my debug message refused to point to exactly what line is being miscompiled in that function, I fear some set of optimizations has happened to allow this code to be miscompiled in some way.</p><p>With more hardware I could do <a href="https://hydra.nixos.org/jobset/nixpkgs/trunk#tabs-jobs">a more thorough investigation</a> of the consequences of this GCC bug.
Until then I am going to stick with GCC 8 until GCC 9 and 10 have a new point releases.

<p>As resources have been poured into the COVID-19 response, other infectious disease priorities have been displaced. Patrick Howie, CEO of a firm which aggregates useful clinical data/analysis, explains.</p>

<div><p><em>“The areas of research most negatively affected by COVID-19 include other infectious diseases, many types of cancer&nbsp;and neurological diseases. The impact is potentially dire in all categories, but in somewhat different ways.”&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;“Failing to make advances against infectious diseases could have&nbsp;a&nbsp;global impact in the future,&nbsp;given their ability to spread quickly&nbsp;and&nbsp;indiscriminately. Slowdowns in research here may severely limit our ability to counteract outbreaks of&nbsp;both&nbsp;known infectious diseases and novel ones, given the fact that learnings are often relevant across different vectors of disease.&nbsp;</p></em></p><p><em>“Unfortunately, the way our medical research system is structured means there are limited resources, and thus clear winners and losers in the face of crisis. Progress against COVID-19 comes at the expense of many other important diseases, with implications that could last years. A researcher&nbsp;diverting&nbsp;their focus to COVID-19 may have a difficult time regaining funding, employees and resources when the time comes. Patients who were candidates for a clinical trial that was delayed due to&nbsp;the pandemic may&nbsp;have pursued&nbsp;other options that&nbsp;could&nbsp;later disqualify&nbsp;them, or&nbsp;faced even more dire consequences of these delays. With clinical trials unable to proceed as normal, and recruitment and retention becoming problematic, the delays in new research may be far-reaching and long-lasting.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</em><br><em>“COVID-19 was an unprecedented challenge and call-to-arms for the global medical research community. The speed and size of the response has been stunning, serving as evidence of our ability to scale up global collaboration in record time, across borders and boundaries. The response stands as a&nbsp;monument to the work we&nbsp;can&nbsp;do together when necessary. This reality offers hope not only for future pandemics, but also points to possibilities for more purposeful and progressive collaboration in the thousands of other diseases that rely on continued research. Disease isn’t limited by geopolitical boundaries, and our response can’t be either.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;“COVID-19 has also put a new spotlight on the numerous issues in the healthcare system, including technological barriers like limited data interoperability. It’s become clear that no single&nbsp;person&nbsp;(or even group) can conduct research on the scale required for&nbsp;a&nbsp;challenge&nbsp;like&nbsp;COVID-19. To succeed, we desperately need to accelerate our ability to use tools like artificial intelligence and machine learning to amplify human effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></em><br><em>“COVID-19, like SARS and MERS before it,&nbsp;has&nbsp;naturally relied heavily on the talents of infectious disease specialists. In all cases, these experts had to divert their attention, time, energy and perhaps even funding, given that they were best equipped to tackle these new threats. What’s different about COVID-19 is the scale of the impact. COVID-19 has impacted the entire world in dramatic numbers, leaving no country unscathed. The scale of increase in coronavirus research, and the related scale of decrease in all other research, is novel.”&nbsp;</em></p></div>

          <p>Are Graph Databases the future?  Structured and unstructured data coming from multiple sources can have immense value if you can find the relationships within it, Graph databases consider the relationships between data as first class citizens.</p>

<p>Inter-connected data are the future, and probably the easiest way to model interconnected data is using a Graph Database.</p>

<p>In this tutorial will see two different way to model and query data using native graph database technology - TerminusDB and Neo4j.</p>

<p>if you have never used TerminusDB before, this article includes everything you need to get started with TerminusDB.
<a href="https://terminusdb.com/2020/01/14/my-first-terminusdb-graph-visualisation-bike-share-data/">My First TerminusDB Graph Visualisation — Bike Share Data</a>.</p>

<p>Now let’s see how TerminusDB handles tasks compared to Neo4j in practice.</p>

<h2 id="graph-database-main-concepts">Graph Database Main Concepts</h2>

<p>Graph databases  are databases that use graph structures to organize data: nodes, edges (relationship), and properties to represent and store data. The relationships allow data in the store to be linked together.</p>

<h4 id="neo4j-main-concepts">Neo4J Main Concepts</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Node</li>
  <li>Label (:Person)</li>
  <li>Relationship :KNOWS</li>
  <li>Property {name}</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/neo4j-graph-know.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In Neo4j the main components of the property graph model are nodes and relationships, in our example, <strong>Maria</strong>, <strong>Anna</strong>, <strong>Tom</strong> and <strong>Jim</strong> are our nodes and <strong>KNOWS</strong> is our relationship between nodes.</p>

<p>Nodes and Relationships can have properties, properties are name-value pairs that provide additional details for nodes and relationships. You can group similar nodes together by assigning a node label (:Person). A node can have zero to many labels.</p>

<h4 id="terminusdb">TerminusDB</h4>

<ul>
  <li>OrdinaryClass</li>
  <li>DocumentClass (doc:Person)</li>
  <li>ObjectProperty (knows:doc:Person)</li>
  <li>DatatypeProperty (name:String)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/terminusdb-graph-knows.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In TerminusDB everything is an object of a Class - objects can have properties and some of these properties may link to other objects. Document Classes are top-level classes, which allow the graph to be serialized into documents.  Our example <strong>Maria</strong>, <strong>Anna</strong>, <strong>Tom</strong>, and <strong>Jim</strong> are our Document Objects. The <strong>knows</strong> property is an ObjectProperty with range being the <strong>Person</strong> document.</p>

<p>Classes can be subclasses of other classes, which means that they inherit all the parent’s properties (much like inheritance in object-oriented programming). Multiple inheritance is supported.</p>

<p>The type of data that the property points to can either be a simple datatype literal (e.g. an integer or string) (DatatypeProperty) or it can be a class (ObjectProperty).</p>

<h2 id="query-language">Query language</h2>

<p>Neo4j uses <strong>Cypher</strong> to store and retrieve data from the graph database. Cypher is 
a graph query language and the best way to interact with Neo4j.</p>

<p>TerminusDB uses <a href="https://terminusdb.com/docs/woql"><strong>WOQL</strong> (Web Object Query Language)</a> which allows queries to be written in either javascript, python or as JSON-LD documents. All these examples are written using woql.js a javascript layer that allows queries to be written in simple javascript.</p>

<h2 id="schema">Schema</h2>

<p>A schema in Neo4j refers to indexes and constraints that can be applied to nodes. Neo4j is often described as schema optional, meaning that it is not necessary to create indexes and constraints. Index and Constraint can be added at any time.</p>

<p><em>In our example we create the constraint <strong>person_unique</strong>, it specifies that the properties <strong>name</strong> and <strong>born</strong> have to exist on all nodes with label <strong>Person</strong> and the combination of the property values is unique.</em></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>CONSTRAINT</span> <span>person_unique</span>
<span>ON</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span><span>:</span><span>Person</span><span>)</span> <span>ASSERT</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>.</span><span>born</span><span>)</span> <span>IS</span> <span>NODE</span> <span>KEY</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>TerminusDB is schema optional, but to take advantage of schema checking, it is better to create a schema before inserting data. TerminusDB lets you change your schema at any time. 
TerminusDB is a graph database that stores data like Git. <strong>TerminusDB allows for the whole suite of revision control features: branch, merge, squash, rollback, blame, and time-travel.</strong></p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using the WOQL.js api, we create the <strong>Person</strong> Document class. This object has 3 properties, with three different types. The data type range in <strong>knows</strong> property (ObjectProperty) is the <strong>Person</strong> document class. The cardinality 1 for <em>name</em> and <em>date_of_birth</em> specifies that both property values have a single value.</p>

<h2 id="insert-data">Insert Data</h2>

<p>Here is an example of Cypress syntax for inserting data</p>

<p>We add 4 nodes of type (label) <strong>Person</strong> and relationships <strong>KNOWS</strong> between the nodes.</p>

<p>Let’s see how we add documents and relationships with TerminusDB - queries are accessible in a very easy way with JavaScript using the woql.js layer.</p>

<p>We create <strong>Person</strong> documents and we link them using the <strong>“knows”</strong> property in <strong>Person</strong> document. Our relationships between documents have been created.</p>

<p>In our graph we now add another type of Person called Doctor, this entity has all the Person properties plus it is connected to the other nodes by the <strong>patient</strong> relationship</p>

<p>In Neo4j we can add multi labels to a node so our node is Person and Doctor at the same time.</p>

<p>In TerminusDB classes can be subclasses of other classes, so let’s add a subclass for <strong>scm:Person</strong> called <strong>scm:Doctor</strong>.</p>

<p>A Doctor shares all of the properties available to a Person, but it also has a <strong>patient</strong> (ObjectProperty).</p>

<h2 id="query-the-data">Query the Data</h2>

<p>Now, how we write our query for getting how the <strong>Person</strong> <strong>knows</strong> each others</p>

<p>Here an Cypher example</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>MATCH</span> <span>(</span><span>person</span><span>:</span><span>Person</span><span>)</span><span>-</span><span>[:</span><span>KNOWS</span><span>]</span><span>-</span><span>(</span><span>otherPerson</span><span>:</span><span>Person</span><span>)</span>
<span>RETURN</span> <span>person</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span><span>otherPerson</span><span>.</span><span>name</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s see the TerminusDB WOQL query using woql.js</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>or</span><span>(</span><span>triple</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>v:Person</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>knows</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>v:OtherPerson</span><span>'</span><span>),</span>

<p>How do we get only people who knows each other and are patients of the doctor <strong>Freud</strong> ?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>WebSockets are an outdated technology deemed dead thanks to the ietf not adding HTTP/2 support. Using Server Sent Events, we could simplify the implementation of GraphQL Subscriptions, reduce frontend code and increase performance as well as flexibility when writing modern frontend applications.</p><p>GraphQL subscriptions are a mechanism to stream updates from the GraphQL server to the GraphQL client. You can use subscriptions e.g to automatically update the UI once there's a new message available in a chat room. Here's an example Operation:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>subscription Chat </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  messages</span><span>(</span><span>room</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    message </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      id</span></p><p><span>      author</span></p><p><span>      text</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>In order to stream messages from the server to the client, there needs to be a persisted connection between the two. The most used transport for GraphQL Subscriptions is using WebSockets based on the <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraphQL over WebSockets Protocol</a> by Apollo.</p><p>I'd like to discuss various aspects of this approach and why I think we should deprecate it in favour of technology that is a much better fit, Server-Sent Events (SSE).</p><p>To initiate the protocol it's not enough to just open a WebSocket connection. The client needs to send a "connection init" message to which the server needs to respond with "ack". WebSockets operate over TCP so it's not obvious to me why you would need to ack receiving a message.</p><p>Once the initial message is acknowledged the client needs to send a GraphQL operation alongside the ID of the operation. Both the client and the server have to remember the ID of each individual Operation because all Operations/Subscriptions get multiplexed over a single WebSocket connection. This makes the implementation of both server and client overly complex. We will see how SSE will improve this because it takes care of the multiplexing for us.</p><p>If the client decides to unsubscribe a subscription it needs to send a "stop" message over the WebSocket connection. This gets once again acknowledged by the server sending a "done" message. Again, as this is still using TCP I'm not sure why this is required.</p><p>Multiplexing in terms of GraphQL means that multiple Subscriptions use the same connection. In case of the implementation over WebSockets multiplexing is implemented using Javascript. This code needs to be written and maintained. It needs to be transpiled and then must run in each and every browser. Ideally, we can remove as much code as possible to simplify development and keep the Javascript running in the browser as little as possible.</p><p>The Browser API to use Server-Sent Events is named EventSource. While WebSockets allow bidirectional communication, Server-Sent Events, as the name indicates only allow the server to stream events to the client and not in both directions. Luckily, we don't have to stream messages from the client to the server to implement GraphQL subscriptions. We simply open one EventSource for each Subscription. This simplifies both the client as well as the server implementation. There's no more custom code required to remember operations and their ID's to associate a message with the right Subscription. Multiplexing is done by the client &amp; server automatically.</p><p>The ietf decided to not add WebSocket support over HTTP/2. This means that for each WebSocket connection, the browser has to open a new TCP connection to the server because the initial Handshake is based on HTTP/1.1. Depending on the browser your users are using the number of allowed TCP connections per host varies between 2 and 8 averaging at around 5. Keep in mind that a user might open multiple tabs with the same website so you should try keeping open connections at a minimum.</p><p>With Server-Sent Events this is a different story. Server-Sent Events, when used with HTTP/2 multiplex automatically over a single TCP Connection. This means you can open more than 100 EventSources to the same host across multiple tabs and would still only use one single TCP connection.</p><p>These days, component-based single page applications get more and more popular. Frameworks like React, Vue, Flutter etc. all have some concept of Components that take data and render it.</p><p>Using a persisted WebSocket connection means we have to use dependency injection to make this connection available to all components.</p><p>With the EventSource API on the other hand we can simplify the code required to implement Subscriptions. Here's an example using React's Hooks API:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>const</span><span> </span><span>SubscriptionComponent</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>data</span><span>,</span><span>setData</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>const</span><span> source </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>EventSource</span><span>(</span><span>"https://example.com/persisted/FooSubscription"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        source</span><span>.</span><span>onmessage</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>e</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>            </span><span>setData</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>            source</span><span>.</span><span>close</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span>{</span><span>data</span><span>}</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>The implementation is rather simple. Once the component get's mounted we start the EventSource. New messages get pushed into setState() to trigger re-rendering the component. The <code>return () =&gt; </code> function at the end of useEffect can be used to clean up the EventSource to avoid memory leaks. No additional library is required to implement multiplexing.</p><p>What looks simple on the client is even simpler on the server. In comparison to WebSockets, Server-Sent Events can be implemented without any additional dependencies. Have a look at this <a href="https://gist.github.com/ismasan/3fb75381cd2deb6bfa9c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Example</a> written in Golang to see how simple the implementation is.</p><p>With all the positive aspects what might hold you back from adopting this?</p><h2>Internet Explorer</h2><p>First of all, the EventSource API is supported by 93.8% by all Browsers. The WebSocket API, on the other hand, is supported by 97.41%. That is because IE does not support the SSE API. Is this a blocker? No, but it contradicts with the idea of reducing complexity. If you want to support IE you have to add a polyfill for the missing API.</p><h2>HTTP/2</h2><p>The EventSource API makes a lot of sense when used together with HTTP/2 because only then you can multiplex all Subscriptions over a single TCP connection. So, if your server or clients don't support HTTP/2 you're in trouble. If you're not sure if your clients can use HTTP/2 you might want to stick with WebSockets.</p><h2>URL length limitations</h2><p>The non-polyfill Browser API to initiate an EventSource doesn't allow you to send a payload. That is, you have to send the Operation as well as the variables in the query string of the URL. Due to URL length limitations, you might not be able to send the Operation in its original format. This problem is best addressed using persisted queries. I've written another article on persisted queries if you want to get more details about the concept.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Server-Sent Events and the EventSource Browser API simplify both the client as well as the server implementation a lot. We can reduce the amount of code and are able to improve performance with HTTP/2 while reducing resource consumption because we're running less Javascript code.</p><p>At the same time, we're forced to use Persisted Queries and need to migrate from our WebSocket implementation to SSE, don't we? Not really, this is where WunderGraph comes into the picture.</p><p>We have done the migration already. WunderGraph takes your GraphQL Server with the WebSocket implementation and turns all Subscriptions into Server-Sent Events on the fly.</p><p>We also take care of persisting all GraphQL Operations for you and generate a client for any frontend framework you'd like to use.</p><p>This means you get all the benefits of SSE without any additional work to be done.</p><p>As a side effect your GraphQL server becomes a lot more secure because it's not directly exposed anymore to the public. It's hidden behind WunderGraph which only allows the persisted you previously registered.</p><h2>There's one more thing..</h2><p>Did you know that the Query Planner of WunderGraph allows you to join Subscriptions with other data sources?</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>subscription RocketStatus </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  rocketStatus </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    speed</span></p><p><span>    altitude</span></p><p><span>    aboveCountryCode</span></p><p><span>    country </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      name</span></p><p><span>      capital</span></p><p><span>      currency</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>This feature allows you to join any type of different data sources together with very little configuration.</p><p>For the future we're planning to add support for GraphQL Federation. This means you will be able to have Subscriptions and many more features for your federated GraphQL implementations thanks to the WunderGraph Query Planner and Execution Engine.</p><p>If you're interested in this functionality, leave your email in the chat so we can inform you once we have implemented it.</p></section></div>]]>

<p>Nick and Maria want to talk about sugar. Does it reduce lifespan? They disagree, but are honest and principled. They want to find the truth and agree on it.</p>

<p>How should they talk? Take turns? Try hard to be polite and respectful? Allow interruptions? Search for origins of disagreement? Areas of agreement? Make bets? Get a moderator?</p>

<p>Or maybe Nick and Maria want to talk about tax-exemption for churches. It might be hard to get consensus, since this is a matter of opinion. Still, they’d like to reduce their disagreement to different underlying values. What should they do? Repeat the other’s argument? Tell personal stories? Run ideological Turing tests?</p>

<p>Do conversations have known best practices? How much do they improve the odds of landing on the truth?</p>



<p>In East Africa 70,000 years ago, humans made their first steps towards language. This didn’t happen for <em>truth</em>, it happened to <em>increase reproductive fitness</em>. Overly open-minded people were probably easy to manipulate. Scrupulously honest people were probably bad at manipulating. Many false beliefs still <em>enhanced reproductive fitness</em> (typically by <a href="https://dynomight.home.blog/2020/05/27/sapiens-part-1-the-cognitive-revolution/">improving cooperation</a>).</p>

<p>So, one might argue, <em>of course</em> we are terrible at finding truth via conversation! Why are we surprised that our instincts are bad at something we never evolved to be good at?</p>



<p>Doing some research, Maria finds the work of Robert Cialdini, who says we are persuaded by reciprocity, scarcity, authority, consistency, liking, and consensus. But these don’t seems useful to Maria. They are mostly “dark patterns” of persuasion, that work for anything regardless of its truth.</p>

<p>Instead, are there “non-dark” patterns of persuasion, that work well <em>for true stuff</em> but not for false stuff?</p>



<p>Over a few months, Nick and Maria have a dozen of these conversations. The results are exactly what you’d expect: No one ever changes their mind about anything. Maria has a feeling she can’t be right about <em>everything</em>. But try as she might, she can’t find a case where Nick’s arguments convince her.</p>

<p>Eventually, she has a strange idea. Maybe she should fight fire with fire, cognitive-bias wise. She decides that in each discussion they should both <em>intentionally</em> subject themselves to as much dark-pattern manipulation as possible. Her theory is that there is an “energy barrier” that prevents them from getting into a mind-space where it’s even possible to appreciate the other position fairly.</p>

<p>By temporarily brainwashing themselves a little bit, can they can actually give the other position a fair chance?</p>



<p>It’s reasonable to be skeptical about the above ideas. Humans have been talking for 70,000 years. If there was a trick to talking better, wouldn’t we have found it already? I showed some of the above thoughts to a friend, who responded, “LOLOLOLOLOL, dynomight, you sweet wide-eyed gazelle. The rare Nicks and Marias of the world do great already. The problem is <em>dishonest</em>, <em>unprincipled</em> people.”</p>

<p>So perhaps better conversation can’t save the world. Still, I think a different type of discourse has much more room for improvement: That in <em>online forums</em>. It sounds hyperbolic, but I genuinely believe this could move the needle on the future of humanity.</p>

<p>Just think about it. The world is a complex place. Want to understand the effects of the minimum wage? The long-term trajectory of population growth? The effects of vitamin C? No one human brain can process all the relevant information for such questions. But shouldn’t <em>groups</em> of brains, if we could “network” them properly, have much greater capabilities?</p>



<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/discourse/conversational_graphs.png">
</p>

<p>Online forums have various design dimensions.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Conversational graphs.</strong> An old-school message board is a chronological list. Modern forums (Reddit, LessWrong) represent comments in a reply tree. On 4chan, a directed acyclic graph of replies is overlaid on the chronological list: Someone can reply to multiple messages, and pointers are provided at both ends to move around the graph that way. In Stack Overflow, <em>answers</em> are ordered by votes, but <em>comments on answers</em> are chronological.</li>
  <li><strong>Voting.</strong> Some don’t use it at all (old-school boards). Some order everything by votes (Reddit). Some use votes to order some levels but not others (Stack Overflow).</li>
  <li><strong>Who can put content where?</strong> On Twitter, anyone can throw their replies up on anyone else’s content. It would be a very different place if you could only do this if that person followed you.</li>
  <li><strong>Moderation.</strong> This varies from <em>Moderate to Crush the Human Spirit</em> (Stack Overflow) to <em>Moderate When Alternative is Prison</em> (4chan).</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s hard to understand the influence of most of these choices, since popular forums vary along many dimensions at the same time. Most forums today are optimized for the goal of “make forum owners rich.” We don’t know the decision-making process, or what tradeoffs would be made with different goals.</p>

<p>I don’t think it’s possible to sit around and figure out what effects a given forum design will have. Human beings and social behavior are too complex. We need to systematically test the different designs, and see what actually happens empirically. Is anyone doing that?</p>



<p>Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sometimes people have useful ideas, but give them in a long, boring, hard to read form. Can we allow users to edit each others’ content?</li>
  <li>“Flattening” comments into a linear order is always a distortion. Why not learn-in to the idea of a full conversational graph, with some kind of visualization that allows people to elegantly navigate it?</li>
  <li>Inside a conversation are many interesting sub-conversations. Can users create “curated views” to highlight the best comments in one sub-conversation?</li>
  <li>We <em>say</em> we want beauty and truth and to be better people. But we can’t resist cat videos and the latest political outrage. Can we allow users to “Ulysses nudge” themselves, by choosing the kind of content they <em>wish</em> they enjoyed? Let the algorithm find a way to try to manipulate the user into doing what the user’s “better self” wants.</li>
  <li>Forums are great ways to share knowledge. Prediction markets are also a great way to combine knowledge. Can we find an effective way to combine the two?</li>
</ul>

<p>These ideas are all probably terrible. I’m just trying to say that there’s a <em>lot</em> of possibilities, and some of them are surely good.</p>

<p>Suppose we could look 30 years into the future. Forums will no doubt look very different. Probably some of the differences rely on exogenous technological innovation. But surely <em>some</em> differences could be “back-ported” to today, if only we knew what they were. What are they, and why is the pace of innovation in online forums so slow right now?</p>



<p>If we want a historical example of “public forum with rules and norms carefully derived to find truth” I think the best we can do is the system of journal publications. For all their imperfections, these have done a decent job of uncovering truth for several hundred years. What lessons do these offer?</p>

<p>I think for our purposes, the three biggest differences vs. online forums today are:</p>

<p>First, journals have a <em>crazy</em> focus on <strong>credit attribution</strong>. There is a formalized system of citations. Reviewers check that the claimed new ideas in papers really are new, and that credit (citations) have been provided to all (most? some?) related work. One paper can reply (cite) to many other papers. (Journals share this with 4chan!)</p>

<p>Second, journals provide strong <strong>quality signals</strong> coupled to <strong>heavy “moderation”</strong>. In most fields there is a fairly clear status hierarchy. The moderators (reviewers/editors) at top journals spend a lot of effort moderating, and are very picky about what they accept. This provides strong signaling for the papers that are accepted.</p>

<p>Third, there are extremely strong <strong>external incentives</strong> for people to appear in the top journals. (Ultimately, jobs and money are on the line.)</p>

<p>There other differences (e.g. journals are slow and cost money) but I think the three above are the most significant. What would happen if we added these to online forums today? Unfortunately, it’s a bit hard to say. These wouldn’t be easy to copy. The first is laborious, and the others are as much properties of the society the journal is embedded in as the journal system itself.</p>



<p>Maybe figuring out how to improve forums is hard. As a first step, maybe we can at least understand where things go wrong? Here’s some proposed failure modes.</p>

<p><strong>The user death spiral.</strong> Some cool people start a forum and have cool conversations. Random trolls show up sometimes, but they are easily banned. Eventually, some not-quite-as-cool people find their way to the forum. They aren’t misbehaving and make some good points sometime. It feels tyrannical to ban them so no one does. Still, the coolest people become slightly more likely to drift away. New very-cool people become slightly less likely to join. Eventually the median shifts enough that barely-cool-at-all people are joining. Gradually, the average coolness of people in the forum decreases to zero.</p>

<p><strong>The tyranny of the minority.</strong> Human experience is vast. There are people out there who truly, passionately believe that bestiality should be legal and accepted. Some are smart and compelling writers. Almost all forums block these people. You don’t, figuring that you believe in free speech, these people are a tiny minority, and the truth will emerge as they argue with the majority. Suddenly, in every thread people are findings connections to the “injustice” of the current prohibition on bestiality. Why? Because every other high-status place on the internet prohibited these people, and they’ve all been funneled to you.</p>

<p><strong>The village becomes anonymous.</strong> In small forums, you see the same person repeatedly. This has two advantages: A) You know people will remember you, and you want them to be nice to you, so you try not to act like a jerk. B) After seeing the same people for a while, you have some <em>context</em> for their comments. The conversation can actually evolve and grow over time. After …</p></div></div></div></div></section></div>

<p>I ported a JavaScript “random art generator” I created a few years ago over to TypeScript. This post contains some notes from the process.</p>

<ul>
  <li>See the project: <a href="https://www.chrismytton.com/art/">www.chrismytton.com/art</a></li>
  <li>Check out the code: <a href="https://github.com/chrismytton/art/blob/1f34e99d121f2c7dd698eb8c9d45da1e9b7f450c/src/random.ts">chrismytton/art on GitHub</a></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>I’ve been learning TypeScript recently. As part of that I wanted to dig out some of my old JavaScript projects and port them to TypeScript. I find porting code to a new language is a good way to learn.</p>

<p>I found an old project that I created in 2014 which uses JavaScript and the Canvas API to create random pieces of art which change on every page load. The code itself is fairly straightforward, so it seemed like a good candidate for porting to TypeScript.</p>

<h2 id="classes-in-typescript">Classes in TypeScript</h2>

<p>TypeScript classes build on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes">ES6 classes</a>. The major difference is that in TypeScript you need to explicitly declare the types of properties you’re expecting on the class.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>CanvasPainting</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>viewport</span><span>:</span> <span>HTMLCanvasElement</span><span>;</span>
  <span>ctx</span><span>:</span> <span>CanvasRenderingContext2D</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you try to use <code>this.viewport</code> without declaring the property TypeScript will tell you:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Property ‘viewport’ does not exist on type ‘CanvasPainting’.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find having these properties explicitly defined actually makes it easier to figure out what the class might be doing internally. They provide useful documentation about what kind of data you can expect to find in each property.</p>

<h2 id="index-signatures">Index signatures</h2>

<p>This is something I struggled with for a while. I was trying to dynamically call methods on my <code>Shapes</code> class using <code>this[shape]</code>, but TypeScript was giving this warning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Element implicitly has an ‘any’ type because expression of type ‘string’ can’t be used to index type ‘Shapes’.</p>

  <p>No index signature with a parameter of type ‘string’ was found on type ‘Shapes’.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After reading various bits of the TypeScript documentation and some Stack Overflow answers I eventually figured out that I needed to define an index signature on my shapes class. This tells TypeScript what can be used to index this class, and what the indexing might return.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Shapes</span> <span>extends</span> <span>CanvasPainting</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>[</span><span>key</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>]:</span> <span>any</span><span>;</span>

  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This tells TypeScript that you can index this class with a string, and it will return <em>something</em>. There might be a way to avoid using <code>any</code> here, but I haven’t figured that out yet.</p>

<h2 id="dealing-with-null-values">Dealing with null values</h2>

<p>TypeScript knows which methods can return <code>null</code> and will make you deal with those cases. If you try to call a method on a value that might be null then TypeScript will give you a warning.</p>

<p>You can avoid this warning by explicitly checking for <code>null</code> before using the value.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>CanvasPainting</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>viewport</span><span>:</span> <span>HTMLCanvasElement</span><span>;</span>
  <span>ctx</span><span>:</span> <span>CanvasRenderingContext2D</span><span>;</span>

  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span><span>viewport</span><span>:</span> <span>HTMLCanvasElement</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>viewport</span> <span>=</span> <span>viewport</span><span>;</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>ctx</span> <span>=</span> <span>viewport</span><span>.</span><span>getContext</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>2d</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

    <span>// getContext can return null, so check for that case.</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>ctx</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>getContext('2d') failed</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>ctx</span> <span>=</span> <span>ctx</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Without this check for <code>null</code> TypeScript warns you that <code>Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'CanvasRenderingContext2D'.</code>.</p>

<p>It’s easy to forget to check for <code>null</code> when writing JavaScript. TypeScript protects you from this class of error at the compile stage.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>I really like what I’ve seen so far with TypeScript. Working on little projects like this is a great way to get some experience with new tools.</p>

<p>I’d forgotten all about this fun little art project. It’s nice to have given it a bit of polish and released it into the world, rather than it gathering dust on my hard drive.</p>

The sky was blood red. A thick shroud of smoke blocked the sun. Toxic ash fell from the sky.</p><p><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california-wildfires/article/The-day-the-sun-didn-t-come-up-People-in-15554470.php">“The day the sun didn’t rise”</a> marked a low point in the ongoing battle with the California wildfires that have killed dozens and displaced thousands. In some heavily populated regions, the air quality index has exceeded 400, far worse than recent measurements in Beijing or New Delhi. Residents have taken to sealing windows, vents and door jambs with masking tape and plastic. Air filters are out of stock and people already struggling to avoid exposure to a deadly microbe suddenly need to avoid exposure to deadly particulates as well. </p><p>Headlines have been quick to declare that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UW1MYQqvED4">“This Is Climate Change.”</a> Just as quickly, climate skeptics have <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2020/09/13/california-oregon-wildfires-land-management-climate-change/">challenged</a> the claim. Decades of poor forest management at the behest of environmentalists who oppose logging, they argue, is the real culprit. </p><p>Both are partly right. Climate change <em>is</em> making California’s wildfires worse. But California’s forestry policies have massively contributed to the problem. </p><p>Climate change has changed how fires burn in California. Tinder dry conditions make forests burn explosively. And because wildfire season is now fifty percent longer than in the past, it increasingly overlaps with the windiest time of year. For these reasons, small fires are much more likely to turn into big fires very quickly. </p><p>Yet climate change alone can’t explain the onslaught of catastrophic fires the state has faced in recent years. California’s forest and grassland ecosystems are naturally adapted to fire. But a century of fire suppression has turned the state’s forests into a gigantic fuel bunker. When forests like these don’t burn for decades, they become choked with small trees and dense underbrush. When fires do start, there is much more fuel to burn. </p><p>The alternative to burning in many areas is to thin forests, taking out the smaller trees and undergrowth so that there is less fuel and the trees that remain are more resistant to fire. But the state’s powerful environmental lobby has long opposed proposals to thin forests, criticizing them as a lifeline for the state’s failing timber industry.</p><p>Finally, suburban and exurban sprawl into the fire zone has exacerbated the problem. Millions of people now live in the middle of California’s forests, making efforts to limit fire risk through thinning, controlled burns, and other methods more complicated and more controversial.&nbsp; </p><p>Ultimately, it is impossible to disentangle the contributions that climate change, forest management, and suburban and exurban sprawl have made to increasing the risk of catastrophic wildfires in California. But while the causes can’t be disentangled, the solutions can. </p><p>Ambitious efforts to cut carbon emissions, both in California and globally, have much to recommend them. But saving California from fiery apocalypse is not among them. Until fuel loads are dramatically reduced in California’s forests, catastrophic wildfires will continue to wreak havoc across the state. Solving that problem will require a totally different approach to forest management than what either environmentalists or their critics have long favored. </p><p>The environmental community has traditionally advocated letting forests burn, as they did before the arrival of Europeans. But in a state with 39 million residents, many of whom live in close proximity to the fire zone, this is simply unrealistic. Even fires that are far removed from population centers create enormous public health risks. The fire responsible for San Francisco’s red sky at morning, for example, burned in a largely uninhabited area several hundred miles away. Until fuel loads are reduced sufficiently to transition forests back to less intense natural fire regimes, allowing remote fires to burn themselves out is likely to increase the choking smoke that now regularly settles over the state’s densely populated regions. </p><p>Meanwhile, conservatives who insist that the timber industry would, but for onerous environmental regulations, take care of the problem are completely out of touch with the state of the industry, the economics of logging California’s forests, and the reality of what is needed for effective long-term fuel reduction. The state’s remnant timber industry does not remotely have the capacity to thin the state’s forests at the necessary scale. Nor would doing so be economical in many forested regions of the state, as the big trees that pay the bills are largely gone. Even where logging is economically viable, removing mature trees is frequently counterproductive, since they tend to be replaced by more flammable undergrowth.</p><p>Ultimately, neither carbon caps nor subsidies for solar or wind energy will stop California’s wildfires. Resuscitating the timber industry won’t either. Limiting catastrophic wildfires in California will instead require intensive management of the state’s forests at an unprecedented scale. This will require a new, publicly funded forest management industry dedicated not to the extraction of valuable timber for private profit but rather to the removal of low-value underbrush and immature trees for public benefit.</p><p>In the rush to find convenient villains, both climate advocates and their opponents avoid harder policy choices. Conservatives insist that forest management, not climate change, is the cause of the problem—but are unwilling to support big spending to actively manage California forests. Environmentalists argue that climate change “changes everything”—but still insist that the solution to climate fueled megafires is to return to the state’s historic fire pattern. </p><p>Environmentalists are right that, over the long-term, we need to cut carbon emissions to something close to zero. And conservatives are also right that, without radical changes to both land use and forest management policy, catastrophic wildfires will continue to plague the state. To engage these issues in good faith, protagonists on both sides of the debate will need to follow their arguments through to their logical conclusions rather than refusing to accept any inference that contradicts their ideological priors. To succeed in addressing either climate change or California’s wildfires, we will need to stop debates about climate change from degenerating into a stale culture war rather than imagining that we might win them. </p><p><strong>Ted Nordhaus and Alex Trembath are executive director and deputy director, respectively, of the Breakthrough Institute.</strong></p></div></div>]]>

<p><span>I</span>t’s 3:13 a.m., and Radio Inspector Ashok Kumar turns around to look at his computer. His face stiffens. He zooms in on the screen and squints at an unauthorized SUV crossing a pontoon bridge.</p>



<p>Kumar and his team are in the Integrated Command and Control Center (ICCC) overlooking operations for this year’s Magh Mela, an annual Hindu pilgrimage and festival that draws millions of people in a single day. Each year, devotees from all across the country congregate at the spot where the Ganges, Yamuna, and mythical Saraswati rivers converge at Prayagraj in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. There, devotees dip in the water, which they believe cleanses them of their sins.</p>



<p>It is here at the ICCC, a big white room with two rows of desks, that the police keep a vigil over the mela (the Hindi word for “fair”). At each terminal, policemen hunch over computer screens as they monitor feeds from around 700 closed-circuit TV cameras. A video wall dominates, with 55-inch screens arranged in a 10 by 2 matrix along the length of the room. Khaki jackets emblazoned with “Uttar Pradesh Police” hang on the backs of the chairs. Tapping their shoeless feet on the carpeted floor, the officers glance at each other regularly, followed by tentative nods implying that everything is fine.</p>



<p>The monitoring team is on high alert. Kumar and his team have been here since 8 p.m. last night, on a 12-hour shift, and the first bathing rituals began at 3 a.m. Today is February 9, and it is the full moon day of Maghi Purnima. Police are expecting a crowd of 7.5 million — down from a single-day peak of 11 million two weeks earlier. Millions of pilgrims will be leaving after today’s dip. Many are joined by their families, who have come to take them home.</p>



<p>Kumar’s job is to keep this massive crowd under control. Stampedes, terror attacks, and theft are on his mind. He places a call, and minutes after the SUV is vetted, a police officer appears on-screen to set up a barricade at the foot of the bridge.</p>



<p>Outside, as LED lights switch off, an easterly sunrise turns the sky several shades of crimson. On the water, the boats stand out in silhouette. The air contains a mix of piety and festivity.</p>

<hr>



<p><strong>The Magh Mela</strong> is a smaller version of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumbh_Mela"> Kumbh Mela</a>, the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_peaceful_gatherings"> largest human gathering</a> on earth. The Kumbh is held every six years, and the previous one was held in 2019. Over 49 days last year, more than 250 million people took a dip in the <em>sangam</em>, the point where the three rivers meet, with the biggest one-day crowd reaching 50 million. It was the second-largest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_peaceful_gatherings">gathering</a> in history.</p>



<p>To prepare for the melas, tens of thousands of officials spend months setting up a massive temporary city on the banks of the Ganges. Viewed from above, it is a colorful patchwork divided by big and small bodies of water. Much of this — tents, floating bridges, and metal sheet roads — is built specifically for the festival. As the riverbed floods every year, the city lasts for only several months before the Ganges threatens to reclaim the land.</p>



<p>The physical structure of the mela changes each year, depending on the river. The groundwork usually starts in October, after monsoon season, when the Ganges retreats. Temporary roads are marked, and pontoon bridges are built to join land separated by water. Jetties are built on the banks; the roads are lined with metal sheets; pipelines and electricity cables are laid. Bathing stations are set up along a 3-mile floating jetty, with nets spread underneath to catch those who fall in.</p>



<p>This year, the Ganges’ water levels remained high later than usual. “We could reclaim land only by the end of November, but heavy rains kept hampering civil works until December,” says Rajneesh Mishra, a civil servant who oversees the Mela. This year’s mela was spread over 270 hectares (667 acres), about 30% bigger than Monaco, and divided into six sectors for administrative purposes. Setting up the infrastructure was — and is — an immense logistical feat. The mela has 13 police stations, 40 police outposts, and five thermal power stations. There are five hospitals with operation theaters and 25 beds each, as well as labs, testing facilities, and on-site ambulances.</p>



<p>All of this requires a substantial budget. For this year’s mela, the state<strong> </strong>government budgeted $77 million. Last year, for the Kumbh, it spent $558 million.</p>



<p>All IT operations for the festival are run by the ICCC, which is based in a three-story concrete building that was inaugurated a little over a year ago by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It’s one of the few permanent structures in the mela area, besides a temple and a 16th-century fort. The center itself is divided up between the monitoring room, which uses a video surveillance system to keep a bird’s-eye view on the mela; the wireless grid room, which liaises between monitors and the ground staff; the war room, where personnel from the fire, water, and police departments as well as the military are on hand at all hours to deal with emergencies; and, finally, a call center.</p>



<p>The key tool in the ICCC’s arsenal is the crowd management application (CMA) system, which keeps an eye on crowd density across all 700 camera feeds. The system is taught how much ground area each CCTV camera covers, which then allows it to estimate, with 85% accuracy, the number of people in a space at any given time. If there are more than three people per square meter, the system issues a warning, and the ground police team is notified and instructed to stop, hold, or divert the crowd.</p>



<p>The Prayagraj Smart City Mission team, which oversees the ICCC, considered various methods for crowd management before settling on the CMA. One option was to estimate crowd size by measuring an area’s smartphone density. But this idea was quickly scrapped. Most devotees at Magh Mela are not smartphone users, says assistant manager Vipin Singh. Only <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/tech/smartphone-users-in-india-crossed-500-million-in-2019-states-report-2479529.html">500 million</a> people in India — roughly one-third of the population — own smartphones. Additionally, many families share one phone, and rural residents (who form as much as 95% of mela attendees, according to police estimates) often don’t use them at all. “If the system shows three people,” says Singh, “there might actually be 100, where 97 are carrying basic mobile phones or no phones at all.”</p>



<p>Last year, officials also experimented with a facial recognition system. The idea was that the technology would provide accurate headcounts, track patterns of movement, and measure time spent between distinct points. But that didn’t work either, as people often carry big bags on their heads as they navigate mela crowds. That meant that, for every face the system could see, a piece of luggage might conceal several more.</p>



<p>Cars have proven easier to track. The automated number plate recognition (ANPR) system records the license number of every vehicle entering or exiting the city, checking it against a database containing the license numbers of stolen vehicles and ones involved in crimes. If a match is found, an alert goes off. For this Magh Mela, says Singh, the administration installed ANPR-aided cameras at eight locations on the city’s periphery. But there are plans to ramp up. “For the next mela,” he says, “we’re looking to increase this to 28 locations.”</p>

<p><strong>It’s 7:17 a.m.</strong> Mamta Sharma<strong> </strong>stands knee-deep in the river.</p>



<p>Facing east toward the Ganges, she presses her hands in a namaste. She bows her head several times and chants a prayer under her breath. And then she takes a dip in the river, repeating it four times.</p>



<p>Seagulls glide over the heads of bowing devotees, but neither seem to mind the other. When pilgrims toss bits of fruit into the river, the seagulls scoop them up before they land in the water.</p>



<p>Some devotees hire boats to get to the point believed to be the exact location where the three rivers meet. There, people offer their respects to the river, take dips, and fill plastic cans with sacred water. At the <em>sangam</em>, you can see colors mixing, says boatman Ajay Nishad. “The whitish water is that of the Ganges, and the black that of the Yamuna,” he says. Stare long enough and one might think that he is right.</p>



<p>People who can’t afford to hire a boat, which is most pilgrims, instead bathe close to the bank. The mela administration encourages this to avoid overcrowding.</p>



<p>Sharma comes out of the river. Still dripping, she makes a video call to her mother, who could not come with her. She pans her phone to show the <em>sangam</em> to her mother, who offers namaste multiple times, her eyes welling up.</p>



<p>While she dries off, Sharma keeps looking up expectantly. On some auspicious days, the mela administration showers flowers on bathing devotees from a helicopter. She has seen videos of it on social media. “We were all excited about it, but it hasn’t happened today,” she says.</p>



<p>“Still, the holy dip is quite an experience.”</p>



<p>Sharma, who lives in Kolkata in eastern India, has come to the Magh Mela with a group of 12. They live in different cities but come from the same family in Jaunpur, over 100 kilometers from here. Most are elderly. At 31, Sharma is the youngest.</p>



<p>Nishad, the boatman, has been ferrying visitors to the <em>sangam</em> for three years, and he says the melas are always very well organized. Police designate holding areas to keep people safe when crowds swell, and are good at managing foot traffic to prevent bottlenecks. While it can take several hours to find missing people — pilgrims getting separated is a common problem at melas — he says the administration always tracks them down.</p>



<p>But, lately, he has noticed something new. …</p></div></div>

<p>“Civil Rap Song,” a <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/international/9392471/japan-dos-monos-civil-rap-song-taiwan-digital-minister-audrey-tang-watch-new-video">track</a> by the Japanese hip-hop trio Dos Monos, begins not with an MC’s rhymes but a faraway voice speaking slow, bureaucratic English. The deconstructed audio is sampled over gloomy synth:<em> “If you overemphasize … amplifying the public and private sector … where is the civic sector? … where is the social sector?”</em> Made in less than a week during Japan’s state of emergency over Covid-19, the track was intended to be “culturally empowering,” according to a band member — a way to remind the public that it still had choices, even in the midst of a crisis.</p>



<p>The speaker in the song is 39-year-old Audrey Tang, a prodigy hacker turned activist turned digital minister in the Taiwanese government. Tang, who wears rimless glasses and dark, baggy clothes by Issey Miyake, does not fit the profile of a rapper’s muse. Yet over the course of the coronavirus pandemic, which her country has managed with singular, tech-enabled ease, she has become an international messenger of Taiwan’s “radically transparent” “digital democracy.” For Tang, the Taiwanese model offers an imitable middle ground: between the internet and personal privacy; between corporate interests and the welfare state.</p>



<p>Before Covid-19, you may have heard of Tang if you followed Taiwanese news, tech gossip, or transgender politics. She is considered one of Taiwan’s top coders, having taught herself the programming languages Haskell and Perl before developing software for Apple that would be used in Siri. In the spring of 2014, when news that Taiwan’s then-president Ma Ying-jeou had threatened the island nation’s independence by attempting to force through a trade deal with China, Tang quit a job at Socialtext, where she worked on Google Suite–like productivity software, to join a scrum of hackers gathered outside the main government building in Taipei. This was the beginning of the Sunflower Movement, a popular uprising against the prospect of national absorption, and Tang helped broadcast the protests and debates online. After a nearly monthlong occupation, Ma was forced to abandon the pact, and the Sunflower activists turned to political organizing. They successfully ran progressive candidates in the 2014 local elections and, in 2016, elected Tsai Ing-wen as president. Tsai’s administration recruited Tang to become the first out transgender person in Taiwan’s executive cabinet.</p>



<p>While Tang’s title is “digital minister,” she is a minister without a ministry. As one of nine <a href="http://www.politicseastasia.com/research/audrey_tang_interview/">“horizontal ministers,”</a> she advises other parts of the government on all things tech — and, because she happens to be obsessed with the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals — environmental overlaps. In 2017, for instance, she and her staff worked with the Ministry of the Interior and a risk-management agency to combine separate systems used to prevent and respond to natural disasters. Upon Tang’s recommendation, the government agreed to implement a new cloud-based interface to trim costs and give the public quick, easy access to information on floods, fires, and extreme weather. Last year, during the second <a href="https://www.roc-taiwan.org/uk_en/post/6295.html">“presidential hackathon,”</a> an annual event that invites startup-style ideas for governance, she helped facilitate the development of a solar-powered device that can measure and log water-pollution levels on an open-source blockchain. Soon, any citizen worried about downstream industrial waste will be able to buy a few of these monitors, drop them in a creek, and create a dataset to hold corporations and local officials accountable to environmental regulations.</p>



<p>This is clearly government work, but Tang, at her core a hacker iconoclast, bristles at the notion that she works <em>for </em>Taipei. She still prefers to see herself as a liaison, or, in her words, “a moderator or editor,” between the public and the state. This explains why Tang — though not a doctor or epidemiologist — found herself at the center of Taiwan’s response to Covid-19.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When rumors of a dangerous flu emerged from Wuhan, China, last December, the Taiwanese reacted fast. Carrying the memory of the 2003 SARS epidemic, they rushed to buy face masks, threatening to deplete local supplies. In the city of Tainan, an engineer named Howard Wu created a fix: a mapping system to track available masks, using Google GPS and Places API. The platform was an immediate hit. Tang reached out to Wu and secured funding from Google to support and extend the project, which eventually inspired a similar system in South Korea. By spring, the Taiwanese government was managing the supply and distribution of cheap N95-type masks through neighborhood pharmacies. All 24 million residents of Taiwan could buy a certain number per week, at any pharmacy, based on their national health insurance card. Long lines got shorter, and people went about social distancing with confidence. The success of this model — Taiwan has had fewer than 500 total cases and just seven deaths — was what attracted the Dos Monos rappers to Tang.</p>



<p>It helped that, in East Asia, masks were “already ‘natural’ before the pandemic; we didn’t have to invent new things,” Tang said. In response to the common, mostly Western critique that East Asian technocracy relies too much on digital surveillance, Tang explained that Taiwan’s containment method involved “a deep but very narrow and time-limited privacy infringement: You either, when flying back, go to the quarantine hotel for 14 days, or you can choose the digital fence,” that is, submit to strict tracking. “We do not collect new data,” she added. “It’s not a new app. It’s not GPS. People understand it’s proportional.” Taiwan also invested in fact-checking startups and enlisted comedians to craft lighthearted responses to Covid-19 disinformation and consumer misbehavior. In a public-service announcement intended to stem panic-buying of toilet paper, a cartoon version of Tang’s boss, Premier Su Tseng-chang, shimmies his rear end beneath the <a href="https://qz.com/1863931/taiwan-is-using-humor-to-quash-coronavirus-fake-news/">words</a>, “You only have one butt.”</p>



<p>When I spoke with Tang via Skype in July, she referred to Taiwan as “post-pandemic.” The country had never shut down completely, and its streets, markets, and schools were beginning to feel normal. She had just made her morning commute in downtown Taipei, a 15-minute walk from Da’an Park, past the Jianguo flower market, to a broad concrete complex surrounded by lush trees. There, in an open-air arcade that once belonged to the air force, is the Social Innovation Lab, the headquarters of Tang’s digital non-ministry. She dialed in from her office, which resembled the lounge of a coworking space. A vertical Chinese scroll hung over her right shoulder: “More and more graceful every day.”</p>



<p>Tang had been holding public “office hours” on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and was booked through September to chat with locals about tech and government policy, entrepreneurship, and sustainability. Nearly all her interactions, including media interviews and meetings with lobbyists, are subject to a “radical transparency” policy: They are recorded, transcribed, and posted online for all to see. Tang also holds regular virtual visits with communities all over Taiwan.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“<strong>Any top-down, coercion, whether it’s from the capitalists or from the state, is equally bad.”</strong></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>During a recent one, entrepreneurs from Taiwan’s indigenous community pressed for changes to the business code. Tang listened and recalled a solution she helped devise last year, when Taiwan became the first Asian country to legalize same-sex marriage. Many older, conservative Taiwanese could accept that gay people should have equal rights but felt reluctant to have their extended-family registries — official, patrilineal records stretching back to the early 20th century — reflect LGBT unions. The fix was a “hyperlink act” that, with a single click, would amend relevant sections of the civil code to give queer couples the same rights and duties as anyone else but would not, as with straight marriages, “hyperlink to the in-laws,” meaning that the families of the same-sex couple wouldn’t be permanently bonded in the eyes of the state. “Their families don’t wed. It’s the individuals that wed,” she told me. “It’s a social innovation that convinced both generations that the values that they cherish are not disrupted when we pass marriage equality. It’s marriage equality with intergenerational solidarity.”</p>



<p>It’s also a compromise. Tang, whose mother was active in Taiwan’s cooperative movement before the country transitioned to democracy, much prefers collaboration to battle. This might relate as well to another aspect of Tang’s childhood: she was born with a heart defect and often talks about the virtues of unhurried observation. “If you’re slow in your motion, you tend to notice other, nonhuman beings,” she told me — trees, rivers, computers. As digital minister, she invoked this cooperative ideal to implement Pol.is, an online discussion board where Taiwanese people can engage in a “rough-consensus process” about social issues, such as what sorts of rules should govern Uber or how best to combat the spread of revenge porn. To prevent trolling, the platform functions without a reply button.</p>



<p>Taiwan’s constitution prohibits private businesses from acting against “the balanced development of national wealth and people’s livelihood,” yet the country’s most famous corporation is high-tech Apple supplier Foxconn, which gained notoriety for driving its mainland Chinese factory workers to suicide. I asked whether the cruelties of big businesses hadn’t dimmed Tang’s faith in the possibility of social equilibrium. “The manufacturing companies, they learned, of course, not to do [things with] adverse effects within Taiwan proper,” she replied, referring to Foxconn’s compounds in mainland China. But the next generation of Taiwanese entrepreneurs, she said, will use robotics to reduce worker exploitation, embrace “worker associations,” and pursue …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>A few months ago I started learning Rust, and in the process I ended up contributing to an open source project for the first time. It turned out to be a great vehicle for learning Rust, so in this post I’d like to go over what I did and why I think it was a good learning experience. In particular I want to walk through my thought process as I navigated my first open source contribution in the hopes that others who face similar challenges are encouraged to overcome them. Throughout this post I’ll also explain more about how this helped me learn Rust.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>The main impetus for deciding to learn Rust was that I had read a lot of great reviews and Rust seemed to be growing in popularity, so I thought it would be a nice addition to my tool-belt. I also use C++ in my day job and saw that Rust was trying to improve on some of the drawbacks of C++ (like easily writing safe, concurrent code), so I wanted to start investigating for myself.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was read <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">The Rust Programming Language</a> (which I highly recommend for anyone else new to Rust!). I breezed through it fairly quickly, dutifully completing all of the exercises. Once I finished, I still felt like I had the training wheels on and I wanted to learn more. I briefly thought about finding <em>another</em> guide or tutorial to go through, but luckily I realized that was a one-way ticket to <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-escape-tutorial-purgatory-as-a-new-developer-or-at-any-time-in-your-career-e3a4b2384a40/">tutorial purgatory</a>, before getting in too deep. To be clear, the book (and most language introduction texts in my opinion) was great for understanding the basics and acting as a reference as I got more experience with the language. It’s just that I wanted to get to the next level of understanding and be able to write new code from scratch (take off the training wheels). In order to do that, I needed a project to sink my teeth into and push myself towards that deeper level of understanding.</p>

<p>In general at this point I could have done one of two things: start my own project or help with someone else’s project. I spent a decent amount of time trying to think of an exciting project, but I didn’t have any great ideas off the top of my head. Plus I had already accumulated plenty of small, unfinished toy projects on Github, so I started investigating the open source route. That way I would get clear instructions on what needed to get done and I could simply focus on improving my Rust abilities.</p>

<p>This wasn’t the first time I’ve thought about contributing to open source. I’ve had a desire to start contributing to open source software ever since college, but I never felt like I was good enough to help out. It was a clear case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">imposter syndrome</a>. I imagine there are many other developers who have run into this feeling. Certainly it’s much more common in an interview but the idea here is the same. There’s no fool proof way of shaking off imposter syndrome, but the fact that I didn’t personally know any of the project maintainers helped me at least decide to give it a shot!</p>

<p>Once I stopped focusing on all the things that could go wrong for a second, I started to realize how beneficial contributing to an open source project could be in my quest to learn Rust. There are multiple experienced developers reviewing your code who know way more about the language and tools you are using so they can quickly explain important concepts you might not understand or even know about. You get the chance to have discussions with people all over the world who have their own ideas for a solution. I think anywhere you can find a cross-pollination of ideas like this is a great place to learn. The trick is to not be afraid to admit you don’t know something, or that your idea is wrong. By no means is it easy to do this, but once you do it is quite liberating!</p>

<h2 id="clippy">Clippy</h2>

<p>The next step was to find a project to contribute to. After googling a couple variations of “rust open source projects for beginners”, I found <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">Clippy</a>. The best summary comes from their Github: “A collection of lints to catch common mistakes and improve your Rust code”. I am always a fan of developer productivity and encouraging good coding standards, so this project seemed perfect! Part of the reason I picked this project is because the maintainers do a great job of labeling issues that are easier with ‘good first issue’ so that I could quickly find potential issues to solve. I recommend finding a project like this as it makes the initial experience with open source much smoother. Being able to choose from multiple issues that were better suited for beginners reduced the overwhelming feeling of being new. I still had to do plenty of work to acclimate myself with the new code base and the issue I was trying to solve, but I was able to proceed knowing that I was not out of my league.</p>

<p>I ended up volunteering to add a new lint for the use of <code>.nth(0)</code> on any iterator. I’ll post a link to the issue at the end of this post, but the basic idea is that Rust developers should call <code>.next()</code> on the iterator instead of <code>.nth(0)</code> (if you’re curious, check out the docs for <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.nth">nth</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#tymethod.next">next</a> to see why this is desired). It was my job to make Clippy output a helpful suggestion anytime this situation is found. I forked and cloned the repository, and then spent some time building the code and running the tests. I think this is important to do, especially in a new language, so that you can get familiar with the build system first and focus on implementing your solution after. Another reason Clippy was a nice place to start was there are hundreds of lints and therefore hundreds of other examples of what I had to do. I searched for examples of similar lints to the one I was implementing so I could start to understand which parts of the code I needed to change. After a while I was able to cobble together some changes, but I was pretty confident they were not correct. I was stuck and didn’t really know what to do. I returned to the Clippy Github page to see if I could find any useful information and found this in <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First: if you’re unsure or afraid of <strong>anything</strong>, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyway. You won’t be yelled at for giving it your best effort. The worst that can happen is that you’ll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate any sort of contributions, and don’t want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They know this is going to happen, and they welcome the pull requests anyway. Clearly my best course of action was to push it up, admit I’m stuck, and ask for help. It felt weird pushing up code I know did not work, but the reason I chose to do this in the first place was to learn so I pushed up the branch and asked for a review.</p>

<h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>

<p>As I suspected, there were more than a few problems with my initial implementation, but that’s okay! I received encouraging and helpful feedback from multiple users. I learned new macros in Rust like <a href="https://docs.rs/if_chain/1.0.0/if_chain/">if_chain</a>, and was guided towards more helpful examples in the code related to what I needed to do. After a bit more back and forth, my pull request was merged! It was a great feeling knowing that I contributed at least in a small way to software that is used by thousands of developers every day!</p>

<p>I think it’s important to make a special note about the initial round of feedback I received. It wasn’t condescending or mean, even though I missed some things that by now have become second nature to the maintainers. I received simple, encouraging, and timely feedback that allowed me to quickly make changes and not feel bad about getting it wrong the first time. If the feedback is too complex, disrespectful, or takes forever there’s a good chance I wouldn’t want to contribute to the project again. What’s worse, I may write off contributing to open source altogether! Creating a welcoming environment for new contributors is key to establishing a thriving open source project.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>So, what did I learn about Rust after this whole experience? Well, there’s still so much to learn but after reading <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">The Rust Programming Language</a> I was particularly intrigued by Rust’s idea of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html">ownership</a>. I was immediately able to make a connection to my professional work in C++, particularly with regards to <a href="https://www.internalpointers.com/post/c-rvalue-references-and-move-semantics-beginners">move semantics and rvalue references</a>. Rust makes it very explicit who can read and modify data, and the compiler will yell at you if you break the rules. These rules help prevent multiple threads from modifying the same piece of data at the same time, also known as a data race. C++’s rules around data ownership and mutability are less strict, so the compiler cannot protect you from data races as much as it can in Rust. Just by writing Rust code for Clippy and being exposed to the rules that the Rust compiler enforces made me a better C++ programmer in this aspect. Now I am explicitly thinking about ownership and mutability when I write C++ code even though there are no rules forcing me to do so.</p>

<p>Other concepts I found interesting were <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-00-enums.html">pattern matching</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html">recoverable errors</a>, which I had no experience with before. Contributing to Clippy gave me valuable experience dealing with these ideas and helped solidify my understanding. These features of the language, among others, were my first significant exposure to functional programming language concepts. Having come from an almost exclusively procedural background, it was interesting to see the two worlds collide. I was excited to have discovered something new, and I look forward to learning more about functional programming languages in the future as well!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>To wrap things up I want to reiterate some key lessons I learned from contributing to an open source project for the first time. I think it’s really important to find the right project and have a positive mindset when trying to jump into the open source world. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Find a project that has a label for beginners, such as ‘good first issue’. These labels reduce the burden of finding an issue to choose, which can be overwhelming on large projects.</li>
  <li>Take a look at some of the …</li></ul></article></div>

				<p>Back in November 2019, <a target="blank" href="https://cis-india.org/internet-governance/blog/reliance-jio-is-using-sni-inspection-to-block-websites">we reported</a> that Reliance Jio is able to block HTTPS internet traffic by means of a deep packet inspection (DPI) technique. In response, some readers messaged us saying that they ran our test and were able to reproduce similar behaviour on Airtel mobile networks. According to <a href="https://trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/PIR_08012020_0.pdf" target="_blank">TRAI's Performance Indicators report for Jul-Sep 2019</a>, Reliance Jio and Airtel serve roughly 52% and 23% of internet subscribers in India respectively. <strong>This essentially means that SNI inspection based censorship is now impacting every 3 out of 4 internet connections in India.</strong></p>

<p>Although the previous test was able to detect the presence of SNI inspection based censorship, it was not very insightful. In this post, we delve into a more informative test which not only confirms the presence of SNI inspection based censorship, but also helps us identify the exact mechanism. Furthermore, it also allows us to identify middleboxes which are actively inspecting SNI in TLS handshakes and censoring requests. <strong>Using this method, we were able to discover 25 different middleboxes registered to Airtel, which are actively censoring HTTPS traffic.</strong></p>

<p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol for providing communication confidentiality and authenticity, commonly used for encrypting web traffic (as done in HTTPS). Normally TLS is used over TCP, as it requires a reliable in-order data stream. A <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls" target="_blank">quick refresher</a> on TLS by Cloudflare.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OlMYujg.png" alt="img">
</p><center>A TCP handshake followed by a TLS Handshake. The ClientHello is a message sent by the client, which initiates the TLS handshake. This message can contain extensions such as SNI. Image credits - <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake/">Cloudflare</a></center>



<h3 id="servernameindication">Server Name Indication</h3>

<p>Server Name Indication (SNI), defined first in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4366" target="_blank">RFC4366</a> and then in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6066" target="_blank">RFC6066</a>, is a TLS extension designed to facilitate the hosting of multiple HTTPS websites on the same IP address. While sending a <code>ClientHello</code> message (which initiates the establishment of a secure connection), the client is expected to fill in the SNI attribute with the hostname of the website it wishes to connect to. SNI, unfortunately, travels on the network in cleartext, i.e. <strong>network operators can not only see the websites you’re visiting, but also filter traffic based on this information.</strong></p>

<hr>





<p>Since the SNI present is in cleartext, anyone in the network can inspect and filter traffic based on its value. As seen in other countries, ISPs can leverage this to deny access to certain websites. We can observe the same by attempting a TLS connection using openssl and monitoring packets to the host.  </p>

<pre><code>openssl s_client -state -connect 103.224.212.222:443 -servername fullhd720.com  
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kush789/INT-SNI/master/images/airtel_103.224.212.222_fullhd720.com.png" alt="img">
</p><center>An attempted TLS connection to <code>103.224.212.222</code>, with SNI <code>fullhd720.com</code>. We observe a RST packet immediately after the ClientHello message containing the SNI is sent.</center>

<p>For instance, using Airtel, we can see that the client receives a TCP RST packet when it tries to connect to a blocked website "fullhd720.com". The RST packet seems to be originating from the actual host, and is received right after the ClientHello message containing the SNI is sent. <a href="https://github.com/kush789/INT-SNI/blob/master/pcaps/airtel_103.224.212.222_fullhd720.com.pcap" target="_blank">PCAP</a>.</p>

<p>To confirm that the connection termination was indeed due to the SNI, we can reattempt the connection with a different SNI which we don't expect to be blocked (in this case we use <code>facebook.com</code>).</p>

<pre><code>openssl s_client -state -connect 103.224.212.222:443 -servername facebook.com  
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kush789/INT-SNI/master/images/airtel_103.224.212.222_facebook.com.png" alt="img">
</p><center>An attempted TLS connection to <code>103.224.212.222</code> with a different SNI, <code>facebook.com</code>. In this case, we observe a successful TLS handshake</center>

<p>This time we notice a successful connection, indicating that the RST in the previous attempt was indeed due to the specified SNI. <a href="https://github.com/kush789/INT-SNI/blob/master/pcaps/airtel_103.224.212.222_facebook.com.pcap" target="_blank">PCAP</a>.</p>

<p>Although this test does demonstrate the presence of SNI inspection based censorship, the packet dumps are not sufficient to prove that the RST packet was actually forged by a middlebox belonging to the ISP.</p>

<hr>  





<p>For a given host, let's call the minimum Time to Live (<a href="https://packetpushers.net/ip-time-to-live-and-hop-limit-basics/" target="_blank">TTL</a>) required for a packet to reach from the client to the host, <code>min_ttl</code>. Any packet where the TTL set is less than <code>min_ttl</code> would expire in transit, and never reach the host. Ideally, the router at which the TTL of the packet expired should respond with an ICMP Time Exceeded (<a href="http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/protocol/icmp/msg11.htm" target="_blank">ICMP message type 11</a>) message. However, this is not guaranteed, and some routers are even configured to not send them (in order to hide the topology of the network).</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aSrR375.png" alt="img">
</p><center>Iterative Network Tracing; we send ClientHello messages with increasing TTL. In this particular case, the minimum TTL required is 9. A middlebox which censors requests would send back a censored response even when the TTL is less than 9. Image credits - <a href="#cite1">Yadav et al.</a></center>

<p>So if the RST received is forged by a middlebox, we should receive it even when we send the ClientHello message with TTL less than <code>min_ttl</code>. This approach, known as Iterative Network Tracing (INT), has been previously used to ascertain the presence of middleboxes which censor DNS and HTTP traffic in India [<a href="#cite1">Yadav et al.</a>] and China <a href="#cite2">Xu et al.</a> Similar to these studies, we use INT to detect censorship of TLS traffic (explained further in the <a href="#secMethod">methodology</a> section).</p>

<hr>  





<p>We run our tests using a list of potentially blocked websites (PBWs), curated from leaked court and government orders. The list and more information pertaining to it can be found <a href="https://github.com/kush789/How-India-Censors-The-Web-Data" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Using Google's DNS over HTTPS (DoH) <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/doh" target="_blank">service</a>, each hostname was resolved to its correct IP address. Using DoH here is important as it ensures that no DNS based censorship intervenes with the test. This resulted in roughly 5000 (hostname, ip) pairs. Next we selected a random subset and checked for TCP connectivity to port 443 to each of those ips (since not all would support HTTPS traffic), filtering our list down to 1370 pairs.</p>

<p>For each of these test points, we establish a TCP connection with the resolved_ip, and send a TLS ClientHello with the SNI set as the correct_hostname. We sniff and save these ClientHello packets (just the SSL layer) for use later. Similarly, we save the ClientHello packet with the SNI set as <code>facebook.com</code>. These sniffed packets can be found <a href="https://github.com/kush789/INT-SNI/tree/master/tls_client_hellos" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<hr>  





<p>The input to the test is a 2-tuple, (<code>correct_hostname</code>, <code>resolved_ip</code>). We would like to understand the behaviour of a middlebox when it observes a ClientHello message containing an SNI for a website it wishes to block.</p>

<p>First, we calculate the <code>min_ttl</code> for a given test point. We begin by establishing a TCP connection with <code>resolved_ip</code>.</p>

<pre><code>import socket  
import random  
from scapy.all import *

resolved_ip = "103.224.212.222"  
dport = 443 # TLS connection  
sport = random.randint(1024, 65535) # Random source port

def create_connection(resolved_ip):  
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_PACKET, socket.SOCK_RAW)
    s.bind(("usb0", 0)) # Was using a tethered mobile connection for the experiment

    IP_PACKET = IP(dst = resolved_ip)

    seq = random.randint(12345, 67890) # Randomise initial seq number
    SYN = TCP(sport = sport, dport = dport, flags = "S", seq = seq)
    SYNACK = sr1(IP_PACKET / SYN)
    ACK = TCP(sport = sport, dport = dport, flags = "A", seq = seq + 1, ack = SYNACK.seq + 1)
    send(IP_PACKET / ACK)
    return IP_PACKET, ACK
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: When the linux kernel feature gets a TCP packet to an unknown socket, it sends a RST back to the originator. Since we'll be creating our own raw sockets, we need to suppress these outbound RSTs from the kernel using iptables before running experiments.</p>

<pre><code>sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags RST RST -j DROP  
</code></pre>

<p>Once the TCP connection has been established, we send ClientHello messages (containing <code>facebook.com</code> in SNI) after updating the TTL (<code>probe_ttl</code>) in the underlying IP header. We specify <code>facebook.com</code> in the SNI so that the middlebox doesn't attempt to terminate the connection. <code>min_ttl</code> would be the minimum TTL at which we receive a TLS ServerHello or TLS Alert from the host.</p>

<pre><code># Load ClientHello with garbled hostname in SNI (sniffed earlier, read Data Preparation)
max_ttl = 35

def find_min_ttl(resolved_ip)

    with open("tls_client_hellos/facebook.com", 'rb') as fp:
        tls_client_hello_facebook_com_sni = fp.read()

    for probe_ttl in range(1, max_ttl):
        IP_PACKET, ACK = create_connection(resolved_ip)
        IP_PACKET.ttl = probe_ttl
        del IP_PACKET.chksum # Will force scapy to recalculate checksum after TTL update

        resp, _ = sr(IP_PACKET / ACK / tls_client_hello_facebook_com_sni, timeout = 2, retry = 0, multi = True)

        for _, ans_packet in resp:
            tls_alert = ans_packet.get(tls.TLS, {}).get(tls.TLSAlert)
            tls_server_hello = ans_packet.get(tls.TLS, {}).get(tls.TLSHandshakes, {}).get(tls.TLSServerHello)

            if tls_alert or tls_server_hello:
                return probe_ttl # min_ttl found!
</code></pre>

<p>Next, we send ClientHello messages containing the <code>correct_hostname</code> in the SNI with TTL increasing from 1 to <code>min_ttl</code> - 1. If there is no middlebox interfering with the connection, all such requests should receive either an ICMP Time Exceeded in response or no response at all. If at any point we receive an RST packet which seems to be originating from <code>resolved_ip</code>, we can say with certainty that the packet was forged by a middlebox.</p>

<pre><code>min_ttl = find_min_ttl(resolved_ip, tls_client_hello)

with open("tls_client_hellos/fullhd720.com", 'rb') as fp:  
    tls_client_hello_correct_sni = fp.read()

for probe_ttl in range(1, min_ttl):  
    IP_PACKET, ACK = create_connection(resolved_ip)
    IP_PACKET.ttl …</code></pre></section></div>

<div>
<h2 id="overview"><a href="#overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<div>
<p>Crux is optimised for efficient and globally consistent point-in-time queries
using a pair of <code>transaction-time</code> and <code>valid-time</code> timestamps.</p>
<p>Ad-hoc systems for bitemporal recordkeeping typically rely on explicitly
tracking either <code>valid-from</code> and <code>valid-to</code> timestamps or range types directly
within relations.  The bitemporal document model that Crux provides is very
simple to reason about and it is universal across the entire database,
therefore it does not require you to consider which historical information is
worth storing in special "bitemporal tables" upfront.</p>
<p>One or more documents may be inserted into Crux via a <code>put</code> transaction at a
specific <code>valid-time</code>, defaulting to the <code>transaction time</code> (i.e. <code>now</code>), and
each document remains valid until explicitly updated with a new version via
<code>put</code> or deleted via <code>delete</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="why"><a href="#why"></a>Why?</h2>
<div>
<p>The rationale for bitemporality is also explained in this
<a href="https://juxt.pro/blog/posts/value-of-bitemporality.html">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>A baseline notion of time that is always available is
<code>transaction-time</code>; the point at which data is transacted into the
database.</p>
<p>Bitemporality is the addition of another time-axis: <code>valid-time</code>.</p>
<table id="table-conversion">
<caption>Table 1. Time Axes</caption>
<colgroup>
<col>

</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Time</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p><code>transaction-time</code></p></td>
<td><p>Used for audit purposes, technical requirements such as event sourcing.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><code>valid-time</code></p></td>
<td><p>Used for querying data across time, historical analysis.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><code>transaction-time</code> represents the point at which data arrives into the
database. This gives us an audit trail and we can see what the state
of the database was at a particular point in time. You cannot write a
new transaction with a <code>transaction-time</code> that is in the past.</p>
<p><strong>valid-time</strong> is an arbitrary time that can originate from an upstream
 system, or by default is set to transaction-time. Valid time is
 what users will typically use for query purposes.</p>

<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<i title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td>
In Crux, when <code>transaction-time</code> isn’t specified, it is set to
<em>now</em>. When writing data, in case there isn’t any specific valid-time
available, valid-time and transaction-time take the same value.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="valid"><a href="#valid"></a>Valid Time</h2>
<div>
<p>In situations where your database is not the ultimate owner of the data—where
corrections to data can flow in from various sources and at various times—use
of <strong>transaction-time</strong> is inappropriate for historical queries.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a financial trading system and you want to perform
calculations based on the official 'end of day', that occurs each day at 17:00
hours. Does all the data arrive into your database at exactly 17:00? Or does
the data arrive from an upstream source where we have to allow for data to
arrive out of order, and where some might always arrive after 17:00?</p>
<p>This can often be the case with high throughput systems where there
are clusters of processing nodes, enriching the data before it gets to
our store.</p>
<p>In this example, we want our queries to include the straggling bits of
data for our calculation purposes, and this is where <strong>valid-time</strong>
comes in. When data arrives into our database, it can come with an
arbitrary time-stamp that we can use for querying purposes.</p>
<p>We can tolerate data arriving out of order, as we’re not completely
dependent on transaction-time.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="transaction"><a href="#transaction"></a>Transaction Time</h2>
<div>
<p>For audit reasons, we might wish to know with certainty the value of a
given entity-attribute at a given <code>tx-instant</code>. In this case, we want to
exclude the possibility of the valid past being amended, so we need a
pre-correction view of the data, relying on <code>tx-instant</code>.</p>
<p>To achieve this you can use <code>as-of</code> using <code>ts</code> (<code>valid-time</code>) and <code>tx-ts</code>
(<code>transaction-time</code>).</p>

</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="domain"><a href="#domain"></a>Domain Time</h2>
<div>
<p>Valid time is valuable for tracking a consistent view of the entire state of
the database, however, unless you explicitly include a timestamp or other
temporal component within your documents you cannot currently use this
information about valid time inside of your Datalog queries.</p>
<p>Domain time or "user-defined" time is simply the storing of any additional
time-related information within your documents, for instance <code>valid-time</code>,
<code>duration</code> or timestamps relating to additional temporal life-cycles (e.g.
decision, receipt, notification, availability).</p>
<p>Queries that use domain times do not automatically benefit from any
kind of native indexes to support efficient execution, however Crux
encourages you to build additional layers of functionality to do
so. See <a href="https://github.com/crux-labs/crux-decorators">decorators</a> for
examples.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="uses"><a href="#uses"></a>Known Uses</h2>
<div>
<p>Recording bitemporal information with your data is essential when dealing with
lag, corrections, and efficient auditability:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lag is found wherever there is risk of non-trivial delay until an event can
  be recorded. This is common between systems that communicate over unreliable
networks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Corrections are needed as errors are uncovered and as facts are reconciled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ad-hoc auditing is an otherwise intensive and slow process requiring
significant operational complexity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>With Crux you retain visibility of all historical changes whilst compensating
for lag, making corrections, and performing audit queries. By default, deleting
data only erases visibility of that data from the current perspective. You may
of course still evict data completely as the legal status of information
changes.</p>
<p>These capabilities are known to be useful for:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Event Sourcing (e.g.
  <a href="https://fr.slideshare.net/ThomasPierrain/as-time-goes-by-episode-2">retroactive
and scheduled events</a> and <a href="https://oparu.uni-ulm.de/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/4150/RetroactiveComputing_Mueller2016.pdf?sequence=5&amp;isAllowed=y">event-driven computing on evolving graphs</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ingesting out-of-order temporal data from upstream timestamping systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintaining a slowly changing dimension for decision support applications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recovering from accidental data changes and application errors (e.g. billing
systems)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auditing all data changes and performing data forensics when necessary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Responding to new compliance regulations and audit requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoiding the need to set up additional databases for historical data and
improving end-to-end data governance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building historical models that factor in all historical data (e.g. insurance
calculations)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accounting and financial calculations (e.g payroll systems)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Development, simulation and testing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Live migrations from legacy systems using ad-hoc batches of backfilled
temporal data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scheduling and previewing future states (e.g. publishing and content
management)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reconciling temporal data across eventually consistent systems</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Applied industry-specific examples include:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Legal Documentation – maintain visibility of all critical dates relating to
  legal documents, including what laws were known to be applicable at the time,
and any subsequent laws that may be relevant and applied retrospectively</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insurance Coverage – assess the level of coverage for a beneficiary across
the lifecycle of care and legislation changes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reconstruction of Trades – readily comply with evolving financial regulations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adverse Events in Healthcare – accurately record a patient’s records over
time and mitigate human error</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intelligence Gathering – build an accurate model of currently known
information to aid predictions and understanding of motives across time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Criminal Investigations – efficiently organise analysis and evidence whilst
enabling a simple retracing of investigative efforts</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div>
<h2 id="examples"><a href="#examples"></a>Example Queries</h2>
<div>
<div>
<h3 id="crime"><a href="#crime"></a>Crime Investigations</h3>
<p>This example is based on an academic paper.</p>

<p>During a criminal investigation it is critical to be able to refine a temporal
understanding of past events as new evidence is brought to light, errors in
documentation are accounted for, and speculation is corroborated. The paper
referenced above gives the following query example:</p>

<p>The paper then lists a sequence of entry and departure events at various United
States border checkpoints. We as the investigator will step through this
sequence to monitor a set of suspects. These events will arrive in an
undetermined chronological order based on how and when each checkpoint is able
to manually relay the information.</p>
<div>
<h4 id="_day_0"><a href="#_day_0"></a>Day 0</h4>
<p>Assuming Day 0 for the investigation period is <code>#inst "2018-12-31"</code>, the
initial documents are ingested using the Day 0 valid time:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="clj">  {:crux.db/id :p2
   :entry-pt :SFO
   :arrival-time #inst "2018-12-31"
   :departure-time :na}

  {:crux.db/id :p3
   :entry-pt :LA
   :arrival-time #inst "2018-12-31"
   :departure-time :na}
  #inst "2018-12-31"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The first document shows that <code>Person 2</code> was recorded entering via <code>:SFO</code> and
the second document shows that <code>Person 3</code> was recorded entering <code>:LA</code>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_day_1"><a href="#_day_1"></a>Day 1</h4>
<p>No new recorded events arrive on Day 1 (<code>#inst "2019-01-01"</code>), so there are no
documents available to ingest.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_day_2"><a href="#_day_2"></a>Day 2</h4>
<p>A single event arrives on Day 2 showing <code>Person 4</code> arriving at <code>:NY</code>:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="clj">  {:crux.db/id :p4
   :entry-pt :NY
   :arrival-time #inst "2019-01-02"
   :departure-time :na}
  #inst "2019-01-02"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_day_3"><a href="#_day_3"></a>Day 3</h4>
<p>Next, we learn on Day 3 that <code>Person 4</code> departed from <code>:NY</code>, which is
represented as an update to the existing document using the Day 3 valid time:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="clj">  {:crux.db/id :p4
   :entry-pt :NY
   :arrival-time #inst "2019-01-02"
   :departure-time #inst "2019-01-03"}
  #inst "2019-01-03"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_day_4"><a href="#_day_4"></a>Day 4</h4>
<p>On Day 4 we begin to receive events relating to the previous days of the
investigation.</p>
<p>First we receive an event showing that <code>Person 1</code> entered <code>:NY</code> on Day 0 which
must ingest using the Day 0 valid time <code>#inst "2018-12-31"</code>:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="clj">  {:crux.db/id :p1
   :entry-pt :NY
   :arrival-time #inst "2018-12-31"
   :departure-time :na}
  #inst "2018-12-31"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>We then receive an event showing that <code>Person 1</code> departed from <code>:NY</code> on Day 3,
so again we ingest this document using the corresponding Day 3 valid time:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="clj">  {:crux.db/id :p1
   :entry-pt :NY
   :arrival-time #inst "2018-12-31"
   :departure-time #inst "2019-01-03"}
  #inst "2019-01-03"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Finally, we receive two events relating to Day 4, which can be ingested using
the current valid time:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="clj">  {:crux.db/id :p1
   :entry-pt :LA
   :arrival-time #inst "2019-01-04"
   :departure-time :na}

  {:crux.db/id :p3
   :entry-pt :LA
   :arrival-time #inst "2018-12-31"
   :departure-time #inst "2019-01-04"}
  #inst "2019-01-04"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_day_5"><a href="#_day_5"></a>Day 5</h4>
<p>On Day 5 there is an event showing that <code>Person 2</code>, having arrived on Day 0
(which we already knew), departed from <code>:SFO</code> on Day 5.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="clj">  {:crux.db/id :p2
   :entry-pt :SFO
   :arrival-time #inst "2018-12-31"
   :departure-time #inst …</code></pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div>

<br/>
September 29, 2020 | https://www.kn8.lt/blog/building-privacy-focused-collaborative-software/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.kn8.lt/blog/building-privacy-focused-collaborative-software/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="reach-skip-nav"><div><p>I want to be able to build privacy focused applications that are as powerful and as user friendly as the “traditional” web apps we’re so used to today.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy focused</strong> means the application developers never get to see the content their users are creating - your data is yours only. <strong>Powerful</strong> means real-time collaboration between multiple users, search, notifications. <strong>User friendly</strong> means it’s easy to access or recover your data on a new device and easy to invite collaborators.</p>
<p>And that’s really hard today. Really really hard.</p>
<h2>Why do it?</h2>
<p>Why should we even care about building privacy focused applications? Why does privacy matter? Privacy might sometimes feel like a philosophical topic, but it’s one with very real life altering and threatening implications (including <a href="https://time.com/5290043/nazi-history-eu-data-privacy-gdpr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Holocaust</a>). I won’t be tackling this question in more depth here and if you want to learn more about the importance of privacy I recommend reading <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Identity-Reboot-Reimagining-Privacy-Century/dp/1916314414" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Identity Reboot: Reimagining Data Privacy for the 21st Century</a> by Arwen Smit.</p>
<p>“Privacy focused” can mean many things and is a really broad topic. This article looks specifically at collaborative content creation tools such as Google Docs and Slack - tools that individuals, teams and communities use to create private digital content. End-to-end encryption or removal of centralised servers could offer a technical solution to enhanced privacy in such applications. Public digital content creation like Wikipedia and Twitter, ambient content collection such as Amazon Alexa and Tesla car recordings and many other digital privacy issues are not considered in this article.</p>
<h2>Misaligned incentives</h2>
<p>Building collaborative content creation applications such as Google Docs, Asana or Slack, but in a way where all the content is end-to-end encrypted and only accessible to the content creators is technically very difficult. We will look at some of the technical challenges in more depth in the remainder of the article, but here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>added UX challenges of handling encryption keys</li>
<li>handling real-time collaborations on encrypted data</li>
<li>search over encrypted data is difficult to impossible</li>
<li>debugging, optimizing and supporting customers all become more difficult</li>
</ul>
<p>Technical overhead alone removes a lot of the incentive for any company to even try. What’s more, having access to the raw data provides companies with extra value. Data can be used to power features (e.g. Gmail’s smart compose) and data is what created today’s most profitable businesses by fuelling Ad targeting.</p>
<p>There’s also the fact that end-to-end encryption is not applicable to every type of application. E.g. building a web search engine, wikipedia or a social network does not require all of the content to be encrypted end-to-end. The fact that this problem is not universal further reduces the incentive to tackle it.</p>
<p>And so we have a chicken and egg problem, where lack of incentives means progress on technological solutions is slow, mostly being pushed forward by decentralisation hackers and academic researchers, while many of the world’s engineers are being paid to do the opposite - extracting more value from the data.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, end-to-end encryption tech could become more and more government regulated at any point. Perhaps anecdotal, but COVID-19 created an incentive to build a <a href="https://twitter.com/romy/status/1303852660320215042" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacy focused exposure notification system</a> (great!), but it’s also up to the governments to opt into it, and <a href="https://twitter.com/babynewt_/status/1304052101883064320" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not all of them are doing so</a>.</p>
<h2>Encryption trade offs</h2>
<p>To be clear, I’m not saying that encrypting all of the content is necessarily the best thing to do. Amassing data centrally can be of value not just to the companies, but to the users and society at large. While it might be possible to power a lot of innovative technology in a privacy focused manner, such as utilising on-device machine learning, it’s probably more efficient to develop say self driving cars if you can collect real video data from as many cars as possible.</p>
<p>And even if you’re not extracting value from data, storing unencrypted data is simpler and more efficient. It’s also more convenient for the users as the data is always backed up and easy to access from any device.</p>
<p>All that, coupled with the technical difficulty of creating end-to-end encrypted applications, it might well be the case that we will always have to lean on privacy policies, government regulations and put trust in companies when it comes to protecting our data.</p>
<h2>Privacy focused software landscape</h2>
<p>Nevertheless, high quality tools that are built in a privacy focused manner do exist. Perhaps most impressively - WhatsApp with its mass deployment of end-to-end encryption tech (Facebook ownership aside), as well as similar messaging apps, Signal and Wire. Then there’s ProtonMail providing the end-to-end encrypted email service. And 1Password, a cloud backed encrypted password manager.</p>
<p>Another, less known tool built on cutting edge tech is <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scuttlebutt</a> a fully decentralised (and fully functional) p2p social network. Scuttlebutt, which is similar to Twitter, does not utilise end-to-end encryption (for the social networking functionality), but it’s built in a way that means it works entirely without any servers (!). It’s completely p2p and it’s impressive that they made it work so well. BitTorrents are p2p and they work too, but that’s static file sharing, where Scuttlebutt is a living, breathing, dynamic social network with messages getting posted and propagated to the relevant peers all the time. I bring up Scuttlebutt, because as we see later it can inform the architecture of building privacy focused collaborative software.</p>
<p><em>Tangent: Speaking of privacy, election meddling and Scuttlebutt… Scuttlebutt can be viewed as an alternative to Facebook’s centralised approach. Facebook’s data is behind a login and access is monitored and limited (not always true as we’ve seen with the Cambridge Analytica). While Scuttlebutt’s data is completely open for anyone to mine, archive and analyse. But Scuttlebutt doesn’t have profit motives or server costs and so does not need to create targeted Ad tools or even algorithmic feeds that were used in election meddling. Which approach is better?</em></p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://bear.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bear</a> or <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Things</a> take a different privacy focused approach. Even though these apps do not encrypt the data, they store it in your private iCloud account, which means the app developers never get to see it. However, these apps do not offer collaboration. They are meant for single user only (with the exception of having to sync data across all of your devices, which they don’t always handle gracefully).</p>
<h2>Building a Google Docs alternative</h2>
<p>Is it possible then to build a multi user, collaborative, end-to-end encrypted, privacy focused Google Docs alternative? I picked Google Docs, because it’s so familiar and features what to this date remains to be such an impressive piece of tech – the real-time collaborative editing with shared cursors and comments. I don’t think anybody has done collaborative text editing better than Google Docs since it’s launch, at least not in such a widely used tool or in such a useful way.</p>
<p>To be able to answer if this is possible, let’s make a list of requirements.</p>
<h4>1. End-to-end encrypted</h4>
<p>Nobody, but the content creators get to see the content.</p>
<h4>2. Collaborative</h4>
<p>It should be as close as possible to the real-time collaborative editing experience of Google Docs – shared cursors and commenting. Not only that, but documents, entire collections of documents and application state, such as document tags and folder structures, should be easily shareable between multiple people.</p>
<h4>3. Easy sharing</h4>
<p>Sharing a document, a collection of documents, or inviting other people into your workspace should be easy enough so that anyone can do it (e.g. invite by email address as opposed to copying and pasting public keys).</p>
<h4>4. Search</h4>
<p>I should be able to search through all of the documents I have access to.</p>
<h4>5. Offline capable</h4>
<p>I’d like to be able to access and edit documents offline, without internet connection and sync later. Including any text edits and comment interactions.</p>
<h4>6. Backups</h4>
<p>If you drop your phone in the mud with all the documents, you can restore them from an encrypted cloud backup.</p>
<h4>7. High availability</h4>
<p>If I make changes to a document on my phone, those changes should propagate to other collaborators reliably and quickly even if they were offline at the time of me typing those changes. That is, collaborators don’t have to be online at the same time to sync their changes. Similarly, if you invite a new member to your workspace with some documents shared, they should be able to retrieve and decrypt those documents without any other collaborator being online.</p>
<h4>8. Stretch goal: p2p mode</h4>
<p>Ideally, the software, accepting some limitations (i.e. no high availability), should be able to work completely peer to peer. That is you should be able to opt out of any server participation and still be able to use the application in full even if the service provider shuts down, a longevity oriented approach.</p>
<p>Not all of the above requirements are strictly necessary for building privacy focused software, but they do interconnect in unexpected ways. For example, since search can not be done server side on the encrypted data, that implies having to store all the data on the client, making offline capability a useful side effect. In addition to privacy, these requirements try to incorporate longevity, data ownership and other ideas of <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Local-first software</a>.</p>
<h2>Possible approaches</h2>
<p>I can think of at least three distinctly different approaches to building an application like this. Let’s see how each of the approaches holds against our requirements.</p>
<h4>Traditional server/client web app</h4>
<p>You can most definitely create Google Docs as a web app (it is already a web app, duh). But once you add the data privacy or end-to-end encryption requirement, that’s when things get tricky.</p>
<p>For starters, powering a feature like Search becomes nearly impossible with encrypted content on the server. To be able to …</p></div></div></div>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong></p>
<p>The following represent my opinions, not that of the C++ committee (WG21), any of its members or any other person mentioned in this article.</p>
<hr>
<p>I think the most fundamental work done by WG21 is trying to answer meta-questions about itself.
What is C++, what is its essence, what should we focus on? How to evolve a language with a growing community,
a growing committee?
A language that is deployed on billions of devices, with an estimated 50 billions actively maintained lines of code.
During a CppCon panel last week I was asked about stability VS evolution. This is a hot topic,
one that may never stop being on people’s mind.</p>
<p>There are a lot of interesting meta-questions worth asking about the standard library too.
A question that comes over and over again, is what does it mean to deprecate something, why and when.
Another is what to put in there to begin with.</p>
<p>I wrote a few times on the subject <a href="https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/what_should_go_in_stl/">before</a>,
hopefully, I will be self-consistent. Not promising anything!</p>
<p>Bryce Adelstein Lelbach, then chair of LEWGI coined the phrase</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Knowing that our resources are scarce and our time is limited, do we want to give more time to this proposal?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has become somewhat of a meme in the committee.
Since then, we shipped C++20, Bryce became chair of LEWG (which is a super difficult job that he does brilliantly),
and oh. There is this pandemic you might have heard about.</p>
<p>Never have the scarcity of our resources and the limitedness of our time be more apparent.</p>
<p>We try to make the best of the situation, but I think it’s fair to say that WG21’s output is
reduced. And frankly, we cannot ask of anyone to prioritize C++ standardization with all that’s going on right now.
But even at the best of times, C++ library design is a costly, lengthy process involving a lot of people.
Which is good, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law">Linus’s law</a>, plays a huge role in the quality of the standard library.</p>
<p>I don’t know that this used to be a question anyone asked. For a very long time, there were few enough proposals
that they virtually could accept all of those they liked.
At the beginning of the committee, there even was a single pipeline for both language and library.
We can argue whether the separation of rooms we have today is always sensible.
Most of the time library features can be added without new language proposal, but at the same time ADL, customization points,
overload sets etc have been growing pain point for the library, and no organization can escape Conway’s law.</p>
<p>Anyway, the influx of new proposal has grown enough in the past few years that LEWG has now the luxury
and the burden to chose which direction to go in and how to use its far too limited time.</p>
<h2 id="standardization-is-expensive">Standardization is expensive</h2>
<p>I think the life cycle of a library feature goes a bit like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone floats an idea and write a paper</li>
<li>The paper is matured over 1-10 years</li>
<li>There is some latency for implementations (6 months - 5 years) - at least 3 or 4 implementations</li>
<li>There is a ton of latency in deploying toolchains where people can use them (this might be a story for another day)</li>
<li>There is a literal ton of people writing blog posts / textbooks / conference talks about that one feature</li>
<li>Then there is a slow adoption and debate about whether adopting the feature is good or not</li>
</ul>
<p>And every step is resources constrained. Deprecation and removal is also very slow.
People are still using components that were deprecated 10, 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Critical flight software at NASA is estimated at 1000$ per line.
I wouldn’t be surprised if the standard library costs more.
And so, one of the way to answer
“Should that piece of code be in the standard” can maybe be reformulated as “Would this benefit from the standardization process?”</p>
<p>Fundamentally, that makes the standard library a bad package manager.
If the only motivation for something to be in the standard is to palliate to the lack of good package managers,
then it’s probably not a good motivation.
(Especially as the standard library is super bad at availability. it will be years until <code>&lt;ranges&gt;</code> is everywhere.)</p>
<p>Of course, that argument falls flat if you consider <code>std::vector</code>. It doesn’t <em>need</em> to be there, but we are all sure glad it is.
So there is an <em>universality</em> argument to be made too.
If something is universally useful (for example, 90% of programs would use it), then it starts to be a very compelling
feature for the standard library.</p>
<p>Some features can’t live anywhere but in the STL:</p>
<p>Type traits, and everything that needs or benefits from compiler magic and intrinsics.
<a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/support.srcloc">source_location</a>, <a href="https://wg21.link/p0881r6">std::stacktrace</a>, <a href="https://wg21.link/p1885r2">encoding detection</a>,
Reflection support library and other introspection capabilities, <a href="https://wg21.link/p0627r3">std::unreachable</a>, <a href="https://wg21.link/p1773r0">std::assume</a>,
<a href="https://wg21.link/p1040r6">std::embed</a>.
All of these are magic and rely on the compiler. In other words they cannot be implemented portably outside of the standard library.
These are necessary for communicating between user code and compiler, and are the basis of higher-level components.
A logger would use <code>std::source_location</code> for example.</p>
<p>This is especially true of reflection: until C++ gets reflection, an entire class of program cannot be written.
Pattern matching make it possible to write cleaner code. Reflection make it possible to write… code.
Code that you cannot otherwise emulate in standard C++, regardless how much you try.
And that can be pretty expensive across the industry.</p>
<p>So library components that make new things possible are high on the list of the things I think should go in the standard library.</p>
<p>Then, even more obvious, come amelioration to what’s already there.
As standard types get deployed, the committee has to improve them. Both in response to usage experience and to increase synergy between types
or add obvious features that were missing, bug fix, support for new language features.
As such, this <a href="https://wg21.link/p1679r3">std::string::contains</a> proposal might not be the most exciting that will land in 23,
but it might be one of the most useful for many people.</p>
<p>This is the rationale for my own  <a href="https://wg21.link/p2019r0">thread name proposal</a>.
It is not possible to name threads created by <code>std::thread</code>,
and people who rely on that (for ex. the game industry) need to write an entire thread class to replace <code>std::thread</code>, just for this extra piece of functionality.
Other people might give a name to their threads if it’s easy, but might not bother if it implies reimplementing <code>std::thread</code> themselves.
The cost/benefit of using a feature decreases if that feature is present in the standard library. But that is mostly true for small quality-of-life features,
not larger features that are application critical.</p>
<p>There are also vocabulary types: types that are designed to be the glue between libraries, a universal language for interface boundaries.
These get used everywhere. We spend a lot of time getting them right because of this by-design pervasiveness. <code>std::span</code> might simultaneously
be the simplest type of C++20 and also the one that took the most work getting right.
One example of glaringly missing vocabulary type is <a href="https://wg21.link/p1059r0"><code>std::expected</code></a>:
A type that is a bit stuck in another super important meta-conversation: What are the error handlings mechanism that should be used and promoted in C++?
We still have to answer that question.</p>
<p>But… I am not sure types are the right kind of entities at interfaces boundary.
Concepts make for a better vocabulary because they prescribe interfaces, not implementations. (<code>span</code> is nothing if not ““template erasure”” over any <code>contiguous_range</code>).
So maybe the standard library should mainly provide concepts to tie all 3rd parties together? The <code>&lt;concept&gt;</code> header is a good start here.</p>
<p>There is however an issue with just trying to add concepts in the standard.
Concepts are informed by concrete types and how they are used, they cannot be pulled out of thin air. Not without making mistakes anyway, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_yzLe-wnfk">concepts are not amendable to mistakes</a>.</p>
<p>So, it would seem that if the STL is to have concepts, it need algorithms.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Generic Programming pro tip: Although Concepts are constraints on types, you don't find them by looking at the types in your system. You find them by studying the algorithms.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cpp?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#cpp</a></p>— Eric Niebler (@ericniebler) <a href="https://twitter.com/ericniebler/status/990390059579789312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2018</a></blockquote>


<p>Good algorithms are agnostic of domain-specific knowledge and can be used in the widest variety of situations.
Algorithms are not useful to people who write games, or people who make microcontrollers, they are useful to people who write C++.
I’d write better code if I was able to recognise more algorithms.</p>
<p>A focus of C++20 was concepts and ranges, and I hope this remains the case in future versions of C++. views in particular are one of these things people might not actively looked for if available by default.
I sure think <code>views::product</code> is more maintainable than nested loops, but I might not try to find a library that has it, if it’s not in the standard.</p>
<p>So, magic types, vocabulary types, concepts and improvements of existing facilities. A good list of what might be LEWG priorities.</p>
<p>But what about networking, Unicode, processes, 15D graphics, audio, a web engine, ML facilities, JSON parsing, crypto, blockchains, Http, event handling, regexes that don’t suck, etc?</p>
<p>These sure make a great front page cover.
But here is the thing:</p>
<p>WG21 is… kinda bad at design?
Not because we are inherently inept, but because library design is fundamentally hard.
And what we understand to be good library design is a somewhat fast-moving target.</p>
<p>The STL is the foundation of the entire C++ ecosystem. And often used to demonstrate how to use new features and write good code. And we try to cover as many use cases as possible.
Design is finding a path in the maze of the design space, and at each crossing, we go in the direction that we think is the most widely useful.
Problem is, the numbers of crossings grows exponentially with the number of abstraction layers or the complexity of the domain.
It soon becomes impossible to please everybody, or even a majority of people.</p>
<p><code>vector</code> has a few knobs: allocation strategies, growth strategies, error handling etc. It’s a manageable number of knobs that we can tweak …</p></div></div>

  <p>PostgreSQL database queries are a common performance bottleneck for web apps. Before you resort to more complex optimization techniques like caching or read replicas, you should double-check if your database engine is correctly tuned and queries are not underperforming.</p>

<p>PG Extras is a tool that allows you to spot common PostgreSQL pitfalls. <a href="https://github.com/pawurb/ruby-pg-extras" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pawurb/rails-pg-extras" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rails</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pawurb/ecto_psql_extras" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Elixir</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/pawurb/node-postgres-extras" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NodeJS</a> implementations are currently available.</p>

<p>In this blog post, I present a step by step guide on using PG Extras library to spot and resolve common PostgreSQL database performance issues.</p>



<p>Please refer to READMEs of respective implementations for installation details.  API is almost identical for all the versions. Let’s compare the invocation of the <code>cache_hit</code> method:</p>

<p><code>Ruby</code></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>RubyPGExtras</span><span>.</span><span>cache_hit</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><code>Rails</code></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>RailsPGExtras</span><span>.</span><span>cache_hit</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><code>Elixir</code></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>EctoPSQLExtras</span><span>.</span><span>query</span><span>(</span><span>:cache_hit</span><span>,</span> <span>YourApp</span><span>.</span><span>Repo</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><code>NodeJS</code></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>PostgresExtras</span><span>.</span><span>cache_hit</span><span>()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In this blog post, I’ll be using examples from the pure Ruby version.</p>

<h3 id="enable-pg_stat_statements-extension">Enable <code>pg_stat_statements</code> extension</h3>

<p>Some of the PG Extras methods depend on the <code>pg_stat_statements</code> extension. If you are using a default Heroku PostgreSQL plugin or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AWS RDS</a>, you should be good to go without making any changes.</p>

<p>To check if the extension is already enabled you can use PG Extras itself:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>RubyPGExtras</span><span>.</span><span>extensions</span>

<span>...</span>
<span>|</span> <span>pg_stat_statements</span> <span>|</span> <span>1.7</span> <span>|</span> <span>1.7</span> <span>|</span> <span>track</span> <span>execution</span> <span>statistics</span> <span>of</span> <span>all</span> <span>SQL</span> <span>statements</span> <span>executed</span>
<span>...</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If <code>pg_stat_statements</code> is not listed you should check out <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html" target="_blank">these docs</a> for info on installing it.</p>

<p>Now that you’ve set up the library in the language of your choice let’s start checking our database’s health.</p>

<p><strong>[Important]</strong> <em>Make certain to run all the checks on a warmed up production database. Under the hood, PG Extras performs a lightweight queries on PostgreSQL metadata tables. It will not impact your production workload.</em></p>

<h2 id="1-validate-your-database-specs-with-cache-hit-ratios">1) Validate your database specs with cache hit ratios</h2>

<p>In theory, the simplest solution to optimize the underperforming database is to scale it up vertically. Before you start throwing money at your performance issues, it’s good to check if it will actually help.</p>

<p>PostgreSQL tracks access patterns of your data and keeps frequently read chunks in a memory cache. A reliable indicator that a database should be scaled up is an invalid cache hit ratio.</p>

<p>You can check index and table cache hit ratios using the following code:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>RubyPGExtras</span><span>.</span><span>cache_hit</span>

      <span>name</span>      <span>|</span>         <span>ratio</span>
<span>----------------+------------------------</span>
 <span>index</span> <span>hit</span> <span>rate</span> <span>|</span>        <span>0.999577</span>
 <span>table</span> <span>hit</span> <span>rate</span> <span>|</span>        <span>0.988721</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you want to drill down into each individual’s table and index cache hit ratios, you can use <code>table_cache_hit</code> and <code>index_cache_hit</code> methods.</p>

<p>The rule of the thumb is that values should be above 99%. If your database cache hit ratios are lower, it’s either not correctly configured or should be scaled up to increase the performance.</p>

<p>Heroku PostgreSQL ships with already optimized settings and does not allow you to change them. If you see low cache hit ratios, your best bet is to provision a more powerful database instance.</p>

<p>Amazon RDS is notorious for shipping the database instances with incorrect default settings. If you’re using it, make sure to tweak them before deciding to scale up the instance. <a href="https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PGTune</a> is the best tool to help you tweak the most important Postgres buttons and dials to the correct values.</p>

<h2 id="2-remove-unused-indexes">2) Remove unused indexes</h2>

<p>Overusing indexes is a recipe for a sluggish web app.</p>

<p>The more indexes you add, the more write operations have to be performed on each data update. Misconfigured indexes also tend to unecessarily bloat the size of a database, slowing down the backup/restore/upgrade operations.</p>

<p>It’s entirely possible that some of your indexes and not used and can be safely removed.</p>

<p>PG Extras <code>unused_indexes</code> method can help you spot them:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>RubyPGExtras</span><span>.</span><span>unused_indexes</span>

          <span>table</span>      <span>|</span>                       <span>index</span>                <span>|</span> <span>index_size</span> <span>|</span> <span>index_scans</span>
<span>---------------------+--------------------------------------------+------------+-------------</span>
 <span>public</span><span>.</span><span>grade_levels</span> <span>|</span> <span>index_placement_attempts_on_grade_level_id</span> <span>|</span> <span>97</span> <span>MB</span>      <span>|</span>           <span>0</span>
 <span>public</span><span>.</span><span>observations</span> <span>|</span> <span>observations_attrs_grade_resources</span>         <span>|</span> <span>33</span> <span>MB</span>      <span>|</span>           <span>0</span>
 <span>public</span><span>.</span><span>messages</span>     <span>|</span> <span>user_resource_id_idx</span>                       <span>|</span> <span>12</span> <span>MB</span>      <span>|</span>           <span>0</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Few <code>index_scans</code> on an index that has been around for a while means that it should be removed. If the index is large, remember to use the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-dropindex.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>CONCURRENTLY</code></a> option when dropping it, to avoid exclusively blocking the whole related table.</p>

<p><code>index_size</code> method can give you a quick overview of how much space your database indexes are taking:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>RubyPGExtras</span><span>.</span><span>index_size</span>

     <span>name</span>            <span>|</span>  <span>size</span>
<span>-----------------------------------------------</span>
 <span>index_a_name</span>        <span>|</span> <span>5196</span> <span>MB</span>
 <span>index_b_name</span>        <span>|</span> <span>4045</span> <span>MB</span>
 <span>index_b_name</span>        <span>|</span> <span>2611</span> <span>MB</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="3-add-missing-indexes">3) Add missing indexes</h2>

<p>Now that we’ve removed unused indexes, let’s add some new ones. We don’t want them to share the fate of their recently deprovisioned cousins. Let’s look at PG Extras <code>seq_scans</code> and <code>calls</code> methods before deciding on what should be indexed.</p>

<p>A <em>sequential scan</em> is an action that Postgres performs if it cannot find an index necessary to fulfill the query condition. For the following query:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>USERS</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>AGE</span> <span>=</span> <span>18</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>the related <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code> query output will show <code>Seq scan on users Filter: AGE = 18</code> or <code>Index Scan using users_age_index Index Cond: AGE = 18</code> depending on whether the index on <code>age</code> column is present or not.</p>

<p><code>seq_scans</code> method displays the number of <code>Seq Scan</code> operations for each table:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>RubyPGExtras</span><span>.</span><span>seq_scans</span>

               <span>name</span>                <span>|</span>  <span>count</span>
<span>-----------------------------------+----------</span>
 <span>learning_coaches</span>                  <span>|</span> <span>44820063</span>
 <span>states</span>                            <span>|</span> <span>36794975</span>
 <span>grade_levels</span>                      <span>|</span> <span>13972293</span>
 <span>charities_customers</span>               <span>|</span>  <span>8615277</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now that we know which tables are often read inefficiently, we can use <code>calls</code> and <code>outliers</code> methods to list the most often executed and most time-consuming queries.</p>

<p>Both of those methods let you extract the raw query string. You can use it to perform <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code> and check if the query planner does <code>Seq scan</code> on one of the tables.</p>

<p>By correlating all those sources of data, you should be able to spot queries that are consuming a lot of your database resources and are potentially missing an index.</p>

<p>Watch out to avoid premature optimization by adding unnecessary indexes. PostgreSQL will often fallback to <code>Seq Scan</code> instead of <code>Index Scan</code> on small tables, for which using the index would be less efficient than reading the whole table row by row.</p>

<h2 id="4-identify-deadlocks">4) Identify deadlocks</h2>

<p>PostgreSQL uses locks to ensure data consistency in multithreaded environments. There are different kinds of locks, but we’ll focus on <code>ExclusiveLock</code> and <code>RowExclusiveLock</code>. A healthy web app should never lock for more than a couple of hundred of miliseconds.</p>

<p>Deadlock is two more or database locks blocking each other and not able to continue execution. An implementation error that results in a deadlock might have disastrous consequences for your application. The queue of requests not able to proceed could start piling up and eventually crash your servers.</p>

<p>Common reasons for deadlocks and locks that are granted for too long:</p>

<ul>
  <li>too broad database transaction scope</li>
  <li>adding or removing index without using the <code>CONCURRENTLY</code> option</li>
  <li>updating lots of rows at once</li>
  <li>adding a new column with the default value (before PostgreSQL 12)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-detect-locks-and-deadlocks">How to detect locks and deadlocks</h3>

<p>You can use <code>locks</code> method to see all the currently obtained locks together with the source query:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>RubyPGExtras</span><span>.</span><span>locks</span>

 <span>procpid</span> <span>|</span> <span>relname</span> <span>|</span> <span>transactionid</span> <span>|</span> <span>granted</span> <span>|</span>     <span>query_snippet</span>     <span>|</span> <span>mode</span>             <span>|</span>       <span>age</span>

<p>The mere presence of locks does not mean that something is wrong with your database. Only locks that are granted for too long are potentially problematic. You can use the following Ruby snippet integrated into the background job to alert you if this happens:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>TRESHOLD_SECONDS</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>

<span>long_locks</span> <span>=</span> <span>RubyPGExtras</span><span>.</span><span>locks</span><span>(</span><span>in_format: :hash</span><span>).</span><span>select</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>lock</span><span>|</span>

<span>end</span>

<span>raise</span> <span>"Long running locks: </span><span>#{</span><span>long_locks</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>if</span> <span>long_locks</span><span>.</span><span>present?</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you notice extended locks, you can use the <code>blocking</code> method to check which SQL statements cannot continue execution because of a lock:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>RubyPGExtras</span><span>.</span><span>blocking</span>

 <span>blocked_pid</span> <span>|</span>    <span>blocking_statement</span>    <span>|</span> <span>blocking_duration</span> <span>|</span> <span>blocking_pid</span> <span>|</span>                                        <span>blocked_statement</span>                           <span>|</span> <span>blocked_duration</span>
<span>-------------+--------------------------+-------------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------</span>

<p>If your app is crashing because of deadlocks, you can use the <code>kill_all</code> to terminate all the database processes before you manage to resolve the underlying cause.</p>

<h2 id="5-get-rid-of-unnecessary-bloat">5) Get rid of unnecessary bloat</h2>

<p>The way PostgreSQL works is that it never updates or removes the data in place but instead marks each row as visible or not for transactions using two meta columns <code>xmin</code> and <code>xmax</code>. Rows no longer visible for any of the currently active transactions are called <em>dead rows</em> or <em>bloat</em>.</p>

<p>Dead rows are regularly <em>garbage collected</em> by a process called <em>AUTOVACUUM</em>, …</p></article></div>

<p name="2ab1"><strong>The above photo is from the </strong><a href="https://weconomics.org/events/congres2019/congresprogramma/" data-href="https://weconomics.org/events/congres2019/congresprogramma/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Weconomics convention</strong></a><strong> last year, where I had the opportunity to pre-present my book </strong><a href="https://lifebeyond.one/" data-href="https://lifebeyond.one/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Life Beyond the Touch Screen</strong></a><strong> before its official launch in 2020. Something really interesting happened during my session.</strong></p>
<p name="da59">I never presented my book as much as I simply told a story about my personal experience with technology and mental health.&nbsp;</p>
<p name="f245">In my presentation and workshop I mostly just shared the story about <a href="https://lifebeyond.one/blogs/tech-impact/smartphone-addiction-burnout-and-balance?_pos=2&amp;_sid=0e6e4570f&amp;_ss=r" data-href="https://lifebeyond.one/blogs/tech-impact/smartphone-addiction-burnout-and-balance?_pos=2&amp;_sid=0e6e4570f&amp;_ss=r" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my own experience with digital dependency and with burnout</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p name="5820">In that story I recount how for about two years I was simply asking far too much from myself; my body and my brain. And how looking back, I could easily retrace the steps that led to my inevitable collapse, more or less.</p>
<p name="f412">The fun part is that — though I do mention here and there that <a href="https://lifebeyond.one/blogs/tech-impact/smartphone-addiction-technology-dependency-science-and-statistics?_pos=1&amp;_sid=76458b6a6&amp;_ss=r" data-href="https://lifebeyond.one/blogs/tech-impact/smartphone-addiction-technology-dependency-science-and-statistics?_pos=1&amp;_sid=76458b6a6&amp;_ss=r" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study after study is showing the possible heinous effects overuse of digital technology</a> can and probably does have on our mental health — </p>
<blockquote name="302e">Digital technology is not the root cause in my story.</blockquote>
<h4 name="dbf8">Digital tech is your black&nbsp;mirror</h4>
<p name="a727">Digital technology, in my personal experience, is simply a (black) mirror that shows us what we’re <em>actually</em> giving our focus and attention to — as compared to what we <em>think</em> our priorities and values are. If we let it, it can show us what’s really going on under the surface.</p>
<p name="2187">My talk at the Weconomics convention was by far the best received ‘performance’ I have ever given. The reactions from listeners were easily 10x those of my greatest and best performances in my time as a musician.</p>
<p name="969a">I think it had to do with relevance, vulnerability and authenticity.</p>
<p name="753a">But there was something else that absolutely stood out to me as well.</p>
<h4 name="c19b">When do things start to matter to&nbsp;humans?</h4>
<p name="e8ee">I saw faces in the crowd change, and I noticed the tone of the discussion become much, much more serious when we started talking about the impacts of tech on our younger generations. Our kids.</p>
<blockquote name="530f">What if our children are already, inevitably headed to digitally-induced mental health disaster, and there’s not much we can do now to stop the train?</blockquote>
<p name="7f01">Touching as it may have felt, it also had me worried. Why can we suddenly see how serious something can really be impacting our focus, energy, creativity, productivity — generally; our growth and wellbeing — when it’s about our children? Why can’t we see that when it’s about <em>ourselves</em>?</p>
<p name="e05c">You want my blunt, honest opinion? I think it’s a combination of an underdeveloped capacity to seriously self-reflect as human adults, with an underdeveloped degree of self-love.&nbsp;</p>
<p name="3499">And the funny thing is: if we want a better world and a better future for our children — it starts exactly there: with ourselves, our self-love and self-awareness.&nbsp;</p>
<p name="ff4e">Namasté, peoples.</p>

    <p>Sometimes I do fork repositories and do some tweaks here and there for my personal needs which ain’t
really going to be merged into the upstream repository.</p>
<p>One thing that used to concern me is that I needed to manually rebase my changes onto the upstream
to have new goods but keep my changes on top of them.</p>
<p>Fortunately, GitHub Actions supports the <code>schedule</code> trigger for workflows and this is what we are
going to use.</p>
<p>The CI plan is simple and straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tigger by a schedule or by a manual run.</li>
<li>Fetch &amp; checkout repository.</li>
<li>Specify an upstream Git URL. Unfortunately, GitHub doesn’t expose an environment variable of a
upstream repository (or I didn’t find it).</li>
<li>Rebase onto upstream.</li>
<li>Push changes.</li>
</ul>

an additional push. Go to Actions, find Rebase workflow and click on the Run workflow button.</p>
<p>That’s it, really. If the rebase fails, GitHub will send you an email letting you know about it.</p>

Our favorite orange website isn’t leading by example, either. Some comments are almost unreadable:</p><figure><picture><img src="https://darekkay.com/blog/accessible-color-palette/hacker-news.png" srcset="https://darekkay.com/blog/accessible-color-palette/hacker-news.png, https://darekkay.com/blog/accessible-color-palette/hacker-news-2x.png 2x" alt="Insufficient contrast ratio on Hacker News"></picture><figcaption>Insufficient contrast ratio on Hacker News</figcaption></figure><p>There are various tools that help us <em>identify</em> and <em>fix</em> contrast ratio issues on our websites.

The <em>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</em> (WCAG) <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G18.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">define</a> minimum required contrast ratios, based on colors, text properties (size, boldness) and conformance levels (AA vs. AAA):</p><figure><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Level AA</th><th>Level AAA</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>small text</strong></td><td>4.5+</td><td>7+</td></tr><tr><td><strong>large text</strong></td><td>3+</td><td>4.5+</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Minimum required contrast ratio values</figcaption></figure><p>Note: <em>large text</em> is defined as <em>19px+ bold</em> or <em>24px+ normal</em>.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, try to go for a <strong>4.5:1</strong> minimum contrast ratio, which will pass <strong>WCAG AA</strong> independent of the text size. This provides a good cost-value trade-off and is often the legal accessibility requirement.</p><p>Calculating the accessibility conformance manually is tedious. Instead, I suggest using a tool like <a href="https://contrast-ratio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contrast-ratio.com</a>. DevTools in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Accessibility_inspector#Color_contrast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firefox</a> and <a href="https://umaar.com/dev-tips/236-accessible-colour-suggestions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrome</a> provide great built-in browser support. Finally, <a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-cli" target="_blank" rel="noopener">axe-core</a> will scan a website for all kinds of accessibility violations.</p><p>Those tools are a great way to find contrast ratio issues, but let me describe a technique to prevent them in the first place.</p><h2 id="Magic-numbers"><a href="#Magic-numbers" title="Magic numbers"></a>Magic numbers</h2><p>Most color palettes divide their colors into grades (e.g. <code>pink-10</code> … <code>pink-90</code>).</p><p>Let’s define a <em>difference between two color grades</em> as <strong>magic number</strong>, e.g.:</p><ul><li>Colors: <code>blue-80</code> and <code>orange-30</code></li><li>Magic number: <code>80 - 30</code> = <code>50</code></li></ul><p>What if we could find a magic number for the whole palette that ensures a sufficient color contrast between two colors? The first time I’ve heard about this concept was in a <a href="https://pspeter3.com/blog/2020/02/19/accessible-contrast-shades/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> from Phips Peter. I’ve learned about the <a href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-tokens/color/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Web Design System</a> and was immediately hooked. The color system provides the following magic numbers:</p><ul><li>A magic number of <strong>40+</strong> ensures a contrast ratio of <strong>3+</strong></li><li>A magic number of <strong>50+</strong> ensures a contrast ratio of <strong>4.5+</strong></li><li>A magic number of <strong>70+</strong> ensures a contrast ratio of <strong>7+</strong></li></ul><p>By looking at the color names, I know that <code>red-40</code> and <code>gray-90</code> (= <code>50</code>) will definitely pass <em>WCAG AA</em> (required contrast ratio <code>4.5+</code>), while <code>red-60</code> and <code>gray-90</code> (= <code>30</code>) will not. This leads to a <em>fantastic</em> designer/developer experience. I don’t have to use a contrast checker or look anything up to ensure a sufficient contrast ratio. A difference of 50 or more is all I care about.</p><h2 id="Calculating-magic-numbers-for-an-existing-color-palette"><a href="#Calculating-magic-numbers-for-an-existing-color-palette" title="Calculating magic numbers for an existing color palette"></a>Calculating magic numbers for an existing color palette</h2><p>Some libraries define their magic numbers in the documentation, but what about others?</p><p>I have written <a href="https://github.com/darekkay/a11y-contrast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a11y-contrast</a> to calculate the magic numbers for any color palette that follows a grade naming pattern (e.g. <code>red-20</code>). This tool also finds all violations for any given magic number.

  <p>⚠️ This article is extreme &amp; satirical on the purpose of being thought-provoking. Therefore, please, do take it with some grain of salt.</p>

  <p>This is a followup of my <a href="https://blog.pwkf.org/2020/09/26/remote-working-is-a-paradigm-shift.html">Remote-mostly working is a paradigm shift</a>.</p>

<p>My #1 advice about distributed teams is actually even the case in colocated teams:
<strong>Try as hard as possible to avoid meetings, use textual IM instead</strong> as <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/meetings-where-work-goes-to-die/">meetings are where work goes to die</a>.
I know it sounds pretty dull, but if you really think about it you’ll see that it’s usually wasted time.
The usual pattern of decision taking is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1. if you don’t have a clue, ask someone else.
2. to ask him, schedule a meeting
3. to schedule a meeting, you have to find a slot
4. that usually postpones the decision
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Postponing the decision is usually what one really wants, even unknowingly: “<em>to be able to have an excuse not to decide at once</em>”.</p>

<p>It’s a very very fair humane reaction, I also fell myself into that trap.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.pwkf.org/assets/images/out-of-window.jpg" alt="Thrown out of the fence for proposing an textual chat"></p>



<p>I end up having the following workflow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Avoid email loops. Those have too much overhead, and will divide your audience pretty quickly.</li>
  <li>Create a slack channel instead of the email loop. This will retain the whole conversation in 1 central place.</li>
  <li>Systematically push back on any meetings. Accept them only if you have a clear statement of who will drive it.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Meetings should be a broadcast mode. All the Q&amp;A should go back to the slack channel.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Having everything searchable makes it super easy for
        <ul>
          <li>newcomers that can simply scroll back</li>
          <li>old timers such as me that forget and can also simply scroll back</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Even recorded meetings are a vast of time if you need to find an information, as it’s not indexed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>If not recorded, sending the minutes afterwards are usually a loss of information.
        <ul>
          <li>It’s still very important to extract “executive summaries” from those meetings, even only textual. As can be posted on a public place for massive &amp; broad sharing.</li>
          <li>Yet, the real context on those summaries will be kept inside the whole meeting</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Context effectively fights Cargo Cult</strong></p>

  <p>Usually the why of decisions are not provided in a “<a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/120739/a-peek-into-the-sausage-factory">build the sausage</a>” manner. But after a while, the hypothesis of the decision are not true anymore, and therefore another decision has to be taken.</p>

  <p>This is not possible when loss of information occurs and that’s when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming">Cargo cult</a> begins to creep in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a record-everything scenario, context switch is just a matter of reading back some previous messages. Otherwise you’ll spend numerous times “explaining the context” in a meeting to everyone. And then everyone will just move to something else, and you’ll have pitiful engagement, while still spending time on it.</p>

<p><strong>A company that use its time effectively, is a company that moves much faster than its competitors</strong>, no matter the skillsets in that company. Even if you have the brightest minds, if you waste their talents in boring activities, you’ll dry them up. And either they’ll leave, or worse, they <a href="https://www.sbnonline.com/article/the-quit-and-stay-syndrome-a-business-epidemic-thats-a-silent-profit-killer/">quit &amp; stay</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>💡 This enabled me to scale to a reasonable multitasking ability while curbing its overhead to a manageable level</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>That’s why “startups” are so effective</strong> : they are small and therefore very fast. Being fast brings capacity to try &amp; fail, and therefore agility.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>💡 <strong>time is the only really scarse resource in a company</strong> : you can’t buy it back, no matter the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="why-you-should-only-have-fun-ones">Why you should only have fun ones</h2>

<p>That said, I do agree that travelling is necessary. But we should name the real usecase of travelling : having <em>fun</em> <strong>together</strong>.</p>

<p>The nicest part of that purpose is :</p>

<ul>
  <li>you can plan it far in advance</li>
  <li>you can also budget it in advance</li>
  <li>you can mentally map yourself in those fun times, and focus on actual work right now.</li>
</ul>



<p>The most used reason for meetings is “alignments”, but it is very usually wasted as :</p>

<ul>
  <li>There’s always someone missing for that meeting</li>
  <li>No-one really wants to write the minutes out of it</li>
  <li>If written nonetheless, those minutes are only seldom capturing the <em>why</em> the decision is reached. Which is the most important part!</li>
</ul>

<p>The “<em>there’s always someone missing from that meeting</em>” is the worst part, as usually, that is the one that says “what you decided cannot be done”. And you’ll end up with yet another round of thinking at best. At worst you’ll try to shoehorn your precious alignment (that did sink a huge travel budget) into the needs of that missing person.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>💡 We can draw a parallel to the paradigm shift I mentioned earlier:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>F2F</strong> Meetings are the <strong>monolith</strong> way.</li>
  <li>Informal, dedicated &amp; <strong>textual meetings</strong> are the <strong>micro-services</strong> way.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, one immediately notices the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>People are very much at ease with monoliths</strong>. It takes a huge mental leap to go micro-services.</li>
  <li><strong>Micro-services have an overhead</strong>. But no-one will argue that they can scale way better.</li>
  <li>Monoliths can seldomly be distributed the way micro-services can : you’ll quickly end up with that infamous distributed monolith pattern.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>💡 Now, let’s travel only for “team building” purposes.</p>

  <p>You can plan them in advance, and you won’t have over-budget ones. As their outcome is predictable, and if there’s someone missing, it won’t jeopardy the whole travelling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A final word of caution, the reference to scaling is <strong>not about runtime performance</strong>. It’s more about <strong>organisation size</strong>. As Martin Fowler said : <em>don’t even consider microservices unless you have a system that’s too complex to manage as a monolith</em>.</p>

<p>So, it usually makes very much sense to start with a small, colocated team, that has traditional meetings. The trick is to recognize the need to change the paradigm when the team grows, as it always done smoothly over the months. Just don’t forget to have good meeting hygiene (written inputs &amp; outputs), as <strong>even monoliths should be nicely modular</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I posted those 2 articles (<a href="https://blog.pwkf.org/2020/09/26/remote-working-is-a-paradigm-shift.html">Remote-mostly working</a>, <a href="https://blog.pwkf.org/2020/09/27/we-should-only-have-fun-meetings.html">Effective Meetings</a>) internally to my company some years ago, but I’m republishing those publicly to help others the same way it helped us.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Here, we provide more details about a set of novel and standard-compliant
Bluetooth vulnerabilities affecting both Bluetooth Classic (BT) and Bluetooth
Low Energy (BLE).  The uncovered vulnerabilities affect a security mechanism
called cross-transport key derivation (CTKD). CTKD is used to improve the
usability of Bluetooth pairing by allowing to generate BT and BLE pairing keys
just by pairing two devices either on BT or BLE (rather than pairing them two
times).</p>

<p>However, we find that CTKD introduces cross-transport security issues and that
an attacker can abuse those issues to attack BT from BLE and vice versa.  In
particular, our attacks enable to impersonate, man-in-the-middle, and establish
malicious sessions with arbitrary devices by abusing CTKD, while defeating all
the security mechanisms put in place by BT and BLE.  Our work is named BLURtooth
and the related attacks are called BLUR attacks as they blur the security
boundary between BT and BLE.</p>

<p>The team behind this work consists of
<a href="https://francozappa.github.io/">Daniele Antonioli</a>
and
<a href="https://nebelwelt.net/">Mathias Payer</a>
from the <a href="https://hexhive.epfl.ch/">HexHive group</a> at
École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL),
<a href="https://tippenhauer.de/">Nils Ole Tippenhauer</a>
from Helmholtz Center for Information Security (CISPA), and
<a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/kasper.rasmussen/">Kasper Rasmussen</a>
from the University of Oxford.</p>

<p>In the remainder of this document, we provide information on
technical details, disclosure, impact, our proposed mitigation, the response
from the Bluetooth SIG.</p>

<h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h2>

<p>The Bluetooth standard includes two technologies <em>Bluetooth Classic (BT)</em> (also
known as Bluetooth BR/EDR) and <em>Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)</em>. The majority of
mobile devices, including laptops, smartphones, tablets, headphones, and
smartwatches, support both and are defined as <em>dual-mode</em> Bluetooth devices. To
securely use dual-mode devices over BT and BLE a user has to pair her devices
two times, once for BT and once for BLE. As pairing the same device is
considered <em>user-unfriendly</em>, in 2014, with the release of Bluetooth version
4.2, the Bluetooth standard introduced a security mechanism that allows a user
to pair dual-mode Bluetooth devices once (either over BT or BLE) and then
securely use them both over BT and BLE. This security mechanism is called
<em>cross-transport key derivation (CTKD)</em>, and, as the name implies, it enables
deriving pairing keys across different transports (i.e.  derive a BT pairing key
from BLE and vice versa).</p>

<p>Despite being a security-critical mechanism, CTKD is not part of the Bluetooth
threat model and there are no security evaluations of CTKD. Those reasons
motivated us to perform a security analysis of CTKD, resulting in our findings.
In particular, CTKD is affected by 5 major issues (i.e.  vulnerabilities)
enabling an attacker to abuse Bluetooth roles, association, security modes,
keys, and pairing states across BT and BLE. Such issues derive from the <em>lack of
a cross-transport threat model</em> in the Bluetooth standard. The standard
considers BT and BLE with separate threat models and security architectures
while, through CTKD, opens avenues for cross-transport attacks (i.e., attacks
that exploit BT by taking advantage of a vulnerability in BLE or vice versa).</p>

<p>We demonstrate that the identified CTKD issues can be exploited by a remote
attacker in Bluetooth range with the victims. In particular, the attacker can
perform impersonation, man-in-the-middle, and malicious session establishment
attacks while bypassing all the security mechanisms provided by BT and BLE
(including Secure Connections or strong association).  Those are very serious
attacks that violate the security guarantees promised by Bluetooth.  We
confirmed the feasibility of our attacks by testing them on 13 common Bluetooth
devices using 10 unique Bluetooth chips. All of them were vulnerable.</p>

<p>You will find technical details about CTKD, our security analysis, a detailed
discussion of the threads, a discussion, and potential mitigations in our
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11776">BLURtooth preprint</a>.</p>

<h2 id="disclosure">Disclosure</h2>

<p>We discovered the vulnerability in March 2020 and responsibly disclosed our
findings along with suggested countermeasures to the Bluetooth SIG in May 2020.
We kept our findings private and the Bluetooth SIG publicly disclosed them,
without informing us, on the 10th of September of 2020.  Our work is assigned
<em><a href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/589825">CVE-2020-15802</a></em>.</p>

<h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>

<p>The BLUR attacks are a <em>significant threat for all Bluetooth users and
the related vulnerabilities remain 0-days</em>. Our claim
is backed up by our experimental results where we successfully conducted
impersonation, man-in-the-middle, and malicious sessions establishment attacks
on 13 different devices. Our device sample include manufacturers such as
Dell, Google, Lenovo, Samsung, and Sony, operating systems, such as Windows
10, Linux, and Android, and Bluetooth chip manufacturers such as Cypress,
Qualcomm, Intel, Broadcom, and Cambridge Silicon Radio (CSR).</p>

<h2 id="our-mitigations">Our Mitigations</h2>

<p>As part of our disclosure, we provided <em>concrete fixes to combat the BLUR
attacks</em>. In particular, we recommended disabling the capability to overwrite
keys via CTKD in certain circumstances, enforce strong association and Secure
Connections and roles across BT and BLE, disable pairing over BT and/or BLE when
not needed, and add user notifications in case of odd behaviors. Our fixes can
be implemented at the standard level and do not require vendor-specific
features.</p>

<h2 id="response-from-the-bluetooth-sig">Response from the Bluetooth SIG</h2>

<p>At the time of writing, there are <em>no deployed patches</em> to address the BLUR
attacks on actual devices.  The Bluetooth SIG suggested that version 5.1 of the
standard will contain guidelines to mitigate the BLUR attacks (e.g., disable key
overwrites in certain circumstances as proposed in our countermeasures), but
such guidelines are not (yet) public and we cannot comment on them.  The
Bluetooth SIG provides a <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/bluetooth-technology/bluetooth-security/blurtooth/">public statement about BLURtooth and the BLUR
attacks</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article id="post-149171"><div><div><div><div><div><p>Not only the editors and testers were surprised by sudden instabilities of the new GeForce RTX 3080 and RTX 3090, but also the first customers who were able to get board partner cards from the first wave. An interesting pattern of behavior emerged that did not affect all cards or manufacturers and the problems only occurred at certain boost clock rates above or just around 2 GHz. To make matters worse, NVIDIA has obviously also slightly undermined the quality management of the board partners (AIC) due to the secrecy – unconsciously, of course, but with plausible consequences. A chain of adverse circumstances? This could well be the case, because this explains the somewhat diffuse error pattern from the most diverse forums.</p><h3><span><strong>Start of production without real function control?</strong></span></h3><p>Let’s start with the latter, before I get lost in the technical analyses. You probably remember when I wrote that the board partners couldn’t use working drivers yet and only work with a very limited driver and NVPunish. Since the driver problem lasted until shortly before the launch, but the first wave of cards had to be produced already, the functional testing of the first models was obviously limited to power-on and thermal stability. Running, not running. However, this does not say much about the chip quality and the possible maximum frequencies that the respective chip can safely handle.</p><p>Thus, it would at least be plausible that cards could have been sold as OC cards, which wouldn’t have passed a real quality test at the manufacturer with the delivered settings. Real binning? Nothing. Subsequent selection of particularly overclocked cards? Impossible, in fact. And so it is by no means impossible that one or the other “Potato” chip could also have gotten lost on such an OC card. We know the consequences from the posts of the buyers in the relevant forums.</p><h3><span><strong>Wrong component selection? Plausible!</strong></span></h3><p>Now let’s come to the fact that even good chips have dropped out now and then. That they are good, you can see for yourself e.g. by the boost cycle and the temperatures. So it is quite easy to find out with a selected card. This brings us now to a point that I was actually very unconsciously haunting the back of my mind at first, and which then solidified into a realization when comparing the boards of different models So let’s go directly to the “reference board” PG132, which can also be understood as a so-called Base Design. Especially the backside and especially the area below the BGA is interesting. What is interesting about such drawings and the so-called BoM (Bill of Materials) is that you are offered different placement alternatives.</p><p><a href="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Bottom-POSCAP-vs-MLCC.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Bottom-POSCAP-vs-MLCC.jpg" alt="" width="980" height="765" srcset="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Bottom-POSCAP-vs-MLCC.jpg 980w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Bottom-POSCAP-vs-MLCC-300x234.jpg 300w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Bottom-POSCAP-vs-MLCC-768x600.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"></a></p><p>I will (have to) simplify the following for better understanding. Below the BGA we see the six NECESSARY capacitors for filtering high frequencies on the voltage rails, i.e. NVVDD and MSVDD. Apart from the fact that there is still enough high-frequency “garbage” from the voltage converters, it is mainly the so-called GPU load including all jumps caused by boost, which leads to very broadband frequency mixtures, which become more extreme the higher the boost clock goes. The BoM and the drawing from June leave it open whether large-area POSCAPs (Conductive Polymer Tantalum Solid Capacitors) are used (marked in red), or rather the somewhat more expensive MLCCs (Multilayer Ceramic Chip Capacitor). The latter are smaller and have to be grouped for a higher capacity.</p><p>According to the list and specifications of Nvidia, both are possible. In terms of quality, however, good MLCCs are better able to filter the very high frequency components in particular. In the end, this is simple practical knowledge, which only often enough collides with the world view of a financial controller.&nbsp; If one searches the forums, it seems that the Zotac Trinity is particularly affected when it comes to instabilities starting at certain boost clock rates from around 2010 MHz. A feat, because Zotac is relying on a total of six cheaper POSCAPs.</p><p><a href="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Zotac-Trinity.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Zotac-Trinity.jpg" alt="" width="980" height="390" srcset="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Zotac-Trinity.jpg 980w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Zotac-Trinity-300x119.jpg 300w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Zotac-Trinity-768x306.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"></a></p><p>And what does NVIDIA do with its own Founders Editions? One does it obviously better, because I could not reproduce these stability problems with any FE even very clearly beyond 2 GHz (fan to 100%). If something went wrong, it was almost certainly a driver problem. If we take a look at the FE, we see only four SP-CAPs (red) and in the middle two MLCC groups of 10 individual capacitors each (green). This is definitely the better solution and the optimal compromise. because especially the middle areas should best be provided with suitable filters (short circuit of the high-frequency frequency mixtures).</p><p><a href="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Founders-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Founders-1.jpg" alt="" width="980" height="406" srcset="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Founders-1.jpg 980w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Founders-1-300x124.jpg 300w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Founders-1-768x318.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"></a></p><p>If it is only about NVVDD, a single MLCC block may be sufficient to solve the most serious problems. For example, MSI uses only one on the Gaming X Trio, which is theoretically enough, but could have been better solved if, for example, the 2.1 GHz were to be used with water. Whether this is still enough would of course have to be tested. PC Partner, Zotac’s mother company, seems to have recognised this and is obviously changing its cards. By the way, the following example is from a soldering experiment that was NOT made by Zotac, but which confirmed the effectiveness of MLCC smoothing very impressively. One can almost be envious of these soldering skills.</p><p><a href="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hand-made-MLCC.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hand-made-MLCC.jpg" alt="" width="980" height="497" srcset="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hand-made-MLCC.jpg 980w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hand-made-MLCC-300x152.jpg 300w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hand-made-MLCC-768x389.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"></a></p><p>By the way, you also have to praise a company here that recognized the whole thing from the start and didn’t even let it touch them, as the Asus TUF RTX 3080 Gaming consequently did without POSCAPs and only used MLCC groups. My compliments, it fits!</p><p><a href="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Asus-TUF-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Asus-TUF-1.jpg" alt="" width="980" height="439" srcset="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Asus-TUF-1.jpg 980w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Asus-TUF-1-300x134.jpg 300w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Asus-TUF-1-768x344.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"></a></p><p>Interestingly, all board partners are silent on this issue, no matter who you ask. No answer is also an answer, because this behaviour is the absolute exception and almost resembles a muzzle decree. This is because components are normally spoken freely when the launch has already taken place. But here comes nothing but meaningful silence. This also applies to the question of whether the BoM was subsequently changed again to completely exclude the exclusive use of POSCAPs/SP-CAPs.</p><p>Sometimes things are so obvious that you really have to look several times to see them. But once you have understood it, many things suddenly go from nebulous to plausible. NVIDIA, by the way, cannot be blamed directly, because the fact that MLCCs work better than POSCAPs is something that any board designer who hasn’t taken the wrong profession knows. Such a thing can even be simulated if necessary. I will of course stay on it, because my interest is naturally aroused.</p><p>Please read also the latest follow up to that sory:</p><h2><a href="https://www.igorslab.de/en/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-und-rtx-3090-and-the-crash-why-the-capacitors-are-so-important-and-what-are-the-object-behind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 and the crashes – Why capacitors are so important and what’s behind them</a></h2><p><iframe title="Aufgedeckt: Gründe, warum eine NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 oder RTX 3090 oberhalb 2 GHz crashen könnten!" width="1320" height="743" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7YQ7rNgoqMA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p> </div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>Last weekend has been the <a href="https://2020.stateofthemap.org/">2020 State of the Map conference</a> – which did not take place like it was originally planned and as it has been conducted in the past years at a specific physical place (in this case Capetown, South Africa) but was done in a purely virtual distributed form across the internet.</p>
<p>I regard this change – forced by the pandemic situation we all struggle with these days in some form – as in a way a welcome disruption.  Due to an outside event the powers-that-be have been forced to try something they would not have tried probably in many years to come otherwise.</p>
<p>The implementation of the virtual distributed conference as an afterthought on an originally planned physical single place event led of course to some flaws and inconsistencies in the practical setup and to not using the full potential of the virtual setting in all of its aspects.  This is obviously owed a lot to the desire not to throw away work already done.  The most obvious issue resulting from that approach is that the main conference program contained almost exclusively program items submitted by people under the original premise of a physical conference – or in other words:  The chance to hold a talk at the virtual conference still depended on the willingness and ability of people to travel to South Africa and be there for the talk in person.</p>
<p>This means the conference in its program was not even remotely as diverse as it could have been it it had been set up as a distributed remote conference in the first place.  This should IMO be kept in mind by everyone evaluating how SotM 2020 turned out.</p>
<p>I regard the whole event mostly as an experiment to test various techniques and methods and means of communication to have a virtual conference in the OSM context.  This applies both to behind-the-scene infrastructure and the public interfaces.  If the SotM WG documents and shares their findings publicly that could have use far beyond SotM for the OSM community.</p>
<h3>Practical observations from the conference</h3>
<p>The pads for collecting questions and comments on talks worked great.  This is definitely a concept that could play a central role in future distributed conferences.  Initially the questions were asked anonymously which has led in particular in case of Frederik’s talk to quite a lot of people making vile comments under the disguise of anonymity.  It was later established that questions and comments should be signed.  I also think that the use of pads could be extended to non-talk program items like self organized sessions.</p>
<div id="attachment_9119"><p><a href="https://pad.sotm.bitcast.co.za/p/general-feedback"><img src="http://blog.imagico.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sotm2020_pad.png" alt="" width="512" height="429" srcset="http://blog.imagico.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sotm2020_pad.png 512w, http://blog.imagico.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sotm2020_pad-320x268.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></p><p>general feedback pad of the conference – there was a similar pad for questions and comments on each of the talks</p></div>
<p>The attractiveness of the pads to a large extent comes from the real time capability (which is essential for a real time conference obviously) combined with the non-linear free form structure of the text (which contrasts pleasantly with most other real time communication channels that tend to have a strictly linear structure).</p>
<p>There are quite a few things that could be improved about the audio.  This starts with the levels of the pause music relative to the talk audio levels and continues with reverberations in poorly dampened rooms of some presenters and feedback noise in some people’s audio setup.  That is mostly a matter of sufficient testing and experience with setting up and adjusting equipment in a way that works well.  That takes time from everyone involved obviously.  This is the hardest the first time but gets easier once you gain experience.  And i am confident with the corona virus crisis incentivizing many people to gain more practice in remote communication knowledge and experience in this field is much improving every day.  More communication about how to ensure good audio recording and communication quality within the community, sharing experiences and techniques used, would definitely be helpful.</p>
<p>None the less what also became clear to me during the conference is that the willingness of people to engage in communication was very clearly in the order written conversation &gt; audio communication &gt; video.  I think this is an observation to consider for any audio or video conversation in the OSM context.  Video meetings might be very convenient for heavily engaged extroverted community members with a pre-existing prominence but for many people this can be a source of discomfort.  And cultural and language barriers can be strongly emphasized by use of real time audio and especially video communication.</p>
<h3>Comments on the talks</h3>
<p>I have not watched all the talks of the conference so this is more a list of anecdotal observations than a complete review.  All the talks of the main conference program were pre-recorded while the Q&amp;A after the talks were live.  The pre-recorded talks offered a lot of options for presenters which would not be available in a live conference talk and which were used very differently by the presenters.  Ilya in his talk <em><a href="https://2020.stateofthemap.org/sessions/CKYTVS">Send me a Postcard</a></em> IMO showed the most innovative approach to this.  Watching this talk is recommended to anyone who in the future might be in the position to pre-record a conference talk as a positive example.</p>
<p>Some of the talks i watched so far that i consider particularly interesting:</p>
<div id="attachment_9121"><p><a href="https://2020.stateofthemap.org/sessions/RRVNAM"><img src="http://blog.imagico.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sotm2020_allan2.png" alt="" width="512" height="288" srcset="http://blog.imagico.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sotm2020_allan2.png 512w, http://blog.imagico.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sotm2020_allan2-320x180.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></p><p>Allan’s American perspective on the political spectrum of OSM</p></div>
<p>Allan’s keynote <em><a href="https://2020.stateofthemap.org/sessions/RRVNAM">Winds of Change in OpenStreetMap</a></em> – While this did not provide much new information of substance to those following OSMF politics in general and who have read past statements from Allan on that subject, it seems to provide a valuable glimpse into the current mentality of the OSMF board regarding their work.  Although Allan had a prominent disclaimer that these are his personal views and do not represent those of the board, it is quite clear from statements and actions of other board members that they see many of these things similarly.  There is quite a lot of accurate analysis in the talk but also quite a few highly questionable selective perceptions, assumptions and conclusions.  I might comment about some of those separately although it is not clear at this time if the board is currently willing to openly discuss the merits of their views and opinions on the OSM community and the future of the OSM project and on the OSMFs role and defend their views and conclusions on these matters in a public setting.</p>
<div id="attachment_9122"><p><a href="https://2020.stateofthemap.org/sessions/DYXWDC"><img src="http://blog.imagico.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sotm2020_fred.png" alt="" width="512" height="288" srcset="http://blog.imagico.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sotm2020_fred.png 512w, http://blog.imagico.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sotm2020_fred-320x180.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></p><p>Frederik explaining OpenStreetMap</p></div>
<p>Frederik’s talk <em><a href="https://2020.stateofthemap.org/sessions/DYXWDC">There might have been a misunderstanding…</a></em> – As usual Frederik explains in a well understandable way many of the central aspects of the OpenStreetMap project which new contributors as well as data users often struggle with because they differ from what people are used to, either in other internet communities or in the world of geodata.  Naturally, a lot of these frequently misunderstood aspects of OSM are also fairly controversial and this has – as hinted above – led to a lot of critical and in parts insulting comments on the talk by people who would like these things to change and for OSM to become more compatible with their expectations.  What Frederik presents however is for the most part not wishful thinking – presenting how he would like OSM to be – but how OpenStreetMap actually works and functions based on knowledge derived from many years of practical involvement in the project.  Other long term participants will largely be able to confirm that.  So whether you like these aspects of OSM or not and in what direction you might want OSM to develop in the future this is a very useful talk to watch to understand how OpenStreetMap ticks.  </p>
<div id="attachment_9123"><p><a href="https://2020.stateofthemap.org/sessions/RHDUV9"><img src="http://blog.imagico.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sotm2020_mikel.png" alt="" width="512" height="288" srcset="http://blog.imagico.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sotm2020_mikel.png 512w, http://blog.imagico.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sotm2020_mikel-320x180.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></p><p>Mikel mocking concerns about conflicts of interest of corporate employees in the OSMF</p></div>
<p>Mikel’s talk <em><a href="https://2020.stateofthemap.org/sessions/RHDUV9">An Incomplete History of Companies and Professionals in OpenStreetMap</a></em> – Essentially Mikel is painting corporate activities in OSM and their history in rosy colors while saying: just pay no attention to all the skeletons lying around here.  A lot could be criticized about selective presentations of facts as well as factual and logical errors or about the technique of jokingly dismissing and ridiculing differentiated philosophical critique of the influence of corporate interests in OSM.  Anyway – I think this is a valuable talk to watch to get a glimpse into the mindset of many corporate employees involved in OSM as part of or in relation to their job.  </p>
<div id="attachment_9124"><p><a href="https://2020.stateofthemap.org/sessions/DZ8PWQ"><img src="http://blog.imagico.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sotm2020_janet.png" alt="" width="512" height="288" srcset="http://blog.imagico.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sotm2020_janet.png 512w, http://blog.imagico.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sotm2020_janet-320x180.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></p><p>Janet explaining aid work in rural Tanzania</p></div>
<p>Janet’s talk <em><a href="https://2020.stateofthemap.org/sessions/DZ8PWQ">Building mapping communities in rural Tanzania – challenges, successes and lessons learnt</a></em> – I found this interesting because of a certain observation.  In the beginning a number of specific non mapping related examples are shown of aid being given to people in rural areas of Tanzania for everyday life problems.  And emphasis is admirably given to helping locals solving these problems themselves in a sustainable and independent fashion using locally available means.  Yet when it comes to mapping and digital technology the same initiative (and from what i know also many other humanitarian mapping projects) critiquelessly rely on commercial services and proprietary tools and encourage locals to use and rely on those services and tools that increase and perpetuate dependence of local people on non-local corporations for their local mapping work instead of educating people in using open source technology and tools they can manage and control themselves.</p>
<p>To be clear, i am not at all saying that this talk in any way constitutes an example for particularly bad practice in that regard, on the contrary the examples shown illustrate a principal awareness of the issue that is missing elsewhere.  But to me it demonstrates quite well how fundamentally different measures are applied to the goal of supplying aid in a way that enables locals to solve serious problems in a sustainable fashion outside the digital world and within it.  </p>

<p>General Matrix Multiplication or GEMM kernels take center place in high performance
computing and machine learning. Recent NVIDIA GPUs include GEMM accelerators, such as
NVIDIA’s Tensor Cores. In this paper we show how it is possible to program these
accelerators from Julia, and present abstractions and interfaces that allow to do so
efficiently without sacrificing performance.</p>
<p>A pre-print of the paper has been published on arXiv:
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12263">arXiv:2009.12263</a>. <br> The source code can be found on
GitHub:
<a href="https://github.com/thomasfaingnaert/GemmKernels.jl">thomasfaingnaert/GemmKernels.jl</a>.</p>
<p>With the APIs from GemmKernels.jl, it is possible to instantiate GEMM kernels that perform
in the same ball park as, and sometimes even outperform state-of-the-art libraries like
CUBLAS and CUTLASS. For example, performing a mixed-precision multiplication of two 16-bit
matrixes into a 32-bit accumulator (on different combinations of layouts):</p>

</figure>

<p>The APIs are also highly flexible and allow customization of each step, e.g., to apply the
activation function <code>max(x, 0)</code> for implementing a rectified linear unit (ReLU):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia">a <span>=</span> CuArray(rand(<span>Float16</span>, (M, K)))

</code></pre></div><p>The GemmKernels.jl framework is written entirely in Julia, demonstrating the
high-performance GPU programming capabilities of this language, but at the same time keeping
the research accessible and easy to modify or repurpose by other Julia developers.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Let's install OpenBSD on a Lenovo Thinkpad X270. I used this computer for my
computer science studies. It has both Arch Linux and Windows 10 installed as
dual boot. Now that I'm no longer required to run Windows, I can ditch the dual
boot and install an operating system of my choice.</p>

<p>First, I grab my work Thinkpad running Arch Linux and some USB dongle big enough
for the <a href="https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64/miniroot67.fs">amd64 miniroot
image</a> (roughly
five megabytes, that is). This small image does not include the file sets, which
will be downloaded during installation instead. I also download the <a href="https://mirror.ungleich.ch/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64/SHA256">SHA256
checksums</a> from the
Swiss mirror, and verify the downloaded image, before I copy it on my dongle:</p>
<pre><code>$ sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256 
miniroot67.fs: OK
$ sudo dd if=miniroot67.fs of=/dev/sda bs=1M
</code></pre>

<p>The Thinkpad X270 is connected to my network through Ethernet. The WiFi firmware
usually needs to be installed separately, so only Ethernet will work out of the
box. The BIOS has UEFI activated. OpenBSD and UEFI has issues on older hardware
(at least on a 2014 Dell laptop I have), but let's try it on this laptop,
anyway.</p>
<p>I plug in the dongle prepared before, and start the computer. I interrupt
the regular boot with Enter and pick an alternative boot method by pressing F12.
Now I pick my USB dongle. After roughly a minute, the installer has been
started. Now I follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>I choose the option <code>I</code> to install OpenBSD.</li>
<li>For the keyboard layout, I pick <code>sg</code>, for Swiss German.</li>
<li>As a hostname, I simply pick <code>x270</code>, because it's a Thinkpad X270, and I'm not
  very creative when it comes to naming things.</li>
<li>From the available network options (<code>iwm0</code>: WiFi, <code>em0</code>: Ethernet, and
  <code>vlan0</code>: Virtual LAN), I pick <code>em0</code>.</li>
<li>I try to get an IPv4 address over DHCP, which seems to work very quickly.</li>
<li>Next, I type in my very secret root password twice.</li>
<li>I do <em>not</em> start <code>sshd</code> by default, because I don't need to connect to this
  machine through SSH. It's supposed to be a workstation, not a server.</li>
<li>The X Window System should not be started by <code>xnodm(1)</code>, so I leave it to
  <code>no</code>.</li>
<li>Neither do I want to change the default to <code>com0</code>.</li>
<li>I set up my user <code>patrick</code> with my proper name <code>Patrick Bucher</code>, and a decent
  password.</li>
<li>The time zone has been detected properly as <code>Europe/Zurich</code>, which I just
  leave the way it is.</li>
<li>The installer detected two disks: <code>sd0</code> and <code>sd1</code>. Since <code>sd0</code> is the detected
  SSD in my laptop, the UEFI issue from my Dell laptop doesn't exist on this
  computer. I pick <code>sd0</code> for the root disk, since <code>sd1</code> is my USB dongle.</li>
<li>I choose to use the whole disk with a GPT partitioning schema, because it's
  2020.</li>
<li>An auto-allocated layout for <code>sd0</code> is presented. It looks decent to me, so I
  just go with that auto layout.</li>
<li>I don't want to initialize another disk, so I just press Enter (<code>done</code>).</li>
<li>Since the miniroot image does not come with the file sets, I pick <code>http</code> as
  the location for the sets.</li>
<li>I don't use a proxy, and use the mirror <code>mirrog.ungleich.ch</code> and the server
  directory <code>pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64</code> as proposed.</li>
<li>Next, I unselect the game sets by entering <code>-game*</code>. (I heard that they're not
  much fun to play.) I leave all the other sets activated, including the <code>x</code>
  sets, which will be required for the GUI later on.</li>
<li>After those sets are installed, I press Enter (<code>done</code>). Now the installer
  performs various tasks, after which I choose to <code>halt</code> the computer. This
  gives me time to remove the USB dongle.</li>
</ul>

<p>I now restart my laptop, and OpenBSD boots. This takes more time than booting
Arch Linux, which uses <code>systemd</code>, whereas OpenBSD uses <code>rc</code>, which performs the
startup tasks sequentially.</p>
<p>There's a message showing up that various firmware (<code>intel-firmware</code>,
<code>iwm-firmware</code>, <code>inteldrm-firmware</code>, <code>uvideo-firmware</code>, and <code>vmm-firmware</code>) has
been installed automatically. Very nice, indeed.</p>
<h2>WiFi Connection</h2>
<p>Now that the <code>iwm-firmware</code> has been installed, I can connect right away to my
WiFi network <code>frzbxpdb5</code>. I create a file called <code>/etc/hostname.iwm0</code>, wich
<code>hostname</code> being a literal string, and <code>iwm0</code> being the WiFi network card. The
connection to my WiFi network consists of a single line:</p>
<pre><code>dhcp nwid frzbxpdb5 wpakey [my-wpakey]
</code></pre>
<p>Whereas <code>frzbxpdb5</code> is my WiFi network's ESSID, and <code>[my-wpakey]</code> needs to be
replaced by the actual WPA key.</p>
<p>Then the networking can be restarted for that device:</p>
<pre><code># sh /etc/netstart iwm0
</code></pre>
<p>This script is kind enough to set the file permissions of <code>/etc/hostname.iwm0</code>
to <code>640</code>, and then connects to my WiFi network.</p>
<p>I unplug the Ethernet cable and <code>ping openbsd.org</code>, which works fine, even after
a restart.</p>

<p>My GUI on Unix-like systems is based on the Dynamic Window Manager (<code>dwm</code>) and a
couple of other tools, such as <code>dmenu</code>, <code>st</code>, <code>slstatus</code>, <code>slock</code>, all created and
maintained by the <a href="http://suckless.org/">Suckless</a> community.</p>
<p>This software doesn't come with configuration facilities, but needs to be
configured in the respective C header file <code>config.h</code>, and then re-compiled.
Even though OpenBSD offers <code>dwm</code> as a package, customizing and configuring that
window manager requires to build it from source.</p>
<h2>Building <code>dwm</code> and Friends</h2>
<p>First, I need to install <code>git</code> to fetch the source code:</p>
<pre><code># pkg_add git
</code></pre>
<p>Then I fetch the source code for <code>dwm</code>, <code>dmenu</code>, <code>st</code>, and <code>slstatus</code> from <a href="http://suckless.org/">Suckless</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone https://git.suckless.org/dwm
$ git clone https://git.suckless.org/dmenu
$ git clone https://git.suckless.org/st
$ git clone https://git.suckless.org/slstatus
</code></pre>
<h3>Building <code>dwm</code></h3>
<p>Next, I try to build <code>dwm</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd dwm
$ make
</code></pre>
<p>This fails with an error message (<code>'ft2build.h' file not found</code>), which reminds
me of building <code>dwm</code> on FreeBSD roughly a month before. Since I can finde the
header file at another location:</p>
<pre><code># find / -type f -name ft2build.h
/usr/X11R6/include/freetype2/ft2build.h
</code></pre>
<p>I simply can modify the <code>config.mk</code> accordingly by changing</p>
<pre><code>FREETYPEINC = /usr/include/freetype2
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code>FREETYPEINC = $(X11INC}/freetype2
</code></pre>
<p>Actually, I only need to comment the above line, and uncomment the line below</p>
<pre><code># OpenBSD (uncomment)
</code></pre>
<p>The Suckless folks obviously are friendly towards OpenBSD, which is also
noticable in other places (more evidence to be shown further below).</p>
<p>The next compilation attempt succeeds:</p>
<pre><code>$ make
</code></pre>
<p>So let's install <code>dwm</code>, too:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<p>By default, and as to be seen in <code>config.h</code>, the keyboard combination
<code>[Alt]+[Shift]+[Enter]</code> (deeply engraved into the muscle memories of many <code>dwm</code>
users) starts the <code>st</code> terminal. This will be built in a while. However, I
prefer to use the <em>Super</em> or <em>Windows</em> key instead of <code>Alt</code>, since the former
is of no use in OpenBSD, and the latter still comes in handy when working with
the emacs readline mode. Therefore, I change the <code>MODKEY</code> from</p>
<pre><code>#define MODKEY Mod1Mask
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code>#define MODKEY Mod4Mask
</code></pre>
<p>Then I rebuild and reinstall <code>dwm</code>:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<h3>Building <code>st</code></h3>
<p>Let's switch over to the <code>st</code> source directory and just try to compile it:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ../st
$ make
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we get a warning that the function <code>pledge</code> (an OpenBSD mitigation, which
is built into the <code>master</code> branch, but surrounded by an <code>ifdef</code> preprocessor
statement, so that it will only be compiled for OpenBSD) is imported implicitly.
Let's just ignore this warning for now.</p>
<p>What's worse, the compilation fails with the error message:</p>
<pre><code>ld: error: unable to find library -lrt
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the FAQ comes in handy, stating that</p>
<pre><code>If you want to compile st for OpenBSD you have to remove -lrt from
config.mk, ...
</code></pre>
<p>Having done so in <code>config.mk</code>, <code>st</code> compiles without any further issues, and,
thus, can be rebuilt and installed:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<h3>Building <code>dmenu</code></h3>
<p>Even OpenBSD users with Suckless tools have to open another GUI application than
a terminal emulator once in a while. For this purpose, Suckless offers <code>dmenu</code>.
Let's switch over to it and compile it:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ../dmenu
$ make
</code></pre>
<p>Again, we have the issue with <code>ft2build.h</code>, which can be resolved as above with
<code>dwm</code>: by using the proper path for <code>FREETYPEINC</code> in <code>config.mk</code>. Afterwards,
the build succeeds, and <code>dmenu</code> can be installed:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<h3>Building <code>slstatus</code></h3>
<p><code>dwm</code> has a status bar on the top right, which can be used to show various
information. I used to write some shell commands in <code>.xinitrc</code> to compose such a
status line, and then set it by <code>xset -b</code> once every five seconds or so. This
approach generates a multitude of processes every couple of seconds.</p>
<p><code>slstatus</code> is a C programm that is capable of showing various kinds of more or
less useful information. Let's switch over to <code>slstatus</code> and see, what is
available in <code>config.def.h</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ../slstatus
$ less config.def.h
</code></pre>
<p>The comments section lists different functions (<code>battery_perc</code> for the battery
percentage, <code>datetime</code> for date and time information, <code>temp</code> for thermal
information, etc.). I usually display the CPU load, the battery percentage, the
memory usage, the current keyboard layout, and the current date and time.</p>
<p>Before configuring those, let's try to compile <code>slstatus</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ make
</code></pre>
<p>This worked fine, so let's configure the information to be displayed in
<code>config.h</code>:</p>
<pre><code>static const struct arg args[] = {
    /* function    format    argument */
    { datetime,    "%s",     "%F %T" },
};
</code></pre>
<p>This renders the current date as follows:</p>
<pre><code>$ date +"%F %T"
2020-09-05 19:26:38
</code></pre>
<p>I also like to have the weekday included, but not the seconds, so I define a
different argument string:</p>
<pre><code>$ date +"%a %Y-%m-%d %H:%M"
Sat 2020-09-05 19:27
</code></pre>
<p>That's better, so let's use it in <code>config.h</code> (surrounded with some spaces in the
format string):</p>
<pre><code>static const struct arg args[] = {
    /* function    format    argument */
    { datetime,    " %s ",   "%a %Y-%m-%d %H:%M" },
};
</code></pre>
<p>The other settings I like to have do not require any arguments, at least not on
OpenBSD, so I only need to define a decent format string (with <code>|</code> as a
seperator) for those:</p>
<pre><code>static const struct arg args[] = {
    /* function    format           argument */
    { cpu_perc,     " cpu: %s%% |", NULL },
    { battery_perc, " bat: %s%% |", NULL },
    { ram_used,     " mem: %s |",   NULL },
    { keymap,       " %s |"         NULL },
    { datetime,     " %s ",         "%a %Y-%m-%d %H:%M" },
};
</code></pre>
<p>This actually compiles, so let's install it:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<h2>Configuring X Startup</h2>
<p>Now that all software is compiled and installed, let's run X. To do so, a file
<code>.xinitrc</code> in the user's directory is …</p></div></div>
